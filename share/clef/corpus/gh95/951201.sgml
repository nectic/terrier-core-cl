CAIRO: Egypt's ruling party was headed for an overwhelming victory in
parliamentary elections which opposition parties said were rigged on a massive
scale.
The National Democratic Party won 87 of the first 96 seats decided in
Wednesday's first round of voting, during which at least four people were
killed and about 100 injured. Opposition candidates warned the polls could
create a shift in support of violence by militant Islamist groups seeking to
topple the government.
Libya arms seized
GENOA: Italian police have seized 10 tons of sophisticated combat aircraft
parts which were headed for Libya in contravention of a UN embargo imposed
after the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Investigators believe British, American, and
Canadian companies supplied the equipment found in two containers, one on a
Libyan-bound ship in the port of Genoa and the other at Turin airport.

Doctor honoured
LOS ANGELES: Dr Jack Kevorkian, the Michigan-based GP who has helped
terminally-ill people to commit suicide, has been named winner of the 1995
Sovereign Fund award for contributing to individual freedom in the United
States. ``No personal right could be more basic than the legal right to live
and die as one chooses,'' said Kurt Simon, chairman of the private fund.
US backs Solana
WASHINGTON: The United States has signalled support for Spanish Foreign
Minister Javier Solana as Nato's next secretary general. Officials said a broad
consensus was forming to back him in the US and Europe, and the appointment is
expected to be formally made next week, when Nato Foreign Ministers meet in
Brussels.
Shelling kills 17
KABUL: At least 17 people were killed and 26 wounded when rockets slammed into
a busy market district in central Kabul yesterday. The attack followed a
government victory against the rebel Islamic Taleban militia on Tuesday night.
On Sunday, at least 39 people were killed and 140 wounded in an air raid on
Kabul for which the government blamed the Taleban.

Walesa son free
WARSAW: A Polish appeal court has ruled one of President Lech Walesa's sons,
convicted of causing a road accident while drunk, will not have to go to jail.
The court suspended and cut a two-year jail sentence on Przemyslaw Walesa, 21,
after hearing psychiatrists' reports that he was not fully in control of his
actions.
Leeson cash-in
SINGAPORE: Former futures trader Nick Leeson is today making his second court
appearance in Singapore to reveal his plea to charges of committing fraud and
forgery in the collapse of Barings Bank. Capitalising on his misfortunes, a
merchandising frenzy in the republic has resulted in a new cocktail called the
``Bank Breaker'', a teeshirt proclaiming ``Barings Learns a Leeson'', and a
board game called ``In the Nick of Time''.

SACKED Arsenal manager George Graham continues to hit back at his detractors by
insisting that he has been made a scapegoat for some of the wider ills in the
game.
In a magazine interview, the former Highbury manager claimed: ``I was a
high-profile manager, a successful manager, and the FA were determined to make
an example of me. It was as if the rest of football's sleaze would disappear
overnight if they could nail me. But if they think that, then they are just
kidding themselves.''
Graham is still adamant that Arsenal should have backed him. ``They backed me
for four or five months,'' he said. ``Then, when the Premier League inquiry
team unearthed some `new evidence,' which, in my opinion, was questionable
anyway, they took only a couple of minutes to sack me.
``At the very least I expected the club to wait until I was actually charged
with something or until the FA had actually announced a verdict. That is what
is happening at other clubs. There have been numerous other allegations, about
players as well as managers, but the other clubs are standing by their staff.''
Graham admits at being surprised by Radio Five's decision to drop him. ``I was
disappointed,'' he said. ``The BBC hired me after the FA hearing. They knew I
was banned and they knew the reasons I was banned. They knew everything about
me. And they were great to work for. I just felt a bit embarrassed for the
producer who hired me.
``He had to tell me that my contract was being terminated. I felt a bit for
him, because it definitely wasn't his decision. It was people upstairs at the
BBC pulling strings.''
Graham says he still has a deep affection for Arsenal. ``Nothing has changed,''
he said. ``I've had a great love for the club since my days as a player in the
70s. I still have a lot of friends there and in the stands at Highbury. And
they're good friends. It's just that they're not on the board of directors.''
But there is one thing that confounds him about Bruce Rioch's new Highbury
regime. ``The money the club is now spending and the salaries it is paying.
That has shocked me,'' he said.

RANGERS' controversial midfield player Paul Gascoigne was handed a one-match
ban yesterday after the much-publicised meeting of the SFA Disciplinary
Committee.
That will be added to a similar punishment which the player must serve after a
booking in the Old Firm game last month carried him over the penalty points'
mark for the season.
The Ibrox reserve-team coach John Brown also was given a single-match
suspension following an incident in the same game, against Aberdeen at Ibrox,
which brought Gascoigne to the SFA headquarters at Park Gardens in Glasgow
yesterday.
Two more players, Alan McLaren, of Rangers, and Aberdeen's Billy Dodds, had
their cases continued because of ongoing inquiries into the game. The players
asked that the matter be dealt with at a later date and this was accepted by
the football authorities.
The explosive nature of the match between Rangers and Aberdeen on November 11
had brought the four players in front of the Disciplinary Committee, and while
television evidence is not yet accepted, the views of the referee supervisors
have become important to the committee.
That was the soccer area yesterday which was most argued as Alan Lawrence, of
Hearts, and Airdrie's Sean Sweeney also were dealt with on what the supervisor
said and received one-match suspensions.
Later, both Rangers and the Players' Union leader Tony Higgins expressed
concern at the growing involvement of the supervisors and the possible
undermining of the authority of the referees.
In a statement issued from Ibrox late yesterday afternoon, Rangers spelled out
their long-term worries over the situation.
They said: ``We accept the SFA Disciplinary Committee's decision today and, in
the circumstances, are of the opinion that, on this occasion, we have received
a fair hearing from the Association.
``We continue to believe, however, that a referee supervisor should not be
utilised as a second referee in the stand and, if this were to become a
practice, we are convinced that this would have a very damaging effect on our
game and would totally undermine the authority of the match officials.
``Whilst accepting the Committee's decision, we believe that certain aspects of
the reporting of disciplinary matters require close scrutiny and we will be
raising this with the Scottish Football Association.''
Higgins repeated the worries of the growing influence of the supervisor and
added: ``We cannot allow the authority of the referee to be undermined. That
would be wrong.
Higgins represented the players yesterday and revealed that the Ibrox men had
been instructed by club director Donald Findlay not to answer direct questions
about the various incidents. Higgins, in fact, answered on behalf of the
players.
SFA chief executive Jim Farry insisted later: ``I hope that this matter is now
at an end. The Disciplinary Committee has dealt with the matter fairly and we
would hope that this is the end of the affair.''
The Rangers-Aberdeen clash, and its various incidents, were highlighted by
television and, while referee John Rowbotham took no action, the players were
summoned to appear because of the report of supervisor Donald McVicar.
Similarly, Alan Lawrence was called up because of an off-the-ball clash with
Rangers' defender Craig Moore, which was also seen by a referee supervisor.
Airdrie defender Sean Sweeney's kick at the grounded Dundee midfield man Morten
Wieghorst in the Coca-Cola Cup semi-final at McDiarmid Park was in the same
category. However, Sweeney will miss a total of six games because this offence
carries him into a points situation which already brings with it a five-game
ban.
Dumbarton goalkeeper Ian McFarlane was suspended for five games after being
red-carded twice in a game against Airdrie on November ll.
Gascoigne will miss matches against Partick Thistle and Motherwell - again, he
had exceeded the points total which counts for automatic disciplinary action.
The rumblings over the role of the superisor will continue but, surely, once
teleision evidence is admitted, that problem will vanish.

THE Stock Exchange has dealt a blow to traditional market-making by deciding to
launch an order-driven dealing system where investors will post firm prices at
which they are prepared to buy or sell a specific number of shares.
In contrast, market-makers are obliged at all times to quote firm prices at
which they will buy or sell shares, deriving an income from the spread between
the buy and sell prices. Institutions complain that this makes dealing more
expensive, particularly for routine trading.
Market makers fear that an order driven system will take business away from
them and have resisted a move towards away from the present system. The
Exchange has decided to bow to institutional pressure and plans to have an
order-driven system up and running next August.
The move is also expected to help London's competitiveness as a share-dealing
centre in Europe, where order-driven trading methods are the norm.
Matthey setback
JOHNSON Matthey has suffered a setback in its car pollution control business,
it revealed yesterday. Operating profits from converters business slumped by
#5.7m to #12.5m in the six months to September 30. Overall pre-tax profits for
the metals and components group were #47m compared with #45m. The interim
dividend is lifted to 4.4p from 4.2p with earnings at 16.7p against 15.9p.
Enterprise post
GRAMPIAN Enterprise yesterday named Professor Alan Sim as its new chief
executive to take over from the retiring Hance Fullerton in February. Professor
Sim, who defeated 120 applicants for the post, is presently employed in
Aberdeen by both McDermott Marine Construction as division director and The
Robert Gordon University as the BP Professor of Engineering Education.
MEPC warning
MEPC said conditions in the UK property market remained tough, despite
reporting a lift in its own profits yesterday. It made pre-tax profits of
#122.6m in the year to September 30 compared with #105.9m in the previous 12
months. Total dividends stay at 20p on earnings per share increased to 21p from
20.1p.

GREAT Britain's success in securing a place in the Atlanta Olympics is having a
disruptive effect on the Scottish indoor season, writes Joseph Dillon.
Rhona Simpson, Susan MacDonald, Diane Renilson, Susan Fraser, and Pauline
Robertson have all been instructed by the British management to take a break
from hockey until the turn of the year.
This will be a blow to Edinburgh Ladies as they start their programme tomorrow
at the Bell's Sports Centre at Perth. They are attempting to win the title for
the fourth successive year, but will be deprived of three of their players.
Also affected is the Scottish squad, currently in training for the finals of
European Nations' Cup in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall from January 26 to 28.
It means coach Andrew Scoular is now in a quandary whether to select his squad
on previous form or to wait until the Great Britain players are free from their
restrictions to stake their claim for places.
Meanwhile Edinburgh Ladies have been recruiting new talent. Their drive has
been so successful that they will be putting out two teams in the league this
season, with Pentland competing in the second division.
Despite the influx of new players, Edinburgh will find it difficult to retain
their title. They play all their main contenders before Christmas.

q Saturday: Aberdeen and District Motor Club's Williamson Rally, an event of
long standing, starts in the evening from Hatton, and brings the East of
Scotland rally championship to a close for another year.
q Sunday: West of Scotland Kart Club finishes its racing season with a meeting
at the Summerlee Raceway, Larkhall. There are no more kart races on Scottish
circuits during 1995.
q Sunday: Marking the end of a series of forest rallies which began in February
with the Snowman, the South-West Saab Galloway Hills Rally virtually takes over
Gatehouse of Fleet for the day.
Although it comes after the end of the Scottish Rally Championship, it usually
attracts a fine entry of both Scottish and Irish crews, being convenient for
the ferries at Stranraer and Cairnryan.
The organisers always manage to provide a very compact route. This year, the
first car leaves Gatehouse at 09.30 and should be back at the finish within
four hours or so. There are five forest stages totalling about 40 miles. Most
of the action is around Clatteringshaws and Cairn Edward, but this time there
is also a stage at Glengap.
Prize-giving is at the Murray Arms around 16.00.

'TIS the season to be jolly - and that's the trouble. Even the word ``jolly''
is used as a synonym for mildly drunk. This is the month when over-indulging in
drink is not only condoned, it is positively encouraged.
Repeated advertising campaigns have helped to alter public opinion about
drinking and driving but the misuse of alcohol, even at work, still tends to be
either covered up or ignored.
Attitudes, though, are beginning to change. Such surveys as have been carried
out suggest a definite shift toward both management and employees adopting what
are usually described as ``more appropriate'' drinking habits, especially
during the working day. The idea of a drink to ``help'' you through the day or
to unwind at night is seen by more and more people for what it is: a danger
sign of serious problems to come if action is not taken.
There are more serious considerations. Under regulations inspired by the
European Union and introduced two years ago, employers must make an assessment
of health and safety risks to their staff and take preventative measures. An
employer who allows a worker to threaten his own or others' safety through
drink is opening himself up to actions for damages and perhaps prosecution. And
action is increasingly being prompted by employers. More than 60% of the
managers questioned said their company had an alcohol policy.
The most common policies were to ban drink from the premises, to ban any
drinking at all during the working day or to forbid employees to be ``under the
influence''.
Many leading employers participate in awards called A Working Concern, the
first Scotland-wide scheme to recognise alcohol policies at work. It is run by
the Scottish Council on Alcohol (SCA), a charity to promote sensible drinking
and the first agency in Britain to promote the idea of alcohol policies in the
workplace.
The awards are supported by CBI Scotland, the Scottish TUC, Scottish Office,
Scottish Enterprise, the Confederation of Scottish Local Authorities, and local
councils on alcohol.
More surprisingly, they are sponsored by the Portman Group, which is funded by
Britain's eight biggest drink producers including Guinness which includes
United Distillers, Allied Distillers, Scottish &amp; Newcastle, and Seagram.
``It is necessary to get the drinks industry's motives straight,'' says its
director Dr John Rae. ``They are principally commercial. The industry knows
that unless alcohol misuse can be reduced by education and by measures that
target particular problems, governments may impose across-the-board
restrictions.
``We make no secret of the fact that we are funded by the drinks industry and
that we hope to prevent across-the-board restrictions.''
The awards scheme was designed to stimulate further interest by rewarding
employers. There are still many employers who have not yet developed alcohol
policies.
Awards are not made simply for banning drink. Policies should have a clear
procedure to deal with the misuse of alcohol and must promote sensible drinking
throughout the company. There must be a strategy for prevention and to
encourage staff with problems to accept help as soon as possible. One example
is to insist that those who have to be disciplined for an occurrence which
involved drinking in some way have the chance to seek treatment from an
approved source without it appearing on their work record.
If he or she refused to admit there was a drink problem, the disciplinary
procedure would continue as normal.
At what point drink becomes a problem may vary with the individual. Current
health guidelines advise men not to take more than 21 units of alcohol per
week, less for women, and that two or three days a week should be ``dry'' days.
Some experts prefer the term ``drink dependence'' to alcoholism. Relying on a
couple of quick drinks after work and ``social'' drinking which depends on
rounding up anybody available to drink with are unhealthy habits.
``It is important for all companies, no matter how large or small, to establish
policies that encourage a responsible attitude to alcohol and identify and help
individuals who may have problems,'' says Dr Rae.

KAREN Pickering, the Commonwealth champion, could finish only seventh in the
final of the 100 metres freestyle at the second World Short Course
Championships in Rio yesterday.
Pickering landed a bronze medal two years ago at the inaugural championships in
a British record time of 54.39 seconds. However, she was never on that pace in
Brazil and finished last in 55.52 - more than two seconds behind winner Le
Jingyi, from China.
``I could not believe it when I turned and saw the scoreboard. I kept waiting
for them to change my time,'' said Pickering.
She felt her first 50m in the morning heats had been slow and explained: ``I
tried to go out faster in the final and perhaps I kicked too hard, which is
something I tend to do when I try to go faster.''
With the start delayed by more than an hour because of a power failure,
Pickering said she had been distracted when European champion Franziska van
Almsick, of Germany, was disqualified for a false start.
The German's long-awaited battle with Le Jingyi never took place as the German,
in an outside lane, was thrown out after the judges decided she had voluntarily
false-started.
It was a good day for Australia, with Scott Miller winning the men's 100m
butterfly, Susan O'Neill the women's 200m butterfly, and Matthew Dunn the men's
400m medley.

NOW that November and the Scottish Motor Show are behind us, it may seem an odd
time of year to be hankering after an open two-seater, writes ROSS FINLAY. But
an informal poll of friends and colleagues who attended the show made it clear
that, in retrospect, one car they all fancied was the Fiat Barchetta.
A rather more sophisticated affair than the brute-force Austin-Healey 3000 with
which it shares this page, the Barchetta is the most recent vehicle to show
that the Styling Centre in Turin, which also designed the closed Fiat Coupe, is
being given its head.
Some designers employed by major companies mutter privately that their
employers prefer to play safe. Fiat under Paolo Cantarella is certainly not
like that. The Coupe is a real eye-catcher, with wing ``slashes'' that very few
of Fiat's rivals would have taken a chance with on a full production car. And
the Barchetta combines modernity with real international style.
As the example on the stand at the SECC showed, there is something exactly
right about the side elevation and rear view of the Barchetta. The very
slightly curving seam which runs above the front and rear wheel arches, and
dips a little at the door, jogs the memory of anybody familiar with Fifties
sports-racing cars.
A little like a Cooper-MG, or the Tojeiro-Bristol, or the Tojeiro's
production-car counterpart the AC Ace. All these British designs were virtually
straight copies of the car whose unofficial model name the latest Fiat revives
- the Tipo 166 Ferrari Barchetta by Superleggera Touring of Milan. It won at Le
Mans in 1949, and Ascari raced one the following year at Silverstone, where it
obviously struck a chord with our own sports-racing men.
The present Barchetta comes with a new twin-cam 1747cc engine which peaks at
130bhp. Fiat sees no chance of there being a big enough UK market demand to
justify converting it to right-hand drive, but LHD versions are available to
special order at #13,995.
Left-hand drive can be a real pest in this country, although there were enough
keen types interested in the Lancia Delta Integrale to justify a few sales
here. But the Barchetta looked terrific on the motor show stand. What impact
would it have out on the open road?

FORMER world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson will fight Buster Mathis Jr on
December 16 - despite a decision by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission to
bar the fight from taking place in Atlantic City.
The NJCCC ruled that staging the fight in New Jersey would violate a ban on
casinos doing business with Tyson's promoter, Don King. But, hours later, King
announced that the fight was being moved along the east coast to Philadelphia.
King's casino-service licence was suspended by the state last year after he had
been charged with fraud. Earlier this month, a mis-trial was declared in King's
case, but the charges are still pending.
Tyson is due to fight Britain's WBC champion, Frank Bruno, in March.

Yorkshireman Wharton defends his European super-middleweight crown against the

for a crack at WBC champion Nigel Benn.
Duff has secured the rights to stage Wharton's second defence with a purse-bid

PETER Beardsley hopes to help Newcastle take a giant step towards their first
Wembley final in 20 years by beating Arsenal in a quarter-final of the
Coca-Cola Cup at Highbury early in the new year.
Reading face a daunting trip to Leeds, while there is a Midlands derby with
Wolves at Aston Villa, while the fourth tie seeks replay untanglement, with
Middlesbrough or Birmingham at Norwich or Bolton.
However, the Highbury clash is the one that will set the pulse racing, pitting
two in-form strike forces against each other - 21-goal Ian Wright and Dennis
Bergkamp versus 24-goal Les Ferdinand and Beardsley.
While #6m Ferdinand has contributed 18 to the Geordie haul, it is Beardsley
that double-winners Arsenal will fear most. He scored twice as Newcastle won
3-2 at Highbury last season, and then hit the St James' Park winner in March.
Reading, 50-1 outsiders, will not travel to Elland Road without hope. It is
more than 22 years since the Yorkshire side made a successful run on Wembley
and they were eliminated from the competition last season at Mansfield and held
at home by Notts County this term.
Wolves, too, are beginning to dream of Wembley, despite their lack of manager
and the woeful start to the season which cost Graham Taylor his job.
They defeated Coventry to set up another intriguing Midlands tie at Villa Park,
with history favouring Villa, the most consistent side in a competition they
have won four times.

BRITAIN will be pushing its EU partners to make its next shake-up of the CAP
even more radical than outlined, the Minister for Agriculture Douglas Hogg said
yesterday, writes KATHERINE BUTLER.
In Brussels, where farm ministers got their first opportunity to mull over the
long-awaited strategy paper on the future of agriculture policy Mr Hogg
welcomed the move to scale down supports in advance of EU enlargement to
Eastern Europe.
The approach outlined by the European Commission in the document fell short of
radical reform, Mr Hogg said. He added: ``This is a useful strategy, but we
wish to go much further.'' He said Brussels should begin to tackle the next
wave of reforms as a matter of urgency. According to the strategy paper devised
by EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler, extending the CAP to ten former
Communist states will add #12bn a year on to the EU's farm bill. However, it
says reform is essential irrespective of enlargement because of internal
budgetary pressures and Gatt World Trade Commitments.
Mr Fischler is proposing a deepening of the 1992 MacSharry reforms, which imply
a new round of price and quota cuts. But he also wants to link direct payments
more closely to environment friendly farming and to schemes which make farmers
``the stewards of the countryside.''
The shake-up would involve a radical simplification of the CAP. Mr Fischler
said the policy had become so complex that farmers could not understand it, let
alone the general public.
But he is also suggesting that Brussels devolve responsibility for much of the
day-to-day running of the CAP to national governments, including some of the
handling of direct income supplements. That is seen as a dangerous precedent
which could eventually undermine the foundations of the 30-year-old common
policy.
Irish minister Ivan Yates said to allow governments to boost their farmers
incomes out of national exchequers would in effect mean the beginning of the
end of the CAP. He vowed that Ireland would block the proposal and said he
could rely on France and Germany to block any radical change.
The Fischler paper envisages that eastern European countries will join the bloc
around the turn of the century and gain full admittance to the CAP by the year
2010.

THE sport's ability to handle its affairs has been called into question
following the decision to hold an extraordinary meeting of shinty's ruling body
to discuss the handling of the appointment of the new administrator.
The short-leet for the position - shinty's first full-time professional
administrator - will be drawn up today but the meeting to discuss the handling
of the interview selection process is threatening to overshadow what should be
seen as a major step forward for the game.
Monday night's meeting, to be held in Fort William and chaired by the
association's past-president Ken Thomson, has been called following the
decision by current president, Duncan Cameron of Glasgow, to apply for the new
job. Shinty's part-time secretary/treasurer, Alister MacIntyre, of Fort
William, also has confirmed he will be a candidate.
It has transpired that once Cameron informed members of the executive council
that he was to apply for the post, another member of the executive, Douglas
MacKintosh of Newtonmore, vice-chief, contacted executive members to discuss
the handling of the job applications.
The up-shot was a claim that 14 of the 16 members of the executive expressed
``concern'' about the way the job specification had been drawn up, and
presented to a recent meeting of the executive.
Monday night's meeting will therefore centre on Cameron's alleged failure to
declare an interest in the new job, and the handling of the preparations for
the new post. The move is being interpreted in some quarters as an attempt to
influence the outcome of the application process.
Cameron as president, was to have been a member of the six-strong selection
panel, but withdrew on announcing his interest in the post. He is understood to
be convinced of the propriety of his actions and ready to respond to any
allegations to the contrary at Monday night's meeting. He is virtually certain
by then to be on the short-leet for the post.
The original plan announced by the association involved a further meeting to
conduct interviews, and it had been hoped that the new official would be in
place around the New Year. Whether that will now be the sequence of events will
depend on the outcome of Monday's meeting.
The feeling among members of the executive contacted by The Herald this week is
that, while any suggestions of officials being ``underhand'' in their dealings
with the job application may be well off the mark, there is a need to clarify
the handling of the affair.
How the executive hope to do that when the job applications have already been
processed to the short-leet stage is not clear. Nor is it apparent what effect,
if any, the unseemly situation will have on the many aspiring candidates who
now await news of who is to be interviewed and when.

<HEADLINE>WORLD BANK STUDY Australia and Canada emerge as richest countries</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CHRISTOPHER SIMS</BYLINE>

<RECORDNO>975110159</RECORDNO>

AUSTRALIA and Canada emerge as the world's richest countries, with wealth
estimated at $835,000 and $704,000 per capita respectively, according to a new
study by the World Bank which includes natural resources, capital assets and
human capital.
These countries emerge on top because of their natural wealth and relatively
low populations. The UK at 22nd with $324,000 per head comes further down the
list than is usual in such comparisons of wealth, just below Finland, which
benefits from its vast forests, and also below Italy. The poorest country,
Ethiopia, is worth just $1400 per capita, so that on this basis Australia is
almost 600 times richer.
The World Bank warns that figures for individual countries can only be rough
estimates but that they give a good idea of regional patterns. The study
attempts to get beyond the usual bald gross domestic product which is the usual
way of assessing relative wealth.
It tries to assess each country's natural capital such as forests and soil
quality, adjusted for degradation caused by human activity; man-made capital,
which gives a country its productive capacity through its manufactured assets
and infrastructure, and human capital, meaning investment in education, health
etc.
This approach produces some surprising findings. Surinam for example has GDP
per head of under $3000 but take account of the other forms of capital and its
wealth jumps to no less than $389,000, which is really a measure of its
potential if its natural wealth was harnessed.
The main finding is the vital role of human capital. This exceeds both natural
and man-made capital combined in importance in the vast majority of cases. Yet
conventional economics take no account of it. Man-made assets represent a fifth
at most of the wealth of most countries studied, yet it is on this that ``the
bulk of current economic policy focuses,'' as the study's author Ismail
Serageldin points out.
It boils down to the simple fact that the most important single parameter for
economic development in the long-term is education. Another important factor is
saving. For most countries these are the first building blocks for prosperity
and development will happen if they are in place. Establishing a basic
infrastructure should not be the first priority, though it will quickly follow.
The East Asian countries have basically followed such an approach and of course
have not looked back. The exact benefits of investment in human capital are
difficult to measure in monetary terms, whereas the advantage of high savings
rates are more obvious in terms of high capital formation. People in the
fast-expanding East Asian economies save a lot partly because they don't have a
western-style social security safety net which forces government spending to be
much higher as a proportion of GDP than in East Asia.
It may seem obvious that education and health are prerequisites for continuing
economic development, though this could be questioned. For example the early
stages of the industrial revolution were not marked by a surge in popular
education and better health, though conditions were improving for the budding
entrepreneurial class.
Human capital cannot develop if there is insufficient social capital, meaning a
stable political and cultural framework. How a society is organised and the
legitimacy of its institutions are clearly important but it is difficult to see
how this can be measured.
There is evidence that societies with a rich matrix of non-governmental
associations between people, meaning anything from choral societies to
parent-teacher associations, rather than those with autocratic vertical
institutions, have better government.
However the latter have certainly not held back the East Asian countries so
there may be cultural bias in this conclusion which was arrived at after
research in Italy. More work is being done on this and on how the
morale-sapping effects of unemployment and underemployment affects well being
and economic success.
It is becoming clearer what makes economies take off, though translating this
knowledge into politically acceptable policies is another matter. Making growth
sustainable in the long-term and compatible with low inflation and without
degradation of the environment is still a question which economists will ponder
for years to come.

<HEADLINE>Bank chairman warns there is a risk that the softness in UK economic activity will continue Royal cashes in with record results</HEADLINE>

THE Royal Bank of Scotland has set any potential bidders pondering after
producing record full year results, with pre-tax profits rising 13% to #602m.
However, the more meaningful figure is the 20% rise before the inclusion in the
preceding year of the #52m gain on the bank's stake in the 3i venture capital
group.
There were improvements in all the major activities which is unusual for bank
these days.
The most important factors were the #70m reduction in the bad debt provisions
to #112m and the #3000m increase in UK lending as the headline figures.
But chairman Lord Younger warned that, while there are good reasons to expect
that economic activity in the UK will show some rebound in the coming year,
there is a sigificant risk that the present softness will continue.
He said that despite the speculation, there had been no takeover approaches and
there were no suspicious nominee shareholdings.
The staff will benefit to the extent of a #30m profit-sharing bonus which will
be equivalent to 8.8% on basic salary and worth on average about #1200.
There was a brief flurry of excitment and amazement when a newswire said that
the Royal was in merger talks with the Bank of Ireland. But it soon emerged
that its highly successful Citizens banking group in New England, with assets
of over $10bn, was in preliminary talks to merge with the $4000m asset-based
Bank of Ireland First Holdings, which owns the First New Hampshire Bank.
Talks are at an early stage, but the consideration would seem unlikely to
exceed $400m (#260m).
Citizens itself increased pre-tax profits by 57% to #107m and since its
acquisition for $250m in 1988, has never lost money unlike all other banks in
New England. It is increasingly becoming ever more core to the Royal and, given
the strength of its capital ratios, it may be somewhat flummoxed as to what to
do with any money it did receive from a sale.
The high profile Direct Line insurance division raised profit by #2m to #112m
in a highly competitive trading sector, where premiums have been hit by 10%
over the year.
Founder Peter Wood said that there are now 2.2 million motor-policty holders
with Direct Line, which is the only major insurer making money out of
underwriting. That is partly through cost control, with the expense of each
Direct Line policy having fallen from #61 to #46, compared with an industry
average of around #100.
Household business had been less competitive, with there being 725,000 policy
holders as at the end of September. Mr Wood said he is now determined to attack
the building societies' share of the market. He expects motor rates to increase
sharply, probably in a year's time once weaker competitors are squeezed out of
the market.
The UK branch banking side continued to benefit from the Project Columbus
reorganisation and employee refocussing programme, with the taking of back
office tasks out of the branches. That has also included much better credit
control to the extent that chief executive George Mathewson does not, at
present, expect any cyclical rise in defaults.
He added that, as valuations for property and other assets have remained low,
there has not been any inflated lending. The underlying bad-debt position may,
in fact, be better than it looks as centralised control has removed many of the
``hope'' non-provisioning by individual managers who previously had not
reserved adequately against some loans.
The south of England is still lagging in recovery, with the North East of
England and Scotland the most bouyant as far as the Royal in concerned.
The one third stake in the Newton Investment Group brought in #2m for nine
months and seems set to become a steady earner as a highly successful fund
management associate.
Treasury operations rose a quarter to #104m, although its finding meant some
recourse to the wholesale money markets and reduced interest spreads.
The dividend total has been raised 18% to 16.2p, with an 11.6p final. To
prevent speculation as to future interim payments, it has been decided that
they will be one third of the total for the preceding year, so that the next
one will be 5.4p.
Royal's shares rose 10p to 557p, where they yield 3.6%.

HANSON's days as a sprawling conglomerate appear to be over. The group intends
to concentrate on four strategic sectors and as such expects to realise #2000m
from disposals within the next 12 months.
Around #450m of this will come from the sale of its stake in the National Grid
and the remainder from the disposal of non-core businesses. However it refused
to comment on speculation that its Cavenham forest products business might be
sold.
The disposal programme will go some way to reducing Hanson's hefty debt pile
following its recent #2900m acquisition of Eastern Group, the regional
electricity company (REC). It contributed #7m to group profits. Gearing in the
wake of the Eastern acquisition stands at 130%.
Chief executive Derek Bonham is very enthusiastic about the acquisition which
was made at a price below those seen in subsequent bids, for what he said were
less attractive RECs.
There is thought to be scope for the Peabody coal business and Eastern to
collaborate on international power projects in the Far East and Australia. It
is not unusual for Hanson to have such high debts immediately after a bid.
Interest cover remains healthy at four times.
The tighter operational focus is aimed at maximising future cash flow which
will help to boost dividends. The company decided to hold its dividend at 12p
believing that the money saved is better spent investing in the business.
However, it remains committed to a progressive dividend policy. Mr Bonham added
that following the USI demerger many UK shareholders had in effect had a 9p
payout in addition to the 12p cash dividend. ``Shareholders have had a
tremendous deal,'' he said.
Capital expenditure in the year rose by 70% to #442m with much of the money
spent on projects to increase capacity and improve productivity. Spending on
strategic development projects has also been stepped up.
At an operational level its businesses performed well with a notably strong
performance from its Quantum chemicals business in the US, whose profits rose
nearly fourfold.
It benefited from strong price increases due to a shortage of ethylene.
However, other US businesses turned in record performances. There was a record
group operating profit from continuing operations of #1486m, an increase of 44%.
Within the UK businesses, Imperial Tobacco continued to increase its share of a
stabilising domestic market. Duty free and international sales did well. The
ARC aggregates business did well considering the problems with demand in the
construction industry. Production cut-backs in the industry and stable prices
and margins enabled Hanson Brick to increase its profits by 65% to #38m.
Whilst Quantum's profits are expected to slip from their exceptionally high
level they are expected to remain healthy. Actions throughout the businesses to
improve efficiency should keep group profits on an upward path.
The company will hold its bi-annual strategy presentation in mid-January and
will also give an update on progress within Eastern Group.
Hanson shares gained 3p to 1951/2p.

AT LEAST 175,000,000 days are lost to employers every year through
stress-related illnesses. This is more than a third of the 500m days lost
through sickness absence - while hangovers account for a further 8m to 14m
days. But if employers and staff know how to cope with problems, many such
absences can be avoided. The Employee Counselling Service (ECS) in Glasgow
provides counselling and training to that end.
``The employers we deal with have long recognised that there were problems they
couldn't ignore,'' says Pauline Bryan, director of ECS. ``Even though they
mainly happen in an employee's private life.
``They recognise that people don't always leave their personal problems at the
door, that they do sometimes bring them in to work.''
The service is a charitable body which has offered one-stop access to
professional help and counselling for nearly 20 years. It provides a
confidential, independent service away from the workplace, in an environment
where troubled employees can speak more freely about their problems.
Referrals come about either voluntarily, when the employer asks the employee to
attend, or as the result of disciplinary action where personal problems are a
contributory factor. Occasionally employees refer themselves.
``About 15% of referrals are self-referrals, the rest come through employers,''
says Bryan. ``Problems vary between men and women. The most common problem for
men is alcohol abuse, followed by stress.
``For women it's personal family problems, followed by alcohol, then stress.
Alcohol isn't always the main problem - it could be bereavement or some
traumatic event the person is using alcohol to cope with.''
Stress is a huge contributor to employee absence, and it is now an issue which
employers are being forced into taking seriously. A Northumberland County
Council worker successfully sued his employers after being forced to leave work
due to stress, setting a legal precedent for others.
``Employers are now realising how they suffer from employees' stress - and of
course they've been suffering all the while,'' says Bryan.
``There's nothing worse than an unplanned absence, and if someone has to get a
sick line for stress-related illnesses such as anxiety or depression the
employer could be losing them for months.
``It's important to have a strategy for recognising stress, offering internal
and using external support so people can talk freely about their problems
outside the work environment. We've developed a training strategy to encourage
personnel managers to recognise the symptoms.''
Public training, arranged and conducted at the service's headquarters in
Glasgow's Oswald Street, covers the factors that make people vulnerable to
stress, understanding the duty of care and Health and Safety Executive
guidelines.
Training is also provided in assessing levels of stress and developing a
strategy to deal with it. In-house training concentrates on improving the
skills of management in spotting stress and on finding appropriate staff to act
as volunteer counsellors on a range of subjects.
``If the company has a harassment policy we train the volunteer counsellors in
how to cope with harassment,'' says Bryan.
``Often people at all levels have received some training in counselling skills
so they recognise how far they can help and when to move on. We help equip
people in companies to deal with other people's problems.''
This year has seen a significant rise in the number of referrals being dealt
with by the service. While this shows that more employers are adopting an
understanding approach, it can mean problems for counsellors.
``We've increased our counselling hours, but it's very demanding for our
counsellors.'' says Bryan. ``We have to build in to each day a chance to deal
with the feelings counsellors are experiencing.
``All counsellors who work as a team share information - they don't use names
or details but they learn from each other - it's part of their development and
offers great help and advice.''
As a charity, ECS provides counselling free to employers and employees. There
is a charge for training, however, to supplement the funding donated by
Strathclyde Regional Council, CBI Scotland and STUC, among others.
ECS might be non-profit-making, but lack of money might mean employers have to
contribute more. ``It is becoming harder to depend on donations and training to
supplement our grants,'' says Bryan.
``We hope always to be able to supply a subsidised service, and we've tried to
maintain an open-door, drop-in-any-time service but employers are probably
going to have to start meeting more of the costs.''

HAVE you noticed the correlation between the evolution of a particular sport
and the culture in which it exists? The more you appreciate the subtle changes
in your sport, the more apparent this theory becomes.
Take horseracing, for example, the long existence and scale of this sport and
industry is a perfect case in point. You'll have to think about it because a
history lesson, this is not.
For now, consider the changes within the 1990s. The behaviour patterns of the
sport's most ardent followers are on the move again; sociologists need not be
surprised by the news. Before I elaborate, as a racecourse manager the news is
good. If you are an off-course betting shop manager, however, don't completely
give up on the lottery - you may just need Mystic Meg to do you a big favour.
In my opinion, the betting-shop punter is becoming an ageing market. The
habitual visitor who frequented these havens when they first became legalised
is either approaching 60, more than 60, or in the land of constant winners. The
quick success experienced by off-course betting shops 30 years ago    surely
resulted in the benefactors taking the levels of      business for granted.
Meanwhile, social habits have evolved, not to mention the growing competition
for the punter's pound. Our society   now demands value for its leisure spend -
competition insists upon it.
Even with their smarter interiors, quality pictures, and convenient locations,
the betting shop experience cannot provide today's sports fans with that vital
sense of involvement, suspense, and thrill that is sought from the leisure
investment. Here lies the exciting opportunity for racecourse    managers.
Despite the issues of transport to the racecourse, admission prices, catering
choice. If racecourses can satisfy in these respects, the racing fan will still
perceive a trip to the races as a far superior experience and better value for
money. The collective benefits of attending the meetings instead of catching
the 3.30 at Kelso between the 3.28 at Hackney and the 3.42 at Romford, are soon
appreciated by those looking for quality leisure time.
A competitive leisure industry has allowed each of us to become a connoisseur
of our chosen hobby. Sedentary jobs encourage us to be more active in our
leisure pursuits; increasing urbanisation forces us to seek out fresh air,
green grass, and large spaces; either hard work and stress, or the monotony of
unemployment, make us crave for excitement, glamour, and natural beauty. Live
horseracing, fellow Millennium Crusaders provides all of these things.
This behaviour evolution is becoming more widely recognised. With innovations
such as Sunday racing and various promotional activity by racecourse
executives, the customer-mix out on the racecourse is increasingly family-based
and broad-ranging. The solitary flat-capped, wax coated, Morris Minor driver
has become the exception amongst a recent influx of women and children,
corporate executives, and professional colleagues surrounding the paddock
studying the form.
Hamilton Park, located on Glasgow's doorstep, illustrates this mini-evolution
and it is exciting to be part of the metamorphosis. Our mid week evening
meetings are competing strongly for the city pub and wine bar trade-lads, you
may as well eye up a leggy filly whilst you sup your pint (or in our case
girls, check out the best dressed studs) spending an evening with your friends,
instead of succumbing to yet another smoke-filled evening in the west end.
The lottery is also doing its bit for horseracing's social status, if
indirectly. Short-term, the bookmakers are bemoaning the fall-off in betting
turnover. The concept of gambling, however, has experienced a quantum leap in
the credibility stakes. Horseracing is being supported by banks, accountants,
lawyers, and the like to an unprecedented extent. Nobody questions the morality
of a flutter any more, in fact in sheer probability terms let alone
entertainment, it makes infinitely a more sense to stake #1 on a runner in an
eight-horse race than buy a scratch card.
The appeal of a #1 bet on a five-to-one-shot compared to the scratch card for
entertainment value, there is no contest.
So now that gambling is fully accepted by modern society, horseracing stands to
benefit, particularly the tracks.
Racecourses even have a safety net in place should the current level of
betting-shop closures continue. This is in the form of a recently launched
television Racing Channel. Now punters can bet from home using a satellite
channel dedicated solely to horseracing - the first single sport channel of its
kind.
Racecourses earn a substantial income from the provision of pictures of live
horseracing in to betting shops. If this income was to fall significantly it is
anticipated that the Racing Channel will help mop up the lost business.
Furthermore, the Racing Channel has wide horizons, stretching as far as the
gambling-mad Asian continents.
Who knows the limits of this new source of potential revenue with today's
communication technology.
Look out for form guides appearing on the Internet. Information and
communication technology is advancing at such a pace surely the 33-1 winner is
quickly becoming a thing of the past, but then again racing's greatest charm is
to expect the unexpected.

MIDLOTHIAN'S David Peacock landed the CIS Insurance Scottish Indoor Singles
Championship at Coatbridge last night when he edged out club-mate and defending
champion Paul Conlan 7-4, 6-7, 2-7, 7-3, 7-5 in a 39-end, three-and-a-quarter
hour final.
Peacock, who arrived in Scotland just last week from Australia after having
married his new wife Kim, made a great start in the first final between players
from the same club.
A new ruling introduced by the SIBA that allowed the reigning champion to
defend the title, enabled the two men from the east to set up a final clash,
and Peacock came from having been 1-3 down in the opener to win it 7-4.
The second set turned into a ding-dong battle, and with seven ends played the
scores were tied at 6-6, but it was defending champion Conlan who got the vital
single to tie things up at one set apiece.
``I was disappointed to lose that end. Had I managed to get the shot and gone
2-0 up, I knew it would have been a long way back for Paul - and it was
particularly disappointing when he went on to take the next set,'' said Peacock.
Conlan dominated the third set, restricting his club-mate to just two singles
as he ran out a 7-2 winner.
However, Peacock got a good start in the next with a single and a 3 that took
him 4-0 ahead. The title holder replied with two singles but Peacock went on to
take the set 7-3 in seven ends.
Conlan picked up an opening-end 3 in the deciding set before Peacock replied
with a double to be just one down at 2-3. With five ends completed, Conlan was
still in front at 5-3, but Peacock counted a sixth-end single to put the match
back in the melting pot.
On the next end Peacock picked up a double but was left regretting a missed
opportunity. He failed with an open draw with his last bowl of the end to add a
potential match-winning third shot, but was only delaying the celebrations.
A single on the next enabled him take the set 7-5 and win the title.
``I knew it would be tight and that's the way it turned out,'' said Peacock.
``There was nothing between us and it was just my turn on the day. We know each
other's game so well that it was always going to be a dour battle.''
In the earlier semi-finals, both players had come from behind after having
dropped the opening sets in their best-of-three encounters.
Peacock lost the opener to Cumbernauld's David Miller 1-7, took the second 7-6,
and saved game in the decider before going on to complete a 7-5 win.
``I thought it was all running away from me during the early stages but I stuck
in well in the second and when I won it it gave me a boost for the last,'' said
Peacock.
Conlan also lost his opening set against East Lothian's Angus Blair.
He forged into a 5-2 lead after four ends, but Conlan, who had played on the
same Coatbridge carpet earlier in the week in the CIS Masters, counted three
shots on the fifth end to tie the scores at 5-5. However, Blair got the
set-winning double on the next end.
Conlan then took an early advantage in the second set, opening with a maximum 4
and then went on to complete a 7-4 win.
n DAVID Peacock defeated Paul Conlan 7-4, 6-7, 2-7, 7-3, 7-5 in the final to
take the indoor singles title.

SUCCESS breeds success it seems, as far as the Menzieshill club is concerned.
They grabbed pole position after the opening hostilities in the indoor league
last week, and yesterday, they sealed a new sponsorship deal.
They will now have the financial support of the Dundee-based training and
development company Insights, indoors and out.
Andy Lothian, Insights' managing director, confirmed that their interest in the
club was ``an attempt to put something back into the sport.''
Lothian, a former Scotland Under-21 internationalist, continued: ``I gained a
tremendous amount from hockey and I now want to give the youth of Menzieshill
the same opportunity.''
Menzieshill return to league duty at the Bell's Sports Centre, Perth, on Sunday
and, like their nearest challengers MIM, they face two meaningless contests as
they are already assured of their places in the second phase. The pressure,
however, will be on CIBA Kelburne, Insights Inverleith, Torbrex Wanderers, and
Touche Ross Gordonians as they attempt to avoid the two places still to be
decided in the relegation play-offs.
Kelburne's position now looks to be beyond recall. They are still without a
point and their experiment to field such a young side has backfired on them.

WHEN England hosts next year's European Championship, it will be the ultimate
test of their status as an acceptable, paid-up member of the football
community. Excommunicated following the Heysel disaster, re-admission merely
marked the beginning of England's period of probation - and they will be
restored to a state of grace only with the trouble-free staging of Britain's
largest sports event since the 1966 World Cup.
As manager of the national team, it is essential that Terry Venables be above
reproach, free from any whiff of scandal. Despite repeated reaffirmation of FA
support, the intensifying scrutiny of his controversial career may yet force
the conclusion that even an innocent Venables represents the unacceptable face
of international football management.
The Department of Trade and Industry, following an 18-month investigation, has
concluded that Venables should not face any criminal proceedings. However, the
DTI is pursuing him over the activities of four of his companies during his
term as Tottenham Hotspur chief executive.
They have sent the England coach a 10-day letter detailing their intention to
commence proceedings which could result in him being barred from holding office
as a director of a limited company for up to 15 years. The letter expires next
week, whereupon court proceedings will start with the issuing of a summons.
One-time dance-hall singer Venables insists he will fight the action, and the
Football Association has vowed to stand by their man. ``Terry Venables is
employed as coach to the England football team and will continue to be so. Our
position remains unchanged,'' said an official statement yesterday.
Venables' solicitor, Ian Burton, believes there will be no court appearance
before next autumn - until after the tournament. ``It's inconceivable that this
litigation will distract from his preparations for the European Championships
and he has told the FA that,'' said Burton.
Defiant against mounting public and media criticism, Burton added: ``It has
been suggested that he should not have been chosen for the job or should not be
allowed to continue.'' Such allegations, he says, should be ``scotched.''
Despite investigations by the Serious Fraud Office, the Metropolitan Police,
and the Department of Trade and Industry, no evidence of criminal wrong-doing
had been unearthed, insists Burton.
Yet once again, Venables was under tabloid assault this week, with a story
alleging that he had admitted to authorising a #50,000 payment to Frank
McLintock's First Wave Sports Management agency involved in the #2.1m deal
which took Teddy Sheringham from Nottingham Forest to Tottenham in 1992.
FA rule 36 (c) states: ``All transfers and registrations shall be arranged
directly between the clubs concerned (and the player) and not through or by an
agent.'' According to the Daily Mirror, Venables broke that stipulation. The
Sheringham transfer has been the subject of an FA inquiry for the past two
years. Venables asserts: ``It is definitely not my signature on that invoice.''
He has proved adept at brushing off tabloid rantings in the past. He was
vitriolic about the campaign to deny him the England management: ``All of a
sudden I'm a crook, I'm naive, I'm a fraud, and I'm out of the running for the
England job. That's hard to take.''
However, he was effusive and forgiving when he announced he had landed the
England job.
The clash of East End egos with Spurs chairman Alan Sugar, which saw Venables
voted out as chief executive in May, 1993, was followed by two TV programmes,
Panorama and Dispatches, which made potentially ruinous allegations regarding
how he had raised his #1m share of the funds which rescued Spurs. The police
could find no evidence of any irregularity.
Sugar remained adamant he would not cross the White Hart Lane threshold until
FA president Sir Bert Millichip intervened, saying Sugar had a duty to let the
England manager in.
When assaults came, as they twice did recently, from the bastion of the
business establishment, The Financial Times, the heat has intensified however.
Venables' knowledge of the game and his talents as a coach are beyond reproach.
The enigmatic manager is acknowledged to have a special way with maverick
players.
He has been known to describe himself as a sharp cookie from Dagenham, and much
of what he has touched has turned to gold. But his first entrepreneurial effort
was pure Tel Boy. The Thingummywig - an improbable a hat with artificial hair
aimed at housewives who wished to shop while wearing curlers - was not a
success.
Yet within a year, aged 18, he became the first professional footballer to turn
himself into a limited company.
Venables was on the stage at four, with the Happy Toppers dance troupe. He sang
with the Joe Loss Orchestra while playing with Chelsea and negotiating every
rank of international football from schoolboy cap to full England
internationalist. TV panellist, pub and club owner, novelist, TV scriptwriter -
he has done it all, usually with panache and style.
When he was interviewed for the Barcelona management, and the president,
Jose-Luis Nunez, was embarrassingly out of cigars, Venables, with a flourish,
pulled up his trouser leg and produced two from his sock.
He was brought up three streets away from where Alf Ramsey was raised - seen
almost as a blue-chip reference - but his appointment by the FA was much
debated, hailed as deeply disconcerting, with the credibility of the game
effectively dependent on his probity. Though nothing has been proved against
Venables, an even greater disquiet exists today.
Tel Boy has now assumed aspects of the personna of the fictional East End
character, Arfur Daley: within the law, but ducking and diving, trying to put a
brave face on adversity, and stoutly defending what some allege is indefensible.
The Football Association can do little about the potential for damage by
England's hooligan supporters, but can they afford a maverick ringmaster
controlling the show?

TV FOOTBALL
THE decline of prestige sport in public service broadcasting accelerated
yesterday when the BBC surrendered live coverage of the FA Cup final to
commercial rivals ITV.
That is the headline detail in a three-way #130m deal, dominated by satellite
broadcasters Sky, for the rights to the Football Association's major properties
for four years from 1997 onwards. The BBC also loses highlights of England's
international matches, but will keep its Road to Wembley FA Cup highlights in
return for a #15m contribution to the package.
Quite simply, the BBC could not find enough licence payers' money to compete
harder for the game that has been the jewel in its sporting crown since 1937.
``Obviously it will be a wrench to give up live coverage of the FA Cup Final
after so many years, but it is becoming clear that the huge escalation in the
rights fees for live domestic football has put some events beyond the reach of
the BBC's licence fee,'' the Corporation admitted.
Yesterday's developments are another blow for terrestrial television. ITV were
only better placed to bid for the final because on Monday they lost out in a
five-year, #125m Football League deal to Sky, who gained the best of
yesterday's package. They will broadcast live games from every round, plus live
replays, and will continue to show all of England's home internationals live.
ITV will show a live FA Cup match on Sunday afternoons from rounds three to
six, as well as one live semi-final and the final. They will also show
highlights of midweek replays from round three onwards.

NEW Zealander Frank Nobilo charged home with six straight birdies for a course
record 64, and a one-shot lead, in the first round of the Greg Norman Classic
in Sydney yesterday.
On the way to his nine-under-par score, Nobilo played the treacherous back nine
at the testing par-73 The Lakes course in a seven-under 30.
Australian Craig Parry, playing in tougher late afternoon conditions, also
mounted a birdie charge over the closing holes for an eight-under 65 and second
place.
Parry picked up four shots in the closing five holes, including holing a bunker
shot for an eagle 3 at the fourteenth.
Nobilo's fellow New Zealanders, Grant Waite and Michael Campbell, share third
place at seven under.
Tournament host and world No.1 Greg Norman, fresh from victory in the
Australian Open last week, is eight shots adrift. Norman held the previous
record of 64 at the venue, set in 1978 on a different, par-72, layout.
Open champion John Daly, partnering Norman and Nobilo, shot a one-over 74 to be
10 shots off the pace. Leading scores (Australian unless stated):
64 - F Nobilo (New Zealand).
65 - C Parry.
66 - G Waite (New Zealand), M Campbell (New Zealand).
67 - D Fardon, S Appleby, S Bottomley (Britain).
68 - C Gray, B Faxon (U.S.), P Senior, T Price.
69 - G Evans (Britain), I Stanley, M Cain.
70 - J Clifford, D Dunakey (U.S.), G Dodd, M Goggin, S Robinson, J L Guepy
(France), R Pampling, W Riley.
71 - J Senior, N Smith, L Peterson, P Lonard, P O'Malley, A Bonhomme, J Wagner,
J Senden, P Devenport (New Zealand), S Leaney, A Stolz, J Morse (U.S.), M
Allen, S Bouvier.
72 - D Podlich, J Evans, R Stephens, S Collins, G Norman, L Stephen, P
Fitzgibbon, S Owen (New Zealand), A Cejka (Germany), D McKenzie, T Gale, E
Droop, L Tinkler, B Ogle, D Hill, D Smail (New Zealand), M Clayton.

KEITH Barwell has launched a #1m bid to buy Northampton - with the promise of
more money to come. The Courage League Division 2 leaders' 2500 members will be
asked at an extraordinary general meeting on Sunday week to support the move,
writes Derek Douglas.
Former Scotland coach Ian McGeechan is now director of rugby at Northampton and
Scottish internationalists Gregor Townsend and Mike Dods were recruited during
the close season. Barwell already has the support of McGeechan and club captain
Tim Rodber.
``I have given the club certain assurances that they will have the right to buy
back the controlling interest of the club,'' said Barwell. ``In the future I
see additional sums of money being required. They will be available. I believe
this is the final brick in the wall which makes us very, very powerful.''
Northampton are the latest club to be offered financial help in the game's new
professional era. First division Saracens have been boosted by a #2.5m
injection from a local businessman, and Sir John Hall has pumped millions into
second division Newcastle.
Barwell, 51, who made his fortune out of free newspapers, first approached the
club with his offer six months ago.
Northampton now want to change from being a members' club to a private limited
company, Northampton Rugby Football Club Ltd.
There would be 1.4m shares issued. Barwell would invest #1m and be the majority
shareholder and chairman of the company. A further #400,000 - the value of the
club's assets - would be put into a trust on behalf of the members, who would
have a three-strong representation on the board.
Saints president Roger Harwood said: ``The club wants to remain in the top
flight of rugby union and to do that we have to go down the road to
professionalism.''

A MALE police constable allegedly wearing only a bra and pants smiled at young
girls from his door, a court was told yesterday.
Mr Brian Murphy is also said to have waved at children while he was completely
naked, the court heard.
When a concerned mother went to a police station and told Mr Murphy where her
children claimed to have seen a flasher, she said he replied: ``It can't be,
that's where I live.''
Mr Murphy, 24, of East Moulin Road, Pitlochry, was in the dock yesterday
accused of exposing himself at his home in an indecent manner in the presence
of four young girls.
He is also charged with alarming the same girls plus another young girl and a
boy while wearing bra and pants.
A 10-year-old girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - told Perth Sheriff
Court that as she walked past the house ``the door opened and there was a
person standing there in bra and pants.''
She told the court that she noticed stubble on the face and added: ``I called
it an `it' because it had a man head and lady clothes.'' She described two
similar incidents.
The girl, who was with her older sister or friends at the times of the alleged
incidents, identified Mr Murphy in court as the person at the doorway,
explaining, ``I recognise him from the house.''
The mother of another ten-year-old girl said that another parent had been told
about the alleged incidents and her child and her seven-year-old sister had
told her the address on East Moulin Road.
She drove the girls to identify the house and said they both pointed and said
``that's the one'' when they passed it.
The mother then went to report their claims at the police station where Mr
Murphy was behind the desk.
She said that Mr Murphy had later said: ``I live there with my wife'' when told
the address.
Mr Murphy denies the charges alleged to have happened between April 1 and May
18 this year.
The trial, before Sheriff John McInnes, continues.

A SPECIAL rescue team was called into action yesterday to save a worker trapped
inside one of the towers that supports the Forth road bridge.
The team from Fife used ropes to manoeuvre themselves from road level down a
150ft shaft in the tower to get to the 56-year-old man, injured after an object
hit him on the shoulder and neck.
The team secured a safety harness round him and, using ropes, guided him the
remaining 50ft to the bottom of the tower. The man, as yet unnamed, was
transferred to a waiting boat and then to hospital, where he was treated for
minor injuries.
q Meanwhile, Labour MP Brian Donohue hit out at Government delays in bringing
out a report on the structural state of the Forth Rail Bridge.
Mr Donohue, the only Scottish member of the Commons Transport Select Committee,
said the timetable for bringing out the report was slipping.
Mr Donohue, MP for Cunninghame South, said: ``We have been waiting for the
Health and Safety Executive report since last March, and now a further delay
has occurred in its publication.
``I am told that the main reason why this report has been delayed is because
Railtrack has not yet carried out the structural investigations as requested by
the HSE to the required standard.
``This further delay must raise more questions about the reluctance of
Railtrack to have their maintenance policy for the Forth Rail Bridge
scrutinised independently.
``This report has already been delayed long enough. It should be published as
soon as possible.''

TOMORROW'S second semi-final in the Royal Liver UK Assurance Championship in
Preston will be an all-Scottish affair between defending champion Stephen
Hendry and second favourite John Higgins.
Higgins last night ensured the clash every snooker fan wants to see with a
hard-fought 9-6 win over Mark Williams.
After having trailed 3-0 in Wednesday's first session and struggled for much of
the contest, partly due to a damaged tip, the Sct found his touch to win the
last three frames with breaks of 60, 94, and 79.
Higgins is out for revenge after losing to Hendry in last month's Skoda Grand
Prix final, a meeting that proved an anti-climax after the hype surrounding
their first meeting as professionals.
``I think we showed each other too much respect and I am sure this will be a
cracking match,'' said Higgins, who was relieved that Williams missed a simple
last pink in the tenth frame which could have put the Scot two frames behind.
He added: ``I'm sure Mark's turn will come - he is one of the best potters in
the game.''
Earlier in the day, Hendry had booked his place in the last four when, leading
6-2 from their first session, he went on to complete a 9-3 victory over
Dubliner Ken Doherty.
The world champion did not have a century break in the match and said: ``I have
set myself such high standards that everyone expects me to knock in centuries
all the time.''
The semi-final line-up was completed when left-hander Andy Hicks shocked former
champion Ronnie O'Sullivan by overturning a first-session deficit of 5-3 to win
9-7.
The world No.17 from Devon, who also reached the last four at this year's world
championship, had been written off at the halfway point by the bookmakers - who
made O'Sullivan, winner of the title in 1993, 1-14 to book a meeting with Peter
Ebdon today.
Hicks was on offer at 13-2 - but was still not tempted into a wager. ``I never
bet,'' he said after taking his second major scalp in successive rounds, having
previously seen off James Wattana 9-8 with a brilliant 67 clearance.
Hicks pulled back to 6-6 helped by a run of 64 in the twelfth frame and never
went behind again, eventually finishing off the match with a magnificent black
to take the sixteenth frame 78-64.
O'Sullivan said about that superb pot from Hicks: ``I did not think Andy would
have a go, but it was a great shot. Andy is good under pressure and pots the
important balls you need to win matches.
``Of course I am disappointed, but you cannot cry or sulk. Snooker's only a
game and there are a lot more unfortunate people out there than me.
``Just look at Christopher Reeve - he's really brave and manages to smile, so
I'll not start complaining.''

MANCHESTER United supporters have bought their way into today's shareholders'
meeting to demand price cuts at Old Trafford. Members of the club's independent
supporters association have invested on the stock market as a way of gaining
access to the club's annual meeting so they can ask for a drop in admission
prices in the wake of record #20m profits.
``Supporters have been buying shares so that we can confront the board with
questions direct from the terraces,'' says association secretary Andy Walsh.
``The club has refused to meet representatives of our organisation to talk on
matters we have raised with them. By buying shares we hope we can get them to
listen to the fears that fans have for the welfare of the club.''
Chris Robinson, the independent supporters' chairman, says he is worried that
young fans are being driven away from the club by high ticket prices. ``United
has developed a youth policy on the field which is the envy of all others. A
similar policy must be adopted off the field if the club is to attract and
retain supporters.''
The supporters' pleas may not fall on deaf ears. United chairman Martin Edwards
says the club will review admission costs in the New Year. ``We have not fixed
prices for next season and I am sure this is something shareholders are going
to be asking about.
``What I can say is that we are aware that over the last few years prices have
gone up and that is mainly due to developing the ground. When we set prices for
next season we will take that into consideration.''

TRACEY Craik's decision to invest in an experienced caddie continued to pay off
for the Scot when she extended her lead with a third round of 70 in the
American Express Tour qualifying school tournament at La Manga Club in Spain
yesterday.
It left the former Scottish girl champion at three under par on 213 to take a
four-stroke lead over Tracy Loveys from Dorset into today's final round.
Anne-Marie Knight from Australia lies third on 218, one stroke clear of
American Debbie Doniger.
It was also a good day for Scotland's Myra McKinlay after a disappointing
second round of 80. A 73 yesterday left her sharing eleventh place on 224, and
looking good to earn an exempt place on the 1996 Tour.
Craik usually carries her own clubs, but this week, she enrolled the help of
Julie Forbes' brother, Steve, a one-handicap member of Aboyne. ``I tend to rush
my shots when I am on my own, but Steve has slowed me down,'' she said.
Craik's 70 hardly flattered her impressive striking. A No.5-wood to 15ft
yielded an early birdie at the fourth on her way to the turn in 35, then she
struck a No.3-iron to 15ft for another birdie at the tenth.
Loveys, a teaching professional from Broadstone, worked hard to keep Craik in
her sights. She dropped shots at the first two holes, birdied the third, then
executed a fine recovery from a greenside bunker to within a yard of the hole
for a birdie at the long eighteenth. Leading third round scores (GB &amp; I unless
stated):
213 - T Craik 71, 72, 70.
217 - T Loveys 72, 73, 72.
218 - A-M Knight (Aus) 75, 69, 74.
219 - D Doniger (US) 72, 77, 70.
220 - S Melin (Swe) 75, 74, 71.

RESEARCH shows that the ``liquid lunch'' is disappearing from the working day -
though alcohol continues to be misused by some employees in a worrying way.
One survey, which excluded teetotallers from its figures, nevertheless showed
that 60% of senior British managers never drank alcohol at lunchtime and 24%
did so less than once a week.  When the whole workforce was questioned, 71%
said they never drank alcohol at lunchtime and 12% did so less than once a
week; 32% had never drunk during the working day; and 41% said they drank less
than they used to.
The reason for not drinking varied but 96% agreed that they wanted to keep a
clear head throughout the working day. Those who did drink during the day
usually had no more than a pint and a half of beer or two glasses of wine, with
men tending to drink more than women.
Yet one major Scottish company found that 23% of its male workers regularly
drank between 21 and 50 units of alcohol a week, and 18% of women drank 14 to
35 units, putting them into the ``at risk'' category. A unit is a glass of
wine, half pint of ordinary-strength beer or a measure of spirits.
Eleven per cent of male workers drank more than 50 units a week and 2.5% of
women more than 35 units, putting them into the ``in danger'' category. For
women in the 17-30 age group, this percentage doubled to 5%.

THE dynamic Derbyshire duo of Dominic Cork and Devon Malcolm stopped South
Africa in their tracks yesterday.
But England captain Mike Atherton must have feared the worst during the first
day of the second Test at Wanderers in Johannesburg.
It was he and manager Ray Illingworth who had handed the hosts a route to
riches by deciding to bowl first on a pitch that performed precious few tricks.
But, by close of play, England's spirits were high again - thanks to Cork and
Malcolm.
Between them, they reduced South Africa to 278 for seven after part-time
spinner Graeme Hick had ended a stand of 137 by dismissing a third Derbyshire
player, Daryll Cullinan.
For something like five hours yesterday, England looked on course for the most
humiliating of hidings.
England gambled, and it worked in the end with big Dev knocking over
century-maker Gary Kirsten and Dave Richardson when he was thrown the second
new ball.
Take away Cork's magnificent figures of four for 74 from 27.5 overs, however,
and the visitors would have been in a right state.
Almost every time a boost was needed, the 24-year-old provided one in a manner
that impressed another man who used to provide cricketing miracles on a regular
basis. Ian Botham, now a media pundit, watched and nodded his approval.
Cork gave England a flying start by dismissing Andrew Hudson for a seventh over
duck, an away-swinger lobbing to Alec Stewart in the gully via bat and pad,
while bowler and most close catchers appealed for lbw.
Then, after Kirsten and Hansie Cronje had feasted on some wayward bowling to
add 71 runs in just 17 overs, back came Cork to achieve a breakthrough just
before lunch.
South African skipper Cronje collected six 4s off Darren Gough and Angus Fraser
on his way to 35. But he could only edge another cracking delivery from
England's man of the morning.
At 75 for two, the gamble to bowl first was just about intact. It appeared
hopelessly off target three hours later, however, as rock solid left-hander
Kirsten and Cullinan compiled a partnership of 137.
Kirsten did not give a chance in his maiden Test century. It needed an unlikely
bowling hero to engineer an escape route.
Hick persuaded Cullinan to push forward 14 runs after his reprieve and this
time Russell held a routine opportunity off the outside edge.
That, insisted Cork, was the opening England knew they could exploit. Jonty
Rhodes, whose Test place is already under threat, made just five before pushing
tamely at the Derbyshire all-rounder.
And when the second new ball was taken, Malcolm forgot all his troubles, put
thoughts of technique behind him, and simply concentrated on steaming in. It
worked like a charm.
Kirsten's near six-hour innings, containing sixteen 4s, ended on 110 with a
catch behind following a tired drive. And, three balls later, Richardson turned
away from a bouncer to give Russell his fourth catch - lobbed up off the bat
handle. But, fittingly, the day finished with a Cork celebration. Brian
McMillan was pinned in front of his stumps.

FIVE Steaua Bucharest players have been banned for two years for attacking a
linesman on a train, the Romanian Rugby Union Federation have said.
``The Steaua players were punished because such behaviour is unacceptable,''
said FRR general secretary Sorin Fuicu. Earlier this month Steaua lost their
lead in the domestic rugby union championship after having gone down 6-3 in a
match at Universitatea Baia Mare.
On their return trip to Bucharest, the five Steaua players struck one of the
linesmen who happened to be on the same train.
The five men - Nicolae Dragos, Leodor Costea, Lucian Colceriu, Marius Nedelcu,
and Costica Florea - have played for Romania's national team in the past few
years.
``They are not only banned from playing in Romania, but also in any country
affiliated to the International Rugby Union Board,'' Fuicu said.
q.MILAN and Italian internationalist flanker Massimo Giovanelli has been given
a 60-day ban for headbutting in a European Cup match against the Welsh side,
Pontypridd, last month.
The Italian rugby federation said the ban was handed down by the cup organisers
for the incident on November 22. It means Giovanelli will miss six matches up
to January 20.
Milan lost to Pontypridd    31-12, ending their hopes of progress in the
inaugural European Cup.

THE prospect of entire flocks of sheep facing slaughter on welfare grounds will
become a reality as the mites which cause sheep scab become resistant to
available insecticides, according to Dr Gerald Coles, a senior research fellow
at Bristol University.
There are only three types of insecticide available - pyrethroids, invermectin
and organophosphates. Scab mites have been found to be resistant to
pyrethroids; a suspected case of resistance to invermectin has been recorded
and organophosphate resistance has been described abroad.
``When - not if - sheep scab develop resistance to all three groups in the UK
we will have to go over to slaughtering flocks on welfare grounds,'' says Dr
Coles, writing in The Sheep Farmer.
``If, as seems most likely, multiple resistance occurs in common grazings,
large stretches of countryside could lose their sheep flocks. But it does not
have to happen.''
Dr Coles, who admits to being concerned by the spread of sheep scab in the UK,
advocates an approach to sheep control in line with that of New South Wales,
Australia. There sheep health is improving under farmer-owned, farmer driven
health schemes.
``The technology is already available to eradicate a number of sheep diseases
in the UK, including scab lice and keds. A decision has to be made on what to
control. Obviously scab and lice will come at the top but worms and foot rot
should not be far behind.''
Dr Coles insists that local control schemes must be driven by local farmers -
not the Ministry of Agriculture. That way the farmers will be determined to
make it work. Farmers in a control area would have to provide a certificate of
the disease status of sheep being sold to another farmer.
``Get it wrong and you might be sued,'' he warns. ``You might be served with a
quarantine order only permitting you to sell on to an abattoir. If all else
fails, in New South Wales, a farmer who has refused to comply with control
measures could have the farm compulsorily de-stocked.''
One advantage is that ``clean'' areas become an attraction for for buyers who
are keen to obtain disease-free stock. Prices rise accordingly.
``If we go on as at present sheep health will continue to decline with diseases
spreading and drug resistant parasites taking over,'' says Dr Coles. ``It need
not happen. We could have improving sheep health and some diseases eradicated.''
He suggests that the UK government would supply technical and legislative
support where necessary if they were asked strongly enough.
Dr Coles is prepared to embark on a nationwide tour of meetings of sheep
farmers to promote this approach,providing local vets and Members of Parliament
are also involved.
``It will cost money - but it will cost even more not to start new disease
control and eradication schemes,'' he said.

REFERRALS to the Employee Counselling Service have gone up by 50% this year,
but there has been no proportionate increase in donations from employers,
writes JOAN GRADY.
Last year employers were asked to consider matching their donations to the use
of the service. Despite this, the 1994 annual report shows only a 21% rise in
donations, and the prognosis for the future is not good.
``The demand for the counselling service has never been greater,'' says
treasurer Robert Stewart. ``The response to the employers' questionnaire
conducted in May indicates overwhelming satisfaction with the service, but we
are not receiving any more resources to ensure this high level of service can
continue.''
Strathclyde Regional Council is the service's biggest supporter, providing more
than half the funding necessary to keep it running.
Andrew Stewart of Strathclyde Regional Council has worked alongside ECS for
many years. He is in little doubt as to its usefulness.
``The main benefit of the service in that it's seen to be absolutely
confidential,'' he says. ``There is a clear division between employee and
workplace. Employees know they can get help there without it being referred
back to the boss.
``Initially people didn't believe it could help them, but that changed
dramatically with the help of some enlightened managers and shop stewards.
``Being able to demonstrate that it could and did help meant reaching people
earlier - before it was too late to save their jobs. You can't force people to
go, they have to want to.''
Stewart suspects that if finances do not improve and ECS is forced to charge
for its services, fewer employers will make use of them.
``Employers might turn away from it since they are getting free counselling
just now,'' she says. ``The service in Glasgow is exceptionally professional.
If it were lost it would affect a great many people.''

THE traditional silver tinsel holds a special significance for Findlay Clark at
Boclair Road, Milngavie, this Christmas. For it's the 25th anniversary of the
highly regarded garden centre - and they are celebrating their silver jubilee
in style, with the biggest, brightest, and best festive spectacle so far.
And that's no mean feat.
Over the years the centre has established a singular reputation with families
and shoppers as an essential part of Christmas - and many must wonder how the
centre could possibly improve on last year's offering.
``There will be customers, for example, who haven't seen our revamp,'' said
company buyer Alan Docherty. ``The main improvements took place in May, but we
are continually adding new bits. There is now a brand-new pet shop - three
times the size of our previous area and with numerous tropical fish,
guinea-pigs, rabbits, budgies, cockatiels, and finches - and we are constantly
enhancing the quality of all our displays.
``The centre continues to evolve and now, in the run-up to Christmas, we have
reached the peak of excellence - an excellence reflected in the quality and
scope of our festive displays.
``Customers will be hard put to find such a varied display of quality Christmas
trees, accessories, and gifts - from glassware to outdoor clothing and plants -
anywhere else in Scotland.''
Naturally Santa plays a starring role in the proceedings and children will be
enthralled by this year's fairy-tale setting for the traditional grotto.
Visitors to Santa have to walk through an enchanted forest of artificial
Christmas trees and past an animated display of Santa and his reindeer to reach
Sleeping Beauty's castle.
After walking up the drawbridge, children enter a magical snow-covered garden
beneath scores of twinkling lights before coming to the castle courtyard full
of houses, a magic fountain, and fruit stall. Sleeping Beauty slumbers in a
four-poster bed and a fairy-tale ending is assured in the throne room, with
some kind words from Santa and, all-important, a present from his bottomless
sack.
To return to the subject of Christmas trees, Findlay Clark has a massive
selection of artificial trees, both decorated and plain, from nine-inch
table-toppers to 10ft specimens suitable for the biggest of houses.
There are, among others, Canadian pines, ridge and Arkansas firs in blue,
green, and with snow effect.
Under cover outside, the ``real'' trees range from the needle drop-resistant
variety to the common-or-garden Norway spruce and ball-rooted specimens which
people can use, in increasing size, year after year.
``The trees are all grouped in size categories - from 3ft to 15ft in stock and
larger sizes to order - and each tree is individually labelled, giving its type
and size.
``All the trees on display are unwrapped so customers can come, take their
time, and buy the tree of their choice, which we then wrap in netting.
``We are now open from 9am till 7.30pm, seven days a week, so people can even
come after work when they don't have to worry about the rat race.''
Back in the warmth of the centre, you will be spoilt for choice when it comes
to decorating your tree.
There's a dazzling display of Christmas lights, both indoor and out. As well as
a basic set (#6.99 for 40) there are candle, winter crystal, and lantern-style
lights, and a string of illuminated Christmas houses is ideal for arranging
round doorways.
Then there are the increasingly sophisticated chaser lights with multi-mode
controllers which produce a variety of effects, the most expensive being a
kaleidoscope set at #46.
Baubles come in every colour under the winter sun - champagne pink and gold,
mauve, purple and blue - either plain or patterned so people are able to
decorate their tree to compliment existing decor.
The main sales floor is dotted with themed Christmas trees, each reflecting a
different mood - from a white tree draped in pearl-like strings of beads; a
kaleidoscope tree with gifts reminiscent of an Eastern bazaar; a rustic tree
laiden with berries and autumn fruits; and a mystical tree with signs of the
zodiac, moons and stars.
There are even trees to celebrate any family's new arrival, coloured, as you
might expect, in blue or pink. They can be found in the Kiddies' Corner which
is themed around a nursery, complete with a seasonal wallpaper border, a double
bed full of huge rabbits and teddies, and a wooden train made from half-barrels
filled with smaller soft toys.
If you're looking for a decoration that's a little bit different then Findlay
Clark has the answer: a Christmas-tree-like spiral which you decorate and hang
from the ceiling. Underneath is a wicker base which you can festoon in garlands
of tinsel.
The centre has everything you need for floral arranging, from ribbon to
polyester packs of holly and large golden-leaved apples - and therein lies the
secret of Findlay Clark's success.
``Most stores and supermarkets have got Christmas decorations but only a
limited selection. We go from the bottom to the top in terms of
sophistication,'' said Alan. ``In our colour-matched and themed displays we
also try to show people how particular items can be used.''
A new line this Christmas is a range of ceramic Snow Babies - complete with
houses and trees - which are very popular in the United States; and then there
is the Dickens village range of lit-up figures and houses which make ideal
table centre-pieces.
Round the corner a large animated Santa ornament is busy with his paintbrush,
and other moving figures read stories or play festive music.
Candles have always been a part of Christmas, and the growing popularity of
Scandinavian wooden candelabra is also reflected in an impressive display.
In the giftware section everything is just that little bit different, that
little bit special.
``Again we specifically aim to buy giftware that is not going to be readily
available in shops in the town.
``As well as our brassware there's a whole range of continental glassware,
rustic-style, as well as more traditional Caithness-style glass.
``There's a range of terracotta ware and all different styles of ceramics, and
we show how you can mix and match to suit your own particular environment.''
There are toiletries from Crabtree and Evelyn, napkins for Christmas parties,
shortbread and biscuits, right through to gourmet foodstuffs. Fresh whole
apricots, whole cherries in syrup, and fresh pears in wine are all avilable
from the preserves stand.
As you might expect, house plants are a big seller.
``You can buy everything from a bottle garden plant from one inch high right up
to six-inch specimens. We have got palm trees, weeping figs, and all sorts of
hanging plants, both flowering and foliage.
``We have a big range of orchids, which are becoming more and more popular as
Christmas presents, because the prices have become quite reasonable.''
The poinsettias are very eye-catching, particularly the bi-coloured variety in
creamy yellow with a pink centre. Mini-clerodendrons in flower and cyclamen -
from the small variety to the large flower-covered hybrid - are other
attractive gift ideas.
``Large plants make nice presents, particularly the foliage plants which can be
quite unusual. People appreciate them because they can enjoy them all year
round.
``Air plants - arranged, for example, around ceramic figures and animals - are
popular too because they take no looking after. We also sell bits and pieces
for making your own arrangements.
``Then there are the traditional terrariums and new ones from the continent
with mirrors behind them.''
The centre also specialises in bonsai trees - ready arranged and in kits,
complete with tools, scissors, and instructions.
And just because winter awaits doesn't mean the garden has to be bare. ``We
have a range of outdoor plant arrangements which you can still use to brighten
up the patio at Christmas. There is a range of figs, ivys, conifers, and
winter-flowering plants; jasmin and camellia, which is ideal for an unheated
conservatory and which flowers in January and February. There is a range of
winter-flowering shrubs, hollies, Christmas roses, and ornamental cabbages, all
displayed in containers for the patio.''
If you're looking for the ideal gift for the outdoor-type, you'll be spoilt for
choice in the Stirlingshire Saddlery, which stocks a huge range of outdoor
clothing, hats, and footwear alongside the saddles and bridleware.
But before you return to your car in the centre's massive free car park you can
relax in the Egon Ronay-recommended Famous Coffee House with a light meal,
snack, coffee and cake, or even Nardini ice cream.
Oh, and don't forget that wrapping paper - and the bows and ribbons and
ornamental filigree . . .

THE struggle to secure the financial survival of Scotland's hill farmers in the
north and west is set to continue, according to John Ross, the president of the
NFU.
Clearly disappointed at the Government's decision on Tuesday to do no more than
hold the current levels of HLCAs, Mr Ross has now indicated that further
pressure will be applied on the Scottish Office in the union's efforts to
consider the special needs of the Highlands.
Last year no less than #40.8m came to Scotland's 13,500 hill farmers, but Mr
Ross reckons that this is insufficient to cope with the special needs of some
extremely disadvantaged areas.
In early October the NFU met a large number of hill farmers in Fort William who
recounted their difficulties. Mr Ross was clearly impressed with their
arguments for higher subsidies. Commenting on that submission yesterday he
said: ``We're not talking about inches of rain - we're talking about nine feet
and lambing figures frequently no more than 55%. Agriculture in these areas is
on the knife edge.''
The Scottish Office agriculture team headed by the Minister, Lord Lindsay, are
fully aware of these problems but sources claim that to hold the line in a time
of cuts in public expenditure should be viewed as being positive rather than
negative. Meanwhile the UK farming unions are quietly - and very much off the
record - congratulating themselves in a similar vein.
In Scotland the argument for increased HLCAs has not been helped by the record
statistics revolving around the annual sales of Blackface rams. At the
principle sales just short of 6000 rams grossed #3.7m while a 44 rams sold at
#10,000 each or more. The top bid of #50,000 came at Lanark last month for a
six-months-old ram lamb, while all those rams averaged no less than #611. That
figure has been widely taken to suggest that the pleas of poverty are more
localised than general.
Efforts to highlight the special difficulties of the remote areas will continue
and the NFU is sure to stress that these will increase if the new proposed EU
Transport Regulations are implemented in their draft form. Feed costs are also
on the increase. The official Government line will reveal early in the new year
that hill farming incomes for 1995 have risen by just over 10%.

HYUNDAI owes its start as a car manufacturer, rather than just an assembler, to
George Turnbull. Later given a knighthood, when he was running the Inchcape
group, Turnbull played an important part in many major motor industry
operations.
In the early Seventies he was effectively second in command to Donald Stokes at
British Leyland, having charge of Austin Morris, as well as of the truck and
bus divisions. At that time, as is now well known, BL was a very unhappy ship.
When Turnbull resigned, he was immediately head-hunted by Hyundai.
The South Korean conglomerate was already assembling Ford Cortinas under
licence, but had ambitions to develop as a full-scale manufacturer of its own
vehicle products. Turnbull was exactly the man for the job. Taking charge in
1972, he masterminded a mammoth project in which - by literally moving a
mountain - one of the biggest car factories in the world was created on the
Korean coast at Ulsan.
The timescale of this project was staggering. A mock-up of the Hyundai Pony,
Korea's first home-designed car, was exhibited at the Turin Show in 1974, and
production began the following year. By 1977 Turnbull wanted to move back to
Britain. Following the Ryder report on the UK motor industry, the Government
asked him to return to take the reins at British Leyland. But the two sides
could not agree terms, and the job went to Michael Edwardes instead.
Turnbull then moved to Iran to run the Paykan operation which assembled Hillman
Hunters under licence. With the fall of the Shah, there was no point in staying.
This time he did come home, to head Peugeot Talbot Ltd, which took over the
former Chrysler business in the UK. He ran that from 1979 to 1984, having more
than his fair share of problems with the Linwood factory, which he finally
closed. His last move was from Peugeot Talbot to Inchcape, where he was working
at the time of his death.
As his surname suggests, George Turnbull was Scots-bred and played rugby as a
young man for London Scottish. In later years he had regular holidays near
Aberfoyle, often in company with Brian Llewelyn, currently Peugeot Talbot's
public relations director.
Llewelyn remembers him not only as a keen sportsman, but also as ``the best
man-manager I've ever worked with - a great motivator''.

IJAZ Ahmed bolstered Pakistan's flagging morale with an unbeaten century at the
Sydney Cricket Ground yesterday, guiding the tourists to 231 for four by the
close of play on the first day of the third and final Test.
Ijaz occupied the crease for six minutes short of six hours to finish on 101
not out, leading the Pakistan recovery after they had lost Aamir Sohail in the
first over with the score on four.
Shane Warne made a dramatic return to Test action, shrugging off the lingering
effects of a broken toe to claim the wickets of Ramiz Raja and Inzamam-ul-Haq
in his 27 overs.
But the day belonged to Ijaz, who reached his third Test century - all made
against Australia - cutting a short ball from Craig McDermott to the point
boundary just before close.
Ramiz fell for 33 before lunch when he lofted a simple catch to Michael Slater
at mid-on. Warne struck again in his third spell when Inzamam was caught by
wicketkeeper Ian Healy off a bottom edge with his score on 39.
McDermott had made the first breakthrough, with Sohail edging a catch to Mark
Waugh at second slip off the third ball of the innings.
Fast bowler Glenn McGrath took the fourth wicket, removing Salim Malik for 36,
his highest score in four innings on tour, during the final session.
Malik, whose tour has been overshadowed by a bribery scandal and disrupted by
injury, was jeered by a small first-day crowd of 11,000 as he walked to the
wicket. Scoreboard:

SCOTTISH Investment Trust, which holds a broad-based international portfolio,
easily beat its benchmark index in the year to October 31.
The independent Edinburgh-based trust with total assets of #909.9m saw net
asset value per share rise 12.4% to 281.4p.
That was well ahead of its benchmark, the FT/S&amp;P Actuaries World Index, which
rose by 9.2%.
Fund manager Ian McLeish said strong performances in UK and US equity markets,
the appreciation of bond holdings, some special one-off dividends and a 27%
increase in the trust's unlisted portfolio all helped to achieve a record
performance.
The only drag on overall performance came from emerging markets hit by the
aftermath of the Mexican financial crisis, but they only account for 12.7% of
SIT's equities assets.
``The markets in the Far East really didn't do a great deal over the last
year,'' Mr McLeish said, ``But our view is that these areas will come around
again - they're very high-growth areas.'' With that philosophy in mind, the
trust chose to increase its investment in emerging markets by #19.5m in the
year to October.
Mr McLeish said this constituted only a small part of the overall #78.8m
increase in holdings of quoted equities during the year.
The increase was partly funded by #44.3m generated from the conversion of
warrants into trust shares in February.

MELROSE, approaching their fifth Scottish club title in seven years, have
recalled Kevin Allan and Andrew Kerr to their pack for the Tennents Premiership
match against Gala at the Greenyards tomorrow.
Allan, after injury, returns at tight head whereas Kerr, making his first
appearance of the season, will be at open-side wing forward. Not only is Kerr
an expert at winning ball on the ground but his return creates the former
champions' probably best balanced back-row blend, with Isaac Feaunati switching
to No.8. Doddie Weir moves to lock.
Gala, who scored a rare championship win over Hawick last week, field an
unchanged team for their last blast at the top level before they slip down into
Division 2.
Melrose control the race for the title. Not only are they in front but they
also have a points differential superior to any of those of the three other
contenders. Boroughmuir are one point behind whereas Watsonians and Stirling
County are two adrift. But County, the defending champions, have a game in hand.
Boroughmuir and Stirling meet at Bridgehaugh tomorrow, but neither has defined
a team. Stirling have added Angus Turner, Murray Fraser, Jim Brough, and John
Gibson to the 15 who played last week against Melrose at Bridgehaugh. If Fraser
were to play it would be his first senior club match since he was ordered off
against Heriot's nine weeks ago.
Jamie Mayer, a schools cap, has a game at centre for Watsonians against Hawick
at Myreside, allowing Andrew Garry to switch to stand-off in place of the
injured Duncan Hodge.
Ayrshire's two premiership clubs each take the opportunity of a break from
competitive club rugby to introduce a newcomer. Graeme Ferguson, a full back in
Glasgow's squad preparing for the under-19 district championship, will be at
stand-off for Ayr on their visit to Peebles, whereas Kilmarnock call on Andrew
McMurray, the former Watsonian prop, for their match at Grangemouth.
Stewart's Melville give debuts to Adrian Service and David Pickering against
Ballymena at Eaton Park. Service, however, is no stranger to Eaton Park as he
hails from Ballymena.
q.GLASGOW make five personnel changes to the side which defeated Griqualand
West 21-7 for their opening inter-district championship match against North and
Midlands at Beveridge Park, Kirkcaldy, on Wednesday, with Ian Jardine, Kenny
Logan, Cammy Little, Guy Perrett, and Iain Sinclair come into the side.
Four capped players - Kevin McKenzie, Shade Munro, Alan Watt, and Derek Stark -
could not be considered because of injury. Team:
C Sangster (Stirling County); T Mathewson (Glasgow Academicals), I Jardine
(Stirling County), A Garry (Watsonians), K Logan (Stirling County); C MacGregor
(Glasgow Academicals), C Little (GHK); J Gibson (Stirling County), G Bulloch
(West of Scotland), G McIlwham (GHK) M Norval (Stirling County), G Perrett
(West of Scotland), F Wallace (Boroughmuir) M Wallace (GHK) I Sinclair
(Watsonians). Replacements - C Simmers (Edinburgh Academicals), J McLeod (GHK),
F Stott (West of Scotland), M Begley, G Doran (both Glasgow Academicals), C
Docherty (GHK).
q.GLASGOW, beaten 22-13 by South last week, have made nine changes for the
under-18 district match against Edinburgh at Haddington tomorrow.
Jamie Millan has been called up at stand-off in a recast back division in which
only Fraser Kennedy remains where he was last week, and Gordon Sykes has been
introduced at tight head. Team:
S McAllister (Stirling County); A Hutchinson (Cambuslang), C Smith (Ayr), S
Kidd (Kilmarnock), A Pollock (Glasgow Southern); J Millan (GHK), F Kennedy
(Stirling County); L Haycock (Mid-Argyll), A Smith (Stirling County), G Sykes
(Ayr), S Bryce (Dalziel), J Toner (Allan Glen's), B Allan (Hamilton
Academicals), A Lees (Ayr, captain), D Wilson (GHK). Replacements - N Craig
(West of Scotland), S Weston (Hillhead/Jordanhill), M Dick (Cambuslang), J
Maclay (GHK), T McCulloch (Stirling County), J Mundell (Cartha Queen's Park), J
Crump (Dumfries).

<TEXT>
n KOREAN car companies regularly predict that they will be in the motor
industry world-wide top ten by the turn of the century.
Some observers regard this as fairly unlikely, since there are still many
Korean cars which lean heavily on old-fashioned or borrowed technology and
styling. That is really no surprise, considering that most of the Korean
manufacturers drifted into motor manufacturing sideways.
There are examples in the Scottish motor trade of businesses which began as
one-man operations developing into networks with dozens of branches. But
Hyundai Motor Company, the Korean industry leader, puts things into perspective.
It was founded in 1940 as a small-vehicle repair shop, and is now part of
Korea's largest business conglomerate, Hyundai Business Group. There are
170,000 employees world-wide, and annual sales exceeding #45 billion.
Kia was originally a precision engineering company, while SsangYong opened for
business in 1939, making handicrafts. Then it transformed itself into another
conglomerate with interests in cement, oil refining and, latterly, vehicle
manufacture.
Daewoo, which is currently pioneering the direct marketing of cars in Britain,
was founded in 1967 as an exporter of clothing and textiles. Now the Daewoo
Group, with interests as varied as hotels and space technology, is in the weird
situation of including two quite separate car-building enterprises . . .
Daewoo Motor is the obvious one, but points in a motor-club quiz might be won
by somebody who knew that the other - working with assistance from Suzuki - is
Daewoo Shipbuilding!

CAR parts replacement giant Kwik-Fit is set to expand with its #12m cash
purchase of Birmingham-based Tyre Sales, the largest tyre and automotive repair
company in the Midlands region.
The newly-acquired subsidiary's 43 retail centres and 40,000 square foot
wholesale warehouse will continue to operate under the Tyre Sales logo.
In the year to November 30, 1994, the company produced pre-tax profits of
#200,000 on a turnover of #21.1m.
Tyre Sales' net assets at that date amounted to #2.2m, and net assets are not
expected to be lower than that figure when the acquisition is completed.
In the 11 months to October 1995, management accounts showed the Midlands
company's sales to be in line with the previous year. Profit for the same
period, before interest and directors' pay, amounted to #900,000.
A Kwik-Fit spokesman said the purchase of Tyre Sales would help increase
Kwik-Fit's representation in the Midlands, an area into which the company has
wanted to expand.
``There aren't too many regional chains of this size around, so Kwik-Fit was
quite pleased when this one came available and they were able to acquire it,''
he said.
He added that although there were no specific plans concerning future
purchases, he thought Kwik-Fit would ``certainly be interested'' if any more
Midlands automotive companies became available.
Over the medium to long-term, Kwik-Fit will be looking for improvement in Tyre
Sales' operating performance, the spokesman said. This will be done through
more effective marketing and employee training.
``There is a Kwik-Fit way of doing things and I'm sure the incoming management
will want to show the employees how Kwik-Fit operates,'' the spokesman said.
Kwik-Fit, Europe's largest independent car parts replacement company, will
operate out of 779 specialist fitting centres after the Tyre Sales purchase is
complete.

WHEN it comes to offering opinions on cars from the countries usually lumped
together as the Pacific Rim, many observers reckon that the cheaper models are
the ones to go for. They often reckon there's no point in paying extra for
top-line versions which simply do not justify the additional cost. That trend
of thought may have hit the buffers, thanks to the new Hyundai Lantra.
Driving a 1.6-litre saloon before its bigger-brother 1.8, I felt the first car
was smooth and nimble enough. But the extra 200cc of the new 1.8-litre Beta
engine - the second in the series of Hyundai's own self-designed power units -
seemed a bigger step up in performance and response than the modest increase in
capacity implied.
On a hilly coastal route, the well-equipped 1.8 Lantra really stormed away,
thanks partly to the fine power-to-weight ratio produced by its 125bhp engine,
in a bodyshell lighter than several of its European rivals.
But there was a good torque spread too, as well as more accurate steering than
many Korean cars provide, plus quite sporting handling and a four-square
stability on the road.
Using multi-curved body panels with nothing in the way of ornamentation or
external clutter, the new Lantra looks well in the metal and is a much more
stylish car than the smaller Accent. Trim levels and interior layout are
attractive and businesslike, but, whereas the ugly-duckling Accent has
excellent passenger space for its class, the Lantra scores fewer points for its
rear-seat accommodation.
One stretch of unusually bumpy road produced an odd effect in several of the
test fleet cars. A curious chittering noise was eventually traced to the glass
sunroof vibrating. However, the effect was never heard on normal tarmac.
Hyundai is trying hard to create a new image for itself with the latest Lantra,
and its marketing in this country is about to become much more forceful.
While the appearance of the car is a match for most of its class competitors,
and the performance package, especially with the 1.8-litre engine, no longer
lags behind, the company's big advantage remains in its pricing structure.
The Lantra is a well-finished and well-presented car, with the entry level 1.6
LSi very competitively priced at #9999.
The better equipped 1.6 GLSi costs #11,499, the 1.8 Si comes in at #12,299, but
the version which goes against the old take-the-cheapest theory is the 1.8 CD.
This model costs #13,749 inclusive of air-conditioning and anti-lock brakes,
which are #1869 optional extras on other models. It looks and drives like
unusually good value for money.

<HEADLINE>Names of dead used by loan swindler</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975110191</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LOAN firm executive arranged false loans using the names of dead people.
Douglas Paterson, 45, took out a total of 17 false loans using the names of
former customers and the deceased in a fraud lasting almost six years.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday Paterson, of Craiglockhart Terrace,
Edinburgh, admitted acting with others to defraud the firm he worked for, Wagon
Finance Ltd, of #383,700 between 1986 and 1992.
He was caught out when the firm sent letters to customers direct from its
Middlesex head office and received queries.
A woman whose husband had died before he had supposedly got a loan and a man
who had paid off his loan and was surprised to learn he had taken out another,
both complained.
Depute-fiscal Jacqueline Currie said that the fraud began when Paterson was
manager of the firm's Inverness branch.
Two large loans had gone bad and there was no prospect of getting the money
back, so Paterson started making the bogus loan applications to get money to
pay back the bad debt.
As well as paying for the original bad loans, he was servicing the bogus loans
and he had to make more false applications to pay for them.
Until about 1990, Paterson just used the false loans to pay off other false
loans but he then started taking money from the account for himself.
Miss Currie said that although the total amount of the false loans was #383,700
many of the loans were paid off with interest and profit and the loss to Wagon
Finance amounted to #150,291.
Paterson and another employee in the Inverness office were sacked when the
fraud was discovered in 1992.
Defence solicitor Eric Scott said that Paterson had settled with the firm by
paying it all his assets.
Sheriff John Horsburgh, QC, deferred sentence for background reports until
December 20 and allowed Paterson bail.

THE valedictory presentation to the City by Grand Metropolitan's Lord Sheppard
was greeted with considerably more enthusiasm than most he has given since he
became chairman in 1987.
Market reaction to the 3.5% decline in pre-tax profits to #912m, ignoring last
time's #291m of exceptional reorganisation costs, was to push the shares
marginally ahead to 442p, with sentiment encouraged by the evidence that the
Pillsbury reorganisations are now taking effect.
Other changes are further back up the line but even so, cost savings in the
year to September amounted to #83m and more than enough to offset the #71m blow
from the loss of the distributorships for Absolut vodka and Grand Marnier
liqueur.
Lord Sheppard, who is being succeeded by George Bull, happily pointed out how
he had sold the Intercontinental Hotels at the peak of the market and quit the
milk industry before the deregulation chaos, while also making excellent
purchases such as Hublein and Pillsbury, which brought in the Burger King
franchise operation.
The most worriesome aspect is the dullish performance in IDV, where Europe was
disappointing. Overall spirits volumes rose just 2%, with the top five brands
led by Smirnoff, ahead by 4%.
Although GrandMet has over a dozen of the world's 100 top-selling spirits, it
needs one or two additional very high case volume brands on the lines of
Baileys, with both Smirnoff and J&amp;B scotch showing negligible improvements. But
Scotch does not seem able to excite the young drinker in most markets and who
look for alternatives including American whiskies and the newer spirits such as
tequila.
Pricing remains under pressure and although Mr Bull is hoping for a 2% rise
this year as are his competitors, that will require hard pounding.
Burger King operating profits were marginally ahead at #166m on a 7% rise in
turnover to #5230m. An additional 657 restaurants were added to the chain to
bring the total to 8030 and with claims that it is the best performing
hamburger chain in the US as regards growth. However, there was a reduction in
refranchising profits of #34m and that trend will continue.
The more mundane Pillsbury foods put in highly respectable figures from its
flour-based products, Green Giant and from its Haagen Dazs ice-cream, although
there is the threat that me-too products will slice away future growth.
GrandMet is spending vastly on advertising, with the budget last year leaping
19.7% to #1079m. Fortunately, it does have the cash flow to support this.
The dividend total has been raised 6.8% to 14.9p with a 9.4p final.

FUTURE pricing policy for milk will mean that altering the balance between fat
and protein will become increasingly important for farmers wishing to stay in
profit, says David Roberts, senior dairy specialist with the Scottish
Agricultural College.
His view is that keeping milk fat levels down will be a vital aim. Research at
SAC has shown that there are many ways to reduce fat percentage while
maintaining milk yield and protein content.
``Our experience is that there is no quick fix for increasing milk protein
content,'' he said.
``Certainly there is no need to invest in expensive feeding equipment to
achieve these increases. Modest but worthwhile increases of up to 0.2% can be
achieved easily by changing the diet.''
Longer terms or larger increases need a combination of factors.
Results from SAC's Acrehead Unit show consistent year on year increases in milk
protein content by paying attention to feeding the dry cow, changing the
composition of a concentrate and by improving silage quality.

EDINBURGH-based Miller Group, one of the largest privately-owned housing,
construction and development companies in Scotland, officially opened its
Glasgow office at 35 Baird Street yesterday.
Miller Group chief executive Keith Miller said the new office would give the
group a focused area from which to run its various business interests in the
west of Scotland.
The group provides a full range of construction services covered by the five
main areas of civil engineering, construction, developments, homes and mining.
``Miller Group developments can be found throughout the west coast of
Scotland,'' Mr Miller said. ``With our strong ties in this area, we firmly
believe that now is the ideal time for the company to consolidate its business
ventures by launching a new office in Glasgow.''
The #13m refurbishment of Celtic Park, the upgrading of the M74 and the M8, and
housing developments in Paisley, Bearsden, East Kilbride and Newton Mearns
represent some of Miller's western Scottish interests.
CBI Scotland director Iain McMillan, who performed the opening ceremony, said
the Miller Group was an excellent example of the kind of company the CBI wants
to encourage: a stable, steady-growth business with effective management and a
commitment to organised development.

THE Herald, I fear, ``carries too much fat - which at the end of the day means
we all pay more than we have to''. How about giving the ``redneck'' George
Birrell (November 25) a taste of the non-``eunuch'' discipline that he
recommends so freely for other so-called incompetents, ``eviction by the
rampant forces of capitalism''?
In a previous incarnation in a soi-disant ``Scottish'' tabloid I believe he
proved to be mathematically challenged. Now in The Herald he has shown himself
to be stylistically, orthographically, and grammatically challenged.
I presume the ``grey-haired grannies eeking out an existence in sub-post
offices in Highland villages'' were squealing at his appearance on the opposite
side of the counter. ``Irresistable'' is proof of lax spelling, while he must
think that ``siren message'' implies a warning hooter, not a mythological
reference of quite a different meaning.
I refrain from mentioning the many other inelegances and infelicities but
merely suggest that he should pay back part of his fee for every such mistake,
or better still be shown the door for incompetence.

THE Herald is an important publication in shaping public opinion, so it is
disappointing that your article of November 30 on the Hamilton postal strike
did not give the full picture. What was missing was Royal Mail's side of the
story.
Unfortunately, the lengthy story also contained inaccuracies which, in order to
give the readers the full picture, have to be addressed.
First it was stated that Royal Mail last year made a profit of #1500m. Not so.
The pre-tax profit for the last financial year was #302m.
The profit strategies of the Post Office Group, of which Royal Mail is part,
are driven by the need to meet Treasury cash targets. In the last financial
year the group had to pay to Treasury coffers more than #200m - and this was
before we had to pay a further #110m in Corporation Tax.
Readers may be interested to know that, over the past decade, the Post Office
Group has paid to Government some #1250m at today's prices.
Second, the story refers to alleged cutting back on second-delivery mail. Let's
be crystal clear: Royal Mail has not cut second deliveries to a single
customer. Second deliveries are important to us and they are important to
customers.
The reality is that we are now getting much more mail through in time for first
delivery and we need to change so that we have enough staff to carry out these
first deliveries while not being overstaffed for the much lighter load of
second deliveries. All we are doing is changing the mix of staffing. There is
absolutely no threat to second deliveries.
The key driver for the changes we are seeking is ensuring that our customers
receive their mail when it is ready. The only counter suggestion that we have
received to our proposals is to hold back mail which is ready for first
delivery in order to justify the overstaffing on second deliveries. That's
unacceptable to us and to our customers.
Third, there was an allegation that the changes were are seeking are ``just
about saving money''. Not true. They are driven by the need to meet customers'
rising expectations and by the fact that we must keep pace with competitors.
The reported massive rise in business for courier and fax companies over the
past week testifies to this.
The best way to secure long-term job security is to exceed customer
expectations and to beat the competition. We need to change to ensure we remain
successful as a business which provides a nationwide service at a universal
price.
Fourth, the article referred to a trend towards casualisation. With change on
the horizon our strategy has been to employ staff on a temporary basis over and
above our permanent staff to ensure that our core of permanent employees is
protected. This has been successful and, indeed, since June we have been able
to offer permanent jobs to 800 temporary staff.

By KEN GALLACHER
DUNDEE Football Club are in new, but familiar, hands this morning after the
Canadian millionaire Ron Dixon, owner of the Dens Park team for close to five
years, finally relinquished control as forecast in The Herald 24 hours earlier.
The departing Dixon forecast that manager Jim Duffy could become the chairman
of the Tayside club in the future. Said Dixon: ``I hope that Jim Duffy would
eventually become chairman of the club when the other people involved may
decide to move out.''
Dixon, of course, has never hidden his admiration for the player-manager who
carried Dundee into the Coca-Cola Cup final against Aberdeen just last Sunday.
And yesterday it emerged that Duffy and his vice-chairman Malcolm Reid were
involved in the #3m buy-out of the club with financial backing from two local
businessmen.
The earlier indications had been that the Vancouver-based Dixon wanted #2.2m
for the club but hoped to retain the stadium itself. That was always going to
be a major problem in any deal but the one announced yesterday had Dens Park
being transferred to the new consortium along with the football club.
Said Dixon: ``I have had offers for the club before but I did not feel it was
appropriate to sell to the earlier bidders. This is a deal which is right for
this club.''
Dixon arrived back unexpectedly in Scotland to attend the final last Sunday
and, almost immediately, he was setting the wheel in motion to sell. After a
lengthy and mysterious absence from Dundee, he explained he was looking after
more pressing business interests in other parts of the world and talked of the
possibility of a merger between his club and their local rivals Dundee United.
Yesterday that kind of talk was forgotten as the deal         for new ownership
was announced at Dens Park.
Dixon maintained: ``This sale was at my initiative. The club is going to go on
and get stronger. It was on the verge of being closed down when I took over.
Now there are no debts and the new men in charge are the right people to take
things forward.
``Malcolm Reid has learned a lot about running the club in the last few years
and he will be chairman now, but eventually I believe Jim Duffy will take on
that role. He and Jimmy Nicholl are the two best coaches in the country and Jim
teaches young men how to lead their lives as well as play football.
``I am happy to leave these men in charge . . .''
Said life-long Dundee supporter Reid, the new chairman: ``People should
appreciate just what Ron Dixon has done for this club. Now I hope that the
locals will get behind us when they see what we are trying to achieve here.''
The first-division club have known troubled times but now the uncertainty
appears to have gone. Reid is respected in the city, and Duffy after his recent
cup run, and the promotion possibility which exists for the club is revered.
The #3m buying price - Dixon bought the club for just #600,000 and then gave a
peronal loan of #1.5m to clear outstanding debts - is due to be paid over a
five-year period.
q DUNDEE United front players Andy McLaren and Robbie Winters have accepted new
contracts with the Tannadice club.
Manager Billy Kirkwood has spent most of the season adding big-money buys to
the United staff in a bid to return to the premier division. But he said last
night: ``These two young players have loads of potential and securing them on
longer contracts is every bit as important as spending vast amounts in the
transfer market.''

EGYPT Mill Prince looks the one to be on in the Crowngap Construction Handicap
Chase at Sandown today.
He has often been the supporting act in big races, none more so than in the
Mackeson Gold Cup in which he has been placed in each of the last three seasons.
It looked as though he had stolen the show when he jumped into the lead at the
last in the Cheltenham feature this term, only for Dublin Flyer to head him in
a stirring finish.
That was a fine effort from Egypt Mill Prince against a horse who goes into the
King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day with a leading chance.
Flyer's Nap can pass his big-race audition in the P &amp; O Handicap Chase. Robert
Alner will have the Welsh National at Chepstow on December 27 in mind for the
gelding who gave the trainer the biggest win of his career in the Fulke Walwyn
Kim Muir Chase at the Cheltenham Festival last March.

A MAN who was committed to the State Hospital at Carstairs without limit of
time more than 20 years ago after being charged with murder has absconded from
a Paisley hospital.
Robert Moor, 52, from Barrhead was transferred to Dykebar Hospital from
Carstairs to continue his rehabilitation in 1993. He was acquitted of murder in
1971.
Charge dropped
FOOTBALLER John Fashanu is not being charged with attempting to pervert the
course of justice, police said last night. A case alleging match rigging with
goalkeepers Bruce Grobbelaar and Hans Segers, and Malay businessman Heng Suan
Lim, is due for a second remand hearing in Southampton today.

A LECTURER in food safety is preparing a formal complaint to the European Union
over alleged breaches of drinking water regulations involving sheep dip
pesticides on the island of Arran.
Dr Lewis Routledge claims that tests for sheep dip residues by Strathclyde
Regional Council's water department have taken place mainly outwith the dipping
season.
He fears that watercourses have been contaminated - and wants urgent action to
guarantee that water quality standards are maintained.
A Strathclyde spokesman yesterday said Mr Routledge was ``creating an
unnecessary scare on the island,'' and insisted:
q Water quality, both chemically and biologically, has received top grade Class
1 categories by the Clyde River Purification Board in tests since his
complaints.
q No sheep dipping takes place in Arran's water catchment areas, and monitoring
on the island meets the Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations of
1990.
But Mr Routledge is adamant that, when holidaying on Arran in July, he was told
by a bailiff that it was ``common practice'' for unused sheep dip to be
disposed of by tipping into rivers in spate.
Mr Routledge has already won an EU victory over water quality south of the
Border, and said yesterday: ``I am quite prepared to make a formal complaint to
the EU about Strathclyde.''
He is a food science lecturer at Newcastle College of Higher Education, and his
specialist subject is water pollution.
That interest is now combined with a personal campaign for the safe disposal of
sheep dip chemicals after his twin sons suffered paralysis from contamination
from stored sheep dip south of the Border. Both have since recovered.
Mr Routledge's allegations of breaches in quality standards on Arran have led
to meetings by islanders over complaints about discoloured drinking water.
Their fears were allayed by numerous officials who attended a public meeting
earlier this week.
However, Mr Routledge claims that, over the past three years, four out of five
Strathclyde tests on Arran for sheep dip pesticides were made outwith the
dipping months of August, September and October.
He will complain to the Scottish Office as a first step towards a European
order, boosted by an earlier EU victory against the predecessors of Northumbria
Water over problems with Newcastle water supplies.
Mr Routledge also took heart from the National Centre for Toxic and Persistent
Substances' recent call for the disposal of sheep dip to be reviewed by
Government.
Mr Routledge said: ``I already have a second stage judgment against the UK
Government from the EU on the question of water quality, and this complaint
could be added to that. It could lead to a third stage judgment, which would
leave the Government liable for heavy fines.''
A Strathclyde water services' technical official said that random sampling on
Arran is set 12 months in advance. The programme tests typical samples of
water, as supplied to customers at different times of the year. Not one test
for sheep dip residues had failed.
He added that such results were expected, because all water intakes on the
island are above the level where sheep dipping takes place.
Strathclyde has approved plans for a #6m filtration system for Arran's holding
reservoirs.

IT was a classic standoff in the TV ratings war. A mischievous scheduling move
by ITV which put EastEnders and Coronation Street head-to-head against each
other on Christmas Day. Soap fans, or at least the ones without video
recorders, would have been faced with the unthinkable - which one would they
watch? Clearly, something had to give . . . and it was the BBC who blinked
first.
Yesterday BBC1 Controller Alan Yentob finally backed down and agreed to
rearrange his Christmas schedule, thereby averting a clash between the two top
programmes.
The scriptwriters for both series have pulled out all the stops to draw viewers
on one of the biggest viewing days of the year. EastEnders promised, not only
Arthur Fowler languishing in the pokey on Christmas Day, but also the shock
return of long-lost and left for dead Frank Butcher. Meanwhile, down Coronation
Street there would be a romantic cliffhanger involving Raquel the barmaid and
her ex, Curly.
When the BBC became aware of the clash earlier this week, Mr Yentob made a
late-night phone call to Marcus Plantin, his ITV counterpart, urging him to
reverse the last-minute decision which created the dilemma. But Plantin stood
firm, forcing an angry Yentob to juggle his schedule.
BBC chiefs accused ITV of manufacturing a situation which was against the
interests of the viewers. But Mr Plantin declared that he reserved the right to
indulge in a spot of ``tweaking'' in the light of other channels' decisions.
His schedule alterations were only made after the BBC revealed details of its
Christmas viewing on Wednesday. EastEnders would be shown in two halves; the
first at 6.30 when it would be up against an ITV special featuring Soldier,
Soldier stars, Jerome and Robson. Mr Yentob even spoke of a truce with ITV to
save soap fans from an agonising decision.
``We've reached an unofficial agreement - I've seen their schedules and they've
seen mine. It was in nobody's interests to pit the two shows against each
other,'' he said.
However, the words were no sooner out of his mouth than ITV rescheduled
Coronation Street for 6.30pm.
A BBC spokesman explained: ``We know from long experience that viewers resent a
manufactured clash of this kind. Once we saw ITV's change to their schedule
after we had announced ours, we had no alternative but to re-schedule our
Christmas in the best interest of the viewers.''
The BBC, which regularly wins the Christmas Day ratings battle, has now
shuffled its mid-evening programmes to slot in EastEnders at 7.30.
Head-to-head clashes between the two soaps are very rare. It happened once
before, when BBC1 introduced a third EastEnders episode in April last year.
ITV was unrepentant about its ruthless rescheduling, which it confirmed was a
response to the BBC's schedule launch.
q A long-awaited return by Inspector Morse gave ITV its biggest peak-time
viewing share this year, it was claimed yesterday. Unofficial overnight figures
showed 15.3 million people tuned in - 64% of the available television audience.

STAGECOACH, continues to motor ahead in the fast lane, with a constant eye on
the railways.
The UK's largest private bus operator boosted pre-tax profits by 43% to #20.7m
during the 24 weeks to October 14 and celebrated by raising the interim
dividend 27% to 2.1p.
This pleased the City, where Stagecoach shares rose 5p to 283p.
Ian Wild, a transport analyst with broker BZW, said the results were ``Bang in
line'' with expectations, despite a dip in operating profits on bus operations
in southern England.
Stagecoach passenger traffic rose by 1% during the half year, bucking a 0.5%
decline in UK bus traffic as a whole.
But the Perth-based company is turning its attention to trains and is bidding
for British Rail passenger service franchises as they arise.
Executive chairman Brian Souter shrugged off Stagecoach's failure to make the
shortlist for Great Western and London-Tilbury-Southend, two of the first three
train operating companies to be put on the market.
``We are going in with a very very wide net and I think we will get something
in the end,'' he said.
Stagecoach should hear by Christmas whether or not it has won the third
franchise for South West Trains, which operates services from London to
Southampton and Exeter.
But it also has four other bids in the pipeline, whose outcome should be known
within three months.
Stagecoach has teamed up with the management of Network South Central in London
to bid for both that franchise and the Gatwick Express operation.
It is also gunning for the Inter City East Coast Mainline service from London
to Edinburgh and Midland Mainline, which operates trains from London to
Sheffield.
Mr Souter expressed a firm intention to bid for Scotrail when it eventually
comes on the market, even though he does not regard it as the most attractive
train operating company available.
``We would intend to bid for Scotrail as well, but I would have to say that the
South of England franchises are more interesting,'' the Stagecoach chairman
said.
Mr Souter said a fall in the profitability of Stagecoach bus operations in
southern England over the last six months was mainly due to increasing economic
prosperity in the area.
Many staff were leaving Stagecoach for jobs elsewhere, forcing the company to
spend more on training new drivers, he said. The higher staff turnover also had
a disruptive effect on operations.
Mr Souter said other causes of the disappointing performance were the late
delivery of new buses and the exceptionally hot summer, which kept people off
sweaty crowded buses.
Turnover in southern England remained steady at #21m, but operating profits
there fell 15% to #3.3m.
Stagecoach remains on the lookout for opportunities to buy more bus companies
in the UK and continental Europe, following its venture into Portugal earlier
this year.
The company will take over operation of bus services linking Lisbon with its
western suburbs of Cascais and Sintra on January 1 and already has an eye on
the future privatisation of suburban railway services in that sector.
Mr Souter said the opportunities to buy bus companies in continental Europe
should increase with the approach of a 1999 deadline for all European Union bus
services to be put out to tender.
Stagecoach was also ``well positioned to get further growth in the UK market,''
Mr Souter said, even though it already runs claims to run 13% of the nation's
bus services.
He played down the impact of Stagecoach's repeated run-ins with the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission (MMC) over allegations of unfair competition and
predatory practises. Mr Souter said the second half of the current financial
year could see further acquisitions.
He expressed satisfaction that Derek Morris, a new face, was chairing the
current MMC inquiry into Stagecoach's purchase of Chesterfield Transport in the
north Midlands.

BRITAIN'S largest provider of venture capital, 3i, is well placed to track what
is going on in the British economy. As such, its interim results to September
30 reflect the UK's strong economic growth during the period. 3i increased its
total return on shareholders' funds by 13.5% to #277.3m, more than made in the
whole of 1994.
The interim dividend is raised by 10.7% to 3.1p. This is more than double the
rate of increase declared in the investment trust sector so far this year.
The group continues to see a string flow of investment opportunities both in
the UK and in continental Europe. Investments in Scotland were at a record
level, with over #30m of committed new investment, a rise of about #10m on last
year. 3i's Scottish portfolio now stands at 281 companies, with a value of
#269m.
Willie Watt, director of 3i Scotland, drew attention to some of its high level
investments such as DL Wholesalers, Walker Dickson and Clairemont Electronics.
In addition, he added that 3i was pleased to have committed over #13m in 15
emerging Scottish businesses such as Scotsafe and Deveron Environmental.
During the period, the company realised three significant investments. These
included the flotation of Meconic in June, with a valuation of over #40m. 3i
had a 25% stake.
Mr Watt said he expects to see continuing high levels of demand for investment
capital across the spectrum of deals from start-ups to large management
buy-outs. ``We remain committed to being at the forefront of investing in
independent businesses in Scotland'' he added.
In total, 3i invested #324.9m in the first six months of the year, including
#39.7m of third party co-investment funds. Its portfolio at the half-year
consisted of investments in around 3300 businesses with a combined valuation of
over #3200m.
On the revenue side there was a 28% gain in the surplus to #42.2m. Dividend
income from investments rose 30% on a year ago, reflecting higher profitability
of the portfolio. The value of 3i's UK equity portfolio rose 17.4%, ahead of
the FT All-Share index.
Commenting on the performance, chief executive Ewen McPherson said that while
some sectors experienced difficult trading conditions, the majority of the
portfolio continued to benefit from the relatively stable economic environment
and, for UK exporters, more favourable exchange rates.

OH dear, what a hard life Julie Davidson has, sitting wondering if she's going
to have to pay bank charges because her cheque hasn't arrived (November 24).
Those nasty, lazy, ``incompetent'' postmen just have no idea how they are
affecting the lives of the middle classes who fought so hard to keep them out
of the clutches of privatisation.
Ironically, privatisation might have given them wages and conditions more in
keeping with the last twentieth century than the Dickensian mode they are stuck
in at the moment. I mean can it get any worse than a six-day, 43-hour week
(every week) starting at 5.30am for a basic take-home pay of #140?
This is a hard job, especially in a Scottish winter - no early closures for
snow here! Try walking round in the rain for five hours with four bags of
shopping calling at 400 addresses, and you may have an inkling of how hard.
And remember, no mistakes, Julie Davidson is watching. You may have the secret
police watching too, or managers timing your every movement.
If you're off ill more than twice a year you can expect a warning letter. But
don't think you can air your grievances in a letter to the papers - you can't,
because you've signed the Official Secrets Act.
The postmen and women are not asking for much, just fairness. At the moment
they get the worst of all worlds, neither getting the good hours, conditions,
and holidays of other public servants, nor benefiting financially from the huge
increases in productivity they have achieved (there has been a 40% increase in
the volume of mail handled over the last 10 years).
Managers, trying to justify their own existence, are constantly bringing in
changes.
The Royal Mail has no competition in letter deliveries, it's the most efficient
in the world and it makes massive profits - #480m this year with over #200m
going straight to the government. So what are all these changes for? Profit
versus service.
Postmen and women are at the end of their tether, having been used and abused
for years. They are the infantry off whose backs the rest of the service makes
its living, yet they are treated like some kind of inferior beings.
Much as Julie Davidson hates the fact, the mail service is still a vital part
of the social and economic life of this country and the rest of society,
especially the poor, would miss it if it were to disappear, unlike the personal
musings of an overrated, overpaid, uninspiring feature writer.

FOLLOWING close upon the heels of Gavin Hastings, the book, comes Hastings, the
movie. Hastings' up-dated autobiography was published just a month ago and now
a 75-minute video entitled: ``Hero: The Gavin Hastings Story'' has been
launched.
The former Scottish captain, who retired with a record of 61 international
appearances and a Northern Hemisphere record tally 667 points, charts the
development of his career in the video which marks the first rugby personality
profile from the producers, Cameron-Williams.
Yesterday, executive producer John Williams said that pre-publication sales
mounted to around 20,000 and the target market was 150,000 copies: ``This is on
a par with some of the football videos that we've been involved in.
The video, written, produced, and narrated by Dougie Donnelly, features footage
of the Hastings' career and interviews with family, fellow players, and SRU
director of rugby Jim Telfer, who declares that Hastings was not only an
excellent player but an excellent ambassador for the game.
q.EDINBURGH Academicals have said that their meeting with the SRU over David
Sole's comments about referee Colin Henderson following their match against
Melrose had been ``amicable and constructive'' but because Sole could not be
there, the SRU secretary had been in touch with him to arrange an alternative
date for a meeting.
``However, David has a busy business and family life - catching up on the 10
years he gave almost exclusively to rugby - and there may be some difficulty
dove-tailing arrangements for a meeting,'' said the club.

DETA Hedman, the world No 2, was the only woman to survive a couple of rounds
in the qualifying competition of the Embassy World Professional Darts
Championship at Earls Court, London, last night. And then it was third time
unlucky.
Women are being allowed to play in this prestigious event for the first time,
and of the 11 in the draw, nine were beaten in two straight sets in their
opening matches, while Welsh internationalist Sandra Greatbach went down 2-1 to
Holland's Bert Vlaardingerbroek.
But Hedman, who lives in Witham, first beat Canadian Carl Mercer in straight
sets, and then defeated John Hook of Middlesex 2-0 in her second match. The
Essex girl, however, still had to win three more matches to be one of the eight
qualifiers who go through to the Embassy Championships at the Lakeside Country
Club, Frimley Green, in January.
Her fine run came to an end in her third match when she was beaten 2-0 by Gary
Spedding, the 27-year-old Cumbria County, player from Workington.

COMPANY donations to the Conservative Party have dropped, according to research
published today.
A survey found 172 companies gave #2,461,655 to the Tories in the year to March
1995, down from 198 traced as giving #2,836,600 the previous year.
It is the lowest number of companies and the smallest amount given for the last
five years not distorted by the General election, say researchers.
In 1990, the Tories' best non-election year, gifts of #3,815,071 from 309
companies were traced.
The survey appears in the December issue of Labour Research, published by the
independent trade union organisation the Labour Research Department, which
sifts the accounts of about 5000 UK firms each year for evidence of party
donations.
Firms must declare gifts of #200 or more if they produce an annual directors'
report.
Overall, the survey found about 50 companies which had stopped giving to the
Tories in the last 18 months.
They included United Biscuits, who had given an average of nearly #70,000 a
year for 15 years, the Rank Organisation leisure group, which gave a total of
#435,000 between 1979 and 1993, and insurance group Sedgwick, which had given
some #20,000 a year for 15 years.

SAM Torrance continued his golden year by taking a share of the lead at the Sun
City Million-Dollar Challenge with a three-under-par 69 yesterday.
Torrance, runner-up to fellow Scot Colin Montgomerie in the European Order of
Merit this year, sets the pace alongside US Open champion Corey Pavin.
The American made three birdies in the last four holes to climb up the
leaderboard while Torrance missed a short putt at the last to drop back into a
tie.
Montgomerie, whose three-foot putt on the final hole at Valderrama in October
consigned Torrance to second place on the European Order, was struggling at the
bottom of the 12-man field after a seven-over-par 79. He could not stop pushing
shots to the right as he went out in 40, and also found the greens treacherous.
Defending champion Nick Faldo shot a par 72. He was in touch with Torrance
until a            disastrous triple-bogey 8 at the long ninth. His fourth shot
hit the island green only to spin back into the water. He took three more to
get down and tumbled from three under par to level.
Torrance made the only eagle of the day at the same hole, sinking a 20ft putt
after a superb long-iron shot.
Unusually, heavy rain before the tournament toughened the rough to a level
normally associated with the US Open. With a gusting wind also troubling the
players, there was a premium on straight hitting.
But Pavin said he relished the tough conditions and lavishly praised the Sun
City layout.
``I am in awe of the way the course is set up,'' he said. ``The greens are
perfect .''
Zimbabwe's Nick Price, champion two years ago, bogeyed the last to join
American Tom Lehman at one under, while home favourite Ernie Els was with Faldo
and Bernhard Langer of Germany on level par.
Lehman underlined the difficulty of playing from off the fairway, saying: ``The
first cut of rough is okay but if you are beyond that, you're in big trouble.
If the wind remains, the tournament will be won by a pretty high score.''

IN the great days of the BMC Competitions Department, the Monte-winning entries
may have been Mini Coopers. But the tough and powerful sports cars which romped
over the mountain passes of the Alpine Rally, and hammered their way along the
Balkan goat tracks of events like the Spa-Sofia-Liege, were the Austin-Healeys.
BMC had a formidable team of drivers, especially in the Austin-Healey 3000s;
people like Donald Morley, Timo Makinen, Logan Morrison from Stirling, Paddy
Hopkirk and Pat Moss, who shattered the rally establishment by winning the
Liege-Rome-Liege outright.
Five Austin-Healey 3000s were built up for the works team in 1962, all with ARX
registration numbers. Through the years 37, 47, 57 and 77 ARX have all
disappeared, some cannibalised by the works mechanics to keep other Healeys in
fighting trim. The only one to survive, and in remarkably original condition,
is 67 ARX, now in the safe keeping of Tom Fitzsimmons. When the factory sold it
off in 1964, it was bought by long-time Austin-Healey enthusiast Ted Worswick,
and then passed to Syd Segal, who had a stable of ex-works Healeys, dismantled
67 ARX and never found the opportunity to bolt it all together again.
The next English owner, Nick Hill, put it back on the road, but not in the
spoiled ``super-restored'' condition in which many famous competition cars are
seen. He rebuilt it just as it had been in its heyday, still with the little
gadget behind the seats where the Morley twins kept their vacuum flasks, since
the original locations in the doors shattered them to bits.
In 1988 Victor Gauntlett, well known as part-owner of Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd,
bid #128,000 for 67 ARX at auction. He did some classic rallies with it, but
was equally careful to leave the car in original trim.
After a few years' ownership, Gauntlett in his turn put 67 ARX into an auction.
Prices had faded by that time, and it was not bid to anything like its reserve.
Tom Fitzsimmons came to a private arrangement with Gauntlett, and brought the
car to Scotland.
After a recent rebuild of the triple-Weber engine by yet another Healey
specialist, John Chatham, 67 ARX has probably had a power boost over the 210bhp
or so it produced during its works-team career. It may now be heading towards
240.
All the logbooks kept during the car's career are still with it. This is one
famous machine whose provenance cannot be doubted.
Tom Fitzsimmons is keener on racing than on rallying, and 67 ARX, as a genuine
classic competition car, has been invited to events at the Nurburgring and
Dijon, and the famous Coys weekend at Silverstone. But if an ex-works Healey
ever dreams, 67 ARX will drift back to the days when it was scrambling for time
over the dusty roads to Titograd, or powering up the hairpins of the Col de
Restefond.

IT is a fact of contemporary musical life in Scotland that we have high
expectations of the standards reached by our student ensembles. There was
little doubt that the Academy Chamber Orchestra would play with a high degree
of technical proficiency, confirmed last night in a relaxed reading of
Schubert's Overture in the Italian Style in D major.
The same composer's Unfinished Symphony posed a greater challenge. For the most
part the students rose to it, although they might have benefited from the
firmer control of a conductor here, rather than the direction of Leon Spierer
from the first violin chair. Both the quality of the ensemble sound and their
command of dynamics and rhythm were impressive, and if they did not always
succeed in turning the notes into fully expressive music-making, they did find
a lovely expansiveness at times.
Doubtless suitably encouraged by that success, they turned their attention to
Beethoven, opening the second half with a bold, energised performance of the
Prometheus Overture. Spierer led by example throughout, and they responded with
a sparkling account of the sunny, playful Symphony No 1, in which the finer
nuances of inner detail received scrupulous attention.
An occasional tentativeness aside, these were all confident performances which
required little allowance for the inexperience of the performers.

A man
of basic
instincts
Douglas Thompson talks to Michael Douglas, an actor who knows intimately the
excesses
of Hollywood living, about the breakdown of his marriage and the importance of
family ties
A haircut says it all about the generation gap. Cameron Douglas, son of
Michael, grandson of Kirk, aspiring actor and the new kid on this particular
family's Hollywood block, attended the glittering premier of his father's new
movie with an ever so closely cropped head.
Later his father, with his hair curling around the collar of his checked sports
jacket, was laughing as he said: ``When I was in my rebel stage I just wanted
my hair long. Now he can't get it short enough.
``It's all about growing up, and Cameron is into that difficult 15 to 16 to 17
period. I can still remember how complicated these years were. My parents were
divorced and that was hard to handle for me. Now Cameron has to deal with the
separation of myself and his mother.''
Michael Douglas and his dramatic looking wife - he met the then 19-year-old
Spanish-born Diandra Mornell Luker on the eve of Jimmy Carter's presidential
inauguration and they married eight weeks later in 1977 - split up this summer
amid ongoing reports of his serial philandering.
It had always been a tense marriage. He was 32 when they married and had been
around - he lived for five years with smokey voiced actress Brenda Vaccaro -
while his wife was a young student with no friends or family in America.
She had dropped out of her diplomacy studies in Washington and moved with her
husband to Los Angeles. He says now that was probably a mistake. Hollywood was
a tough town for a nave, sheltered, sweet-natured, newly-wed Senora. She
didn't fit in.
``She knew nobody, she felt she walked in my shadow, she had nothing to occupy
her while I buzzed around this wonderful, exciting life,'' says her now
estranged husband.
He adds: ``And I wasn't exactly the most understanding husband. A large part of
me believes in the work ethic, being the provider - it's in the genes, I guess.
I worked really hard to provide and I'm sure she still bitches about how hard I
work.
``And I have to agree that I didn't spend the appropriate time, enough time, at
home. I know how difficult it is for ladies who don't have a career, per se, in
terms of finding out who they are and their own identity.
``In other relationships in my life I've dealt with that. But I don't have a
lot of patience with it. I've always felt like I'm working hard, providing,
making a good home, a good life for everybody - which is not to be sneered at.
And if you're having identity problems, go get something to do.''
Sixteen years ago Diandra Douglas did just that. She got pregnant. Her aim was
to be the perfect wife and mother.
She complains now her husband made the job difficult: ``You can't have a
healthy family life with children when you're away 10 months of the year.
Cameron and I are such close friends because in a way we grew up together.''
The couple are living in separate homes. Cameron lives with his mother and is
attending a Californian high school. His father says the youngster wants to be
a radio DJ and then move on to film school.
However, he adds: ``Give the guy a break. I didn't start acting until I was 23.
Cameron's 16. I see my kid playing football now and he's struggling on a team
and he's got another year to go and he says: `Well, dad, I don't know if I'll
be playing a whole lot.' And I say: `Cameron you're playing, man. You're
playing a southern Californian high school football team. What do you want?' It
makes me proud. I used to play football and all of a sudden I see my son out
there.
``You want to nurture, but basically this is coming to me late. You just try to
hang out and you get a little shot of wisdom in there along the line.''
He himself was a youngster when his parents divorced. He went to live with his
mother, now Diana Darrid, in New York. She took him to California for a year
when he was 11. He recalls: ``I'd been to private school - blue blazer, flannel
shorts. Junior High in Los Angeles was a shock. It was a tough school. They had
killings. Kids carried knives. I remember the first girl I ever kissed there.
She had her mouth wide open. Yuk! I couldn't believe it. Nobody told me
anything about this!''
More of a shock was seeing his father make love on screen, most notably to Lana
Turner in The Bad and the Beautiful. ``I sneaked on to the set while they were
doing a love scene. That memory will stay with me always - boy, it was hot. But
my father was embarrassed about the whole thing.''
Cameron has seen his own father in action with Sharon Stone, Glenn Close, and
Demi Moore. ``He knows it's just movie-making. When he was younger he saw Fatal
Attraction at a friend's house. I wouldn't have wanted that but he dealt with
it. He's got a good heart and he knows about the movie business. Like me he's
been brought up in it. Come on, he wants to be part of it.''
Douglas is matter of fact about almost everything. In answer to reports that he
was treated for sex addiction he says he did go into the Sierra Tucson
rehabilitation centre in Arizona three years ago, but adds: ``There wasn't
anything to all that. I went to rehab for alcohol abuse. I had done Basic
Instinct and it got started. Sex addiction? I mean, I wish it was that simple.''
He says his problem resulted from 25 years of hard working and drinking,
``pressure and knocking it back''. He also had the pressure of a famous father
to deal with. As his son Cameron has today.
Cameron has watched his father's name - maybe infamy - rise following his Oscar
for Gordon Gekko, an eerie mirror of Kirk Douglas's best roles, in Wall Street
in 1987 and then the sex dramas Fatal Attraction, Basic Instinct and last
year's Disclosure.
``People hooked these pictures into my own private life. But a marriage is a
marriage. I celebrated 18 years of marriage. Over 50% of marriage in this
country ends in divorce.''
He leans forward in his chair in a Beverly Hills hotel suite. His knee is
jumping. He looks cool and healthy but he does fidget. He's anxious for a
Marlboro. You ask about the marriage surviving: ``Well, we have separate abodes
but we talk every day. And of course we have the common bond of Cameron. We
have a son we love a lot. I don't know......'' Then he laughs and adds: ``You
know, we get on better now we're apart than at some times during the marriage.''
He is remarkably philosophical about his situation. Cameron lives with his
mother - at one point this year his father was living with his mother who also
attended the gala screening for The American President. Douglas plays a widower
President with a teenage daughter. He is attracted by environmental lobbyist
Annette Bening (aka Mrs Warren Beatty) and in an election year publicly begins
to court her. Oval Office romance hurts him in the opinion polls. But he's in
love.
It is romantic comedy played by very politically correct rules by all concerned
- these are liberal, that is Democratic, film-makers and any comparison to
skirt chasing in the Clinton White House is just, they tell us, fiction.
Even the sex - especially for a Michael Douglas movie - is old fashioned Disney
one foot on the floor stuff. And the leading man is likeable not leering.
Douglas does laugh and smile a lot during an hour's talking.
He admits he walked in his father's shadow and had to prove himself to himself
and Hollywood - and to his father. ``That was exactly it for years.''
He's 51 now and says when he turned 50 he felt he had accomplished everything
he wanted. It's hard to accept when it's explained he has a dozen film projects
in the pipeline as actor and producer - he won an Oscar for producing One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest when he was 31.
But Spartacus and all those other giant roles his father played in turn played
with his brain: ``I wouldn't exactly say it was an inferiority complex. I think
early on as an actor or even before I started acting when I had a father to
follow who had 10,000 warriors or fleets of Viking ships...... there was a
larger than life persona.
``And you know my father, even in real life he has a dynamic quality about him
and so I figured early on: `My God, how can I ever be the man my father is?'
But what happens is you get your own career and your own sense of yourself and
your own work. You get to appreciate him much, much more.
``My father has been really supportive and has had a great time with my success
so we have never really competed. People ask that question and he always says
you don't understand.
``It's a sense of immortality to watch your son, and then your grandson gives
you a sense of immortality. As he's gone into his seventies it's become a
little more important in his life. He's been great.
``As far as Cameron is concerned - he's dad's only grandson - he'll be fine.
He's had to deal with the same things I did. Sometimes he would come home and
say: `You know, dad, the only reason the kids like me at school is because of
you. Because you're hot - and girls like you.' I said: `Cameron, I remember
exactly that as a kid and felt the same thing. They'd say he's Kirk Douglas's
son.'
``Now, they say: `Here's Michael Douglas's son.'' This happened to him and he
had to struggle through that kind of stuff. But he's got a good sense of
confidence. I remember watching him twirl his hair. I do the same thing. And my
mother does it. Now most of the hair is gone. It'll grow back.''
Just as in any other family the children need growth in other ways too. It just
takes some longer than others......

NO Morrissey as support act; no' well. No fun. Bowie these days, no use? Far
from it, actually, completely contradicting last night's low prior
expectations. So where's the chameleon of cool at these days? Well, you need
only gaze upon Supergrass's side-whiskers, say, to know that today's chief
inhabitants of Trendsville are busily reversing into 1972, glam and all that.
Bowie, of course, is the man who invented 1972, and last night's show revealed
that he's heading towards 1979, the year which first gave us industrial
artcore. As well as 1879, a time when light opera was in vogue.
Is Bowie so far behind that he's years ahead again, as in Ziggy Stardust's
bygone days of yore? Who knows. Who cares.
What really matters is that Bowie in 1995 can rock it up most deftly, despite
sporting a daft-looking raggedy, barefoot, lightly-coated-in-flour ensemble
which is not going to set the fashion-world alight.
He started off bravely with a lengthy selection from his current Outside album,
which has likewise failed to set record retailers' cash registers a-ringing.
Brave? Bowie surely diced with danger by kicking off with a song which featured
the line ``there's no hell like an old hell''.
Oh hell; how old we have grown these past 15 years waiting for Bowie to escape
his history and craft an all-good album.
Heck, but there was proof last night there is indeed good new stuff on Outside.
There's Heart's Filthy Lesson, Strangers When We Meet, Hallo Spaceboy. And some
of Bowie's old stuff gets a fresh seeing-to, too: Andy Warhol and Boys Keep
Swinging receive delicious camp-metal make-overs; The Man Who Sold The World
goes glacial trip-hop.
They all sound great. Bowie's arc'ing warble sounds better than ever. Whatever
the year. Whatever fresh genre - industrial-opera? - Bowie's just invented. The
old boy keeps swinging, yes.

THE quips from the audience almost outnumbered those in John Maley's script in
this boisterously, if enthusiastically, received production. But not quite. One
heckler's admonition that ``you have to go to the canteen tae smoke here'' to
some on-stage puffing raised some giggles but the cast had plenty of sharply
observed one-liners to fire back with, such as the caustic comment to a
teenager addicted to the lottery instants cards, ``You'd be better off
scratching your balls.''
Full of ribald and raucous energy this CAT, a theatre collaboration with NCH
Action for Children in association with Inverclyde Intensive Probation Unit,
gives voice to the preoccupations and lifestyles of local youths. Thankfully
the constant humour offset what was otherwise a very bleak picture of days spun
out by shoplifting, gambling, and descent into heroin addiction.
The overriding message - drugs are for mugs - is hardly an original one but the
performances were engaging.
Although director Irvine Allan has split the action into irritatingly short
sequences, which make the thin narrative very jagged, it's an absorbing slice
of live drama. The production is accompanied by a visual arts exhibition and
the final performance on Saturday will be followed by a gig by Whiteout.

ST ANDREW is a long-suffering sort of saint: yesterday, on his name day, three
separate sets of politicians and activists pinned the saltire on their own
proposals for Scotland's future. In the way of these things only one will win
favour with the electorate, and that is just as well. In Edinburgh the Scottish
Constitutional Convention's proposals for a Scottish Parliament were formally
launched with dignity, ceremonial, and the inevitable pipe band. Mr Alex
Salmond of the Scottish National Party chose the same moment to describe his
own constitutional blueprint and, straining the patience of the Saint to
breaking point, the Secretary of State for Scotland produced the detailed
version of his musings on the subject.
Behind the gallimaufry of the day there is a desperately serious point. All of
these proposals deal directly with the future governance of Scotland and it is
clear that in this country, just as in the rest of Britain, there is a deep
antipathy to the current political dispensation. That assertion does not hang
unsupported; all political parties report as much, although they do not like to
speak of it. Last week the annual survey of British Social Attitudes
illustrated the depth of cynicism abroad in the land and reported that fewer
than one in four voters had the slightest confidence that politicians put
nation before party. The effect was particularly notable among the young and
there is no doubt that the same effect applies throughout Scotland, though
hopefully in a less damaging manner.
Yet we have one great advantage, and it was on display in all its distinctly
variable glory yesterday. The very illogicality of the political situation in
Scotland, where poll after poll shows a desire for Scots to have more control
over their own affairs, where Scots in recent years have persisted in giving
the majority of their votes to any party but the one which sits in authority
over them, has acted as a catalyst for political creativity. People have sat
down and thought about what should be done; they have gathered together,
written pamphlets, made speeches, and by their activity encouraged those who
disagree with them to do the same thing. It is good and healthy and although we
suffer in Scotland from what can only be called a democratic deficit in the way
we are governed, yet we have enjoyed a debate which has in itself been
liberating.
It has not all been stimulating stuff, of course. Those who argue in favour of
devolution have suffered occasionally from the wearing of rose-tinted glasses
while those who oppose have often lowered the debate by resorting to lurid
warnings of doom. Businessmen appear particularly confused, with a recent
survey for the Scottish Chambers of Commerce indicating a shift of opinion
towards acceptance of devolution, an opinion which appeared to be contradicted
by an agnostic senior representative of the CBI in Glasgow yesterday.
Nevertheless the effort has been worth while and it is now time, especially
with a maximum of 15 months or so before the next General Election, to absorb
what has happened and to take it forward.
In assessing the conflicting claims there is one constant, and that is the
importance of the Union for all Scots. Yet this concept needs to be defined if
it is to be understood. We live in a united state which is called the United
Kingdom, but it is not a unitary state as the Union represents a shared
sovereignty involving the preservation of separate nationhood. That is a fact -
even though it is persistently ignored by the Prime Minister, whose reading is
dyslexic in the extreme and who continues to represent Scotland as a subsidiary
part of a unitary nation. Devolution, Mr Major believes, is a threat to the
Union. As unionists we would argue that it is his understanding of the nature
of the Union and the policies which flow from it which present oportunities to
anti-unionists and which are most likely to endanger the Union. The Secretary
of State for Scotland, Mr Michael Forsyth, has seen that this approach is
insufficient. With some subtlety he has set about concocting a response to
those who argue for devolution. At a gut level his target is clearly the
revenue-raising capabilities of the proposed Scottish parliament, what he is
pleased to call the ``Tartan Tax''.
In his speech yesterday he raised the terrible prospect of jobs being lost and
Scots forced to pay dearly to live at home through the imposition of the
Scottish parliament's proposed 3p revenue-raising powers. This is lively
politics, but suspect in many respects. We already know from the work of
Strathclyde University's Professor Neil Hood that devolution, with all that it
entails, would have no effect on the willingness of foreign companies to invest
in Scotland. There is evidence from some economists, presented today in this
newspaper, that the ``Tartan Tax'' would not deter the growth of domestic
investment in Scotland but would, instead, have the useful effect of dampening
the harmful fluctuations in the business cycle.
Mr Forsyth's idea of devolution is to make great play of involving the Scottish
Grand Committee in what will in fact be toothless play-acting, and apparently
to give more powers to local councils in matters such as responsibility for
some trunk roads and over settling their capital spending priorities. It is a
mystery how this squares with his determination to retain powers to cap local
authority spending and to force councils into joint ventures through the
controversial Private Finance Initiative. Mr Forsyth clearly has difficulties.
To move too far towards genuine devolution would oblige him to accept some of
the arguments of his opponents, and this he will not do. His proposals are weak
and disappointing and fail utterly to meet people's expectations.
If you believe the Union to be of great importance to Scots the arguments of Mr
Salmond fall, even although they are presented with considerable style and
insight. The SNP's support waxes and wanes, upwards with Braveheart and
downwards as the emotions cool, but it represents an adventure which a majority
of Scots will not contemplate, including many of those who voted for Ms
Cunningham in Perth and Kinross this year.
There has been a hardening of opinion over the years in Scotland in favour of
constitutional change. If such change is needed, and it is, the most acceptable
means of achieving it lies in the work of the Scottish Constitutional
Convention. We have already welcomed devolution in principle, arguing that it
will allow the development of Scottish skills and talents which are at present
stifled or lost to other countries. The programme which has been brought
forward by the convention is democratic, balanced, and creative. There are many
details which must still be worked out and even more arguments to win. Yet it
is clear that in this great debate an important step forward has been taken.
The requirement now is for more debate, more detail, and an understanding that
the status quo, or even peripheral tinkering with it, is simply not good
enough. Scotland needs a new political dispensation and the way ahead is clear.

INCEST and infanticide, greed and lust, there is certainly something raw and
elemental about Eugene O'Neill's Desire Under the Elms - the play that in 1924
America stirred up so much animosity it was banned from being performed in
Boston and other American cities.
Set against the background of a harsh, unremitting landscape and the constant
invocation of an inflexible, demanding Old Testament God, O'Neill's reworked
Greek tragedy could be too much.
Polly Teale's magnetic Shared Experience production, however, finds both the
passion and poetry of O'Neill's tortured tale, paradoxically by underlining the
melodrama and bringing home its Irishness. Teale herself has spoken of
transplanting O'Neill's 1850s American Mid-West to Ireland in the 1950s in
order to create a Beckettian world of universal longings.
In Neil Warmington's elegantly simple but also erotic and spiritually symbolic
shack, Teale's production, however, also seems a portrait of how the West was
won and forged by the toil and labour of hordes of Irish immigrant farmers and
their families. Even more, she brings to light the price paid by women in a
man's world.
This performance paints a picture of the life-force at its most terrifying and
crushing.

Phil Penfold meets Kerry Fox, star of a new film which reveals a tragic wartime
love affair
THIS month, television viewers are going to see a lot of actress Kerry Fox. In
a couple of weeks she stars in Saigon Baby, an emotionally charged story of
baby-buying in South-East Asia.
Before that, however, she stars in this Sunday's powerful wartime romance The
Affair - a film which opened her eyes to a little known, some might say hidden,
agenda of atrocities far away from the front-line of battle, but in a sleepy
English village during the Second World War.
``The film's first and foremost a love story,'' stresses New Zealand born Fox,
of Shallow Grave and A Village Affair fame. ``But it's also inspired by a
real-life case, where a black American GI was charged with raping an English
woman, and later hanged for it.''
The 105-minute drama - it's the biggest ever co-production between BBC TV and
American company HBO Showcase - tells the story of a passionate love affair
between a young, married Englishwoman, Maggie Leyland (Fox), and a black GI
Travis Holloway (Courtney B Vance). When her husband, Edward (Ciaran Hinds),
unexpectedly returns from active service and discovers them together, she is
torn between love and familial duty, and is forced to make a decision which has
devastating consequences, and which haunts her for the rest of her life.
Before filming the drama, Fox spoke to several women who lived through the war
and witnessed affairs between friends and visiting American soldiers. She also
watched a documentary containing interviews with eight woman, now in their
mid-to-late 70s, who had suffered great tragedy and trauma through love and
unrequited passions, and were only now able to speak frankly about their
feelings.
``For so many women whose husbands had gone off to war, it was an unusual
time,'' says Fox.``It was a time of vulnerability, but also great freedom.
While they were suffering much pain through the absence of partners, they
suddenly found their emotions being challenged. Having had no individuality for
years, they had no ability to express themselves properly, and often they had
no control over the situation.''
Looking elegant in a black silk trouser suit, Fox takes a sip of wine and says:
``I listened to women who endured separations and terrible tragedies - and like
Maggie bore their crosses silently. That made me have so much confidence in
this screenplay.''
But taking on the part of Maggie Leyland was a major surprise to Fox herself,
as she came to the production of The Affair at a time when she was convinced
she would not be doing any work.
``I was still in the Phillipines where I had just finished filming Saigon
Baby,'' she recalls. ``That had been a killer of a job - physically and
mentally - and I was at my hotel packing for a much-needed holiday in
Australia, when I received a 100 page fax from producer David Thompson in
London.
``David said at the top of it, `Don't go to Australia, you've got to come back
to the UK for this.' So I read the screenplay at 4.00am. Shooting for the film
was to start in six weeks' time. I knew there and then I had to do it.''
So Fox changed all her plans, and two days later - jet-lagged after an 18-hour
flight from Manila - she was in London auditioning for the part of Maggie. At
first, Fox readily admits, the attractions of doing The Affair were superficial.
``After Saigon Baby, I thought The Affair was a breeze - and in certain
respects, it was,'' says Fox. ``Filming in Norfolk, and going back to my flat
in London every night, was a lot safer and cosier than filming in the middle of
the Philippines, where we were walking among human waste and dead dogs.
``I was freer to indulge my emotions, and besides, we had huge American

``But then, the more I got into Maggie's dilemma, the more it became a hugely
emotional challenge. It's beyond me to think how I'd have dealt with being a
woman in wartime with her husband away. How would I cope without knowing if I'd
ever see him again? I'd find that impossible enough.
``But then to find myself becoming involved with another man, knowing it was
wrong. To be that vulnerable - and then to have to lie about him when she faces
the very real threat of losing her son. The terrible tragedy for Maggie is that
had she told the truth from the start, she could have saved Travis's life.''
Producer David Thompson had long wanted to make a film about black servicemen
because their presence in Britain is a little-known aspect of the Second World
War. He pursued his interest in the subject after reading article about 19
American soldiers executed during the war at Shepton Mallet prison in Somerset.
``It seemed an extraordinary, incongruous state of affairs. How could these men
have been hanged in the middle of the sleepy English countryside?
Of the 19 GIs hanged at Shepton Mallet, 12 were black. ``This is an
extraordinary statistic considering that black prisoners made up only 10% of
the entire American military here,'' says Thompson. ``Apparently, there were no
white soldiers executed on the sole charge of rape, only black GIs.''
n.The Affair is on BBC1 this Sunday at 9.05pm.

In his usual anti-Catholic diatribe, Faithful daughter of Mother Church
(November 28), John Macleod yet again demonstrates his total allergy to the
truth.
At the time of the setting-up of the Irish Free State in 1922 the proportion of
the population in the 26 Counties who were not Roman Catholics was 5%, and not
the 10% attested to by John Macleod.
There is no doubt that this figure has fallen, but equally there is no doubt
that it has not fallen as a result of ``hundreds of Protestants bombed, burned
or frightened out of the Emerald Isle''.
After the implementation of the 1921 Treaty and the 1920 Government of Ireland
Act, with the creation of separate Governments in Belfast and Dublin, the only
pogroms to occur happened in the North.
Sectarian riots in the summer of 1920 claimed in excess of 80 lives in Belfast
and Derry. The cause of these clashes was the expulsion from their jobs in the
shipyards of Belfast of the Catholic workers by the Protestant workers, and the
oppression of the Catholic population by the police and Government.
J J Lee observes in his Ireland 1912-1985: Politics and Society that in the
first six months of 1922, 171 Catholics and 93 Protestants were killed, ``often
in the most revolting of circumstances''. He adds: ``On a per capita basis,
Protestants were scoring four kills to every one by Catholics''.
At this time there were available for the maintenance of law and order in the
North of Ireland a remarkable number of police officers by comparison to the
rest of the UK - one policeman to every two Catholic families. And they were
armed! That they did not prevent this slaughter was due to the fact that they
were taking part in it.
No similar reports, then or later, emanated from the Free State.
The explanation for the decrease in the percentage of Protestants resident in
the Republic of Ireland today is the long-term effect of the First World War on
the Anglo-Irish community.
John Macleod also writes: ``To this day, the elections of a Protestant on the
Dail is a novelty''. And so it may well be, but it is a possibility enshrined
in the Constitution to protect the rights of the small Protestant population of
the 26 Counties. This is still the case today. Unlike in the North.
In the North, PR was abolished by James Craig in 1929. This removed the last
vestige of democracy in those Six Counties. It was now a wholly gerrymandered
State.
John Macleod refers to Article 44 of the 1937 Constitution which recognised the
``special position'' of the Catholic Church. This is no great surprise in view
of the attempts of English and later British Governments to exterminate the
Catholic Church and its followers from Ireland. An attempted genocide that
spanned many centuries and many kings, queens and governments.
Article 44 also recognised the rights of the other Churches in Ireland. It is
of great credit to Eamon de Valera that he specifically included in this
recognition ``the Jewish congregations'' at a time when the Jewish people in
other parts of Europe were already being herded into concentration camps.
If John Macleod takes exception to a Roman Catholic bishop reminding his Irish
flock that, irrespective of any change to the Constitution of the Republic of
Ireland, in the eyes of the Church you cannot obtain a civil divorce and
continue to receive the Sacraments if you should subsequently remarry, then he
should also inform the Archbishop of Canterbury of his displeasure. After all
that Protestant prelate preaches to the same tune.

All over the country, David Belcher learns,
easy-listening fans are coming out of their wardrobe units and into the Boudoir
THEY call 'em tunes, today's kids do, but melodious is what most modern records
aren't, isn't it? If it's not yon horrid techno blare, it's your blarting punky
post-post-grunge racket. Young 'uns . . . cuh! If you ask me - and no-one did -
this new generation will end up deafened, daft, and unable to engage in any
form of social intercourse whatsoever.
Yet maybe things aren't entirely bleak. Because some wised-up, now-a-go-go
kiddies are skipping along the mellow path of enlightenment to
Easylisteningville, the place so uncool it's red hot, grand-daddio.
How to define easy listening? Edinburgh groove-maestro Pete Baikie should know.
As well as providing Channel 4's Absolutely with musical interludes, he's
responsible for the easy-listening theme tune to Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer's
Shooting Stars on BBC.
According to Pete, easy listening is ``the aural equivalent of Peter Wyngarde's
visual appearance in TV's Department S: velvety and dapper. Easy listening is
brassy trumpets and a reverberant Farfisa organ. Most crucially, it's dance
music for folk who are unashamed to confess that they can't dance - and they
aren't going to take any pills which will delude them that they can.''
In Glasgow, Boudoir is a Tuesday-night mecca for easy listening buffs. Located
in the 13th Note's basement, Boudoir this month celebrates its third
anniversary. Its founder, the mysterious Doctor Paul, hymns easy listening's
night-time lure.
``You can't have conversations in other clubs, which I regard as a grave
insult: `Here's some loud music - we assume you do not wish to talk.' Boudoir
is about love, and love means people speaking to one another.'' As well as
playing Ker-Plunk, Operation, and 3-D Connect Four with each other, staple
Boudoir pastimes all.
Doctor Paul is dismissive of the current wave of new easy-listening CD
compilations and re-issues, stressing the role of charity shops. He scoffs at
A&amp;M's re-release of greatest-hits albums like Guantanamera by the Sandpipers
and Burt Bacharach's orchestral epic Reach Out. ``CDs are a complete rip-off!
Why pay #15 for one album when you can go to a charity shop and get loads of
beautiful vinyl for the same price. Hundreds of LPs at 60p each.''
For how much longer, though. Charity shops in Glasgow studentland are running
low on stocks of Ray Conniff albums. It's harder to find 75p bargains such as
Action Replay: BBC Sporting Themes, including Pot Black, or the insomnia-curing
Kaleidoscopic Vibrations of the Moog by Perrey and Kingsley, both of which are
among Doctor Paul's most memorable finds.
So take the Doctor's prescription: check out Largs and Perth. ``Largs is full
of old Mike Sammes-lovers who keep dying, while in Perth, no-one's cool enough
to buy James Last In Russia.''
James Last? James pigging Last? I can't be doing with James Last . . . he
noodles other people's songs to death.
``Not if you get to his versions first. James Last's really funky. Listen to
his interpretation of the 2001 Theme and you'll learn that the beauty of easy
listening is cover versions that are slightly twisted.''
Ach, awa' wi' James Last. Bring me top Glasgow rhumba-pumpers the Johnny 7
instead. I meet two of the quartet in their city-centre penthouse pad,
liberally furnished with sixties-era lava lamps. Jason Famous and Dickey Molenz
are indisposed, so it's Pat M'Bongo and Rick Flick who view me over their
suspiciously effulgent moustaches.
It transpires that Boudoir was where the band were re-born, their 40-year
career having taken a dip after the highlight of appearing at the Montrose
Festival with Jimi Henderson.
Now, however, the band feel the emergent easy-listening scene is in imminent
danger of mainstream dilution by trendy London bandwagon-jumpers. They
pooh-pooh Radio 1 joss-dickey Chris Evans for his enthusiastic championing of
Mike Flowers's Pops de-fanged version of Oasis's Wonderwall. ``All these
listeners that Radio 1's lost? They're going to Radio 2, it's obvious,'' sneers
Pat.
``There are two bitterly opposed easy-listening camps these days,'' continues
Rick. ``There's hardcore: Engelbert, Bassey, O'Connor. And there's softcore -
Abba, Neil Diamond - for folk who think it's all a joke, a laugh . . . Well,
that's cheesy listening in our book - not proper easy listening.''
So it's not a joke?
``No. And you'll find all Glasgow's coolest indie bands down the front at our
live gigs. Urusei Yatsura, AC Acoustics, the Pastels, Bis, Pink Kross, One
Dove. Having got their teenage angst out with their loud, rowdy guitar music,
they come to us to chill out and experience the mood-music of love.''
Clued-in cats thus need feel no shame at openly embracing a music which has
hitherto been terminally unfashionable?
``With age comes musical wisdom,'' says Rick. ``There's nothing wrong in
admitting that you like Trini Lopez and Doris Day as well as Rangers Against
The Machinery, or whatever they're called. All over the country easy-listening
fans are coming out of their Formica-covered wardrobe units.''
Similarly, when the Johnny 7 work their magic on more contemporary numbers such
as Blur's Girls And Boys or Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, the band don't
consider they are changing them. ``Rather, we are returning them to their
original form, easifissimo. Anything that liberates musical taste is good after
all. Because narrow-minded devotion to any one genre is bad. Apart, that is,
from a devotion to easy listening.''
This formula is certainly paying off for the Johnny 7. They'll be on STV's
Chartbite Christmas Special, with live Glasgow gigs scheduled for Glasgow
University Union's Dafter Friday on December 15; Cottiers, December 21, and the
city's official George Square Hogmanay bash.
They may also at long last fulfil a booking to support Bjorn Again at Glasgow
Royal Concert Hall on December 23. They were meant to last Christmas Eve, ``but
we stayed in to watch Never Say Never Again on the telly,'' says Pat.
``We'll definitely turn up this time,'' says Rick. ``Unless they screen You
Only Live Twice.''
Their most immediate engagement is an unusual gig in Habitat on Tuesday
evening. ``Our contract specifies 24% discount,'' says Pat, confessing to a
fancy for a nice coffee table. ``And a pot-rack for me,'' says Rick.
Pot? Surely, you don't mean . . .
Rick looks aghast. ``Drugs are out of fashion. The rack's for my pots. I like
to cook up a nice chicken fricassee.''
That's the practical tastiness of easy listening. Hear it, children. Before you
no longer can.
n Essential listening (even if it is on CD).
The Easy Project: 20 Loungecore Favourites, various (Sequel); The Sound Gallery
(EMI) and The Sound Spectrum (Castle), various.
Three current compilations variously offering top film and telly themes, among
them The Avengers, Catweazle, Budgie, Thank Your Lucky Stars, and Get Carter,
as well as the Milk Tray ad. Step this way for rampant drums; sickly organ, and
inappropriate trumpets. Above all, there are no words to get in the way of the
easy listening message, and that message is: Frug your Eezee-Wosh hipsters on
my brown shag-pile till we combust, baby!

I WAS deprived of a first-hand look at the faces of Tory MPs as the Chancellor
of the Exchequer sat down at the end of his Budget speech, but by all accounts
they were a picture to savour.
Any Tory Chancellor who can provoke headlines like ``A penny for your votes''
from the Daily Telegraph and ``Where's the magic?'' from the Daily Mail,
alongside a cartoon of a very large hat and a very small rabbit, has my vote.
The truth is that the Tories are now so constrained by borrowing (in spite of
the family silver and North Sea oil) and low tax yields having de-skilled and
short-timed half the British workforce, there is little room for manoeuvre
without the financial markets going into tailspin.
Anyway, enough of the Budget. I wasn't even there, though that is not always a
barrier to the reporting of events. By the time Mr Clarke stood up I was en
route for an altogether happier occasion in my constituency.
The scene was Gateside village hall, with a portrait of our greatest
egalitarian, Robert Burns, hanging over the entrance. Seldom had this
well-balanced and distinctive community been on the receiving end of so much
political and media attention.
It arose from the fact that a petition had been organised, calling for a ballot
to decide whether or not Gateside Primary School, with its 62 pupils, should
become only the third in Scotland to opt out of the local-government system and
become ``self-governing''.
I admit this initiative, when it first surfaced, took me by surprise. The more
I spoke to and received letters from local people, the clearer it became that
it had been no more premeditated by them - including some who belatedly
discovered the significance of what they had signed.
For the past month I had been saying to all who asked that I was happy to leave
the outcome to the good sense of my constituents, the parents, who would
benefit from the minimum of outside interference. Seldom has such faith been so
richly rewarded.
The meeting was quite splendid and concluded with the school board being
authorised to seek legal advice on the signing of the petition and whether the
parents could have their signatures back.
For good measure, I was mandated to ask Michael Forsyth to call the whole thing
off now rather than allow it to drag on for another two months pending a
ballot, under the auspices of the Electoral Reform Society, which no more than
two or three seemed to want.
It would be idle to deny I enjoyed the occasion politically. The icing on the
cake was an ill-judged contribution in support of opting out from Forsyth's
long-serving sidekick, one Alan Hogarth, who announced himself as representing
the Cunninghame North Conservative Association. I am much obliged, Mr Hogarth.
But the success of the occasion lay in the triumphs of something much less
transient than party politics. In word and deed the meeting turned into a
testimony to the intrinsic worth of the Scottish education tradition, of which
I have never been more proud to be a product.
The spokesman for the school board, Alistair Wilson, told the meeting that the
more he knew about opting out the more he recognised it as not just nonsense
but dangerous nonsense, completely alien to the Scottish tradition of the local
school as part of the community. It was a fine articulation of what virtually
everyone in that hall felt in their bones.
People were angry that their own names had been taken in vain and that the name
of their village had been dragged through divisive publicity in a cause which
they wanted nothing to do with. The head teacher called for an early end to
uncertainty which was affecting the children's education.
Almost all those who spoke with such strength and confidence were clearly
products of the education system which a few individuals, usually from outside
it, commit so much zeal and deviousness to undermining. And once again they
have failed.
By Wednesday I was back in Westminster listening to the same Michael Forsyth,
with his latest wheeze for restoring Tory fortunes. The Scottish Grand
Committee, it seems, is to be turned into a perpetually travelling circus in
which the Deer Amendment (Scotland) Bill can be debated at leisure.
Watching this hunched and furtive little figure, as he read out this hastily
cobbled together nonsense, I tried again to work out what makes him tick.
Apart from sheer prejudice it is, I think, a dehumanised conviction that
politics is all about illusion, about fixing, about putting one over on your
opponents. People are meant to say: ``Isn't he smart'' as the highest form of
tribute.
But that is not what they say at all. Rather, they are reinforcing the view
that government by an unrepresentative and extremist clique, as represented by
Mr Forsyth, has gone on for far too long. And that takes me right back to the
reaction of decent people in Gateside village hall.
Same malign architect. Same public response. Three cheers for the Scottish
educational tradition.

WHAT an odd ragbag of pieces last night from the Royal Scottish National
Orchestra: a bit of pleasant juvenilia, a rarity, and an unusual view of a
masterpiece. All fascinating to hear, though not amounting to much.
Russian conductors seem to have a thing about Elgar, and I recall Alexander
Lazarev, when he was appointed principal guest conductor of the RSNO, muttering
about wanting to do the olde English gent. It would be interesting to hear
Lazarev conducting something meaty (the symphonies), but last night we had to
make do with the attractive, eclectic, and rather vegetarian collection of
pieces that comprise the second Wand of Youth Suite.
Things picked up with pianist Murray McLachlan as soloist in Dohnanyi's
brilliant Variations on a Nursery Song, which take Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
on a stellar trip through a galaxy of musical styles. Wittily played, if a
little underpowered by the pianist, this was one of those performances which
suggested that Alexander Lazarev, though he can seem dour, has in fact a droll
sense of humour.
Outstanding performance of the night, however, was Stravinsky's Petrushka, with
Lazarev appearing to dump the usual panache of the piece, concentrating instead
on textures that were so clear, raw, garish, and lurid that you could see right
through them; an often gripping performance.

As Scottish prisons groan with overcrowding, JEAN WEST asks: do we really need
so many scapegoats?
THIS week two seasoned prison officers broke down and wept at the fatal
accident inquiry of a tragic young charge. The lifeless corpse of teenager
Arlene Elliot was found hanging in her cell at Cornton Vale prison just outside
Stirling in the summer. She was the latest young casualty of a draconian penal
system hellbent on revenge and still intent on showing society who is boss.
The 17-year-old from Partick, Glasgow, had admitted shoplifting offences and
was awaiting reports while on remand.
Three days earlier another girl, Kelly Holland, at 17 again barely out of her
childhood, took her desperate suicidal thoughts to their awful conclusion. The
youngster, on remand at the same prison for breach of the peace, had a history
of similar charges. She left her devastated parents, Edward and Isobel, a
letter begging forgiveness. After soul-searching for reasons for letting them
down, she still could not say what drove her to offend repeatedly. Two wasted
young lives. Two trivial charges.
The Howard League for Penal Reform have said they consider it verging on the
barbaric to keep jailing young girls. But alternatives to custodial sentences
do exist as an innovative project in Greenock aims to show this week. At the
town's Arts Guild, young offenders from the Inverclyde intensive probation unit
will make their stage debut with a labour of love far removed from criminal
activity. The scheme is part of an enlightened effort to keep 16 to
21-year-olds away from the ``universities of crime''.
A new play Greenock Central, sponsored by National Children's Homes and
directed by Cat A Theatre Company, gives 14 young offenders the opportunity to
look at their lives and express feelings about the situations while
contributing something positive to the community.
Unit leader Paul Carberry said: ``We offer different programmes to help young
people deal with their behaviour and wean them away from crime as a direct
alternative to custody.''
He added: ``At the unit we have mutual respect for each other. There is
dialogue and we try to reach a common understanding. From that comes change.''
There are many reasons - social, economic, psychological, some even say
physiological - why people turn to crime. Carberry's wards are encouraged
through creativity and positive peer influences to examine their individual
problems and look at ways to break free.
``The majority of young people here are second-generation unemployed,'' added
Carberry.
George McIvor, 21, had just completed an intensive probation order. When he
punched his pal unconscious during a brawl he braced himself for jail. Already
pulled up by the police for taking prescribed drugs and selling stolen goods,
he expected months if not longer inside. Ironically, referral to the Inverclyde
project put him side by side with the youth - once more a mate - he knocked out
after a night on the town. George got through the unit and found himself a job.
So, was it a better option than doing time?
``Well, I've not been jailed yet,'' said George who stars in the play.
``The unit has changed me a lot. I look at things differently now. Before I
would do anything to feed a drug habit, now I know it's not worth it.
``The play has been a great ego boost. I had never acted at all before but I
look forward to going on stage. My friends and family are coming to see it.''
Greenock Central is both comic and tragic. The natural wit of many of these
youngsters has been tapped effectively by Cat A playwright John Maley. This is
punctuated by a sadness that comes from human disasters all too familiar in
their short lives.
George told the story of the death of his friend: ``Last October a pal who had
stayed with us and was like a brother died from an overdose. It had a really
deep effect on me. I've seen it happen too often.''
Cat A administrator Annie George said: ``The play looks at the real lives of
these young people. It looks at petty crime, drug abuse, drinking, and
gambling, and at their wistful dreams of escape.''
Irvine Allan, who directed the piece, has long been attacking a system in
Britain which incarcerates more young people than anywhere else in Europe apart
from Turkey and by the end of last year had more than 12,400 on remand.
He said: ``A lot of the young people in Greenock Central are written off as
unworkable, uneducatable, untouchable if you like. But it's not the case. The
performance helps give them a sense of value.
``Short, sharp, shock, military discipline, boot camp-type solutions don't
work. The need for revenge prevails. We are still looking to marginalise and
demonise these young people because of our own fear and misunderstanding.''
He added: ``It's a learning process both for us and for them. And it is a
positive thing to see people learning to create rather than destroy.''
A cautious community in Greenock are beginning to warm to the youngsters. Some
members have become involved.
Jean Robertson said: ``My attitudes have been completely changed. I thought
that people who took drugs and drink were hobos. But the boys and girls here
are not like that. They would be the first to help you if you have a problem.''
Perhaps Michael Howard could take a leaf from her book.
n Greenock Central runs at the Greenock Arts Guild until Saturday, December 2.
Guests on Saturday night are Greenock band Whiteout.

ONCE upon a time, fairy stories were how wee weans learned about the many faces
of good and evil. This was long before plastic surgery and plastic money meant
folk could be two-faced on the never-never. Fairy stories - especially the ones
by Hans Christian Andersen - acknowledged cruelty in a far more profound way
than any splat-blat cartoon, and the endings often suggested that happiness
could come in unexpected ways.
The Tin Solder - adapted and directed by Chris Craig for Wildcat - understands
the power of this. Celebrates it in a production which believes that even young
children - I watched it with mainly under-eights - can engage with quite
complex issues of bleakness, joy, integrity, and courage.
Enter the figure of Andersen - Hans Christian played by an engagingly avuncular
David Anderson - who guides the narrative, and makes the words work as if they
were magic spells. As he thinks them out loud, or writes them down, they bring
alive the pretty, quirling Ballerina (Veronica Leer) and her stalwart, smitten
Tin Soldier (Sandy Nelson) whose happiness and love is envied and apparently
destroyed by the fiery Goblin - a marvellously growly prowly creature (Lesley
Robertson), who is literally heartless.
Craig has stayed commendably close to the story, right to the bitter sweet end
when the innocents are engulfed by flames but their true hearts remain melted
together for ever.

I TAKE issue with the offensive tone of John Macleod's article on the Irish
divorce referendum (November 28). Surely the Catholic Church is to be applauded
for attempting to stabilise and promote Christian family values.
John Macleod's negative attitude is in evidence with the short sharp statement
that abortion is outlawed in the constitution but failing to take the
opportunity to commend the Catholic Church for her stance in this issue, as I
was under the impression that he shares the same view. Regarding his aside on
infallibility, he fails to grasp the real meaning behind this emotive term in
that it is the Church's duty under the stewardship of the presiding Pope to
ensure the Gospel truths and all that emanates from them are upheld and
protected throughout the ages.
There has been an ongoing evangelisation within ``Mother church'' for some
considerable time, thus I trust allaying his concern for Latin American
Catholics departing for pastures new. We too adhere to Scripture and can, and
do, spread the Good News without restriction. Many of his articles in recent
times have tackled the Catholic church on several issues. We are sufficiently
broad-shouldered to take the criticism. However, it is of great sadness that
when producing his critique John Macleod does not reflect on St Paul's words
contained in I Corinthians, Chapter 13; then his writings could take on the
spirit of charity and his opinions would have wider credibility.

IARTHUR Scargill has presented an important challenge to progressive elements
in the Labour and trade-union movement. It would determine the shape of future
social and trade-union rights under the next Labour Government. Nevertheless,
this challenge is misplaced.
A breakaway party of socialists now would be incomprehensible to ordinary
working people and trade unionists. They wish above all to see an end to
Conservative rule.
To embark upon a breakaway would make it even easier for Tony Blair to sever
the remaining links between the Labour Party and the trade unions. It would
make it harder to advance arguments to reinstate necessary legal safeguards on
legitimate trade union activities.
A Labour Government will most likely be faced with severe economic difficulties
as the longer-term structural weaknesses of the UK economy become manifest.
Tony Blair might well, as Harold Wilson did twice, be tempted to declare states
of national emergency.
A crisis of sufficient magnitude could even lead the Labour Party into a
Government of National Unity. This too is a scenario with a strong historical
precedent.
To remove the left from the Labour Party at this crucial juncture would be to
prevent a consequential more wide-ranging realignment of Labour policies in the
future.

STUART HENRY, the Scottish disc jockey who died last week, took his
unconformist ways with him - if not to the grave then certainly on the road to
it.
Stuart was Scotland's most prominent member of the flower-power generation. He
was the focus of those get-togethers in the botanic gardens which made
Glasgow's West End seem just like San Francisco's Haight Ashbury. (Well, the
kaftans were similar.)
His successful career took him from Radio Scotland (the floating one, off
Dunbar) to the big-time on Radio 1 and then to Radio Luxembourg. He suffered
from multiple scleroris for the last 20 of his 53 years.
And so to the story of his last journey. The crematorium in Luxembourg, where
he lived, being unavailable, Stuart's family and friends had to take his body
across the border to Belgium.
Despite the European Union's philosophy of no frontiers, the Belgian border
police refused to let the cortege through. Only after long argument was the
funeral party allowed to go about its sad business.
One of the reasons for the Belgian polis being suspicious was the garb of the
funeral director. He was wearing denims instead of the traditonal dark suit.
Cronies conned
THE chairman of the Largs Cronies Burns Club St Andrew's dinner introduced the
main speaker for the night - his cousin Sybil from Australia. Cousin Sybil
walked in wearing a blonde wig and dark glasses which she whipped off to reveal
herself as none other than Kirsty Wark, TV journalist par excellence and old
girl of Wellington Academy, the Ayrshire finishing school.
Ms Wark then took off her dress. For those who may have allowed Ms Wark's
comeliness to intrude into their thoughts as she conducts serious interviews on
Newsnight, it should be pointed out that she was wearing another dress
underneath.
Here's to new
technology
ALEX Salmond of the SNP addressed the St Andrew's dinner of the Scottish
European Association in Brussels. The programme for the proceedings was
translated into the other European languages for the benefit of guests from
other nations. A new bit of European Union hi-tech computer software was used
which gives instant translations. Mr Salmond's ``toast to Scotland'' appeared
as ``petit pain grille a L'Ecosse''.
Posthaste
ONE of the first bits of mail to hit our desk in the wake of the postal strike
was a Christmas card. Nice and early, we thought.
But what gives a certain piquancy to its smart delivery by the now returned
postal service is that it was sent, even before all 12 million items in the
backlog of strike-bound mail have been sorted and dispatched, by no less a
communicator that Peter Howarth CBE, managing director of the Royal Mail.
Mr Howarth's greeting shows a fluffy robin red breast jamming up the slot of a
letter box . . . appropriate enough in the light of recent postal chaos. But
what may exercise the letter-writing classes even more - to say nothing of
those still waiting for cheques, pin numbers, and football tickets turned
ephemera - is that Mr Howarth states, alongside a tariff of his organisation's
charges: ``We all like to receive our Christmas cards early''. . . no mention
of letters that were posted a fortnight ago and have not yet arrived.
Urging speedy action on the Christmas-card front Mr Howarth continues: ``At
this time of year we deliver up to double the normal amount of post.'' This
year we all know why.
Fitting climax
WE whetted your appetite earlier this week, perhaps, with some book excerpts
which failed to win the Literary Review magazine's annual Bad Sex Prize. It was
all sweaty armpits, meaty thighs, and quivering flesh.
To qualify for the Bad Sex Prize, the passage should be ``redundant,
perfunctory, unconvincing, and embarrassing as well as unacceptably crude''.
And the winner this year is from Philip Kerr's Gridiron published by Chatto &amp;
Windus with:
His tremulous thumbs gathered the elastic waist of her panties and plucked them
down over the twin golden domes of her behind and back up over the suspended
sentences and Sobranie filter-tips of her stocking tops as, obligingly, she
brought her knees up to her chest. She straightened her feet and the little
stealth bomber of black lace and silk was his.
Quickly he threw off his own clothes and rolled on top of her. Detaching mind
from over-eager gnomon and its exquisitely appointed, shadowy task, he made
love to her.
The Literary Review judges were particularly impressed by ``the suspended
sentences and Sobranie filter-tips of her stocking tops''. A gnomon, if you
didn't already know, is the sticky-up bit of a sundial.
Philip Kerr, the writer, should worry at this mocking of his prose. His book is
going into paperback and the film rights have been sold for a million dollars.
Wise up
OUR festive competition requires you dear readers to nominate a fourth Wise
Person to visit the stable in Bethlehem bearing an appropriate gift.
The first award goes to Ken Cawley of Coatbridge who was quick on the fax with
the following nominations:
Robert Maxwell, with a personal pension plan for the baby Jesus.
The leader of Monklands District Council with a pink job application (should
He ever need a job).
Duncan Ferguson, offering a kiss - a Glasgow kiss. Gazza might also be there,
elbowing the other Wise Men out of the way to get a better look.

Scotlean Pigs, the Carlisle-based co-operative pig marketing group, has ended
its trading year with a turnover in excess of #41m.
Chairman James Wylie said that membership had increased by almost 25% and now
stood at 137. Pig sales increased to 13,000 a week.
With the addition of another member of staff Scotlean has begun to encourage
pig marketing co-operation in the West Midlands area.
Mr Wyllie forecast another year of growth but emphasised that member commitment
was the first ingredient in maintaining the co-op's strength and its standing
with abattoir operators.
Correction
THE winner of the Holstein Friesian junior cow section at this week's Dairy
Scot event was Alister H Laird of Blyth Farm, Blyth Bridge, West Linton. His
entry Altona Lea Broker Emma also took the junior cow inter-breed prize and won
the special class award for cows giving over 10,000kg. She was judged to have
the best udder in the Holstein Friesian section.
New phase
THE second phase of Aberdeen and Northern Marts new auction centre at Elgin
will be officialy opened next Wednesday.The new hall will be used for furniture
and antique sales and other specialist non-agricultural events.
Meat cuts
SLAUGHTER staff at Scotch Premier Meat's Edinburgh plant have agreed to
concentrate their working week into four days as part of a cost-cutting
exercise. The slaughtermen will continue to work the same number of hours and
the throughput of beef and lamb at the plant will not be affected. The benefit
to the company is a considerable saving in cleaning and washing-up costs and
the opportunity to carry out essential maintenance on a Friday. The plant's
boning and butchery departments will continue to work a five-day week.

WHERE are the industries and jobs of tomorrow to come from? Easy question to
pose. Devilishly difficult one to answer with any ring of conviction.
We've grown blase about computers and their software, hole-in-the-wall-banking,
mobile phones, video stores, theme parks, and all the other trappings of
mid-1990s life. Many of today's can't-be-withouts didn't even exist in the
mid-1970s. So what, come 2020 say, is next?
Some money is on biotechnology. More seems to be on the burgeoning age of
information. A BBC poll for the Bookworm programme the other day revealed a
disturbingly high percentage of the sample convinced books and the printed word
had virtually had their day. Superseded by silicon, victim to the Internet and
the CD-ROM, the printed word is heading for smokestack status it seems. If that
poll is right much of the forestry industry is in for a profound shock and
people like me can start looking for another job.
Needless to say I think these doomsters are a bit wide of the mark. If the
bicycle can reinvent itself and survive the advent of mass car ownership, if
mail volumes continue to expand in line with the growth in fax traffic, I
suspect newspapers (and books) will be around long enough to see me out and a
bit beyond that.
That Bookworm poll had another intriguing finding. Significantly more of those
questioned would want to be marooned on a desert island with a scientific book
than with a volume of poetry.
We have a curiously ambivalent attitude to the sciences and the technologies
they spawn. At one level we caricature scientists, like inventors, as madcaps
in white coats, surrounded by bubbling test tubes, wreathed in electric
discharges. At a more sinister level, both nuclear and genetic engineering -
the fruits respectively of scientific inquiry into the fundamental particles of
matter and life - are widely perceived in the public mind as grave potential
threats to our planet and our humanity.
But we also, as the poll suggests, maintain a reflex belief that science can
still solve many of this world's problems. Science, not poetry, might get you
off that island the poll is saying. So, to return to my original question,
science and technology would surely feature high up most people's lists of
where tomorrow's industries and jobs will come from. Applied science has
already given us everything from the internal combustion engine to the memory
chip. Why should it stop there?
On Tuesday Scottish Enterprise released the first details of its year-long
inquiry, with the Royal Society of Edinburgh, into the commercialisation of
Scottish science.
The picture Scottish Enterprise paints is of Scotland's 13 universities alive
with fruitful scientific inquiry but singularly failing to convert enough of
what is discovered into spin-off companies and jobs here in Scotland.
The problem is not that Scottish science is unproductive. As the inquiry report
shows, Scottish universities have a disproportionately large share of UK
academic science. Around 15% of all the higher degrees for example. In terms of
publications per researcher ``Scotland ranks third in the world, producing 50%
more papers than the United States''.
It's not even that Scotland's scientists are all hostile to commercialising
their work. Some 53% of Scottish academic scientists are currently working
closely with industry compared with 34% of scientists in American universities.
And yet, research for the inquiry has identified only 60 surviving spin-outs
from Scottish university science over the past 15 years, employing in total
just 1500 people. In contrast, a single Swedish university, Chalmers in
Gothenburg, can list 200 spin-outs currently employing 2700 people. MIT in
Massachusetts has spawned countless businesses employing 200,000 people.
Clearly Scottish science has a long way to go to realise its full potential in
the wider economy. Scottish Enterprise chief executive Crawford Beveridge rates
this challenge even more important than persuading more Scots to become
entrepreneurial and launch start-up businesses. But past under-performance in
unlocking what Beveridge calls ``the massive store of intellectual property in
our universities'' has complex roots which will be hard to unravel.
The UK funding community is notoriously risk averse when faced with hi-tech
proposals. University rules and regulations and the burden of administration
under which many academics labour hinder the spin-off process. Academic culture
rates an individual's publication history much more highly than commercial
ambition. Too few indigenous Scottish companies are big enough or sophisticated
enough to exploit the science which is on offer. And get academics to see that
they might be the wrong person to take their science to market is another
hurdle.
But, if nothing is done to ease these constraints, Scottish scientific
discoveries will continue to be exploited by others. The main wealth generated
and the jobs created will, for the most part, pass Scotland by. The next stage
of the inquiry promises an action plan. We certainly need action.
In terms of tomorrow's industries and jobs Scotland's public strategy in recent
years has been to tout for as big a share as we can get of investment from
elsewhere and, more recently through the business birthrate initiative, to
reawaken in more Scots the instinct to start businesses of their own.
Bidding for inward investment has always carried a price. Such is the
competition that that price is getting bigger. And the kind of investment that
tends to come - at the assembly end of the production chain - is vulnerable in
the medium term. The birthrate strategy is about changing fundamental
attitudes. That, by definition, is a very long game. So Scotland's economy
desperately needs additional targets. Exploiting more of our academic science
in the commercial arena deserves top priority.

IF I held shares in Forte I'd be voting to take the weight off my feet. An epic
city contest between the Forte family business and the hostile raiders of
Granada, the telly-to-tagliatelle conglomerate, is drawing up its battlelines,
and as regards taking sides it comes down to this: are you a happy eater or a
fast feeder? Do you like table service at your roadside restaurants or are you
a connoisseur of queues - a confident practitioner of the slick skills required
by self-assembly meals?
Forte liberated the peripatetic family from self-service stress by bringing us
Little Chefs and Happy Eaters; Granada lets the customer take the strain with
wobbling trays and instant decision-making. I know who I'm rooting for.
The self-service restaurant is one of the nastiest innovations of the twentieth
century. Its reductionist approach to eating - its uncouth dismantling of the
social and cultural rituals of sitting down to a meal - has proliferated more
enthusiastically in Britain than anywhere else, which says everything there is
to say about our attitudes to eating out.
The self-service restaurant exists grudgingly in continental Europe - in the
French motorway chain of Jacques Borel, in the student howffs of the Latin
Quarter, in the McDonald franchises of Berlin and Rome - but it thrives and
prospers in Britain. And even where it is not synonymous with portion control
and packet ketchup it signifies haste, discomfort, and agitation.
Its influence has spread far beyond the works canteen, the motorway, and the
shopping mall. It has dismally exceeded its original function of quick, cheap
catering for the hurrying hungry. Cheeseparing city councils and mean-spirited
cultural institutions (who see no connection between art and eating) invite the
public to serve themselves with vegetarian lasagne and boxed Chardonnay.
Decent food prepared in spectacular settings gets degraded by the queue, the
tray, the tables which are never cleared fast enough, the customer's desperate
memory-search. Cutlery? Napkins? Butter? Seasonings? ``I'm sorry, I'm not
jumping the queue, I'm just trying to get a roll.'' It turns a peaceful meal
into a rowdy initiative test.
Is the saving on waiting staff wages reflected in the prices of the fare? Not
noticeably; the coffee served at table in the Patisserie Florentin,
Stockbridge, costs much the same as the coffee collected at the counter of the
handsome Patio Restaurant in Edinburgh's botanic gardens. Innocents abroad seat
themselves at its outside tables, dreamily admire the frieze of Edinburgh's
skyline, await service. By the time they notice the crocodile inside they've
lost their appetite.
Where was the self-service restaurant invented? America, probably, but even
America pursues the concept more cautiously than Britain. Outside the orbit of
Big Mac and its clones the ``all-day breakfast'' and other all-day victuals -
the uninterrupted provision of inexpensive, quickly prepared food - is supplied
by the diner, where men and women of legendary temperament serve table. It's my
impression that the American diner was the model for Forte's Little Chef chain,
later complemented by Happy Eaters.
You enter. You are approached, and usually welcomed. ``Smoking or
non-smoking?'' You sit. The menu is before you, with its junior version. You
reflect, you discuss, you order. One Chef's Special, one Healthy Option, one
cheeseburger and chips, three rounds of toast (``Brown bread or white?''), tea
for two, and a chocolate milk shake. Over the years, up and down the miles from
Inverness to Peterborough, a route map of the Little Chef menu has been etched
on my palate.
Hearty food for three, cooked before our eyes and pleasantly served. Cost,
about #15. Grrr, Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, who has made the
amazing public statement that if he wins control of Forte he will reduce staff,
remove overheads, ``sweat the assets'', and raise prices. He has his sights on
the hotel group, the largest in the country, but his special interest in the
Happy Eaters and Little Chefs sounds sinister: ``The service at the sites is
bad in our view. The original concept still looks good but has not been kept up
to date. We would introduce fast food into these sites. We want commercial
relationships, such as Burger King, that give us a good return.''
Decoded, what does this mean? As one who is willing to bet she's had more hot
dinners at Little Chefs than Gerry Robinson, let me make an educated guess. In
the Granada school of restaurant criticism ``bad'' service is ``slow'' service,
as in table service; the kind of service which doesn't suit fast food, fast
turnover, and ``a good return''.
In fact, across the spectrum of Forte's interests, from its luxury hotels to
its roadside diners, Mr Robinson has found faults which lead me to only one
conclusion: Rocco Forte, who accepted control of the company from his
89-year-old father three years ago, has been serving the public too well. He
has been giving them value for money.
Now there's a novelty - a captain of a leading service industry whose
management has been serving customers more conscientiously than shareholders.
In the Granada chief's ledger, Forte has even been undercharging customers. If
Robinson gets his hands on the Posthouse hotel chain he plans to raise prices
by 20% to 25%.
Such cockiness. Besides its budget and middle-market hotel chains Forte owns
some of Europe's finest: the George V in Paris, the Ritz in Madrid, the Hotel
Eden in Rome, the Hyde Park in London. Granada's experience of managing hotels
runs to one themed enterprise and 20 motorway lodges.
Still, nothing much should surprise us in the service industries. A local
stooshie has broken out in Edinburgh, where some city centre pubs plan to
charge entrance fees of #10 on the key night of the city's five-day Hogmanay
holocaust. Any day now we expect Sainsbury's to instal turnstiles at its doors.

DOUBTLESS this is a strange position to take upon the question of drinking and
driving. But then it is based on a strange position anyway. For a start I don't
drive, neither do my brothers nor other immediate family, and the first time I
took a driving lesson I killed a dug. It was a wee dug of low intellect but
entitled to life I suppose and I can think of a few humans whose termination
would have seemed more appropriate than this cur.
At least the wee furry thing died outright - I was sufficiently an apprentice
driver to execute the animal painlessly. A more experienced driver would have
run over the dug with perhaps less cavalier aplomb and the wee beast would have
taken hours to croak it. In my case I was a rotten motorist and splattered the
wee thing all over the roadway in seconds.
As it happens I am a sentimental man and gret something rotten, which is what
the driving instructor did too because he was going to have to spend an hour in
the police station reporting the untimely demise of a wire-haired mongrel with
weeping puppies in the background. Thus I have never bothered my arse about
driving lessons ever since. Seems to me that dugs are better aff without me
really, and nowadays I permit taxis to speed me from point to point without a
dug on my conscience at that.
Now this is nothing about mutts, except drivers. Once again this year we have
the campaign agin the drunk-drivers. We run it every year, all throughout
Britain. The chief constables love it; gives them a chance to turn up in
uniforms with silver tabs, just as if they were real sojers, and pontificate to
us all. Chief constables are flanked by flunkeys who speak in the sort of grave
tones which they don't seem to possess when they are out of their minds at
Christmas parties run for polis by the gendarmes.
D'ye see, the polis get to run in all thae drink drivers, thousands, well,
hundreds, well a few, at Christmas time in a way they can't run in the bastards
who break into cars, let alone houses, all the year round. Oh, awffy easy to
pick up a drunk driver and even easier to challenge three zillion perfectly
respectable chaps of a night and discover that about 2% of those they would
practically wish to detain under the Terrorism Act have had a libation
consisting of about two gins with a mixer.
As it happens, far from reducing the permitted roughly-a-pint, or one Bacardi
for ladies, I would increase it. Few, if any, motorists ever stop at just one
pint. Don't tell me about no drink at all: that is a licence to lose it. If we
stay by sensible limits what I would do is increase the limit, and those above
it I would bloody well jail. I would organise city barracks for those above the
three-pint level or whatever in which they would have to spend all the next 12
months inside, and not at home for weekends, liberty extracted and their
misdemeanors made shamingly public.
Scottish Television ran a list of names and addresses (it was wee Denis Mooney,
subsequently of Scottish Action, who thought it up too), and very effective it
was. For years we have been operating a useless on-off switch whereby anybody
with a wee notch above the permitted level got a year's ban and so did the scum
who shoved a bottle of methyl alcohol down their damned throats and knowingly.
But we are not talking sense about alcohol and driving or Christmas and New
Year: we are not talking sense at all. We are talking prohibition. The nation
has went daft over prohibition in recent years. Some call it the nanny state,
and certainly in the matter of other's pleasures it seems so. But the past
months or so have seen the manifestation of the glories of the prohibition
stance.
Did you ever imagine anybody could start putting us all aware of the evils of
tobacco and beer in the wake of a few teenagers dying from ecstasy at dances or
heroin in the streets and saying that lager and Silk Cut are just as bad for
you? Behave yourselves. I doubt if any teenager in four centuries has croaked
it through shoving a can of superlager down his or her throat. Fags surely kill
but it takes a million or so of them over many a year. But we are in the age of
senseless prohibition.
Parisian authorities recently proposed a bye-law which would mean you couldn't
smoke a Gauloises in a pavement cafe. Dublin seems to think they might manage
legislation banning fags in pubs. Algeriques in Paris are bombing the Metro and
Dublin girls are leaving their shores daily for abortions in England and we are
worrying about cigarettes? I was reading Richard Gordon's Doctor books not so
long ago. Dating from the early 1950s they were. Awash with beer and whisky and
gin and fags. And fun. And common bloody sense too.

MANY motor clubs organise their rallies with eye-catching or fairly silly
titles. Within the last few weeks, East Ayrshire Car Club has run the
Mullwharchar Rally, named after a prominent hill south of Loch Doon, and
Lanarkshire Car Club members have been out on the Sir Walter. But the prize for
the most ingenious name goes to Le Jog, which runs from tomorrow until Tuesday.
Brainchild of John Brown, a rally navigator, co-driver and organiser of long
experience, Le Jog is an expression of the event's geographical limits. ``LE''
is Land's End and ``JOG'' represents John o'Groats, because we are talking
really big mileage here.
Its full title is The Land's End to John o'Groats Reliability Trial and Touring
Trial.
That longer-winded name identifies it as being outwith the usual run of modern
motor-sport. In fact, after two previous events, it has become one of the most
popular, as well as one of the most authentic, competition runs for historic
and classic cars.
The entry list of more than 120 cars and crews - most taking part in the main
event, the others in the more relaxed touring section - goes back into the
realms of Lanchester, Alvis, Jowett and Lea-Francis from earlier decades, as
well as Ford Cortinas, Sunbeam Rapiers, Volvo PV544s and Austin-Healey 3000s
from before the cut-off date in the 1970s.
Over the past few years there has been an upsurge of interest in historic
rallies, which are run all over the UK and Europe. Part of the appeal is
undoubtedly getting rally cars of the past back into action, but there is also
an element of being able to enjoy genuine competition driving without going
overboard in cost.
There are two main types of historic rally. One involves high-speed
special-stage action on privately owned, often forest roads. Some events of
this type stand on their own, while others are historic sections of rallies run
mainly for modern cars.
Le Jog is the other kind. As events like the Monte Carlo used to do, it
features long road sections with shorter regularity stretches where a precise
average speed has to be maintained to avoid penalty - for early or late arrival
- as well as manoeuvring tests on private ground.
It may sound a pushover, but an event like this, which runs from breakfast time
on Saturday until much the same time on Tuesday with just one overnight stop,
is no dawdle.
And while the drivers have to try their utmost on the manoeuvring tests,
drivers and navigators concentrate intensely on the regularity sections.
Keeping up an average speed of, say, 29mph seems ridiculously easy until you
try it, in the dark, on a freezing or fog-bound winter night, on a maze of
lanes in mid-Wales or over some hill road in the Highlands, perhaps in an
elderly car with no heater, vintage lights, heavy steering and only a draughty
hood for shelter.
Especially when being six seconds early at a check point is an even more
agonising failure for the crew involved than being eight seconds late.
There is a remarkable spread of entries for this year's event. They come from
all over the UK as well as from Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Finland, Germany and
Switzerland. And what cars! A 1924 Lanchester six-litre Tourer, vintage
Bentleys, a Brough Superior, a chain-drive Frazer Nash Nurburg, a Talbot 75, a
pair of Lagonda LG45s, one of the rare Rover-based Marauder sports cars of the
1950s, an Aston Martin and a Ford Thunderbird, Mini Coopers, Jaguars, MGBs, a
Rochdale Olympic, a Lancia Fulvia and Augusta, Porsches, even a Rolls-Royce
Silver Wraith.
Scottish-based entrants, on home ground from Bonchester Bridge on Sunday to the
finish at John o'Groats on Tuesday, include Branislav Sudjic in a 1927 Type 44
Bugatti, Sue Shoosmith in a 1926 Bentley, Fred Multon in an Austin-Healey 100/4
and Laurenc e Grainger in a Volvo 122S.
Old rally hands reading through the entry list will appreciate, from the names
of some of the navigators, that many of these crews are not out to finish
second. There is no rubbish about doing it just for fun.
Willy Cave, Don Barrow, Colin Francis and others were co-driving aces when
these cars were new. Barrow, for instance, was with Timo Makinen in a works
Austin-Healey 3000 when they finished second in the 1964 RAC Rally. He is
navigating another Healey this weekend and, although the pace may be different,
he will be taking things just about as seriously on Le Jog.
All in all, it is no place for the faint-hearted.

TAKEOVER prospects for the Royal Bank of Scotland should have faded after

million shares traded although as yet there are no names that raise any
eyebrows.
Unless any bidder was foreign, there would almost certainly be an automatic
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission as none of the conceivable
UK putative bidders such as BAT, NatWest, Prudential and more particularly and
potentially the most threatening, HSBC would raise competition conflicts.
But then it is difficult to see what any other financial institution would add
value as far as Royal shareholders are concerned given, that the Royal appears
to be operating more efficiently than any other UK bank apart from the Bank of
Scotland, which has only a handful of English branches and Abbey National -
although that still remains a building society in all but name, albeit livelier
than most of that herd.
At times, somewhat weary sighs are heard from one or two senior figures at the
Royal whenever Direct Line is mentioned - probably feeling that the tail is
wagging the dog.
But that insurance subsidiary is probably now the only substantial company in
the sector making money out of motor underwriting as the latest quarterly
figures from the composites begin to indicate.
And while profits for the current year may struggle to keep above #100m
(#112m), few other organisations could have maintained profits as Direct Line
did in the year to September when income was falling by 10% and will benefit
substantially when weaker competitors fail and the cycle moves upwards again.
However, the speculation will undoubtedly continue, but with the prospect of
current year profits reaching about #660m it would require a pretty pricey
offer to succeed.
Healthy 3i
THE economy may have turned down in the past few months, but earnings growth
has been impressive for many companies this year, which, in turn, has led to
generous dividend payouts. This strong corporate performance is reflected in
the healthy interim results from 3i.
Its quarterly Enterprise Barometer of small and medium-sized companies mirrors
trends seen in other economic surveys, namely a reduction in business
confidence in recent months. The Barometer Index remains positive but has
fallen to plus 17 from plus 45 in September.
Overall, companies continue to be confident about their own prospects in terms
of continued growth in turnover and profits. 3i's Chief executive, Ewen
McPherson, does not expect the Budget to have any impact on the outlook for
confidence.
The prospects for employment also appear to be better than the weaker GDP may
suggest. Over 60% of 3i companies surveyed expect to employ more people at the
end of this year compared to the end of last year.
In his Budget speech, the Chancellor praised the contribution that small and
medium-sized firms made to the economy.
Much of last year's strong growth in the UK economy was down to buoyant
exports. The proportion of 3i companies that export has been rising in recent
years: 63% of respondents export compared with 46% in April 1990.
France and Germany remain the dominant export markets. The 3i survey shows that
smaller companies are more likely to derive a higher proportion of their
turnover from exports. Manufacturing firms are also more likely to export.
Bid talks off
WELSH Water will have to go hostile if it wants to win Swalec following the
breakdown of talks between the two, and it is hard to see this being in the
interest of anyone.
The only rationale behind a hostile bid would be the savings available from a
merged company.
Swalec's claim that these would amount to only #11m annually is no doubt an
understatement and outsiders reckon they could amount to #30m-#35m, if all went
well.
This would arise from combining head offices, billing and computer systems, and
maintenance depots. There would also be major tax advantages in that Welsh
Water's accumulated advance corporation tax could be offset against Swalec's
profits.
But there could be heavy costs in implementing a merger, particularly in the
computing field where the companies use different systems. The reduction in
Swalec's workforce since privatisation has been achieved through a voluntary
scheme which was popular as a result of the age structure of the workforce. The
easy cuts have been achieved.
Further reductions would probably involve compulsory redundancies which, apart
from alienating employees, could also upset customers. They could well resent
their local utilities slugging it out in a no-holds barred takeover battle.
Welsh Water's lamentable diversification record does not inspire confidence in
its ability to manage a major merger. It can hardly tell Swalec how to run its
business better as the electricity distributor's track record shows it has
sound management who are already running a tight ship.
Rather that going through the huge cost in legal and professional fees of a
contested takeover bid, shareholders of both companies would do better from
co-operation agreements which could result in lower costs in various areas such
as depots and even billing systems.

BARRIE Holder, deputy chief executive and finance director of General Accident,
died suddenly yesterday during a visit to London.
A spokesman for the Perth-based insurance company said he believed Mr Holder,
who was aged 50, had suffered a heart attack.
Mr Holder was responsible for finance, investment and life assurance at General
Accident and pushed through its #170m takeover of Provident Mutual earlier this
year.
Originally from Yorkshire, he was a rising star with the company. He was
appointed general manager and a member of the board in 1990 and was promoted to
deputy chief executive last year.
General Accident chief executive Nelson Robertson is due to retire at the end
of this year to be replaced by Bob Scott, the company's other deputy chief
executive.

THE Bundesbank has dashed hopes of pre-Christmas cuts in interest rates around
the globe to boost the flagging economies of the major industrial nations.
The German central bank left its discount and Lombard rates unchanged after its
council meeting, frustrating hopes of an easing of monetary policy.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, would now have to act
unilaterally at his meeting with the Governor of the Bank of England on
December 13 if he decided to satisfy demands for lower interest rates at home.
The Bundesbank council meets again the day after.
Earlier Mr George adopted a cautious attitude on rates. He described the
Chancellor's Budget as ``very sensible'', but added, ``We shall have to wait
and see,'' if it would create the scope for a change in monetary policy. ``A
lot of factors go into that sort of decision.''
Sterling, which has lost ground since the Budget, rallied slightly after the
Bundesbank stayed its hand. On Wednesday Mr Clarke said that he would not play
fast and loose with interest rates in response to political pressures. Last
night it looked unlikely that he would take the risk.
The Bundesbank's official discount rate was held at 3.5% and the Lombard
emergency financing rate at 5.5%, both unchanged since late August.
There had been strong speculation before the meeting that the time was ripe for
the German central bank to cut key rates for the first time in three months to
kick-start a sluggish economy.
German inflation is 1.5% and the money supply is sluggish with the economy
slowing down. A cut in German rates had been expected to spark off a round of
rate reductions on the Continent.
``They could have done it if they had wanted to and they could have justified a
move,'' said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt.
``I think they will seek to keep rate cut hopes alive for the next month or two
before making a move,'' he added. He said the next official rate cut was most
likely to come in mid-January.
But economists noted the Bundesbank still had scope to ease its main money
market rate in coming weeks and was under no pressure to deliver an official
rate cut.
The securities repurchase rate or repo rate could still ease by about 20 basis
points before it bumped into the discount rate, they said.
The Bundesbank had unexpectedly raised its key money market rate on Wednesday
by one basis point to 3.98%, but economists had said the rise -the first in
three years - did not preclude a further cut in official rates.
The rise in the repo rate, was due to technical market factors and not a change
in policy, according to Bundesbank watchers.

New York close: # = $1.5319
New York, Thursday - Blue-chip stocks closed sharply lower on profit-taking as
investors called a time-out after the market racked up six straight sessions of
record highs.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended 31.07 lower at 5074.49, retreating from
yesterday's record high of 5105.56.
Analysts said economic data released this morning pointed to slow growth in the
economy, bolstering hopes of a possible interest rate cut as early as December.
October US durable goods orders slipped by 1% and the Chicagoland Business
Barometer fell to 49.9 in November from 53.4 in October.
``We have a very overbought market in the Dow,'' said Paul Rabbitt, senior
quantitative analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. But he said underlying market
strength was limiting the weakness in stock prices.
``The market is overbought but it has to be viewed in a context. There is
momentum,'' Rabbitt said. ``I think the momentum will carry the market by
bumping the trading ranges higher.''
Retailers reported that November same-store sales were disappointing.
``Retail sales are a little on the soft side,'' said Philip Orlando, chief
investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. ``The scarier point is that
for them to get those weak sales they had to have a heavy promotion already in
season.''
He expects this Christmas to be the worst holiday season for retailers this
decade. ``Retail sales this morning support my theory,'' he said.

LONDON International Group, the world's largest manufacturer of condoms, is
launching its Durex brand on the internet computer network as part of an
``on-going'' initiative to globalise the condom brand.
The company says the new site will also promote `safe surfing' on the internet
by providing tips on condoms, romance and safe sex for those exploring the
on-line world.
Unveiling a rise in pre-tax profits from #1m to #6.5m for the six months to
September 30 as it continues to recover from its 1993 slump, LIG also signalled
its intention to increase its share of the market with the purchase of the
`Mister' condom brand in South East Asia for #2m, its first condom
manufacturing purchase for many years. Mister is the long established brand
leader with 40% of the fast growing Malaysian market. With Durex the number two
brand, LIG will control around 70% of this market.
Chief executive Nick Hodges said, ``Together with market leadership in Hong
Kong, Thailand and Singapore, our strength and position in Malaysia provides us
with a strong platform for growth in these and other markets in South East
Asia.''
In the US, Avanti, the group's polyurethane condom, has retained its 3% market
share by value in the 13 western states and current clinical and pricing trials
are expected to be completed by 1996. This will be followed by a US national
launch at a substantially increased price. LIG says it remains positive about
the long-term potential of Avanti as a high priced niche product.
Meanwhile, the group's ``encouraging performance'' has meant a resumption of
payment of an interim dividend, with shareholders receiving 0.5p against
nothing last time. Earnings per share rose from 0.32p to 1.43p.
Sales of the health and personal products business were up 7.3% to #139.5m,
with core products, condoms, surgical and specialist gloves achieving
underlying growth of 13.8% after adjustments for currency movements, brand
disposals and promotional smoothing.
LIG says it is on track to meet its goals even though further rationalisation
will be needed. ``We are on track to meet our goals and budgets for the year,
our second-half is traditionally a stronger trading period for the group,''
said chairman Michael Moore.
The firm is continuing to pursue a divestment strategy of brands which do not
support core business and for which satisfactory prices can be obtained.

SCOTTISH Radio Holdings, Scotland's largest commercial radio group, wants to
extend its growing media empire to the Irish Republic.
The Glasgow-based company is leading a consortium which will submit an
application in Dublin today for the Irish national radio licence to run an FM
station covering the entire country.
The move comes as Scottish Radio unveils record profit of #5.1m, up 22% in the
year to September 30 on turnover up 9% at #17.2m.
Finance director Jim Bowman said the company hopes to hear the result of the
Irish licence application before its annual meeting on February 15.
He declined to give further details about the project, which represents
Scottish Radio's second foray across the Irish Sea.
Last month Scottish Radio purchased the Morton group of weekly newspapers in
Northern Ireland for #11.2m, setting the stage for the development of a more
diversified media business.
Once the Morton purchase has been digested, Scottish Radio plans to buy more
weeklies in the UK or Eire, but Mr Bowman said the group would continue its
tradition of making amicable, not hostile purchases.
This policy enables Scottish Radio to make purchases by issuing more of its own
shares as well as by paying cash.
The company operates Radio Clyde, Radio Forth, Radio Tay and Northsound in
Scotland and claims that all these stations are market leaders in their own
area.
Local advertising revenue grew at a steady 6% last year, while national
advertising, booked through its London sales house SIRS, soared 22%.
A final payout of 4.4p raised the full-year dividend by 20% to 6.5p and
Scottish Radio shares gained 2p to 312p.
The company has made a good start to the current financial year, with broadcast
revenue rising 7% in October and November. Chairman Ian Chapman said he was
``confident of the medium and long-term prospects''.
Scottish Radio's two new Irish ventures reflect its deliberate attempt to break
out of a cramped radio environment in Scotland where there is little room to
grow further.
``Any expansion that we might contemplate in commercial radio would not be in
Scotland, where there is nothing significant left to go for,'' Mr Bowman said.
Scottish Radio had a 40% stake in West Cumbria Radio, which began broadcasting
to the Workington and Whitehaven areas in September and Mr Bowman said it is
now interested in the regional radio licences for Yorkshire and East Anglia,
which will be offered in 1966.
The finance director said Scottish Radio plans to apply its expertise gained in
local radio to local newspapers.
But this will be in partnership with Charles Villiers, the architect of the
Morton purchase, who has been appointed chief executive of the company's SCORE
Press newspaper division.
The company had #8.2m of cash and no debt at the end of September. But Mr
Bowman said it would borrow money to expand if this seemed appropriate.

UNLIKE some historic events, Le Jog welcomes spectators at controls and test
locations.
The first main time control in Scotland is the Horse and Hounds at Bonchester
Bridge on the A68, where the first car should arrive around 15.20 on Sunday.
The route then goes by way of Darnick and Stow to the overnight stop at the
Royal Scot Hotel on the west side of Edinburgh from 18.00.
After the only night stop on the event, the restart from the Royal Scot is at
07.15 on Monday. Competitors head for a test at Knockhill opening at 08.00,
then bypass Gleneagles Hotel on the way via Comrie and Lochearnhead to a main
control at Killin around 10.00.
Fortingall and Pitlochry are on the route to another main control at the
Dalrulzion Hotel, Glenshee, from 12.30. Edzell at 14.25 is on the way to a test
on the sprint course beside the Grampian Transport Museum at Alford from 15.30.
A route check at the Glen Avon Hotel in Tomintoul leads to another main control
at the Garth Hotel, Grantown-on-Spey, then a main control and dinner halt at
the Thistle Hotel, Inverness.
Down to Dores for 22.10, cars should be at Inverfarigaig from 22.30, then go
into Tuesday for another main control at the Lady Ross Cafe in Ardgay from
02.00.
Golspie at 02.45 offers a refuelling stop at the Sutherland Arms, and then
there is an early breakfast halt at Tongue Hotel from 05.45. The final stretch
takes the surviving cars to John o'Groats from 09.25, at the end of what the
crews will have found a memorable adventure - when they look back on it!

TALKS between Welsh Water and Swalec - South Wales Electricity - broke down
yesterday afternoon, with the latter saying that the proposed cash and shares
offer - worth 916p per share excluding the rights to National Grid shares -
undervalued the company, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
``We are fed up that Welsh Water has now dithered for over three weeks without
tabling an acceptable offer,'' declared Andrew Walker, Swalec chief executive.
Mr Walker's hand was strengthened by good results from his company yesterday.
First half figures showed profits some 12% higher at #60.4m and the interim
dividend 5p up at 16p plus a special 100p extra payment.
Swalec is prepared to resume talking with Welsh Water but if the group insists
on going ahead with a contested bid, Mr Walker promised more for shareholders.
``You can be sure we have more powder in our locker,'' he declared. But he
added: ``We're not a scorched-earth kind of company.''
This was a reference to the defence package put forward by Northern Electricity
which left it with heavy gearing. The extra dividend is instead of another
buy-back of shares which the group had considered earlier. It has had
indications that shareholders preferred this. The move will raise gearing to
60% at the year-end, leaving scope for a further defensive cash payout.
Swalec's profits gain stems from a 21% drop in costs in real terms from a year
ago which more than offset a sharp fall in revenues from the regulated
activity. The group is more than halfway towards its target of cutting costs by
#45m a year. Manpower has come down by 30% in four and-a-half years.
In domestic supply margins improved sharply under more focused management and
lower bad debts with profits up from #5.5m to #9.8m.
The non-regulated interests include a joint venture cable operation which
continues its build-out with encouraging levels of connections.
There is also a contracting business which returned to profits after
restructuring. Swalec shares closed 24p up at 1113p while Welsh Water eased 7p
to 689p.
n.SOUTH West Water's profits were up 7% to #54m for the six months to September
on turnover 8% ahead at #155m. The interim dividend is raised 8% to 9.8p.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's plans to send around 20,000 troops to join a Nato
peacekeeping force in Bosnia received a crucial boost tonight when Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole said he would support the move.
Plans for the 60,000 Nato troops to police the peace in the Balkans began to
take definite shape tonight as Alliance ambassadors met in Brussels and the US
Congress began debating its proposed contingent.
``This is a very important time in American history. This is a very important
commitment the president has made. We wish he had listened to us (and lifted
the arms embargo on Bosnia long ago),'' Dole told the Senate.
He said he was preparing a resolution of approval, with provisions to protect
the troops and get them out in one year, for Congress's action late next week
or the following week.
The Clinton administration had spent the day lobbying Congressmen to back the
President's decision to commit US troops to oversee the Bosnian peace deal
struck last week in Dayton, Ohio.
Defence Secretary William Perry, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went before
Congress seeking its support to deploy US soldiers, although President Clinton,
their commander-in-chief, says he does not legally need it.
Without Nato intervention, Perry said, the war that claimed an estimated
250,000 lives would erupt again. ``The United States is the only nation that
can lead that force to success,'' he warned.
In New York, the United Nations Security Council tonight voted unanimously to
pull its blue-helmets out of Bosnia by the end of January - so making way for
the Nato force.
The Security Council decided to end its 40-month-old operation in Bosnia on
January 31.
Then, in two consecutive meetings, the council also voted to renew its mission
in Macedonia for six months and extend its operation in Croatia until January
15.
Nato policymakers met in the Belgian capital today to hammer out details for
the embarkation of an advance party of some 2600 elite troops next week.
The rest of the troops are due to start moving in shortly after the deal is
signed in Paris on December 14.
The Brussels session of the North Atlantic Council broke up tonight without
granting official authorisation. It was to meet again tomorrow to resume
discussions.
While the US Congress and the US public remain deeply divided over whether to
send American troops to Bosnia, the first American service personnel arrived
openly in the war-torn republic to scout the terrain today.
Ten US army and a similar number of air force members were in the Bosnian
government-controlled town of Tuzla to inspect their future command post for
the north-east sector and its huge airstrip.
Their open presence contrasts with secret visits by survey teams just before
and just after agreement on the Bosnia peace deal was reached in Dayton.

THE Latin Lover is alive and well in Italy where an opinion poll released
yesterday found two out of three married men had cheated on their wives.
Half of the all-male respondents said marital indiscretions were a ``natural
tendency'' and a large majority said adultery by men should never or almost
never be a reason for divorce.
A poll for the Federation of Italian Psychologists interviewed 960 men. Of the
married men, 67.3% said they had committed adultery - 55% once, and 52% two to
five times.
``For Italian men, only adultery by married women is a taboo,'' said the
federation.
Unmarried MP Vittorio Sgarbi said: ``Whoever has only one lifelong partner is
mentally unbalanced. Cheating does you good, it cures boredom and
unhappiness.''            -Reuter.

n HOWEVER they fared with the Chancellor this week, home owners with central
heating can budget for big savings through the latest technology.
The Government-backed Energy Saving Trust reckons a third could be lopped off
the average yearly gas bill of #600 by switching to a condensing boiler, which
ensures peak performance by harnessing some of the heat wasted by older
appliances.
The new boilers could pay for themselves within five years - more quickly if,
as some experts predict, fuel prices take off by the turn of the century.
For an information pack, and details of a special #100 promotion, phone energy

Ticket to ride
n NEARLY every bus and rail ticket ever produced says it somewhere: ``Not
transferable''. But ScotRail has signalled a change with a ticket that can be
transferred with their wholehearted endorsement.
The Flex-Pass provides 50 queue-free, cash-saving journeys between Glasgow and
Edinburgh and comes in book form. Users simply fill in the appropriate journey
date for travel in either direction. The ticket is valid until April 30 - first
class costs #420, the standard ticket #270, equal to 10% off peak-time fares.

THE British people have been witness this week to the awesome and overblown
mechanism of an American president. The phenomenon is akin to Queen Elizabeth
I, who used to bankrupt her less favoured subjects by staying with them. All
those hangers-on, all that electronic equipment, the huge cars, all that excess
of preparation, and overwhelming media presence.
Like the Tudors, American presidents maintain their authority by demonstrating
it. Bill Clinton, following his predecessors' example, has fallen back on the
trials and triumphs of foreign policy to get him over a tough time at home.
It's not to be sneezed at. For his first two years, Clinton ignored foreign
affairs, and there was no leadership in the world. He has now rediscovered the
power of the presidency.
All the progress that has been made on the Northern Ireland question has been
due to American prodding, including Tuesday's sudden agreement between Major
and Bruton. The Dayton treaty was only possible because the Americans pushed
for it.
Under the American Constitution, that means the president pushing.
In fact, this has been a good period for Clinton. In one week there was the
Bosnia agreement, the reopening, largely on his terms, of the federal
government after the Republicans had shut it down, and now the agreement
between London and Dublin, concocted at the last moment before the president
arrived.
But don't be misled. It could all fall apart, and the most brilliant success
abroad does not translate into solid votes at home. Jimmy Carter brought about
peace between Israel and Egypt, and George Bush won a spectacular war in the
Middle East. They were both thrown out on their necks at the next elections,
like a couple of latter-day Churchills. If Clinton wins next year, it will be
because of the weakness of the opposition candidate, or candidates, not through
his own merits or his foreign triumphs.
He was elected three years ago and it is now possible to run up a tally-sheet
of his presidency. He has proved a dud president, like so many of his
predecessors, and these few foreign successes don't alter that - and new,
spectacular failures won't make it any worse.
It is entirely possible that he will win the next presidential election while
the Republicans keep their majorities in both houses of Congress, and so the
gridlock will continue for another four years.
Now that the boot is on the other foot, Democrats can rejoice at gridlock,
because it prevents Newt Gingrich and his merry men wreaking total havoc on the
welfare system, the environment and the principle of progressive taxation.
This is not all the result of America's inadequate institutions: Clinton has
played a large part in grinding down his own presidency. Even more important
has been the general decline of the Democratic Party over the past 20 years.
Successful presidents have either swept into town on huge majorities, carrying
Congress with them, or they have been adept at manipulating Congressional
politics, or they have been particularly attuned to the zeitgeist.
The greatest, Franklin Roosevelt for instance, have been all three. Lyndon
Johnson had both a huge majority, after the 1964 election, and unrivalled skill
at managing Congress. He got the zeitgeist wrong, and it destroyed him.
Ronald Reagan caught the spirit of the times, and though his conservative
policies ran into the sands after a couple of years (that often happens), he
was always able to tell Americans what they wanted to hear, and so remained a
popular and effective president to the end.
Clinton, like Ford, Carter and Bush, to go no farther back, never had a
majority to support him in Congress, has shown minimal skill at playing off the
various factions and individuals in Congress against each other, and, as for
the zeitgeist, he hasn't a clue.
He has nothing much to show for his first three years, except that at last he
seems to have discovered a recipe for thwarting the Republicans and hanging on
to enough public support to stand a good chance of victory next year.
All he has to do is to point out that the Republicans, despite their laudable
desire to balance the budget and reform the welfare system, are in fact the
party of the rich, white suburbs and are also in thrall to business interests
who want to wind up the past decades' victories on the environment,
occupational safety, and land policy.
Industries that object to the clean air laws, for instance, have bought
Republican support in the old-fashioned way, with money. The party's official
position now is that the laws have worked, the air is clean, so we don't need
the laws any more.
Rather belatedly, the party has discovered a huge majority of Americans
actually approve of the environmental protection laws.
To cap it all, their chief spokesman, Newt Gingrich, is a stridently unpleasant
man. Clinton will run against him, no matter whom the Republicans nominate for
president.
This is a far cry from the high hopes Democrats felt after they won the 1992
election, only their second win in 24 years.
They expected a leader who would revitalise the party, give it a new sense of
direction, or at the very least establish it firmly and unassailably in the
centre of the political field.
Clinton failed on all counts. The best he and his party can now hope for is to
block the Republican revolution, a negative ambition and a sign the Democrats
are really brain dead.
But it must be said, as we saw in London and Ireland this week, that Clinton
carries off the business of travelling president very well. America, and its
president, have still a role to play in the world, even if they can't get their
act together at home.

WHEN Asda executives take the train on business, they travel second class.
``Have done for some time,'' cheerfully asserts PR manager Jeni Cropper,
describing how the Asda culture of saving money extends to recycling envelopes
and eating sandwiches rather than business lunches.
The past three years have seen the company opening a store in Cumbernauld the
week before last and another in Govan this month, making a triumphant return to
its cost-cutting roots.
Savage attacks on the price of books and pharmaceuticals have been allied to a
reconstruction of Asda's management and staff morale, plus a stream of bright
ideas in-store that make its three main competitors Safeway, Sainsbury's and,
possibly, Tesco often look simply tired.
If Asda is doing so well, say insiders (outperforming predictions on shares,
sales and customer numbers, high public profile thanks to the Asda Difference
TV advertising campaign) it is because it dominates the only area left for
increasingly sophisticated and similar supermarkets to exploit. The superstore
wars of the late nineties will be fought on customer service.
In the eighties, says Paul Smiddy, retail analyst with Credit Lyonnais Laing,
supermarkets fought each other on the design of the stores and the development
of own-label brands. In the early nineties the emphasis shifted to price, but
the arrival of continental discount stores such as Aldi and Netto meant someone
could alway sell it to you cheaper, even if it was straight out of the
cardboard box.
The mid-nineties found the big four supermarkets, knowing there was only so
much money to be made on food, established in retail parks on the outskirts of
towns with a raft of newly-built stores offering many High Street services;
pharmacies, post offices, dry cleaning, petrol, with the extras such as coffee
shops and baby changing rooms the customers were beginning to take for granted.
Although the big four will each target a certain sort of customer - Asda will
always attract lower earners than Sainsbury's, with its traditional emphasis on
quality and its glossy magazine snob value - this leaves customer service as
the only new way superstores can outpace the competition.
Safeway, whose parent company Argyll this week announced a steep share rise
after strong sales took the city by surprise, has advertised heavily its
customer services through the popular Harry toddler in the trolley campaign.
But for years, customer service was not the most important part of the
supermarket package. In fact, the introduction of bar-reading checkouts was
designed to shove more people through the tills quicker. Smiddy points to
Sainsbury's, for 10 years the acknowledged market leader by focusing on the
``mechanistic'' side of shopping, such as improving store hygiene, increasing
stock and making more trolleys available. This was at the expense of ``softer''
services (the company itself, in its interim results announcement on November
1, admitted it was seeking ``a warmer, less clinical image for Sainsbury's'').
It thereby allowed Tesco to clean up when that store introduced the important
``one in front'' queue system in 1993, ensuring no more than one customer was
waiting for a till at a time.
This, together with the increasing numbers of packers on the tills, shows how
retailers are focusing on the ``front end'' of the supermarket experience -
quality, freshness and a wide stock are now pretty much the same throughout the
big four, so it's the people on the tills who make the difference.
Sainsbury's eventually copied ``one in front'', but made the mistake of
advertising the service. It was forced to pull the advert when people
complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the extra tills did not
open up when required, demonstrating the danger of making promises you can't
keep.
Tesco's other strength is its loyalty discount Clubcard, which already has
6,000,000 holders, indicating the scale of market share the superstores are
fighting for. City analysts put Argyll's strong showing this week down to its
ABC loyalty card, introduced late in the game but now taking off rapidly.
A loyal customer, Smiddy estimates, ``could provide #200,000 in sales to a
supermarket chain over his or her lifetime''. This is the equivalent of #20,000
in net profits. Sainsbury's was wrong-footed again on this one, initially
discounting the benefits of loyalty cards before belatedly introducing them to
hundreds of stores.
What characterises Asda and Tesco, says Smiddy, is an enterprise culture within
the stores themselves. He says Sainsbury's has traditionally favoured a
hierarchical management structure, while Tesco managers have more freedom to
try out their own ideas.
And at Asda, since the arrival of chief executive Archie Norman four years ago,
the whole staff has been involved in running the company.
Norman, a Harvard business graduate in his early forties who in his spare time
runs a small family farm in Argyll, was headhunted to run a company in deep
trouble.
Asda's roots are on the outskirts of Leeds, where in 1965 a consortium of West
Yorkshire dairymen and butchers opened the first of a rapidly growing chain of
``pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap'' stores for their products.
Throughout the seventies and eighties Asda expanded, opening its first Scottish
store in Edinburgh in 1972 (there are 28 in Scotland today, around 205
nationwide).
But in the late eighties, Asda acquired 69 Gateway stores, and with them a huge
and unmanageable debt. ``Asda Price'' became a thing of the past and the
company found itself with a stable of downmarket stores with a reputation to
match.
Norman changed everything. He brought in a team of young MBA business people
like himself, put new managers in nearly every store and launched a
``three-year plan'' of recovery which has just ended.
Asda stores are about 60% larger than the competition's, so Norman could offer
every in-store service available. The company thus has more petrol stations,
pharmacies, dry-cleaning shops, coffee shops and creches than anyone else.
Not content with having ``more bakeries baking fresh bread from scratch than
anybody else,'' according Jeni Cropper, the company also opened them up to the
public, who can now talk to the bakers as they work. Similar plans are afoot
for the butcheries.
Price is paramount. October's Food Retailing Survey from analysts Verdict
priced the Asda basket of groceries lower than any of its competitors. The
company recently succeeded in smashing the Net Book Agreement where booksellers
such as Dillons had failed, with the result that 30% of UK sales of John Le
Carre's Our Game were made in Asda, which is engaging in the same battle with
dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals - possibly with an eye on eventually
discounting NHS prescriptions.
The company recognises the threat to smaller retailers such buying power
represents, but, says Cropper: ``There's always a specialist route (for them)
to go down. Sixty per cent of people, up to recently, never went into a
bookshop. We have opened up lines to people who never bought books.
``We are aggressive. We are determined to give our shoppers the best value.''
The company recently bought the firm producing its highly successful George
line of clothing - to make him ``one of the Asda family then, properly'', says
Cropper.
Staff, in company literature, are known as ``colleagues''. ``In the company
there's a great feeling that nobody's more important than anybody else.''
At recruitment, staff are screened for their ``customer-friendly'' potential in
heavily-weighted questions on the application form and during the interview, a
more sophisticated process than any of its rivals.
Once on board, the Tell Archie scheme encourages the 69,000 staff to contact
Norman directly with their ideas; he receives some 500 a month. They are
allowed space in store to promote a line or an idea they think will sell, and
benefit from a share ownership plan and individual and storewide customer
service awards. Sainsbury's pioneered profit sharing, but has no store-based
incentive scheme; the same is true of Tesco, and Safeway shopfloor staff have
no effective bonus system.
In contrast, Asda staff are paid less than their top three competitors - around
#3.67 per hour, against Tesco's #4.26 - and recently saw their double time for
Sunday working cut to time and a half.
This may not be a negative, says Paul Smiddy of Credit Lyonnais; apart from
demonstrating that Sunday working, inevitably, is becoming an accepted part of
normal employment conditions, it means the company - where, remember, even the
executives travel second class - can therefore afford to employ part-time
workers for longer hours, giving them a greater share in the all-powerful
``Asda family''.

Larnaca, Thursday
A COURT in Cyprus today rejected a British soldier's attempt to suppress a
statement in which he allegedly accused a fellow soldier of killing a young
Danish woman.
Private Jeff Parnell, 23, of Oldbury, West Midlands, made the statement nine
hours after he and two other soldiers were arrested for the murder last year of
23-year-old tour guide Louise Jensen.
The three soldiers, based at Dhekelia, are on trial for manslaughter,
abduction, and conspiracy to rape.
``Alan did it,'' Parnell is alleged to have said, referring to Private Alan
Ford, 27, of Birmingham. The third accused is Private Justin Fowler, also 27,
of Falmouth, Cornwall.
Parnell's lawyer argued that, as Parnell was drunk and tired when he made the
statement, it be ruled inadmissible. However Judge Takis Eliades replied: ``The
tiredness he was feeling was natural and it can't be said that it was to such
an extent that his freedom of judgment was affected.'' The hearing
continues.-AP.

DUNDEE Football Club has been sold by the Canadian who has owned the Dens Park
side for almost five years.
It is believed Mr Ron Dixon, who is based in Vancouver, decided to announce the
#3m deal only after learning The Herald had divulged the imminent sale
yesterday.
After being told of The Herald story, he promised an official statement by late
afternoon.
It revealed Mr Dixon was giving up control and that his vice-chairman, Mr
Malcolm Reid, a local businessman, and player manager Jim Duffy were part of
the take-over group.
They will be supported in the move by two wealthy, and as yet unnamed
Dundonians. The money will be paid to Mr Dixon over the next five years.
The initial asking price of #2.2m had not included the Dens Park stadium in the
deal, but that has now become part of the package, boosting the price to #3m.
Mr Dixon, who also stated that Mr Duffy could eventually become chairman of the
Tayside club, bought the club for #600,000 then kept it afloat with an interest
free personal loan of another #1.5m.

POLICE yesterday warned motorists to expect a morning-after clampdown during
the festive season drink-driving campaign, the first week of which ends today.
Strathclyde and Central forces confirmed that extra road-checks had been
arranged to target morning commuters. In Lothian and Borders, with no specific
morning clampdown, initial impressions suggested an increase in motorists being
caught at that time of day.

POLICE investigating the death of a Caithness man, Mr Gordon Miller, 36, whose
body was found naked and battered in Liverpool on Monday, have arrested a
16-year-old youth and a man of 22.

THIEVES who broke into Phillips Auctioneers, in George Street, Edinburgh, stole

Bugging error
LOTHIAN and Borders police said yesterday that one of their own employees
inadvertently bugged the control room in their Edinburgh HQ. A statement said
they believed there had been no breach of security from the device, in a plug
adaptor.
Village facelift
THE Loch Lomond village of Balloch is to have a #300,000 facelift. Dumbarton
Council plans environmental improvements at the Moss o' Balloch car parks and
the River Leven slipway - despite objections from some villagers.
Flat siege ends
A SIEGE at a flat in Rhyl, North Wales, ended peacefully yesterday after more

THE Archbishop of Canterbury is upset that a report from a Church of England
committee has suggested ``living in sin'' is not actually a sin. George Carey
roundly denounced the implication that no single form of the family was a
God-given ideal.
Religion has always been about sex, though once it was about everything. The
earliest European visitors to Australia reported back that the natives had no
religion. Because the aborigines did not distinguish the natural and
supernatural worlds in the way we did, because they did not have special
buildings for worship, the blinkered visitors missed the all-pervasive nature
of their spirituality.
The evolution of human culture has seen the shrinking of religion. The
Christian Church of the Middle Ages tried to dominate every aspect of life;
even such economic activity as the pricing of bread was thought a fitting
matter for church courts.
One of the few areas of life the churches have tried to keep in their grasp is
sexual reproduction. An institution which wishes to address the entire human
condition must have something to say about how life begins. The Genesis story
of Adam and Eve comes at the start of the Bible. When it has lost everything
else, religion will still try to tell us how to engage in sex and how to
reproduce the species.
For centuries the Christian Church had a more mundane reason for trying to keep
a grip on our private parts. Understanding that allows us to see why the grip
has become arthritic. In the feudal world, social and political power derived
from positions in a fixed hierarchy and those positions were inherited. The
Stewarts were so-called because their family held the hereditary office of
``steward'' to the king. Aberdeen's Marischal College was named after its
founder and benefactor, the Earl of Keith, the hereditary ``marshall'' of
Scotland.
The most important productive asset - land - was inherited. Where the rules say
the wealth of one generation should pass to the rightful heir in the next
generation, identifying the rightful heir was a serious matter.
Rich and powerful people, if rich and powerful enough, might reward their
bastards, but there was still an enormous difference between the rights of the
legitimate heir and the claims of illegitimate offspring. Where so much
depended on the legal relationship of the sperm and the egg, the Church's work
in giving supernatural justification to marriage rules, and policing the
observance of these rules, was actively supported by the rich and powerful.
The poor were always less easily persuaded. Church records of every epoch show
fornication and pregnancy outside of wedlock to be popular offences. Even when
almost everyone belonged to the same Church, it was impossible to prevent
promiscuity. When, after the Reformation, the great national Churches
fragmented into competing sects, it was all that much easier for people to
evade religious sanctions.
Industrial production displaced agriculture. The joint stock company freed
manufacturing enterprises from their dependence on the personal fortunes of the
owner. Political power shifted to assemblies of elected individuals.
Inheritance ceased to sit at the core of our economy or polity. Just which side
of the blanket someone was born on was reduced to a purely cultural matter. And
from there it was a short step to not mattering at all.
What is more revealing about the Church of England's predicament than the
headline story is a sub-text buried in George Carey's argument that ``marriage,
not cohabitation, is the institution which is at the heart of the good
society''. Here marriage is not defended on the grounds that it is divinely
ordained and that those who break divine ordinances will be punished with
eternal damnation.
Rather, it is advertised for its social benefits. Marriage is good for a
society. Perhaps it is. Perhaps any sensible Government should arrange social
policy to buttress such a useful institution. But to abandon the highest ground
of divine ordinance and to rest the legitimacy of marriage on its social
functions is to invite argument and neglect: argument because we can reasonably
disagree over just how functional is the traditional marriage; neglect because,
however concerned we may be in the abstract about the health of our society,
most of us make decisions on the basis of personal interest.
However, we can readily see why the Archbishop has to offer functional
arguments instead of prophetic denunciation. Less than three-quarters of us
even claim to believe in ``God''. Half of that number think of the divinity as
some vague ``higher power'' rather than as a personal deity with strong and
clear ethical standards. Less than a quarter of us claim to believe in hell.
Deprived of those weapons, the writ of modern Church leaders runs very small.
Of all the Christian Churches the Roman Catholic is closest to the medieval
Church in the claims it makes for its own authority. It has taken a clear
distinctive position on matters of sexual morality. Yet, as we see from the
incontestable fact that Catholic birth rates are the same as those for
non-Catholics of the same social class, it could be argued that even committed
church-going Catholics do not follow the teachings of their Church on
artificial contraception.
If the Pope cannot control his own followers, what hope have the bishops of the
Church of England got of influencing the sexual behaviour of the 90% of the
population who very rarely enter any place of worship?

Nablus, West Bank, Thursday
ISRAELI troops wounded 18 Arabs in Nablus today in a day of violence in which
two Israelis were also wounded by gunfire on a bus escorted by army jeeps.
Nablus residents took to the streets to commemorate the sixth anniversary of
the killing by Israeli troops of four Fatah Black Panther leaders.
Witnesses said youths, disdaining Israeli fire, stood in full view on rooftops
and hurled concrete blocks and large stones at troops. Protesters commandeered
trucks to use as barricades.
Demonstrators screamed at the Israeli troops ``Get out, maniacs'' and
``Occupation must end''.
Medical sources at Nablus's Rafidiyeh hospital said 18 people aged 20 to 35
were hurt, two of them seriously by gunshot wounds. Some were wounded by rubber
bullets.
Nablus district, with a population of 500,000, is to be the third Palestinian
area to be handed over to PLO rule. Jenin was handed over this month and
Tulkarm, in the northern West Bank, is to be evacuated by the Israeli army on
December 10.
Meanwhile, Israel today froze gradual handover of West Bank population centres,
set for completion by the end of the year, after the brief kidnap of two of its
soldiers in Jenin yesterday by Black Panther members retaliating against
Israeli attempts to arrest a Fatah man in nearby Qabatiyeh.
The Black Panthers are a militant offshoot of Palestine Liberation Organisation
leader Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction. They were leaders in the
northern West Bank in the fight against Israeli occupation during the
Palestinian uprising.
The kidnappers released the Israelis and their weapons after extensive
Israeli-PLO mediation. Israeli troops later lifted a siege of the Qabatiyeh
coffee shop where the Fatah man had taken refuge. He surrendered to Palestinian
police.
Palestinian police Colonel Wajih Abu Gharbiyeh told reporters today that four
Black Panthers had been arrested for the kidnapping and would be tried.
Later today, two Israelis were wounded when shots were fired at an Israeli bus
near the Jewish settlement of Shaked on Jenin's outskirts, the Israeli army
said.
The bus was being escorted by Israeli army jeeps and Abu Gharbiyeh said it was
in an area where the Israelis were responsible for security.-Reuter.

painting ``naked and as it is''.

THE morning after receiving a #10,000 cheque for the McVitie's Prize as 1995
Scottish Writer of the Year, Frank Kuppner is sitting drinking tea with lemon
in the Brasserie Metro in Glasgow's West End.
There has been no big overnight celebration: this quiet-spoken, studious man of
44 has invested too much of his life in developing his gifts to have his head
turned by success. ``The money releases you to concentrate your mind on other
things,'' he says.
Kuppner is a Glaswegian, educated at St Mungo's, who went to Glasgow University
to study English and German but left without taking a degree.
``It was a general sense that this wasn't really what I should be doing. I
don't regret it in terms of thinking I was wrong; I regret it in terms of not
making a better use of my time. Your surroundings are thick with people giving
you what is actually good advice, but there are things you have to find out for
yourself.''
After leaving Gilmorehill, Kuppner helped his father, an electronics engineer,
in his shop while trying to write. What maintained his creative drive was the
feeling he was about to do better than he was doing. ``I remember Francis Bacon
the painter saying that he was an optimist, but not about anything. I always
felt that way myself, without having any particular grounds to be optimistic.''
Kuppner's first book, A Bad Day for the Sung Dynasty, poems on Chinese themes,
came out in 1984. ``Before your first book's published you've no idea what sort
of difference it's going to make. Conceptually and in terms of your own image
it's crucially important. You think: I'm a writer. Questions of how precarious
it is, or if there's a living in it, are secondary.''
His first all-prose work, A Very Quiet Street, was published by Polygon in
1989. ``They put it out with a cover, saying: a novel of sorts. To me it's not
a novel of any sort, except in the sense that with any long prose work,
slightly unusual, it's perhaps safer to call it a novel than to present it as a
sort of academic text.''
The book has two themes: the Oscar Slater murder case and Kuppner's upbringing
in Glasgow. It uses the technique of imaginative reconstruction to integrate
the two themes. Is A Very Quiet Street faction - a mixture of fiction and fact
- as in Truman Capote's In Cold Blood? ``It's not faction, it's fact,'' Kuppner
says. ``It's an attempt to get as factual as facts can be.''
Of his next prose book, A Concussed History of Scotland, Kuppner admits: ``It's
a work I have difficulty in categorising, so I'm not surprised that other
people have difficulty in categorising it. It's like prose poetry. Reading
between the lines, I think it was no accident that for a couple of years after
that I didn't get anything else published. In terms of career structure it was
a bad move.''
Polygon couldn't have thought that when they accepted his latest book,
Something Very Like Murder (#8.99), which has won him this year's McVitie's
Prize.
What genre is it? ``It's not a novel of any sort.'' Like A Very Quiet Street,
it's an investigation of a murder case that has strong personal and
autobiographical overtones. It is based on the Willox murder in Glasgow in the
late 1920s.
``There were resonances because it was about a man living alone with his father
because his mother had recently died. My mother had recently died and although
I wasn't exactly living alone with my father, I was going down there and
helping out quite a lot. The murder occurred exactly between where my father's
first TV shop was and where we lived, so I used to cross this street quite
often.''
Why does the motif of murder occur in his two prose works? ``It's a way of
getting into normal life, apart from anything else, because the people who
lived next door and across the street were not recorded. There was no reason to
record their lives, unless something very unusual was about to happen.'' Murder
enquiries require testimonies, with people in the area having to account for
their movements at the time of the crime.
``I went to newspapers to find out stuff about the Willox case, and was
continually being sidetracked by really fascinating snippets of information.
Again, these accounts have to be quite dramatic, otherwise they won't get into
the papers. Nobody's going to say, so and so went out and bought half a dozen
rolls in the morning, unless they get knocked down on the way back.
``It requires a certain element of anomaly in the circumstances before the
normality is recorded. You get a terrific sense of life out of researching
this.''
Our conversation is closing; Kuppner is now going off to a writers' group to
share his gifts. ``I've published seven books, two about murders, but even
that's a gross exaggeration of the time I spend writing about murder cases.
Everything I've ever written about murder cases has been published. Other stuff
has not been published.''
Maybe the McVitie's Prize will change that? ``One tries to chain one's
optimism.''

SCOTS supercook Mo Scott will be busier than most in the run-up to Christmas as
she slaves over a hot stove in her Renfrewshire farmhouse kitchen. Sometimes
she finds it hard to keep the festive spirit alive . . . for she has built up
such a reputation for her fine cooking that, come this time of year, she is
inundated with requests for homemade produce.
Mention mince pie and she's guaranteed to wince. Last year, she turned out 2300
before Christmas Day. This year, she expects five thousand hand-made pies to
leave her oven. Since running Glasgow's successful Poachers Restaurant - a
stint which kept her occupied for eight years, until she set up her own
Earlshill Farm Foods business almost two years ago - she has made quite a name
for herself, producing fine cuisine and gourmet food.
A mouth-watering range of pre-packed meals, all made with fresh ingredients and
no preservatives, additives or colourings, has customers hooked as far away as
London. This year, Scott has put together two attractive gourmet hampers, #30
and #50.
A new item on her list of Christmas gift offers should prove a hit with people
from all walks of life. She says: ``We are offering gift vouchers for our
cookery demonstrations. These should hit the spot with women who want to get
rid of their men for an evening.
``It will be a bonus, too, if they return home with new skills to prove they
know their stuff.''
The cookery sessions take place in Scott's kitchen at Newton of Belltrees, near
Lochwinnoch. Each week the procession of satisfied customers making the trek to
her front door gets longer and longer.
The Earlshill Farm Foods Christmas selection contains Plum Pudding in two sizes
at #6.50 and #8.50; Mince Pies, #3.50 per dozen; Filo Canapes, #5 per dozen;
Christmas Freezer Packs at #50 and #100, and, of course those
beautifully-decorated wicker baskets full of delicious home-made goodies and a
half bottle of Muscat de Frontignan dessert wine. In the run-up to Christmas,
Scott will be staging cookery demonstrations for a Fireside Supper; The Cool,
Calm Christmas Lunch and The Breakneck Christmas Banquet. Telephone

A NUMBER of players from Rangers and Aberdeen football clubs may face court
action over incidents during the November 11 match at Ibrox, it emerged
yesterday.
An SFA disciplinary hearing in Glasgow yesterday suspended Rangers and England
midfield player Paul Gascoigne and his team-mate John Brown for one game.
However, Mr Tony Higgins, secretary of the Scottish Professional Footballers'
Association, said two of the other three players involved had been ``cautioned
by police''.
The men already interviewed were named by Mr Higgins as Alan McLaren of Rangers
and Billy Dodds of Aberdeen. Their caution indicates that there may be a
possibility of further action against them once reports are sent to the
procurator-fiscal.
Mr Higgins also said their cases had not been considered by the SFA because of
the police caution. Millions of television viewers witnessed the two men
clashing during play and a subsequent intervention involving John Brown.
Another Aberdeen player, midfielder Paul Bernard, is also thought to have been
interviewed by police and to have given a statement in relation to an incident
which involved Gascoigne.
The department of the Glasgow procurator-fiscal, Mr Andrew Normand, had called
for the investigation but had not yet received reports.
It will be up to the fiscal to decide which, if any, of the players involved in
the on-field incidents are to be treated as victims and which, if any, as
aggressors. It would also be open to him to take no action.
An SFA spokesman indicated yesterday that Gascoigne, Brown and Alan Lawrence of
Hearts and Sean Sweeney of Airdrie had all been found guilty of ``bringing the
game into disrepute''.
Both Lawrence and Sweeney were given one match bans for on-field bad behaviour.
But it appears the Glasgow procurator-fiscal has not become involved in the
Lawrence case, which involved an incident in an earlier premier division game
at Ibrox and that the fiscal at Perth has no involvement in the Sweeney
incident in which the Airdrie player appeared on television to take a kick at a
prone opponent during a cup semi-final at McDiarmid Park.
This is bound once again to raise doubts over the intervention of fiscals in
some on field incidents but not in others.
In an earlier article in The Herald, lawyers and leading figures in the game
called for a clear policy statement from the Crown Office and a consistent
policy to be applied across the country by every procurator-fiscal.

St Gallen, Thursday
A SWISS court ended a painful chapter in its nation's history today when it
cleared the name of a police chief convicted 55 years ago of falsifying
documents to rescue up to 3000 Jews from the Nazis.
Jews saved by Paul Grninger, who died a broken man aged 80 in 1972, hailed the
verdict as a victory over racism and intolerance.
``The first lesson is not to be racist or judge people by their origin but to
judge them instead, as Grninger did, for what they are,'' said Harry Weinreb,
74, saved by Grninger in 1938 when he fled German-annexed Austria.
The court president, delivering the verdict in the same courtroom where
Grninger was tried in 1940, said the police chief had acted as an ``emergency
helper'' when he falsified papers to enable Jewish refugees to find sanctuary.
``That's not illegal and therefore he is acquitted,'' he said.
Grninger was police chief in the St Gallen canton, which borders Austria, when
neutral Switzerland closed its frontiers on August 19, 1938, to Jews fleeing
Nazi persecution.
At the same time, the Swiss asked Berlin to stamp the passports of Jews with a
J to make it easier for border guards to recognise them and turn them back.
Obeying his conscience, Grninger began to rescue Jews by falsifying records
and back-dating entry stamps in their papers to mislead authorities into
thinking they had arrived before the border closure. He was sacked in 1939 and
a year later convicted of fraud and fined.
Grninger never found regular work again, drifting from job to job. He was
awarded the Medal of the Just by Israel's Yad Vashem foundation in 1971, but
died a year later still unrecognised by his own            country.
The case has come in the same year, the 50th anniversary of the war's end, that
the Swiss Government has apologised for the first time for its shabby treatment
of Jews before and during the war.

THE Government announced the handing back of a tranche of minor powers to
Scottish local authorities last night as part of plans to undermine demands for
a Scottish Parliament, but the move was immediately condemned by the Opposition
as a con trick.
It was the second time in as many days that measures intended as ``popular
devolution'' by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth were criticised as too
little too late by opponents.
St Andrew's Day was a constitutional battleground as both the Government and
nationalists sought to steal the thunder of the launch of plans for a Scottish
Parliament by the Scottish Constitutional Convention.
Mr Forsyth began the day with an onslaught on the ``tartan tax'' and he ended
the day in Glasgow with a speech announcing that he would be handing powers
back to local authorities as part of his constitutional campaign.
However, he made clear that his plans to strengthen the Scottish Grand
Committee would not involve giving it powers to vote down any legislation
brought before it.
Labour attacked his announcements. ``Giving a few powers back to local councils
and beefing up old quangos is not real devolution,'' said Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson. ``It's a con trick.
``Given that the Tories have systematically stripped local councils of their
powers over the last 16 years, it's a bit like the burglar who strips your
house from top to bottom and then asks for congratulations when he gives you
back the candlesticks.''
But Mr Forsyth, in his Dick Stewart Memorial Lecture last night, said he wanted
to bring every tier of decision making closer to the people. The current demand
for devolution had been induced, he claimed.
``The devolution hype has, for six and a half years, been orchestrated through
the Constitutional Convention by self-interested politicians for party
advantage.
``Yet sometimes a benefit can indirectly derive from a cynical political
exercise and, provided the people of Scotland have the insight to reject the
base currency of the convention, it is good that they should scrutinise the
genuine coin of government.''
Mr Forsyth said the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities had provided a
list of 52 measures they felt would strengthen councils and he had agreed to
consider more than half of them, rejecting outright only nine. Councils would
now be given block grants and decide for themselves how to cut the cake.
They would regain the power to make local by-laws - ``a radical step in
constitutional terms,'' he claimed. Planning rules would be eased and councils
may in future be allowed to bid for housing being sold off by Scottish Homes.
``Taken together, these ideas amount to a considerable shift in the entire
emphasis of Scottish government, notably in its accountability to our people,''
he said. ``They are the first wave in a tide of reform which can sweep across
the shoreline of government to change the shape of it forever.''
There was a cautious welcome to some of the proposals from Cosla. Senior
vice-president Keith Geddes said they were a step in the right direction, but
they would continue to argue for 16 measures on which there was to be further
consultation.
But he added: ``Council capping is to continue and the case for councils to
have freedom to incur expenditure in the interests of their inhabitants - the
power of general competence - has not been accepted.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said it was ``a paltry and
inadequate speech''.
The SNP's parliamentary leader, Mrs Margaret Ewing, said that having stripped
local government of 120 powers they had handed a few minor powers back. ``By
hyping these proposals far beyond what they merited Michael Forsyth has brought
ridicule to himself and his Government.''
Both SNP leader Alex Salmond and Mr Robertson focused on the refusal to give
the Scottish Grand Committee the power to vote. But Mr Forsyth said his Labour
opponent was ``foolish'' to go down the road of that argument.
There was a power to create an English Grand Committee, he pointed out, and he
doubted whether a future Labour Government would be happy to see such a body
vote down its legislation should there be a majority of Tory MPs in England and
Wales. ``George Robertson is making a federalist case without realising it,''
he claimed.

BOTSWANA'S President Ketumile Masire will call a special summit of southern
African leaders to discuss sanctions against Nigeria over the hanging of nine
political activists, presidential secretary Bergsman Sentile said today.
``The meeting is being arranged. We are contacting the heads of states to
arrange a convenient date,'' Sentile said.
South African President Nelson Mandela had asked Masire to convene a summit on
Nigeria in his capacity as current chairman of the 12-nation Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
In Pretoria, a government source said South Africa was confident the summit
would be held within two weeks.
A diplomatic source said the summit was expected to be held in South Africa,
possibly on December 11.
The SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
The source in Pretoria said President Mandela wanted to report to the leaders
on initiatives he had taken to put pressure on Nigeria's military rulers after
the hanging earlier this month of the nine minority rights activists.
``What Mandela wanted to do and will do is to report to them on the initiatives
he has taken,'' the source said.
These included telephone conversations with Prime Minister John Major and US
President Bill Clinton urging them to impose a ban on buying Nigerian oil, the
country's most important export.
Mandela also called in top local officials of the Shell oil company, which has
key interests in Nigeria, to demand that Royal Dutch/Shell pull out of Nigeria.
Washington has rejected an oil embargo. Britain, meanwhile, has not ruled out
sanctions against Nigeria's military rulers so long as sanctions did not harm
ordinary Nigerians.-Reuter.

IT was cloth cap and morning dress when veteran comedian Norman Wisdom
collected his OBE from the Queen at Buckingham Palace yesterday.
And the 80-year-old entertainer could not resist a characteristic comic walk to
bring a smile to people's faces.
Norman Wisdom, it seems, finds it difficult to be serious.
But life has not always been such fun for him.
``I was in a bad way when I was a kid,'' he said. ``I've been on my own since I
was nine.''
As a teenager, Wisdom slept rough in doorways around Victoria in London.
At 14 he was a cabin boy in Argentina, and soon after joined the Army, serving
in India in a concert party.
``I owe everything to the Army - it gave me self-discipline and the concert
party was my introduction to show business.''
He attributes his good health and vitality to a strict diet and vigorous
exercise, walking and jogging in the country lanes near his home on the Isle of
Man.
q Film director Alan Parker, 51, who last year attacked the Government over
lack of support for the British film industry, received the CBE.
Mr Parker, who directed box office hits including Mississippi Burning, Midnight
Express and The Commitments, began working life as an advertising copywriter.
He is currently working in Argentina on the film Evita starring Madonna.
q Sheila McKechnie, 46, director of the Consumers' Association and former head
of the housing charity Shelter, received the OBE.

<HEADLINE>Lecturer queries oil firms' safety figures</HEADLINE>

A SCOTTISH university lecturer yesterdayalleged that an ``incomplete view'' of
offshore safety had been presented by industry chiefs to remove the problem
from public scrutiny.
He also said a Health and Safety Executive study published earlier this week,
which claimed offshore safety was improving, was misleading.
Oil chiefs have spent about #1500m on safety in the wake of the Piper Alpha
tragedy, and maintain that safety is of paramount importance.
According to figures used by the UK Offshore Operators' Association (UKOOA),
the extraction of oil and gas comes 22nd in a ranking of reported industrial
injury rates.
But Dr Charles Woolfson, an industrial relations lecturer at Glasgow
University, and Dr Matthias Beck, an economics lecturer at St Andrews
University, claim the offshore industry is consistently the second or third
most dangerous industry after mining.
Dr Woolfson and Dr Beck, who say that their views are independent of any
organisation, argue that the picture is very different when rates of fatalities
and serious injuries are assessed.
Dr Woolfson said there had been an average of 89.9 fatalities and serious
injuries in the offshore oil industry since 1985, excluding Piper Alpha, and
400 lives lost in the industry since 1970.
But he said the oil companies' figures, which made the industry appear to be
much safer than it really was, included all reported injuries in the petroleum
sector including onshore management and office workers, as well as those
offshore.
Dr Woolfson said their was still much unease about the way new safety measures
were implemented. Many employees believed safety considerations had been
hijacked by oil companies and that the HSE had been virtually neutered because
of company demands.
He argued any reconstruction of offshore safety which did not have a
legitimised role for trade union-appointed safety representatives amounted to
an ``incomplete safety regime''.
Testimonials taken by Dr Woolfson and Dr Beck from workers on the Brent Charlie
rig suggested they were deeply sceptical about the way HSE regulations were
enforced.
But a UKOOA spokesman last night claimed that Dr Woolfsoon and Dr Beck had been
``very selective'' in their use of statistics.
The report coincided with the industry embarking on an unprecedented move aimed
at improving its public image in the wake of the summer controversy sparked by
Shell's controverial plan to sink its obsolete Brent Spar installation.
In a calculated bid to wrest the initiative away from environmental groups such
as Greepeace, 37 top oil and gas exploration and production companies yesterday
set out an agreed approach for an open discussion on how unwanted offshore
installations should be decommissioned.

THE senior Palestinian envoy to the United Kingdom last night called for closer
links between Scotland and the Middle Eastern land.
Mr Afif Safieh, general delegate to the UK and ambassador to the Vatican, was
speaking before a lecture organised by the General Union of Palestine Students
in Glasgow. More than 100 people turned up for the talk.
He said Glasgow and the city of Bethlehem already had close links and a
``dormant'' twinning arrangement was due to be ``revitalised''. The Israeli
security and military authorities are due to withdraw from Bethlehem in three
weeks.
Mr Safieh said the two cities had been linked for about three years and a
closer relationship could benefit both Scotland and Palestine.
He said Scotland could reap the economic rewards of helping Palestine to
rebuild after decades of conflict.
Mr Safieh said: ``I hope for a reactivation of links between Glasgow and
Bethlehem on all fronts, from the City Chambers to the universities, churches,
trade union movement and all other relevant institutions. I want the links to
be strategic and long-term and to the mutual benefit of both countries.''
He said tourism would become a key industry in Palestine, particularly in
Bethlehem during the year 2000.
Mr Safieh added: ``Palestine will be flooded with pilgrims and tourists and a
lot of investment is needed. After years of stagnation we have to engineer the
economic take-off of Palestine and tourism is going to be a major component of
that.
``There is room for co-ordination between Glasgow and Bethlehem and I would
welcome any delegation from Scotland to see the opportunities for themselves.''
Mr Safieh reassured Scotland's Jewish community that the peace process would be
pushed forward.
He made no official comment of the current wrangles over bringing the Lockerbie
bombing suspects to justice and the question of Scottish self-government. But,
stressing he was speaking on a personal level, he said the deadlock over a
trial for the Libyan Lockerbie suspects may be broken by setting up a Scottish
court, under the auspices of the British embassy in The Hague.

<HEADLINE>Surgeon in bid to save ailing leader British doctor says Papandreou still has chance</HEADLINE>

A TOP doctor flown in from Britain to help treat ailing Greek Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou, hooked up to life-support systems, tonight said he still
had a fighting chance.
``There is a chance of the Prime Minister recovering,'' said Sir Magdi Yacoub,
the British surgeon who performed open heart surgery on Papandreou in 1988 and
who was called in to see him.
Professor Yacoub told reporters that Papandreou's recovery would not be
``immediate or in the very near future'', but doctors were hopeful.
Yacoub, who is based at Harefield Hospital, Middlesex, was flown to Greece by
the Prime Minister's personal plane accompanied by Harefield anaesthetist Dr
Gavin Wright and a renal expert.
Yacoub gave Papandreou a triple heart by-pass in 1988.
He was the last in a series of foreign specialists flown in to see Papandreou,
76, who was admitted to the Onassis Heart Centre 10 days ago suffering from
pneumonia.
The country's first socialist leader has been kept alive by a respirator to
help his breathing and a dialysis machine supporting his kidneys.
The latest medical bulletin, issued this evening, said his condition was
unchanged and he was still on life-support machines.
``The situation of the Prime Minister's health has not changed in the last six
hours. He had dialysis, which he tolerated well and his breathing is still
being supported by a respirator,'' said a statement.
Earlier, hospital spokes-man Gregory Skalkeas said Papandreou's heart was
working properly and that there was still hope he would recover.
``The premier can't breathe on his own,'' Skalkeas said. ``His heart is working
properly and he is responding to the treatment for his lungs and kidneys. This
tells us there is hope that the premier will recover.''
Hundreds of supporters have camped outside the hospital for days. Today is the
feast of St Andrew's Day when Papandreou celebrates his name day - equivalent
to a birthday in Greece - and many brought flowers and sweets to the hospital
steps.
Senior socialist politicians have kept silent in public on the question of
choosing a successor to the man who founded the Panhellenic Socialist Movement
(Pasok) in 1974.
However party sources said wheeling and dealing was intense and it would
probably boil down to a contest between Defence Minister Gerassimos Arsenis and
former Industry Minister Costas Simitis.
Both have solid pockets of support in the 170-member socialist parliamentary
group, which will pick the replacement for Papandreou if he can no longer carry
out his duties.
It was later announced that Interior Minister and Papandreou confidant Akis
Tsohatzopoulos would stand in for the premier at the EU summit in Madrid in two
weeks' time.
DUBAI: King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, ruler of the world's richest oil producer,
was in hospital in Riyadh for check-ups today. The court made the announcement
but did not reveal whether the 73-year-old king was ill.-Reuter.

Peter McDougall does not look like a likely candidate for a random assault. Nor
does his well-built son Willie. Yet before midnight last Saturday, on a busy
suburban Glasgow thoroughfare, they were suddenly attacked for no other reason
than that they were `there'. Violence runs through some of the playwright's
best-known work. It was there in the Prix Italia-winning Just Another Saturday
and in his adaptation of the Jimmy Boyle autobiography A Sense Of Freedom. But
it is never used gratuitously. Here the writer, who abhors violence, reflects
on brutality at large today
VIOLENCE is endemic today and it's not just a Glasgow problem. It's a national
problem. Urban towns now have their no-go areas as well.
The terrifying thing about it for an ordinary person is that it is so arbitrary
in the way it comes about. It's almost like you're waiting your turn. When's
your number going to come up. There is something inevitable about it.
You're not talking about gangsters or gang wars . . . people saying `OK let's
go and fight against them'. You are no longer talking about the classic idea
that violence is some kind of phenomenon that is restricted to the working
class . . . hard men that work down the pits . . . have a fight on a Saturday
night . . . and go back to their work first thing on a Monday morning. You are
talking about people from a different planet.
Young people have been spiritually bankrupted. They are totally
disenfranchised. There is nothing for them to do at all. Arnold Schwarzenegger
couldn't frighten these kids.
The only other time I experienced the same sort of problem was during the
Edinburgh Festival a few years back. The only difference was there was more
warning.
[McDougall and his girlfriend were followed down the Grassmarket by jeering
youths who eventually launched a frenzied attack. They escaped into a pub.
McDougall suffered minor injuries.]
I'm sure it basically stemmed from the same hopelessness that breeds a complete
lack of concern for anyone else. A woman was involved. It didn't make the
slightest difference. It was the same kind of crazed people.
You can intellectualise all you want about social and moral disintegration -
but the fact is that there have always been bad bastards about. They are not
going to go away. They are on the increase. The reason for that is sociological
and political. The increase in random, motiveless attacks is forcing us to
confront the problem. It is chilling.
To take pleasure out of hurting somebody seems perverse. I cannae understand
it. But to them it's become the norm. One of the great mistakes we constantly
make is that we judge them on our moral standards without realising that their
whole culture is without morals. We constantly judge things on how we'd react
ourselves . . . on what we would do in a particular situation. Then you realise
it's a hopeless task because they are not like us. They don't feel the same way
at all.
If you read a tabloid leader after an old lady has been beaten-up they say
things like, `I hope those cowards wake-up in the morning and feel bad'. They
don't feel bad. That idea of a `coward' is as old-fashioned as the British
Empire. These guys would attack a dozen policemen. One wee guy would attack a
dozen policemen.
A pal of mine who is a huge guy and as hard as they come told me he's been
attacked three times recently. You'd have to be mad to attack him. From our
perspective you would never attack him. But the new breed of thugs don't think
like that. They come from a different culture. A branch of society which has
been totally spurned.
You're not talking about an underclass. You are talking about kids that have
been brutalised to the degree that they don't know the difference between right
and wrong. Conscience doesn't exist anymore. It's the new barbarism. The real
legacy of Thatcherism - psychopathy.
They say there hasn't been a war for 50 years. The truth is World War Three has
been going on and nobody's twigged it. The disenfranchised and underprivileged
might as well be living in an occupied country.
I lived in New York for a bit 10 years ago when there was a backlash against
muggers. It could happen here soon. Maybe a year from now somebody'll break
into a car. People won't just phone the police, they'll run out and beat the
guy to death. And they'll get off with it because the guy was breaking into a
car and he's got a criminal record.
Drink comes into it. When you watch a series like Redcaps on the telly every
single violent incident is drink-related. If people feel completely and utterly
hopeless one of the ways of getting over it is through drinking or using drugs.
Everyone knows that drinking makes people aggressive. Drinking and violence go
together. But there was a time when even guys that drank would leave civilians
alone. They wouldnae attack somebody in the street. They might say daft things
to them but they would never attack somebody who was obviously a civilian and
didnae belong to their culture.
That's changed completely. Anybody's fair game. Including old women of 85 and
86. Every second week there's a photograph in the paper of their bruised faces.
It's no' enough to terrorise an old woman into telling them where her money is.
They've got to leave their mark. It's barbaric.
With Howard as the so-called Home Secretary, they are talking through their
arse. Nothing touches them. Nothing reaches them. They know nothing about
anything. It's that terrifying inability to project themselves into any
environment other than their own.
They can't see anything. At least a writer has actually got to project himself
into something in order to actually write about it. Howard's supposed to be in
charge of various things, like the prison service and making changes to
sentences, but he can only think about it intellectually. He has no real
understanding of what's involved.
There should be more polis on the beat. Squad cars used to be great. You could
phone one and, if your're lucky, it might get there in time to prevent anything
happening. There doesn't seem to be the kind of presence any more . . .
`There's a copper on the corner. Watch what your daein.'

Serb war crimes hidden
THE United States, Germany and France are withholding vital evidence of Serb
atrocities in Bosnia from the international commission they helped set up last
year to prosecute war criminals in the former Yugoslavia.
Nato sources claim that key satellite, telecommunications and photographic
intelligence which could implicate individuals such as Bosnian Serb military
commander Ratko Mladic in the massacre of Muslim civilians is being suppressed
deliberately to help keep the peace process on track.
Two days ago, the UN confirmed that 5500 Muslim former inhabitants and
defenders of the ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica, which fell to the advancing
Serbs in July, are missing amid growing evidence of mass executions.
Now Judge Richard Goldstone, the war crimes' commission's chief prosecutor, has
written to all three governments to complain about lack of co-operation and
express disappointment about ``the timeliness and quality of information''
supplied.
A copy of one of the letters, addressed to the legal adviser at the US Embassy
in The Hague, has come into The Herald's possession. In it, Judge Goldstone
speaks of ``serious problems'' in the flow of evidence, citing delays of
between two and 11 months.
Much of what has been released, particularly by the Americans, has been
``open-source'' material, available to the media, although sometimes not
directly to the commission. The publication of photographs of alleged mass
grave sites near Srebrenica in the summer is one example.
Sources say that the United Kingdom, America's principal intelligence partner,
has been cut out of the information loop on Bosnia since September last year,
when Britain accused the CIA of interfering on the side of the Sarajevo
government.
France was also excluded from the US information flow, but continued to collect
its own intelligence by intercepting telecommunications and through its own
military in Bosnia.
The French told General Bernard Janvier, the United Nations Protection Force
commander in Bosnia, that the Serbs planned a massive assault on the remaining
three safe havens - Srebrenica, Zepa and Gorazde - several weeks in advance of
this.
However, it was made clear to him that his briefing was purely on the basis of
his seniority within the French military hierarchy, and not as UNPROFOR
commander. The UN headquarters in Zagreb maintains it had no advance warning of
the Serb onslaught in July.
Two months earlier, General Janvier asked a closed session of the UN Security
Council to be relieved of responsibility for protection of the besieged
enclaves. Between July 5, when the attack opened, and July 11, when Serb forces
smashed their way into Srebrenica, he also denied five separate requests by the
local Dutch UNPROFOR commander for Nato air strikes.
The Germans, too, allegedly had a major role to play.
The German intelligence service, the BND, had access to about 90% of US
intelligence data, but also operated its own listening post in the Austrian
Alps north of Slovenia - ostensibly run by the Austrian Army.
US-German co-operation reached the stage last year that a joint BND/CIA/
National Security Agency surveillance centre was opened secretly in Augsburg in
southern Germany to deal with developments in former Yugoslavia.
A number of Nato sources are convinced that the US-BND teams intercepted
telephone conversations between the Serb Army chief of staff, General Momcilo
Perisic and General Ratko Mladic, before the attack, and during the massacre of
civilians which followed.
In addition, the Americans are understood to have both satellite and video
footage of some of the atrocities from their unmanned Predator reconnaissance
drones beamed to their base on the Dalmatian island of Drac.

STRATHCLYDE Chief Constable Leslie Sharp spelled out yesterday for the first
time why he is leaving the force early.
Attending his last meeting of the region police and fire committee, he told
members: ``I do not agree with the changes in local government which have come
about in respect of the way they affect the police.''
He also spoke about changes in conditions of service and related pay for police
officers. The whole situation, he said, appeared to be a ``dangerous path''.
If Strathclyde region had remained in being, the authority might have
``squeezed a few more years'' out of him. As it was, he would be leaving at the
end of the year, allowing the new chief constable, Mr John Orr, three months to
``get his feet under the table''.
Recalling his period of service with Strathclyde as ``the happiest
four-and-a-half years of my service'', he said the results achieved had
exceeded anything by any other force in the country since the war.
``We have walked a tightrope together amazingly,'' he told members. ``Progress
has been staggering. People threw at me the appalling crime situation and the
appalling lack of policing in some areas. We have made progress beyond my
wildest dreams. Strathclyde has become a shining beacon in terms of law and
order.''
Mr Sharp declined to amplify his remarks after the committee meeting, but
Deputy Chief Constable James Richardson spoke of the chief's outstanding
qualities of leadership, and the fresh approach he took to policing.
q Some rural areas in the West of Scotland face ``unacceptable delays'' in
response to emergencies, with increased risk to life and property, says
Strathclyde Firemaster John Jameson.
Acknowledging criticism of ``failure to respond'' by some units, Mr Jameson
said in an intermediate report by HM Inspectorate of Fire Services that
changing patterns of work were causing severe problems.
``In areas such as those mentioned by the inspectorate, we use retained
personnel, with pagers. Increasingly, people move out of a village to find
work. We have problems recruiting suitable people locally.
``We also find employers, and some local authorities, can't or won't release
people to attend call-outs. When there was a train crash at Largs recently, a
man was sacked when he turned out and was late for work.
``If we cannot cope properly with changing work patterns and tight constraints,
we would have to consider more full-time people - with implications for finance
for the new unitary authorities.''

<HEADLINE>Authority of toll collector  is disputed Lawyers query Skye Bridge document EXCLUSIVE By DAVID ROSS Highland Correspondent</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975110390</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE operators of the Skye Bridge may not have the legal right to collect tolls
even though more than 36,000 motorists have paid since the bridge opened on
October 16.
Under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, the Secretary of State's right
is unquestionable, but opposition MPs will call on the Government to prove that
right has been competently transferred to Skye Bridge Ltd. There is legal
opinion the matter can only be resolved in a court of law.
The uncertainty arises from the phrasing of the legal document in which the
Secretary of State assigned his rights. Mr Forsyth assigned the rights to a
company which no longer exists.
The possible difficulty with this Assignation Statement came to light when toll
opponent Robbie the Pict, formerly Mr Brian Robertson, attempted to cross the
bridge.
When asked for his #4.30 toll, Robbie had requested the toll collector to show
``. . . his assignation order or whatever documents he believed both identified
him and his employees as lawfully empowered by a warrant issued by the
Secretary of State to collect tolls on this road.''
The Toll Order was produced first which did not satisfy Robbie. ``The document
failed to identify either him or his company as a `Special Roads Authority'.''
An Assignation Statement was eventually faxed from the Scottish Office, but it
did not satisfy either.
The Herald also obtained a copy of the Assignation Statement from the Scottish
Office. In Section Two, under Identity of the Concessionaire (Regulation 3
(a)), it states:
``It is proposed that the Concessionaire will be Skye Bridge Tolls Limited,
incorporated under the Companies Acts and having their registered office at
Miller House, 18 South Groathill Avenue, Edinburgh and their permitted
successors and assignees in accordance with the Concession Agreement.''
Skye Bridge Tolls Ltd was the company originally set up by bridge builders
Miller/Dywidag and their financiers, the Bank of America, but it was replaced
more than two years ago by Skye Bridge Ltd. What is not clear from the
Assignation Statement is whether: it was ever more than ``proposed'' that Skye
Bridge Tolls Ltd should be assigned the toll rights; and if so whether they
were ever properly transferred to Skye Bridge Ltd as permitted successors and
assignees.
A Scottish Office spokesman said this week that all rights and responsibilities
had been passed on to Skye Bridge Ltd which now had the clear legal right to
charge tolls.
But Professor Neil MacCormick, who holds the chair of Public Law and is Provost
of the Law and Social Science Faculty Group at Edinburgh University, said
yesterday these were matters of fact in law which could only be put beyond
question in a court of law.
``The use of language such as `it is proposed' suggests they may have confused
intention for accomplished fact, and the whole thing is clouded by obscurity,''
Professor MacCormick said.
Edinburgh solicitor Mr David Brittain, who is researching the position of the
toll bridge in civil law, agreed: ``There may be other papers and documents,
but as far as I can see what we have here is nothing more than a proposal and
not a proper assignation. Clearly the Secretary of State has the right to
charge tolls, but there is nothing in this document to say Skye Bridge Ltd have
that right.''
Robbie himself is clear: ``Where the operation involves both detaining the
public and demanding monies, the identification of the legitimately warranted
party should be `ad littera', meeting at least the same standards of accuracy
as required in the registration of trademarks.''
Labour's Highlands and Islands spokesman, Mr John McFall, said last night: ``I
will certainly be tabling questions. Given the controversy that continues to
attend the bridge and its imposition, any doubt over the legal position must be
examined.''
Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP Charles Kennedy said: ``I will be writing to Michael
Forsyth saying that here we have a heaven-sent opportunity to test his new
arrangements for the Scottish Grand Committee and that we should invite the
Lord Advocate along so we can question him on this issue.''

WIDENING public transport strikes and demonstrations plunged French cities into
vast traffic jams as action against planned welfare cuts, now in its seventh
day, spread to post, electricity, and gas services.
At least 100,000 railwaymen, public employees, and students demonstrated in a
dozen cities, according to police estimates. Some demanded the resignation of
conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
However, despite the most serious labour unrest since 1986, government
spokesman Alain Lamassoure said the Cabinet would stick to unpopular plans to
reform the social security system.
With 325 miles of traffic jams in the Paris region alone, many workers spent
hours trying to reach their workplace.
The Paris Metro and suburban trains were completely shut for the first day
since the strike began. National rail services were at a standstill for a
seventh straight day except for six trains to London and three to Brussels.
Trade unions decided to extend both the rail and Metro strikes at least until
tomorrow night. Transport Minister Bernard Pons is due to meet rail union
leaders tomorrow afternoon.
The mounting disruption hit industry and took its toll on the franc.
Dealers said the markets were beginning to question Juppe's ability to hold the
line on deficit cuts vital if French is to join a single European currency in
1999.
Gilles de Robien, the leader of the house in parliament, said President Jacques
Chirac might call a referendum or an early general election if the labour
unrest worsened.
The CNPF employers' federation urged the centre-right government to stick to
its austerity plans, but said the strikes were having a serious impact on
companies and must be ended soon.
Officials said the government appeared to be playing for time, counting on
public opinion turning against the strikes and exhaustion setting in before the
Christmas holidays.
The state power utility EDF-GDF said it made a few isolated electricity cuts to
industry owing to a 24-hour stoppage by staff protesting against European Union
plans to open the electricity sector to competition.
Rail and electricity workers marched in Paris, Marseilles, Lyons, Toulouse,
Nantes, Rennes, Brest, Grenoble, and Bordeaux.
Students staged a new day of action, with marches around France to protest
against overcrowding and underfunding.
Three policemen were injured in clashes with masked youths in the western city
of Nantes. There was also a brief clash between youths and riot police who
fired a few tear gas grenades as a 10,000-strong student demonstration marched
through Paris.
The strikes widened to postal services, hitting 50 out of 139 sorting centres,
and to provincial public transport. And road haulage unions urged members to
take action.
There were first signs of action spreading to state-owned France Telecom, where
the communist-led CGT union said 30 out of 1000 centres were on strike. The CGT
also said it had called stoppages at carmaker Renault from early next week. -

SCOTTISH Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton joined Fife Conservatives
to take part in a demonstration in St Andrews yesterday against the proposed
plans for a Scottish parliament.
Around 30 protesters, including the party's North-East Fife prospective
parliamentary candidate, Mr Adam Bruce, marched through the town.
At a rally, Lord James said that a ``tartan tax'' would discriminate against
everyone in Scotland.
He added: ``It is extremely important that we make the people of Scotland aware
how much the tartan tax will cost them.
``This is a tax that is contrary to Scottish interests, that would be damaging
to her economy, and that would drive away inward investment.''
Mr Bruce said the tax would ``impoverish the people of North-East Fife and
drive away jobs''.

WHEN the Prevention of Terrorism Act was introduced in 1974 it was in the wake
of the Birmingham bombings. Days after rescuers were seen picking through
rubble for bits of bodies in a shattered pub, the Labour Government rushed
through the emergency powers.
The then Home Secretary Roy Jenkins described it as a draconian and oppressive
law introduced in response to a civil crisis. He viewed it as a vital measure
to empower police.
What it meant was that they could detain terrorist suspects for up to seven
days and to place exclusion orders on individuals thought to have connections
with proscribed organisations. It became, along with the Emergency Provisions
Act, which enshrined the non-jury Diplock Courts, the twin pillar of Britain's
anti-terrorist legislation.
It was always intended to be a temporary measure with the provisions of both
Acts subject to annual review. Now, some 21 years later, with a ceasefire
holding, it remains in force.
Yesterday's ruling by the European Court of Justice that the operation of the
exclusion orders contained in the Act breaches EU laws brought a swift response
from the Home Secretary.
He concludes that the court did not say the PTA was wrong, merely that
adjustments should be made to procedures for issuing exclusion orders. And
this, on Mr Howard's interpretation, means that suspected terrorists will have
to be held in custody while an independent assessment is made of an order. At
present those issued with an order are generally put on the first flight out of
Britain, or remain at liberty in Northern Ireland.
The legal challenge was mounted by a former Republican activist, John
Gallagher, who was excluded from Britain as a suspected terrorist. Ruling in
his favour, the court sitting in Luxembourg declared that the operation of
procedures for exclusion orders was a breach of freedom of movement, guaranteed
by the Treaty of Rome. A similiar case, brought by Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams, was withdrawn earlier this year, after he was finally allowed into
Britain.
In the summer, six days before the first anniversary of the IRA ceasefire,
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew, renewing the emergency law and
order provisions for the Province, promised an early independent review of the
Prevention of Terrorism Act.
But it would be set up only once a ``lasting peace'' was established he
insisted. Since the ceasefire, he told MPs, there had been 131 punishment
beatings, 62 attributed to loyalists and 69 to republicans.
The Government was ``not going to drop its guard prematurely''. It was an echo
of the Home Secretary's stance in March when he defended the decision to renew
the Act for a further 12 months, saying the Government was not prepared to do
anything which would expose people to unnecessary risk.
However, he announced the lifting of a further 16 exclusion orders that bar
people in Northern Ireland from coming to the mainland.
Figures released two years ago showed that of those held under the terms of the
PTA, 3% were charged with terror offences, 5% with other offences, and 4% were
excluded or deported. Around 90% of those detained under the Act are released
without charge.
Critics argue that while it may once have been an effective means of gaining
information on the activities of others, it played straight into the hands of
the IRA. It was seen as a recruiting sergeant for the terrorism organisations,
who could say to those detained that there is no justice under British laws.
This, it was argued, had a resonance with people, making them fearful of giving
information to the police in case they were held for interrogation. A study by
academics from the School of Law at King's College, London, published earlier
this year, Terrorism And The Rule of Law, found that, from the perspective of
the police, the PTA was not strictly needed.
The authorities no longer haul suspects in to be interrogated, the authors
said. The emphasis now is on intelligence, careful surveillance, and forensic
proof. Suspects are apprehended red-handed rather than pulled in on instinct.
The authors also claim that the law has moved on, with the introduction of an
Act in 1989 which transforms the power of the police in Northern Ireland,
giving them far more ordinary power with which to counter serious crime,
including serious terrorist crime.
At the time the PTA was first enacted it was against a background of a common
law on police powers that was uncertain, ambiguous, and often illogically
restrictive. With ordinary law now allowing wide powers of search and arrest
and authorising four-day detention without charge, the PTA was being deployed
more because it is known than because it is needed, they said.
There were indications early this year from Home Office sources that Michael
Howard was considering suspending the exclusion powers while the ceasefire
held. Nothing happened. It may well be therefore that the Act, in all its
constituent parts, is being viewed as one of the poker chips in the peace talks.

<HEADLINE>Royal train firm set for sale to Americans</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975110394</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE company which moves the Royal Train - and runs Royal Mail trains and many
football specials - is set to be sold to an American firm, according to the
Labour Party last night.
Rail Express Systems, a British Rail subsidiary, is due to become one of the
first train operating companies to be privatised, a British Railways Board
spokesman confirmed.
But he would not confirm the report by Labour transport spokesman Brian Wilson
that the only company involved in the negotiations is Wisconsin Railways, a
major US freight train operator.
``It is a further Tory humiliation for Britain that we need Americans to own
and operate the engines which pull the Royal Train, the Royal Mail and football
specials,'' Mr Wilson said.
A Labour Party spokesman said they had been passed a copy of a letter from Mr
Charles Belcher, managing director of Rail Express Systems, telling staff that
a management buy-out team was ``not the preferred bidder'' for the firm.
That left the Wisconsin company as the only potential buyer still under
consideration, the Labour spokesman said.
The BR spokesman said he could confirm that the letter, dated November 24, was
``genuine''.
Rail Express Systems did not own the Royal Train, he said. As the only train
operating company licensed for the entire network, it was responsible for
arranging its movements when needed, and sometimes for providing the
locomotives.
The Royal Train carriages would continue to belong to Railtrack, which was
currently publicly owned, the BRB spokesman said.
The plan to sell Rail Express Systems was announced in January, when the
Government invited ``expressions of interest''.
The company was said then to have 720 staff, 161 diesel and electric
locomotives, 133 travelling Post Office carriages and 400 general purpose rail
vans.
Labour's Brian Wilson called for the RES sale to be put on hold until the full
implications had been examined.
``This has been a successful operation in which a great deal of taxpayers'
money has been invested,'' he said.
``Britain is the country which gave railways to the world. Now the world is
being handed our railways. What sense or logic is there in this whole process?''
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said it had no comment on the reported sell-off,
as rail privatisation was a matter for the Department of Transport.
A department spokesman said: ``It has been uppermost in the minds of both BR
and the department that the utmost importance is attached to ensuring that the
change of ownership will have no prejudicial effect on the safety, security or
the efficient operation of the Royal Train - or any other trains operated by
RES.''
The sale was expected to go ahead before the end of the year, but he could give
no details of prospective buyers, he said.

<HEADLINE>President lights up the hopes for peace Ulster hails Clinton</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975110395</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and two children switched on the Belfast Christmas
lights last night, a symbol of peace and hope matched by the political reality
of talks for Ulster's parties.
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton revealed invitations to talks under the terms
of the new Northern Ireland peace process twin-track approach are to be sent
out today.
In Dublin, ahead of Mr Clinton's arrival there in this morning, Mr Bruton said
he believed the American leader's visit was having ``a huge influence'' in
encouraging the politicians to follow the line adopted by the British and Irish
Governments this week.
Mr Clinton sent a blunt message to the Ulster paramilitaries that their time
was finally over, just an hour before shaking hands for the first time in
public with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in the Falls Road. Later he had a
private meeting with the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist
Party.
Thousands of people from both sides of the divide turned out to cheer his
historic visit across the Province, the first by a serving US President.
He called on the Ulster people to stand up with courage to the terrorists in
the fight for a just and lasting peace.
``The greatest struggle you face now is not between opposing ideas or opposing
interests,'' he said. ``The greatest struggle you face is between those who
deep down inside are inclined to be peacemakers and those who deep down inside
cannot yet embrace the cause of peace.''
He said there would also be people who could never escape the ``dead-end
street'' of violence.
``But you, the vast majority, Protestant and Catholic alike, must not allow the
ship of peace to sink on the rock of old habits and hard grudges.''
The discussions which, it is hoped, will shape the future of the land, are
being staged side-by-side with the work of the special three-man international
body on the difficult arms decommissioning issue. The body will be chaired by
US Senator George Mitchell.
The aim is for both the preparatory talks and the body's task to be completed
in time for all-party negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland to get
under way by the end of February.
Mr Bruton said he believed Mr Clinton's engagements yesterday ``would do
wonders for the morale of the people''. He added: ``It will show the peace they
have been able to build is recognised internationally by the most powerful
politician in the world.
``I think that will give them and their political leaders the confidence that
they need to make the compromises, to give the ground that is essential if the
potential of the twin-track process is to be realised.
``The timing could not be better. It was very important that we got the
structure together so that the President could give us the boost that was
necessary.''
There were two poignant moments yesterday which boosted the hopes for peace and
encapsulated the high emotion of the presidential visit.
Pleas for peace from a Roman Catholic girl and a Protestant boy visibly moved
Mr Clinton as he listened to their tales of horror and dreams for the future
from different sides of the Belfast peace line.
The children addressed the Mackies metalworks in west Belfast before the
President spoke.
Catherine Hamill, nine, whose father was gunned down by loyalist killers, said
her Christmas wish was for peace and love in Ireland to last forever.
``My first daddy died in the troubles,'' she said. ``It was the saddest day of
my life. I still think of him. Now it is nice and peaceful. I like having peace
and quiet for a change instead of people shooting and killing.''
Ten-year-old David Sterrett added: ``I think the peace is great because there
is no shooting or bombing. It means that I can play in the park without
worrying about getting shot.'' Then they held hands, and introduced the
President.
Later, as the 50-car presidential motorcade cruised slowly down the Falls Road,
Mr Clinton stopped for a brief meeting with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, which
had been set up amid intense secrecy just hours earlier.
The Sinn Fein president stepped forward and, shaking Mr Clinton's hand, greeted
him with the traditional Gaelic Cead Mile Failte, a thousand welcomes.
He escorted the President into a cafe, where he had been having a cup of tea,
for a short discussion in the Republican heartland of West Belfast.
Mr Adams said: ``He is obviously pretty pleased to be here and enthused by the
reception of the people.''
There was an equally tumultuous reception for Mr Clinton when he made an
impromptu stop in loyalist Shankill Road after making a symbolic crossing of
the peace line dividing the two communities.
He stunned cheering crowds by walking into a fruit shop and buying apples and a
bunch of flowers for his wife Hillary. He then happily paid the #3 bill with
sterling.
But it was the President's keynote speech at the Mackie plant that cemented his
support for the twin-track peace process agreed this week by London and Dublin.
He called on all the parties to put aside their differences and seize this new
opportunity for peace in the Province.
``Engaging in honest dialogue is not an act of surrender but an act of strength
and common sense,'' he said.
``Moving from ceasefire to peace requires dialogue. For 25 years the history of
Northern Ireland has been written in the blood of its children and their
parents.
``The ceasefire turned the page on that history. It must not be allowed to turn
back.''
He paid tribute to the courage of British and Irish political leaders for their
commitment to peace but also 1
praised Mr Adams and fringe loyalist political leaders for helping to silence
the guns.
Mr Clinton then pledged American political and economic support for all those
prepared to take risks for peace.
Later he met Ulster political leaders away from the glare of publicity at a
reception hosted by Secretary of State Sir Patrick Mayhew at Queen's University.
He talked with Mr Paisley in a room away from the reception, the DUP leader
having refused to go in to the main function where Mr Adams and his Sinn Fein
colleague Martin McGuinness were among 300 guests.
He told the President: ``We will not put up barriers to a real peace, but it
can't be a real peace when people have murder weapons in their hands.''
At the reception, Mr Clinton met many of the Province's local politicians,
including Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, and the leaders of the two
fringe loyalist groups, Mr Gary McMichael of the Ulster Democratic Party and Mr
David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party.
The various political groupings all stayed away from each other, Sinn Fein
members at one end of the room, Ulster Unionists at the other end, and the
fringe loyalists in the middle.
The President said he would remember his day in Northern Ireland ``for as long
as I live. I am proud the United States stands with the peace makers.''
That theme had been emphasised when the Clintons turned on the Christmas
lights. They were accompanied by two children, Mark Lennox and Cathy Harte, who
had won a competition to write a letter to the President.
Mrs Clinton read from the winning letter of Cathy, 12, a Catholic from Belfast,
and Mark, a 15-year-old schoolboy from Glengormley.
Cathy wrote: ``I love it here, it's green, it's beautiful and well, it's
Ireland.
``All my life I've only known guns and bombs, with people fighting. Now it's
different, there are no guns and bombs. Hopefully, the peace will be permanent,
that one day Catholics and Protestants will be able to walk hand in hand, and
will be able to live in the same areas.''
This was greeted with rapturous applause from the large crowd.
Cathy had added: ``What I hope is that when I have my own children, that there
will still be peace, and that Belfast will be a peaceful place from now on''.
Mark had written that ``we must all learn to live with each other in a more
tolerant way . . . Some people want to destroy peace and the peace process in
Northern Ireland. We must not allow this to     happen.''
Mrs Clinton said: ``Let us remember why we light Christmas trees. Let us
remember that we seek peace most of all for our children.
``May this be one of many, many happy and peaceful Christmases in Northern
Ireland this year and for many years to come.''
Mr Clinton, as he switched on the lights, said: ``May the Christmas spirit of
peace and goodwill flourish, and grow in you.''
He finished: ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit the Earth.''

A LOYALIST para-military force was keeping itself in a state of readiness in
the event of the end of the ceasefire in Northern Ireland, a court heard
yesterday.
A senior Royal Ulster Constabulary intelligence officer told the High Court in
Glasgow that the Ulster Volunteer Force was still gathering arms, although it
had not used them.
Detective Inspector Paul Hamlyn, 38, said: ``Intelligence would indicate they
are still going about their business, although there's no violence whatsoever.''
Mr Hamlyn was giving evidence on the seventh day of the trial of six men who
deny conspiracy, gun-running and drug trafficking on behalf of the UVF.
They include Mr Lindsay Robb, from Lurgan, a Progressive Unionist Party
politician, who met Ulster Minister Michael Ancram for peace talks in June.
The court has heard that one of the accused, Mr John Johnston, 49, organised
dances and raffles in his home town area of Falkirk, to raise money for the
Loyalist Prisoners' Welfare Association.
Mr Hamlyn said the LPWA was not a registered charity; it looked after the needs
of imprisoned members of the UVF and their families, providing money, food
parcels and clothing or whatever was needed. Each battalion was responsible for
collecting its own money, and a certain proportion was sent to brigade
headquarters.
He admitted he did not know whether any of the cash it raised went towards
buying arms.
Earlier yesterday the court heard Mr Robb's girlfriend, Ms Margaret Glen, 33,
give evidence that he was with her on the evening of June 22 at her home in
Airdrie.
The prosecution have alleged that Mr Robb was in a pub in Laurieston that night
and took a gun out of his bag and placed it under a man's knee.
Mr John Johnston, 49, Mr Francis Hives, 45, of Liverpool, Mr William McArthur,
41, of Bonnybridge, Mr David White, 29, of Airdrie, Mr Alexander Davidson, 23
and Mr Lindsay Robb, 28, both from Lurgan, deny conspiring to further by
criminal means the aims of the UVF.
The trial continues.

THE number of new Aids and HIV cases diagnosed by the end of the year in
Scotland will be higher than in any other year since the infection first came
to prominence in the 1980s, an expert has predicted.
The warning came on the eve of World Aids Day and has major implications for
health care authorities, support services and charities.
Dr David Goldberg, deputy director of the Scottish centre for infection and
environmental health based at Glasgow's Ruchill Hospital, said yesterday that
up to the end of September 114 new Aids cases had been registered. He said to
date the highest annual number of cases had totalled 124.
He predicted that the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases would total around
200, the highest since 1987.
However, he said these figures did not mean the number of infections were
rising but that those infected during the 1980s had now become ill. ``The
demand on health care with respect to HIV and Aids will now be greater than
ever.''
Dr Goldberg said analysis of the latest figures and a number of academic
studies painted a varied picture of Aids and HIV infection in Scotland. He said
that while half of Scotland's 2338 people with HIV were drug users there had
been a marked decline in new infections since the mid-1980s.
He attributed this to the success of needle exchange schemes and methadone
programmes. The doctor said the spread of the infections in the heterosexual
population had stabilised.
But he said of most concern was the continuing rise in new infections among the
gay population.
His comments came as the Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
warned against complacency. The Minister said the purpose of World Aids Day,
organised by the World Health Organisation and the National Aids Trust, was to
draw attention to the problem.
``Complacency in any sector of the community is a real threat in the fight
against Aids and HIV.''
A number of events are being held across the UK today including a vigil in
Edinburgh.

THE hard-line reputation of Scotland's criminal courts has been upheld by the
latest government figures showing record numbers of people being imprisoned.
Almost 16,000 people were given custodial sentences after conviction in 1994, a
5% increase on previous levels and, according to the Scottish Office, the
highest figure recorded.
The trend was heavily criticised yesterday by the Labour Party and pressure
groups.
Critics are alarmed by the way young men dominate the figures, culled from the
Statistical Bulletin. One in four males aged 17 in 1989 had been convicted of a
crime in the six-year period up to 1994.
However, the increased use of prison is set against the backdrop of a falling
caseload for courts. The number of court cases fell by 3%.
The Scottish figures confirm statistics produced by the Council of Europe which
show that Scotland's judges jail a higher percentage of the population than
their counterparts in most western European countries.
Labour's home affairs spokesman, Mr John McFall, said: ``We have to ask why we
are top of the league in imprisoning our people, and particularly so many of
our young population.
``One quarter of young men have a conviction. What kind of society are we
fostering? This, after 17 years of Conservative government, is a condemnation
of their approach.
``We need a change in attitude. The answer is not to throw people in jail. What
is prison for? We do imprison people who deserve to be in prison, but should
not be filling jails just for the sake of it.''
Ms Carole Ewart, of the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, said custodial
sentences were not the answer in many cases. ``Our view is that too many people
are sent to prison and it doesn't work,'' she said.
The rise in the percentage of custodial sentences is, according to the
bulletin, partly because of the increased use of prison sentences for crimes of
dishonesty.

<HEADLINE>Professor calls for ban on all beef offals</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975110400</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LEADING brain disease expert has warned that ``mad cow disease'' could be
transmitting to humans.
Neuropathologist Professor Sir Bernard Tomlinson says there is growing evidence
that the human equivalent of the disease can be caught from infected beef
products.
His warning comes after reports that at least three farmers and three teenagers
have been struck down by Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).
Sir Bernard outlines his fears in an interview with BBC Radio 4 lunchtime
consumer programme You and Yours which is due to be broadcast just after noon
today.
He calls for a ban on all beef offals.
Sir Bernard, who headed an inquiry into the future of London hospitals, says he
no longer eats meat pies or beef liver and ``at the moment'' would not eat a
burger ``under any circumstances''.
Sir Bernard says: ``The involvement of farmers and the involvement of young
people have made me look again at the whole problem and change my mind to the
feeling that we might now have an association.
``I don't think it's stronger than that with BSE but it is now possible that
BSE is transmitting to humans.''
He adds: ``There's clearly an economic price to pay but . . . until we know the
answer, until we can say quite positively there really is no evidence now that
BSE transfers to humans, until we can say that, I believe we've got to pay that
price and all offal should be kept from public consumption.''
The Government continues to stress that there is no proven link between BSE and
CJD and it says the numbers of cases of BSE are falling year on year.
But the You and Yours' report says cattle most likely to die from BSE were born
in 1987 - when their feed was most toxic.
There are fears that young people may now be at risk because the burgers they
ate in the late 1980s were the most highly contaminated.
The Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (Maff) has recently clamped down
on slaughterhouses in an effort to ensure that certain offals already banned do
not leak into the food chain.
Earlier this week Maff further strengthened controls by banning cattle
backbones, used in meat pies and sausages, from the food chain.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair last night stepped into the ``tartan tax'' debate by
emphasising that a Scottish parliament's tax-raising powers would only be used
with the approval of the electorate.
His intervention, designed to distract from Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth's St Andrew's Day address, included a personal pledge to defend the
Union.
He also rejected the additional powers for the Scottish Grand Committee
announced by Mr Forsyth on Wednesday, which include the right to call
non-Scottish Ministers to account, for failing to close the democratic deficit.
In a policy speech that suggested Labour's unease at the implications of the
parliament's right to increase income tax by up to 3p, Mr Blair said: ``There
is a very big difference between having tax-raising powers, and raising tax.''
Under Labour's proposals, a Scottish parliament could vary the standard rate of
tax by 3p up or down. Mr Forsyth has attacked the power as a ``tartan tax''.
Mr Blair said the amount by which the parliament could raise or lower tax
amounted to less than 5% of Scotland's budget. ``The important point is that it
is for the people to elect the parliament and the parliament to decide whether
taxes should rise or fall, and justify its decision.
``There is a very big difference between having tax-raising powers, and raising
tax. The Westminster Parliament can levy tax but parties proposing matters
connected with taxes have to be elected on their programme; and governments
that raise taxes face the electorate.
``That is an exercise in democracy.''
Rejecting Tory claims that devolution would lead to independence for Scotland,
Mr Blair insisted: ``Let me absolutely clear about one thing. I would never
agree to anything which threatened to break up the United Kingdom. I believe in
the United Kingdom.''
``Scotland is vital part of it in every way - economically, socially,
politically, historically. To us devolution is essential if the unity of
Britain is to be maintained and strengthened.
``The real threat to the Union comes from a government that will not face up to
the clearly stated desires of the people of Scotland - desires that are well
understood by the rest of Britain - to have a greater say over the way Scotland
is run.''
He said: ``For 16 years the government have been telling us that there is
nothing wrong with the way Scotland is governed from Westminster. For 16 years
they have said the Scottish people were wrong to want more control over their
own affairs,'' he said.
``Now the Government have acknowledged that it is they who were wrong. They
admit that the way Scotland is governed from London is inadequate and needs to
change. But while they have finally admitted the problem they have failed to
face up to the solution.''

region. In addition to the handsome trophy, the charity, based in Wellington
Street, will receive #1000 to help in its work assisting young and old come to
terms with loss.
Formed to offer financial advice to widows and children, Cruse opened its
Glasgow branch in the early 1970s. Its trained volunteers deal with a
bewildering assortment of personal tragedies helping people come to terms with
grief.
However, adults don't have a monopoly on such emotions and one of the most
difficult and sensitive areas the counsellors have tackled over the past four
years is helping bereaved children.

THE Tories turned up the heat on the tax-raising powers of the proposed
Scottish Parliament yesterday by claiming that #12m would go straight into the
pockets of its MPs and support staff.
Seeking to steal the St Andrew's Day thunder of the Scottish Constitutional
Convention, the party wheeled into place in front of the old Royal High School
building in Edinburgh a mobile advertising hoarding stating that the tartan tax
would go not towards schools or hospitals but to politicians.
The Tories broke down the direct running cost of the proposed Parliament into
the salaries, office allowances and overnight expense allowances of 129 MSPs,
salaries for promoted posts, the cost of researchers and severance pay for
those voted out of office.
Mr Forsyth said this would come out at more than #12m and he said that, with
the cost of building the new parliament in its first year, this would rise to a
total of #42.5m - the cost of a large general hospital.
However, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson countered: ``Even on his
figures, which we believe are inflated, this is about one-third of the money
wasted by the Government on the HCI private hospital, and only about 2% of the
money wasted on an unwanted reorganisation of local government.''
The Conservative leaflet stated that someone on #8320 would pay #2.77 per week
in extra ``tartan tax'' if the full 3p power was implemented; on a #14,400
income this would rise to #6.33; at #22,080 the tax would be #10.70; and an
earner on #76,000 would pay an extra #41.81 weekly.''
After showing off the advertising trailers for the cameras, Scottish Tory
chairman Sir Michael Hirst told a press conference that the proposed tartan tax
would be a ``complicated, costly, administrative nightmare'' and he was
confident that opposition to Home Rule would grow as this dawned on the
electorate.
Of the running costs of the Parliament, the president of the Scottish
Conservative and Unionist Association, Mr David McLetchie, said he did not
believe the people of Scotland would be prepared to sacrifice vital services to
pay for more politicians and bureaucrats.
Mr Forsyth made clear that he was going to wage a relentless onslaught on the
tax-raising power proposed for the Scottish Constitutional Convention's scheme
for a Parliament, and throughout yesterday he treated the proposed 3p power as
if its implementation in full was inevitable.
``What did the Scots do to deserve the imposition of a tax on devolution that
even Labour says will not be levied on Wales?'' he asked. ``The tartan tax is
the most outrageous proposal to come from any political party in a generation.''
He said the planned tax was highly regressive and added: ``We aim to win this
argument. I aim to ensure that the people of Scotland do not sleepwalk into
separatism.''

<TEXT>
THE Government is facing a battle over its divorce law reforms, after divisions
were exposed last night in the Lords on the Family Law Bill.
The legislation for England and Wales is backed by the bishops but opposed by a
cross-party group of ``pro-family'' peers. It ends the so-called ``quickie''
divorce, introduces ``no-fault'' divorces and imposes a 12-month cooling off
period after the start of divorce proceedings.
The measure also revives, in amended form, the Government's proposals to
strengthen protection for victims of domestic violence.
Leading criticism of the divorce reforms in last night's second reading debate,
Tory former Lords Leader Baroness Young gave notice that strenuous efforts
would be made to change the legislation in the committee stage.
She told the House: ``I shall be putting down amendments which I hope will have
the effect of trying to buttress marriage because that's what we ought to be
talking about - not just picking up the pieces, which is what I think this Bill
does.''
Lady Young added she hoped many improvements could be made to the Bill in the
Lords before it went to the Commons.
She claimed that by removing fault from divorce, the state was ``actively
discouraging any concept of lifelong commitment in marriage'' and undermining
the legal basis of marriage by ``making the contract meaningless''.
Opening the debate, Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern declared his
belief that marriage should be for life.
``I personally would not wish to see people divorced at all,'' Lord Mackay
said. ``I believe that marriage should be for life. This is an ideal, I
believe, which most couples who marry strive for.
``It is this ideal which provides the most stable and secure background for the
birth and development of children.
``I would prefer that spouses remain united until God separated them by death.''
However, Lord Mackay continued: ``I have to recognise that marriages do break
down and the civil legislator must take account of this fact and provide the
best framework of law to do this.''
Most peers in the debate were overwhelmingly in favour of the divorce reforms
in principle, but some voiced particular concern that measures should be taken
to buttress marriage.
Former Chief Rabbi Lord Jakobovits said that with some 150,000 divorces a year,
marriage was now a ``national disaster area'' to which the Government should
respond with the same energy devoted to the Aids epidemic when it first struck.
He protested: ``This Bill, by its emphasis on easing divorce rather than on
strengthening marriage, seems to accept the massive break-up of marriages as if
it were inescapable.''
Lord Marsh (Ind.) predicted a hard-fought committee stage for the Bill in the
Lords on the basis of the ``depth of differences'' voiced by peers on the issue
of divorce.
Lord Mackay emphasised his willingness to consider amendments to the Bill.

A PROFESSOR of economics has accused Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth of
scaremongering over the ``tartan tax'' proposed for a Scottish parliament.
The doomsday scenario that Mr Forsyth claims would follow the imposition of a
3p-in-the-pound increase in income tax is, says Professor Douglas Mair, of
Heriot-Watt University, ``quite deliberate and political''.
The professor, who has spent five years studying the long-term effect that a
tartan tax would have on the Scottish economy said yesterday: ``Mr Forsyth has
a degree in economics and he ought to know better. He is simply
scare-mongering.''
Nor does he give comfort to the opposing camp who see the proposed extra tax
levy - to a maximum of 3p - as being without flaw.
Says Professor Mair, who has produced his study in conjunction with Dr Tony
Laramie, of Merrimack College in Massachusetts: ``It is misleading, even
mischievous, to claim that the introduction of the tartan tax will have
exclusively harmful or beneficial effects on the Scottish economy.''
Professor Mair and Dr Laramie stress that the so-called tartan tax is not a
black-and-white issue.
They concede that their proposal to move away from conventional means of
managing the economy will not eliminate business cycles.
But extreme swings from boom to bust and back again would, they say, be
flattened out, helping to stabilise the economy.
Professor Mair claims that their researches into the effect of a tartan tax
have been ``exhaustive and rigorous'', that their proposal is ``well thought
through'', and that they have produced a revolutionary new approach to the
study of the effects of taxes.
Working on the basis of the so-called ``worst case scenario'' - that a Scottish
parliament would raise the standard rate of income tax in Scotland by the full
3p - they argue that the level of taxation on its own does not affect the level
of national income. Two things, they say, change the level of national income -
change in the distribution of income brought about by tax increases and the
impact of the tax change on investment.
An increase in the standard rate of income tax in Scotland and the effect
brought about through a change in the distribution of income would have two
sets of effects which largely offset each other, they argue.
There would be a fall in the aggregate level of consumption as a result of the
fall in after-tax incomes. However, because there would have been a
corresponding increase in the spending of the Scottish parliament, a balanced
budget would offset the fall in consumption ``and may even bring about a net
increase in national income in Scotland''.
Professor Mair said yesterday: ``We calculate that if the long run trend of
investment in Scotland was zero then the introduction of the tartan tax would
have the effect of slowing down the rate of growth in investment during the
upswing of the business cycle but accelerate it during the downswing of the
cycle.''

TELEVISION licence fees will rise from next April by #3.50 to #90 for colour
and by #1.50 to #30 for black and white, National Heritage Minister Iain Sproat
announced last night.
He said in a Commons written reply: ``Licence fee increases are based on the
annual Retail Price Index figure as at the previous September. Application of
the RPI figure of 3.9% for the year to September 1995 to the current unrounded
licence fees produces new rounded totals of #90 for a colour licence and #30
for a black and white licence.''
After a review in 1993, the Government decided that, for the remaining three
years of the current BBC Charter, changes in the licence fee should continue to
be set at the inflation level.
Before deciding the level of the licence fee from April 1997, the Government
will review the RPI formula. The continued use of the licence fee to fund the
BBC will be reviewed before the end of 2001.

THIS summer saw the ``Battle of the Bands'' with popsters Blur and Oasis
fighting out for the number one spot in the charts. While political parallels
are hard to come by outside of a General Election, this year's St Andrew's Day
``Battle of the Parties'' over the future of Scottish government comes close.
We now have a clear picture of the constitutional stalls being laid out by all
the major political parties in Scotland.
It has been a significant week for Scottish politics. In particular, the
announcements by the Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, on ``strengthening
the Union through real devolution'' have given the first real hints that the
Tories are seriously under pressure over the manner in which Scotland is
governed.
Since Mr Forsyth has found himself in the hot seat in the Scottish Office, he
has launched a number of initiatives aimed at addressing both the Tories' poor
poll ratings and the workings of Scottish decision-making.
However, he finds himself in a difficult position of having to come up with
something new, while for so long the Tories have said all is well. With the
Scottish Constitutional Convention plans now on the table he is in the position
of having to follow the agenda set by the opposition parties rather than
forging his own.
But the plans will have the effect of turning the spotlight even more brightly
on how little impact the elected representatives of Scotland currently have in
Scottish decision-making.
For example, the plans to extend the remit of the Scottish Grand Committee give
the Tories two new problems. Firstly, they will not only have to justify their
position on any Scottish legislation but will also have to justify why certain
Bills will go before the Grand Committee and others will not. Under the glare
of the opposition and the Scottish media, this is an impossible task to achieve
without further criticism being generated.
Secondly, these plans are an own-goal as far the Tory insistence on an answer
to the ``West Lothian Question'' goes. It will allow Scottish MPs to vote on
Scottish legislation while allowing those self-same MPs to vote on equivalent
measures for England and Wales. Mr Forsyth has been pushing the issue of the
West Lothian question in recent months and yet his plans actually pose that
very question themselves.
Opposition responses to these plans have bordered on the derisive. Yet none of
the opposition parties can guarantee having the last laugh in the run up to the
General Election. Both the SNP and Labour together with the Liberal Democrats
have now put detailed plans before the people of Scotland. In 1992, despite the
attention focused on the constitutional issue, details were rather thin on the
ground. The need to be able to argue the constitutional case in detail as well
as in principle will be a guiding feature of the next election campaign.
Mr Salmond desperately needs to take votes from Labour to make any impact, but
his party's support is back into the mid-20% bracket, down from the 30%
achieved in last year's Euro elections. With Labour surging ahead in British
terms it may well be the case that the Scottish electorate's attentions are
focused more on a possible win for Tony Blair rather than being ready for a win
for the SNP.
So far, Mr Forsyth can be judged favourably on his ability to keep a grip on
the Scottish Office's allocation in last Tuesday's Budget. There was
considerable pressure to slice Scottish spending. Yet this is not the stuff of
electoral appeal. Nor is the pressure being put on Scottish local government in
the run up to the introduction of the new councils next April.
The constitutional issue has struck a chord with Mr Forsyth in his attack on
devolution tax raising powers, the so-called ``Tartan Tax''. Yet with the
general trust of voters in the Tories on the economy and tax at a post-war low,
the tax issue is likely to have resonance only in the Scottish business
community.
Michael Forsyth will require all his robustness to continue the battle in
Scotland. But it is difficult to see how he can succeed where his predecessors
have failed. Even a full scale U-turn on devolution would not be enough.

A VOTE by the Church of England's ruling body on a report which claims that
living in sin is no longer sinful may give fresh impetus to the Church of
Scotland to reach a position on relationships outside marriage, it was claimed
last night.
Mrs Elizabeth Templeton, convener of the Church of Scotland's working party on
marriage for the board of doctrine, said last night that, every time the issue
of relationships outside marriage went through a church's court, it increased
pressure on other churches to take a stand on the issue.
Her comments followed a warning by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George
Carey, that ``cohabitation was no substitution for marriage''. Dr Carey also
called for the Church to be ``uncompromising'' in upholding the values of
marital fidelity.
Until now, the Church of Scotland has drawn back from voting on a report,
prepared for the General Assembly in 1994, which recommended it was time the
Church took seriously the position of people who had decided to participate in
alternative relationships. It provoked very sharp dissent from some members of
the Church and no vote was taken.
That same report has recently been reissued to congregations, Kirk sessions and
presbyteries for their consideration, but no time limit has been set for a
response.
``It will come up when some committee calls for a fixed vote. I think there are
people who would like a vote from both ends of the spectrum, and people who
would like there not to be one, as any decision would be premature or
divisive,'' Mrs Templeton said.
She added that both the United Reform Church and the Methodist Church had
decided that people who were in long-term committed homosexual or heterosexual
relationships were welcome as members.
Father Noel Barry, speaking on behalf of Cardinal Thomas Winning, head of the
Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, said: ``The position of the Roman Catholic
Church is that there is no substitute for marriage in terms of relationships.
Nothing less than marriage would be acceptable.''
In a stormy debate at the Church of England's General Synod yesterday, members
voted to ``take note'' of the report while restating the Church's commitment to
marriage. The Synod also cited the variety of family relationships.
Opening the debate, the Bishop of Liverpool, Dr David Sheppard, threw his
weight behind the report, but warned people to see it in its whole context. He
believed it did not say cohabitation had the same moral value as marriage,
which was ``God's proper and best way''.
Warning against stifling public debate, he said it was important ``to try to
offer a word to those who may be in irregular partnerships''. This was quite
different from encouraging people to have casual relationships.
In stark contrast, Dr Carey said he was ``very disappointed'' with the report,
which did not focus strongly enough on the impact of family life based on a
husband and wife in a permanent, loving relationship.
This ideal had run through the Bible from the story of Adam and Eve to later
stories in the New Testament.
Cohabitation was not and could not be marriage in all but name, he added.
Marriage was a ceremony involving a recognition from wider society. Those who
chose to cohabit on the grounds that their relationship was a private matter
and nothing to do with society were ``frankly deluding themselves''.
Mrs Christine McMullen, from Derby, a member of the working party which drew up
the report, described it as ``gentle, affirming, tolerant and honest''. It
searched for the truth of the family and did not claim to offer the whole truth.
The report said marriage was the best place for children to be reared but did
not despise those who had different arrangements. Mrs McMullen added it gave
meaning to life in a largely meaningless world.

HOME Secretary Michael Howard denied yesterday that his ability to exclude
suspected terrorists from Britain had been undermined by a ruling of the
European Court of Justice.
Ruling in favour of former republican activist John Gallagher, who was excluded
from Britain as a suspected terrorist, the Court stated that the operation of
the Prevention of Terrorism Act was in breach of freedom of movement guaranteed
by the Treaty of Rome.
The ruling opens the door to possible compensation claims from other Irish
citizens kept out of the UK under the Home Secretary's special powers.
As angry Conservative MPs bitterly attacked the ruling, Mr Howard said that did
not affect the substance of his power to continue issuing banning orders but
only the procedures which had to be followed in operating it.
Mr Howard said: ``As far as I can see, the only likely effect of it is that
those who are subject to it are likely to be detained in custody in consequence
instead of being allowed to leave the country while an exclusion order is being
considered.''
He said he was confident he would successfully resist any claim for
compensation that was made.
However, former Home Office Minister Charles Wardle (Bexhill and Battle - Con.)
said the European Court had ``made a mockery'' of the exclusion order decisions
and wondered what the court would do with Britain's internal frontier controls.
Mr Howard told him the government remained determined to retain frontier
controls.
Sir Ivan Lawrence (Burton - Con.), chairman of the Home Affairs Select
Committee, said life was becoming impossible for Ministers, whose every
decision was becoming subject to judicial review and urged that consideration
be given to reducing the opportunities for this.
Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East - Con.), who said it was ``a terribly serious
issue'', demanded to know if it was true the Government would have to give
compensation from taxpayers' funds to those excluded from Britain on grounds of
national security.
He asked how the Government explained the decision after the assurances given
during the passage of the Maastricht Act that security was a matter entirely
for the British Government.
Mr Howard said be very much regretted the court decision but it did not go to
the substance of his powers.
Liberal Democrat lawyer Alex Carlile (Montgomery) accused the critics of
``babbling,'' and said the decision did not undermine the PTA provisions ``in
any significant way.''
Mr John Greenway (Ryedale - Con.) claimed that the sovereignty of the Commons
was at risk, but Mr Howard said that while he would be concerned if that was
the case the judgment simply made a limited criticism of some of the procedures
and said these could be updated ``without any difficulty.''
Ealier, Sir Teddy Taylor said outside the Commons: ``This is one of the most
frightening decisions we've ever heard.
``It seems appalling that the non-elected European Court is telling the British
Government not only how to operate on terrorism, but how not to.''
He added: ``At some stage, the Government is going to have to tell this court
to take a running jump.''
The Home Office said it would study the details of the ruling but had no
intention of scrapping the Act.
``We shall consider very carefully the implications of this judgment. But it is
clear that it does not question the power to make exclusion orders - it
addresses only the procedures involved in making them,'' a spokesman said.
``The power to exclude remains an important weapon in our counter-terrorist
armoury. We don't propose to surrender that weapon until it is completely safe
to do so.''
The court's ruling said the Prevention of Terrorism Act was subject to a 1964
EU directive which stated that national authorities cannot, except in
emergencies, issue exclusion orders to foreign nationals ``before a competent
authority has given its opinion''.
The ``competent authority'' can be appointed by the government, as long as it
has ``absolute independence'' and is not subject to ``any control'' from the
government, says the directive.
That provision is not honoured by the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the
Luxembourg judges ruled.
``Member states are entitled to make exclusion orders. This case has been about
the procedures and process of doing so,'' a court official said.
Donegal-born Gallagher, 35, was arrested in London in September 1991 and served
with an exclusion order. He was deported to Ireland three days later.
After he was expelled Gallagher wrote to the Home Office insisting on a
personal interview with someone nominated by the Home Secretary.
The interview took place in the British Embassy in Dublin in December 1991, but
the nominee did not identify himself and provided no information about the
grounds for Gallagher's exclusion. Gallagher then took his case to the Court of
Appeal, which referred it to Luxembourg for a ruling.

THE Prime Minister defended the immigration service in the Commons yesterday
against allegations that it had deported a sick three-year-old girl with her
mother.
Mr Major said during Question Time that immigration cases were ``examined with
compassion'' and that the child must have been deported because her mother was
an illegal immigrant.
The issue was raised by Labour MP Janner (Leicester West). He told the House
about one of his constituents, British-born three-year-old Jasmine Sorabjee. Mr
Janner said she was ill and claimed the Home Office had deported her and her
mother Scheherazade Sorabjee, a Kenyan Asian, to Kenya.
Mrs Sorabjee's plight arises from Britain's refusal to afford protected
immigration status to parents of its own citizens who are still minors, in
contrast to other EU members.
Mr Janner asked the Prime Minister: ``Is this not a cruel and disgraceful
decision, totally devoid of compassion, and showing the absolutely disgraceful
way this Government is abusing immigration rules?''
To howls of protest from the Labour benches, Mr Major said: ``There are very
strict ways these matters are examined, they are examined with compassion,
without any shadow of doubt and the person removed from this country, although
I have no details of the particular case, would have been the parent who
presumably was an illegal immigrant.''

A MAJOR research programme into pre-senile Alzheimer's Disease has found that
it is more prevalent in Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and Edinburgh than other
areas of Scotland, and that having a father who was a coal miner or who was an
older father increases the risk.
The research by Professor Lawrence Whalley and colleagues at Aberdeen
University involved the only national sample in the world, which was also the
biggest sample so far. It involved 450 Alzheimer patients between 1974 and 1988
and 1784 early dementia cases.
One of the key findings is that, in Scotland, the distribution of Alzheimer's
Disease is not random.
``There are pockets of high incidence,'' Professor Whalley said yesterday.
``They are in North Lanarkshire and the major conurbations of Edinburgh and
Glasgow.
``We have tested these pockets and they are real pockets and are not just
caused by a variation in diagnosis which would account for a higher than
expected incidence.
``We then tried to explain them and looked at what we knew about the people in
these areas.''
The researchers were looking at whether increased parental age was a factor
because it has been previously established that virtually everyone with Down's
Syndrome gets Alzheimer's Disease before the age of 40, and Down's Syndrome is
associated with increased maternal age.
Because of Scotland's history in public health, the researchers were able to
consult comprehensive records of disease and they were also able to check
marriage records.
``We found that there was increased parental age, but it was their fathers who
were increased in age, and it was only their sons who were affected,'' he said.
``This is very important because there are other diseases which show this
particular phenomena in medicine.
``It is always assumed that, although women should be wary about having
children as they grow older, men can go on fathering children until they get to
Charlie Chaplin's age. This may not be the case.''
He said that about 10% of the male Alzheimer's patients could be accounted for
by increased paternal age. The association of having a coal miner for a father
was quite unexpected and is not specific for Alzheimer's Disease, just for
dementia.
``When these people were born between 1915 and 1925, about 10% of Scotland's
male working population were coal miners,'' said Professor Whalley.
``These people lived in considerable poverty, often in small villages away from
towns and cities and with very little in the way of alternative employment.''
He said that those pioneering public health medicine in Scotland went out to
these villages and discovered that the miners topped every league table ever
drawn up for diseases, and their children were the same. Infant mortality was
as high as 30%.
Professor Whalley said the coal miners' children subsequently migrated into the
big cities, which probably explains the high incidence of Alzheimer's in
central Scotland.
He said the deficient nutrition of these children during pregnancy and in the
early years of their lives may have affected their ``cerebral reserve'' and
reduced their capacity to cope with even the mildest Alzheimer's. ``The
nutrition and education you receive shape up your brain's adaptive capacity,''
he said.
Professor Whalley added that they knew from the records of the medical officers
of health that these children experienced extreme poverty growing up in the
central belt around the time of the First World War, and they suspect that may
be the link which explains the high incidence of the condition.
Those children who survived the deprivation are more likely to get Alzheimer's
Disease. ``We already know from other studies that children who grow up in
poverty are much more likely to get vascular disease,'' he said.
``The next step is to try to identify the components that could be causing
this. The one we are particularly interested in is nutrition and ageing.''

THE rise in the number of single parent families is slowing in the 1990s while
more people are living alone, a survey published yesterday shows.
Living trends in Britain are revealed in the Office of Population Censuses and
Surveys' general household survey for 1994.
It shows the proportion of families with dependent children headed by single
parents remained at 22% between 1993 and last year.
But the number of people living alone continued to rise and accounted for 27%
of households last year. When the survey was first published in 1971 they made
up just 17%.
The average family size is 2.4 people, which has declined from 2.9 in the early
1970s.
Other key findings include news that the gap between men and women smokers has
narrowed. In 1994 28% of men smoked compared with 26% of women, but 20 years
ago half of all men smoked and just over 40% of women.
As far as alcohol is concerned, one in four men drink more than the recommended
maximum level of 21 units a week while 13% of women knock back more than their
recommended 14 units a week.
The survey was taken by questioning 18,000 people from more than 9700
households across the country between April 1994 and March this year.
It also found that we continue to buy more consumer goods with the greatest
increase from 1993 in the number of CD players from 39% to 47% of families.
The kitchens of 67% of households now have microwave ovens and 19% have a
dishwasher.
Only one in five households are council tenants compared with one in three in
1983.
But renting from the private sector has risen from 7% of households in 1991 to
9% last year.

NOBODY called it a ``wee sleekit, cowrin', timorous beastie'' which, as they
were all Welsh, was perhaps not surprising. But they got close.
Ieuan Win Jones (Ynys Mon - Welsh Nationalist), inhibited by not being allowed
Welsh, called it ``a timid little mouse,'' which showed up English as lacking
the virility of a Scots accent.
Mr Donald Anderson (Swansea East - Lab.) said that, after 17 years' reflection
on devolution, the Government had produced ``the longest recorded gestation
period of a mouse''.
Mr William Hague, Welsh Secretary, was presenting his policy for expanding the
activities of the Welsh Grand Committee following in the footsteps of Mr
Michael Forsyth the day before. ``Major to be quizzed in Bangor'' will be a
headline to match ``Heseltine questioned in Stornoway''.
The proposals went down with the same dull thud as those for Scotland - not
surprising, considering that the MPs giving them the thumbs-down have what they
consider infinitely superior plans of their own for their native lands.
However, the whole affair was much less combative. Mr Forsyth, even when
striving to be ecumenical, cannot it seems avoid stirring up fiery passions in
his opponents.
Mr Hague, though sharp, has a more amiable political personality.
The Opposition parties were prepared to tell him his ideas were no good without
evincing any strong desire to see him twisting in the wind. Rather like Mr
Major, Mr Hague is a politician it is hard to be angry with.
The unkindest cut came from Labour spokesman Rhodri Morgan, who suggested that
the Secretary of State had peaked as a speaker at the age of 16 when, readers
will recall, he transfixed a Tory Party conference with his youthful oratory.
Unlike Mr George Robertson, who fell over himself in denunciatory vigour, Mr
Ron Davies, the Welsh Shadow, admitted the idea was ``novel'', just not much
use.
Mr Alex Carlile, for the Liberal Democrats, contented himself with ``paltry and
miserable,'' and Mrs Ann Clywd (Cynon Valley - Lab.) said it was ``a
meaningless sop''.
A few hastily summoned English Tories asked what sounded like suspiciously
planted questions about how the Welsh would be enthused by seeing more of their
Grand Committee and what a treat it would be for them to be visited by the
likes of Messrs Major and Clarke.
There were calls for ``a real parliament,'' although, perhaps warned by the
experience of their Scottish conferences, nobody called for taxing powers.
According to Mr Alan Williams (Swansea West - Lab.), 99% of the Welsh
population are in the blissful state of not knowing the Welsh Grand Committee
exists. Mr Hague's travelling circus could well cut that to 95%.
This Tory devolution bid, declared Mr Morgan, was as meaningless as King Edward
I making his son the first Prince of Wales. King Edward also made John Balliol
King of Scotland. Presumably, George Robertson, Jim Wallace, and Alex Salmond
can make something of that.

SCOTLAND'S industrial leaders say the ``hard economic facts'' of devolution
should be made available to them.
Mr Andrew Cubie, chairman of the CBI Scotland, warned that businesses would not
tolerate any increase in the cost of government in Scotland if devolution
became a reality.
About 43% of Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) currently goes to the
Government, according to Mr Cubie, when in fact the CBI believed it should be
under 40%.
``Scottish business can demand that hard economic facts should be made
available to us,'' said Mr Cubie.
``We do not have sufficient economic information to make a judgment on
devolution.''

LABOUR Chief Whip Donald Dewar has summoned MP Keith Vaz to explain remarks in
a television interview in which he allegedly questioned the need for a white
man to be given a local council post.
Mr Vaz, 49, is MP for Leicester East and a Front Bench spokesman on inner-city
affairs. Speculation was growing at Westminister last night that he may be
asked to resign his post after Tory MPs seized on the incident at Prime
Minister's Questions.
Tory Party chairman Brian Mawhinney yesterday wrote to Labour leader Tony Blair
demanding that Mr Vaz be sacked ``in support of the view that we both hold that
there can be no excuse for racism in public life.''
According to Dr Mawhinney, Mr Vaz is quoted in an upcoming Dispatches programme
on Channel 4 as saying of a candidate for the post of deputy leader of
Leicester Council ``why should we have a white person?''
A Labour spokesman said no decision would be taken until the matter was
discussed, and Mr Vaz had had the chance to explain himself.

THE Queen made history when she attended a full service in a Roman Catholic
church yesterday.
The Duchess of Kent, a Catholic convert, was also present for the ecumenical
service at Westminster Cathedral.
Minority Protestant demonstrators jeered as the Queen, who is head of the
Church of England, arrived for the 45-minute service.
Led into the cathedral by Cardinal Basil Hume, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of
Westminster, the Queen was greeted by the 1500-strong congregation which broke
into warm and spontaneous applause.
The service was also attended by Dr George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and representatives of other Christian faiths - there was no Mass.
Buckingham Palace said it was ``an appropriate decision for the times'' that
the 100th anniversary of Westminster Cathedral should be celebrated at an
ecumenical service with the Queen present.
Cardinal Hume, in his homily, welcomed the Queen.
``In 1982, Your Majesty received Pope John Paul into your London home,'' he
said. ``That was for us the healing of many ancient wounds and we were so
grateful for that.''
The Queen's presence was ``a further affirmation of the place that we Catholics
have in the nation'', added Cardinal Hume.
The Queen sat at the front of the nave on a specially-carved chair made of
rosewood and emblazoned with a mother-of-pearl rose of England and the Cross of
St George.
The congregation and choir sang much of the service in Latin but ended with God
Save the Queen in English.
Outside small groups of protesters, among the 500 to 600-strong crowd, handed
out leaflets and preached impromptu sermons.
Reformed Baptist Michael Hobbis, holding a banner declaring The Just Shall Live
by Faith, said: ``The Queen is breaking her coronation vows and making a
mockery of the martyrs of the Reformation.
``The Archbishop of Canterbury ought not to have advised Her Majesty to attend
Vespers at Westminster Cathedral, and Her Majesty, as keeper of her own
conscience as she will answer before Almighty God, ought not to attend.''
q THE Queen Mother has been advised by doctors to stay in hospital for a few
more days to complete her recovery, Buckingham Palace said yesterday.
She had made ``excellent progress'' following her hip replacement operation two
weeks ago, said a palace spokesman.
It was not possible to give a precise date when the Queen Mother, 95, would
leave the King Edward VII Hospital for Officers in London, he added.

SCOTLAND'S first ``right to die'' case has been delayed by the illness of the
Lord Advocate.
Because of the ``substantial importance'' of the issues involved in the case,
the Lord Advocate, Mr Donald Mackay QC, wishes to appear in person to state the
Crown's position.
At the Court of Session yesterday, Lord Cameron was informed that the Lord
Advocate was unwell and would be unable to appear.
The judge agreed to adjourn the case brought by the Law Hospital NHS Trust
until Mr Mackay can appear in person. No date for a new hearing has yet been
fixed.
Lord Cameron is being asked to declare that doctors can lawfully discontinue
life-saving treatment for 52-year-old Mrs Janet Johnstone.
Mrs Johnstone, from Houldsworth Crescent, Allanton, Lanarkshire, has been in a
coma after taking a drugs overdose in January 1992. She can breathe on her own
but has to be fed through a nasal tube.
Five doctors have confirmed that she is in a persistent vegetative state with
no prospect of recovery and the hospital's application to let her die with
dignity is supported by her immediate family.
In his written defences to the case, the Lord Advocate is arguing that since
the case raises criminal law issues of murder and culpable homicide, the Court
of Session, a civil court, has no jurisdiction to hear it.
A curator appointed to look after Mrs Johnstone's interests is also opposing
the hospital's application.

<HEADLINE>Stamp prices set to rise as Treasury raids PO till</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE price of stamps is set to rise by a penny next year - and Post Office
chiefs say the Government is to blame.
Mail bosses, who are also refusing to rule out job cuts, say Treasury Ministers
have dramatically increased the amount they annually claim from the PO.
As a result, hopes that a price freeze imposed in late 1993 could be extended
to at least March had been ``inevitably called into question'', warned PO chief
executive John Roberts.
Labour says the Government's move amounts to a new ``stamp duty'' to make up
for the tax cuts it announced in Tuesday's Budget.
Ministers had set the annual dividend it claims from the Post Office at #178m
for each of the next three financial years.
But that has been increased, as a result of Tuesday's Budget, to nearly #300m
in the first year and more than #300m in the next two years.
Post Office officials said they would now have to hand over nearly #1000m in
the next three years - about as much as they had paid in the last 10.
And that was on top of the #110m a year the organisation pays in tax, added a
spokesman.
The upshot was that the Post Office was being ``squeezed'' and would have to
find ways of raising more cash, said Mr Roberts.
``The Government has its job to do and we have ours. We would be failing in our
duty to the customer if we did not make clear the implications of these
figures,'' he added.
Mr Roberts said customers should brace themselves for a 1p rise on first and
second-class rates in the spring. A first-class stamp is currently 25p and a
second 19p.
Shadow Trade Secretary Margaret Beckett said what the Government had given away
in tax cuts in one hand on Tuesday it was now taking back with another.
``A new Tory stamp tax has been exposed,'' she said. ``They're demanding
another million pounds a day from the Post Office.''
The Union of Communication Workers said the Government's decision could result
in the PO going into the red for the first time in 20 years.
In June, PO bosses announced record pre-tax profits of #472m. It has also shed
about 10,000 jobs in the last four years.
The PO warning comes months after former Trade President Michael Heseltine
failed to privatise the organisation.
Mail bosses wanted privatisation because they said the financial demands made
by Government were making it increasingly difficult to fight off competition
from privatised foreign operations.
Mr Heseltine indicated he would aim to give the organisation more commercial
freedom within Government ownership.
But the increase in Government cash demands would appear to be a complete
reversal of that policy.

<HEADLINE>Chancellor admits extra cash for families does not all come from tax cuts Labour seizes on Clarke `gaffe'</HEADLINE>

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke last night was caught up in a row with Labour over
claims that the Budget would leave average families #9 a week better off.
He was forced to admit that more than half the extra cash in their pockets next
year would come from pay increases - and not through Budget tax cuts.
In what Labour hailed as a double ``gaffe,'' Mr Clarke also appeared to admit
that Tory policies had done little to increase the income of ordinary families
in the 1990s.
Labour leader Tony Blair challenged the Prime Minister at Commons Questions to
admit that #7 of the claimed #9 a week post-Budget increase in family income
was down to wage rises that would have happened anyway.
``The real Budget figure is just #2 and that's not taking account of extra
costs and charges,'' he said.
Mr Major insisted that it was the Government's ``expectation'' that family
incomes would rise by around #450 a year - or #9 a week - but sidestepped
repeating the claim made by Tory chairman Brian Mawhinney that the increase was
the direct result of the Budget.
In a letter to Mr Blair, the Chancellor drove the point home, but added
significantly: ``This increase is attributable both to tax reductions and
growth in real earnings.
``Budget tax changes will leave such a family #190 a year better off in cash
terms.
``As a result of the growth in the economy which this Government's policies
have secured, earnings growth is expected to bring the overall increase in real
take-home pay up to #450.''
Labour has insisted since the Budget that Tory claims for increased income were
false and party leaders seized on the letter as clear vindication.
Deputy leader John Prescott said: ``The Budget is unravelling hour by hour.
First the Prime Minister is forced to admit the so-called #9 a week Budget is
merely an expectation, now the Chancellor is forced to admit that the bulk of
this #9 is made up of a rosy estimation of wage rises and economic growth.
``The truth is you can't trust their claims for inflation, for growth or for
pay rises. They are incapable of running an economy and they are incapable of
telling the truth about tax.''
Mr Clarke was embroiled in a separate row after appearing to admit that
ordinary families were no better off under Tory rule after being hard hit by
the recession.
``As Chancellor, I have come along with a healing economy and a recovering
economy and we are recovering very well,'' he told Jimmy Young on BBC Radio 2.
``The trouble is the British public don't feel much benefit. Their family
incomes are not any better than they were really.''
However, he insisted that economic recovery was now among the strongest in the
world and said families would ``keep more of what they earn and more of what
they save'' as a result of his tax-cutting financial package on Tuesday.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said the remarks were proof that Tory policies
had failed ordinary families despite the #9-a-week claim.
``Now we find the Chancellor having to tell the truth that family incomes are
no better than they were,'' he said.
In the Commons, Mr Blair asked Mr Major: ``Will you confirm that of this #9,
almost #7 has nothing to do with the Budget but to do with the Conservatives'
projection of wage increases next year?''
Mr Major said: ``You made a whole series of comments in replying to the Budget
- the vast majority of which were specious, or wrong or misleading.
``If you care to examine them, you will find that those that were not wrong
were misleading and those that were not misleading were wrong.
``What Dr Mawhinney said is that people will be better off next year by #450
and that is our expectation.''

THE Government is to introduce a code of practice to cover the use of material
from closed-circuit television cameras, Home Office Minister of State David
Maclean said yesterday. The move follows concern over a video compilation
called Caught In The Act!, which included shots of a couple having sex in a
lift. The video went on sale earlier this week but was withdrawn after protests.
Mr Maclean told the Commons that a ``key condition'' of Government funding for
any CCTV cameras for security purposes would be a code of practice on ``the
proper use'' of videotapes.
Mr Henry Bellingham (Norfolk North-West - Con.) cited the ``bizarre and
worrying'' recent case where one of his constituents bought 20 police interview
tapes, marked Essex and Cambridgeshire Constabulary, at a car boot sale.
``This contained highly confidential information including an interview of a
schoolmaster who was alleged to have interfered with a choirboy.''
Mr Alun Michael, for the Opposition, said it would be tragic if public
confidence in surveillance cameras was undermined by people selling off
material from the films.
Mr Maclean replied: ``Let us be careful not to hype up these episodes. We do
not want to regulate out sensible use of pictures by hasty measures because of
shoddy, poor quality, over-hyped films. The little that has been released is of
such poor quality that it is worse than Logie Baird's first pictures in 1925.
The public should condemn it by not buying this rubbish.''

A STAGE-managed but symbolic handshake between President Clinton and Sinn Fein
president Gerry Adams took place outside a Falls Road cafe yesterday.
The meeting, portrayed as a chance encounter, had clearly been deftly woven
into the President's busy schedule.
American sources indicated the meeting was arranged late last night.
Mr Clinton was driving through the nationalist stronghold when his cavalcade
stopped outside McErleans Bakery.
Mr Adams was inside with other members of his party. He went out on the
pavement and greeted the President with a handshake and the two men chatted
before they went inside.
Shop assistant Kathleen Mooney said: ``He (Mr Clinton) popped in all right - we
weren't expecting him.
``Gerry Adams was having a cup of tea, he was sitting with members of Sinn
Fein. He walked out and then he greeted the President as he got out of the car.
``President Clinton walked in and greeted us. He said he was very happy to be
in Belfast and he chatted to Gerry Adams,'' the assistant added.
Asked what he had told the President, Mr Adams told reporters: ``I gave him a
thousand welcomes.''
This is a traditional greeting in Gaelic - ``Mille Failte''.
Mr Clinton replied: ``Nice to see you. I look forward to seeing you this
evening.''
Afterwards Mr Adams said: ``He is obviously pleased to be here and enthused by
the reception of the people.''
The two men shook hands once before when the Sinn Fein president attended a
White House St Patrick's Day celebration in Washington this year.
Sinn Fein said it understood the President ``felt it was important to touch
base with everyone during his visit to Belfast''.
Immediately afterwards, the Sinn Fein leader went on to attend a lunch with US
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and US Education Secretary Dick Riley.

SCOTLAND'S D-Day was how Canon Kenyon Wright described yesterday's public
launch of the Scottish Constitutional Convention's proposals for a Scottish
Parliament.
``The victory is not won. There are hard battles ahead, but we sense that the
decisive turning point has come; the result is no longer in serious doubt,'' he
told a gathering in the Church of Scotland's General Assembly Hall in Edinburgh.
It was billed as a civic and cultural celebration to launch the document
``Scotland's Parliament - Scotland's Right'' to the people of Scotland.
There were speeches, of course, but also musical interludes, with songs in
Gaelic and an exuberant all-female drumming group, and a video showing sports
and arts personalities and members of the public endorsing the devolution
message.
The morning's celebration had begun with the reading of a proclamation at the
Mercat Cross in the High Street.
Acting as crier was Laurie Robertson, one of Edinburgh District Council's city
officers, who was flanked by the convention's co-chairmen, Lord Ewing of
Kirkford and Sir David Steel MP.
The call was to the people of Scotland to come to the Assembly Hall to witness
the signing of the agreed scheme for Scotland's parliament and to celebrate
this ``great step forward'' in establishing the parliament in Edinburgh.
Led by the Lothian and Borders Police Pipe Band, a selection of the great and
the good from Scottish political life (excluding the Tories or the SNP, of
course) the churches, the trade unions and other social groups all marched to
the Assembly Hall.
Once inside - with members of the public also present - there were some party
political points to be scored.
When Scottish Labour leader George Robertson spoke of ``one lot of politicians
who, over a single weekend, had abandoned the ``no change policy'' which had
united them for 16 years'' everyone knew he was talking about the Tories.
Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Jim Wallace MP called the Scottish Economic
Council, soon to be revamped under the Scottish Secretary's latest proposals,
``Michael's Mouse'', and Jean McFadden, who chairs the new Glasgow City
Council, said Tory plans for strengthening the Scottish Grand Committee would
have done nothing to stop the hated poll tax, whereas a Scottish parliament
would have done so.
Lord Ewing struck a sombre note too when he warned of ``a campaign of fear''
which he forecast would now be unleashed by the convention's enemies about the
consequences of the creation of a devolved Scottish parliament. They would try
to frighten the life out of the people of Scotland ``in the most disgraceful
fashion'' he claimed.
One Tory, in fact, was spotted in the audience - Alan Clark the maverick former
Defence Minister and author of the notorious diaries. He said his mission to
observe was journalistic rather than political.
``I don't think the Prime Minister would have chosen me to report back to
him,'' he chuckled.
Mr Clark, for the record, now says the arguments for change in Scotland are
very hard to resist, but he favours independence, not devolution.
The mood in the Assembly Hall was also one of satisfaction and rejoicing that,
after six years of debate and negotiation, the convention's scheme was now
complete and agreement had been reached between the Labour Party and the
Liberal Democrats on the shape of the new Scottish parliament.
In the Assembly Hall, the sight of George Robertson and Jim Wallace seated
together seemed to give tangible form to that constitutional alliance, and Sir
David Steel paid tribute to their leadership in bringing the long discussions
to a successful conclusion.
Details of the 129-seat body, 56 of whose members would be elected by a form of
proportional representation involving additonal members from party lists, had
already been publicised.
Jim Wallace said that the creation of a fairly-elected parliament ``was the
first and most obvious signal to the Scottish people that what we are trying to
create is something very different from the mock gothic pile on the banks of
the Thames.''
George Robertson said the accord reached between Labour and the Liberal
Democrats over the convention document was evidence of a new era in the
politics of Scotland. ``Not just words or ringing phrases. Not just hopes and
optimism.''
He went on ``Instead we present with dignity and integrity a detailed plan
worked on with pain and argument, time and travail, often mind-bending
attention to detail, and built solidly and effectively on consensus and common
sense.''
Speaking on behalf of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Jane McKay said that
one of the reasons why the parliament would make a difference was because women
would be involved equally with men in the decision-making process.
She referred to the unique agreement between Labour and the Liberal Democrats
which accepted the principle that there should be an equal number of men and
women as members of the parliament.
After all the members had signed the Convention's declaration to the sound of
the pipes it fell to Canon Wright, chairman of the executive commitee, to make
the final speech.
The canon wished he could be young again to be part of the reshaping of
Scotland. Young people, he stressed, had a crucial part to play in creating a
new society.
Later, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce gave an enthusiastic welcome to the
convention's contribution to the devolution debate.
Acting director general Peter Dunn said said he had been struck by the honesty,
sincerity and integrity of those who had presented the proposals .
q WHILE the ceremony was going ahead in Edinburgh, Mr Campbell Christie, the
STUC general secretary, was in Brussels for a simultaneous presentation.
He told a gathering of Scots in the Scotland Europa Centre that the Scottish
parliament would have strong ties with the European Union.
Liberal Democrat Graham Watson, who sits in the European Parliament for an
English seat, said the promised Scottish parliament was the result of six years
of talks and 250 years of struggle. ``This is a great day,'' he said. ``It will
be remembered for ever as a great day for Britain and a historic day for
Scotland.''

LIKE socially energetic newcomers to the neighbourhood, a couple called Clinton
moved into Northern Ireland yesterday to distribute calling cards around the
towns.
And in doing so the American President and First Lady have come closer than
anyone to snapping shut the door on a brutal past.
This was the day when history reasserted itself with a brighter face. A day
when, by simply stating the obvious, the world's most powerful citizen turned
mundanity into magic.
It happened through a peculiarly affecting brand of folksiness and
professionalism, and it happened also because on this occasion all sides were
uncommonly willing to listen, knowing that no other speechmaker could enrich
them with so much economic clout.
A factory on the peace line of Belfast was the first potent symbol of the day.
Here Bill Clinton, burly, shrewd and affable in that good guy American way
delivered his initial keynote address on this extraordinary Irish journey.
In a week when ``fudge'' as much as ``peace'' has been the word of the moment,
here was no fudge but a forceful, unambiguous vision, reminding politicians,
paramilitaries and every partisan throng that no single element had the
monopoly on terror: ``Engaging in honest dialogue is not an act of surrender.
It is an act of strength and commonsense.''
Around the world in most locations the self-evidence of that statement would
sound banal. Here in Mackie's vast, unprepossessing shed it already represented
one small victory in an odyssey of deadlock. If heeded, the message will bring
such unrivalled financial investment to Northern Ireland it will never again be
worth the bigot's while to ignore the benefits of social harmony.
That was the promise. Here are the words: ``We will stand with those who take
risks for peace in Northern Ireland. We will do all we can, through the
International Fund for Ireland and in many other ways, to ease your load. We
are entering an era of possibility unparalleled in all human history. If you
enter that era determined to build a new age of peace, the United States of
America will proudly stand by you.''
In one way that signal might almost be read as the speech of a benign
consul-general inspecting a neglected outpost. And maybe it is true that on the
far horizon all three governments involved in this story see Northern Ireland
as some kind of economic territory under the active but ``neutral'' dominion of
America's software imperialists.
In the end, however distant, only prosperity for all - as President Clinton
envisages it - would create round-table agreement for eventual British
withdrawal.
But if that is hurtling too speculatively into the future, it was still
remarkable that here in Northern Ireland there was an American head of state
bringing together representatives from two warring communities in a manner
British and Irish negotiators have never managed to achieve.
So, from the start it was a day of happy incongruity, beginning with the
President's spontaneous decision to halt his 40 limousine motorcade on the
Shankhill and enter a fruitshop where he announced to the stunned proprietor:
``Hi, I'm Bill Clinton and this is my wife Hillary.''
And while Violet Clarke was recovering, he purchased two apples - one red, one
green. Was that a conscious even-handed gesture? All through the visit the
President's sense of balance and attentiveness to tribal sensitivities has been
impressive, and as each venue yesterday proved such a celebratory occasion, one
set of usual protesters didn't seem to mind that he hadn't bought an orange.
But there was one audible voice of dissent. At Mackie's, originally a
Protestant factory but now with a mixed workforce re-establishing its name as a
world leader in light engineering diversity, Bill Clinton, without naming it
directly, put up a challenge to the British Government: ``You must be willing
to say to those who renounce violence, and who do take their own risks for
peace, that they are entitled to be full participants in the democratic
process. Those who show the courage to break with the past are entitled to
their stake in the future.''
There was little doubt that here was a reference to the paramilitaries, and
Sinn Fein in particular, a suggestion also that there should be no delay in
bringing all parties to the table, whatever the situation on the weapons issue.
And it was at this point that a lone voice cried: ``Never!'', only to be
drummed out by the audience's applause.
There was no easy treatment from the President for the merchants of
destruction: ``Your day is over. Violence has no place at the table of
democracy; no role in the future of this land.''
But if he was careful to praise Messrs Major and Bruton, Messrs Hume and
Trimble, and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and the Ulster Democratic Party's Gary
McMichael, there was conspicuously no mention of the Rev Ian Paisley. As for
that elusive handshake between Adams and Bill Clinton, it happened on the Falls
Road when the President stopped off for another spot of shopping, this time in
a bakery. Obviously a man addicted to the habit of American snacking. And there
by design was Adams, proffering an accepted hand and wishing Cead mile failte.
By the time the Clintons had reached Derry the mood in both cities had swelled
into one of rapturous festivity. Derry, by ancient lineage, has always been a
nationalist city, the city of Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney, the city of John
Hume, that man whom the President described as a ``tireless champion of civil
rights, its most eloquent voice of non-violence''. In what will now be called
the second Siege of Derry, tens of thousands crowded every approach to the
Guildhall in the shadow of the town's historical walls.
But despite the size of the welcome there remained something homely and
old-fashioned about it, the outdoor podium and battered municipal leather
chairs draped rather haphazardly with green beize, and the Guildhall Square
strung not with sophisticated laser decorations but Christmas lights which had
the dated look of pre-Troubles about them, as if they had been dragged down
from a dusty attic.
There was something touching about the simplicity of the event which culminated
in the President dedicating the Chair in Peace Studies at the University of
Ulster in memory of the late Tip O'Neill, one of America's outstanding
politicians and distinguished Irish-American. Something inevitable too, in the
choice of the President's favourite sing-along tunes, Phil Coulter's folk
anthem, The Town I Loved So Well.
But when Northern Ireland comes to remember this day it will be principally
because some sort of miracle happened: A tiny child called Catherine Hamill
standing on an improvised stage in a factory, telling the President of America
and all the world that her first daddy died in the Troubles ``and it was the
saddest day of my life, but my Christmas wish is that peace and love in Ireland
will last for ever''.
And when they come to recall Big Bill tomorrow and the day after, and the day
after that, it will be as a man who arrived as a conciliator but one of
forthright vision. A man impatient of overcoats, tough enough to stand in the
bitter wind on wounded ground, preferring to be exposed.

SCOTTISH CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION:
There will be 129 MPs - 73 elected from constituencies (Orkney and Shetland to
be separate) and the other 56 coming from party lists to ensure as far as
possible equal numbers of men and women and parties having the same percentage
of MPs as they have in the overall vote.
Each elector will be entitled to cast two votes - the first for a constituency
member and the second for a local party or group list of additional members.
The Parliament will take over the powers of the Scottish Office including
those over education, law, health, local government, training, transport,
planning, the environment and industry.
Westminster will be left with defence, foreign affairs, immigration, social
security policy and central economic policies.
The Parliament will be financed by an assigned budget along the present lines
from Westminster and will also have the ability to vary income tax up or down
by 3p in the pound.
It will meet in Edinburgh but with committee meetings throughout the rest of
Scotland so that the public can see it in action.
It will have a fixed term of four years with full-time MPs meeting during
normal working hours to avoid the kind of anti-social late-night sittings of
Westminster.
SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY:
The Queen and her successors to remain Head of State, but Chancellor of
Scotland, the elected presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament, will act in
this capacity in her absence. Role of monarchy to be redefined and limited.
Bill of Rights, incorporating provisions of European Human Rights Convention,
to guarantee fundamamental liberties including rights to housing, health,
education, ethnic minorities, freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
Extends to areas like language (official status for Gaelic alongside English)
and access to hills and mountains. All to be enforceable by law.
Single chamber of 200 MPs elected by proportional representation. Means to
defer contentious legislation and seek referendum or review by consultative
body. Scottish Prime Minister and Cabinet to run administration. Autonomy of
local government enshrined in constitution and elections on PR basis.
Guarantees for judiciary's independence from executive. Separate commission to
make appointments. Scottish courts final arbiters in all civil and criminal
matters, subject to appeals under European and international law.
Promotion of an Association of States of the British Isles, to include
England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Irish Republic to maintain existing
relationships and act together in areas of common interest. Continuing
membership of European Union, and adoption of Social Chapter. Scotland to
become 186th member of the United Nations.
THE GOVERNMENT:
The Scottish Grand Committee, which comprises all 72 Scottish MPs, will meet
more regularly throughout Scotland and will be attended by senior Ministers up
to the level of Premier.
Important legislation may, however, be steered past the committee, mainly by
appending Scottish changes on to UK legislation.
In any event, the Scottish Grand Committee in taking the second and third
readings of Bills will vote only technically - which means it will only record
the fact that it has held the debates. No actual vote accepting or rejecting
the Bill will be permitted.
The role and remit of the Scottish Economic Council will be extended, as
suggested by the STUC, but full details are still to come.
Powers stripped from local government will be handed back - of a 52-item
``shopping list'' proposed by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities
around half are likely to be agreed - mainly minor powers.
The key request of an end to capping powers on council spending has been
turned down.
Councils will now be given their whole budget in bigger tranches which leave
them to decide how to divide up their cake, rather than the past practice of
the Scottish Office specifying how the money will be targeted.

TWO children from opposite sides of Belfast's ``peace line'' made a poignant
and simple plea for a lasting peace yesterday.
President Clinton was visibly moved when the primary school children, a
Catholic girl and a Protestant boy, held hands to welcome him to Mackies
engineering factory in west Belfast.
Catherine Hamill, nine, told Mr Clinton that her first daddy had been killed
during the Troubles and that she wanted peace. ``My Christmas wish is that
peace and love will last in Ireland for ever,'' she said.
David Sterrett, 10, said that peace meant he could play in the park without
worrying about getting shot.
The children were selected to meet Mr Clinton after winning a ``Letter to the
President'' competition in a local newspaper. Their words stayed with the
President and he referred back to them time and again during his keynote speech.
The children read extracts from their letters to Mr Clinton before an audience
of hundreds of invited guests.
``My name is Catherine Hamill. My daddy works as an assistant at Stewarts
Warehouse. I live in Belfast. I love where I live.
``My first daddy died in the Troubles. It was the saddest day of my life. I
still think of him. Now it is nice and peaceful. I like having peace and quiet
for a change, instead of people shooting and killing.
``My Christmas wish is that peace and love will last in Ireland forever. Please
have a safe journey back to America. I hope you enjoyed your visit to Ireland.''
Catherine, from Forfar Street, on the nationalist side of the peace line, was
less than two years old when her father was killed.
Patrick Hamill was outside the house in which his daughter still lives when a
loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters gunman shot him on September 8, 1987, during a
period of vicious tit-for-tat killings.
Catherine attends St John's Primary School, close to her home, and her letter
was selected from those of 40 children at the school.
David Sterrett, from Clovelly Street, off the Springfield Road, who attends
Springfield Primary, told the President he lived in a mixed area of Catholics
and Protestants.
``We play football and races together. I want to thank you for coming to
Northern Ireland to help the peace process.
``I think the peace is great, because there is no shooting or bombing. It means
I can play in the park without worrying about getting shot.'' When Mr Clinton
began his own plea for a lasting peace he said: ``This is one of those
occasions when I really feel that all that needs to be said has already been
said.''
He said a big part of peace was children growing up safely, learning and
growing together.
Children played a big part in his visit to Belfast. Several hundred welcomed
him at Mackies.
One school beside the M2 motorway into the city gathered all its children in
ranks in the playground to wave as the motorcade sped by.
Catherine Hamill sat in her home last night, proudly watching television news
reruns of her big moment with the President.
She said Mr Clinton had told her that he was very proud of her for reading out
her letter.
``It was so exciting. I just kept thinking `Keep calm Catherine, keep calm',''
she said. ``My mum was so proud, so she was.''
She clutched her letter on which President Clinton had written a personal note:
``Catherine, this is a lovely statement. Thank you for joining me. Bill
Clinton.''
Her mother, Laura, who was in the audience at Mackies, said she cried as she
watched her daughter reading the letter.
``It was unbelievable. It was amazing when the President came out and sat
beside her.''
The letters from Catherine and David were the most moving part of his visit to
Ulster, the President said last night.
Speaking in Londonderry before returning to Belfast, he said: ``A lot of moving
things happened today. But the most moving thing was the two children who stood
and introduced me at the Mackies plant.
``They represented all those children who have written to me about what peace
means to them.''

THE giant strides made towards peace was symbolised last night by the President
and his entourage staying at the Europa, one of the world's most bombed hotels.
The hotel's deputy general manager, Mr Doug Heady, a New Yorker, has catered
for a President before: he worked at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco when
Ronald Reagan stayed there in 1984.
He called it ``a lesson in controlled chaos''.
The hotel was a regular target for the IRA during its years of waging economic
warfare. It was bombed 36 times in 25 years.
Home from home to the world's press throughout the bad times, it was the
Europa's proud boast that it never closed, despite the unrelenting terrorist
attacks.
In 1981, then manager Harper Brown was awarded an OBE for his efforts for
keeping the hotel open. The most recent attack was a 1000lb bomb in May 1993.
It cost an estimated #1.75m to put the damage right.
Despite the present peace, a huge security operation was mounted yesterday.
Almost 3000 members of the RUC and more than 100 American Secret Service agents
flung a tight safety cordon around the President wherever he went.
The agents were given special permission by Chief Constable Sir Hugh Annesley
to carry firearms.
Months of planning went into ``Operation Venice'' with US agents constantly
travelling to Belfast for talks with the RUC.
Tensions were heightened on Wednesday night when there were two bomb alerts in
Belfast, one 200 yards down the road from the Europa.
Army bomb disposal experts were called out and the devices, described as
``crude'' by the RUC, were made safe.
Police divers were sent down drains and sewers anywhere near there the
President was to visit and manhole covers were sealed.
Northern Ireland's International airport was ringed by police hours before Air
Force One landed. Sniffer dogs searched every inch of the airfield and its
terminal. Parts of the building were closed and travellers closely checked out.
RUC marksmen were positioned on rooftops.

SCIENTISTS warned today of widespread drought, floods, and other extreme
weather conditions in the coming century if steps are not taken to counter
global warming.
For the first time experts from 100 countries from the UN Inter-Governmental
Panel on Climatic Change confirmed that humans were responsible for the change
in climate and warned that the average temperature of the planet could increase
by between 1C and 3.5C over the next century.
Drought would increase, but also there would be more floods and other weather
extremes, said Bert Bolin, the conference president, at the end of the
three-day meeting in the Spanish capital, Madrid.
He added: ``There is now a discernible human influence in the climatic change
which before had only been indicated.''
The experts urged governments to bring in tough controls to cut down on the
emission of gases such as carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, and methane.
A move by oil-producing states, led by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to introduce a
footnote that the finding was only preliminary was dropped.

THE increased role for women was described by Isobel Lindsay, of the Campaign
for a Scottish Parliament, as ``the most revolutionary thing that has happened
in Scottish and British politics since women got the vote''.
The result of ``equal representation of men and women'' for a Scottish
Parliament would change Scotland from having one of the lowest levels of women
as elected representatives to one of the highest in Europe.
Such decisive change is possible because it is a new parliament. ``The simple
fact that you are starting off with no `incumbency factor', no bums already on
seats means equality becomes not just theoretically desirable but practically
possible,'' Ms Lindsay said.
For many people active in the constitutional debate gender equality has now
come to symbolise a better form of politics; a principle seen as wildly radical
at first has come to express ``the good society''.
It is, observes writer Tom Nairn, ``an emblem of the kind of country and the
style of nationalism people really want''.
Creating ``the first legislature of modern times to fully acknowledge the
equality of genders'' has, he thinks , stirred something very fundamental to
the Scottish sense of democracy.
Canon Kenyon Wright, convener of the Constitutional Convention, described the
electoral contract, when it was introduced, as ``the most important thing for
the future of Scotland''.
Although some male politicians have complained that this will ruin their
careers, debate has been notably less polarised than around all-women
short-lists in the Labour Party.
From the beginning this has been about much more than numbers. Most believe
that bringing more women in will have consequences for the style of government,
creating a more issue-based and consensual legislature.
The issue came alive in 1989 with the Women's Claim of Right and the idea from
the STUC's women's committee of one man and one woman for every parliamentary
seat.
The relative strength of the women's movement in Scotland and its willingness
to engage with party politics has been critical, particularly the role played
by a network of feminist groups and women from the trade unions.
The means to equality finally arrived at the unique electoral contract which
was signed by George Robertson and Jim Wallace last Thursday. It is not a
statutory agreement but it is workable: Scottish Liberal Democrat Marilyn
McLaren insists it is ``politically binding'' and Isobel Lindsay emphasises
that it will be incorporated into party rules.
Both parties agreed to field equal numbers of women and men candidates for both
winnable and marginal seats, but each will achieve that in different ways.
Labour is likely to use a modified version of all-women shortlists adapted to
paired constituencies, though they will continue to campaign for a statutory
50/50 in the parliament. The Lib Dems will use the additional member ``top up''
to ensure equal numbers, a departure from their policy in England and Wales of
encouragement but non-intervention.
In practice it is likely to deliver close to gender equality, rather than a
perfect 50/50. The SNP and the Tories - though not part of the convention -
also look likely to field more women candidates.

Colombo, Thursday
THE Sri Lankan army had captured more than half of Jaffna town and would bring
the entire rebel stronghold under its control in a ``couple of days'', a
military spokesman said.
Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe said: ``Give us a couple more days, this Jaffna
town will be entirely ours. There's no doubt about that.''
Munasinghe told a news conference in Colombo that the troops had less than half
of the northern citadel of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to take.
``As of Wednesday, we had captured more than half of Jaffna town,'' he added.
He said the military still had to take control of the town centre where the
rebels were resisting.
Munasinghe said rebels trapped inside the town were heard ``screaming for
ammunition, help, and medical help''.
Rebel radio today reported heavy fighting around the suburbs of Jaffna, saying
the Tigers had slowed the army's advance.
Meanwhile, the government this week offered a two-week amnesty to the thousands
of men who have deserted the military in the past five years as the separatist
war intensified.-Reuter.

IT was St Andrew's Day Jim, but not as we know it.
Unlike the Irish, who make a ridiculous song and dance of their national day to
the extent of dying their beer green, the Scots normally keep quiet about their
saint's day.
Yesterday was much the same as usual, except among a certain type of person
(the political/journalistic animal) and a certain place (Edinburgh). While the
rest of the country carried on its usual practice of ignoring the day, the
capital was hit by a wave of something nastier than influenza. Indeed, one good
sneeze yesterday and the entire chattering class would have been infected.
A city officer from the district council read a proclamation from the Mercat
Cross and the only people present were a bevvy of journalists, a sneer of
politicians, and a gaggle of Japanese tourists. Perhaps the city fathers should
have given him a bigger bell, or even better, the organisers might have staged
a damned good hanging.
By then, the likely recipient of this hanging had already stolen the media
thunder by holding the first photo-opportunity and press conference of the day.
The photo was an odd one, stunted in front of the old Royal High School
building. However hostile the intent, it was hard to escape the impression that
using the proposed Parliament building as a backdrop was sending out the wrong
subliminal message.
At the press conference there was the same nervous edge. Does anyone really
believe that Canon Kenyon Wright is somehow a dangerous and sinister figure,
comparable to Stalin? And yet Michael Forsyth went out of his way to point out
that as a former head of CND in Scotland the Canon had been seen off, without
which ``the people of Eastern Europe would still be in chains''.
Over at the Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland the Canon cut a distinctly
less sinister figure, cracking some splendid jokes about the uncomfortable
seating and delivering bits of his speech in French and German. ``You'll be
glad to know I canny manage the other nine languages,'' he assured us.
A friend had told him that he would never get a consensus but if he did succeed
political opponents would sit up and take notice. ``We did. They have,'' he
said. He also had the best metaphor of the day, saying of Michael Forsyth's
proposals: ``This is the State's attempt at a cosmetic smile, to be crudely
painted on for any intelligent Scot to be taken in.''
The standing ovation, when it came, was unstaged, slow to build, and as far
from the stunted adulation of party conferences as it is possible to imagine.
Kenyon Wright spoke afterwards of simultaneous pleasure and embarrassment at
the moment.
Having said that, one of the other churchmen who spoke seemed to have stumbled
into the wrong meeting. Congregational minister the Rev Robert Waters startled
some by announcing: ``In the long-run, I guess Scotland will become an
independent nation once again.''
Meanwhile, the meeting at which he should have announced this was taking place
a few hundred yards away at Edinburgh City Chambers. The SNP launched its own
constitutional vision - actually a coddled together report of various old
policy reports and conference decisions, but who can blame them for not wanting
to miss the show?
You could tell this was the nationalist event. It was held in the European
Room, there wasn't a bit of tartan in sight (even SNP Lord Provost Norman Irons
eschewed the kilt for the day), there was no bagpipes, not even a wee bit of
shortbread. Monsieur Salmond, who was about to jet across to Bruxelles, was in
full Euro-mode, the only giveaway being MacDiarmid's little white rose of
Scotland pinned to his lapel.
By the time the day's constitutional roadshow moved on to Glasgow last night
everyone was getting weary. Michael Forsyth held a press conference to repeat
everything he had said early in the morning. Former Tory MPAlan Clark, doing a
St Andrew's Day colour piece for a Sunday newspaper, was wearing the glazed
look of a man entering the first state of post traumatic stress syndrome, and
Michael Forsyth was explaining once more the close affinity between an
Episcopalian churchman and Joseph Stalin.
As the BBC reported that his Dick Stewart Memorial lecture was already wowing
them at Strathclyde University, the Scottish Secretary was still stuck in a
traffic jam.
The principal, Professor John Arbuthnott, explained that Mr Forsyth was
educated at Arbroath and St Andrews. ``At this time of the year we look to wise
men from the East bearing gifts,'' he explained. Mr Forsyth, having mugged
local authorities of their powers for years, dipped into his poacher's pocket
and committed the offence of political reset.

A FORMER Prime Minister and an Army Chief-of-Staff have been named as members
of the international body being set up to oversee the controversial arms
decommissioning element of the Northern Ireland peace process.
The appointments of one-time Finnish premier Harri Holkeri and General John de
Chastelain, Canadian Army chief, were confirmed by the British and Irish
governments last night.
The nominations were agreed, subject to both men accepting the posts, as part
of the agreement struck in Downing Street late on Tuesday night by Prime
Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart John Bruton in a bid to break the
long-running peace process deadlock.
General de Chastelain, 58, has been Canadian Defence Chief of Staff since 1989,
except for a period of a year from 1993, when he was his country's ambassador
in Washington.
Mr Holkeri, also 58, was Prime Minister of Finland between 1987 and 1991.
The international body is being chaired by former United States Senator George
Mitchell, a senior aide of President Bill Clinton.
The full make-up of the group, and the status of the three appointees, is being
seen as an indication of the crucial importance being attached to the body in
London, Dublin and Washington.
The international body has been set up by the two governments to conduct ``an
independent assessment'' of the arms decommissioning issue.
They hope it will resolve the still-in-contention stipulation by Britain that
the IRA has to move towards decommissioning its weapons ahead of Sinn Fein's
entry into all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
While the body undertakes its work, with a report expected by the middle of
January, preparatory talks are to go on involving the political parties in
Northern Ireland.
That twin-track approach is planned to pave the way to all-inclusive
discussions, possibly by the end of February.
The Prime Minister has made it clear the international body will be advisory.
It will consult ``all relevant parties'' on the arms issue.

THE better-known pleasures of Ireland are on Bill Clinton's schedule today as
he takes time off to sample the Guinness in a typical Dublin pub.
Regulars at Cassidy's Wine and Tea merchants' premises in Camden Street have
been told to stand by their pints late in the afternoon.
American security men called at the 105-year-old city centre bar - recognised
as one of Dublin's finest by those in the know - at least six times before
declaring it suitable for a presidential visit, listed as ``an unscheduled
event'' on the official itinerary.
The pub fits the Clinton bill in several ways as Cassidy was reputedly the name
of the President's mother's family.
If he downs a pint of stout, Mr Clinton will follow the example of Ronald
Reagan, who stopped for a drink in his ancestral home village of Ballyporeen,
County Tipperary, in 1984.
His visit will be the fourth to Ireland by a US head of state.
The most celebrated was by John Kennedy, months before his 1963 assassination.
Richard Nixon was in the country in 1974.
Dublin will get its best chance to see the present US leader when he addresses
a rally outside the city's Trinity College university.
Minutes earlier he will receive the freedom of Dublin, and afterwards a Clinton
walk-about is likely.
More than 3000 Irish police and troops - as well as about 100 American agents -
will be on duty.
An Irish police spokesman said: ``There is no particular menace to President
Clinton here, but every possible security measure is being implemented.''
Mr Clinton's busy schedule includes a call on President Mary Robinson at her
official residence in Dublin's Phoenix Park, talks with Irish Prime Minister
John Bruton, an address to a joint session of the Dail and Senate houses of
parliament and a dinner   hosted by the Irish Government at Dublin Castle.
