THE Herald leader comes down strongly on the side of devolution (December 1).
In a way this is surprising. Like some other institutions in Scotland, The
Herald craves independence for itself yet denies it to the nation it serves.
In recent letters correspondents have deplored the use of the word England in
place of Britain or Scotland and, in part, have put this down to English
arrogance. In this they may be mistaken.
More likely it is simply recognition by outsiders (not just the English) of the
subsidiary position Scotland occupies inside the Union. Just as we get the
Government we deserve, so we are accorded the title that is our due.
To take another example, no-one makes the mistake of calling Ireland England.
The events that took place on St Andrew's Day are unlikely to raise Scotland's
standing in the eyes of the world. A parliament without sovereignty is not
worthy of the name.
On a day when there should be rejoicing, there is indifference; when there
should be optimism and sparkle, there is foreboding; when an inspired people
should be on the march, there is only sheltering in the rain.

Washington
AMERICANS who back making English the official language in the United States
today warned that such legislation was crucial to protect it from the sort of
divisions which have threatened to split Canada.
``Could America fragment like Canada almost did?'' asked Republican Toby Roth,
saying the recent razor-thin vote by French-speaking Quebec not to secede from
the rest of Canada was a ``red warning light'' for Americans.
``Canada offers a great case in point,'' agreed Senator Richard Shelby.
``While it is true their history is different from ours, the fact remains that
accommodating diverse languages only promotes instability, resentment, and a
threat to national sovereignty.''
Roth and Shelby were testifying at a Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
hearing on a Shelby-backed Bill that would require all functions of the federal
Government to be performed in English.
The Bill is one of several moving through Congress making English the sole
language of government.-AP

A DOCTOR was yesterday found guilty by the General Medical Council of
assaulting and raping a secretary in his hotel bedroom after a disco.
The council's professional conduct committee found father of four Dr Michael
Bowles, 43, guilty of committing the offences against 35-year-old ``Miss A'' in
Quebec in June 1990.
The committee heard Dr Bowles, of Wykeham Road, Kenton, Harrow, Middlesex,
lured the woman into a lift to the 14th floor of the Concorde Hotel after
dancing with her and buying her a drink in a basement disco.
French Canadian Miss A, who was flown in from Canada to give evidence, said Dr
Bowles dragged her into his room and tried to force her to have oral sex before
raping her. Two friends of Miss A claimed to have seen her ``crying, bruised,
and upset'' after her ordeal.
Dr Bowles told the three-day hearing that Miss A had been only one of a party
of five or six people who had accepted his invitation to have a post-disco
drink in his room. All the party then left the hotel together and he went to
bed alone.
He said he had tried unsuccessfully to contact these potential witnesses -
particularly a man called Pierre - to back his version of events.
Miss A's two friends had claimed to have seen several injuries on her body and
head but the doctor's counsel, Mr Keiran Coonan QC, cited ``inconsistencies''
which he said indicated the three women's ``script'' had been unravelling.
The committee is now considering the question of serious professional
misconduct.
The committee also found Dr Bowles guilty of professional misconduct and
ordered his name to be erased from the register with immediate effect. He has
28 days to appeal.
Council barrister Rosalind Foster disclosed that Dr Bowles had jumped bail and
returned to this country after being charged with ``sexual assault'' - the
Canadian legal term for rape - on Miss A.
He was re-arrested by Scotland Yard officers in November 1993 and consented to
being extradited to Canada, where he was sentenced to 30 months detention, from
which he was released on March 18 this year.
``Dr Bowles had shown himself as unworthy to be a member of a profession which
requires total propriety in public and private life,'' she said.

ROCK idolatry is a mixture of fantasy, self-deception, escapism and parasitical
devotion. The Heart in Hiding - by two up-and-coming stars, writer/poet Glyn
Maxwell and director Andrea Brooks - is an extraordinary piece that doesn't
just pose awkward questions about the nature of the relationship between idol,
fan, and the public but gets right inside its fevered, narcissistic,
self-destructive head.
Moray Treadwell (he can be seen at Perth in very different guise in the New
Year in the old thriller, Night Must Fall) is a charismatic, crack-voiced, rock
star, Aidan, who one night disappears in the middle of a concert.
Like some twentieth-century ape man, Aidan's music is the kind calculated to
make every adolescent young female feel he's talking just at her. But is he
really? And does he want that anyway?
Pursued into oblivion by three women and a hard-nosed hack out for the story of
the century, Brooks's flashy production with its pounding score by rock
composer Charlie Round-Turner and movement by the great Lynn Seymour, sometimes
comes close to being swamped in its own emotional and musical intensity. Eva
Marie Bryer's febrile speed freak, Sash, for example, appears on the point of
combustion at any moment.
But the play grows in power as Sash, confronted with the physical reality of
her idol finds it too hot to handle and the quartet's battle for Aidan explodes
into open warfare.
Fascinating as an exploration of possession, the motor of money and identity,
Maxwell's free verse, fiery epitaph - like the work of Irving Welsh - captures
a culture and whole way of being with an authenticity that is electric.

A NATION which invented the battered and deep-fried Mars Bar should have little
to say on any aspect of the food/health debate, yet we are worried about beef
and the transmission of the cattle disease BSE into the human population.
Anxiety on matters of this sort is increasingly prevalent and it is a
concomitant of knowledge or, to be more precise, a little knowledge. This does
not mean that it is a dangerous thing; rather that it is insufficient. We all
have a right to as much knowledge on matters which affect us as we can
comfortably absorb. The problem with the information available on BSE and the
human version, CJD, is that it is impenetrable to anyone other than experts,
and even they cannot agree. The general public, therefore, if it wishes to take
any sort of intelligent interest, is obliged to listen to the experts and, on
utterly inadequate information and understanding, to decide whether its
children should eat beefburgers in a fast-food chain, sausages at school, or
even a slice of roast beef for Sunday lunch. This is an intolerable imposition
and it is imposed, moreover, on those who are concerned enough about the diet
of their family to seek a sensible balance of risks and benefits.
Where are we, then, in this tug-of-war debate on one of our staple foods? There
have been worries about BSE passing through the food chain to humankind for
several years and a range of measures to prevent this happening were put in
place, and tightened up recently. These were designed primarily to prevent
certain parts of the animal arriving in the cheaper meat products, such as
beefburgers, pies, and sausages, but there are two significant problems with
the existing regulations. To begin with, they can hardly be adequately targeted
when the cause of BSE/CJD is not known. Some scientists believe that it is a
virus, although if it is, the method of transfer is not known. A major
investigation into the possibility that it is passed from mothers to offspring
is under way but it will not report until some time next year. Another group of
scientists believes that it may be a protein of a new and hitherto unsuspected
type. Here we are in the realms of the unknown and little sensible comment can
be made until a good deal more thinking has been done. The second problem with
the regulations is that they are easily and sometimes frequently flouted.
Careless handling of animal carcasses is nothing new and it persists in
abattoirs up and down the country, increasing the risk of suspect meat products
passing into the national diet.
If it is clear that legislation on the way meat is slaughtered and handled
should be tightened further, it is just as evident that the authorities must
make a more serious effort to reach the truth. A former Government health
adviser, Sir Bernard Tomlinson, backed by a number of highly reputable
scientists, says he will not eat beef pies, beefburgers, or beef liver. Others
call for an inquiry into the animal feedstuffs industry, believed to be
responsible for the initial problem when cows ate infected sheep offal. On the
other side the Health Secretary, Mr Stephen Dorrell, is happy to tell people
who eat beef that they run no known risk of contracting CJD. Both parties to
the argument are correct in the position they take. The scientists are right to
point to discrepancies and to call for further investigation and Mr Dorrell is
correct when he points to the lack of firm evidence of any connection. The
really disturbing people are those like the spokesman of a large meat market
who blamed everything on a plot by vegetarians and a supporter of the meat
industry who said that everyone should be quiet lest an important industry be
damaged. On balance, then, there is no clear evidence of risk but an urgent
need for more investigation. This will not help ordinary people with decisions
to make on their diet, save to say that beef is still a lot better for you than
a battered and deep-fried Mars Bar.

MOST of us have been the anxious relatives of post-surgery patients and have
listened to the professional advice of medical and nursing staff about the
timing of our first visits to our loved ones post-operatively.
Is the advice different in the large London hospital where a complete stranger
- even if a princess - can wander into a ward in the early hours of the morning
to ``work'', as she claims?
Would it not be kinder to send her car for the relatives to take them in to see
their patient next day when it is medically sensible?

THE situation in France continues to deteriorate with no sign of an end to the
wave of strikes and protests over the Government's plans to cut welfare
benefits. If anything, the objections of a widening sector of French life
appear to have hardened in the wake of the Prime Minister's insistence that the
welfare reforms will be pushed through. Mr Juppe is in a difficult position
entirely of his own making. As a responsible Prime Minister he was undoubtedly
bound to do something about the French deficit which owes so much to a
traditionally generous welfare system, and particularly if France wishes to
meet the convergence targets for European monetary union. Yet it is odd that a
seasoned politician should have so misjudged the temper of his own people, many
of whom have a warm appreciation of the benefits of the welfare system and an
antipathy to reducing it which may have been fuelled by a glance across the
Channel.
There is a more potent reason why the French Government is in such a difficult
situation. It owes almost everything to the battle within the right-wing of
French politics for the post of President. The splits within the centre-right
led the candidates to make ever more belligerent promises about what they would
do when in office. Mr Chirac allowed his tongue to run away more than most,
particularly on his tough stance on the economy and also on his plans to cut
unemployment swiftly. The unemployment pledge was patently silly, but the
reform of the welfare system could and should have been introduced with more
consultation and in a graduated manner. Instead an attempt was made to bulldoze
it through, with the entirely predictable results which are visible on the
streets of France this morning. Ironically Mr Chirac has absented himself from
the current row, leaving its conduct to his Prime Minister.
In these circumstances the actions of Labour's Euro-MPs in unanimously backing
the French strikers will not be warmly applauded by Mr Tony Blair. No doubt he
will have his own views on the need to maintain a decent welfare system, but he
will be appalled at his Euro-MPs' decision to back widespread strikes which
stand a fair chance of dislodging Mr Juppe's Government. There is, of course, a
history of disagreement between Mr Blair and the Labour Euro-MPs, compounded by
their majority support for the retention of Clause 4. The prime mover in that
debacle was Mr Alex Falconer, the Euro-MP for Mid-Scotland and Fife, and from
the reports of yesterday's action it appears that Mr Falconer is once more the
instigator. It is good to have independent-minded MPs, particularly those who
put principle above mere party advantage. Mr Falconer is undoubtedly one of
those doughty battlers, but in embarrassing his party leader so sorely, is Mr
Falconer saying that Mr Blair's principles are not good enough? We doubt that
this is the case, but there is a distinct possibility that Labour's Euro-MPs
are somewhat out of step with the party in Britain. If so, this should be
remedied.

UNTIL last Thursday night I had been on the board of directors of Borderline
Theatre Company for some 14 months.
Although I have a family and a more than full-time job as a freelance writer, I
had devoted a great deal of unpaid time to the company, attending meetings and
performances and supporting it through a major Arts Council review.
It was a hugely enjoyable and rewarding experience. This was almost wholly due
to the efforts of an artistic director who was not only committed to high
quality popular drama but also to involving the local community in the theatre
so that old and young people from all walks of life would come to see it as a
resource for them and not for some narrow elite.
John Murtagh's enthusiasm for his profession was infectious. He is a talented
director and actor but, more importantly, he is generous in imparting those
skills to amateur and professional actors alike.
It was with a sense of shock turning to disbelief that I attended the meeting
last Thursday to be presented with three ``options'', the recommendation of the
finance committee being option 2 - ie, John's redundancy (and that of the
theatre manager) with immediate effect.
It quickly became apparent that of the board members present at that meeting
only I, as vice-chair, and Mrs Winnie Goodwin, had no prior knowledge of this
recommendation.
In spite of all our objections, the proposal was overwhelmingly carried. I had
no alternative but to resign immediately, as did Mrs Goodwin.
The revised personnel infrastructure, in the administration's own words, will
consist of a chief executive, an administrator, and  a secretary as well as a
marketing co-ordinator, and an integration co-ordinator.
The only full-time theatre professional now to be employed by a company
receiving substantial public subsidy from the Scottish Arts Council is a
hard-pressed and underpaid drama worker who admirably handles schools, youth,
and special needs work.
In the documents put before the meeting it was stated - chillingly enough -
that the artistic director was ``surplus to requirements''. And this in spite
of the fact that the Arts Council review team found that ``there is a . . .
need to broaden the creative base of the company, thereby releasing more time
for the artistic director to plan and shape the artistic programme''.
Instead, Borderline now proposes to use so-called artistic associates, invited
on an ad hoc basis with no ongoing commitment to the company.
It seems clear to me as an arts practitioner that the one person a funded
theatre cannot do without is a committed and skilful artistic director.
You might question the vision or methods of an individual but the post itself
is indispensable.
Borderline has now become little more than a venue and there are surely more
worthwhile ways of spending many thousands of pounds of public money than on
the administration of such a creatively impoverished company.

THE Maxwell trial came to an unexpected halt yesterday when jurors told the
judge they would feel under pressure if they were sent out to consider their
verdicts before Christmas.
The trial, now in its seventh month, was adjourned until January 3.
Lord Justice Phillips said the last thing he wanted was for them to feel under
pressure and he said their request had shown ``some wisdom''.
He had told the jury he planned to begin summing up next Monday and hoped to
finish at the end of the week, when the jury would be sent to consider their
verdicts, spending the night at a hotel.
If the jurors had not reached verdicts by December 22, they would be allowed
home to celebrate Christmas and would return to resume their deliberations on
December 27, the judge said.
Yesterday, the jury sent a note to the judge saying they were ``feeling
concerned that, after a long and complex trial, they are under pressure
regarding their deliberation process''.
The judge assured the jury that ``at this stage of the trial, and indeed
throughout, you are the most important people. I am not going to send you out
to consider verdicts if you are going to feel under pressure.''
He said he had wanted to send them out as soon as possible while counsels'
final speeches were still fresh in their minds.
However, he said if it was not possible for the jury to feel without pressure
he would sum up after Christmas.
Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, his brother Ian, 39, and former Maxwell executive, Mr
Larry Trachtenberg, 42, deny conspiracy to defraud by misusing shares belonging
to the pension fund.

IN Helen Pridham's article, Budgeting for Old Age, Liz Mitchell of Age Concern
claims that ``private care costs up to #500 per week'' and that ``the Church of
Scotland (residential care homes) provide the lowest- cost care'' (December 2).
This statement is inaccurate because Liz Mitchell is comparing the most
expensive private nursing homes with voluntary residential care homes which
provide a lower level of care. She is not comparing like with like.
Furthermore, her information on relative costs in the different sectors is
wrong. According to the respected consultancy firm Laing and Buisson, the
average fee for a private nursing home place in the UK is about #330 per person
per week and in fact most private nursing homes receive just #295 per person
per week from the DSS or local authority.
By comparison most private residential care homes receive fees of #197 to #227
from the state. Voluntary residential homes, including the Church of Scotland
Homes she mentions, are in fact more expensive than private residential homes
though less expensive than local authority residential homes which average
about #350 per resident per week and can cost up to #440 per week.
These facts can be confirmed by reading the Scottish Office publication,
Residential Homes for Elderly People - their Costs and Quality (HMSO, 1992),
which concluded that private residential homes provide the cheapest care.

CHEESEMAKER Humphrey Errington has won his case against Clydesdale District
Council, which alleged that a #27,000 batch of his Lanark Blue cheese was unfit
for human consumption.
Sheriff John Douglas Allan yesterday turned down a bid by the local authority
to destroy 44 batches of the cheese, a favourite with the royal family. He also
criticised the district council for its methods.
Mr Errington said he was relieved but not surprised that he had won the
year-long case, which has attracted support from Prince Charles. However, he
has run up legal costs of around #120,000 and could still go out of business,
he said.
Mr Errington said he would seek compensation from the council for the batch of
cheese at the centre of the controversy because it was no longer fit for sale.
He added that efforts would be made to recover the full cost of the legal
challenge.
Lawyers acting on his behalf said the council could face a challenge in the
European Court of Justice and may be reported to the local authority ombudsman
for maladministration. The authority already faces a sizeable legal bill, which
could top #100,000.
Mr Errington said: ``It is a huge relief that after 12 months our position has
been vindicated.''
He said the authority had not carried out a full risk assessment of the product
and may not have conducted tests properly.
Mr Errington said there were times when he feared the system would fail him but
he added: ``I felt that, if we persisted, sooner or later it would be
acknowledged we were right.''
He said the public support he received throughout the legal battle had been a
huge boost to morale and added that the judgment had been a victory for the
underdog.
He promised to continue production of the cheese but warned: ``We could still
find when we've squared the legal account that our level of debt is greater
than the business could support.''
His solicitor, Mr Peter Braid, said every legal avenue would be explored to
reclaim Mr Errington's costs.
In his judgment, Sheriff Allan, sitting at Lanark Sheriff Court, said: ``It
does not appear to me upon the evidence that the 44 batches of Lanark Blue
cheese stipulated in the notices of 22 February 1995 failed to comply with food
safety requirements.''
Sheriff Allan said he ``deplored'' the way Mr Errington had been attacked in
Clydesdale's final legal submissions to cast doubts on his integrity.
He added that it would be much more satisfactory if the Environmental Health
Department ``fulfilled their statory functions in a less combative and
confrontational manner''.
The case rested on whether the levels of listeria monocytogenes were high in
the cheese and, if present to any great degree, were they likely to cause
illness. The sheriff said there was no evidence whatsoever to show that the
cheese had made anyone sick.
The sheriff was critical of Dr Syed Ahmed, a consultant in public medicine in
Lanarkshire Health Board. The sheriff said he had little first-hand experience
in dealing with listeria poisoning and was wrong to ``err on the safe side''.
Dr James McLauchline, the UK's top expert on listeria, was attacked by the
sheriff for his ``evasive and defensive responses'' while giving evidence.
On the other hand, the sheriff decided that Dr Richard North, an independent
food safety advisor giving evidence for Mr Errington, was ``open and frank and
did not seek to conceal relevant material''.
The Scottish Agricultural College gave evidence that they discovered very high
levels of listeria in the cheese samples. However, Sheriff Allan said he did
not find the results credible, particularly after he heard the evidence of
French Roquefort cheese expert, Frenchman Jean Devoyod.
The SAC was also criticised for not running strictly controlled tests to make
sure there was no cross contamination when analysing the cheese samples.
In his general conclusions, Sheriff Allan said there was just no evidence to
show the cheese was harmful, particularly after 63,000 portions of Lanark Blue
cheese had been consumed in 1994.
Clydesdale applied for the destruction order under the 1990 Food Safety Act.
When they started action against Mr Errington in December 1994, a EC directive
banning all listeria from food and the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Scotland
regulations 1994 were not in force.
Mr Errington agreed to withdraw his cheese from circulation after a random test
in Edinburgh revealed the cheese found in a delicatessen contained listeria.
The type of listeria found in the batches was serotype 3A and is very rarely
associated with disease. No human case in Scotland had been linked with this
type of listeria between 1967 and 1994.
A complicated legal battle followed which saw the case first before a JP at a
private hearing. That decision was overturned at a judicial review in the Court
of Session because Mr Errington had been denied natural justice. The case
finally went before Sheriff Allan in August.
The council was not available for comment last night.

The case was raised at an options hearing at the court. The hearings, which
have been designed to speed up the course of justice, presented the sheriff
with two options: whether the case could be settled by legal argument or
whether witnesses would need to be heard in court.
Sheriff George Evans decided yesterday, after listening to agents for the three
parties, that the case should proceed to legal argument. The case will now be
heard on February 26.
If it transpires that, legally, one party does not have a case, it could be
dismissed by the sheriff. Alternatively, witnesses could be called on points
established in the legal debate.
Mr Mowetta set up Autofare in 1979 in Havelock Street, Glasgow. By 1986, its
turnover had reached nearly #1m a year. Then in 1992 the premises were sold and
the business divided.
Mr Mowetta continued to trade in Havelock Street as Autofare Garage. In 1993,
he was evicted by one of his former partners and moved to Balmore Industrial
Estate.
The writ alleges the ``defenders negligently advised the pursuer to part with
his control of the business and premises of Autofare in transactions in 1986,
1988, and 1992''.
It further alleges that Mr Mowetta's cheques were dishonoured ``arbitrarily and
without warning''. Mr Mowetta claimed there was a substantial loss of
confidence in him and his business, which resulted in his turnover falling by
more than #800,000.
The Bank of Scotland has said it will ``vigorously defend the action raised by
Mr Mowetta as will the manager's own solicitors''.

Washington
THE Senate has put off its debate on Bosnia until next week, as Senator Bob
Dole seeks to persuade recalcitrant colleagues to support the President. His
deputy, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, has announced his opposition to
deploying American troops, and he must now be induced to accept the position
taken by the party leader.
Lott defeated Dole's candidate for the position of Republican Whip a year ago,
and would presumably succeed Dole if he wins the presidential election.
Relations between the two men are therefore a key to Republican politics over
the next few years and Dole does not want a public split to open now.
Lott is a noted conservative and isolationist. He is probably much closer in
attitude to the confrontational politics practised by Senator Phil Gramm, who
is running against Dole for the Republican nomination and vocally opposes the
Bosnian intervention.
The dispute, therefore, also concerns presidential politics.
Several senators want to use the resolution supporting the intervention to
criticise the President's past policies, and to urge him to arm the Bosnian
Government Army immediately.
Over in the House of Representatives, the Speaker, Newt Gingrich, has yet to
reveal his hand, but it appears that in the end the House will follow the
Senate's lead and support the President.
Former presidents Ford, Carter, and Bush have announced that they support Mr
Clinton, and a long and impressive list of former officials, both Republican
and Democrat, took out a full-page advertisement in the newspapers today making
the point that peace in Bosnia was an important American objective, and
abandoning the Dayton agreement now would do irreparable harm to Nato and to
American leadership.

SENIOR dentists at Glasgow Dental Hospital and School are on the verge of
revolt over what they claim is a dictatorial style of management.
Ill feeling among the 45 consultants and other permament staff is likely to
come to a head tonight at the monthly meeting of the hospital's division of
dentistry.
The hospital became an NHS trust in April, under the chairmanship of Sir James
Armour, retired Vice-Principal of Glasgow University, but dissatisfaction goes
back about a year.
There are about 60 senior staff in the dental division, including 15
consultants employed by the NHS and 30 honorary consultants employed by Glasgow
University. Their complaints include a ``confrontational'' management style and
that clinicians are not being involved sufficiently in policy-making.
One dentist said yesterday: ``There is supposed to be a teamwork approach in
the running of trusts but we are not being brought into the team - we feel we
have no say in the way the hospital is being run.''
Although the board has become aware that grievances are being expressed, a
spokesman for the trust said nothing had been put to it formally. He added:
``The board has an open-door policy and if there are misunderstandings or
legitimate grievances, they are willing to sit down and discuss them.''

Driver out-ran
police at 100mph
MOTORIST Darren Davidson, 25, of Green Road, Kinross, who was chased by police
for 15 miles along twisting roads, was fined #1500 at Perth Sheriff Court
yesterday. He was also banned for three years and ordered to resit his test.
Chasing police reached speeds of more than 100mph but could not gain on
Davidson, who admitted driving dangerously and at grossly excessive speeds.
Bird's ill wind
A RARE American cliff swallow, which should be enjoying hot weather somewhere
between Brazil and Argentina, has been blown off course into the icy British
winter, to the Isles of Scilly.
Positive reaction
THE Magnox-type Wylfa power station on Anglesey, whose operator Nuclear
Electric was fined #250,000 in September for four serious safety breaches in
July 1993, was cleared yesterday by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to
produce electricity until at least 2004.
Prison unrest
RECENT attacks on prison officers at Belfast's Crumlin Road jail were a
deliberate attempt by inmates to have it closed, the Prison Officers
Association claimed yesterday.
Sacking award
OFFSHORE scaffolder Tom Adams, 44, of Barnflat Street, Rutherglen, Glasgow, who

CAPTAIN Scott's Antarctic exploration vessel was sold for #1 yesterday to
Dundee Heritage Trust.
The RRS Discovery was brought back to her home port from London nearly 10 years
ago and was leased for 20 years to the Maritime Trust.
Discovery has become the focal point of Dundee's growing tourism industry.
A replica #1 note from 1900, the year work started on Discovery's construction,
was handed over to the Maritime Trust's chairman, Admiral Sir Julian Oswald.
Sir Julian said the trust had not sold the ship simply to avoid expenditure.
However, he admitted: ``We maintain the Cutty Sark and one or two other ships
at the moment and it is expensive.
``It will be very important for Dundee to attract lots of visitors to come and
see Discovery to help pay the costs.''
Youngsters who were born on the day in April 1986 when Discovery returned to
Dundee presented the replica note, and its modern counterpart, to the admiral.
Dundee Heritage Trust operates the Discovery Point visitor centre beside the
ship's berth on the banks of the Tay.
Mr Jonathan Bryant, chief executive, denied that the purchase of the Discovery
had left the trust with a costly liabilty.
He said: ``We are confident of raising funds for further restoration and for
maintaining the ship as well. Dundee and Discovery are now inseparable.''
Discovery was designed to take Scott on his first journey to the Antarctic and
had a life expectancy of 20 years when she was built.
In the last few years, #1m has been raised for refurbishments and operations
such as hull repairs, remasting, and the removal of fungus from timbers. A
further #200,000 is needed to do work to the hull.
Television personality Loyd Grossman was touring the facility as part of a
campaign to increase public support for museums. He said: ``This is a
particularly exciting project. It shows how important it can be to a city
because museums and exhibitions like this are a focal point and encourage a lot
of local pride.''

THE vast granary on Clydeside, said to be the largest brick-built building in
Europe, has finally closed.
Its owner, Clydeport, is making the last 13 workers redundant.
Meadowside Granary has been used only partially in the last 10 years, either as
office space or for storing some of the European Union's surplus grain or a
small amount of grain for distilling.
There are no immediate plans for redeveloping it. Schemes to make the area a
vast redevelopment site like the London Docklands fell through at the beginning
of the nineties.
To some, the building, said to have been built with 20 million bricks, is an
eyesore. Others regard it as one of the most outstanding structures built in
Scotland this century.

Sarajevo
HEAVY snow snarled Nato's flight plans into Sarajevo today, slowing the arrival
of advance parties to establish bases for the 60,000-strong peace
implementation force (IFOR).
``The winter weather clearly won't help Nato's deployment but it's not taking
anyone by surprise,'' said United Nations spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Chris
Vernon.
``Setting up an operation under adverse weather conditions is always more
difficult than sustaining an existing operation. But these are field troops and
they trained for this. It will just slow things down a bit.''
Meanwhile, a British commanding officer in Bosnia said today that Nato's peace
implementation force would be more determined to quell atrocities than UN
peacekeepers it will soon replace.
Brigadier Richard Dannat compared the two mandates as different as ``chalk and
cheese''.
``Under the present UN mandate, I can do little other than observe, report it,
and actually express my outrage and the outrage of the civilian community of
the world against that kind of behaviour,'' he told reporters in Split, Croatia.
Brig Dannat referred in particular to looting and burning by Bosnian Croat
forces in Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo - central Bosnian towns to be handed to
Bosnian Serbs under a peace agreement initialled in Dayton, Ohio last month.
Only a few hundred Nato soldiers have landed in Bosnia since the Dayton accord,
most of them communications and logistics specialists paving the way for a rush
of troops set to begin about four days after the peace deal is formally signed
in Paris on December 14.
The first US military flight into Tuzla landed today at the airbase where US
Army reconnaissance and liaison teams are setting up the Nato base for northern
Bosnia.
Tuzla will be the seat of the 20,000-strong US IFOR detachment.
About 1400 US troops are in the enabling force, with about 700 soldiers to be
sent to Bosnia and another 700 to be sent to neighbouring Croatia.
British forces began their Nato deployment in Bosnia in a low-key manner today
with four men and a truck.
As the vanguard of an advance party, the two signallers and two logistics
personnel arrived at the United Nations base in the town of Gornji Vakuf
without fanfare.
A foot of snow gave the early arrivals a foretaste of the harsh Bosnian winter
making many of the rugged mountain passes which Nato troops will cross to reach
their camps almost impassable.
The snow could also make it difficult to spot what experts say are millions of
land mines scattered along more than 600 miles of confrontation lines in Bosnia.
As Nato advance troops spread across Bosnia there were fears within the
alliance that humanitarian aid efforts to anchor peace could not keep pace with
the military deployment.
``There is concern that civilian aspects are lagging behind the military . . .
it is not Nato's intention to become a provisional government,'' said one
alliance source.
Nato sources say they want the UN's humanitarian organisations, such as the
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the UN children's fund (Unicef) to
work alongside Nato troops from ``day one''.
``It is not Nato's job to distribute aid and help refugees,'' one diplomat
said. ``It is important to speed up preparation for the civilian side.''
q MORE than 400 Highland Gunners of 19 Regiment, Royal Artillery, will return
to their home base at Colchester today after concluding their tour of duty in
the former Yugoslavia.
They were deployed with their 105mm guns on Mount Igman overlooking Sarajevo in
July. Soon after their arrival in theatre, their guns fired out in anger as
Nato forces demonstrated their resolve to re-open a route for supply convoys
into the beleaguered city.
The regiment recruits largely in the Inverness area, hence their nickname. The
gunners will fly into RAF Lynham in Wiltshire this morning and then be bused to
their home base at Colchester.

<HEADLINE>Professor decides to quit health board over cuts in acute services</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH health board chief has resigned over cuts in acute services.
Professor Richard Olver, vice-chairman of Tayside Health Board for the last
four years, has handed in his resignation stressing that he was left in an
``impossible'' situation.
The professor, a senior paediatrician at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, has
criticised the board for moving resources away from acute services and into
more community-based projects.
Professor Olver also said he found himself ``increasingly at odds'' with the
board's policy and the methods with which they are put into practice.
He was supported by Labour's Scottish health spokesman John McCallion, MP for
Dundee East, who called the resignation ``a measure of the complete bankruptcy
of current Government policy'' in the NHS.
In a statement issued yesterday, Professor Olver explained that, with the
introduction of an internal market to the NHS, there was bound to be a
``tension'' between his role as a member of the purchasing health board and his
work in an acute provider hospital.
He explained: ``Initially, I did not find it difficult to reconcile the two but
latterly, as resources have been diverted away from the acute sector, I have
found my position impossible.''
Professor Olver said he had a problem with the implementation of transferring
resources into primary care, not the policy itself.
He stressed: ``I am not convinced that our decisions to invest very substantial
resources in primary care and community projects are based on sufficiently good
evidence of likely cost effectiveness, or that we have adequate mechanisms for
monitoring whether this investment has been effective in improving health.''
The professor explained that, when he joined the board, he did not realise that
main elements of health board policy are set by the Scottish Office, leaving
the board with limited autonomy.
He added: ``In areas where the board does have the ability to act
independently, I have found myself increasingly at odds with its policies and
the way they are put into practice.
``Since I am bound by collective responsibility and cannot pick and choose
which of the board's policies I support formally, I have decided that
resignation is the only honourable course.''
Mr McAllion said he shared the professor's concerns.
He added: ``I am deeply saddened to hear of Professor Olver's resignation.''
Mr James Macfarlane, chairman of Tayside Health Board, said he ``regretted''
Professor Olver's resignation and added: ``It is not surprising that someone
who has to combine clinical responsibilities in a trust with health board
membership finds occasions when interests appear to conflict.''
The chairman defended the board's policies and described the increasing
emphasis on primary care as a UK move ``which has been agreed throughout the
NHS''.
He said: ``It makes sense to deal with as many health problems as possible as
close to the patients as possible and Tayside Health Board is committed to this.
``The shift to primary and community care aims to avoid unnecessary
hospitalisation and reduce the demands on hospital services, enabling
clinicians to concentrate on specialist care and enhancing both primary and
secondary sectors.''

THE Royal Court's inspired season of classics continues in the West End with
Hysteria by Terry Johnson. Only two years old, one might question the
confidence with which it has been given the status as a ``classic'' but within
moments of the curtain going up there is no mistaking the quality of the
playwright.
Set in Freud's study in Hampstead, near the end of the doctor's life, Johnson
sets out to give us an ``Analysis of an Obsessional Neurosis''. Salvador Dali
comes to tea with Sigmund Freud (a true event) and Jessica, a young woman who
displays most forms of neurosis witnessed in Freud's notebooks, forces her way
into the study.
Abraham Yahuda (Freud's doctor and friend) is an authority figure, attempting
to stop the publication of Moses and Monotheism. As the play becomes
increasingly nightmare-ish it is clear that we are witnessing the analysis of
Freud's own obsession.
Hysteria deservedly won the 1994 Olivier Award for Best Comedy and Johnson
elegantly carries the play through a range of styles - farce, thriller, serious
drama - using wit, slapstick and surrealism. His dialogue is sharp as he weaves
in and out of ideas, teasing the audience with notions of real and unreal,
conscious and subconscious. It requires the excellent direction of Phyllida
Lloyd and the strong cast to carry it off; not to mention the very good set and
lighting design.
Henry Goodman and Tim Potter return as Freud and Dali respectively. Aisling
O'Sullivan joins them as Jessica. It is her shift in moods and direction which
drives the play forward and provides most of the drama. O'Sullivan handles this
superbly; shifting effortlessly from hysterical victim to tormentor, pausing to
be nursemaid and sex object.

YOU report that Strathclyde's director of education will be looking for a job
in April. In the unlikely event of Mr Pignatelli having to sign on at his local
DSS office at least he will be able to write his name.
In a recent article (Dear David: I do wish you could read this) I recounted the
experience of a former Strathclyde pupil left illiterate four-and-a-half years
ago after 11 years of schooling and who has been signing on for these
four-and-a-half years by making his mark.
While failure to make a pupil literate is bad enough, to enter such a pupil, as
is the practice in Strathclyde, for Standard Grade exams at both Foundation and
General level using a scribe (myself in David's case) to read out questions and
write down answers is merely to add insult to an intellectual injury that could
last a lifetime.

MICHAEL JACKSON was taken to a hospital in New York tonight after collapsing on
stage while rehearsing for a TV special, a spokesman for the Emergency Medical
Service said.
Jackson, 37, was suffering from low blood pressure, but was awake and alert
when he was taken from the theatre by ambulance, the spokesman, John Hanchar,
said.
His condition was described as stable by the hospital.
Hanchar said help was summoned by a security guard at the Beacon Theatre, where
Jackson collapsed.
Jackson had been rehearsing for a cable television special, which was scheduled
to be taped on Friday and Saturday for broadcast on Sunday night.
Hancher said initial reports to emergency services indicated that Jackson was
not breathing but he added: ``Paramedics responded and found him to be awake
and alert.''
However, he added that it appeared to be ``a serious condition''-Reuter/Ap.

A CELLO recital that begins with works by Bach and Beethoven can thereafter go
in any direction. But the harmonic compression of Bach's C major cello suite
and the structural tautness of Beethoven's D major cello sonata, Op.102, No.2,
may be thought to demand something even more concentrated to follow.
Last night Ralph Kirshbaum and Roger Vignoles settled for Webern's Drei kleine
Stucke, Op.11, for cello and piano, three pieces so short they hardly exist.
But what does exist in these laconic studies in intensity, as the performance
made plain, is so expressive that a whole world of musical experience is
crammed into a couple of minutes.
Each tiny stroke, each small rustle, each barely perceptible gesture made an
impact far beyond its brief duration.
As an experience, the performance - like all good performances of Webern's
music - was immensely bigger than the sum of its parts.
But having reached so minuscule a goal, the recital had either to stop or
expand. So it expanded into the bleak and skeletal lyricism of Shostakovich's D
minor sonata, in which Vignoles's stalking piano lines darkly shadowed the
warmer flow of Kirshbaum's cello part.
Earlier, things had been more uneven. To the first movement of Bach's solo
suite, Kirshbaum brought somewhat nasal tone and the odd rasp before he and his
rich Montagnana cello settled into the hall's acoustics.
But the performance soon progressed into a strong, free flowing, subtly
coloured exploration of each movement, just as the Beethoven grew into
something greater than its splashy opening might have suggested.

Ten die as bus
plunges into lake
VIENNA: A double-decker bus carrying German tourists toppled into an icy
mountain lake near Salzburg yesterday killing up to 10 people and injuring more
than 30.
The bus, carrying Germans from Landshut, about 40 miles northeast of Munich,
skidded and fell into Lake Wolfgang, apparently while on a narrow two-lane
highway overlooking the lake. Seven bodies were reportedly discovered and three
people were missing, feared dead.
Embassy protests
JAKARTA: East Timorese protesters forced their way into the Russian and Dutch
embassy compounds in central Jakarta today, the 20th anniversary of Indonesia's
military invasion of East Timor. After scaling the embassy walls, there were
about 58 in the Dutch compound, and 40 in the Russian.

Greta Van Susteren said yesterday.
Election violence
CAIRO: Twelve people were killed in clashes in Egypt yesterday during
parliamentary elections marred by reports of widespread fraud by police and
supporters of President Hosni Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party.
Rebels attacked
BUJUMBURA: Heavy fighting rocked Burundi's capital yesterday after the
Tutsi-dominated army mounted what Western diplomats said was their biggest
operation to flush out Hutu rebels in the city.
Grenade deaths
MOSCOW: A man demanding money seized a kindergarten in southern Russia and blew
up two hand grenades, killing three young children and wounding several other
people, including himself. Police said Yuri Kardanov, a resident of
Vladikavkaz, about 930 miles south of Moscow, entered the local kindergarten at
noon on Tuesday brandishing the two grenades.

. . . and the divorce will be final within a few weeks.
Snake jam
NEW DELHI: A cobra crossing a busy road caused a traffic jam several miles long
during morning rush-hour yesterday in India's capital New Delhi. Most Indians
will not harm cobras because it was the mythical pet of Shiva, one of the most
revered Hindu gods.
Tree cheers
NEW YORK: A rousing cheer went up from crowds in central Manhattan as children

AS a fairly well-known member of the Scottish National Party I am often asked
why the SNP is not represented on the Scottish Constitutional Convention. My
answer is always the same. The convention's terms of reference (agenda) were
drawn up by the Labour Party specifically to exclude any debate on the
independence option and this exclusion was unacceptable to the SNP. It is as
simple as that.
Whether the independence option was excluded for fear the logic of the
independence argument would carry the day or because the Labour Party knew that
its exclusion would be unacceptable to the SNP, is immaterial, but it was
undemocratic, to say the least.
Now that the convention has debated and cogitated over the last six years it
has at last hatched a scheme which is very little different from the one the
Labour Party put forward at the 1979 Referendum, and which that same Labour
Party could not implement because of opposition within its own party (see Jim
Callaghan's Memoirs) - even when a clear 77,435 majority of the Scots
electorate had voted for it.
Despite assurances given by Tory Blair and George Robertson there are already
rumblings in the ranks against the new proposals and I very much doubt if they
will ever get off the starting blocks.
While I agree that Scotland has a right to a parliament we have no right to
have a parliament in Scotland in which English opinions and interests are
excluded while we, simultaneously, have a say in England's Parliament at
Westminster.
We can't eat our cake and still have it. It doesn't make sense, and this is the
rock on which the convention's ploy will perish.
For this reason the so-called parliament can be little better than an enhanced
Scottish Grand Committee and will, ultimately, be responsible to Westminster
and only allowed to do what Westminster permits.
English MPs would be daft to grant us anything better, but they would have no
option if we voted for independence.

THE media have given extensive exposure to Michael Forsyth's tartan tax, which
may or may not arrive, depending upon the outcome of the next General Election.
But the media never comment upon the ``tartan tax'' which prevails at present.
Motorists in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland pay about 10p more tax than
motorists in Manchester on each gallon of petrol. Why does Mr Forsyth not do
something about this real imposition?
On George Robertson's proposals for a Scottish parliament it seems that he is
recommending that the English (Westminster) Parliament should stipulate the
taxation powers of his Scottish parliament, by his plus or minus 3p on basic
income tax. What he is doing is ensuring that the English Parliament
effectively controls the new Scottish parliament. He is affirming the
sovereignty of the English Parliament over the Scottish parliament.
Is Mr Forsyth, when objecting to this tax, implying that the English Parliament
should not have sovereignty over the Scottish parliament? Is his statement
about an independent Scotland by 2002 really a hope and not a fear (December 4)?

Tel Aviv
ISRAELI Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's confessed assassin was today ordered to
face trial, set to start on December 19, after a prosecutor read out murder and
conspiracy charges in court.
Gunman Yigal Amir, wearing a grey sweatshirt and a black skullcap, sat on a
bench in a Tel Aviv court, nodding from time to time as he heard the
accusations against him.
Amir is to enter his plea on December 19. Amir has told investigators and a Tel
Aviv magistrate that he killed Rabin. However, his defence lawyer, Mordechai
Ofri, said today he hadn't decided yet how his client would plead.
Even if Amir pleads guilty, there will be a trial, with the three judges
assigned to the case expected to ask the prosecution to present evidence.
If convicted, Amir's mandatory sentence is life in prison. The death penalty in
Israel is reserved for Nazi war criminals and offenders who harm state
security, such as spies.
The defence attorney said he needed more meetings with his client to decide on
a line of defence, but said he would not bring politics into his arguments.
``I see this as a criminal trial, a murder trial that has no political
implications,'' Ofri told reporters after the hearing.
Amir, a fervently religious Jew, has said he killed Rabin to prevent the
implementation of the Israel-PLO autonomy agreements under which Israeli troops
are to withdraw from parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Religious Jews
consider those areas part of the biblical land of Israel.
Amir is also represented by Jonathan Goldberg, an immigrant from the United
States seven years ago who lives in the West Bank settlement of Emanuel.
Goldberg, who has defended Jewish militants in the past, told the Yediot
Ahronot daily newspaper:
``I couldn't believe that he did such a thing. He is sweet, he has a good
heart, and he appears to be a decent human being.''
According to the indictment, Amir decided sometime after the first Israel-PLO
accord, signed in 1993, to kill Rabin. The charge sheet said he recruited his
brother Hagai, 27, and a friend, Dror Adani, to help him.
The court ordered Hagai Amir and Adani to be held until January 7, charged with
conspiracy and weapons violations.

JUST how far out of touch with reality can Ruth Wishart be? Her miserable
attempts to rubbish Daphne Sleigh's views on the Scottish Constitutional
Convention's blueprint for a Scottish assembly were not only ``over the top''
but clearly identified Ruth Wishart as having leanings towards the
``wild-eyed'' left (December 4).
To suggest that if a Scottish assembly were set up it would not use its powers
to add a further burden of tax on the Scottish people is totally unrealistic
and just plain foolish. Over the past 40 or so years, Labour Governments have
consistently raised all forms of taxation. This hardly fills anyone with
confidence that they will not do so on future occasions.
To complain that Daphne Sleigh happens to have facts and figures in respect of
the costs of a Scottish assembly is hardly fair. After all, the Constitutional
Convention seems to be very coy about telling anyone the real costs of anything
they have proposed and at the end of the day the Scottish people - and only the
Scottish people - are going to have to pay the real costs of any taxation
imposed.
The rest of the UK will pay less in tax while a Scottish assembly is free to
impose extra taxes only on Scottish people. That, among many other proposals
made by the convention, is just sheer economic madness.
Loving the Scottish nation is what this debate is all about. Far from being
prophets of doom, the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, as always, is
living in the real world. The emotional fantasies propounded by Ruth Wishart
and her like, if they were ever implemented, would reduce the Scottish nation,
in the longer term, to a second-rate banana republic.
Daphne Sleigh quite rightly pointed out the dangers that lie ahead if the
Scottish assembly ever gets off the ground.

A MAN appeared in private at Greenock Sheriff Court yesterday, charged with the
murder of a man whose body has not been found.
Mr James Cummings, 28, c/o Angus Road, Greenock, made no plea or declaration
and the case was continued for further inquiries.
He is charged with the murder of a 21-year-old Glasgow man, Roderick Campbell,
in a house in Greenock. Further details were not released.
Mr Campbell, of Gladsmuir Road, Hillington, disappeared about two weeks ago. A
week later, police launched an appeal for help saying they were becoming
increasingly concerned about him. Inquiries later switched from Glasgow to
Greenock and an investigation was launched in the Greenock area headed by
Detective Chief Inspector John Sherry.
Mr Cummings was remanded in custody after a brief appearance before Sheriff
George Crozier.

ALMOST one in three financial advisers gives bad advice, according to a report
published today by the Consumers' Association, which says some advice provided
to clients is ``appalling''.
Researchers for the CA's magazine Which? visited 48 advisers, asking for
investment advice in August this year, and concluded that only one in two gave
good advice and that the desire to earn commission influenced some advice more
than the needs of customers.
The researchers found that agents who sold just one company's products were
worst, independent advisers best, and solicitors and accountants ``mixed'' in
the quality of advice they gave.
The magazine report says two researchers consulted 24 advisers each, with
``unambiguous needs'', but almost a third of the advisers recommended an
unsuitable type of investment.
In the worst case, when the best advice was to tell a researcher to leave his
#15,000 redundancy cheque in a risk-free bank or building society savings
account, the adviser recommended he put it all in an investment bond. That
would have earned the adviser almost #800 in commission and left the researcher
with no money to live on.
Which? said that, despite the clear needs of the investigators, advisers
suggested a range of financial products, including life insurance, personal
pensions, Tessas, personal equity plans, and investment bonds.
Ms Kate Scribbins, head of money at Which?, said: ``Too much investment advice
is still poor and some of it is appalling.
``The needs of our Which? investigators were absolutely clear-cut: access to
their money at short notice or within a fairly short period, and therefore
saving without risk.
``Yet some advisers recommended a range of financial products including
unnecessary and unsuitable products such as personal pensions and investment
bonds. In the circumstances, none was superior to a simple, risk-free savings
account. However, these don't earn the adviser commission.''
The Which? report added that the current system of regulating financial
advisers is not working.
One financial adviser, Mr Leonard Mann, proprietor of Atlas Financial
Consultants, of Kilmarnock Road, Shawlands, Glasgow, responded to the report
yesterday.
He said: ``You will always get the salesman mentality selling any product - and
financial services is no exception. But generally we are a very professional
body of people.''

WELCOME to Baldsville. Not a particularly flatter-   ing description of
tonight's audience but, ecologically speaking, we could be on to something very
important here.
As the high-powered stage lights swept the sea of bobbing pates in the crowd,
reflecting beams became magnified to mega dazzle. If focused properly, possibly
into a large prism situated at the back of the hall, this untapped energy
resource could go some way to lessening our dependence on fossil fuels.
And there's surely no better band than Runrig, with their extensive portfolio
of paeans to the elements, and large defoliated following, to investigate this
possibility further.
Saving the world aside, we were given a glimpse of what Runrig could, and
perhaps should, be. Opening with Nothing But the Sun and Day in a Boat from
their new album Mara, we were transported to a land inhabited by Deep Forest
and the likes. Celtic sentimentality meets dance sensibility. Unfortunately
this was swiftly submerged beneath the torpid, middle-stadia wash of sound that
has become their trademark.
It seems churlish to criticise the chaps for not being more interesting than
they are, what with them being the first band to popularise the mix of Gaelic
lyrics with a rockish sound.
Regrettably, in the eight or so years since those heady vanguardist days,
they've progressed, musically, a very short distance. Then again, if they are
selling out decent-sized venues, why should they hunger for more?
If music be the food of love, tonight we dined on potted hough.

<HEADLINE>Accountants face ruin after court's decision Award of #65m shocks industry</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975011884</RECORDNO>

A TOTAL of 150 accountants could face financial ruin after a record #65m
damages award against their firm in the High Court yesterday.
An electronic security company won the damages from accountant BDO Binder
Hamlyn after a judge severely criticised crucial information the firm
volunteered during a takeover bid.
The award, believed to be the biggest in the UK against an accountancy firm,
will send shock waves through the profession.
Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, representing the firm, told Mr Justice May that his
client's insurance cover fell short of the total damages and interest by #34m.
Legal sources said this would mean the 150 partners of BDO Binder Hamlyn were
now liable for the shortfall.
``It could mean ruin for them,'' one source said. ``No-one in the profession
would ever have believed they would be liable in this way.''
Mr Sumption was allowed a hearing to ask for a stay of settlement until an
appeal could be heard.
BDO Binder Hamlyn had valued Britannia Securities Group, target of the takeover
bid, at #105m.
However, the judge found the accountants had been negligent in their audit of
the company, and it was worth only #40m. He awarded bidder ADT the difference
between the audit and true values.
BDO Binder Hamlyn worked for BSG - not ADT, the electronic security company
seeking to buy out the shares.
The judge found the firm had assumed responsibility to ADT at a business
meeting in January 1990, when it gave information about BSG's worth.
Mr Chris Foster, representing ADT, said: ``It was a hard fought victory. I
think it is the biggest single award against accountants in the UK.''
Mr Foster estimated that, with interest payments dating back to the takeover in
1990, the final settlement would be in the region of #95m.
The High Court case hinged on ADT's claim that Mr Martyn Bishop, audit partner
of BDO Binder Hamlyn, assumed responsibility to it at the January 1990 meeting
by restating that the 1989 accounts, which his firm had audited, showed a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of BSG.
ADT claimed the accounts did not give a true picture and that this was caused
by BDO Binder Hamlyn's negligence and it had suffeed loss.
On BDO Binder Hamlyn's information, ADT believed that a premium over the BSG
share price of 25% would lead to an agreed takeover.
ADT director Mr John Jermine told the court that, at the crucial meeting, Mr
Bishop had told him that he had no reason to change his mind over the BSG
accounts, which showed true and fair view of the company's financial position.
Mr Justice May said in his judgment: ``I judged Mr Jermine's oral evidence to
be generally quietly impressive and entirely credible. I was less impressed
with Mr Bishop's credibility.''
He said that if Mr Bishop had qualified his statements on BSG, ADT would have
taken stock.
``I have held that, on January 5, 1990, Mr Bishop stood by the accounts and
thereby assumed responsibility to ADT for the professional competence with
which they had been prepared, and I have held that ADT relied on what Mr Bishop
said.''
q The #65m award will send shockwaves through the accountancy profession.
It could start a rush to abandon hundreds of years of custom, whereby partners
in top accountancy firms are often personally liable for claims against their
companies.
In future, they may seek to ``ring-fence'' themselves, so that the firm would
be liable.
KPMG will split off its business that audits the books of 700 of Britain's
biggest companies next year into a new entity, called KPMG Audit plc.
KPMG senior partner Colin Sharman said: ``Firms often pick up the full cost of
company collapse despite being only partially responsible, and when auditors
themselves have been subject of fraud and deceit.
``It is clear from the size of some of the largest claims that if one were to
succeed, it would wipe out a firm.''

O J SIMPSON has agreed to give his first television interview to CNN, but no
date has been set, network legal analyst Greta Van Susteren said yesterday.
Van Susteren said in a CNN broadcast that she spoke for four hours with the
former American football star last weekend and he was ``adamant'' that there
would be no ground rules for the interview.
``He has promised CNN an interview with no rules whatsoever,'' said Van
Susteren, who provided legal analysis for CNN during Simpson's murder trial.
Simpson was acquitted on October 3 in the June, 1994, knife murders of his
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Shortly after his criminal trial ended, Simpson backed out of his previous
agreement for a broadcast interview because of a pending civil case, set for
April.
Meanwhile, the Daily News in New York reported that Simpson was negotiating a
multi-million-dollar deal to sell a video proclaiming his innocence.
Simpson hopes to sign with a Los Angeles-based company as soon as some
well-known personality agrees to appear with him in the two-hour video entitled

ONE in four homeless young people has tried to commit suicide in the past year
through despair and psychiatric disorders, a mental health professional said.
Mental Health Foundation director June McKerrow said Budget announcements
restricting housing benefit to the under 25s could soon lead to greater numbers
on the streets.
Results of a three-year survey of 161 people, announced yesterday, showed:
q young homeless are twice as likely to suffer a psychiatric disorder;
q more than half had experienced severe parental neglect or abuse in childhood;
q parents of young homeless people were three times more likely to have had
psychiatric treatment themselves;
q only 15% of those with a psychiatric disorder received help.
Full details of the survey - Off to a Bad Start - are due to be published early
next year.
Ms McKerrow said: ``Our research clearly shows that young homeless people are
vulnerable to mental health problems and some are so desperate about their
futures that suicide seems the only answer.''

<HEADLINE>How Scotland would gain from a tartan tax-break</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975011888</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THANKS to the indefatigable efforts of Michael Forsyth and his colleagues we
are hearing a great deal about the so-called ``tartan tax''. If we are to
believe the Unionist doomsayers, the mere possibility of a Scottish Parliament
having the power to vary personal taxation rates would lead to a flight of
industry and commerce and the subsequent ruination of the Scottish economy.
Yet, curiously, we hear much less about the possibility that a Scottish
parliament would use its powers to lower rather than to raise taxation levels -
a tartan tax-break rather than a tartan tax. In doing so Scotland could easily
increase its total tax revenue.
Even if the power to lower taxes were restricted to the modest 3p in the #1
proposed by the Scottish Constitutional Convention, the resultant tax-break for
high earners (#100,000pa and over) would be several thousand pounds a year. One
can imagine that every financial adviser south of the Border would be urging
his clients to establish Scottish residency for tax purposes. Given that most
of the English upper classes seem able to claim a Scottish granny or auntie or
second-cousin-once-removed, a considerable number will find this relatively
simple.
Since such individuals command a disproportionate share of total taxable income
their reassignment to a Scottish tax residency will have an effect quite
disproportionate to their actual numbers. Scotland's notional tax base will
soar, possibly to double current levels. So, paradoxically, lowering the tax
rate could lead to almost doubling the Scottish parliament's income tax
revenues.
There is, as always, a catch. In this case, it is that the above scenario only
works if the Scottish parliament collects its own tax revenues. The Scottish
Constitutional Convention proposed originally that their Scottish parliament do
precisely that. Only in the last stages was this option dumped in favour of a
block grant from Westminster. George Robertson presented this change at the
time as a ``technical'' modification of no real political significance. On the
contrary, it changes the whole ball game.
Imagine what would happen if a Robertson-model Scottish parliament attempted to
lower income tax by 3p in the #1. The notional Scottish tax-base would expand
as before but, instead of Scotland gaining extra revenue, the full cost to the
Whitehall Treasury of the loss of their UK revenue would be deducted presumably
from the Scottish parliament's block grant. The Scots would end up subsidising
tax-avoidance schemes for wealthy Englishmen, while suffering huge reductions
in the income available for essential services.
By dropping the requirement that Scottish taxes be collected in Scotland, the
convention partners have shot themselves in the foot. The compelling logic for
a Scottish parliament, of whatever political complexion, is to lower rather
than to raise tax rates. Yet this they cannot do because the tax-gathering
machinery rests with Westminster.
This has other consequences beyond the missed opportunities for raiding the
English tax base. We are told that higher taxes in a self-governing Scotland
will lead to a loss of jobs. One recent newspaper poll came up with the figure
of 9000 jobs to go in the event of a 3p increase in income tax.
Conservative businessmen assure us that the reasons for such an outflow have no
basis in anti-Scottish bigotry or in any distaste for democracy. They are
simply a matter of business logic. If this is so, and who am I to challenge
such sober-minded calculation, then the same economic imperative presumably
operates in the opposite direction. English and multinational firms, finding
that income tax was 3p less in Scotland, would come flocking over the Border.
And, since there are 10 times as many of them as of us, the effects would be 10
times as great.
Thus, if the Unionists calculate that a 3p rise in Scottish income tax will
lead to 9000 jobs lost then, by the same token, a 3p reduction will mean 90,000
jobs gained.
The signatories of the Convention's Claim of Right asserted the sovereignty of
the Scottish people over that of the Westminster Parliament. Yet the plans they
have now produced foresee the legitimacy of the Scottish parliament as being
rooted in an Act of the Westminster Parliament rather than in the sovereign
power of the Scottish people. Probably this about-face has been due to the fact
that when the concept of popular sovereignty was considered in depth the only
logical outcome was seen to be independence - the project of their hated rivals
in the SNP.
Antipathy towards SNP policies and personalities is something quite separate
from the merits of independence. If the Scottish business community could only
have the confidence to see the opportunities available in an independent
Scotland, then they might even aspire to lead it.
For any clear-sighted entrepreneur the economic potential that can be unleashed
by independence is staggering. The tartan tax-break paradox means that lower
taxes mean higher revenues, not just for income tax but also for corporation
tax and excise duties. With all this going for it an independent Scotland,
oil-rich and debt-free, could rapidly regain its place among the wealthiest
nations on the planet.

DELEGATES attending a special weekend conference of Scotland's biggest
teachers' union will be asked to back a call for a national one-day strike
followed by a rolling programme of industrial action in a campaign against
underfunding in education.
Strike action will, however, be opposed by the leadership of the Educational
Institute of Scotland, which wants the campaign to focus on areas such as
reducing class sizes, pressing central and local government for greater
investment in education, involving parents and students, and holding a national
demonstration against cuts.
The union believes that underfunding is the single biggest issue facing
schools, colleges, and universities, and underpins many of the problems in the
sector.
Another motion re-affirms the union's opposition to compulsory redundancies at
further-education colleges. Strike ballots will be held in colleges which make
lecturers redundant against their wishes.
The meeting was requisitioned by more than 5000 EIS members who signed a
petition calling for a special conference on underfunding.
EIS concerns are also reflected in the union's response, published today, to
the Government's Higher Still reform of upper secondary schooling.
It said the programme could not be implemented until adequate resources were
made available. The Government has put #4m into developing courses for fifth
and sixth-year pupils but the union said supplementary funding from local
authorities had been necessary to ensure that principal teachers could take
part in the consultation.
It also said that Budget statements from Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
made it clear that education spending would be so tight that the minimum
requirements of Higher Still could not be met.
Underfunding and the many demands being made on schools meant that the 1998
deadline for implementing the programme - extended after the Government was
told that the original timescale was too tight - could not be met, it said.
Confirming that the EIS would continue its boycott of Higher Still as part of a
wider workload campaign, the union's general secretary, Mr Ronnie Smith, said:
``If adequate funds are not made available, it would be quite irresponsible for
the EIS to advise its members to take part in what would be a botched job,
likely to do irreparable harm to a generation of pupils and students.''

I was disgusted at the David Bowie concert at the SECC (November 30). On
arrival we were informed that Morrisey was ill and I can only think that this
was due to him having a preview of the show as it was dire. Flashing lights,
incoherent ramblings, and weird electronics did nothing for me. David Bowie
should retire perhaps. I should have taken the refund and bought tickets for
Rod Stewart.

Paris
ON the 13th day of France's crippling public-sector strikes, unions today
widened their offensive against government plans to overhaul the debt-ridden
welfare system.
Government and union leaders dug in their heels in a test of strength that
appeared to have no end in sight.
With teachers, hospital staff, and airline workers poised to join the strikes
tomorrow, union leaders called for more stoppages in both the public and
private sectors as well as nationwide demonstrations.
About 700,000 people demonstrated in cities around France yesterday in protests
that at times turned violent. Strikers clashed with police in Paris and wounded
21 officers in Nantes in the western region of Brittany.
The Force Ouvriere union, a key player in the two-week wave of stoppages,
called for more walkouts tomorrow in both the public and private sectors and
for marches across the entire country.
Workers' Force accused the Prime Minister of rejecting its demand for full
negotiation on welfare reform.
``It is necessary to continue the struggle,'' said Louis Viannet, communist
head of the CGT General Confederation of Workers, the largest union.
The CGT issued a statement calling for strikes and demonstrations in all
regions in both the public and private sectors following the call from the
non-partisan Force Ouvriere.
``The CGT congress urges that December 7 be a new and powerful date for united
action by all professions, in making strikes and demonstrations more widespread
across the country,'' the statement said.
Here is a summary of the main disruption caused yesterday, or expected later in
the week:
Transport - No rail or Paris public transport services. Bus and metro services
restricted in main provincial cities. Stoppages to spread to Marseille, Nantes
and Lille today.
A drop in temperatures worsened misery for commuters, but morning traffic jams
were less severe than earlier this week.
Limited Eurostar trains between Paris, London, and Brussels.
Marseille, Nantes, Dunkerque, and Saint Malo dockers on strike. Ferry services
from Calais, Dunkerque, and Dieppe disrupted.
Air France and Air Intercabin crews expected to go on 24-hour strike tomorrow.
Air controllers in regional centres are on strike, causing up to 90-minute
delays on most flights out of Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports. Ground
navigation personnel expected to stop work tomorrow.
Government offices - Widespread stoppages by local authority workers. Bank of
France expected to strike tomorrow and on Friday.
About 3.7% of civil servants, 58,000 workers, are on strike, with the economic
and finance sectors hardest hit.
Public sector: Postal officials say 77 of 135 sorting centres have been closed
and 43 disrupted. Several post offices are closed and 17% of staff are on
strike. Air mail sorting centres at Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports are
also hit.
France Telecom said 46% of its employees were on strike.
Sixty-three hospitals are operating at minimal levels and 40 social security
processing centres have joined the strike.
Meanwhile the Government, under world fire over its nuclear weapons tests,
today said it would complete the bitterly disputed South Pacific experiments
before the end of February, three months ahead of schedule.

PRESIDENT Clinton has vetoed Congress's proposals for balancing the budget over
the next seven years. He said that he would offer his own budget tomorrow.
The Bill was a vast measure, completed over several months' work, revising
every aspect of the American Government, cutting many programmes and
eliminating others entirely. It also cut taxes by $240bn in the seven years.
Most of the money for the tax cut would come from a reduction of $270bn in the
planned expansion of Medicare, the health insurance plan for retired people,
and from Medicaid, the health insurance plan for the poor and disabled. It is
these reductions that are most unpopular and which Mr Clinton has denounced
most strongly.
He agrees, however, that the expansion of Medicare and Medicaid must be slowed.
At the moment they increase by about 10% a year, a rate that cannot be
sustained indefinitely.Both he and the Congress would raise premiums paid by
Medicare recipients, the president to $77 a month in 2000 and the Congress to
$88.90.
Mr Clinton also rejects many of the proposed cuts, particularly cuts in
education, welfare, and environmental protection. He considers them much too
draconian. He restores some $475bn over the seven years, partly by offering a
smaller tax cut, partly by using a different calculation of the rate the
economy might be expected to grow.
This is a crucial question: if the President's more optimistic figures are
believed, it will be fairly easy to balance the budget. Congress prefers to
believe that the economy will grow more slowly, thus raising government revenue
more slowly than the President expects - and making deeper cuts necessary to
balance the budget by 2002.

SERIAL killer Rosemary West is to go ahead with an appeal against her
conviction on 10 murder charges, her solicitor said yesterday.
Her grounds for appeal would be considered, initially by a single judge, within
the next couple of months, Mr Leo Goatley said. The judge would decide whether
the matter should be heard by a fully constituted court.
``Essentially, our grounds of appeal are that we want to have another look at
the similar fact evidence which was used in the trial, and its admissibility,''
Mr Goatley said. ``We also want to review the arguments on severance which were
put before the trial judge, and we are also concerned about payments to
witnesses and the effect that had on their evidence.''
Mr Goatley said West, 42, was waking up in Durham Prison each morning ``with
feelings of frustration and anger''.
He went on: ``I think that is entirely natural and I think it says a lot about
her innocence.''

IRISH Prime Minister John Bruton yesterday urged all political parties to
co-operate with an international body being established to oversee the
decommissioning of arms in Northern Ireland.
He also called on politicians to apply themselves to preparatory discussions
for all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
Mr Bruton made his double plea in the Dail, the Dublin Parliament, in the face
of rejections spelled out this week by Ulster's two main unionist parties in
response to talks invitations from Ireland's Foreign Minister Dick Spring.
The Irish premier declared: ``We have agreed that we will consider
constructively any practical suggestions that could help to bring all parties
into negotiations.
``Everyone concerned - particularly the parties in Northern Ireland - have
responsibilities to build on this opportunity for substantial forward
movement.''
Mr Bruton indicated he felt the reply from Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble
``left room for exploratory dialogue''.
Mr Trimble had ruled out talks on Northern Ireland with any ``foreign
government''.
Mr Bruton confirmed he would be having bilateral talks on the peace process
with Prime Minister John Major next week during a European heads of government
meeting in Madrid.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring are to review Ulster peace process developments at a meeting in London
on Friday.
They will consider the response of political parties to invitations to
preliminary discussions on all-party talks, issued by their two Governments
earlier this week.
The invitations followed last week's Downing Street agreement on ways of
advancing the peace process.
Both of Ulster's Unionist parties have turned down the invitations.
Nevertheless, Mr Spring and Sir Patrick will press on with a consideration of
the structure for talks and the prospects for following up last week's visit to
Ireland by United States President Bill Clinton.

FORMER Take That star Robbie Williams yesterday began legal action in the High
Court in a bid to break away from his record company.
He is claiming his contract stops him pursuing a solo career because the
company have exclusive call on his talents and this is an unreasonable
restraint on trade.
The full trial, to be heard before Mr Justice Jacob on February 26 next year,
echoes the long legal battle fought by George Michael against his record
company, Sony Records.
Williams's record company, BMG Records, said his contract with them allows him
to pursue his career and they would be seeking an injunction to stop him going
elsewhere.
Mr Ian Mill, representing BMG, said if Williams wanted to pursue a solo career
how could the company's contract with him - even if it meant he must stay with
them - be restrictive.

IT is more than 1000 times the size of Earth and almost half a billion miles
away. What feeble sunlight reaches it falls into layer upon layer of gaseous
cloud because it has no solid surface. To top it all, its atmosphere and
general environment would prove fatal to any known living creature.
So why spend a billion pounds and more than six years mission time sending a
probe to one of the most inhospitable places imaginable?
The Americans are at fault. They spent the cash and they put the Galileo probe
into orbit about Jupiter. And, of course, let us not forget that none of this
space nonsense would have amounted to anything if they hadn't taken the humph
at the Soviets launching the first satellite - about the size of a decent
Christmas pudding - into space. Every sensible person knows that all this money
poured down the cosmic plughole could have been much more intelligently spent
here on Earth.
This kind of thinking misses the spot, like a diver hitting the edge of the
swimming pool. It is, like most things that are wrong with the modern world,
again the fault of America. Had the Conquistadors not returned from Central and
South America with ships groaning under the weight of their gold cargoes
perhaps we would not have developed the mind set which expects big bucks from
any and every venture into the unknown.
The point of science is to explore the unknown, to erase those dragons of
ignorance from the mind's great map of what goes on around and within us and
replace them with knowledge.
There is, of course, a well-known spiral here. The more we know, the clearer
our vision of what we call reality, the more dragons we perceive.
This is why we have gone to Jupiter with Galileo. In the 1970s the Voyager
probes streaked past this vast world, bigger than all the other planets of our
solar system scrunched together. Images came back which left astronomers' jaws
swinging in the wind. They discovered that Jupiter has a ring system like
Saturn. They received close-up pictures of atmospheric super-storms which would
swallow the Earth with hardly a burp. They encountered a stunning
electromagnetic field.
They also found its moons were wild, weird and utterly unexpected.
Io, the innermost moon, is the most volcanic place known to humankind. It is so
close to Jupiter that it spins round it in less than two days. By comparison
our moon takes a fortnight to orbit Earth. The tides on Io scarcely compare
with the ones down here, where changes in sea level are measured in feet. The
pull of Jupiter on Io stretches the surface, the crust, out by half a dozen
miles at its equator. This is a spectacular laboratory for those who want to
understand better the way such forces work, the way vulcanism can operate at
these scales, where individual eruptions can be seen from the Hubble telescope
orbiting just above our heads.
Farther out from the colossal planet are Europa and Callisto. The former is a
great ice ball which some suspect to contain an ocean tens of miles deep and
warmed by the same tidal forces which disrupt Io so severely. The interesting
point here is that if such an ocean exists, does it contain life? Not all life
on our world needs sunlight to survive. In fact, there are bizarre microbial
lifeforms which grow around the mouths of underwater volcanoes on the floors of
our own oceans. Many scientists who once pinned their hopes on Mars as an abode
for extraterrestrial life now look to the oceans of Europa instead. How life
started on Earth is a mystery. Will we find some indicators there?
Clues to the secrets of beginnings are scattered about the whole Jovian system.
Callisto, another moon - bigger than the planet Mercury - and Ganymede, farther
out still, look like repositories of answers to the enigmas which still veil
the processes which were at work during the birth of our solar system.
But the vast shrouded giant itself will surrender some of its own secrets when
Galileo's descent package enters the upper layers of the atmosphere today. This
will send back information on those incredible weather systems, the composition
of the gases at various depths and, hopefully, give us some inkling of what
lies way down in the ebb and flow of the liquid metallic hydrogen swirling in
the hot heart of this strange world.
So, let's return to the original question. Why visit Jupiter?
Well, why any scientific experiment? It doesn't matter whether they're
researching the moons of Jupiter or the reproduction techniques of viruses.
What scientists do is prospect the landscape for us and give us information
with which we can build new roads to a slightly improved tomorrow.

WHAT does Auld Reekie have in common with the Taj Mahal, the Grand Canyon and
Mont St Michel? Not much, except that from today two large chunks of the
Scottish capital join the others in qualifying as a World Heritage Site.
In ancient times there were reckoned to be seven wonders of the world. Today
there are 440, according to the scheme's organisers, the World Heritage
Secretariat, a branch of the controversial Paris-based United Nations cultural
agency, Unesco. The list, which takes in both natural and cultural sites, was
begun in 1972 and continues to grow by about 30 a year. To qualify, sites and
monuments must be ``considered to be of such exceptional interest and of such
universal value that protecting them is a concern of all mankind''.
There was general rejoicing yesterday in ``the Athens of the North'', among
planners and conservation bodies at news of Edinburgh's accolade, despite some
confusion as to precisely how the city stood to benefit.
Britain now boasts 14 World Heritage Sites, though the only other one in
Scotland is St Kilda, the group of islands to the west of the Hebrides,
deserted in the 1930s when its dwindling population was reduced to the verge of
starvation. Today its only inhabitants are members of the Royal Artillery.
Yesterday a spokesman for St Kilda's owners, the National Trust for Scotland,
said he couldn't think of any way the archipelago had benefited from its
illustrious designation, beyond the kudos of belonging to such a list of elites.
Like Unesco itself, the World Heritage Secretariat faces a constant funding
crisis and the tiny World Heritage Fund, with barely #2m a year to distribute,
gives grants almost exclusively to the poorest among its 143 member states.
Mr Graham Duncan, the City of Edinburgh Council's director of planning, said
yesterday: ``Though there is no immediate reward, we hope this designation will
give us extra leverage in attracting public funding, including European
funding. It puts us into the top league of cities in terms of conservation.''
The extension of traffic-calming schemes, such as the one recently completed in
the Royal Mile, will be a top priority.
Mr Terrence Levinthal, secretary of the Cockburn Association, Edinburgh's
leading conservation body, said he hoped the award would help raise the
standard of both conservation work and new-build projects: ``We hope that this
designation means that the `just about good enough' approach to planning and
conservation we've sometimes seen here will be deemed no longer acceptable.
We'd hope it will add greater conviction to the imperative of ensuring that
central Edinburgh will be only enhanced and not diminished by future
development. We'd like to see a more holistic approach in considering the
future of these areas.''
Edinburgh will be the biggest urban site in Europe to land the designation.
What impressed the selectors was the juxtaposition of the old city, dominated
by its medieval fortress, and the neo-classical New Town. Both the New Town and
a large part of the Old Town are included in the citation. ``The city has
exerted far-reaching influence over European urban planning,'' said a Unesco
spokeswoman yesterday. The only other British city on the list is Bath.
The decision to invite Edinburgh to join this exclusive club is being announced
today at a four-day meeting of the World Heritage Committee in Berlin. It marks
the end of a 10-year campaign by Historic Scotland and the city council. In
theory, all sites which satisfy the strict criteria laid down and are deemed to
be ``places of equal splendour'' qualify to join the list. In practice, the
process is lengthy and bureaucratic, not to mention rife with political
manoeuvring. For example, the French have 21 designated sites, compared with
Britain's 14 and there are more than three times the number of cultural sites,
compared with natural ones.
``Lists like this are meant to be objective but when you know the process, you
realise they are nothing like objective. In practice, it is the opinions of the
great and the good at any one moment which decide whether an application is
successful,'' says Mr Jim Arnold, manager of New Lanark, Robert Owen's model
industrial town at the Falls of Clyde, which applied to become a World Heritage
Site in 1986 and is still awaiting the outcome.
Although Iron Bridge Gorge in England is a designated site, it is one of around
only 10 industrial sites in the world to have got through the selection
process. Britain can nominate just one site a year and, although the New Lanark
application is still on the shortlist, it is unlikely to get any further until
the International Council of Monuments and Sites completes an assessment of
industrial sites throughout the world.
Probably the most valuable aspect of World Heritage Site designation is the
protection it can offer. At present 17 places, including the historic city of
Dubrovnik and the Florida Everglades, are on a special list of sites in danger.
Earlier this year Unesco intervened dramatically to prevent the Egyptian
government from building a new road close to the Pyramids, the only one of the
seven wonders of the ancient world to have survived.
Ironically, today New Lanark probably needs the sort of protection World
Heritage status can bring more urgently than Edinburgh. The conservation trust
which runs New Lanark is currently locked in a dispute with local landowners,
who have opposed a proposal to extend the area covered by the trust.

Nicholas Powell reports from Paris how the embattled French Prime Minister has
few allies, and his own political survival is now at stake
PRIME Minister Alain Juppe has become the loneliest politician in France.
When he made his long-awaited speech to justify his deeply unpopular welfare
reforms in the National Assembly on Tuesday, up to a million workers were
protesting in the streets of French towns. Yet Mr Juppe, who later repeated his
arguments on television, has hardly budged in the face of protest.
He insists his reforms are vital for the survival and the future health of
France's welfare system.
Civil Service pension schemes are going to be the subject of a government White
Paper. But there will be no discussion with unions and no change to the other
reforms. There is, Mr Juppe might have said, no alternative.
The attitude of unions hardened yesterday. With more demonstrations planned
today and no end in sight for the strikes which have been playing havoc with
France's economy and the lives of her citizens for nearly a fortnight, the
Prime Minister is completely entrenched.
His survival and that of his Government is pinned on pushing through the
reforms to the welfare system and the railways. Not only the unions, but the
Socialist opposition, his enemies on the right, and President Chirac himself,
are all watching his slightest move.
The National Assembly debate gave the Socialists, virtually silent since the
beginning of the strikes, the opportunity to rise to the attack. And although
Mr Juppe, thanks to the large right-wing parliamentary majority, was in no
danger of being outvoted, many conservative politicians in the corridors of the
house were critical of the clumsiness, to say the least, with which the reforms
have been imposed on the country.
Part of Mr Juppe's isolation is due to the very mechanisms of the Fifth
Republic created by General de Gaulle in 1958. The Prime Minister is the front
man responsible for implementing presidential policy, who acts as a shield, and
a dispensable shield, for the man in the Elysee Palace.
Whatever behind-the-scenes advice President Chirac may have given Mr Juppe over
recent days, his official and visible support has been sparse.
Mr Chirac retreated from the political fight, spending three days last weekend
at a conference of French-speaking nations in Africa, where he reiterated his
support for the Government's reforms.
He also pointed out that he, as President, had time. While the presidential
mandate runs for another six years, Mr Juppe's job could end tomorrow. If the
situation worsens, sacking the Prime Minister may be the only solution for the
President to save face and retain his authority.
Mr Juppe's political loneliness is also partly self-imposed. His attitude to
the strikes has been to refrain from comment in the press and, until two days
ago, on television. Already highly unpopular on account of indecisive policies
during his first months of office and because of a property scandal, his
standing in the polls is now rock bottom, with barely 30% of people satisfied
with his performance.
Mr Juppe's political enemies, such as his old rival Philippe Seguin, the
Gaullist president of the National Assembly, and, further to the right,
Philippe de Villiers, have also left the Prime Minister to stew in his own
juice by remaining uncharacteristically silent, or obliquely critical, since
the beginning of the strikes.
Former Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, meanwhile, spoke out today to decry
the reforms as ill-prepared and badly presented.
Mr Juppe's stubborn adherence to his reform programme is founded on a solid
belief that France desperately needs to cut back on its public spending.
Juppe's career now depends on a change in public opinion, still mainly
favourable to the strikers, and a quick end to the unrest so that France's
economy, and especially the franc, emerge relatively undamaged.
After Mr Juppe's performances in the National Assembly and on television,
nothing seems less sure. The next week or so will make or break the Prime
Minister.

The formation of a Scottish arm to RUPA, the Rugby Union Players' Association,
came one step nearer as meetings were held between interested parties in
Edinburgh yesterday, with Gavin Hastings and Keith Robertson two of a potential
three initial representatives for the players in Scotland. Craig Chalmers is
believed to be the third. The SRU are set to give the organisation their full
blessing.
Richard Moon, the Welshman whose idea sparked the formation of the Britain-wide
organisation, held talks with Robertson and Hastings after his arrival in the
capital. I understand that Hastings wanted clarification of the status of any
future role should he become involved.
Moon then held a further meeting with Rob Wainwright, the Scotland captain, and
Craig Chalmers. From there, Robertson and Moon went to Murrayfield to meet Jim
Telfer and Fred McLeod.
``A body like this will be good for all the players in the country,'' said
Craig Chalmers yesterday. ``It will give them representation, and Richard Moon
has had a very positive reaction from both the RFU and the WRU, who have given
him their full backing. We have to have a set-up that protects some of the
younger players, to give them advice. Richard Moon has spoken with the
equivalent football and cricket organisations, and there has been a great deal
of fact finding.''
Telfer expressed his good wishes about the project. ``Both Fred and I told the
players that we were delighted that they had come to us,'' he said. ``It was an
excellent meeting, and very positive, and that is what we will be telling the
committee. We are very glad that they have not gone behind our backs.''
q.I UNDERSTAND that the endless targeting of Scottish players by English clubs
carries on unabated. Latest in a long line is Melrose winger Craig Joiner, who
has been approached by both Newcastle and Wasps. Joiner, a university student
in Edinburgh, could conceivably travel to Newcastle three or more times a week
without affecting his studies too seriously.
``All of our best players are being approached by English clubs,''says players'
agent Ian Mclauchlan. ``Some don't want to move, but if there's enough money
then they will go, as others have in the past. I expect a few more will be
looking for advice.''
English clubs have been phoning other players, among them Graham Shiel, and
many Scottish players have travelled to England to see the facilities at the
bigger clubs.
q.MURRAY Clayton, the former Whitecraigs referee, was across grading the New
Zealand man in charge of the Ireland v Fiji game. It was one heck of a night
after, and in the morning a suitably restrained Neil Francis was walking
guiltily through the corridors of the team hotel.
It transpires that Francis was rooming with Simon Geoghegan, who is an
inveterate snorer. Unable to stop the flying winger from snoring, Francis had
woken up constantly through the night. At last, he saw a glass of water at
Simon's bedside and downed it thirstily.
As he lay there some hours afterwards, Francis was first aware of a punching
sensation in his ribs, and a yelling noise in his ear. He was being punched, by
his room mate indeed. And the yelling noise was: ``What the hell have you done
with my contact lenses?''
q.I RECKON Cartha Queens Park do as much to promote rugby in Glasgow as anyone
else, and I also hear that Grangemouth, in the centre of the country, play the
same role there. Twenty schools have been targeted by their own rugby
development officer Corey Kennett, a New Zealander who can play too - last week
the 24-year-old scored a hat trick of tries against Kilmarnock.
It's yet another concept that has been ``sportsmatched'' by the Sports Council,
doubling the funds available to promote sport. Russell and Aitken, the lawyers,
are the main sponsors of the SRU accredited course, and Midland Bluebird are to
bus the kids to the rugby ground.
q.JIM Telfer was a busy man yesterday. What with all the meetings, and then
being interviewed by six little lads from Balerno school. They were going to
give all their quotes to Brian Meek.

SOPHISTICATED romantic comedy, once a Hollywood staple, is on offer in Rob
Reiner's super glossy, highly entertaining, but in the end shallow look at what
happens when the man in the White House falls in love, The American President.
The film is at its best when it shows how the President's thinking is done for
him, how there is always an aide at his elbow to prompt him with a name so that
the person encountered is properly flattered, and how his diary is manipulated
by his advisers. It is also interesting when it reveals the ruthless politician
behind the man-of-the-people exterior, but unfortunately at its least
convincing when it gets down to the romantic stuff.
Michael Douglas, playing a good guy for a change, or as good a guy as any
politician who gets to be President of the United States is likely to be, is
Andrew Shepherd, a widower with a terribly understanding teenage daughter. She
actively encourages Daddy to get laid, which is nice for him. Although the film
does not attach political labels to Shepherd, or his opponent, the unscrupulous
Senator Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) - it is election year - there are no prizes
for guessing which one is the Democrat, which one the Republican.
When Shepherd, with 10 minutes to spare, looks in on a meeting between one of
his aides and a pressure group he wants to influence, he interrupts Sydney Wade
(Annette Bening), an environmental lobbyist, in full flow about his
shortcomings. For him it is love at first sight. She does not know where to
look, and is astounded when later he calls her up and asks for a date.
So how does he go about courting her, this man trapped in the White House?
Reiner began planning his film on the premise that a President today is never
alone, there is always some media nosey parker watching, and things have
changed drastically since the days when John F Kennedy managed to run his
hyperactive love life on the side from the White House without the world
knowing.
While Shepherd's second-time-around romance is deftly handled - he invites her
to a state banquet - Reiner has failed to get to grips with how the media not
merely intrudes into matters which are not its concern, but shapes the agenda
of events. Senator Rumson exploits the affair - ``What a scandal, here is the
father of the nation having sex in the White House while his daughter sleeps
upstairs'' - and Shepherd's poll ratings duly plunge.
But nothing positive is ever done about it by his staff, and the fight back
against this sort of character assassination would have been fascinating to
see. Instead we get romance with Miss Bening, which is fine in its way, but far
from gripping and not a patch on Kevin Kline wooing Sigourney Weaver in Dave,
also about White House amours.
The trouble is that Bening, while undeniably elegant, is really not up to
filling the shoes of the likes of Myrna Loy, Claudette Colbert or Jean Arthur.
She is too twitchy, too eager, and lacks the necessary comic attack. Maybe one
is asking too much, but Miss Weaver made a better stab at it.
Douglas, on the other hand, his locks exquisitely blow-waved, immaculately
suited, is ideally cast. He has managed to slough off the oily, slick, nasty
persona of his sex shocker films like Basic Instinct, and comes over as a man
of some warmth and integrity. His President has the necessary gravitas for the
job, more gravitas, it has to be said, than Bill Clinton can muster, while
Dreyfuss, as his political foe, reeks of smoke-filled rooms and devious doings,
a veritable Tricky Dicky.
Aaron Sorkin's script has its fair share of funny lines, but the sub plot
involving a couple of bills before Congress, one of which, a new anti-gun law,
the President wants passed, the other a green affair she is lobbying for, is
incomprehensible. American audiences may know what is going on, but the
wheeling and dealing left me bothered, bewildered, and far from bewitched.
Martin Sheen, the White House Chief of Staff, Michael J Fox, the Domestic
Policy Adviser, Anna Deavere Smith, the White House Press Secretary, David
Paymer, the resident pollster, and Samantha Mathis, the President's aide, whirl
madly around the great man like a shoal of little fish skittering around a
whale.
These patently difficult scenes, during which the characters talk as they rush
down corridors and through rooms, have been put together by Reiner with great
skill, and undoubtedly convey some impression of what a President's life must
be like. Harassed is the word.

n.A SIMPLE blood test could predict the risk of suffering a stroke, according
to research reported in The Lancet. If the test reveals a high level of amino
acid homocysteine then there is a greater risk within the next 13 years. The
researchers from the Royal Free Hospital, London, examined records from 18
general practices around the country. They found that those with the highest
levels were three times more likely to suffer a stroke than those with the
lowest.
n.OLDER women are to be screened for breast cancer in a new pilot study early
next year. This follows a Health Select Committee report which recommended the
raising of the upper age limit from 64. In the pilot study women up to 69 will
undergo mammography, says a report in GP, the doctors' weekly medical magazine.
n.THOSE suffering from arthritis may be aware that exercise helps, but some
activities are more beneficial than others. A new book, Arthritis: What
Exercise Really Works, by Dava Sobel and Arthur Klein, examines the best. It is
based on more than 1000 people with osteo and rheumatoid arthritis. The results
indicate that a combination of exercise and diet is the most effective
treatment. Copies are available from Robinson Publishing, 7 Kensington Church
Court, London, W84SP, price #5.99.
n.GOOD news for those health professionals who have access to the Internet. A
one-stop medical information shop has just been launched which contains an
entire catalogue of hundreds of CD-ROMS and books, along with an enormous
resource base of health-related issues. We particularly liked the interactive
multi-media CD-ROM on human anatomy. Users can simulate dissection, study
individual structure and examine ethnic make-up. Built by Healthworks Ltd, this
``site'' also hosts Disabilities Access, the on-line based information service
for disabled people and their carers. Here you will find information supplied
by all the leading British charities such as Mind and Mencap. You can also read
their digital magazines. To access the site: http:// www.healthworks.co.uk/
n.SHORT women are more likely to suffer from heart disease: a 14-year study of
more than 121,700 nurses aged between 30 and 55 rated risk according to height.
Women over 5ft 7in tall were 27% less likely to develop angina or have a heart
attack than those who were under 5ft 1in according to a report in the American
Journal of Epidemiology.
n.VERY few parents take the initiative in talking to teenagers about sex, yet a
World Health Organisation report reveals that at least half of all HIV
infections are in the 15-24 age group. Now a new magazine, Talkabout, launched
by the Health Education Board for Scotland, offers practical advice for parents
on how to start discussing the subject. It suggests listening as well as
talking to teenagers, using TV soaps as a possible way of starting a discussion
and advises honesty and openness. Talkabout also suggests parents should not
jump to the conclusion that all teenagers are having sex. While it is true that
research shows that up to half 16-year-olds do have sexual experience, on the
other hand 50% do not. Research shows that sex education at home and school is
likely to encourage youngsters to be more cautious. Copies of Talkabout will be
distributed to health boards throughout Scotland and will be available from
health centres, community centre and surgeries.

GLASGOW achieved their second victory in the Scottish Under-21 Inter-District
Championship with a 22-17 win over North and Midlands at Murrayfield last
night. writes Alan Lorimer.
North and Midlands, with a much improved performance from their first round
effort against Edinburgh, should have made more of their greater territorial
gains.
Their hard working pack, in which Aberdeen University's Fraser Wilson at lock
and Gregor Hayter of Dundee High School FP at No.8 were impressive, had the
better of the forward exchanges, but Glasgow, much the sharper behind the
scrum, made their pace tell to produce two tries by wingers Geoff Caldwell and
Colin McRobert to follow up an early score by flanker Rob Wylie.
Glasgow's other points came from two conversions and one penalty by West of
Scotland full back Tony Greenshields.
For North and Midlands, Jon Goldie, who had a useful outing on the right wing,
and Hayter crossed for tries while stand-off Gerry Tosh kicked two conversions
and one penalty goal.
North and Midlands Under-21 - S Newlands (Aberdeen Univ); J Goldie
(Glenrothes), A Hewett (Stewart's-Melville FP), A McGregor (Aberdeen Univ), A
Wilson (Edinburgh Wanderers); G Tosh (Dundee HSFP), P Simpson (Edinburgh
Academicals); D Massey (Currie) capt, G Scott (Dundee HSFP), G Lambie

I DON'T want to make a point of doing down my own sex, but a consensus of
opinion has grown up that says when it comes to dealing with emotions men are
the hopeless amateurs and women the consummate professionals.
Worse than that, or so the argument goes, while women are busy empathising,
tuning in and generally being all-round sensitive spirits, men wouldn't spot an
emotion if it shook them to the ground and left them with a stomach ulcer.
Which is a point worth bearing in mind.
The choreographer Lloyd Newson said as much after he had a stint in hospital
and noticed that his only visitors were his female friends. ``I realised that
all my relationships with men were about doing things, and all my relationships
with women were about being together,'' he was reported as saying earlier this
year. Furthermore, his friends, both male and female, agreed that in an
emotional crisis it would invariably be a woman to whom they would turn for
support.
Recently the Australian feminist thinker Dale Spender made a similar point as
she promoted her book about women and the Internet. Men, she argued, had made a
computer system that women found intimidating. Had she invented it, she told
one journalist, things would have been the other way round. ``All you would
have to do is make them disclose an emotion as a password,'' she said. ``No man
would ever get in.''
Such sniping at men is, I guess, about as much as we deserve, but there is a
more serious issue at stake. Whatever the social or biological reasons for men
not expressing their feelings - and in evolutionary terms I can think of some
pretty persuasive ones - the things that do not go away are the feelings
themselves.
Women don't have better feelings than men, they're just better at recognising,
reacting and responding to them. The fact that men are less good at that kind
of stuff simply shifts the pressure somewhere else - often to be released in
outbursts of heavy drinking, aggressive sports or a shot of old-fashioned
violence. And whoring of course.
But what do men do when they recognise that for all the tension-release in an
alcoholic binge or a punch-up, these are not things that address the cause of
the tension in the first place?
You're not emotionally equipped to go for a quick weep round at your best
friend's house, you haven't done any sport since your PE teacher said you
lacked basic hand-eye, hand-foot co-ordination, and as far as you can tell
every place offering full-body massage is actually a front for a knocking shop.
Everyone's telling you you've got feelings you should be getting in touch with;
rather fewer are telling us how.
The first time I had a therapeutic massage was five years ago as a Christmas
present. Perhaps that's the best way to start off. I didn't have any physical
complaints, I wasn't aware of any mental tension, I had no great expectations;
it was a present and it sounded like a pleasurable thing to do.
The fact that I have been returning on and off ever since; the fact that after
a few months of sessions I had come face to face with a ``psychosomatic'' pain
I'd spent more than 10 years convincing myself I no longer had; the fact that
even now I view my body (that thing that joins my head to the floor)
differently after each visit, suggests that it's rather more than that.
The official line of the Glasgow-based Society of Holistic Practitioners is
that massage aims to integrate ``the energies of the body, mind and spirit
through a two-way flow of touch and response''.
If that sounds too much like a New Age lifestyle option to you, don't let it
put you off. It is, of course, perfectly acceptable to have a massage purely
for relaxation - as simply and uncomplicatedly as that.
But you don't have to go very deep into it to realise that the body is a
complex receptacle not just of physical strains but emotional tensions as well.
Easing the physical tension can expose an unexpected cargo of forgotten
feelings.
Sometimes that can be scary. One friend of mine stopped being massaged because
he wasn't ready to face what his body was telling him about himself. At other
times it can be an unnerving but revitalising release. I was shocked to find
myself crying during one massage as whatever anxiety I'd somehow locked into my
muscles many years previously was at long last liberated.
Those reactions are two extremes. As often as not there are no blinding
revelations, but rather you find that the knot in your back feels a whole lot
freer, or you notice your voice has dropped an octave because your vocal system
has relaxed. On my most recent visit to my practitioner, Lucinda Cunningham, we
began to realise how much my bodily awareness is centred on my head, like I've
mentally pulled the body's actual physical centre up-wards. It'll take time to
correct something like that, but the theory is that if we do, it will relieve
my head of a good deal of inappropriate physical effort.
As someone whose line of work involves nothing more manual than lifting his
fingers to a keyboard, I tend to have a rather detached view of my body.
Massage helps to make the connections. It's a rare and pleasurable sensation to
discover that your physical identity is just as important as your cerebral one.
``It's a great thing for men to be massaged because it has a quality of
softness that can be quite a challenge to them,'' says Cunningham, who has been
practising for five years. ``It can put them in touch with deep feelings, about
when they were a child, for example, when they were allowed to be loved and
touched.''
Social conditioning denies a whole range of emotional reactions particularly to
men. It's not just that the world at large discourages us from expressing them,
it's that we also discourage ourselves from feeling them.
``In general men have been taught from very early on that feelings are weak,''
says Cunningham. ``Men tend to have a greater investment in their mental
ability. It's a real strain to have to be this big mind all the time.''
I laugh out loud when she suggests that you'll never hear a man say: ``I'm
feeling a bit scared today.'' The idea sounds ludicrous. But why should it? As
an expression of an emotion it would only be honest. But there are some truths
we want neither to say nor to hear.
``Massage gives you permission to have all your feelings,'' says Cunningham.
``It's a relief to be allowed to feel anger or jealousy. No drama, they're your
feelings and they're not bad. It's about being in charge of your feelings
instead of your feelings being in charge of you.''
How you respond to massage, if indeed it's the thing for you at all, depends
very much on you. It's down to your existing physical and mental states and on
the reasons for wanting a massage in the first place.
``Some people come to me and they're very in tune with their bodies and they
immediately feel things,'' Cunningham explains. ``I touch them and they say,
`Oh, I can feel how angry I am in there'. Then they'll drop into their hurt and
they might feel great and their energy will zing. And other people, to begin
with, can't feel anything at all and they're just pleasurably unwinding a
degree of physical tension.''
Importantly, that physical awareness gives you an often more honest indication
of how you are reacting to the world and all its surprises, excitements,
anxieties, passions and problems. The mind is as capable of deceiving itself as
it is of deceiving others, but the body can only tell the truth.

GLASGOW'S former tourism chief has proposed a #1-a-night bed tax in Scotland
generating an estimated #9m a year to promote the industry.
He also wants tourism administration overhauled and put in the hands of
business leaders away from the ``security blanket of the public sector''.
Mr Eddie Friel made his comments yesterday as he delivered his inaugural
lecture as visiting professor of tourism at Strathclyde University's Scottish
Hotel School.
He also questioned the new structure of area tourist boards, claiming the
Government-led reorganisation was little more than a game of musical chairs
which would do little to harness the dynamism of the Scottish business
community.
``There are, thankfully, individual Scottish companies performing well within
the industry, but what of the plethora of organisations supported by public
funds? One thing is certain, if we were starting with a blank sheet of paper,
the last thing we would draw is what we have today.
``Does anyone really believe that the creation of the Argyll, the Isles, Loch
Lomond, Stirling, and Trossachs Tourist Board was the result of consumer
research into recognised brand names? Or was this the dead hand of bureaucracy
divorced from the market-place?''
Tourism, he insisted, was much too important to be the plaything of amateurs,
and it was terrifying that the new boards were to become statutory bodies.
``Scotland, who exported the ideas inherent in an enterprise culture across the
world, is creating a situation where you will need an Act of Parliament to
remove incompetence,'' he claimed.
He felt that more power should be given to successful business executives so
that tourism could become more accountable and more oriented towards results.
He also brought into question the present funding arrangements of tourist
boards - receiving money from local councils and Government agencies - which he
described as an annual begging bowl principle.
Proposing the bed tax, which operates in many US cities, he estimated that a
#1-a-night tax, with an annual occupancy rate of 50%, would generate over #9m -
#1m more than current local authority funding of tourist boards.
The cash should then be matched by the Government through VAT on tourist
services, to fund a Visit Scotland programme.
Mr Friel argued that the Scottish Tourist Board should then have no financial
input into the area tourist boards, and no control over their management, which
would be freed to create a more dynamic results-oriented tourism sector by
employing more professional managers.
The result would be a more focused concentration on the development of staying
visitors, a basis for funding destination-marketing agencies, allow performance
measurement, improve the quality of customer care, and create recognisable
brand identities for what the boundaries of the area tourist boards should be.
He told the students: ``Tourism is much too important to be the plaything of
amateurs. Places are in the business of marketing the difference, and the
difference is our history, heritage, and culture.
``Scotland has no need to apologise for its history, heritage, and culture, but
in our tourism administration we have chosen a poor delivery mechanism to
convince the world it is worthy of attention.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Tourist Board said it was understandable that such
lectures had to provoke comment, but it was premature to decry the new boards
before they were fully operational.
A widespread consultation exercise showed the majority of people had wanted a
reduction in the number of area tourists boards, which is what was happening,
he said.
The STB was also not in favour of a bed tax as the industry was already heavily
taxed.

<HEADLINE>Head of export control forced to retract MoD `restraints' allegations in Iran weapons inquiry DTI climbdown over arms claims</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975011907</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry was forced to stage a humiliating
climbdown last night after a senior official claimed Defence Ministers tried to
block access to crucial papers in the arms-to-Iran affair.
The head of the DTI's export control organisation, Dr John Meadway, earlier
told a Commons committee that the Ministry of Defence had placed
``constraints'' on access to papers seized from the arms company at the heart
of the affair.
He said the decision not to allow DTI investigators to see the documents seized
by MoD police followed discussions at ``ministerial level'' between the two
departments.
However, amid signs of a full-scale Whitehall row, the DTI last night issued a
retraction.
``There is no suggestion any efforts were made by the Ministry of Defence to
block access to the papers,'' a DTI spokeswoman said.
Although the then-President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine discussed
the papers with Mr Roger Freeman, then a Defence Minister, he was seeking
information only to answer questions in a parliamentary debate.
The inter-departmental dispute marked an extraordinary start to the trade and
industry select committee's arms-to-Iran investigation.
The inquiry follows a Commons statement last June by Mr Heseltine when he
disclosed components for naval guns, made by the BMARC company and licensed for
export to Singapore by the DTI, ``could well'' have been destined for Iran in
contravention of Government guidelines.
The DTI said Dr Meadway had been taken by surprise when MPs on the select
committee started asking him about the papers as they had not been thought
relevant to the department's internal inquiry.
That inquiry had concentrated on how the DTI continued to grant export licences
to BMARC despite receiving specific intelligence in 1988 which could have
linked it to attempts to use Singapore as a diversionary destination in order
to evade restrictions on arms sales to Iran during the Iran-Iraq War.
The DTI inquiry concluded it would have been ``extremely difficult'' for
officials to have connected the intelligence report - which referred to BMARC's
former parent company, the Swiss firm Oerlikon - to BMARC.
Between 1985 and 1991, BMARC submitted 88 export applications listing Singapore
as a final destination and a further six with Singapore as an intermediate
destination.
However, only two people in the DTI had seen the 1988 intelligence report, Dr
Meadway told the committee.
``I think the likelihood is that it didn't ring any alarm bells because it
didn't appear to refer to exports that originated from the UK,'' he said.
``When the report was looked at in isolation, it didn't stand out to make any
of the readers think there was something worrying about this from a UK point of
view.''
Committee chairman Martin O'Neill suggested that Singapore was ``well known''
in the 1980s as a conduit for arms destined for other countries.
Dr Meadway replied: ``We have no documentary evidence to suggest that that was
taken on board in the DTI.''
He admitted, however, it was known that as far back as 1985 Sweden had changed
its policy relating to Singapore because of such concerns.
In the late 1980s, export licence applications had reached a peak of 90,000 a
year, creating tremendous pressure on the 38 licensing staff involved in
processing them.
To the obvious incredulity of some MPs, he said they had had to rely to a large
extent on the honesty of the exporters when they were making applications.
Committee member Roger Berry said: ``It is the easiest thing in the world - a
five-year-old could do it - to get round any restrictions on arms exports in
the UK.''
Dr Meadway replied: ``Obviously the system can be evaded but reputable British
companies don't spend their time doing that.''

Baron Matthews of Southgate, born December 5, 1919, died December 5, 1995
WITHIN the hour of winning control of the virtually bankrupt Express Newspapers
in June 30, 1977, Victor Matthews arrived in Fleet Street in his Rolls-Royce
TRA.1, to inspect his new property.
Waiting to greet the new boss from Trafalgar House were the Beaverbrook board
and top management. The alleged carpet-biting Jocelyn Stevens, then
vice-chairman, did the introductions.
When my turn came Jocelyn said: ``Ian McColl heads our Scottish operation.''
There was no handshake. A saturnine Mr Matthews advanced, almost eyeball to
eyeball. In a Cockney accent he demanded: ``Tell me - does the Scottish Daily
Express believe in Dee-volution?
My response: ``Not only 100%, sir, but 1000%.''
My new boss: ``That's a pity - I don't.''
End of conversation. End of the forthright devolution policy laid down by Lord
Beaverbrook and continued by Sir Max Aitken.
At the next main board meeting the devolution issue was discussed. Jocelyn
Stevens said it would never do to have the Scottish and London Daily Express
proclaiming different policies.
I told Chairman Matthews - not yet ennobled - that Lord Beaverbook in the
sixties instructed me to attack the then Dr Beeching's savage rail cuts in
Scotland. This we did with relish and labelled him Butcher Beeching, while the
London Express were praising him.
The London editor soon phoned me to protest: ``What's going on? We're thinking
Dr Beeching is saving the railways.'' I replied: ``I think, sir, perhaps you
should speak to Lord Beaverbrook.'' The editor did not respond.
Chairman Matthews was unimpressed by advocacy.
``You've had your innings,'' he said, ``the Express is against devolution.''
Thus it fell to me to institute the ``No to devo'' campaign - one of the
greatest U-turns in Scottish journalism and the No's won in the 1979
referendum.
Lord Matthews from modest beginnings became chairman of a building firm,
Trollope &amp; Colls, which in turn was taken over by the conglomerate Trafalgar
House, headed by himself and Sir Nigel Broackes.
Later Sir Nigel was to write an astonishing letter to the London Evening
Standard. This said Trafalgar House had bought the Express to give Victor a new
interest in life at a time when personal matters were not exactly going well
for him. Victor Matthews in my view made a success of his Express chairmanship.
Realising that the Daily Express would never again reach the three or four
million circulation mark, he created the Daily Star in Manchester with
virtually the same staff to rival the tabloid brigade of the Sun and Mirror.
Again he succeeded with the expert accounting assistance of Mr Ian Irvine in
unlocking the fabled Reuter gold. This led to a very substantial infusion of
Reuter cash to newspaper shareholders.
How came the unlikely Matthews to boss the Express?
In the last midsummer days of Express control in 1977, millionaire Sir Max
Aitken and his board, which included three other millionaires, agonised over
the need to raise #10m in cash to pay off debts and bank loans.
Three suitors were sought out - Rupert Murdoch, Sir James Goldsmith, Lord
Rothermere - in a series of tortuous negotiations. All three were rejected for
various reasons by the controlling Beaverbrook Foundation.
The unlikely Trafalgar House came into view. At first they were not believed.
What did they know about newspapers? Trafalgar House persisted with an offer of
hard cash with no strings or conditions.
Finally Express Newspapers were bought out by Trafalgar House for an incredible
#14m. In due course Victor, now Lord Matthews of Southgate, sold out to United
Newspapers, headed by Lord Stevens of Ludgate for what is now reckoned to be
worth around #300m.
Victor retired to the Channel Islands with an estimated #8m fortune.

A TURKEY is not going to have its neck wrung at Christmas, after crusading
vegetarian Linda McCartney paid #3000 to save it from ending up stuffed on the
festive table.
The wife of ex-Beatle Paul McCartney out-bid all comers to buy the bird, the
star lot at a livestock auction at Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire.
She was responding to an appeal from animal lover Janet Taylor.
The turkey, which weighs around 50lb, will celebrate Christmas in comfort at Ms
Taylor's animal sanctuary, and the #3000 goes to a local charity, BRMB Cash For
Kids.
Mrs McCartney, well-known for her campaigning on behalf of animals and her
vegetarian convenience food range, said: ``The only reason I bid as much as I
did was because the money goes to a good cause and I saved a life.''
Free As A Bird - the title of the first Beatles single for 25 years - was
released this week and is in the running for Christmas Number One.
Ms Taylor, who has 350 animals at her 60-acre sanctuary at Broad Green,
Worcestershire, said the bird would have two female turkeys to keep him company.
``I did this because I am appalled that anyone can just walk in off the street
and buy these birds to slaughter themselves.''

A WISHAW man said yesterday he would return to the spot where his wife was
gunned down while on an aid convoy mission to Bosnia.
Mr Alan Witcutt plans to return to the notorious Sniper's Alley in Sarajevo on
an Edinburgh Direct Aid mission.
Yesterday, he revealed he had given up hope of the Bosnian-Serb militia sniper
who killed his wife Christine ever being brought to justice.
Mr Witcutt, 65, said: ``I remember the shooting so vividly, almost as if it
happened yesterday. We were going through this wide boulevard with shells and
gunfire all around. There was a sudden break in the barrage, then I heard a
single shot from a tower block near the road. Christine was in the vehicle
behind mine. I immediately knew something was wrong but we had to keep driving
about another mile to get out of the gunfire.''
The bullet entered through a side window, struck a metal partition and
ricocheted, hitting Mrs Witcutt.

TELEVISION broadcaster and programme maker Carlton Communications is
maintaining its strong growth trend with another good set of results for the
year to September.
Profits rose 30% to #246.7m and earnings per share were 21% ahead at 65.3p.
Dividends are raised 14% to 23.6p. Year-end net cash stood at #90.6m.
Carlton holds the London weekday and Midlands ITV licences following its
purchase of Central, which is now fully integrated and yielding the cost
savings expected. The group is also a major producer of programmes for the
whole network, spending #160m a year on new work. Successful series include
Inspector Morse, Soldier, Soldier and Peak Practice. Its library of programmes
is also building up rapidly.
Broadcast television overall raised operating profits by 71% to #123m helped by
a full contribution from Central. Carlton claims to be increasing its share of
television advertising. The other strong performer was video and sound products
where profits rose 43% to #32.5m.
Video production and distribution saw a 4% dip to #60.7m, due to continuing
losses in Carlton Home Entertainment, which makes and distributes video and
music compilations, and lower margins on video cassette production. Home
entertainment has been reorganised but it will take time to realise the
benefits.
The main business of the division is the manufacture and distribution of
pre-recorded cassettes by the Technicolor subsidiary for the video retail
market. The video recorder population in the US and Europe is projected to grow
at 3% a year. Titles processed included The Lion King which sold 28 million
copies. Capacity was increased and production speeded up to meet demand.
The fourth division, film and television services, made 9% more at #41.6m.
Carlton shares closed 3p firmer at 1003p.

<HEADLINE>Contract signed with former Scottish Milk vice-chairman Dansco goes direct to milk producers</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS, Farming Editor</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975011912</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LANARKSHIRE dairy farmer Jim Brown, former vice-chairman of Scottish Milk, will
from next month be selling his milk to a direct purchaser new to the Scottish
scene - Dansco Dairy Products of Loanhead.
Mr Brown is Dansco's first direct supplier, but the company indicated yesterday
that it was prepared to consider, over time, switching from its existing
Scottish Milk contract to 100% direct supplies.
Peter Eddleston, the company's technical director, confirmed at a news
conference at Mr Brown's farm - Gaindykehead, near Airdrie - that he was in
talks with three other dairy farmers in that area. The company, a subsidiary of
McKain Foods, is also speaking to dairy farmers in Wales about supplies for its
plant there.
Dansco uses 140 million litres of milk a year - 35 million in Scotland - for
the manufacture of mozzarella cheese for the burgeoning pizza market. One
reason for the decision to begin sourcing milk directly from farmers was a lack
of confidence in the ability of the co-operatives (Scottish Milk and Milk
Marque) to meet its demand for a consistent supply of high quality milk, Mr
Eddleston said.
Mr Brown resigned from the board of Scottish Milk in July when it became
apparent he was not going to succeed to the chairmanship. He had earlier
believed he had almost total support from his eight fellow directors.
He conceded that a final split with the co-operative was inevitable but took
consolation from the fact that he was opening a new door for producers. The
Dansco contract was very attractive, he said, and would pay close to 26p a
litre compared to the 24.3p he had received from Scottish Milk in October. Mr
Brown has 140 Holstein cows and produces up to 2500 litres a day.
In the wake of deregulation, producers should look at all the options, he said.
The Dansco contract would reward farmers who produced high quality milk in
hygienic conditions. It was also the first contract in Scotland to pay a bonus
for a level supply pattern, he added.
In contrast, he said, many Scottish Milk suppliers were unhappy at deductions
made from their monthly cheques because of the payments system the co-operative
was using.
Mr Eddleston said that when de-regulation came in last November his company had
had the impression that farmers wanted to support the co-operatives. Dansco
decided not to rock the boat and to buy from them. ``Unfortunately it hasn't
worked,'' he said. ``We find that to make sure of production we have to have a
direct interest. In Scotland we are concerned about getting sufficient milk to
make our product.''
He expected the Dansco price to farmers would be somewhere near the top of the
payments league table.
John Duncan, chairman of Scottish Milk, said last night that it had had no
complaint from Dansco about difficulty in obtaining supplies. In the past,
mozzarella manufacturers had not been at the higher end of the price spectrum.
The news of the arrival of another direct buyer on the scene comes in the wake
of an announcement from the Caledonian Cheese Company at Stranraer that it is
anxious to begin direct sourcing from farms in its area because of a shortage
of supplies.
Mr Duncan said Scottish Milk was facing up to the competition and believed it
could offer a price structure which would make it very difficult for
competitors to draw producers away.
``We have been having a series of meetings with farmers up and down the country
and have had a very positive response,'' he said. ``They believe we are going
the right way about facing up to the challenges.''

SCOTTISH local authority leaders yesterday called on Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth to give the new unitary councils a fresh start by writing off the loan
debt which they will inherit from the regions and districts.
Cosla's Labour president, Councillor Rosemary MacKenna, said there was an
English precedent for such a move as the debts of the public water authorities
there had been written off when the industry was privatised.
It also emerged yesterday that the Government was considering writing off the
#1500m debts of the three new Scottish public water authorities but the
Scottish Office insisted this was a technical matter and would not provide them
with any more cash.
Mr Forsyth has already announced that their rises in charges would be capped at
6%.
So far as the new water authorities are concerned, the Scottish Office insists
any debt reduction would mean their external income from grant and other
sources would be reduced to take account of the write-off. The same would apply
to a write-off for council debts, as the amount of money councils receive from
grant would also be reduced because debt charges are funded pound for pound in
this way.
Cosla experts, however, argue that spending is supported only at a level of 85%
and council tax payers have to pick up the difference. Because of this, debt
reduction would have a significant impact.
The background to Cosla's call for debts to be written off is the anger of
council leaders about a clampdown on their debt levels announced last week by
Mr Forsyth.
Cosla has already warned that, as a result of these ``draconian measures'',
council investment in construction would be slashed by more than #100m next
year and double that a year later when 50% of capital receipts had to be used
to pay off debt.
Mrs McKenna said the Scottish Secretary should ``wipe the slate clean'' and
give the councils a fresh start, so they could provide better services for the
people of Scotland.

Donald MacAngus Patience, venture funder; born March 10, 1937, died November
30, 1995
THE death of Donald Patience, in Glasgow on St Andrew's Day, after a brief
illness, robs the Scottish venture capital community of one of its most
inspired and inspiring practitioners. In a sometimes grey world where balance
sheets and business plans can crowd out more human values and priorities,
Donald Patience excelled because he cared deeply about the people he chose to
back and the ventures they were embarked on.
``I like to see the bricks going up,'' he would say, with a chuckle. Or
``That's a great wee company,'' as he added to his already prodigious knowledge
of diverse industries, countless businesses, and the rich human glue which
makes them work.
First at ICFC, the forerunner of development capital group 3i, then from 1982
onwards, as director of the growing investment arm of the Scottish Development
Agency, Patience demonstrated a colourful brilliance of judgment which paid his
employers handsome returns.
Just this year, for example, the sale of Spider Systems to new American owners
netted Scottish Enterprise (the inheritor of the SDA's equity portfolio) a gain
of some #7m. Donald Patience was not infallible. But he produced individual
returns of that magnitude again and again. And, in the process, he helped some
of Scotland's emerging companies - from Inveresk Research and Stagecoach to
Calluna - to grow and flourish.
Donald Patience was also a hugely influential teacher. The school of Patience -
former staff from both his 3i and SDA days - today represents a powerful
network right across the investment industry. Former colleague Dr George
Mathewson of the Royal Bank, who worked with Donald Patience at ICFC and
recruited him into the SDA, says: ``He was a brilliant talent. One of the best
business minds I've ever met.''
Born in the Ross-shire village of Fearn, where he was laid to rest yesterday,
Donald Patience was schooled at Tain Royal Academy and then completed an
honours degree in chemistry at the Dundee campus of St Andrews University. He
spent four years as a research scientist with GEC and a further three as a
production manager with EMI in Middlesex before, in 1967, joining ICFC (3i) as
area manager in the group's Liverpool office.
There he honed his remarkable ability to find the right ventures to back. He
would scour the situations vacant columns to see which local firms were hiring
staff. He was not averse to phoning companies up because he had seen their vans
in the street and liked the look of their livery. After the salesmanship and
the introductions came the deals. Liverpool grew to be second only to London in
the ICFC hierarchy.
Inevitably Donald moved south eventually to manage the entire London office.
Between 1980 and 1982, he was director of FCI, the arm of ICFC devoted to
investments in quoted companies. But the nitty-gritty of general management was
not what inspired him.
Later, at the SDA, he did little to disguise his irrita-   tion at the
political wrangling over whether the agency should be in the venture capital
business at all. For Donald Patience, doing good deals was what mattered. He
had even, George Mathewson recalls, pioneered a scheme in Glasgow to lend money
to youngsters to fund their entrepreneurial instincts.
Scottish Development Finance, as the SDA offshoot was known, was built around
Patience's prodigious personal skills. ``Under his guidance SDF became a
successful and credible player within the venture capital industry in Scotland,
while at the same time helping to create and safeguard many thousands of
jobs,'' says Calum Paterson, SDF's current head.
With the threat that SDF's portfolio might be privatised and the subsequent
transition to Scottish Enterprise, Patience's enthusiasm for the challenge
visibly cooled. In May 1993 he took early retirement and became a corporate
banking consultant to the Royal Bank, with a desk in its Glasgow head office
and a mission to raise the deal flow.      He also retained the
vice-chairmanship of SDF's advisory board.
Donald Patience is survived by his mother, his wife Pat, three daughters
Arlene, Caroline and Louise, and his beloved grandchildren. His legacy to
corporate Scotland will burn bright for years to come.

<HEADLINE>Dutch potato growers invest #3m in brown rot screening</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975011916</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DUTCH potato growers have spent #3m since the beginning of October in an
attempt to protect their #700m-a-year seed and ware industry from the ravages
of brown rot.
From the moment in late September when a Dutch farmer found his country's first
brown rot tuber until now, four teams of specially recruited workers have been
collecting between 6000 and 7000 samples a day to test for the disease. The
screening programme is due to be completed by Christmas, with no Dutch seed
being released for sale either within the Netherlands or for export until a
clean result is recorded for the consignment.
The test and isolation programme, which has so far cost #3m, will be paid for
by growers, with no indication of any contribution being made by the Dutch
government.
``To date we have found brown rot on 46 farms, traceable to clonal contact,''
said Dr Marie-Josee Jenniskens, head of phyto sanitary development at the Dutch
Ministry of Agriculture's Plant Protection Service at Wageningen.
``We found those farms during our first two weeks of testing and have had no
confirmed cases since then.''
Under terms agreed with the EU's plant health standing committee all potatoes
grown within a 3km radius of each of the 46 diseased fields have been subjected
to close examination, an undertaking which immediately affected no fewer than
700 farmers.
The testing procedure for seed involves collecting a small sample from 200
tubers for every 25 tonnes of seed and examining each one for brown rot
bacteria. Any which prove suspect are put through a more detailed examination
using a growth test involving tomato plants.
Seed from the 46 diseased fields has been removed from commerical sale and is
due for disposal under the control of the Plant Protection Service.
``Each of the 46 fields will be removed from potato production for five
years,'' said Dr Jenniskens. ``They will then be put into grass for three years
after which they will be allowed to grow non-potato crops for a further two
years before being allowed to go back into potatoes.''
While farmers in the Netherlands are happy the problem appears to have been
contained, many have had to accept a disrupted programme for grading and sales.
Polders farmer Piet Koekoek was anxious to stress, however, that nothing was
being left to chance on his own farm. ``It has obviously taken us a lot longer
to move our seed this year, sometimes leaving us to wait several days for test
results to come through before we can trade,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Prisons chief hits out `No easy answer' to jail suicides</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975011917</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE head of the Scottish Prison Service yesterday warned that simplistic
solutions were not the answer to the spate of suicides in Scotland's only
women's prison.
Three young women have hanged themselves in the remand unit of Cornton Vale
prison, near Stirling, in the past six months. In the most recent incident, a
prisoner was found hanged in her cell on Sunday night. Two other suicides
occurred within a four-day spell in June.
SPS chief executive Eddie Frizzell called a news conference yesterday at the
prison to put the record straight about the latest tragedy, although he
declined to comment in detail on the three deaths as they are under official
investigation.
He said he was concerned at speculation over the reasons for the deaths and the
apparent need to find ``simplistic solutions'' before any full investigations
had been completed.
Talk of a sense of ``crisis'' in the prison was also dismissed, although staff
were distressed and angry at some of the media coverage. Mr Frizzell warned
that speculation about the reasons behind the deaths could increase tension in
Cornton Vale, where he said relationships between prisoners and staff had been
``among the best of any prison in Scotland''.
While the chief executive conceded that Cornton Vale had a higher number of
prisoners considered at risk, he also cited the prison's much higher
staff-prisoner ratio, which was reflected in its being more expensive to run
than other comparable establishments.
There had been only four suicides at the prison since it opened in 1974.
Mr Frizzell made his comments after a three-hour visit to the prison, during
which he chatted to prisoners and staff, mainly in the Romeo remand wing, where
the three deaths occurred.
Mother-of-two Joanne O'Reilly, 26, was found hanging by a bedsheet in her cell
on Sunday. Kelly Holland, 17, and Arlene Elliot, 17, died in June. A fatal
accident inquiry into the deaths of Ms Holland and Ms Elliot has been adjourned
until next month.
Mr Frizzell defended the suicide prevention strategy operated by the SPS, which
is responsible for a prison population of 5800.
Ten suspected or confirmed suicides have occurred this year in Scottish jails,
compared with 16 last year. The previous annual average had been six or seven,
although nine were confirmed in 1992.
The results of two expert studies commissioned by the SPS to assess ways it can
prevent jail suicides are expected early next year. Mr Frizzell spoke of his
determination to establish the underlying reasons for the recent cluster of
deaths at Cornton Vale but emphasised that it was difficult to establish any
common thread to jail suicides.
The general mood in Cornton Vale during his visit had been very sombre, he
said. ``I have seen as many red-eyed staff here today as I have red-eyed
prisoners.'' There was also a mood of anger among staff, who were frustrated
about the ``rush to judgment'' over the cause of the deaths.
``That causes me great concern, because they (the staff) are committed,'' the
chief executive said, pointing out that staff had been working rest-days and
coming in voluntarily to deal with the situation. ``I have seen the best
example anywhere in this service of interaction between staff and prisoners and
care.''
Mr Frizzell rejected suggestions that Cornton Vale was understaffed. ``It is
always the case when something happens that people say we need more staff. But
we have to get away from looking at the question of suicides in prison as being
all about resources. It is about what you do with the resources and whether you
make procedures work or not.''
SPS staff locked up 184 prisoners in Cornton Vale on Tuesday night. Of those,
48 were untried and on remand in the Romeo wing - 41 aged 21 or older and the
other seven younger than 21.
Thirty-one of the prisoners in the Romeo wing were subject to observation. Four
were on strict suicide supervision, 21 supervised every 15 minutes, while six
were checked every hour.
Measures already taken to cut down on suicides include the introduction of a
new type of ``at risk'' cell - 10 of which have been completed at a cost of
#30,000 each. Canvas gowns and blankets have been replaced with non-tear
clothes and sleeping bags, and ``crash packs'' of resuscitation equipment in
prisons have also been introduced.

Living in Oblivion, directed by Tom De Cillo who, a few years back, made Johnny
Suede starring Brad Pitt. The pop-eyed, cadaverous Steve Buscemi plays Nick
Reve, director of a low-budget film called, naturally, Living in Oblivion. We
follow his struggles with his cast, his camerman, his confused old mother, who
turns up out of the blue and interrupts filming, and a distinctly bolshie dwarf
who objects strenuously to being used in the fantasy dream sequence.
The film works at a series of levels. We shift between the crew at work in the
studio on Living in Oblivion, to scenes from the film itself, to dreams the
actors are having, the reality being in colour, the imaginary stuff in black
and white. Buscemi holds the whole fragile concoction together with a most
polished performance, abetted by Catherine Keener as Nicole, his leading lady.
The best moment comes when Chad (James Le Gros), the leading man, a truly awful
soap star with an ego as large as his talent is small, plays his big love scene
with Nicole.
It is all about an affair they once had and getting together again, but we
know, although the director does not, that the pair spent the previous night
together, and she hates him, while Chad loves himself. Le Gros gives a
magnificent display of rampant ego, allegedly based on an actor not a million
miles from Brad Pitt.
Since DeCillo asked Pitt to play the part, which he would have done, had he
been free, perhaps that is just gossip, or maybe Pitt is as difficult and dumb
as Chad, in which case he would have agreed to play the role since he would not
would have understood the double send-up. Either way, this is one of the best
and funniest films about movie-making.
Edward Burns's The Brothers McMullen takes a perceptive look at the problems
faced by three brothers, Jack (Jack Mulcahy), Barry (played by Burns) and
Patrick (Mike McGlone), brought up to be good Irish-American Catholic boys
after the death of their father. The film, which Burns also wrote and directed,
opens with their father's funeral at which their mother announces she is off to
Ireland to marry the man she really loves, they must fend for themselves, and
not make the same mistakes she did.
Doing so proves difficult for the trio. Jack, who is happily married, gets an
attack of the seven-year itch and is tempted into a pointless affair with a
neurotic woman; Barry, who is serially single, begins to wonder whether it is
time to settle down with what could be the right girl if only he would stop
wasting her time; while Patrick, throughly confused by what the Church says he
should do, and what he feels like doing, turns to his brothers for advice.
The playing is extremely good and Burns's script is very observant and while
making mock of what it is like to be Irish, American and in thrall to the Pope,
manages to make some serious points as well. Would-be Scots film-makers could
benefit from taking a look at it.

CONSUMER watchdogs yesterday pointed the finger at children's favourite fish
dish.
Only two out of 27 UK fish finger brands tested contained more than 65% fish,
says a report in the Consumers' Association's Which? magazine.
Bird's Eye Fish Fingers in Crispy Oven Batter were top with 70% fish.
Somerfield Fish Fingers came last with 49.9%.
Other coated fish products had an even poorer fish content, says the report.
Five out of 28 brands of coated fish fillets and steaks tested contained less
than 50% fish.
Some had so little fish they should not be labelled ``fish products'', said
Which?
Bernard Matthews Fish Dinosaurs were worst, with 37% fish. Macfish New Low Fat
Cod Fillets were top with 75.3%.
``In the UK, the minimum meat content of meat products has to be listed on the
label. We think applying a similar rule to coated fish products would help
consumers discover exactly what they are buying,'' said Which?

A DRUG is being tested which could help to eliminate flu epidemics, it emerged
yesterday.
Known by the code GG-167, the drug does not kill the virus but stops it being
spread around the body.
This should make it easier for the body's immune system to mop up the infection
before it can properly take hold.
Glaxo chief executive Richard Sykes is reported to have given the project top
priority.
Trials were delayed last year because there were not enough flu patients on
which to test the drug.
The initial trial - launched in 1993 and involving 160 volunteers - showed that
flu patients who took GG-167 recovered more quickly than those who did not.
Glaxo has now started recruiting 1500 flu volunteers in the US and Europe for a
bigger trial.
After one more trial, the company expects to apply for a licence to market the
drug in about a year's time. If approved, GG-167 may be on sale from about 1998.
Flu kills an average 3000 to 4000 people in Britain each winter, mostly
affecting the elderly and people with respiratory problems or weak immune
systems.
The drug was developed using powerful computer programmes which can produce
graphics showing the structure of complex molecules in 3-D.
It works by blocking the action of an enzyme called neuraminidase which allows
the virus to escape from infected cells and spread.
Scientists designed new molecules which bind to the enzyme and jam it, in the
same way that a key is jammed in a lock.
The drug was first discovered by an Australian scientist and has been developed
with financial backing from Glaxo by the small Australian company Biota.
Glaxo has paid #1.6m to Biota, with a further #1.5m to come if the drug is
approved by the licensing authorities.
.q.Paracetamol and a hot drink with honey and lemon will probably fight a cold
as effectively as expensive brand medicines, says a report today.
Over-the-counter remedies often offer more drugs than necessary to fight the
symptoms of a cold, according to the Consumers' Association's Which? magazine.

BBC Scotland is set to gatecrash Edinburgh's big Hogmanay party this year when
it celebrates the arrival of New Year direct from Princes Street.
The traditional before-the-bells programme will be hosted by Lorraine Kelly and
Gordon Kennedy and feature live music from the Kinks, Edwyn Collins, Eddi
Reader, Big Country, and Gary Glitter.
More than 250,000 revellers are expected to attend the capital's big bash and
BBC Scotland will broadcast the show live. Among the guests providing
(pre-recorded) seasonal greetings will be Ronnie Corbett and, two of the
best-known Scots in the business, Paul Gascoigne and Terry Wogan.
In what is one of the biggest nights of the year for Scottish viewers, the
programme will be preceded by a new one-woman show from Dorothy Paul, and the
traditional Hogmanay visit to the manse of Scotland's cheeriest minister, the
Rev.I.M Jolly.
Earlier in the evening, there will be a special tribute to Gavin Hastings, who
retired from international rugby this year, with a film which looks back on his
life and career.

RANGERS and Aberdeen footballers who were involved in controversial on-field
incidents during an explosive match between the clubs in Glasgow last month are
not to be prosecuted.
The procurator-fiscal for Glasgow said last night he had considered a police
report on the match at Ibrox on November 11 and had decided ``to take no
proceedings against any person on this occasion''.
A brief statement issued by the Crown Office on the fiscal's behalf did not
name any of the footballers involved - or say how many had figured in
investigations by Strathclyde police - but Rangers players Paul Gascoigne, John
Brown, and Alan McLaren, along with Billy Dodds of Aberdeen, are widely
believed to have been involved in the police investigations.
Meanwhile, Gascoigne was sent off in last night's Champions' League match
between Borussia Dortmund and Rangers in Germany.
He was ordered off after his second bookable offence in the match, apparently
dissent, having earlier been yellow-carded for fouling an opponent.
The decision not to prosecute the four players came just a day after the same
procurator-fiscal confirmed that another Aberdeen player, Stewart McKimmie,
would not be prosecuted for an elbowing incident which led to his being sent
off in a match against Partick Thistle at Firhill in Glasgow last Saturday.
McKimmie, the Aberdeen captain, was also fined #500 by his club.
The four players involved in the match at Ibrox - dubbed the Ibrox Four - were
the latest Scottish footballers to be caught up in the debate about how far the
law should intervene in matters previously assumed to be for football's
governing bodies to sort out.
None of the four was booked in the game but two of them, Gascoigne and Brown,
were suspended for one game by an SFA disciplinary hearing on November 30.
Television viewers saw Gascoigne appear to be involved in several elbowing
incidents in the match and in what some construed as a head-butt.
It was alleged that Gascoigne's reaction to a challenge by John Inglis was
unacceptable and the Rangers midfield player also was involved in another
incident with Paul Bernard. Brown and McLaren got themselves involved in an
incident with Dodds.
Police were asked by Crown officials to provide a report and further inquiries
were then ordered. The final police report was submitted at the end of last
week.
The full statement issued by the Crown Office said: ``The procurator-fiscal has
now considered reports submitted by Strathclyde Police, together with other
relevant material and information relating to incidents at the Rangers-Aberdeen
football match at Ibrox stadium on November 11. ``The procurator-fiscal has
decided to take no proceedings against any person on this occasion.''
Rangers expressed relief that the police investigation into their three players
had been dropped. Speaking before Rangers' match against Borussia Dortmund, the
Ibrox club's vice-chairman, Mr Donald Finlay QC, said: ``Although it has taken
a long time, I am delighted it has come to a conclusion.
``I am a bit concerned that the Stewart McKimmie case could be decided within
24 hours while our own case took longer.''
Mr Findlay said: ``Now the players can get back playing football again without
this hanging over them. Rangers would be happy to attend any meeting with the
relevant authorities to apply guidelines.''
Rangers and every other club and also the SFA, for that matter, still believe
they should be allowed to police football themselves but if procurators-fiscal
are intent on reaching into the game, then guidelines must be laid down.
``We must have clear indications if others are going to interfere in future,''
Mr Findlay said.
The secretary of the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association, Mr Tony
Higgins, was also delighted that investigations into the incidents involving
the players had ended without further action being taken.
``Hopefully the procurator-fiscal will never get involved again but lessons
must be learned by players about their behaviour on the pitch,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Mr Dennis Canavan MP, convener of the all-party Scottish Sport
committee in the House of Commons, has arranged a meeting with the Lord
Advocate, Donald Mackay, and Solicitor-General Paul Cullen, on Tuesday, along
with a delegation from the committee to discuss the role of procurators-fiscal
in sports events, particularly football matches.
He said: ``I can't speak on behalf of the committee before meeting the Lord
Advocate but my own view is that I can well understand that there is no way in
which behaviour on football pitches can be immune from prosecution.
``But, nevertheless, there is considerable public concern about inconsistencies
of recent decisions by procurators-fiscaland I think that it would be helpful
if the Lord Advocate were to publicly state the criteria on which their
decisions are taken whether to prosecute or not.''
Meanwhile, Gascoigne is likely to be given the SFA version of a ``slap on the
wrist'' for his playful slap on the rear which offended a member of the public
so much that he or she wrote, suggesting the Ibrox man was bringing the game
into disrepute.
The complainant saw a picture of Gascoigne pinching the rear end of Hearts
striker Alan Lawrence during the Premier division game at Ibrox on October 21
and, as a result, the executive committee looked into the possibility that the
English internationalist had ``brought the game into disrepute''.
The SFA wrote to Rangers about the incident and the club has responded by
letter but it is understand that the committee's decision, which will probably
be announced today, will be a minor admonition.
Meanwhile, Gascoigne will have to sit through the next two league matches,
against Partick Thistle on Saturday and Motherwell on December 19, as a result
of suspensions imposed by the SFA.

Fred Urquhart, writer; born July 12, 1912, died December 2, 1995
THIS is a season of sad departures for Scottish literature. Elspeth Davie died
recently, and now Fred Urquhart, another of our seriously neglected writers,
has gone.
Here was a young writer who found his own authentic voice, not through the
imposition of university courses, but through the developments of his own
talents in the hard school of life. Born in Edinburgh, he attributed his love
of reading to his granny, who apparently kept fourpenny detective novels in the
pocket of her pinny to dip into during the household chores. On the family's
removal to Wigtownshire he went to Stranraer Academy, transferring to Broughton
Secondary when they moved back to Edinburgh.
Urquhart's father was a chauffeur, and the family's association with big houses
and estates provided Fred with the widest range of social contact for his
future fiction. As he recalled: ``I spent a lot of time in the drawing-rooms
and the servants' halls - the best of both worlds.'' His novel, Palace of Green
Days (1979), is based on childhood years spent at Taymouth Castle, with his
father appearing as the character Jim Lovat.
Fred Urquhart left school at 15 and worked as a bookseller's assistant and
labourer. His first novel, Time Will Knit, was published in 1938, and was
heavily influenced by Virginia Woolf. Urquhart used his fiction as a vehicle
for his pacifism, and like Norman MacCaig, became a conscientious objector in
the Second World War.
Detailed to do agricultural work, he went to the Laurencekirk area and turned
his experiences into classic dialect stories centred on his fictional town of
Auchencairn. Later he was to deny vigorously that he had been influenced by
Lewis Grassic Gibbon in his rural Scottish fiction.
At the war's end Urquhart went to London, and in the congenial pubs of
``Fitzrovia'' met writers and artists - notably James Kirkup, George Barker,
and Robert Colquhoun. His short stories, published in literary magazines, began
to appear in volumes with catchy titles, such as The Last GI Bride Wore Tartan.
George Orwell admired Urquhart's work and John Betjeman gave him fiction to
review.
Though he spent a large part of his life in the South, Urquhart remained a
Scottish writer - but with the eye of a realist, not that of the sentimental
exile. As he said: ``I put the Scots on paper as I see them. I don't think that
some of the stories are very popular in Scotland because the Scots don't want
to see themselves as others see them.''
Urquhart's fiction is distinguished by his masterful use of dialogue and by his
profound understanding of human nature with its humour as well as its sinister
aspects. Probably his greatest gift as a writer is his ability to tell
convincing stories through female characters, as in the two novels The Ferret
was Abraham's Daughter and Jezebel's Dust, about Bessie Hipkiss's escape from
an Edinburgh slum.
His thematic range encompasses present and past, from the ``emotional indecency
of contemporary life'' (Alan Bold's phrase) to historical fiction and
supernatural stories.
In 1947 Fred Urquhart met Peter Wyndham Allen, a former dancer, and they were
to live together for 43 years. Urquhart had a variety of occupations: literary
agent; a reader for MGM of novelettes that would never reach the light of the
screen; a reader and editor for Cassell the publisher, where he rejected
Flannery O'Connor.
The decline in the market for short stories in the post-war world forced him to
turn to reviewing, and to reading for other publishers. Despite these
difficulties he continued to develop his gifts, and his Collected Stories were
published to critical approval in the late 1960s.

A 19-YEAR-old airline baggage handler was accused of stealing the Duchess of
York's diamond necklace and bracelet yesterday, then was freed from a New York
court on #50,000 bail.
Gilbert Terrero's parents signed his release papers promising to pay should he
abscond.
He is believed to have admitted he was responsible.
``He had no idea of the enormity of what he was getting involved in,'' an FBI
spokesman said. ``He does now.''
The Duchess of York was last night overjoyed that her stolen jewels, a present
from the Queen, had been recovered, although the main piece of her necklace had
been broken up and five diamonds were missing. The FBI was confident they would
be recovered.
The necklace was recovered from a shed at the home of Terrero in Queen's, New
York. The stolen bracelet was earlier found in his locker at JFK airport.
He now faces the possibility of a 10-year prison sentence if found guilty of
theft from an inter-state shipment, a federal offence.
It emerged yesterday that the Duchess had personally carried the gems in her
hand baggage from Washington to New York in the first stage of a journey back
to London.
However, as she caught a Concorde flight to London she entrusted the jewels to
her dresser, Mrs Jane Dunne-Butler, who was catching a later British Airways
flight.
Mrs Dunne-Butler placed the jewels in her luggage, which was unlocked, before
it was loaded into the hold of her London bound aircraft.
The two other parts of the Queen's gift, diamond earrings and a ring, were not
stolen.
Mr James Hallstrom, assist-ant director of the FBI's New York operation, opened
a news conference by declaring: ``We have recovered the Crown Jewels.''
He added: ``All I can say about the offence at this stage is that the bags were
rifled. If it were me I would not put such valuable stuff in the hold.''
Terrero's family yesterday told of their shock at learning of the arrest.
They told how he came home on Monday afternoon with what appeared to be a
handful of ``trinkets''. He showed them to his mother and sister, asking:
``Look at these, do you think they're real?''
His sister looked through a store catalogue to compare them with pictures of
similar pieces, and concluded that at most they were worth ``300 bucks''.
He claimed to have found them while loading cargo into the plane.
The #250,000 jewels were reported missing on Monday evening. The subsequent
investigation involved security services on both sides of the Atlantic,
Scotland Yard, the New York Police Department, and British Airways own security
personnel.
During the investigation, a workmate of Terrerro pointed a finger in his
direction. His locker was searched and the bracelet was found.
The FBI was brought in and agents quickly surrounded his home. He gave
permission for a search without a warrant and the broken up necklace was
discovered in his shed.
A spokesman for the Duchess later described the decision to place the jewels in
the unlocked luggage as ``a mistake''.

Geoffrey Cameron, broadcasting executive; born February 5, 1941, died December
2, 1995
GEOFFREY Cameron was a civilised man. He entered the world of broadcast
journalism in Scotland when it was imperfectly understood; he helped it achieve
a respected maturity; and he has left it too soon.
Successive generations of producers and performers owe a debt of gratitude to
Geoff Cameron. He and the BBC grew up together, and those who worked with him
reaped the benefit of a founder's faith in his creations. In a career spanning
30 years of public-service broadcasting, he developed much of the core product
of what is now Radio Scotland, and was launching into the world of independent
production when he died. His name lives on with every transmission of Good
Morning, Scotland; Newsweek; and Eye to Eye.
Geoff arrived at BBC Scotland from newspapers. His first journalistic job was
with the Paisley Express, after leaving Hutchesons' Grammar School. From there,
he joined the Scottish Daily Mail - a background that matched the BBC's image
of the reporting talent the corporation was cautiously introducing to Scottish
living rooms. This was 1964; television worked in black and white; reporters
worked in TV and radio; contracts were issued for the ``Scottish Home Service''.
Geoff Cameron and his colleagues were pioneers - the electronics toolkit that
is ``the media'' was placed in their hands: what we watch and listen to each
day is of their devising.
Geoff chose to apply his talents to radio - an act of faith he never regretted,
despite the growing appeal of TV as the mass medium, with commensurate budgets.
As he pursued a career which culminated in his appointment as editor, current
affairs, Radio Scotland, his progress was marked by programmes distinguished by
their quality of language and intellectual rigour. This claim I make on his
behalf -Geoff was never presumptuous. Those who contributed to his output will
share a memory of unfailing courtesy, coupled with a scrupulous attention to
detail. Some will always be able to call to the mind's eye that patrician head
and jutting jaw shaking gently in polite dismay, as he intoned in the ear of an
errant presenter: ``No, no, no!'' - followed by an elaborate and embarrassed
apology. The technique always worked.
Geoff was a private man in an intensely public profession. But his family life
was rich, and he, Susan and their three children delighted in sharing their
pleasures with their friends.
It is typical of Geoff Cameron that he overcame illness to return to
broadcasting, apparently restored to fitness, indeed, with a raffish air. We
had looked forward, with him, to what he might achieve as an independent. He
was only 54.

THE sharp fall in industrial production in October was erratic. The warm
weather played havoc with demand for electricity and gas and drought conditions
impeded water output. North Sea gas fields also suffered.
The bulk of industrial output comes from the manufacturing sector, for which
specific figures are produced. Here production is barely increasing, and may
retreat as destocking gains momentum.
Revisions to earlier industrial production figures could result in third
quarter gross domestic product being revised up a touch, but would still leave
annualised growth at 2%, well below the Treasury's much questioned forecast of
3% next year.
The optimism among Kenneth Clarke's mandarins is largely dependent upon a
forecast of strong growth in consumer spending, which they are projecting will
increase by 3.5% next year. In the third quarter consumer spending rose by
0.7%. The public seem to be spending their money on almost anything except
shopping.
Evidence is now emerging that new car sales have picked up sharply in the last
two months. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders claims car
manufacturers' marketing drives are responsible. Cheap finance may have been
the greater catalyst.
There is nothing unusual about economies pausing for breath in mid-cycle. The
key question is whether interests rate should be cut at this stage. The
Americans were quick to do so in July and the current bull market on Wall
Street is largely a testimony to the belief that a soft landing has been
achieved. The Federal Reserve may have more rate cuts up its sleeve.
Here the Chancellor's 3% growth forecast has wrong-footed the pundits. Many are
arguing that its validation necessitates a cut in rates at next week's monetary
meeting. But Kenneth Clarke has denied that his number crunchers were relying
on rate cuts.
The contrary view is that Mr Clarke could hardly demand a cut in rates
immediately after projecting above trend growth next year. City opinion seems
to be moving away from its earlier view of an imminent rate cut, especially
since the Bundesbank stayed its hand last week. The building societies'
quarter-point off mortgage rates has taken some of the pressure off the
Chancellor.
But each piece of evidence that the economy is not living up to the
Chancellor's high hopes will add to the pressure for lower rates, but probably
not until the new year. Top economists reckon it will take at least two
half-point cuts, taking base rates down to 5.75%, to do the trick.
Boxing clever
DESPITE a strong profits performance, Carlton Communications' results have a
defensive air to them as well they might given the group's commitment to
traditional independent television networks.
There are those in the industry who believe the future lies with cable and
satellite and while terrestrial broadcasting is hardly going to fade away it is
a mature market. Carlton is already the largest commercial terrestrial
broadcaster and is unlikely to be allowed to expand further through adding a
third franchise.
Carlton's chairman Michael Green believes firmly that British television
viewers will continue to look to broadcast channels for most of their
entertainment and information for the foreseeable future. This may well be so,
though they will be under increasing pressure if Sky contues to snap up the
rights to leading sporting events. But the growth in the market is undoubtedly
going to come from cable and satellite. So while Carlton is doing well from
programme making it is not clear where the growth is going to come from.
One would think the video and film interests should be growth areas but if they
weren't in the past year they are unlikely to be in future. Video and sound
products is a good high-margin niche area and its future looks more secure.
Carlton's answer is to expand overseas, such as in the booming Asia-Pacific
region, but there seems to be no major deal on the horizon and many companies
want to muscle in there. Mr Green's track record suggests he will pull
something out of the hat to keep growth going but there must be some doubts
over the future, which are already reflected in the share rating of 15 times
historic earnings.
Under orders
WHAT price Ladbroke? Higher than they should be unless there is a bid from Bass
is one thought. The shares rose 2!sp to 160p on a fair turnover yesterday on
speculation that there would be a natural tie-up between the eponymous betting
side and the Bass Coral Racing subsidiary.
However, Coral has recently bought the 114 strong Arthur Prince slightly
up-market betting chain which would only muddy the waters.
More important why should Bass need more brand names with its Holiday Inns
growing at a tremendous rate. Putting this into context, Holiday Inns Worldwide
increased its exposure from 1925 to 2080 units last year and there are at least
500 coming into the group in the current year with already 487 having been
approved.
In contrast, the Ladbroke total of under 170 hotels is relatively insignificant
even if they are highly profitable in that their current financial year outturn
of perhaps about #160m is very much in line with the Holiday Inns result for
last year. Marrying the two profit systems together with franchise competing
with direct ownership raises major problems.
There is also the telling point that a Ladbroke purchase would be earnings
dilutive with its shares trading at around 18 times likely earnings compared
with the Bass ratio for the current year of under 15 times on the basis of
profits rising to #665m.
There are better bets in the market than Ladbroke.

LOYALIST Lindsay Robb and two Scottish followers were yesterday found guilty of
being part of a terror ring supplying guns to the outlawed UVF.
Robb, 28, was a leading figure in the Ulster peace talks with Northern Ireland
Minister Michael Ancram at Stormont earlier this year.
Robb, 28, of Mournview Avenue, Lurgan, Northern Ireland was found guilty at the
High Court in Glasgow. Also convicted of the conspiracy were John Johnston, 49,
of Campbell Crescent, Laurieston, Falkirk; and William McArthur, 41, of Ure
Crescent, Bonnybridge.
Three other men, Francis Hives, 45, of Liverpool; David White, 29, of Northburn
Avenue, Airdie; and Alexander Davidson, 23, of Lurgan, were cleared of the
conspiracy, but found guilty of lesser charges.
White was convicted of possessing two guns; Davidson of having two bullets; and
Hives of handing over two guns for terrorist use.
Lord Sutherland said he would sentence all six in Edinburgh on December 20.
During the 11-day trial, the jury heard how MI5 and Special Branch surveillance
experts targeted suspect terrorists as they devised the gun plot in Tam Bain's
public house in Laurieston, Falkirk.
The three Scots accused, Johnston, McArthur, and White, were followed by police
to a Liverpool bar, the Market Public House, where Hives was the tenant.
There they were handed a home-made machine pistol and a Hungarian-made Browning
type automatic.
The three were arrested on their way back, in an Airdrie suburb.
After officers wearing bullet proof vests ordered the three men from a car at
gunpoint they found a cardboard box in the vehicle, and, neatly wrapped up in
an orange shirt, guns for the loyalist cause.
The court heard that Davidson, the son of a Lothian Labour councillor, was
later caught with two bullets in his car as he got the ferry back to Ulster. He
told police Robb had given them to him in Tam Bain's.
MI5 officers and Special Branch detectives also pulled in Robb.
In public life, Robb was a leading figure in the Progressive Unionist Party.
Although involved earlier this year in peace talks, Robb was a suspected
terrorist Godfather at the head of a group, members of which were responsible
for some of the Province's most horrific loyalist outrages.
It was known that Robb was offered resettlement in Scotland by the RUC after he
gave evidence in an IRA murder trial. He was given #2000 and officially loaned
an automatic pistol with 25 rounds of ammunition for self-protection.
However Robb, who was involved with two Scottish women, did not settle in
Scotland. He did travel extensively throughout the country with the Craigavon
Protestant Boys' Flute Band, playing at various loyalist functions.
MI5 officers watched the comings and goings of Robb as he visited two Scottish
loyalist pubs, the Drumgelloch in Airdrie, locally nicknamed the Drum G, and
Tam Bain's.
Into their snare fell the accused.
MI5 officers who gave evidence for the first time in a Scottish court, their
identities covered by a screen, gave Johnston the code name Speaker's Choice
and McArthur, Bad News.
During the trial the court heard how loyalists raised cash for Ulster prisoners
and their families at so-called UVF dances in the Falkirk area, and were
thanked by UVF ``colour parties'' (two hooded men in full combat gear) for
their help in winning the ``bloody war''.

NEW Zealand rugby union chiefs yesterday named John Hart as the new All Blacks
coach after turning him down three times.
Hart will be New Zealand rugby's first professional coach, with a
performance-related salary package.
He had lost previous battles for the coaching spot against Alex Wyllie in 1988
and Laurie Mains in 1992 and 1994.
Mains guided the All Blacks to the final of the World Cup earlier this year,
where they lost to South Africa.
``The All Blacks are an icon, they are very important to New Zealand and I
think it's important that we maximise whatever we can do in terms of the All
Blacks and what they can do for New Zealand,'' Hart said.
Hart, who played 26 times for Auckland and twice for Taranaki in the 1960s and
70s, celebrated his fiftieth birthday yesterday.
He faces a daunting calendar of fixtures next year, with two tests against
Scotland, one against Western Samoa, two against Australia and five against
South Africa.

A PROGRAMME of hands-on help open to firms which are no longer start-ups but
have not yet the clout of major concerns is being mounted by Dunbartonshire
Enterprise.
It will take the form of two-day skills seminars at the Business Creation
Centre at Clydebank Business Park and will involve practical advice rather than
theory.
The Business Creation Centre is the only ``incubator'' for fledgling firms in
Scotland which provides under one roof, and initially free, office space,
computers, telephones, secretarial back-up, and business advice.
The first seminar starts tomorrow and continues on Monday. It will deal with
raising funding and will involve funders such as the Scottish Office Industry
Department, the Clydesdale Bank, and venture capital group 3i, as well as
companies with their own stories to tell.
According to Danny Cusick, business development executive at the centre, these
companies will be sharing their experiences warts and all.
Speakers at the first seminar will include Ian Steele of Rutherford, Manson &amp;
Dowds; Gillian Mason, business banking manager at the Clydesdale Bank; Ken
Beaty, investment controller at 3i, and Jim Allen of the innovation division at
the Scottish Office Industry Department.
The programme, which is free, will also tackle subjects such as markets and
marketing, selling techniques, financial management and cash flows, the law and
product protection, and VAT and business taxation.

NICHOLAS was in his final year studying sociology at Glasgow University when he
started ``hearing voices'', and writing to newspapers and embassies urging the
world to start a revolution.
It was the beginning of his long descent into mental illness, one from which he
did not emerge for nearly 10 years. During this period he made three suicide
attempts, underwent several spells of compulsory admission to mental hospitals,
and re-ceived electro-convulsive therapy.
Today Nicholas is leading a quiet, normal life, with his own flat in Glasgow's
West End, and taking part three days a week in a computer training programme.
He is also doing some voluntary work. Drug medication and a supportive circle
of family, friends and professional aid have helped him reintegrate into the
community. For Nicholas is one of the succcess stories of people discharged
from long-stay mental hospitals.
Meeting him in Shawpark Resource Centre, Maryhill, it's difficult to believe
that this soft-spoken man, now 37 years old, has been to hell and back. For
Nicholas is one of the country's schizophrenics, an illness little understood
by the public.
He will be among a group of 50 sufferers, between the ages of 18 and 40, taking
part in a year-long pilot project starting next month in Glasgow.
This innovative study, aimed at encouraging schizophrenics to take control over
their illness, is the idea of clinical psychologist Andrew Gumley and
psychiatric nurse David McCrae at Shawpark Resource Centre, in Glasgow's
Maryhill area.
It is based on a personal plan, a detailed booklet drawn up over a three-month
period by patients working in conjunction with a health professional. This
developed because the closure of long-stay mental hospitals and the switch to
``care in the community'' called for more effective ways of handling mental
illness. At the top of the agenda is the realisation that prevention is better
than emergency admission to hospitals.
The key is co-operation with the individual and those suffering from mental
illness are often loath to admit they have a problem. ``You have to work with
them when they are well,'' says McCrae. ``It's too late when they are in the
throes of a psychotic episode.''
The importance of taking medication is spelt out: 70% of those not taking it
will relapse within a year compared to 30% who stay with a regular drug regime.
McCrae says: ``We are trying to get them to control the illness by educating
them about it. An important step is getting them to identify the stress factors
in their lives, and what tactics they have developed for coping with it.
``Often they have never articulated the fact that they do have their own coping
mechanism - maybe it's going for a walk or talking it over with a member of
their family. Once identified, it's a matter of getting them to strengthen
these coping skills so that when they feel another episode starting they know
how to stop it before it becomes a major problem.''
Time and time again stress is mentioned as the trigger factor in a
schizophrenic episode: after losing a job, the end of a relationship,
bereavement or financial worries.
If the year-long project proves successful then personal plans will become
widely available, providing a tool to help sufferers cope with one of the most
crippling of mental disorders.

Kenneth S Goldstein, folklorist; born in Brooklyn, New York, March 17, 1927,
died in Philadelphia, November 11, 1995
FOLKLORE studies in Britain have, since the nineteenth century, owed a
tremendous amount to American scholars, and in this distinguished line the name
of Kenny Goldstein will certainly not be accounted the least.
Starting in the mid-fiftes as an enterprising record producer, he liaised with
folk singers on this side of the Atlantic such as Ewan MacColl and A.L Lloyd,
and through them he made contact with Scottish ballad singers such as the great
Jeannie Robertson.
This was at a time when the BBC and British record companies were largely
ignoring our native traditional song; consequently, his work in this field may
be said to have played an important part in the rapidly developing modern folk
revival.
In 1959 he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship, and was accepted by the School
of Scottish Studies of Edinburgh University as a field-worker; the school
directed him to the Aberdeenshire village of Fetterangus, where he was
introduced to the notable singing family of ``traveller'' Stewarts, and
particularly to the magnificent ballad singer Lucy Stewart, whom he made the
principal subject of his study.
Establishing himself with a hospitable family in Strichen, he shortly built up
a chain of useful informants, and during his year in Buchan he regularly sent
back valuable tapes of songs, stories, and local legends to Edinburgh.
Among the dozens of LPs which he masterminded, one outstanding one was Lucy
Stewart's Classical Ballads (Folkways SG3519). It includes superlative versions
of the Battle of Harlaw, Tifty's Annie (The Trumpeter of Fyvie), The Laird o'
Drum, The Bonny Hoose o' Airlie, and Barbary Allen.
Another favourite of my own is The Merry Muses of Caledonia, as sung by Ewan
MacColl. Kenny's notes to this fine LP are a real contribution to bawdy ballad
scholarship.
His experiences in the North-east provided a firm basis for his first
publication in book form, A Guide for Field Workers in Folklore, which appeared
in the States in 1964; it was for this work that he was awarded a PhD by the
University of Pennsylvania.
Although he took a keen interest in folklore researches in other parts of
Britain and Ireland, it was Scotland which captured his allegiance - indeed,
one might almost say his devotion - and in later years he returned many times
to Aberdeenshire.
Kenny's wife Rochelle - his staunch comrade in arms throughout his career -
survives him.

BUSINESS in Scotland should be asking pointed questions about how devolution
could affect it, the chairman of CBI Scotland, Mr Andrew Cubie, said yesterday.
Mr Cubie said that with political parties seeking to set out constitutional
conditions, business ``should be involved in issues of public policy, and
should be seeking the fullest information on the impact of proposals''.
Earlier, at a conference in Edinburgh, organised by Sybase and Gamut
Technologies, Mr Cubie said that new technology had to be embraced, otherwise
the prospects of business growth into the next century would be ``gloomy''.
``There must be an enthusiasm to embrace technological change,'' he said,
adding: ``I am positive that if we can, on a much wider basis, particularly
with small or medium-sized businesses, embrace quality and training, the future
augurs well.''
Mr Cubie said a competitive edge had to be achieved for businesses to survive
and flourish.
For that reason, he said, knowledge was essential.``Without knowledge, business
is stuck. Too many businesses look at their historic effort, but budgeting and
corporate systems are moving on.''
He recommended that there should be moves made in database planning,
recommending that those involved in venture capital should be encouraged by
innovative thinking.
A spokeswoman for Gamut said that despite heavy investment in computer
technology, many organisations were still unable to analyse their markets
effectively and quickly.
The new system of ``data warehousing'' was designed specifically for use by
senior executives and business users, allowing information on manufacturing
costs, market share, and customer opinion.

PEACE is a commodity which will not come cheaply in Bosnia this winter. In
financial terms, it will cost Nato an estimated #3 billion to police the
fragile cease-fire lines for a year. Goodwill and stability may be more
expensive still.
American involvement is the major political stake in the game. Facing a
re-election fight, President Clinton has committed 20,000 ground troops to an
international effort which is Nato-led but also involves Russian and other
non-aligned forces.
At one and the same time, it is Nato's and Clinton's finest hour. Nato is
fielding an army in a potential combat zone for the first time in its history.
The alliance may also have found a reason to believe in itself for the first
time since the end of the Cold War.
Clinton has decided to ante-up for the poker game of his career. He has
domestic budgetary problems which would become terminal to his chances of a
return to the White House if bodybags start coming back to smalltown America.
It is a supreme gamble.
Britain's contribution to the new force is largely in place. Most of its
8000-man contingent currently on call to the UN's Protection Force will simply
change berets and allegiance. They will be reinforced by tanks, heavy
artillery, helicopter gunships and the other paraphernalia of a combat division
numbering close to 13,000.
UK personnel will also comprise about 60% of the headquarters staff of the new
Nato Implementation Force (I-For) contingent in Sarajevo. The headquarters of
the 3rd UK Division will fly out to supervise the deployment of troops in
north-western Bosnia, Britain's assigned sector.
The French are to step up their current deployment of 6600 soldiers to 10,000
men, including naval, air force and support teams. France's territorial
responsibility will be Sector South, including the failed safe havens of
Sarajevo, Mostar, and Gorazde. French and Italian combat groups totalling 4000
men will serve under French command.
The US First Armoured Division, the spearhead of UN victory in the Gulf war,
will take responsibility for the rest of the shattered country. Historically,
2500 Russian troops will operate under its command, as well as German armoured
cavalry and mechanised infantry.
This single, beefed-up division will have almost as much firepower as the
entire British Army combined. Its striking power is awesome, with
multiple-launch rocket batteries, long-range artillery, strike helicopters and
the back-up of fighter-bombers based in Italy.
But it is also the most vulnerable part of the alliance. If the Bosnian Serbs
decide to become awkward, it is the Americans who must be the logical targets
for a guerrilla war which could scupper the entire effort.
Tanks and helicopters are the essential and impressive hi-tech tools of modern
war. In the wide-open spaces of the Saudi and Iraqi deserts, they reigned
supreme, killing targets at ranges in excess of two miles.
However, in the confined, mountainous hinterland of central Bosnia in winter,
their effectiveness could be reduced to the point where a handful of guerrilla
fighters hold the whip hand.
On paper, Nato is sending an unstoppable force against fragile and ill-armed
militiamen. It should be one-way traffic. In clear weather, it would be,
inevitably, a one-sided fight.
Life, is, as they say, not like that. The timing is wrong for the application
of what modern military strategists describe as ``surgical force''. Winter
weather will close down most of the options offered by air power. Despite
laser-guidance and ``smart'' weapons, pilots cannot hit what they cannot see.
The use of punitive and pinpoint-accurate artillery or missile strikes is also
limited by the field of vision. The ``collateral damage'' of civilian
casualties must be avoided at all costs.
As the UN's complex, contradictory and nonsensical rules of engagement are
scrapped overnight, Nato spokesmen say they will adopt a more robust system of
self-defence. Breaches of the cease-fire will be met with force. But it remains
a theoretical ideal.
If Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic decides to resist the imposition
of the US-brokered deal, his window of opportunity will open within the next
two months as Nato's closes with the coming of cloud cover.
Mladic, a manipulative and single-minded soldier, has anything up to 80,000 men
under arms. Most will follow him after four years of almost continuous victory.
Some will follow to avoid the possibility of trial as war criminals.
He is the architect of Greater Serbia, the conqueror of the Croat Krajina, the
man who shattered the myth of UN safe havens in Bosnia. He is undisputed master
of the Bosnian Serb army, but he is not entirely crazy.
Mladic knows that he can no longer depend on the vital aid of Serbia itself.
President Milosevic, his sponsor, can no longer afford to buck international
opinion. More to the point, Serbia cannot afford the reimposition of
international sanctions.
The general now has a limited timescale, coupled with a limited ammunition
stock, to make his own deal with the world. His options for giving Nato and the
US a bloody nose remain numerous. A guerrilla campaign in terrain which favours
the local insurgents is what the Pentagon fears most.
In an ideal world, US forces would simply wait out the winter, ride with the
blows, and respond in the clarity of spring skies with a decisive hand. In
reality, its commanders will be under strict orders to minimise casualties. War
for America is no longer a purely military phenomenon.
Even in a country like the former Yugoslavia, instant media communications
systems can bring every action into the living-rooms of hundreds of millions of
voters. Public perception, shaped by the Falklands and the Gulf, anticipates
short, low-loss conflict.
Clinton, like the Grand Old Duke of York, is about to march Nato to the top of
the hill. Marching it back down again may not be quite so simple.

FORMER internationalist Bobby Hill yesterday looked forward to his new role as
Scotland's chairman of selectors and admitted there is a lot of work to be
done. He was elected at the SCU's annual meeting in Perth, succeeding Hugh
Stevenson, who died in August.
The new chairman said: ``We've got one season to find the right blend for the
World Cup in Malaysia in 1997, so the players have everything to play for next
year. The door is open to anyone who can prove they're good enough to play for
Scotland.''
Financially the Union had a good year, with their income up by over #3200. The
net surplus compared with previous years advanced to #18,749.
Towards the close of the evening awards were made to George Strachan (West
Lothian County) as groundsman for the year and Edinburgh District as Area
champions, while the East and West Districts won the awards for the Under-19
and Under-16 District championships respectively.
Douglas Lockhard, winner of many awards this season, was the recipient of the
special award made by the President.

START-UP losses at Century Radio in Newcastle have been holding back profits at
Border Television.
Television advertising revenue grew by a healthy 12% during the six months to
October 31, but operating profits remained flat at #1.1m.
The Carlisle-based company said the second half of the financial year was
unlikely to bring much improvement.
Century Radio is expected to break even as it enters its second year of
operation, but Border, in common with other ITV stations, is suffering from
lower than expected pre-Christmas advertising revenue.
``It has slowed quite dramatically,'' said finance director Peter Brownlow,
noting it would be lucky to get the same advertising revenue for November as
last year.
Border chairman Melvyn Bragg was cautious about the company's prospects for the
second half. ``While some growth should be maintained, we expect it will be
marginally below that achieved during the first six months,'' he said.
Mr Bragg announced last week that he would step down as chairman at Easter
because of the pressure of other work, but he will stay on as a non-executive
director. A new chairman is being sought.
Although the latest results show no improvement at the operating level, pre-tax
profits rose to #1.1m from #849,000 in the first half of 1994, when they were
hit by an exceptional charge of #297,000. That related to start-up costs at
Century Radio and Scot FM in Edinburgh.
Border sold its 37% stake in Scot FM in May after disposing of a similar
minority stake in Lancaster's Bay Radio last year to pursue a new policy of
controlling radio stations outright.
It should hear the result of its recent application for a radio licence
covering Derby and Nottingham by the end of December. It also plans to apply
for the Yorkshire regional radio licence in February.
Mr Brownlow said Border would consider buying an existing station, but it was
not prepared to pay the high prices these commanded.
He said the company was also attracted by the idea of setting up a local cable
channel in northern England or southern Scotland, which could use its
headquarters in Carlisle as a base.
Border has accumulated #2.5m which it is under increasing pressure to invest.
Mr Brownlow said the board had discussed the idea of a share buy-back, but had
rejected it for the time being.
In the longer term, Border is worried it may fall prey to a takeover. Its main
fear is that the Government will ease restrictions on media ownership,
encouraging a round of bids.
That would leave it looking very vulnerable since its ITV franchise covering
North-west England and southern Scotland is one of the UK's smallest.
Mr Brownlow said Border was wary of its southern neighbour Granada Television,
with which it already shares an advertising sales operation.
If cross-media ownership rules were relaxed it might also become vulnerable to
groups such as Caledonian Publishing, the owner of the Herald and Evening
Times, he added.
Despite a 16% improvement in the interim dividend to 2.3p, Border shares were
unchanged at 217p.

R E DUNDAS
Chief Financial Editor
THE Indian summer hit output of the electricity, gas, and water utilities and
production in North Sea gas fields and was largely responsible for a sharp fall
in industrial production in October, according to the Central Statistical
Office.
But its main constituent, manufacturing output, edged ahead, despite signs of
destocking, after declining in September.
Separate figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed a
sharp pick-up in sales of new cars last month.
Overall, industrial production fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.9% in October,
much weaker than had been generally expected. The mild weather was blamed for a
drop of 3.9% in oil and gas extraction between September and October and a 6.4%
decline in the output of the onshore electricity, gas, and water industries.
Electricity, gas, and water output declined by 1.6% in the latest three months
and was 3.7% lower than in the same three months a year.
By contrast, mining and quarrying, which includes oil and gas extraction,
increased by 2.8% in the latest three months and was 3% higher than in the same
three months last year.
The annual rate of increase in industrial production fell back from 0.9% in
September to 0.5%. In the latest three months industrial production grew by
0.3% and was 0.8% higher than in the same three months a year ago.
Revisions to the figures for earlier months increased third quarter industrial
production by 0.2% above previous estimates and opened up the prospect of an
upward revision to the quarter's gross domestic product from 0.4% to 0.5%.
Manufacturing output, which accounts for 84% of industrial production, rose in
line with City forecasts by 0.2% in the month, taking the annual gain to 0.9%
from 0.7% in September. It was also 0.2% ahead in the latest three months
compared to the previous three and 1% higher than in the same three months a
year ago.
There were month-on-month increases in just over half of the manufacturing
industries, including textiles, up 0.6%, and engineering, up 0.8%.
Chemicals output fell by 0.4%, suggesting that the large build-up in stocks in
the sector is beginning to unwind.
Output of the food, drink, and tobacco industries fell by 1%.
In the latest three months, statistically a better guide to the underlying
trend, only engineering is showing a significant rise, 0.5% higher than in the
previous three months. Food, drink, and tobacco fell by 0.7% and textiles by
1.7%.
James Capel's Adam Cole said the underlying trend in manufacturing remained
little better than flat.
``With manufacturers' stocks up #1300m in the second and third quarters, an
imminent recovery in output is unlikely, even if final demand holds up well,''
he added.
``In our view this is exactly were the risks to the Chancellor's bullish 3%
growth forecast lie. However, with further evidence required that 3% is
unachievable, we remain of the view that base rates are more likely to fall
early next year than between now and Christmas.
q  At 143,055, new car registrations in November were 12.77% ahead of the same
month last year, but manufacturers said the increase reflected aggressive
marketing rather than a sudden return of the ``feel good'' factor. Cheap
finance is also readily available.
It was the second month running to show an increase and took total sales for
the first 11 months of the year to 1,873,826 from 1,837,696 in the
corresponding period in 1994 - a gain of 1.97%.
The figures lent credence to the Treasury's view that consumer spending, which
rose by 0.7% in the third quarter, remains strong.
However, SMMT chief executive Ernie Thompson said: ``Although, at first sight,
these figures are encouraging, they largely result from aggressive marketing
initiatives by individual manufacturers to stimulate demand, rather than from a
sudden return of the `feel good' factor following the Budget.''
November's best-selling cars were:
1 Ford Fiesta 13,229.
2 Ford Escort 8,324.
3 Rover 400 7,818
4 Vauxhall Astra7,222
5 Ford Mondeo 6,742.
6 Vauxhall Corsa 5,704
7 Rover 200 5,195
8 Rover 100 4,729
9 Vauxhall Vectra 4,393
10 Peugeot 306 3,623.

RANK Organisation's operating profits in the 12 months to early November rose
by 11% to #250m, the leisure group reported in a trading update.
Rank noted that the National Lottery had absorbed about all the real increase
in leisure spending and had hit its bingo operations hard.
As a result recreation division profits were down about a quarter in the year
to early November. Smaller clubs are being shut and resources concentrated on
larger units which have been little affected.
Chief executive Michael Gifford declared that the outlook for trading
conditions in 1996 ``appears more favourable for the group's businesses than at
any time since 1990.''
The other divisions have moved ahead, notably leisure, whose profits advanced
40%. Nightclub admissions were 13% ahead after new openings and spend per head
up 5%. Hard Rock cafe also opened new branches in the US.
Film and television saw a 20% advance on the back of higher volumes in photo
processing and better margins. Odeon cinemas benefited from margin improvement
and Pinewood studios had a good year. Holidays were 10% ahead.
Rank Xerox's underlying profits improved but Rank's contribution declined as a
result of the reduction in Rank's stake.
This pushed down overall pre-tax profits for the group from #376m to #360m.
Rank shares gained 16p to 425p on the statement.

THREE land sales worth a possible #1m should provide a food park with the
recipe for growth. For the last couple of years Motherwell Food Park has been
shoved onto the back burner by the bubbling success of the adjacent Strathclyde
Business Park and nearby enterprise zone sites, but owners Caledonian Land have
shown that the park can still attract inward investors and find a new role for
itself.
In the largest deal, a 4.9-acre site was sold to dairy product producers Robert
Wiseman &amp; Sons Ltd for #375,000. Catering firm Brake Brothers Foodservice Ltd
bought a 3.7-acre site for #360,000. A 2.6-acre site was sold to Man Truck &amp;
Bus (UK) Ltd at an undisclosed price.
However, the average selling price for development land in the other two deals
was #87,000 per acre which, if achieved in the Man Truck deal, would mean a
total price of more than #960,000 for the three sites. Only one vacant plot
remains unsold at the park and letting agents Richard Ellis and J Trevor
Webster are in discussion with a potential purchaser.
Recognising that the park is also home to non-food companies, Caledonian Land
has decided to `re-brand' the industrial estate. From now on it will be known
as Motherwell Food and Technology Park.
Glasgow is responding to the challenge from Lanarkshire by offering specialist
foodpark facilities closer to the city centre. The #12m M8 Foodpark at Port
Dundas has attracted Ambassador Frozen Foods and Dark Island (both part of the
Ambassador Group).
The companies specialise in frozen foods for the catering industry and
currently occupy outmoded premises at Port Dundas. The move into purpose-built
facilities will alow for expansion. When complete the M8 Foodpark, which is
being developed by Glasgow Development Agency and the private sector, will
provide some 140,000 sq ft of modern industrial units designed specifically for
food processors. The scheme is the second initiative aimed specifically at the
food manufacturing industry in Glasgow.
The Glasgow East Foodpark at Cambuslang has already attracted a number of
occupiers, including Carousel Wafers and Joseph Dunn Group.

PROMINENT Scots businessmen are expected to demand today that CBI Scotland
drops its neutral course on devolution and declares outright opposition to a
Scottish parliament.
There has been increasing disillusionment among CBI members, who fear business
interests are not best served by the organisation's failure to become involved
in the political debate over constitutional change.
It is also understood that a number of leading companies are considering the
withdrawal of annual subscriptions unless perceived support for Labour is
abandoned.
The Confederation of British Industry's 52-strong Scottish Council, elected by
the grassroots membership, is likely to be urged today at its private meeting
in Glasgow to:
q Oppose the promised Labour-Liberal Democrat parliament with tax raising
powers, and:
q Prepare a list of questions about devolution for Labour leader Tony Blair,
who visits Scotland tomorrow.
One source said: ``A number of prominent Scottish businessmen are very angry,
to say the least, over the bland, neutral stance adopted by an organisation
which is supposed to represent their interests.
``They plan to condemn the timid and weak approach to devolution, and insist
that CBI Scotland comes out strongly against what is on the table in terms of a
Scottish parliament.
``They also want concerns that a Scottish parliament would damage business to
be addressed by Tony Blair, and are preparing a series of questions they
believe he will be unable or unwilling to respond to.''
In August, new chairman Andrew Cubie said he planned to steer a neutral course
on devolution. ``We will involve ourselves in the public policy discussions,
but not in the party political discussions''.
Mr Cubie, a senior partner with an Edinburgh law firm, said the CBI would not
adopt an attitude for or against devolution.
However, the source said the CBI ``must, for businesses' sake, listen, agree a
line, and not just hide behind its apolitical stance. We want strong leadership
on the issues arising from constitutional change.''
Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch recently called on business leaders to
speak up for the Union to protect growth in manufacturing and record breaking
exports. Newspaper surveys have also claimed that up to 15 leading companies
would ``quit Scotland'' if the Scottish parliament came to pass.
It is well known that some of Scotland's top businesses and CBI Scottish
Council members, including the Weir Group and Scottish and Newcastle, are
opposed to a tax-raising assembly.
CBI director Iain McMillan said last night he was not aware of any move to
reach a formal decision on devolution.
He denied the organisation was ``sitting on the fence'', arguing that it had
said all along that devolution was a constitutional and political matter to be
decided by individual companies, and through the ballot box.
He was also unaware that any Scottish company was considering holding back on
subscriptions, which vary from a few hundred to thousands of pounds.
Lord Goold, chairman of the McTaggart and Mickel building group, and former
Scottish Conservative Party chairman, was equally unaware of today's planned
protests. However, he said: ``I am not happy with the CBI's neutral stance on
devolution as proposed by the Labour Party.''
Lord Goold confirmed that his firm's subscription notice, normally paid
automatically, had been passed to the board for a decision on whether to pay.
He said: ``I know some other firms have done the same''.

SCOTTISH Metropolitan Property sees no upturn in the depressed UK property
market next year, but is confident that it will continue to thrive.
``We are in a strong position to take advantage of investment acquisition
opportunities,'' chairman David Walton told the company's annual meeting.
More than two thirds of ScotMet's property portfolio is in Scotland, where
property values have fared rather better than in England.
Mr Walton said the company had acquired #50m of new properties in Scotland and
the north of England since the spring, now some 20% of its portfolio.
Pre-tax profits, excluding gains and losses on asset sales, jumped 50.6% to
#8.7m in the year to August 15.

SCOTLAND'S retail, office, and industrial sectors continue to mark time,
according to the Richard Ellis Scottish Monthly Index which is produced
exclusively for the Herald.
Capital growth in the office sector went down by 0.2% in November, producing an
annual growth rate of 0.7%. Retail capital growth stood still during November,
but over the year is some 3.2% higher than 12 months ago. Capital growth in
industrials went up by 0.1% in November, helping to maintain an annual capital
growth rate of 1.0%. Taken together, the three sectors are seeing an annual all
property capital growth rate of 1.6%.
Office rentals went down by 0.2% over the month, returning to similar levels of
a year ago. Retail rentals also stood still, marking some six months of nil
rental growth on Scotland's high streets - although rentals are some 1.2%
higher than they were one year ago. Nor was there any growth in industrial
rents during November. Annual rental growth on the industrial estates is firmly
shuttered up at 0.7%.
Total annual returns in the office and industrial sectors stand at 8.7% and
10.2% respectively, while retail's total annual returns have shaded down from
9.5% to 9.3%. There have been no changes in the average initial yield and
equivalent yields stand at 7.5% and 7.6% respectively, showing no changes in
either figure since July.

SOFT-DRUG offenders in the Highlands will avoid prosecution if they undergo
rehabilitation.
People caught with soft drugs - such as amphetamine and cannabis - will be
offered the option of a six-month course of treatment.
The scheme - launched in Ross-shire this week - is a first for Scotland and
will be extended to Inverness and the rest of the Highlands if successful.
However, procurator-fiscal at Dingwall, Mr David Hingston, insisted the fight
against drug dealers and hard-drug users - who will not be offered the course -
would continue.
Mr Hugh MacMillan, Northern Constabulary's chief constable, welcomed the move
yesterday. He said: ``This is a sensible way of dealing with minor offenders
and every opportunity should be given to assist in rehabilitation.''
Mr Hingston - who now has the power to divert offenders to the Highland
region-run training programme - denied it was a soft option for offenders.
``At this stage, it is primarily, though not exclusively, for first-time
offenders. Those undertaking the programme will have quite some commitment to
make,'' he said.
Mr Hingston added: ``I'm not going soft on drugs - I see it as one possible way
of breaking a habit.
``If they complete the course successfully and commit no further offences,
there will be no conviction for the offence. If they fail to co-operate
properly, I retain the right to prosecute and that person will instantly be
back in court.''
Mr Hingston stressed: ``I'm not prepared to contemplate involving those caught
in possession of Class A drugs like heroin, ecstasy or cannabis oil, nor will
this be offered to people dealing in drugs of any kind.''
The scheme was approved by the Scottish Office after a report by a ministerial
task force under Lord Fraser of Carmyllie. Highland region's social work
department has earmarked cash for the project which will initially deal with
about 20 offenders.
The pilot project will be purely educational and office-based, involving
90-minute group or one-to-one discussions on drug abuse.

FOR so long the Cinderella district of Scottish rugby, the North and Midlands
are suddenly having a ball. Last month they dumped the touring Western Samoans,
last night they crushed Glasgow at Beveridge Park, Kirkcaldy - their
biggest-ever win against the city.
The home side ran in eight tries, making light of the Arctic conditions which
included a biting wind and showers of hail. Kenny Harper was an outstanding
scrum half, Rowen Shepherd showed his class at full back and John Kerr's direct
running was a delight.
Even without injured Scotland skipper Rob Wainwright, the North back row
covered the park like a rug. Martin Waite, the Edinburgh Academical flanker,
grabbed two of the tries, David McIvor was an inspirational skipper, and Gareth
Flockhart underlined his promise.
There was not a lot that could be said in Glasgow's favour. Cammy Little
battled bravely at scrum-half but they certainly missed the injured Stirling
trio, Kenny Logan, Ian Jardine, and Kevin McKenzie.
A sizzling Harper break carried on by Flockhart sent Waite to the line for the
opening score. Shepherd converted.
After 16 minutes Calum MacGregor put a penalty goal over for the visitors but
it was short-lived relief.
Mark McKenzie popped up a pass to Flockhart who went over like a plough through
snow. Shepherd converted.
There was a short scare when two sets of lights went out but a Simon Burns try
brightened up the home fans.
MacGregor kicked his second goal yet the flags had barely come down before
Waite crashed through phantom tacklers and Shepherd converted to make it 26-6
at the break.
George Breckenridge, on for Angus Turner, hinted at a Glasgow revival with a
try in the corner.
It was a false dawn.
Kerr, looking as sharp as the frost, hurtled through a gap and Shepherd goaled.
The full back decided to bag a try for himself, rumbling in from all of 50
metres.
A long Harper break gave Burns his second touchdown which Shepherd again
converted.
The last home try was from Alex Carruthers. Little was rewarded for all his
efforts with a consolation try which MacGregor converted. The North and
Midlands were determined to have the last kick and local lad John Mitchell,
another of the replacements, popped over a dropped goal.

Catering for all tastes
LA Cage is an exciting restaurant which has very recently opened up in what
used to be The Crannog eatery, which will be remembered by some discerning
Glasgow diners.
Glasgow catering firm Premiere Cuisine Limited has taken over the complex at
Cheapside Street which includes two complementary establishments, Madame
Gillespie's Cabaret Bar and Madame Gillespie's Night Club, and they have spared
no expense in getting things right in terms of comfort, decor and general
ambience.
Although La Cage is a gay restaurant - believed to be Glasgow's first - manager
Kevin Slaven assures me that being straight is definitely not a problem, and
there's a warm welcome for everyone, straight or gay.
La Cage offers a seductive menu, European in style with the accent on local
Scottish produce, in comfortable, not to say sumptuous surroundings. The theme
is classical, you could say, with more than a touch of the Romanesque. Gilded
mirrors and classical urns and reliefs form a pleasing backdrop to the charming
intimate tables and comfortable cane seats.
The Chef has prepared a mouthwatering menu to tempt the most jaded of palates.
Tantalising starters include Filo Basket of Lobster and Scallops, flavoured
with light lobster and herb fumet, finished with cognac, or Oban Mussels,
flavoured with young garlic and finished with cream, but Warm Salad of Smoked
Duck with crisp seasonal leaves and a light soya and ginger dressing, or
Terrine of Wild Mushrooms and Chicken are equally enticing.
While Scottish seafood, lamb and venison form the backbone of the menu,
vegetarians need not be concerned as there are several savoury dishes just for
them, and puddings are deliciously wicked. Prices are agreeably reasonable too,
music is camp with variations, and a meal at La Cage can be rounded off - by
those with stamina - with a late-night session at next door's Madame
Gillespie's Night Club.
Cheapside Street is quiet and off the beaten track but surprisingly close to
the city centre and Glasgow's major hotels.
La Cage is offering a tasty Christmas menu which will cater for all tastes, not
least those who like to eat simple, straightforward, carefully cooked food
without pretensions. The Christmas menu aims to be easy on your pocket and
offers excellent value for money. La Cage's friendly staff look forward to
seeing you from 6pm until 11pm (last orders) every day of the week.

THE Government is understood to be reconsidering its ban on allowing British
Rail to bid for some of the later rail franchises, including ScotRail and the
West Coast Main Line.
The about-turn is designed to salvage its struggling rail privatisation
programme but would highlight the fact there is little genuine outside interest
being shown in the rail franchises, most of which look set to be the subject of
management buy-outs anyway.
Contracts for the first three are due to be signed next week.
They are Great Western Railway, operating out of Paddington, South West Trains
(Waterloo), and London, Tilbury, and Southend (Fenchurch St). At least two will
go to management buy-outs, although Perth-based bus operator Stagecoach may
have undercut South West management by proposing reduced service levels.
These tenders could all have to be renegotiated, however, if the Save Our
Railways pressure group is successful with an application for a judicial review
to be held in the High Court today.
British Rail management has been annoyed at being prevented from bidding for
the franchises so far put out to tender, which include a second tranche headed
by InterCity East Coast.
Its management is mounting a strong bid, as is London and Continental Railways,
a consortium including Richard Branson's Virgin Group. This consortium is also
bidding to build and operate the Channel Tunnel rail link and is keen to bid
for the West Coast Main Line franchise when that is eventually put out to
tender.
Virgin has visions of linking up the West Coast Main Line and the Cross Channel
Rail Link.
Meanwhile, if Save Our Railways is successful at the High Court hearing, the
franchising process would be set back to square one, which must involve weeks
if not months of delay.

GLASGOW-based Weir Group has landed an order worth #5m to supply water
injection pumps to the Norwegian Draugen field in the Norwegian part of the
North Sea for A/S Norkse Shell. The order is the largest placed with Weir from
the Norwegian sector.
Weir supplies about #100m in oil and gas production supplies throughout the
world each year. The new equipment, which will be manufacturered mainly at Weir
Pumps' facility in Glasgow, is part of a Norske Shell upgrade programme and
will increase oil flow capacity at the site by 45%.
To sell or
not to sell
THE shareholders of Littlewoods, Britain's largest family-owned business meet
today to discuss whether to sell the retail and football pools empire that has
been in the Moores family for three generations. Founder John Moores died two
years ago.
Boardroom battles, competition from the National Lottery and the recession have
depressed earnings and the firm has warned that this year's profits will be
``some way below'' last year's levels. The business has received two bids, one
from a former chief executive Barry Dale and more recently a joint one from
frozen food retailer Iceland and mail order group N Brown. The bids value the
company at around #1200m.
Boots agrees
Croda sale
BOOTS, the pharmacist and retailer, has agreed to buy the European cosmetics
and toiletries business of speciality chemicals firm Croda International for an
undisclosed sum. The acquired operations had net assets at the end of 1994 of
#5.7m.
Scot secures
retail post
SCOT Eddie Thompson has been elected to the management committee and council of
the British Retail Consortium.
Mr Thompson, executive chairman of the Dundee-based Morning Noon &amp; Night
convenience stores chain, will look after the interests of Scotland's 3000
independent food retailers as the Scottish Grocers' Federation's representative.
US order for

<HEADLINE>There was not much to set the nerves tingling Exiles' win but rugby loses out at Richmond</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975011949</RECORDNO>

THE Exiles got their championship defence rolling with a win but, as a showcase
for the future of the game, this metropolitan chiller left almost everything to
be desired.
Richmond last night had less atmosphere than the moon and it was almost as
cold. Snow flurries provided a seasonal setting but there the Christmas spirit
ended.
At a time when the Scottish Rugby Union is determined to advance the cause of
district rugby, it is difficult not to feel sympathy for the players, whose
international futures are on the line, when they are expected to raise the pace
and tempo of their game when that other major element of top-flight rugby - a
vociferous and aggressive crowd - are conspicuous by their absence.
The Scottish coach David Johnston and selector Colin Fisher, plus A team
manager Douglas Morgan, were in attendance but it would be harsh on players to
base any kind of meaningful judgement on such a desultory display.
Until virtually the last minute of the game, it was devoid of tries and mostly
even of the threat of tries.
The six penalty goals, four from the Exiles' fly-half Stuart Laing and a couple
from his Edinburgh counterpart Ally Donaldson, represented the only points on
the board until Exiles winger Graham Smith had a try in the seventy-eighth
minute.
One player, though, who will feel especially comfortable with his performance
last night is the young Edinburgh Academicals' lock Scott Murray. The
19-year-old - who has already been labelled the best lineout jumer, bar none,
in Scotland by Edinburgh coach Ian Barnes - performed like a jack-in-the-box at
the lineout.
He is so marvellously spring-heeled that his style puts one in mind of the All
Black Ian Jones. At 6ft 6ins, he was conceding a couple of inches to the
Cardiff lock Keith Stewart but, as many a lineout man has discovered before,
size isn't everything.
Edinburgh suffered from a lack of guile and purpose at stand-off, Ally
Donaldson having a decidedly off night, being caught on numerous occasions
behind the gain line and behind his forwards.
There was little action to speak of until the twenty-ninth minute when Stuart
Laing kicked Exiles into the lead with a penalty goal.
Three minutes later Donaldson equalised for Edinburgh with a penalty of his own
but two minutes after that Exiles were back in front with Laing's second
successful penalty attempt.
It sounds fast and furious. It wasn't. Laing's third penalty goal came just on
half time and Exiles went into the second half 9-3 ahead.
After the interval, Laing, Craig, and Aaron James - a New Zealander of Scottish
descent of whom the Exiles expect much in the future - took play deep into
Edinburgh territory but a huge hit by Scott Hastings put paid to that.
Inevitably, though, the penalty was conceded and Laing speared the ball home.
Donaldson failed with a penalty effort of his own before Graham Dall drove
lineout ball and the Exiles were caught offside. With 14 minutes remaining,
Donaldson kicked the penalty goal and the match was still anybody's for the
taking.
Laing hit the post with yet another penalty attempt and Graham Smith was almost
over for a try from the rebound but he was dispossessed and Hastings cleared
the danger.
Two minutes from the end saw the only try of the game. It came from Smith after
Donaldson had muddled and guddled at a ball on his own 22 when it chiefly
required to be put convincingly to touch.
SRU director of rugby Jim Telfer is determined that districts are the way ahead
for the Scottish game. He has a point, but on the evidence of last night, when
admittedly the elements were not playing ball, it is difficult to advance much
of a case beyond saying that if you put 30 of the country's better players on
the park at one time then they might be exposed to a generally higher standard.

BASS is fuelled up to create 4000 jobs throughout Britain in its retail
operations, chairman Sir Ian Prosser said yesterday. Several hundred will be in
Scotland although the precise numbers are not yet available.
Sir Ian was speaking after Britain's second-largest brewer had unveiled
full-year results ahead of market expectations with pre-tax profits rising
11.3% to #599m.
He refused to comment on the rumoured acquisition of Ladbroke which has been
based upon the strength of the balance sheet with gearing just 23% .
The best outcome came from Bass Taverns which raised profits by a sixth to
#180m.
While beer volumes in the full year fell slightly, the recovery seen in the
summer pushed increasing amounts through the larger houses.
Food sales also expanded substantially even if there was a deal of price
promotion which ate into margins.
The hot summer benefited brewing profits by about #5m. Volume was ahead by 0.9%.
Bass has about a 23% market share compared with the 30% of Scottish Courage.
Margins in the off-trade fell but were compensated for by higher throughput in
the supermarket sector.
Britvic soft drinks saw sales rise almost a fifth but margins were under
pressure thanks to the pressures from supermarket own-label products which
vitiated the benefits of the near 10% volume growth.
The overall improvement in beer and pub trading was seen in the south of
England much more so than further north - as already indicated earlier this
week by Scottish &amp; Newastle.
However, Bass is probably taking most pleasure from the performance of the
Holiday Inns division where operating profits improved 9.3% on a 52 week basis
to #64m.
Leisure saw Gala bingo hit by the scratchcard phenomenon while Coral Racing was
helped by the spread of the ``blue'' or upgraded shops which have a higher
turnover although Coral appears to be less generous to the punter than its main
competitors.
The dividend total has been raised 7.6% to 22.7p with a 15.6p final.
Bass shares rose 26p to 695p for a 4.1% yield.

<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS of Berisford are being rewarded with a dramatically increased
dividend payout after the group moved back into the black.
The acquisition of kitchens and joinery group Magnet and Welbilt of the US,
which makes a variety of commercial cooking equipment, helped the group back
into profit in the year to September 30 with pre-tax earnings of #26.9m against
a #3.2m loss in the previous 12 months.
Chairman John Sclater expressed his confidence that the group would enjoy
further strong progress in the current year. Investors will see their payout
jump from 0.5p per share to 3p on earnings per share of 14p against a previous
loss of 2.1p.
Mr Sclater was reserved in his praise for Magnet, which he said had done
creditably in a difficult market.
Magnet's sales amounted to #185m, a 6% increase.
Cost reductions had played a major part in the division's performance, said Mr
Sclater, who emphasised its trading position next year depended on the housing
market.
The group boosted its cash pile by #57.1m to #111.3m and Mr Sclater emphasised
that while its immediate task was to develop existing businesses, its cash
resources meant it could hunt for further acquisitions.

MY good friend Struan Stevenson, whom I hope to see installed as the next MP
for Dumfries, took me to lunch the other day and we listened to the words of Mr
Poul Schluter, a former Prime Minister of Denmark and currently a
vice-president of the European Parliament. He spoke, made jokes, and answered
questions in English which, as Mickey Hirst observed, should be a lesson to us
all.
The ex-Premier reminded his audience that the Danes had two referendums before
agreeing to join the Union. ``We did not get it right the first time!'' He was
grateful for the help of Sir Edward Heath during the run-up to the second
ballot.
Mr Schluter obviously had another of our Prime Ministers, Sir Winston
Churchill, as one of his heroes and he came up with a story that I had not
heard before. At a ball given by the King and Queen in Buckingham Palace,
Ernest Bevin, then the Foreign Secretary, was seen to be taking the floor.
``Look, Mr Churchill,'' instructed a companion of Winnie's, ``Mr Bevin is
dancing.''
``No,'' came the growl in reply, ``it is just him doing the Labour movement.''
I don't know any jokes about Danish leaders.
Mr Schluter did not have unstinting praise for the European institutions. ``I
do not believe they work as well as they should - nevertheless, with 15 nations
and 11 languages it is perhaps a miracle that the Union works at all. Yet it is
comforting to reflect that three of the member states - Greece, Portugal, and
Spain - were until comparatively recently military dictatorships and now have
democratic constitutions and that another 10-15 former communist-controlled
countries are lining up to join.''
He had, however, a warning for all of us in Europe. ``We must not allow others
to exploit our inventions. The EU, for understandable reasons, has invested
much of its wealth into agriculture; the rest of the world, and in particular
the Far East, has gone for new technology.
``I do not think it is insignificant that Swissair has sited its ticket-issuing
office in India. We must learn to create new industries in Europe, we must
modernise and reconstruct or we will be the losers.''
The Danish statesman was not slow to criticise some of the actions of his
European colleagues. ``I think it is quite ridiculous, for instance, that every
member state spends money on urging people to stop smoking when, at the same
time, the EU pays out one billion Ecus every year to the tobacco industry.''
Yes, he agreed, it was ludicrous that there should be Parliaments in both
Brussels and Strasbourg.
The problem was, he confessed, that long before his country, or indeed ours,
had become members a treaty had been signed with the French guaranteeing them
an Assembly. Perhaps majority voting might end this farce?
The evil Ecu having been raised, this being a largely Tory audience, the way
was clear for someone to ask about a common currency. Mr Schluter did not
flinch: ``I favour it, but every country must have the right to make up its own
mind.
``You know the currency does not have to look the same throughout the Union. If
you want to keep the Queen's head on the notes, and we might want to as well,
why should there be any difficulty?
``But I will tell you this: America would never have become the industrial
giant that it has with 15 different currencies.
``Having said that I am not campaigning for a federal Europe. Most people find
the European Parliament far less interesting than their own national
legislature and that is how it should be.
``In 10 or 15 years' time the Union will have enlarged but it will still be
made up of independent nations, free to pursue their own policies. I just hope
we are all ready for the challenge of the next decade.
``My country is small but being in the EU gives us influence. It has been my
experience that if you can mount good arguments you always have a chance of
winning.''
He was a very civilised chap, just the dish to set before the sceptics who are
so afraid of losing their wee bit of sovereignty. Indeed, as I came away I said
to another friend that it might be no bad thing if politicians were
transferable, rather like football players.
President Clinton, it seemed to me, performed with much more elan in Belfast
and Dublin than he ever has in middle America. Mrs Thatcher was practically a
saint in the States and John Major is probably a huge hit in Bangladesh.
Could they not all be sent, even for a short spell, where someone actually
wants them?
What is it you need in Mother Russia? Someone to tackle organised crime, rid
the country of the Mafia? Got the very chap for you - tough on crime, tough on
the causes of crime. Requires a different kind of school for his kid but
otherwise easily satisfied as long as he has everything his own way.
Psst - want a penny off income tax in Thailand? We have this Chancellor
chappie, likes a wet and the odd puff, but can he cook the books . . .
Strikes? You are having a lot of public sector strikes in France? Yeah, we used
to have them so we will send you the grand Mr Heseltine who can scatter a
picket line at 20 paces. And he will sell your trains to caring capitalists.
Now - what am I bid for Dennis Skinner? Good for a laugh, does a turn at
question time each week, always wears the same clothes. Tell you what, you can
have him in a free transfer, he does not quite fit in with New Labour.

KINGFISHER, whose trading formats include B&amp;Q, Woolworths and Comet, increased
its sales by 4.8% in the 13 weeks to October 28. All its principal businesses
are said to have contributed to the rise.
The prolonged hot summer hit sales in Woolworths but business recovered in
September and October. B&amp;Q grew its sales in what remains a difficult DIY
sector and its market share rose. The Warehouse formats, with their more
extensive product ranges, continued to out-perform the B&amp;Q Supercentres.
Market share and sales also improved in the loss-making Comet electricals
business. The introduction of multi-media PCs into 95 stores by the end of
October boosted sales. The performance of Darty, its French electricals
business, was basically static.
Superdrug's strategic move away from household and food to health and beauty is
paying off in terms of increased sales.
Despite the good news Kingfisher shares fell 7p to 508p.

WHAT have O J Simpson and New Labour got in common? No convictions. One of many
jokes ridiculing New Labour's propensity for abandoning principles, at the drop
of a hat. Mind you, conviction politics has connotations of fanaticism, a touch
of the Margaret Thatchers. Conviction politicians, rattling out certitudes, rat
tat tat, like a Gatling gun and stamping all over our sensibilities in their
mental tackety jackboots, are not a pretty sight. Stick to principles, I
implore, instead of convictions, and you won't go far wrong.
Without principles you are un-principled. You can live without principles,
slugs and worms do it all the time, but it isn't a life for the Homo sapien,
whom God and nature decreed should walk upright. Principles can change, and if
it's an honest change then you're none the worse for it; you might even be
better. But to change or drop principles in the pursuit of power, corrupts. Let
me give you two examples from the history of the British Labour movement.
In 1951 Nye Bevan resigned from the Labour Government because Hugh Gaitskell,
then Chancellor of the Exchequer, was proposing to make patients pay for
medical services that had previously been free. The proposed charges were
minimal. One shilling (five pence in current coinage) per prescription. Today
it's #5.25 per item.
Bevan believed these charges were an abandonment of a profoundly important
principle. Fellow Labour MPs accused him of trawling up trivialities.
In his resignation speech to the House of Commons, Nye gave them a most
appropriate history lesson. ``I remember the triviality that started an
avalanche in 1931. I remember it very well, and perhaps my honourable friends
would not mind my recording it. There was a trade union group meeting upstairs.
I was a member of it and went along - the first subject was an attack on
seasonal workers. That was the first order. I opposed it bitterly, and when I
came out of the room my good old friend George Lansbury attacked me for
attacking the order. I said, `George, you do not realise this is the beginning
of the end. Once you start this there is no logical stopping point'.'' Nor was
there.
In 1929 a Labour Government was elected. Ramsay MacDonald became Prime
Minister. His Government, loyally toeing the Treasury line, was trying to
resolve the economic difficulties of the global market economy by exacting more
sacrifices from the poor. They started betraying one principle, and then
another, till the cupboard was bare.
With no principles of his own, MacDonald and other members of his Cabinet were
drawn inexorably into an alliance with the right wing of the Conservative
Party. New Labour, old Toryism, joined a coalition government which made
immediate and savage attacks on relief benefits for the unemployed and their
families.
By the late thirties, according to John Boyd Orr, more than one-third of
Scotland's population was suffering from malnutrition; many starving to death.
Rickets was rife. TB and other killer diseases stalked our land. It was the
slaughter of the innocent. Scotland became a killing field for babes in arms,
with the highest recorded infant mortality rate in Europe. Three of the
slaughtered innocents were my sisters, a factor which shaped my entire outlook
on life.
Twenty years later Bevan was again warning of the consequences of abandoning
principle. Let Labour impose charges for the first time within the health
service ``and there will be no logical stopping point''. Nor has there been.
Henceforth there would be no moral argument about a free health service, that
principle had been surrendered in Gaitskell's Budget. The debate in future
could only be about the severity of charges. When proposed by a Tory government
Labour protests are drowned by Tory cries of ``you started it. You first
brought in charges.'' I heard it again this year in a televised parliamentary
debate.
At some stage the NHS edifice will collapse. We will have a well-equipped and
funded private health service for the rich, and a tenth-rate underfunded public
health service for the poor.
Rich ladies will do charity work for the sick poor; pub raffles might purchase
a second-hand dialysis machine; failing that Princess Diana will hold the hands
of the poor till they die. That's how it's going. That's where it will end.
Discard your principles and you become ideologically naked, forced to pinch the
clothes of others and claim them as your own.
This week New Labour decided to abstain on a Government proposal within the
Budget to cut one penny off income tax. It might appear to be a ``triviality'',
as the health charges of 1951 were perceived by many on Labour's side. There
was, however, a principle involved.
A penny off income tax will cost the Exchequer nearly #2000m - money that can't
now be spent on badly damaged public services. By abstaining the parliamentary
Labour Party was, in a very real sense, an accomplice to an unprincipled misuse
of public funds. Even to vote for tax cuts would have been more dignified than
cowardly abstention, simulated opposition, or the parliamentary equivalent of a
fake orgasm.
I have never seen a British political party scatter its principles to the wind
as New Labour has done in the past 18 months. There is no discernible
difference with the Tories on economic, social, and foreign policies. New
Labour is really New Tory.
There is no distinctive philosophical base to New Labour's thinking. It reacts
to electoral phenomena and nothing else. A philosophical ambiguity reflected in
the leader's peculiar verbless mode of speech. Tough on crime. Tough on the
causes of crime. It's soap powder, sales pitch, patois. New Labour. New soft
soap. New Labour soft soap. Tough on dirt. Tough on the causes of dirt. Can
even erase memories of when Labour had principles of its own.

<HEADLINE>TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS NFC upbeat despite 63% profit slide</HEADLINE>

IT is early days yet in the reorganisation of NFC, the transport and logistics
group, both at a managerial and operational level, so it is not surprising its
financial performance worsened in the year to September 30. The group, which
has a new management team led by chairman Sir Christopher Bland, reported a 63%
decline in full-year profits to #38.6m.
However, the business has an excellent foundation on which to build given its
leading position in almost all its markets. Because of this the dividend was
held even though it is barely covered (0.7 times) by earnings per share.
Sir Christopher said dividend cover would be restored to a more realistic level
once profits had been driven up. He added he was confident that the people and
policies were in place to turn the business round.
The full-year result was adversely affected by a #35m restructuring provision.
This was added to a #21.9m provision brought forward. There were about #10m of
one-off costs related to a number of items including insurance claims and prior
years' legal claims. An 11% higher tax charge following errors last year also
affected the results.
Efforts are under way to improve operating performance throughout the
businesses through cost reduction and better management. For example, the UK
logistics business has been split into 12 parts each concentrating on
particular industry sectors.
Around 1000 jobs were lost in the year, the majority in the UK, including at
Pickfords where 18 depots have been closed. Within moving services, the
sluggish housing market and a fall in military business were offset by better
conditions in the office removal sector. Profitability on the continent was hit
by development costs in Eastern Europe.
Exel Logistics experienced very tough market conditions but it traded
profitably in the UK by the year-end. During the year, fixed-term contracts
representing #49m of revenue were renewed. A highlight for the division was the
agreement with Bass to form Tradeteam to serve the brewing and associated
trades in the UK. Losses in continental Europe increased and profits fell in
the US.
Margins for all major distributors have fallen in recent years, partly due to
the maturing of contracts, competitive pressure and the increasing
sophistication of customers. Food distribution, which is a major part of NFC's
business, is mature and industry analysts think it is unlikely to provide
growth opportunities much above inflation. This is leading to a greater focus
upon non-food retail, consumer goods and industry.
Despite its operational problems, NFC has succeeded in winning new business.
Logistics signed new accounts during the year with British Steel, Thorn EMI and
Marks &amp; Spencer. It has a wide geographic base but much of its continental
business, particularly in Germany, has had to be reorganised and its European
operations made a loss. The US business also faces difficult market conditions.

IF YOU feel a sense of deep foreboding next time you hand your family snaps in
to Boots you will not be alone. The announcement that no action is to be taken
against television newsreader Julia Somerville and her partner Jeremy Dixon
over photographs of her young daughter in the bath should be an end to a
disgraceful episode.
So where does this deep sense of residual unease come from?
It's not from the actions of the staff member who developed the pictures and
didn't share Mr Dixon's artistic pretensions. One man's art is, after all,
another man's dirty picture. And isn't vigilance in child protection urged upon
all of us? Hard as we may try, we cannot have it both ways.
It was heavy-handed if not necessarily wrong, when the store called in the
police, that they should arrive mob-handed in a crowded store to pounce when Mr
Dixon, all unsuspecting, arrived to pick up his film.
Nor was it entirely wrong that the force should call on the massed experience
of officers in the child pornography and paedophilia unit as well as offices
from an expert child protection team to scrutinise the photos in fine detail.
If they had chosen to ignore it, because he was a professional, smartly-dressed
man instead of some mythic slobbering perv in a dirty mac, that surely would be
more worrying.
That the lab assistant who clyped was induced by a fat cheque to sell his
exclusive story to the Sun says more about the ethics of those who paid him to
blab than it does about the greed of a lowly-paid worker. So, sadly, it's not
that.
What about the couple's eight-hour interrogation at a police station? Seems
tough, but it was a delicate investigation was it not?
And then the story was leaked. Ms Somerville blames Scotland Yard for leaking
details of her arrest which she says caused her great distress and public
humiliation. It's no surprise that someone sneaked. Happens all the time,
police stations being to secrets what leaky sieves are to a pot of peas.
But then the story, in all it's lip-smacking, salacious detail, was splashed
across the pages of every newspaper. Does disquiet stem from the usual tatty
problem of such stories of sexual scandal, the old chestnut of prurience
masquerading as puritanism? A distaste for the kind of exposure, with an
element of cruelty, that delights in seeing a celebrity twist in the wind,
while simultaneously, on the comment pages, clucking piously over the appalling
ordeal of poor Julia Somerville? Perhaps it's partly that.
BUT surely the most deplorable aspect of this whole sad, sordid story is in
danger of being missed. In case we forget, the real victim of this grotesque
tale is a seven-year-old child.
Her trust was betrayed. By the man who took the photographs, however
innocently. By the newspapers who identified her, whose flabby excuse will be
``oh well everyone else used Julia Somerville's name so why should we miss
out?''
If the Press Complaints Commission had any balls, if its current chairman
stopped playing footsie with the royal family and worrying about the finer
feelings of Rupert Murdoch long enough, he would act on an abject failure to
protect the interests of a child whose privacy has been invaded in the most
deplorable way. It is she who must live with the consequences. The humiliation,
shame, and ridicule will be her distressing legacy.
In this case, Julia Somerville and her partner were entirely innocent. The
damage was done not by the investigation of the case but by the manner in which
it was reported. The English Attorney-General continues to cluck over such
reporting but does not act to stop it. He must bear some responsibility.
There is one more feature of this sordid episode that causes unease and it's
this: we continue to hold a strangely ambivalent view of the sexual abuse of
children, giving off confused and conflicting signals.
Just as tragic as taking children away from innocent families, on the
half-baked beliefs of those who specialise in cranky theories on bottoms, is a
failure to protect children from parents who are committing serious abuse.
We refuse to believe figures on the sexual abuse of children. We know there is
massive cruelty in the world but this . . . no it cannot be true.
And we continue to lambast the authorities who are seen to fail when they don't
take action (think Cromwell Street) and who are vilified when, in however
hamfisted a manner, they do (think Orkney).
Lastly there is this: somehow the intimacy between children and parents is so
unlike any other kind of intimacy that maybe it's hard for us to comprehend
those who confuse what that intimacy is about. It's time we started trying
harder.

TELEVISION presenter Jeremy Clarkson is one of of three million people in
Britain expected to start 1996 by making a financial New Year's resolution.
The Top Gear presenter is resolving ``never to open a bank statement'', and
``smoke more'' while ``to back my horse every time it runs'' is the resolve of
BBC football commentator John Motson.
Some 33% of adults are resolved to cut down on their spending generally in the
coming year.
In contrast, 6% said they would try to spend more, while 35% will aim for a
specific item like a car or a holiday in the year ahead, according to survey
findings published recently by IFA Promotion, which promotes professional
independent financial advice.
Just 800,000 of the three million people expected to make financial New Year's
resolutions will stick to them, it predicts.
Other popular financial resolutions include paying off credit card bills,
mentioned by one in 10 people, and sorting out a pension cited by 8%.
Psychologist Dr David Lewis thinks the majority of those announcing New Year's
resolutions make those that are to do with breaking bad habits such as smoking,
nail biting or overeating.
About 12% make bold resolutions intended to shake up their lives, according to
Dr Lewis.

Stagecoach in train for record
subsidy after rail buy-out
PERTH-based bus giant Stagecoach Holdings, which looks set to become the first
private sector company to take over British Rail passenger services, is set to
receive an even greater subsidy than the public sector to run them.
Meanwhile, as if to underline that it is still very much in expansion mode,
Stagecoach yesterday announced the #12.6m acquisition of bus company Cambus
Holdings.which serves the Berkshire and Cambridge and Milton Keynes areas.
Franchising director Roger Salmon is understood to have awarded the South West
Trains franchise, one of the first three to be privatised, to Stagecoach.
It has been claimed that the Perth-based company, which is looking to link bus
and train timetables, as it expands on to the railway lines, will be given a
greater annual subsidy than the #70m which Mr Salmon currently pays to British
Rail.
A spokesman for the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising yesterday pointed out
that it was the bidders, rather than the franchising director, which named
their subsidy.
Bidders state the amount of Government funding they require on the basis of the
minimum service requirements specified by Mr Salmon.
Labour transport spokesman Brian Wilson last night urged the Office of Fair
Trading to investigate the implications of a successful Stagecoach bid before
any contract was signed.
He claimed Stagecoach would have a private monopoly in trains and buses over
large parts of the south of England.
Mr Wilson added that the likelihood of Stagecoach receiving a greater subsidy
exposed the ``ludicrous nature'' of the whole rail privatisation exercise.
Stagecoach executive chairman Brian Souter indicated last week that he
considered the south of England franchises the most attractive.
South West Trains, which operates the regional and commuter network out of
London's Waterloo, is the biggest of the 25 franchises being privatised.
However, with Mr Salmon not expected to announce the result of the South West
Trains auction until next week, Mr Souter would only say yesterday: ``We have
signed confidentiality undertakings and we are not at liberty to discuss the
matter.''
He indicated that the Stagecoach bid had been successful by stating his belief
that a newspaper report, claiming his company had won had come from the team
which made the ``failed management buy-out''.
A victory by Stagecoach would invalidate a previous claim by shipping company
Sea Containers, which last month pulled out of the race for the seven-year
passenger rail franchises, that only management buy-out teams were likely to
win them.
Stagecoach's proposals apparently required the least subsidy and were therefore
cheaper than the joint bid by South West Trains' management and French water
group Compagnie Generale des Eaux.
However, Mr Salmon's decision to set the ``minimum passenger requirements''
below the current level of service is currently being challenged by pressure
group Save the Railways in the High Court. A victory for Save the Railways
could still prompt a re-think.
It is not yet clear whether the Department of Trade and Industry would refer
the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The referral decision, when it is taken, will set a precedent for the entire
rail privatisation process.
Stagecoach and Network SouthCentral are gunning for the InterCity East Coast
service between London and Edinburgh and Midland Mainline, which runs trains
between Sheffield and London.
Stagecoach intends to bid for ScotRail, when it is eventually privatised,
although it does not consider it the most attractive train operating company.
Meanwhile, Stagecoach could once again fall foul of the UK competition
authorities as a result of its agreed 350p per share cash bid for Cambus.
Shares in Stagecoach yesterday recorded a new closing high for the year of
288p, after adding 4p.

ALAN WISEMAN is a happy man these days as business continues to increase for
Robert Wiseman Dairies. The purchases of the CWS and Hamiltons have raised its
market share to almost 44% and, more important for the longer term, the
Manchester development has been a success.
First-half profits jumped a third to #3.92m on turnover 19% greater at #58.9m.
That figure was struck after a #700,000 provision, largely for around 100
redundancies, against the reorganisation of the CWS operations which cost #6.6m
to acquire. That deal has helped boost Scottish milk volumes to one million
litres a day. The CWS previously sourced its Argyllshire and Dumfrieshire
supplies partly from Scottish Pride.
The Hamilton purchase, which cost #10m, half of which was debt, came just after
the interim period. Its reorganisation costs will be similar to those of the
CWS, although Wiseman is considering whether to use its modern dairy facilities
to produce UHT milk as a diversification from the fresh product.
Doorstep deliveries in Scotland are now down to about 15% but Mr Wiseman
believes they have stabilised.
Already #10m has been spent on the Manchester plant. That has helped Wiseman to
begin supplying liquid milk to 190 Iceland stores in the North of England in
addition to the 60 or so in Scotland which are serviced from local depots.
That will account for 20 million litres of milk annually out of Manchester's
initial production level of 85 million litres. This will double to 170 million
litres by late 1997. The additional capacity will cost just #2m. And there is
the potential to double even that volume through extended shift working.
Already the plant, which is well ahead of schedule, supplies Tesco, Safeway and
Morrison as well as Iceland locally, and negotiations are under way with J
Sainsbury and Asda.
Plans are also afoot to establish depots in Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool to
supply supermarkets in those areas.
Significantly, supermarket retail prices rose almost universally last weekend
by 2p for a four-pint container, pointing to an easing in margin pressure.
More acquisitions are certain - Wiseman has just 15% of the north British
market - comprising the area from Scotland down to Manchester - and 6% of the
UK overall.
Profits for the full-year should increase from #7m to about #10.2m. That would
leave the shares at 138p, compared with the 130p of the #14m rights issue,
trading at just under 15 times likely earnings. This seems cheap given the
medium-term potential.
The interim dividend has been raised 11% to 1p with a 3.2p total in sight for a
2.9% yield.

EDINBURGH was yesterday awarded World Heritage status by Unesco at its meeting
in Berlin.
Historic Scotland's submission to the judges said the capital represented the
cultural traditions of Scotland.
It had nurtured the growth of Scottish civilisation, its church, law, and legal
system.
The submission continued: ``The juxtaposition of Old and New Edinburgh offers
an outstanding example which epitomises significant stages in human history -
the Renaissance city on the rock versus the rationalist city on the plateau.''
Lord Provost Norman Irons said last night: ``This re-affirms Edinburgh's
position among the leading attractions of world cities.
``I am certain that the tourism industry as well as the city council will be
able to utilise this status to advantage, to highlight the scenic beauty of our
city.''
Councillor Eric Milligan, convener of Lothian region and the new unitary City
of Edinburgh Council, said he was delighted by the recognition.
``It is further confirmation of the city's premier standing in the
international arena and reflects the city's determination to both preserve its
unique and historic environment while developing as a vibrant place to live,
visit, and work.''
A spokesman for Historic Scotland said the recognition resulted from the
submission of a nomination by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Historic Scotland would discuss ways of continuing and developing the many
positive initiatives taken to conserve the character of Edinburgh as a
distinctive and vital World Heritage Site.
He added that while no new planning controls were imposed by the recognition,
it gave the city a seal of international approval which should help it attract
more visitors.
The spokesman added: ``An important feature in World Heritage sites is the
incentive to protect and enhance them.
``Edinburgh Old and New Towns have been successful in a bid to become a World
Heritage Site largely because these historic areas are protected by
conservation areas which extend well beyond the boundary of the area designated.
``This `buffer zone' is vital to the effective conservation of the setting of
the historic core.''

SCIENTISTS have identified substances in the human immune system which appear
to block the advance of the Aids virus.
Their discovery may explain why some people with HIV do not progress to
full-blown Aids and it could open the door to new forms of treatment.
The substances are a group of polypeptides secreted by CD8-T cells, a family of
white blood cells known for their ability to home in on HIV and other pathogens.
Nine years ago, an American researcher, Dr Jay Levy, reported that certain CD8
cells also appeared to inhibit replication of HIV and he and other scientists
have been trying since then to identify the suppressor factors involved.
Now a team led by Dr Robert Gallo - co-discoverer of the Aids virus itself -
and Dr Paulo Lusso think they have found the answer.
In a report in the journal, Science, next week they will describe how they
identified the polypeptides, or chemokines, which they have labelled RANTES,
MIP1-alpha, and MIP1-beta.
No difference was detected when the chemokines were tested individually but the
scientists were able to establish that RANTES, MIP1-alpha, and MIP1-beta acting
in combination had a suppressor effect on the virus.
Dr Gallo and Dr Lusso are soon to launch toxicology studies with the ultimate
goal of beginning human clinical trials at a new Institute of Human Virology at
Maryland University, of which Dr Gallo is director, and at the San Raffaele
Institute in Milan where Dr Lusso now works.
Controversy is likely to dog the discovery, however. Dr Levy, whose work was
treated sceptically for years, says he has already tried the three candidate
substances and ruled them out but Dr Lusso says that technological progress
enabled him and his colleagues to show up things which Dr Levy couldn't in the
past.

THE use of ``professional witnesses'' to give evidence in cases involving
anti-social behaviour by neighbours was advocated yesterday by Scottish Office
officials.
They were giving evidence to the Commons Select Committee on Scottish Affairs
against the background of figures which show that domestic noise complaints
rose from 269 in 1980 to 1939 in 1992-93, the last year for which figures are
available.
The Scottish Office is examining ways of dealing with neighbour disputes,
including the possible introduction of probationary tenancies, new noise
nuisance measures, the development of mediation schemes and the operation of
eviction arrangements.
The possibility of using professional witnesses - housing management teams or
inquiry agents - was raised by Mr Bill Walker, Tory MP for Tayside North, who
referred to peer pressure and intimidation in neighbour-dispute cases, which
meant one person was reluctant to give evidence against another for fear of
victimisation.
Mr Peter Beaton, director of the Scottish Courts Administration, said the basic
sanction against someone who intimidated a witness was a criminal sanction, but
he accepted this was an area in which authorities had to co-ordinate their
activities to protect witnesses.
Pressed on the matter of professional witnesses, Mr John Ewing, a senior civil
servant from the Housing Division of the Scottish Office, said: ``It is an area
worth all authorities exploring more fully.''
The committee was told that consideration still was being given to how
probationary tenancies would work. The Government appears to be moving towards
a situation where such tenancies only would apply to tenants with a previous
history of anti-social behaviour.
A suggestion from Tory MP Terry Dicks (Hayes and Harlington) that all the bad
tenants should be placed in one location - an idea that has been tried before -
was rejected by the officials. Mr David Belfall, from the Scottish Office
Housing Division, said: ``We have had experience in Scotland of some areas
attracting a very unwelcome reputation.''

<RECORDNO>975011964</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BEEF sales dropped by almost 5% last month compared to November last year, the
Meat and Livestock Commission said yesterday.
The drop coincided with a World in Action TV programme which claimed that 600
BSE-infected cows were being eaten each week in the UK. The commission is
blaming public fears over BSE - ``mad cow disease'' - for part of the November
slide, which comes after a few months of marginal growth in the beef market.
No figures are yet available for the week since neuropathologist Sir Bernard
Tomlinson added his voice to fears over beef. In the four weeks up to November
20, sales of all beef products - including the offal implicated by some
scientists in the human form of ``mad cow disease'', CJD - were down by 4.8%.
October's figure was 0.15% up on 1994 and September sales were 0.1% up on the
year before. August sales were down 14% but the commission attributes that to
the unusually hot weather which put people off the idea of a roast joint.
The commission has launched a poster and leaflet campaign to reassure butchers'
customers and has contacted schools and councils. A commission spokesman said:
``The scare over BSE must have some bearing on November's figures. Whether it
is entirely to blame or whether it is a natural blip, as people save their
pennies for Christmas, we don't know. It's probably a bit of both.
``The commission accepts the findings of those people who are actually engaged
in research into BSE and CJD, and that does not include Sir Bernard Tomlinson.
We are led to believe by those people involved in the research that beef is
safe.''

Borussia Dortmund   2
Rangers   2
ON a bitingly cold and inhospitable night when to stand still for longer than
five minutes meant the blood might have frozen solid, Rangers, as they had done
throughout the Champions' League series, ran about a lot. Again, however, the
endeavour of the Scottish champions was not enough.
Also, on a night when three of their players - Paul Gascoigne, John Brown and
Alan McLaren - had been relieved of anxiety over a police inquiry into their
behaviour during a premier-division match against Aberdeen last month, the
Ibrox club's disciplinary record was blackened.
Gascoigne was ordered off late in the match in the Westfalen Stadium,
apparently because he could not bite his tongue. He seemed to run alongside the
referee, Manuel Diaz Vega, after the Spaniard had refused to give a decision in
Rangers' favour, and it was perhaps inevitable that the match official would
round on the player, who had been booked in the first half for a foul on
Andreas Moller.
The midfielder, whose fragile temperament must be a concern for Rangers'
manager Walter Smith, is likely to face at least a one-game suspension when
Rangers next play in European competition. Smith would only say: ``The player
will have to look at himself because his dissent is happening too many times.''
Rangers' disciplinary record in this competition has been dismal. Gascoigne
becomes Rangers' fifth player to be suspended, and follows Gordon Durie and
Gordan Petric, who both collected two cautions, and McLaren and Alex Cleland.
These two were given bans after having been ordered off in Champions' League
matches, and Rangers also finished Group C with players each on one caution.
On top of that, it must be remembered that David Robertson, booked twice
against Famagusta in the preliminary rounds, also missed the opening match
against Steaua Bucharest.
En route to Dortmund, Smith had expressed a degree of anxiety that a number of
his players were on the threshold of suspension, but he never expected to see
Gascoigne being dismissed. The manager was satisfied with the team's
performance, and confirmed Gascoigne's red card was for dissent.
``It was disappointing to have that happen,'' he said, before stressing that he
was unwilling to discuss publicly what action ``if any'' will be taken against
the English internationalist.
Looking back on the team's six matches in Group C which yielded only three
points, the manager said: ``It was a very difficult tournament for us and we
could have done better had it not been for some injuries.''
Smith had been concerned beforehand about the condition of the pitch which was
rock hard and treacherous and he pointed out: ``I think UEFA will have to take
a look at the Champions' League.
``If they are going to have a competition of this magnitude at this time of the
year, they will have to look for better conditions.''
The evening had started in promising fashion for Rangers when Brian Laudrup
gave them an early lead, but the Germans, seven of whom were clad in black
tights to fend off the cold, responded in typical fashion scoring through
Andreas Moller and Karl Heinz Riedle before Durie equalised six minutes from
time.
That goal helped send the Rangers fans - they were approximately 3000 in number
- away with a smile although they, too, can only be concerned about Gascoigne
and the manner in which Rangers have struggled to impose themselves at this
level.
It was a Gascoigne pass which split a rather static and square Dortmund
defensive line and set up the opening goal in 10 minutes.
Miller read Gascoigne's intentions well and was able to take possession deep
inside the opposition's territory before drawing the German keeper, Stefan
Klos, from his line. The young Rangers player then squared the ball to Laudrup,
who arrived in the centre of Dortmund's box and knocked the ball into the empty
net.
Six minutes later, Dortmund had equalised. Richard Gough rose and headed out a
pass played from deep, but the ball fell to Andreas Moller who kept his balance
well and hit a powerful, low shot which beat Andy Goram.
Gascoigne went in heavily against Moller and the Rangers player was given his
second caution of this Champions' League series. Much worse was to follow for
him in the second half as he saw red for that dissent.
Miller also was booked in the first 45 minutes after he had tripped Carsten
Wolters.
While the risk of playing Karl Heinz Riedle - back after a six months' absence
- appeared obvious, the striker's composure was exemplary only two minutes into
the second half when he put his side in front. Heiko Herrlich delivered the
ball from the left into Rangers' box where Gary Bollan had to re-adjust his
stance, but lost his footing in the process, allowing the ball to carry all the
way to Riedle. His low shot was powerful and true.
A couple of minutes after Gascoigne had been sent off, Rangers made a change,
taking off Cleland and sending on Ian Durrant, but a goal behind, a man down,
and time running away from them, the Ibrox side appeared forlorn.
Dortmund were fully aware that all they had to do was keep possession and they
did not seem perturbed in any way when McCoist took over from Miller eight
minutes from time. The home side also made a second change when the South
American Ruben Sosa was sent on in place of Martin Kree.
Despite their problems, Rangers managed to leave their fans in good spirits
after Durie scored the equaliser six minutes from time. Laudrup's cross from
the right was mis-hit by McCall, but the ball fell to Durie, and he made a
thoroughly professional job of beating Klos.

<HEADLINE>Bid to ban boxing fails by one vote</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975011966</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MOVE to ban professional boxing was blocked by just one vote in the Lords
last night.
A backbench Bill aimed at outlawing the sport was effectively wrecked as peers
voted by 39 to 38 for an amendment postponing it for six months.
However, minutes before the result was announced, Labour's Lord Taylor of
Gryfe, the Boxing Bill's promoter, told the House: ``I will return to this
subject time and time again.''
Lord Taylor, who has tried unsuccessfully twice before to win support for
similar backbench legislation, said: ``I abhor violence and I will pursue that
principle as long as I am in this House.''
Earlier, he said his latest attempt to ban boxing had been prompted by the
death in October of Scottish bantamweight James Murray, two days after a
contest.
However, Tory the Earl of Shrewsbury, proposing the ``wrecking'' amendment,
defended boxing and said: ``I do not believe it is for Parliament to legislate
against sport, for this particular sport or for sport in general. Adaptation
and not banning is the answer.''
Lord Taylor emphasised that he was not trying to ban amateur boxing, only the
professional sport.
He spoke of the catalogue of recent boxing tragedies. ``The recent history in
the ring is not a very edifying experience: Michael Watson is now paralysed and
in a wheelchair, Gerald McClellan is permanently paralysed, Bradley Stone died
just some 18 months ago, James Murray died only a few weeks ago.
``So there should be some concern about that kind of experience and that kind
of record.''
However Lord Shrewsbury said of boxing: ``Of course, it is a contact sport,
which by its very nature carries very serious risks to participants - but so do
all contact sports.''
He said that boxing was not the most high-risk sport and boxers had a
completely free choice as to whether they took it up or not.
National Heritage Minister Lord Inglewood said the Government agreed that
boxers' safety must be paramount: ``But we don't believe the professional sport
should be banned and cannot support this Bill.''
He said there were more deaths and injuries in other sports. Boxing was
voluntary, tightly regulated and popular.
``We believe individuals should have the freedom voluntarily to participate in
the sport of their choice, as long as they're fully aware of the risks'' he
said.
Opposition Front Bencher Lord Donoughue, emphasising that he was voicing his
own opinion, said: ``This is a puritanical measure. It picks out one sport, and
not the most dangerous, and seeks to eliminate individual freedom to choose to
play it.''
Labour former Sports Minister Lord Howell opposed the Bill, saying: ``The
overriding question is not whether we should ban boxing. It is whether we
should prevent the exercise of free will on behalf of citizens who, knowing all
the dangers, nevertheless wish to participate in this sport.''
Lord Airedale (Lib. Dem.) said: ``After the tragedy in Glasgow, every spectator
needs to say to himself: if I and my fellow spectators didn't enjoy this
entertainment of watching two young men trying to bash each other into
insensibility, that young man who is now dead would still be alive today.''

THE Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd, yesterday moved to increase her already
formidable authority over MPs by hinting at the fate that might befall serious
offenders.
``As a former Whip myself, I can tell this House that when I used to keep
Members out of a division lobby it was with a single nelson and when I needed
them to go into the division lobby it was a double nelson,'' she fondly
recalled.
Tory MPs were charitably speaking up for potential Labour rebels who had wanted
to vote with the Liberal Democrats and the Nationalists against the 1p income
tax cut in the Budget the previous night. The spirit of Christmas arriving
early perhaps.
These, unnamed, potential rebels had been deterred by Labour whips ``standing
shoulder to shoulder'' at the doors to the division lobbies, claimed Sir Irvine
Patnick (Sheffield Hallam - Con.) sympathetically. As a Government Whip at the
time of the Maastricht Treaty Bill, he must be something of a connoisseur of
intimidation.
Apparently, the principles of some would-be rebels blanched as they approached
the lobby only to see the pleasant Mr Nick Brown (Newcastle-upon-Tyne East),
Labour's deputy Chief Whip, and the amiable Mr Eric Clarke (Midlothian), the
Scottish Whip, standing there.
The Sketch admits to a degree of dereliction of duty on that occasion, chatting
to one or two colleagues in the Press Gallery and not keeping the Chamber doors
to the ``no'' lobby under constant observation.
Nonetheless, anything like a single nelson or an arm lock could surely hardly
have escaped the attention of the media, always on the lookout, as its members
are, for deviations from the normal run of things.
An even more eagle-eyed observer was present and Miss Boothroyd said she had
observed nothing out of order. Mr Robert Hughes (Harrow West - Con.) had an
ingenious answer to that. The intimidators had operated out of the Speaker's
``eyeline'' which is why she had not noticed the ``assaulting, insulting and
menacing,'' which he, having a different ``eyeline'' at his disposal, had seen
happening.
The Speaker remained adamant that she had noted nothing amiss. Nor, she added,
had any MP complained to her about being prevented from voting. As MPs raised
with her matters like the air quality in the Commons and the inadequate means
of attracting taxi drivers to Members wanting to leave the precincts, she felt
sure a serious matter like being prevented from voting would have been brought
to her attention.
This could, of course, underestimate the intimidatory effect of Smiler Nick and
Hard Eric on the weaker brethren and sistern of the PLP, especially with the
ultimate threat of being dragged before Big Donald for the treatment.
All this was more entertaining though not, indeed, as important as Trade and
Industry questions in which almost the only bright moment came when Mr Dennis
Canavan (Falkirk West - Lab.) took up the President of the Board of Trade, Mr
Ian Lang, over his ``unemployment is a state of mind'' remark - a distortion,
said President Lang.
Mr Canavan rammed home his point in the vernacular. With his Galloway and Upper
Nithsdale majority at a modest 2468, did the Minister not have a sense that
``his own jaiket is on a very shoogly nail'', an attack which could only be
properly appreciated, or indeed comprehended, in the Scottish Grand Committee
or a Scottish parliament.
As for intimidation, Mr Dennis Skinner (Bolsover - Lab.), one of the gallant 10
who made it past the custodians of Labour unity, showed the right stuff of
which real rebels are made. ``I spent two minutes with a Whip before I went
in,'' he confessed to the Speaker, ``and I nearly got him to go into the lobby
with me.''

<HEADLINE>Scots are  correct to defy Government guidelines on beef products, says association Caterers back schools on BSE</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>RAYMOND DUNCAN ROB ROBERTSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SCHOOLS across Britain were advised last night by a leading caterers' trade
group to defy Government guidelines and steer away from beef products until the
controversy over ``mad cow disease'' was resolved.
As Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg continued to insist British beef was
``wholly safe'' and said parents should be encouraging children to eat it, two
top private schools in Scotland defended their decision to take beef products
off their menus.
The row comes as new figures reveal that beef sales in Scotland have fallen by
about 3% over a year.
The controversy has also involved the BBC, which said it had ``apologised
unreservedly'' to the makers of Bovril after mistakenly using the brand name on
a BBC helpline, said to be advising people to avoid beef products.
A BBC spokesman said one operator had mistakenly mentioned Bovril when he
intended to use the more generic term stock cubes as the kind of beef products
some scientists believe may carry some risks.
In the light of the controversy over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or
``mad cow disease'', Mary Erskine School and Fettes College, both in Edinburgh,
have said beef offal products would be taken off their school menus.
The move has been backed by the Local Authority Caterers' Association, which
said school caterers should consider using more chicken, turkey, and pork until
the controversy was resolved.
The move came as a political row erupted over the Government's handling of the
latest BSE scare.
Labour Shadow Agriculture Minister Gavin Strang accused the Government of doing
`` too little, too late''.
Mr Strang said: ``You cannot blame people for erring on the side of caution,
because the Government have been slow to act to combat the alarm on this
issue.''
Mr Hogg, who visited London's Smithfield meat market yesterday in an attempt to
boost the beef industry, maintained the scare was unfounded.
He said he was furious at the BBC helpline on BSE and said he was ``absolutely
certain'' British beef was safe.
Meanwhile, the Edinburgh schools explained why they had taken beef products off
their menus.
Deputy head of Mary Erskine School, Ms Norma Rolls said the beef products would
be off their menu until Christmas. ``We have taken that decision to give us
time to review the situation,'' she said.
Mr Cameron Thaw, bursar at Fettes, said it had ``adopted the new menus in the
light of perceived problems''.
A policy has been drawn up by the college that whole beef would continue to be
served in the refectory but ``pies, patties, sausages, and the like, made from
beef'' would not be served for the time being.
Alternative dishes for those who were nervous about eating whole beef would
always be available, said the bursar.
He described the school's approach as both cautious and responsible. The policy
will be reviewed once the scare is over, or further guidelines are issued from
official sources, he stated.
``We have not excluded beef because we think it is an important part of the
nutritious diet for pupils at the college, which operates a cafeteria system,''
said Mr Thaw.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, an advisory
body, said each school would decide its own policy and what was in the best
interests of their pupils.
``I can't make global pronouncements but I can say we have not had any parents
in touch with us about the issue. We also have had no contact from the Scottish
Office.
``We would give advice to schools but any decision on pupils' nutrition would
be taken internally.''
Last night, a Scottish Office spokesman said there were no guidelines on what
should be on menus at state-run schools. ``That is a matter for local
authorities to decide for themselves,'' said a spokesman.
The spokesman re-iterated the Government view, that there was no evidence of a
link between BSE disease in animals being transferred into humans.
Scottish Office figures show that the number of cases of BSE in animals in
Scotland has been falling since its peak in 1993. In that year, 2208 cases of
mad cow disease were identified.
The following year, that figure had fallen to 1326 and, up until November 17 of
this year, 514 cases had been identified.
The Scottish Office said the outbreak of BSE started from the use in animal
feed of ruminant protein derived from sheep affected by scrapie. The spokesman
said strict controls of the movement of animals and other new measures had
helped keep the disease under control.
Meanwhile, the brain expert whose warnings on BSE triggered the latest scare,
said he would be outlining his concerns to the Government in the next few days.
Neuropathologist Professor Sir Bernard Tomlinson said he would be writing to
the chairman of the committee which advises the Department of Health on BSE.

THE chances of John Collins continuing his career at Parkhead next season
increased yesterday with the news that Celtic manager Tommy Burns has
recommended a package deal to the board to be offered to the player before his
contract ends next summer.
Scottish internationalist Collins at one time during the season suggested that
the club was nudging him towards the exit door, but the differences between the
parties seem to have eroded.
Collins has been in tremendous form and his consistency of performance has
delighted the management. ``There has never been any question that we want to
see John stay with Celtic,'' said assistant manager Billy Stark, ``and we will
be delighted if this recommendation means he will sign a new contract here.''
Stark also took time to express his astonishment at reports which claimed
Celtic had bid #1m for Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Steve Bull. ``We once
made an inquiry about him, just as we have done with a number of players, but
Graham Taylor, who was the Wolves manager at the time, indicated that the lad
was very much a home-loving boy and would not leave Wolves. We never got near
the stage of considering a bid.''
In more positive mode, Stark was able to confirm that midfield man Phil
O'Donnell, who last played in October against Paris St Germain, is moving into
contention for a place in the side to meet Hibs at Easter Road on Saturday.
``He has had three games in the reserves now and is running freely,'' said
Stark, ``and it would be lucky for us if he could come back at the time Peter
Grant goes out on suspension.''
Meanwhile, Celtic have been given the go-ahead to open the temporary stand,
capacity 3000, recently erected.
The Strathclyde Safety for Sports Grounds committee have granted a certificate
for the temporary structure which will be open for the first time on Tuesday at
Paul McStay's testimonial against Manchester United.
It will increase the capacity of the re-developed ground to just more than
37,000.
q WILLIE Furphy is a spy in the Highlands for Albion Rovers. The Division 3
club will meet Deveronvale on Saturday in the opening round of the Tennents
Scottish Cup.
Furphy is an important player with Ross County, having spent a spell in the
Highland League. But he also trains with Albion Rovers each week.
Cliftonhill manager Jimmy Crease said: ``Willie knows the Highland League and,
as he is still with Ross County and up north regularly, he hears what is
happening. I have been quizzing him and have picked up information.''

A CONVICTED drugs dealer claimed yesterday that a Grampian Police officer
facing charges of corruption was a scapegoat and other officers should be
sitting beside him in the dock.
Ronald Cormack - a prisoner serving 15 years for drug offences - was giving
evidence at the High Court in Aberdeen where Police Constable Neil Cooper
denies corruption charges.
Under cross examination by Mr Kevin Drummond QC, for Mr Cooper, Cormack was
asked if he did not like the police. He replied: ``I have nothing against the
police in general but there are some police officers who are bigger criminals
than those walking the streets.
``I feel sorry for Neil. He is being made a scapegoat.
``There should be others beside him.''
Asked to name them, Cormack said: ``Hamish Moir should be sitting there facing
serious charges.''
Cormack earlier told the court that when he stopped a financial agreement with
Mr Cooper, he continued to receive information about police activities through
his friend Mr Bill Smith, said in court to be a police informant, who had
obtained it from two other Grampian Police officers, Mr Hamish Moir and Mr
Colin Clark.
He also claimed he received information through ``pillow talk'' which a friend
had with an ``undercover'' policewoman.
He insisted, however, that Mr Cooper had been a source of information for which
he had paid.
Earlier, Cormack said he made incriminating tape recordings of conversations he
had with Mr Cooper ``as an insurance policy.''
However, Cormack said the tapes, along with 1000 rounds of ammunition and part
of a gun he used in an assault, had disappeared when he was arrested.
Mr Cooper is accused of three corruption charges involving Cormack, including
accepting #6000 and other payments from him for details of police intelligence
and surveillance operations.
Mr Cooper has lodged a special defence to the charge of accepting money
claiming the offences were committed by police officer Mr James Grimmer, of
Kinmundy Avenue, Skene.
Cormack said he had recorded meetings and telephone conversations between
himself and Mr Cooper who, he alleged, had supplied information about
surveillance operations on Cormack and the names of police informants.
Asked why he had tape recorded the conversations, he replied: ``It was
insurance. I didn't trust Neil Cooper. Just in case - insurance against being
set up.''
Asked if he was suggesting that the Scottish Crime Squad had been involved in
the disappearance of the tapes he said: ``It could easy be. Officers from the
Scottish Crime Squad lied in this box at my trial.''
``They (the tapes) didn't exist,'' Mr Drummond suggested. ``They do exist but
where they are I don't know,'' Cormack said.
Cormack said he ended his association with Mr Cooper early in 1994 but
continued to receive information from other police officers through Mr Smith.
He denied ever having told his business partner Ian McLaren that the policeman
he was paying for information was a Sergeant called Grimmer.
``Did you tell him the sergeant had a gambling problem and a wife who liked
spending money,'' Mr Drummond asked him.
``I cannot recall that,'' Cormack replied.
He said he had given his wife a ``bug'' which he had detected in his garage
premises and she was to give it to his lawyer to put in the bank as part of his
defence if he was every arrested.
He said he was convinced the device had been planted illegally by the police
and was sure there were others in the premises.
The trial continues.

JOHN Crawley will fill the England No.3 spot for today's match against Boland.
He replaces Mark Ramprakash and now looks certain to keep that place when the
Test series resumes in Durban next week.
Crawley started with an innings of 85 against a South African Invitation XI at
Soweto, then made 108 against Border in East London before taking 90 off Orange
Free State.
Good form against provincial sides is no guarantee of Test success, however.
Ramprakash began the tour well - then made nine, four, and nought when Allan
Donald and co provided the opposition.
Mike Atherton will sit out the four-day game against Boland. Devon Malcolm,
Angus Fraser, and Dominic Cork are also rested. The England team is:
Stewart (capt), Smith, Crawley, Thorpe, Hick, Russell (wkt), Watkinson, Gough,
Illingworth, Illot, Martin.
q BRIAN Lara claims that his dispute with the West Indies management could
strengthen the team. Lara says that the dispute ``is a very small matter, but I
hope my stand can bring everything out in the open.''
He withdrew from the World Series Cup tour after he was fined for being absent
without permission for three days during a summer tour of England. His
withdrawal from the tour shocked fans worldwide and prompted debate about a
lack of discipline on the West Indies team.
Lara said: ``My issue is small and hopefully next Friday when the West Indies
board meet they could address the real facts and what's facing West Indies
cricket,'' he said. There is precedent for governments intervening in cricket
controversies. Trinidad's prime minister, Basdeo Panday, has said that ``if it
becomes necessary, government could become involved in resolving the matter.''

THE Scottish National Party yesterday claimed to be leading the way in the
fight against fuel poverty, with measures worth #1.7m being implemented this
winter by the councils it currently controls.
In West Lothian District, for example, 19,000 pensioners will receive a #30
payment equal to about three weeks' fuel costs.
Speaking in Aberdeen, SNP vice-convener for local government Councillor Maureen
Watt claimed that every winter thousands of vulnerable people died as a direct
result of fuel poverty in Scotland.
In a country rich in energy, each of these deaths was entirely preventable, she
said.
Because of this the SNP had schemes in Grampian region, Tayside and West
Lothian district which directly combated the problem of fuel poverty and energy
plenty.
``I challenge all parties in local government to follow our lead so that the
most vulnerable in Scotland need no longer suffer the misery and danger of a
long cold winter with insufficient fuel'' Councillor Watt said.
Councillor Watt said that in West Lothian the SNP was making payments of #30 to
each pensioner in the district. It had introduced the scheme with #10 payments
three years ago and through careful budget management was now able to increase
the sum to #30 at a cost of #600,000.
Tayside Region's SNP leader Councillor Ewan Dow said that over #1m was being
spent over two years in combating fuel poverty in the area. This year's
comprehensive package would contain a number of measures including free checks
to ensure all benefits were being claimed and the waiving of charges for
meals-on-wheels and lunch clubs over the winter months.
Last year, he said 6000 benefit checks had been carried out and more than
#50,000 worth of free meals had been provided.
Councillor Joyce Stewart, Grampian's social work convener, said this year's
#325,000 package would include benefit checks and voluntary organisations as
well as local authorities would be able to waive lunch club and
meals-on-wheels' charges. Applications would also be invited to a fuel fund
worth #30,000.

SCOTTISH international striker Duncan Ferguson will return to English
premiership action on Monday while he waits for a date to be arranged for a
further court hearing which will argue the merits of the 12-match ban imposed
on him by the SFA.
Ferguson, who was transferred to Everton by Rangers for #4.3m a year ago, had
his suspension put on hold by Lord Prosser at the Court of Session in Edinburgh
after argument for a judicial review was made by the player.
The striker was released recently from Barlinnie Prison after having served 44
days of a three-months sentence following an assault on Raith Rovers defender
John McStay in a match at Ibrox in April, 1994.
The reprieve means that Ferguson will play in a reserve match specially
arranged against Newcastle United today, and if he comes through unscathed, he
is likely to play against West Ham United on Monday.
Everton had insisted that the player had been punished twice for the same
offence, but the judge said he was not impressed by that argument. However, he
did agree to a full hearing as he felt there was a question of interpretation
at stake, and the matter should be investigated further. That is not likely to
take place until well into next year.
Ferguson's lawyer, Leonard Wallace, argued that the SFA rules stated that the
committee could impose ``additional'' punishment on a player who had misbehaved
during play, but Ferguson had not been cautioned or sent off during the game
and no report about it had been submitted to the SFA.
Philip Brodie QC, representing the SFA, said his interpretation of the use of
the word ``additional'' meant ``other'' and if Mr Wallace's understanding of it
was correct, then any on-the-field offences missed by the referee or the
linesmen could not be dealt with by the committee.
After having been presented with two hours of argument by lawyers representing
Ferguson and the SFA, Lord Prosser made it clear that he was sceptical about a
submission that the player had been ``tried'' twice for the same offence.
The judge suggested that this was the most dubious of Mr Wallace's arguments.
He said that half of the people in the country had written contracts providing
that a person found guilty of a criminal offence would be sacked.
He also gave the example of a doctor who raped a patient being tried by the
courts and subjected to professional disciplinary procedure. But he felt that
Mr Wallace had presented a stateable argument on the interpretation of the
disciplinary rules under which the player was suspended.
Ferguson is ultimately seeking a judicial review of the ban.
Meanwhile, the news of the suspension being lifted - he still has seven games
to serve - was greeted with predictable enthusiasm on Merseyside.
Everton captain Dave Watson said that it had given everybody at the club a
lift. He added that Ferguson had been in the thick of a practice match when
news from the court reached the club. ``He was having a hard time in training
when he got the call to go up stairs. He said he was just delighted to get out
of training. But seriously, we are delighted at the news.
``The lads are pleased for him because he has worked very hard since coming out
of jail. This seems to be his bit of a break and I'm sure he'll grab it. ``When
you train all week and there's nothing at the end, it does get you down a bit.
He's got something to look forward to now. The reserve game tomorrow will
probably get 20,000 fans, that's how influential Duncan is on Merseyside.
``If he comes through that match, then there's a chance for Monday. He has a
big influence here. He's a character on and off the field. He gets people
around him playing and apart from that he's an outstanding player himself.''
Ferguson sat out one match for Rangers before the ban was put on hold pending
the court hearing, and then joined Everton after two months on loan at Goodison.
He played in only the first two matches of this season before needing a hernia
operation. The club's last four games, against QPR, Sheffield Wednesday,
Liverpool and Tottenham, have counted towards the suspension.

NOTTINGHAM Forest may have to risk plunging deeper into debt to preserve their
proud status as Britain's lone remaining standard-bearers in Europe this season.
Manager Frank Clark wants to buy reinforcements for his squad, realising that
even the ring of defensive steel which has helped Forest to progress to the
UEFA Cup quarter-finals is unlikely to repel the sides now looming on the
horizon.
Forest's accounts book reveals a secured bank overdraft of #6.5m, and although
they sold Stan Collymore to Liverpool for #8.5m, they almost wiped that out by
buying Kevin Campbell, Andrea Silenzi, and Chris Bart-Williams.
Success in Europe - at the expense of three moderate victims in Malmo, Auxerre,
and Lyon - is pumping some cash back into coffers, and live television coverage
of both third-round legs against Lyon is expected to help generate around #1.2m.
However, the top players Clark would want are valued at astronomical figures.
``I'm always looking to improve the side and I would be interested in any good
players who become available,'' said Clark. ``But you will have to ask the
chairman about finances. I don't know what, if any, percentage of the money we
have made from the UEFA Cup will be available for me to spend.
``The bank manager may like to see the club reduce the overdraft a bit first.''
Bryan Roy will be back from his recent knee operation in time for the UEFA Cup
quarter-finals in March, expecting to rediscover more of his true form which
was diluted this season by the gradual deterioration of a torn cartilage.
Having come so far in Europe in such determined style, Clark's team will
undoubtedly need to step up a gear now - and the big doubt is whether they have
the personnel to do so.
However, one man who should be a big asset to Forest in their quest for greater
glory on the European stage is Scot Gemmill, the Scottish internationalist, and
he would like nothing better than for his club to be drawn against AC Milan in
the quarter-final stage.
Gemmill has his fingers crossed that the Italian team do not slip up in their
second-leg tie tonight at Sparta Prague, leading 2-0 from the first leg.
``I would love AC Milan to get through because it would be a dream to play in
the San Siro in March,'' said Gemmill. ``There are so many great teams left in
the competition, but it would be a bit special to play against Baresi and Co.''

Brussels
LABOUR Euro-MP for Lothians David Martin said last night he believed the
European Commission was about to announce the scrapping of a review threatening
continued EU aid to large areas of Scotland.
The money involved goes to so-called Objective 2 areas which are classified as
suffering from industrial decline.
A mid-term review was built into the agreement reached on structural funding
support for needy areas at the Edinburgh summit. There were worries that
Scotland could have lost more than #200m between next year and the end of the
century.
Mr Martin's statement came after an informal meeting of the Council of
Ministers in Madrid last week. Although such meetings do not take explicit
decisions, the Ministers apparently found no support for the principle of a
mid-term review.
Mr Martin said: ``They took the view that it would be premature to start
cutting the programme at this stage when money was just beginning to flow to
the projects.''
He described the news as ``an excellent Christmas present by the Commission''.

WORLD champion Stephen Hendry came from behind to chalk up his fourteenth
successive victory in the second round of the German Open in Frankfurt
yesterday.
The Scot made a second-frame break of 126 en route to a 5-3 win over Malta's
Tony Drago and will face 24-year-old Liverpudlian Rod Lawler in tonight's
quarter-finals.
Hendry lost three of the first four frames and admitted: ``I couldn't afford to
let Tony get any further ahead. It was vital for me to win the fifth frame.''
The UK champion did so, and breaks of 79, 72, and 56 carried him through to the
last eight.
The Scot was only 51 points in front with four reds left on the table -
potentially 59 points - when Drago conceded the eighth frame and the match
after having missed an easy pink.
Hendry said later: ``I'm finding it difficult to get as psyched up for this
tournament as I was in the UK championship. However, I had to slow down the
pace to keep Tony away from the table for long periods. He became very nervous
because of it.''
Lawler, No.45 in the global rankings, caused an upset when he defeated the
world No.5, James Wattana 5-2. Lawler out-potted the Thai, who has yet to get
beyond the last 16 of a ranking tournament this season.
Wishaw's John Higgins had to hit back from 2-0 down in his 5-3 win over Mark
King, who had beaten Ronnie O'Sullivan in the first round. The Scot had runs of
88 and 30 as he reached 4-2 and after King had narrowed the gap, Higgins
cleared the colours in frame eight for victory. Second-round results:
S Hendry (Scotland) beat T Drago (Malta) 5-3; R Lawler (England) beat J Wattana
(Thailand) 5-2; J Higgins (Scotland) beat M King (England) 5-3; D Morgan
(Wales) beat N Bond (England) 5-1.

THE level of entrance fees to historic sites in Scotland was defended strongly
yesterday by officials from the Scottish Office Development Department.
Attendances at Historic Scotland sites in 1994-95 fell by 110,000 to 2.3m
visitors, but there was a 53% increase in real terms in income from admission
charges.
Pressed on the matter at a session of the Commons Public Accounts Committee
yesterday, Mr Graeme Munro, director and chief executive of Historic Scotland,
said there was an annual review which took account of inflation.
A family of four, for example, would pay #14 for admission to Edinburgh Castle,
and there were special arrangements such as free days for school parties. He
claimed that the charges were at proper commercial rates and were ``very
competitive.''
The committee was told that there are now 6100 scheduled monuments in Scotland,
an increase of 22% since 1991. The broad estimate of perhaps 10,000-12,000
monuments not as yet assessed for scheduling remains unchanged.

A HIGHLAND ice rink had no ammonia detection system installed when potentially
lethal fumes escaped into the main arena two weeks ago.
More than 200 people, mostly children, were evacuated from Inverness Ice Rink
and a nine-year-old asthmatic boy, John MacLean, of Conon Bridge, almost died.
His heart stopped several times in the incident during an ice hockey tournament
between teams from Inverness and Glasgow.
About 30 people were hospitalised.
The rink reopened for business within hours.
It emerged yesterday that, unlike most other rinks in Scotland, Inverness Ice
Rink had no detection system, which would have set off alarms and prevented the
distressing side-effects of a major ammonia escape, such as burning eyes and
breathing difficulties.
Rink management and owners, Taylor Clark Leisure Ltd, had refused to confirm or
deny whether a detection system was fitted to the refrigeration plant room
where the leak began.
Yesterday, the firm again refused to comment.
The lack of detection equipment was confirmed yesterday by Inverness District
Council's environmental health department who took over the investigation from
the Health and Safety Executive.
However, a spokesman said senior management had agreed to instal the detectors
which would be linked to a mechanical extract ventilation system.
The company also would call in an ammonia expert to give staff and the
emergency services a presentation on the safe use, handling, and emergency
procedures associated with ammonia.
The spokesman added: ``Inquiries are continuing with the full co-operation of
the company and we are keeping our options open on further action. No report
has gone to the procurator fiscal.
``There is no specific legal requirement for an alarm system to be installed in
ice rinks. It all comes down to risk assessment.''

<HEADLINE>Major says Europe must recognise dangers over monetary union Premier warns of currency `chaos'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975011979</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
JOHN MAJOR yesterday issued a blunt warning of ``chaos and difficulty'' across
Europe if mistakes were made over moves towards a single currency.
Many questions about European monetary union remained unanswered, said the
Prime Minister, in Florence for a one-day summit with his Italian counterpart
Lamberto Dini.
``It is not a question of slowing it down or speeding it up, if and when it
proceeds it has got to be right.
``If it isn't right, there will be chaos and difficulty right across Europe,''
he told journalists at a news briefing after the talks.
The Prime Minister said Europe had to be certain what the implications were in
this ``novel procedure'' of single currency.
He said the question was to make sure Europe knew what the implications were of
proceeding if only a minority of member states went ahead.
``The working assumption would be that less than half of the European Union
would meet the Maastricht criteria and be able to proceed by January 1, 1999.''
Europe should examine these issues and ``see what they mean.''
The timing and decisions could affect enlargement of the EU, he said.
Mr Major said he was sceptical at the suggestion of a new form of Exchange Rate
Mechanism outside the single currency, proposed by the Germans.
Italy takes over the EU presidency when the inter-governmental conference on
the Union's political and economic future gets under way next year.
The Italians were angered at the EU summit in September when Germany's finance
minister Theo Waigel said Italy would fail to meet the criteria for the
take-off of European monetary union planned in 1999.
Meanwhile, Tory infighting over Europe resurfaced yesterday with a sharp attack
on former leadership challenger John Redwood by ex-Foreign Minister Tristan
Garel-Jones.
Mr Garel-Jones criticised those urging Mr Major to rule out any prospect of a
single Euro-currency for at least the next six years - likening them to having
a #10 each-way bet on the Grand National and being invited to tear up the slip
for a #20 bet to win.
``I think I would assume that my interlocutor was either a visitor from outer
space who had never been to a racecourse in his life, or that he was a bent
jockey,'' Mr Garel-Jones wrote in the London Evening Standard.
The MP's friends made clear this was a swipe at Mr Redwood, nicknamed ``the
Vulcan'' by his critics.
Sweeping reform of Europe's system for fixing farm support prices was demanded
in the Commons yesterday by Euro-sceptic Tory Tony Marlow.
In a short debate, Mr Marlow (Northampton North) protested that the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) discriminated against UK farmers.
The former whipless Conservative demanded free trade in agriculture and the
repatriation of powers to Britain.
Another Tory Euro-sceptic, Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow), said the CAP was wide
open to fraud, and added: ``I cannot for the life of me understand why a
Conservative Government can be such a willing accomplice to a Soviet-style
central plan.''
q.Mr Major said yesterday that he is to press the EU for a crackdown on the
``pollution'' caused by the illegal drugs trade from South America to Europe.
``What I would like the EU to do is to examine effective help for small
Caribbean states to cut off the shipment of drugs from Latin America to
northern Europe,'' he said.

SCOTLAND will be hosting two tournaments on the American Express Tour, whose
1996 schedule was announced yesterday by chief executive Terry Coates.
McDonald's, who sponsor one of the four majors on the LPGA Tour in America,
will be backing the WPGA championship on August 8 to 11 at a Scottish course
still to be announced. It will be the first Tour event to be played solely for
charity with all proceeds going to the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities.
This is one of four new tournaments on the schedule of 20 events, an increase
of two from this season, while prize-money approaching #3m will be a record for
the Tour.
The only casualty is the Ford Classic after 14 years. This year at Chart Hills
in Kent it had prize-money of #110,000. Ford, however, will continue to sponsor
the Order of Merit.

THE Princess of Wales opened the new English National Ballet School in London
yesterday as the Prince of Wales tried his hand at bingo calling before
visiting a new housing estate in Cheshire.
The princess was at ease despite the political tensions surrounding her bid to
become an unofficial ambassador for Britain.
A former ballet dancer herself, she is expected to be put through her paces by
Prime Minister John Major and palace officials before any decision on her
future role is revealed.
The new ENB school in Chelsea, established with #87,000 of lottery cash as part
of a #250,000 funding package, has 31 students, aged 16 to 20, on a two-year
full-time course with fees of #13,000.
Meanwhile, Prince Charles also seemed in his element as he called bingo numbers
on a visit to Chester.
Around 600 bingo regulars packed the Top Rank Club in the town where the prince
was calling the numbers for a special game.
He watched as one of his Prince's Trust officials received a cheque for #75,000
raised by Top Rank at its clubs throughout the country.
When he took the microphone, he said, to laughter from his mainly female
audience: ``I've a ghastly feeling that what you would much rather do is get on
with this game of bingo rather than having me telling you things.''
``Four and nine, forty nine,'' the prince began haltingly, but was soon into
his stride, calling out the numbers with growing confidence.
A couple of gaffes - neglecting to shout ``On its own'' when numbers eight and
nine came up, and ``All the fives'' for 55 - were good humouredly received by
the crowd.
House was called by Mrs Rose Jones, 64, from Chester. Her prize is a trip to
London and a tour of Buckingham Palace.
Earlier, the prince visited Runcorn to see Hallwood Park, the award-winning
Merseyside Improved Houses rented-housing scheme which replaced the infamous
``Legoland'' plastic houses of the town's Southgate Estate.
q A MAN was detained by police yesterday after they spotted him waiting for the
Princess of Wales to leave the English National Ballet School.
It is understood he had been noticed at other public appearances by the
princess and that police were concerned that he could be a stalker.

LABOUR's concerted attempt to woo the City appears to have failed to convince
private investors, according to a new survey which shows that a majority plan
to divert funds into overseas equities in the event of a Labour election
victory.
The study carried out among 2500 private investors throughout the UK by
Cantrade Investment Management, part of the Union Bank of Switzerland Group,
shows that 70% expect a Labour election victory but that few (15%) trust New
Labour.
At present, about 78% have at least half their portfolio made up from UK
equities, however should Labour come to power they have indicated there would
be a dramatic shift from UK to overseas equities.
Only 12% predict a Conservative win, with 18% suggesting there could be a hung
Parliament.
Only 15% trust New Labour - 47% do not and 28% are undecided.
60% see politics at a fundamental influence on the stock market.
81% would change their investment policy should Labour win the election, with
56% increasing their overseas investmnts and 23% taking out more index-linked
gilts.
57% have yet to adjust their portfolio strategy to reflect the expectation of a
Labour election victory.
Mr Robert Brown, Cantrade deputy managing director, said that although private
investors clearly expected to see a Labour Government after the next election,
more than half had yet to adjust their investment policy accordingly, ``so the
stock market may not be discounting a Labour Government as much as the City
likes to think.''

Aberdeen 1, Kilmarnock 1
match abandoned
THE lights went out in a gloomy clash between Aberdeen and Kilmarnock last
night and ended the briefest of comebacks by local hero and multiple sclerosis
victim Brian Irvine.
With just 57 minutes played Pittodrie stadium was plunged into darkness.
Although emergency lighting came on there was no PA system in 75% of the ground
to enlighten the 8500 fans who had braved freezing weather to see the match.
Only the fans in the Richard Donald Stand were kept informed by a public
address system.
After 20 minutes police walked round the pitch announcing by loud-hailer that
the game had been abandoned. Spectators who retain their tickets will be
admitted to the rearranged game.
Aberdeen secretary Ian Taggart said the entire Pittodrie area had been blacked
out by a power failure.
``The referee Jim McGilvray gave us 15 minutes but said if it was going to be
significantly more than that he would have to abandon the game.
``It was very cold, the players had cooled off, and it would not have been fair
to them to put them back out.
``If spectators keep their ticket stubs they will be admitted to the rearranged
game and we will be contacting the Scottish League immediately to see when that
might be.''
He said it was the first abandonment because of a power failure for 14 years.
Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken said they were disappointed because, after losing
an early goal, they had equalised and were playing well when the power failure
struck.
He said, however, that Brian Irvine would be happy to get back into action
albeit for only two minutes and revealed it was a hamstring injury to John
Inglis which prompted the substitution.
His 120 seconds of first team football this season marked a milestone for
Irvine, who was diagnosed as suffering from MS in the close season.
However, he has overcome his initial mild attack and his reserve performances
won him a place on the bench last night and then, to a standing ovation, his
return to the first team.
Aberdeen fans were also assessing the club's new striker, Dean Windass, who had
played from the start but had little opportunity to make a major impact.
One of the most disappointed spectators will have been Spurs' manager Gerry
Francis, who had flown up from London with the object of his interest thought
to be teenager Stephen Glass.
Aberdeen won two corners in the first 90 seconds as they pushed forward against
Kilmarnock, who quickly revealed that attacking was not top of their priorities.
In seven minutes, Paul Bernard started a great move with Shearer back-heeling
his pass to Dodds, but as Shearer collected the return ball a linesman's flag
went up for offside.
In 15 minutes, Shearer did well to snatch a shot from a Grant flick into the
box but the ball went straight into Lekovic's arms.
An Inglis shot from a Glass pass in 22 minutes went just over the bar, and
Michael Watt awaited Kilmarnock's first effort at the Merkland Road goal.
Four minutes later he was stunned when an Ally Mitchell shot slid under him to
give Kilmarnock the lead.
In the visitors' first serious move forward, Gary Holt sent in a cross from the
left and Paul Wright almost got his head to it in the middle of the Aberdeen
defence, which was in disarray.
The ball slipped through to Mitchell on the right and his 12-yard shot easily
beat the keeper.
Two minutes later Kilmarnock burst through the Aberdeen defence again and Watt
took two attempts to save another Mitchell shot.
In 33 minutes Dodds passed to Bernard just outside the box and it took a great
save from Lekovic to deny him the equaliser, but as the first half drew to a
close slipshod play by Aberdeen let Kilmarnock make break after break.
In 50 minutes Whitworth became the first player to be booked after a foul on
Dodds. Just 60 seconds later Shearer equalised with a tremendous near-post
header from a Glass corner on the right.
In 53 minutes Lekovic failed to hold a Jess cross but the danger was cleared as
Aberdeen stepped up the pressure.
Irvine was just settling down to his midfield role when the lights went out.
ABERDEEN - Watt, Grant, Glass, Bernard, Inglis, Smith, Miller, Shearer,
Windass, Dodds, Jess. Substitutes - Hetherston, Stillie, Irvine.
KILMARNOCK - Lekovic, MacPherson, Black, Reilly, Whitworth, Anderson, Mitchell,
Connor, Wright, Brown, Holt. Substitutes - Hendry, Maskrey, Meldrum.
Referee - J McGilvray, Edinburgh.

CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE
ROUND-UP
FORMER England manager Bobby Robson was a disappointed man last night when his
Porto side, who needed to defeat Aalborg to have any chance of catching Nantes
and reach the quarter-final stage, were held to a 2-2 draw in Portugual.
Porto went a goal down after 10 minutes when Erik Bo Andersen scored, the home
side equalised in 62 minutes. However, the home side's fans were still
celebrating when Jens Christian Madsen scored again for the Danes. But Porto
did not stop going forward and their efforts were rewarded after 75 minutes
when Emerson scored again. But is was not to be for Robson's side.
In France, Nantes drew 0-0 with section winners Panathinaikos, and are through.
Blackburn hit the goal trail in no uncertain fashion at Ewood Park when a hat
trick from Mike Newell and a penalty from Alan Shearer put the English
champions on easy street against Rosenborg in a Group B match, with Steffen
Iversen scoring for the visitors.
However, there was a down side for Rovers when defender Paul Warhurst was sent
off in 51 minutes for a second bookable offence.
He tested the keeper with a drive but seconds later Warhurst took the long walk
to the dressing room following a challenge on Hoftun.
In the same section, Spartak Moscow, already through to the next round, beat
Legia Warsaw 1-0, but with the happenings at Blackburn in mind, the Poles are
safe.
Steaua Bucharest's Ion Vladoiu was sent off after 64 minutes against Juventus
in the same section as Rangers. The match in Romania ended 0-0.
Strikes from Marc Overmars and Ronald de Boer in the opening 22 minutes sent
Group D winners Ajax on their way to success against Ferencvaros in Holland.
Then just after the hour mark, Finnish internationalist Jari Litmanen put the
match well beyond the Hungarians' reach when he netted a double early in the
second half.
Real Madrid will qualify as runners-up from Group D.

CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE
ROUND-UP
REAL Madrid, Legia Warsaw, and Nantes completed the quarter-final line-up in
the European Cup last night as Ajax, the holders, underlined their status as
favourites.
The Dutch side beat Ferencvaros 4-0, with two goals from Finnish striker Jari
Litmanen, extending Ajax' record unbeaten European Cup run to 17 games.
The Group D winners now play Borussia Dortmund, while Real, 2-0 away winners
against Grasshopper Zurich, must face the 1985 champions, Juventus.
Raul Gonzalez, the 18-year-old striker who found the net twice in Real's latest
Spanish league match, set his side on their way and added another to make sure.
Polish champions Legia Warsaw, runners-up in Group B, play Panathinaikos, who
drew 2-2 with Bobby Robson's Porto last night, and Nantes take on Spartak
Moscow, whose 1-0 away win over Legia left them as the only team in the
Champions' League with a 100% record.
In England, Blackburn Rovers manager Ray Harford praised his players'
commitment after their 4-1 success against Rosenborg.
Rovers, who have disap-pointed in Europe, kept their best play for the last
match in this season's tournament, with Alan Shearer scoring with a penalty
before Mike Newell netted his first hat trick for the club.
The only disappointment for the home side was the sending off of Paul Warhurst.
``We were tentative at the start but I was delighted with our attitude and
application, especially when down to 10-men,'' said Harford.
``Goals change thinking and I was pleased with our third. We must have played
about 27 consecutive passes there.''
Meanwhile, Bordeaux went down 2-1 to Real Betis in their UEFA Cup third round
second leg clash in Spain - but reached the quarter-finals.

AMERICAN world No.1 Pete Sampras earned himself $762,500 for a day's work when
he cruised to a 6-1, 7-6 first-round victory over compatriot Patrick McEnroe at
the Grand Slam Cup in Munich yesterday.
After guiding the United States to their Davis Cup triumph last weekend, he can
increase his earnings in the world's richest tennis event to $2.12m by winning
the cup, which brings together the best performers from the four grand slam
events.
The Wimbledon champion won the first set with ease and although his form
slipped slightly in the second, he took the tiebreak 7-1.
Sampras earned $500,000 just for turning up in Munich following his victories
at Wimbledon and the US Open. The losers in the the next round, where Sampras
will play Croat Goran Ivanisevic, are guaranteed $262,500.
American Todd Martin booked his place in the quarter-finals with a 7-6, 6-4
victory over Spain's former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera.
q LYNDSAY Reilly faces the biggest test of her young life next week when the
talented teenager from Currie, Midlothian, jets to Florida to attempt to
qualify for the world junior championships.
The current under-16 and under-18 Scottish hardcourt champion will be playing
on an alien clay surface, but she has won several tournaments in North America
since starting a one-year scholarship several months ago.
She said: ``It's the biggest tournament of its kind in the world and I'm really
excited about it.''
q BRITAIN'S Clare Wood was knocked out in the second round of the Challenger
event in Paris yesterday, beaten 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 by American qualifier Angela

GOVERNMENT officials are to investigate claims of misinformation and
intimidation over an opt-out ballot at a school in Mr Tony Blair's constituency.
The decision brought a clash at Westminster, with Education Secretary Gillian
Shephard calling on the Labour leader to condemn the alleged behaviour of party
supporters in Hurworth, County Durham.
Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett hit back, accusing her of instigating
the inquiry for party-political reasons.
The row took a new twist last night when the head who made the complaints,
writing personally to Mr Blair and the Prime Minister, condemned Mrs Shephard's
intervention.
Mr Eamonn Farrar, head of Hurworth School, said he still wanted Government
action to ensure fair opt-out ballots in the future. However, after a
bitterly-fought local campaign, he said he did not want his school to be a
political football.
``The governors never asked for an investigation and we don't want one. We want
a line drawing under this now,'' he said.
Parents at Hurworth School voted two-to-one in a ballot counted earlier this
week not to apply to remove the school from the control of Durham County
Council. However, Mr Hurworth says he believes the ballot was swung by a
campaign of intimidation and misinformation by local Labour activists.
A spokeswoman for the Labour leader said last night: ``Tony Blair has no
evidence to stand up claims of intimidation. But if there were such things
going on, he entirely dissociates himself from them and anybody with any
evidence should present it to the inquiry.''

LABOUR in Europe yesterday gave its formal support to the French strikers in a
show of solidarity which could also embarrass Mr Tony Blair.
Veteran left-winger Alex Falconer, Euro-MP for Mid-Scotland and Fife, won
unanimous backing from the European Parliamentary Labour Party for a resolution
backing the industrial action which threatens the future of prime minister
Alain Juppe, and has provoked the worst street disorder for 30 years.
At the same time, the EPLP was split on how to vote in next week's debate in
the European Parliament on whether to approve a customs union with Turkey.
Mr Blair will be unhappy at his party in Europe being so divided on the issue
because, last week, he reportedly promised President Bill Clinton, who supports
the idea, that British Labour - with 62 Euro-MPs - would ease the controversial
trade deal with Turkey through the Strasbourg assembly.
However, Europe's 217-strong socialist group met in Brussels last night and
decided to approve the Turkish deal when the Strasbourg assembly votes on it
next week, but also demanded monitoring arrangements for human rights progress
and continuing democratic reforms.
The proposed agreement has passed all its hurdles in the EU except next week's
European Parliament vote.
Many European socialists are unhappy at the EU approving a deal which will earn
the Turks millions in new trade, while the Ankara government stands accused of
human rights abuses, especially against the Kurds.
Last night, one Euro-MP said of European Labour's reluctance to back the
leader: ``Tony Blair will be fuming about this. It seems we are always accused
of causing him trouble.''
Labour's Pauline Green, the London Euro-MP who leads the European socialists,
was at the meeting which endorsed backing for the French strikers, but there
was no word of whether she joined in the voting.
Mr Falconer made headlines earlier this year when he infuriated Mr Blair by
winning the EPLP's majority backing for keeping Clause 4.
His efforts earned him a scornful denunciation by the leader, who attacked the
EPLP after 32 of its members put their names to a newspaper advertisement
backing the retention of the clause - seen by some as an article of socialist
faith - which has since been jettisoned by New Labour.
Mr Blair attacked the EPLP for its ``infantile incompetence'' which, he said,
had blunted a party policy launch in Europe.
Mr Falconer's resolution backing the French strikers was adopted without
debate, according to Labour officials. It said that ``this EPLP, mindful of the
failure of Thatcherism, supports the French workers in their campaign to defend
their welfare state''.
Earlier, Mr Falconer had written to the French unions expressing his support in
their campaign to prevent welfare spending cuts.
He said: ``During the Maastricht debate, many of us warned that the convergence
criteria would lead to massive spending cuts, which would be unacceptable to
the people of Europe.
``Why should the rest of Europe put up with the disaster of the Thatcher
experiment, which has so patently failed us in Britain? The French, Germans,
and other people of Europe have only to look across the Channel to see the
chaos that the past 16 years of this nonsense has produced.
``In Britain, we have seen recently a growing mood of militancy. In view of the
anti-union laws in this country, it is important that workers combine
unofficially to resist the attack on our welfare state.
``Governments cannot tell workers to invest in private pension and insurance
schemes, when the same workers are being faced with wage cuts. It does not make
economic sense. I support the French people in their struggle and would
encourage all sections of the British working class to do likewise.''
Mr Falconer, 55, a former foundry worker, was a trade union shop steward at
Rosyth naval dockyard before entering the European Parliament. He is known to
be deeply unhappy with the rightwards drift of the Labour Party. There has been
speculation that he will announce his retirement before the next
Euro-elections, which are three-and-a-half years away.
q The parliament's European People's Party, which includes British
Conservatives, voted last night to approve the EU-Turkey deal. But the group
expressed dissatisfaction with Turkey's progress on human rights and said it
must be monitored.

<HEADLINE>Scots Tories challenged on fuel VAT vote</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S Tory MPs yesterday were challenged by Labour to explain why they
chose not to back a Finance Bill amendment that would have opened the way for a
reduction in the level of VAT on fuel from 8% to 5%.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson has written to each one demanding a
justification for an action he claims betrays Scottish households facing a
winter of home-heating bills.
In Tuesday night's votes on last week's Budget, the Government defeated an
amendment that would have forced a cut in the current rate of VAT on fuel,
which the Government failed to raise to 17.5% last year.
This proved that Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and the Government could
not be trusted on tax, Mr Robertson said. ``Only Labour stopped him voting VAT
on fuel up to 17.5% last year. On Tuesday night, he refused again to support
those Scottish households who rely on heating in the winter most,'' he said.
``Michael Forsyth is a world expert in hated taxes: first the poll tax and now
VAT on fuel. Labour's top priority is to reduce VAT on fuel from 8% to 5%. This
would save the average Scottish family #22 a year.''
In a letter sent to Scottish Tories including Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind, Mr Robertson said the Scottish people would want to know why they
voted against reducing VAT on fuel, but backed the abolition of inheritance and
capital gains tax. ``Is it not time that you explained these perverse
priorities?'' he said.
Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat MP Ray Michie criticised Scottish Tory MPs for
backing a Government Budget measure on hydrocarbon oils that will increase the
price of petrol by 3.5p per litre.
She said: ``The Tory Party claims to represent the interests of Scotland's
rural areas and yet they were quite happy to vote for a hike in petrol prices
which will have a disproportional impact upon the rural economy of Scotland.
``The Government's policy is aimed at topping up Treasury funds rather than
preserving the environment. Obviously, the Labour Party is still the party of
the cities and is not prepared to stand up for Britain's remote areas.''

YOUR editorial said, ``Scots in recent years have persisted in giving the
majority of their votes to any party but the one that sits in authority over
them'' (December 1).
Translated into plain English that means, ``All parties are minority parties in
Scotland''.
They have been since 1955, not by the machinations of Westminster but by the
will of the Scottish electorate in exercising their democratic right to vote
for the parties of their individual choice.
Only in the devolution-inflamed imagination of the Scottish media do Scotland's
voters wheel and turn in unison like flocks of electoral starlings, forming
coalitions against this or for that.
In the real world there is no political consensus in Scotland for any one
party, or against any one party. If Labour were in office today, that would
constitute a ``democratic deficit'' for the 61% of Scottish voters who voted
against Labour in the last General Election.
This minority party situation is not one that would be likely to be changed by
the setting up of a devolved Scottish parliament.
Notwithstanding a decorative frill of additional representation, the most
likely outcome would be the permanent ``democratic deficit'' of Labour in
office in Scotland on the basis of a minority vote, currently 39% of the total
- the transference of a ``democratic deficit'' to Edinburgh, possibly in
perpetuity.
Thanks to Michael Forsyth the devolution argument has lifted to a higher
intellectual level than in recent years. Let us try to keep it there by not
returning to the hyperbolical rubbish of the 1980s.
James Scott,
5 Turnberry Road, Glasgow.

WELL, I wasn't going to do any political point-scoring following this
celebration - by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and Scottish Opera - of
the life of Sir Alexander Gibson. But Dame Janet Baker, in her address to the
packed house at the Royal Concert Hall, started it, and I'm quite happy to pick
up the flag where she set it down.
All the areas of life important to Sir Alex were represented in that great
crowd last night, said Dame Janet: ``His family and friends, his colleagues,
the orchestra he was so closely associated with for many years, the opera
company he founded, and the Scottish audience he served for so many years.
``What hope have the arts in these dark and difficult times?'', she asked,
pointing - as a rallying call - to Sir Alex's commitments to ``excellence and
to Scottish musicians and singers, to whom his loyalty was unswerving''.
He was, she said, ``a marvellous influence on my own career, and on music
internationally''. And Dame Janet referred to ``the treasures he laid at the
feet of his audiences everywhere''.
Two of those treasures - the RSNO which he nurtured and Scottish Opera which he
founded - were onstage, with their current chief conductors, and in their
prime. Both of them - imminently Scottish Opera - are now endangered species,
and the very evidence of what they produced stands as a testimony to their
magnificence and a dire warning of what Scotland will lose should they go to
the wall or be diminished in any way. (And I hope that the dignitaries and
significant movers in the glitzy audience take note of the fact.)
What a display the companies turned on. First on was the explosive Russian,
Alexander Lazarev, who set the pace and the tempo for the night with a
blistering account of Sibelius's Finlandia with the RSNO. I recall, some years
ago, Sir Alex shaking his head in wonder at another Russian who did something
similar; he'd have done the same at Lazarev's scorching account, with the band
playing at white heat.
Then, without a single crunch of gears, the RSNO slipped into Viennese mode for
a momentous account of the first movement of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto
- weighty, controlled, and confident - with chief conductor Walter Weller and
the incomparable pianist John Lill. This great pianist produced for the
occasion an immaculate blend of concentration, poetry, and intellect; solid as
a rock, with Weller reading him like a book.
Weller then let the band off the leash in a stunning performance of Elgar's In
the South Overture, packed with brilliant solos from within the orchestra, and
shining as heroically and epically as one of Richard Strauss's great tone poems.
And then, in the second half, Scottish Opera, its orchestra, chorus, and music
director Richard Armstrong took the stage with extracts from Berlioz's The
Trojans (with soloists Jeffrey Lawton and Anne-Marie Owens) and - rousingly -
Wagner's Mastersingers.
Let's be succinct. Richard Armstrong has fashioned a very fine orchestra here:
extremely well-balanced, with a compact wind section, softly burnished brass,
and - from the strings - a remarkable clarity of ensemble. Their playing, light
and mellow, was heartwarming. And I'm sorry once again to stick it up the noses
of the accountants and politicians (like hell I am) but we really should not
lose this opera orchestra. It's the only one we've got; bloody well pay for it
or lose part of your cultural fabric. The heritage of Sir Alex Gibson deserves
nothing less.

LAST year's Christmas entertainment by the Young Vic's artistic director, Tim
Supple, produced one of the treats of the season - Grimm's Fairy Tales in a
story-telling version that, paradoxically, became a celebration of total
theatre.
A knockout for young and old alike, it must have seemed a hard act to follow.
But Supple's festive fare for this year runs it very close - a dramatisation of
Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book that, if tending to be busy where the former
relied on subtle pacing, once again uses its slender resources with terrific
imagination and great satisfaction.
Using every aspect of the Young Vic's in-the-round space, Supple makes
Kipling's tale of young Mowgli and his adoption by the Seeonee Wolf Pack a
gripping adventure tale that, last night at least, kept two-year-olds on the
edge of their seats way beyond their bedtime.
Supple's version interestingly also lets us see the environmentalist and
conservationist in Kipling. ``We be of one blood,'' says Ronny Jhutti's young
``manling'' man-cub (as his adopted family call him) rehearsing the mantra of
jungle law. That Kipling felt huge sympathy with all living creatures from
whom, as humans, we could learn a good deal comes over with unusual clarity and
force.
Most of all though this, like the Grimm Tales, reinforces the art of theatrical
story-telling. Melly Still's red sawdust ring and arching bridge, and Adrian
Lee's wonderful Indian-based music is all the actors need to create their world
while as mother and father wolf, bear, tiger, the howling Bandar-log monkeys,
Kaa the python and the rest, they inhabit their animalistic selves with a
beauty and economy Peter Brook would surely applaud.

LESLEY DUNCAN talks to a remarkable octogenarian about a new book in which she
relates the experiences of going back to the troubled land of her birth
TO HAVE a new book published within days of one's ninetieth birthday is an
unusual distinction. It's one that can be claimed by Eugenie Fraser, whose
sequel to her best-selling The House by the Dvina appears next week.
That first book described Mrs Fraser's idyllic childhood in Archangel, in
northern Russia, before the First World War and the Bolshevik Revolution
destroyed traditional Russian civilisation and values - as well as millions of
the country's citizens.
The material was intended originally for Mrs Fraser's sons. She was encouraged
to publish it after her description of her Russian great-grandfather's
unorthodox acquisition of wife and mother-in-law (he bought them) caught the
fancy of her lecturer in an extramural class at Edinburgh University.
Mrs Fraser, the daughter of a Russian father and a mother from Broughty Ferry,
was fortunate to escape back to Britain as a young teenager with her mother and
brother in 1920. But her ailing father was left behind, as well as an extended
family of Tolstoyan dimensions, including the admirable babushka, her Russian
grandmother.
Mrs Fraser's new book, The Dvina Remains, tells the story of her returns to
Russia, in pre and post-glasnost days. It also - through the letters of her
namesake cousin, Evgenie - fills in the often painful family history of those
dark decades of communism.
In the cultured but cosy ambience of her Morningside flat in Edinburgh, and
with kilted husband Ronald in solicitous attendance, Eugenie Fraser defies
time. A bright-eyed, slender woman, she's at once imposing and approachable,
with a mind and memory of undiminished brightness. A slight deafness is her
only concession to age.
She's a little worried about the unorthodox format of her new book, with her
own reminiscences sandwiching a central section of her cousin's letters. She
shouldn't be. The inherent interest of the material transcends any
organisational gaucheness.
The opening chapter deals with her first visit, in 1972, to her native country
after 52 years, many of them spent in India. It was not a happy experience. She
was, as any sentient outsider would be, critical of what she saw - from the
veneration accorded the stuffed Lenin in his Red Square mausoleum to the
devastation and suffering endured by St Petersburg under 70 years of communism.
And at a personal level she met rebuffs from Russians and fellow travellers, no
doubt because as a native-born Russian and fluent speaker of the language she
was a potentially dangerous person to know in these still paranoid times.
Particularly sad was her abortive effort to meet some of her relations in St
Petersburg (still Leningrad then). A woman cousin took to the country to avoid
her. But from this non-event sprang a poignant correspondence with the woman's
brother Evgenie - a noble, gaunt-looking man in the family album that Mrs
Fraser produces.
``I only knew him as a child,'' Mrs Fraser recalls. ``He was like a little
brother to me.'' That early rapport was revived more than 50 years later in his
eloquent letters. Mrs Fraser takes them from a plastic bag - a huge sheaf of
airmail envelopes, all carefully annotated on the front with the theme of their
contents. She has translated them freely.
The letters touch on harrowing matters, including the execution and suicide of
two male relations - tainted in Stalinist eyes with having served with White
Russian forces in the civil war - and the exile of others to Siberia. (Several
family members also died of starvation in wartime Leningrad.)
The letters also offer more humdrum insights into the privations of ordinary
Russians under communism. There are moments of tragicomedy - as when a
razor-sharpener is sent as a present from Scotland and provides a short-lived
business for Mrs Fraser's blind father and young Evgenie.
Sadly, Eugenie and Evgenie never met as adults. Evgenie was dead before Eugenie
returned again to the land and place of her birth in 1990. This new visit was
prompted indirectly by the success of her first book, which as well as being
translated into Swedish, Dutch, and Finnish has a transatlantic edition. An
American woman with the splendid handle of Mrs Charles Bragg II presented a
copy to the Archangel library. Invitations to its author ensued.
Glasnost had made its mark and this time, and on a subsequent visit to
Archangel in 1992, Mrs Fraser was feted. She was also the subject of television
programmes.
Was she glad to have returned to Russia? ``Very glad; overwhelmed,'' she
replies. There is a qualification, though. She had hoped that some schoolfriend
might get in touch, especially after the television broadcasts, but ``I never
met a single soul my own age - I was too old for them!''
q The Dvina Remains by Eugenie Fraser is published next Thursday by Mainstream
at #12.99.

Keith Bruce talks to budding writers about to take their work centre-stage
IF THERE is to be any addressing the complaints of Scottish playwrights David
Greig, Stephen Greenhorn, Iain Heggie et al that their vocation is not taken
sufficiently seriously, then there is only one place to start.
The Scottish Young Playwrights' festival has been running as an offshoot of
Scottish Youth Theatre for almost as long as SYT itself. Now biennial as part
of the company's established cycle of activity, the invitation to budding
writers for the stage was this year promoted through the pages of The Herald.
Of some 40 completed applications, a shortlist of four was selected. Aged from
16 to 21, they are all male, but you can forget any thoughts of sexism. The
judging panel, including playwright Lara Jane Bunting, herself a graduate of
the scheme, were all female.
So too are the two writers - Vivian Adams and Susan McClymont - who are working
with the winners this week in an intensive process of bringing their scripts
towards the stage. Based at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, the
writers are working with directors Robin Wilson and Andrew Dawson and 20
students from the drama school's second year. Although the focus of the work is
firmly on the script, it will result in rehearsed readings of 20 minutes from
each of the pieces at the Old Athenaeum a week today as part of SYT's winter
festival.
The quartet could hardly be more varied. Douglas Maxwell is from Girvan, 21 and
a Stirling University graduate who wrote a stage adaptation of Hogg's
Confessions of a Justified Sinner as his part of his honours English degree,
and formed the student musical society, staging Grease and West Side Story. He
applied on a coupon from The Herald.
Suggest to him that this project lacks the cynicism often encountered in the
professional stage, and he feels compelled to inject it. He claims to be
resisting the temptation to get a job, being reluctant to adopt the
Government-approved label of ``graduate job-seeker''.
``All the new playwrights and philosophers are out there wearing badges that
say: `My name is Bob, how can I help you'.''
Gavin Sayers, 18 and from Dundee, is hunched in drainpipe black jeans and long
black hair. He read about the competition in The Big Issue. He is pretty clear
about being unemployed, and less than impressed, in his meek way, with the film
and televsion companies who have returned his writing without any indication of
why it has been rejected. His ambitions run to independent film production and
Orwell, Steinbeck, and Pinter are among those he admires.
``It's uplifting to be taken seriously as a writer,'' he confesses, shyly.
James McNulty is 19 and from Kilmarnock and eager to consign to the past his
time with the Palace Youth Theatre, although they staged his Caveat Emptor. An
admirer of Chris Hannan, Iain Banks, Samuel Beckett, and James Joyce, he is now
at Glasgow University reading theatre studies and philosophy.
His next work, Tricolour, will feature at the Bedlam's Febfest in Edinburgh,
and it and the SYT piece, The Sunmaid, are set for future performance at the
Cottier Theatre.
``This is so useful because it is the opportunity to work and speak with
professionals. After the first read through I was asked a lot of questions and
that helped me get things straight in my own head. This time it is the emphasis
that has shifted rather than the script that has changed, but it will make a
huge difference to what I do in the future.''
Bram Gieben is a 16-year-old polymath for James Gillespie's school, who has
come to writing from acting classes with SYT, has done a spot of directing at
school, and plans to go the RSAMD unless someone wants to sponsor him to go
film school in New York. (Just send the cheque to The Herald and I'll forward
it.) Although he is too young to be permitted to see any of his films, he
claims Tarantino as an influence, alongside Canadian Brian Drader, whose work
he heard at a rehearsed reading at the Traverse.
His piece, Billy Joe, is a short David Lynch-esque tale of a Scots family
Robertson in an 80s housing scheme. A tale of mortality, urban violence, and
abortion, he maintains, based on the Bobby Gentry hit Ode to Billy Joe, which
he should be too young to know.
That piece and Maxwell's The Chameleon's Play are paired for one group of 10
actors working with McClymont and Dawson, while Wilson and Adams work with The
Sunmaid and Sayers's The Trouble With Mr Charlie. The latter is about a chap
whose imaginary childhood friend returns to him and leads him to confront the
terrors of his past, while Maxwell's is a theatrical farce that involves the
killing of Oscar Wilde and acknowledges the influence of Dario Fo, Joe Orton,
and Dad's Army.
McClymont says that the process which the young writers are going through in a
mere 10 days is similar to the reality of bringing new work to the stage with a
professional theatre company.
``I'm dead jealous because the actors really like these plays,'' she added.
Adams says they are putting the process of years into a nutshell, but if
Scotland wants a reputation for its playwrighting it will have to take young
writers seriously.
``What is important is that what is learned is theatrical. To talk of structure
and objectives is not imposing a formula - it has to be opening doors and
giving the writers the tools to get across their next idea even more strongly.''
Just as interesting will be the question of which of these four diverse talents
will produce the piece about the four young writers who are thrown together and
feted at a young age, having their talent nurtured by enthusiastic
professionals towards that all-important first night. On the other hand,
perhaps not.
n Scottish Young Playwrights, 7.30pm Thursday December 14, Old Athenaeum,
Glasgow.

At this season of impending media overload it is traditional for the August
Economist newspaper, taking a break from its usual demands that the Govemment
should slash spending here or squeeze budgets there to produce a magazine
previewing the year ahead - a kind of Old Moore's Alamanack with long words and
bar charts.
Interestingly, in recent times the paper has made repeated efforts to predict
that next year, for certain sure, something  sensational will happen vis-a-vis
Scotland  and the constitutional issue. Each year, like most  in the punditry
profession, it is entirely mistaken. Shame.
With that in mind, perhaps, the Economist's  god-like commentators have been
more canny this time round. Outlining the various positions of the party - no,
we don't propose to go through all that again - it tries a novel approach.
The real battle in 1996, it states, " will be for the English hearts and minds.
In the run-up to the next election, can the Tories persuade enough Englishmen
that Scottish devolution means Scottish independence (and that would be a bad
thing)?"
Now why didn't Michael Forsyth think of that? Our prediction for 1996 is that
this amazing new theory of self-determination might just qualify for nomination
as the West Leicestershire Question.
With one voice
Lord but that Christmas spirit is catching. Or as the Scots Independent, "the
only true voice of Scotland", puts it in its latest patriotic issue: "The Board
and Editor of the Scots Independent wish all of their readers, regardless of
political persuasion, the Compliments of the Season." And God bless Tony Blair?
Hard to swallow
The evil cunning that goes into the drugs trade sometimes passes all belief.
Take, for example, the case of hapless Paul MacPherson convicted at Inverness
Sheriff Court last week for possession of 1773 of amphetamines with intent to
supply.
In his defence, MacPherson's agent told the court that his client was "quite
green" and not "dealing in the strict sense".  The drugs he explained were
offered on a sale or return basis.
Relieved of 25
Still in the courts, a Stranraer man has been fined 25 at the local sheriff
court.  His offence? Urinating in the street. Tush, so to speak.
Worse than that, the villain committed the offence "in a way likely  to cause
annoyance".  We wait information on the polite way.
Money laundering
Ignoring the fairly obvious fact  that, what with British Europhobes, French
strikes, Italian deficits, and so forth, monetary union may never come to pass,
the Benelux countries have settled on their choice of a name for a future
European currency.
With startling wit and oodles of imagination, Belgium, the Netherlands, and
Luxembourg suggest "Euro" as the name for the dosh of the future when European
leaders make a decision on December 15-16.  The Benelux choice arises,
apparently, because the Germans oppose "Ecu", believing it has "negative
connotations" after the recent monetary instability of recent years.
What the diary wants to know is why anyone thinks "Euro" has a positive image.
Robbed of childhood
In California, meanwhile, one Mrs Billie Jean Matay is suing Disneyland after
she, her daughter and three grandchildren were robbed at gunpoint in the car
park.
Understandably, perhaps, Mrs Matay believes security at the park was lax. But
what really infuriated her, according to the lawsuit she filed this week, was
that while being questioned about the incident by guards her grandchildren were
allowed  to see Disney characters disrobe and "traumatised" by "the reality
that the Disney characters were, in fact, make-believe".
Unlike , we hasten to add, the California legal system.
Still in the Land of the Free, we heard tell of the two firemen and six
volunteers suspended from the bridge in Seat Pleasant, Michegan, after being
involved in a brawl.  The heroes were fighting over who should carry the big
hose into a burning house.
With good cause
Keen to demonstrate that the running of the National Lottery is something more
than just a licence to print millions, Camelot,  the organisers , have taken to
handling out little leaflets  explaining what a wonderful job "you" (that's me
and you) do for good causes every time "you" buy a ticket.
In a rather clever marketing wheeze , the leaflets distributed in Scotland
mention only the Scottish causes - thus side stepping  the rather well-founded
claim that London has done better than most places from the gaming tax - and
might just leave the unwary with the impression that all the dosh is going to
projects in Pollockshields, Plockton and Kirkcaldy.
Equally, the thing somehow entirely overlooks any mention of the profits made
by the organisers themselves.  But as Camelot would doubtless put it, it's all
in good cause.
Mis-herd
There may be older jokes, but we can't think of one.  Teacher  to class "What
do you call a group of angels?"
Little girl at the back: "A herd , miss!"
Teacher: "Whatever gave you that idea?"
Small girl: "It's the carol we're learning, miss!"
Teacher:"What carol?"
Small girl: "Hark! The herd of angel sing."
Worth its weight
Finally, for the Christmas gift that would best express your deepest feelings
for the woman you love, we direct your attention to a sale of dolls, teddy
bears, textiles, trains tinplate toys and so  forth to be held at Phillips the
auctioneers in Edinburgh on Friday.
There, we hear, a "stocky little lady known by collectors as ' the little
wrestler' because of her chubby figure and shapely legs with moulded boots...
is looking for a new home". Just 800-1000 for the stocky lady in your life.
