GLASGOW'S shortage of business park and modern industrial space is
continuing to boost demand for property in Cumbernauld. The expanding
Broadwood Business Park has attracted Atlantech Technologies as its
latest tenant. The company is paying #12 per sq ft for a 6000 sq ft open
plan office property in the 33,000 sq ft phase one of the business park.
To match the company's expansion programme, an additional option has
been agreed which will enable Atlantech to lease a further 6000 sq ft
within the next eighteen months. If the option is taken up, phase one
will have been fully let. ScottishPower was the first occupant with a
21,000 sq ft unit, also rented at #12 per sq ft.
The sole letting agent for Broadwood is Grimley, while Atlantech was
represented by DTZ Debenham Thorpe. Guy Thorley of Grimley predicts
further expansion at the park, with construction of a new building due
to start early next month.
''We've had a lot of inquiries from Scottish companies interested in
locating to Broadwood, but most of them are looking for short-term
leases or break options. We're trying to hold them off by setting a
minimum of a 15-year lease, but we're also talking to Dunbartonshire
Enterprise about the possibility of developing some sort of scheme which
would meet these short- term needs and help to grow companies into the
larger units.''
He believes that Broadwood is poised for success, largely as a result
of the lack of alternative space in Glasgow city centre. ''There is a
psychological barrier in persuading people to move out of the city to
the new town, but it is only 20 minutes from the city centre via the
Stepps bypass.''
Atlantech specialises in providing network management systems for
telecommunications networks, and recently attracted a #2 million
investment to accelerate development and to launch AccessVision, the
Company's flagship software platform.
When complete, Broadwood Business Park will offer some 250,000 sq ft
of business space overlooking a newly created loch on a 20-acre site. It
forms part of a larger #50 million development of business, retail,
housing and leisure elements stretching across a 200-acre site and is
the result of a partnership between the Walker Group (Scotland) Ltd,
Cumbernauld Development Corporation, and Dunbartonshire Enterprise.

STERLING ended off its best levels for the day as the dollar struggled
to extend gains made in the immediate aftermath of the G-7 meeting in
Washington.
The Group of seven industrial nations voiced their concern in a
communique about recent currency movements which have gone beyond the
levels justified by underlying economic conditions.
Positive comments about the dollar were made by a number of those
attending the meeting, including Bundesbank president, Hans Tietmeyer.
There is a possibility the Germans will cut their interest rates just as
Britain appears on the brink of raising its base rate.
The prospect of higher UK rates sooner rather than later underpins the
pound, and yesterday it rose 0.6 on a trade-weighted basis to 84.7.
Against the German mark it gained almost over a pfennig to DM2.2185
but against the recovering dollar it was a bit weaker at $1.6103.

Half-time results
MURRAY Johnstone said the net assets of its Murray Split Capital Trust
fell 9.8% to #23.1m during the six months to February 28, slightly more
than the All-Share index, which dropped 8.6% over the same period.
The total return on net assets fell 7.7%, more than the 6.9% decline
in the All-Share Total Return index.
The trust, launched four years ago, has three categories of shares,
income, capital, and zero dividend Preference, and its initial limited
life expires in 1998.
Glasgow-based Murray Johnstone said the portfolio of its split capital
trust benefitted from overweight holdings in the buoyant gas, food
manufacturing and life assurance sectors during the six months to
February.
But its net value was dragged down by a poor showing in the general
manufacturing and distribution sectors.
Murray Johnstone said 92% of the trust's assets are UK listed
securities, 6% are gilts and 2% are cash.
Earnings per income share fell to 4.14p during the six months to
February, from 4.61p in the year ago period, but the second quarterly
dividend, payable on July 3, was kept at the first quarter level of
2.65p.

BERKELEY House has been sold for #4m in Glasgow's biggest office
investment deal this year.
The premises at 285 Bath Street have been bought by Rover Group
Trustees Limited. The #4.025 million price for the five-storey, 25,780
sq ft, building reflects a 7.85% yield. It was sold by an institutional
client of Gooch &amp; Wagstaff.
The purchaser was represented by Legal and General Investment Managers
Limited and chartered surveyors Ryden.
Jim Shankland, managing partner of Ryden's Glasgow office, said:
''This sale re-emphasises the resurgence of the Glasgow office market
and underlines institutional confidence in city centre office
investments.''
Berkeley House has an annual rental income of #325,245. Tenants
include AXA Equity &amp; Law Life Assurance plc, NCM Credit Insurance Ltd,
and solicitors Robin Thompson &amp; partners.
Meanwhile, agents Hillier Parker warn that structural changes to the
economy are still causing ''substantial disruption to the property
cycle'' and holding back rental growth.
The firm's market review of the first three months of this year says
that over-supply from the excesses of the late 1980's boom still
overshadows the letting market, and that the driving force for
businesses will be to continue to remain competitive by reducing costs,
particularly fixed costs.
John Campbell, senior partner of Hillier Parker Scotland, says:
''Over-supply is a local issue. We will therefore see a wide divergence
in the rental value growth prospect of different locations. On the
whole, investment yields in Scotland are holding firm for the best
properties. Yields for prime investments with blemishes, secondary
investments and over-rented properties are continuing to rise.''
Some areas are seeing signs of improvement in the letting market, but
there is a lack of supply of the right type of property.
''There is certainly an air of optimism among occupiers, funds,
developers and consultants, which has not been evident for many years,''
the report concludes.

FIFTY Scottish independent film production companies will gather in
Glasgow tomorrow to discuss growth -- and the subject matter of the
seminar, being organised jointly by the Glasgow Development Agency and
Scottish Broadcast and Film Training Ltd, will sum up the confident
attitude of the Scottish broadcasting industry.
Several initiatives taken by those involved in the industry, including
the pilot Glasgow Television Development Fund and the separate Glasgow
and Edinburgh producers development initiatives, are beginning to bear
fruit.
John McVay, chief executive of Scottish Broadcast and Film Training,
sums it up when he says: ''In Scotland we have got things together. In
London they are jealous of the initiatives we have in place up here. We
have the advantage of being a small community that works together.''
John McVay has seen the entertainment business from a number of
different angles, starting off as a sax and keyboard player with local
bands before moving into record production. He successfully moved across
to film production and for a spell ran a course in Edinburgh training
disadvantaged groups to give them the opportunity to enter the
broadcasting industry.
Only months since its launch the latest pilot project, the Glasgow
Television Development Fund, has already had some success. The fund of
#30,000 is a soft loan arrangement backed by the Glasgow Development
Agency and the City Council which can give loans of up to #5000 towards
the development costs of pilot programmes made by production companies
based in the city.
The fund's first award was to Wark Clements, the independent
production company run by Kirsty Wark and husband Alan Clements, towards
the cost of producing a pilot show, Elaine with Attitude, for
consideration by Channel 4 as a replacement for the Oprah Winfrey show.
The Scottish pilot, which features Elaine C Smith, has been
shortlisted by the television station for consideration along with two
others.
Kirsty Wark was enthusiastic about the new fund, saying: ''It is vital
for the growth of Scottish television companies, particularly in the
independent sector, that we look outside Scotland for work. Our future
lies with getting programmes made which can go out on the national
networks as well as being produced for home consumption.''
John McVay, who manages the fund, says: ''We have already made a
second award and another application is being considered.''
There are around 120 independent production companies in Scotland
employing in the region of 2000 people, and John McVay believes that the
industry in Scotland is now ''vibrant''.
To help companies find new markets a producers development initiative
was launched in both Glasgow and Edinburgh to help fund the cost of
travel to international seminars and events.
The Glasgow initiative was launched with #20,000, once again by the
GDA and the City Council, and in the past year 18 companies have been
helped with up to 50% of the cost of travelling to an event.
Initiative funding assisted Scottish film producer Peter Broughan as
he travelled round seeking financial support for the Rob Roy film.
The industry has changed considerably in recent years with the numbers
employed directly by TV companies such as Scottish Television and
Grampian and also the BBC falling dramatically.
''An estimated 60% of people in the industry are now freelance,'' says
John McVay. This is highlighted in the recently published Scottish
Screen Data Digest.
Between 1989 and 1993 the number of employees at Scottish Television
fell from 709 to 350 while at Grampian staffing levels fell from 316 to
189. Meanwhile the number of independent production companies rose from
74 in 1992 to 102 last year, and they are now thought to number around
120.
''We are responsible for providing professional training for the
industry,'' explains John McVay, ''as the various companies realised
that an industry-wide body had to be created to ensure that the skills
needed were still available in the future.''
But John McVay is poised to move into a new field of training aimed at
those responsible for running independent production companies, which is
why their seminar, being held in the Hutchesons Hall, Glasgow, tomorrow
night, is entitled ''Thinking About Growth?''
''The seminar will be chaired by Alex Graham, joint managing director
of Wall to Wall Television, and guest speakers will include Michael
Pilsworth of Chrysalis Visual Entertainment and Annie Stogdale, business
manager of Antelope (UK) Ltd.''

RECENTLY I read 60 cv's on the same professional vacancy. It took just
over four hours. The standard was consistently high -- cv presentation
is becoming an art form in its own right.
At different times over the past six years I have worked through this
type of pre-selection exercise. But apart from the standard of cv
presentation improving, what else has changed? Here are some
observations:
* An increase in the number of credible candidates who have
experienced redundancy at least once in their careers (in this case
about 40%).
* An increase in the number who have been self-employed or contract
workers within their professions.
* A decrease in candidates who have been with the same firm for six
years or more.
* An increase in the number giving information about their commitment
to personal development action.
All this serves as a reminder (if one were needed) that the world of
work and the nature of people's careers is changing both rapidly and
fundamentally. The psychological contract between employer and employee
has traditionally been one of security in return for loyalty. This has
changed in just about every sector you can think of.
What then is the basis of the new contract between work to be done and
those who can do it?
The increased volume and complexity of change within the business
environment is readily apparent. The need for organisation agility
becomes essential when faced with new market conditions, technological
advances and keen competition.
My colleagues on the technical process side of ''Business Process
Re-engineering'' tell me that there are no longer any sacred cows which
presumably might be applied to BPR itself some day. To put it another
way, everything is up for grabs.
If strategy needs to change then processes and systems will need to be
redefined and this in turn is likely to have implications for the
required numbers and skill-mix of people.
Traditional, defined boundaries between jobs are becoming fuzzy. It is
increasingly the case that people or teams work towards a set of
objectives rather than carry out a detailed job description.
Thus organisations have less of a need for a predictable supply of
labour. They are increasingly looking for a leaner, fitter,
technologically supported core with flexible access to those who can
pick up their ad hoc needs as required. This is the area where contract,
part-time, or consultancy work then performs.
A typical example of changing company perspectives has to be in
banking -- at one time the place to be for a secure and steady
existence. In recent years how many banks have announced new strategies,
introduced new technologies, down-sized their people and generally moved
in ways which would previously have been considered unusual in their
sector? After all, 100,000 traditional jobs have disappeared in banks
and building societies in the last six years.
My eldest son is coming to the end of second year at secondary school.
This is the first time that he must make a choice of subjects which will
eventually shape part of the platform on which he builds his career --
or at least the first of his careers.
People in today's job market can expect to have about eight jobs in
their career. Those leaving school this year can expect three or four
different careers and will be more likely to experience redundancy as a
matter of course. Leaving education with a good set of grades or, later
on, a degree is only half of the battle.
There is also the need for a broader range of skills and mind-set.
This month's report of a survey of 12 Organisation for Economic
Co-operation countries highlighted the importance of self-confidence and
communications skills as part of education.
You could add to that self-awareness, self-development, and the
capacity for self-management. This is the nub. There will be no fairy
godmothers in the personnel department -- the emphasis is on people
taking responsibility for and ownership of their own career.
In short, the flexibility to adapt as skill requirements change will
be essential and the ability to network will be a positive advantage.
For those with careers at present there are always options to be
weighed. For example, can I enhance performance in this job? Can I
change direction within this company? Should I change organisation?
Should I think about doing my own thing?
Sometimes the choice does not exist or is taken away as part of a
job-cutting exercise. This can be initially traumatic but, according to
those who offer career counselling, it can be an opportunity for an
entire reappraisal of what a person's life objectives are or what skills
they possess which could be transferred to other areas.
This way of thinking may become a prerequisite for ongoing career
management and not merely something that is brought into sharp focus at
times of crisis.
For educationalists there is something about preparing people for a
challenging, changing, ambiguous world of work.
For companies there is a need to manage expectations around what
employment actually means and to encourage an ethos of individual
ownership or careers coupled with commitment and lifelong learning.
For the individual it is about accepting ownership of a career which
may be less about long service and more about developing and adapting
skills to changing market demands.
As for my 60 cv's? They are already part of all this and, for one of
them, their next change is just around the corner.

NELSON Roberston will step down as chief executive of the Perth-based
insurance giant General Accident at the end of this year after reaching
the group's standard retirement age of 62.
General Accident said Mr Robertson would be succeeded by his current
deputy, Bob Scott, 53, who is also a director of the group.
Mr Scott, who has spent most of his insurance career in New Zealand
and Australia, moved to the UK in 1990 and became deputy chief executive
of General Accident in June last year.
This is the second major change at the top of General Accident this
year.
Sir Alick Rankin was appointed deputy chairman of the group in January
and is being groomed to take over from the present chairman, Lord
Airlie, when he steps down in April 1997.
Sir Alick, 60, resigned as chairman of brewers Scottish &amp; Newcastle
and distribution and plant hire specialists Christian Salvesen to take
on the General Accident job.
General Accident said Mr Robertson would also give up his directorship
of the company when he steps down on December 31.

SEVERAL Massey Ferguson tractors have found a new lease of life in the
factory where they were originally made, thanks to the skill of
Kilmarnock College's training unit.
The unit, set up in 1991 to provide youth and adult training courses,
concentrates on delivering ''on the job'' training on practical, income
generating projects. One of these involved the refurbishment of
passenger trolleys and tractors for the Loudoun Castle Theme Park in
Galston.
The trolleys, and the tractors which pull them, were purchased from a
theme park in England and brought to the training unit's premises in the
former Massey Ferguson factory where they were stripped down,
refurbished and repainted.
The unit's first contract for the Loudoun Castle Theme Park was to
provide 200-metres of wrought-iron railing. ''We had to win this in a
tender situation,'' stresses training manager Rod Nelson, ''and after
that we gained four or five other contracts for the provision of further
wrought-iron work and the refurbishment of the trolleys and tractors.
Now we are actively seeking new contracts for the forthcoming year, so
that we can continue giving practical training to our students and
supplement our income from Enterprise Ayrshire.''
The unit has a total of nine staff. Apart from Rod Nelson there are
three supervisory staff who look after the trainees and teach them
practical skills, three training officers responsible for interviewing
and recruiting the trainees and two administrative staff. The unit
caters for between 160 and 180 trainees. All of them are treated exactly
as if they were in a job, with strong emphasis on good timekeeping and
other work-related disciplines.
If trainees obtain jobs before completing a course, the unit tries to
retain them as employed trainees. ''This means they can continue to
attend the college on a day release basis and obtain a Scottish
Vocational Qualification,'' explained Rod Nelson.
Courses are offered in welding, fabrication, vehicle maintenance,
caring, agriculture and horticulture. The unit actively promotes equal
opportunities and Rod Nelson is quick to point out that girls are being
trained in welding, fabrication and vehicle maintenance -- areas
traditionally the preserve of males.
The majority of trainees are young adults on the Skillseekers
Programme. This runs for two years and leads to a Scottish Vocational
Qualification or SVQ. The trainees come to the unit via careers offices
or direct from school. Provided a trainee in Ayrshire is under 25 by the
time he or she completes a level 2 SVQ, he or she is eligible for
Skillseekers.
The unit also offers courses to adult trainees who have been out of
work for six months under the Training For Work programme. ''The
majority of our trainees come from the long-term unemployed,'' commented
Rod Nelson, ''but we can also cater for people who have been made
redundant and wish to retrain. Recently we have had a number of people
in their fifties training to be vehicle mechanics.''
As part of its vehicle maintenance training programme the unit has
refurbished a Porsche and is currently working on one of the only two
amphibious cars in the UK. ''Generally we buy cars from the trade and
the car market, do them up and sell them,'' explained Rod Nelson. ''We
also service vehicles for college staff and their friends, and so
impressed was the managing director of Enterprise Ayrshire with the work
going on here, that he recently sent us his cherished MG -- a
collector's item -- to be retuned.''
Not surprisingly, trainees on vehicle maintenance courses are highly
successful in finding jobs with garages and vehicle service workshops.
The same is also true of trainees who attend courses in caring, with
most of those completing courses finding employment in the residential
care or nursing home sector.
The unit has BS5750 status not only for its training programmes, but
also for textile production, although this part of the operation is
temporarily on hold. It took 15 months to obtain BS5750 and Rod Nelson
pointed out that while all training units are required to have reached
this standard by Local Enterprise Companies, it offers many positive
advantages. ''Going for BS5750 highlights any weaknesses and enables you
to remove them. It also motivates staff and helps them to work together
for a common purpose, so that the end result is an improvement in the
quality of training the unit delivers.''
Rod Nelson sees the unit continuing to develop and future plans
include the establishment  of a construction unit for the manufacture of
garden furniture.

CUSTODY is a rather shadowy part of the securities industry but one
which is vital for active pension funds and fund managers.
The sector is going through something of a consolidation, leading to a
smaller number of larger players, at the same time as more and more
institutions are out-sourcing this activity.
The Royal Bank of Scotland claims to be the largest operator from its
new London offices where the business has grown rapidly as it has sought
to widen the services its offers. But Lloyds Bank is set to come nearer
to the leaders as a result of its purchase of the custody side of its
rival National Westminster for #16.9m.
Custody relates to the safekeeping of assets, either in paper form in
vaults or, increasingly, in computer memories, so the probity and
financial strength of the custodian are paramount. It also involves
keeping track of the shareholdings of institutions and organising
settlement of investment deals and related services such as the
collection of dividends, internationally as well as in the UK.
Once a fund manager has placed an order with a stockbroker the custody
service can take over. If it is a purchase it arranges payment, in
foreign currency if it is an overseas deal, and collection of the shares
concerned or if a sale it collects payment and surrenders shares. So it
is easy to see why the banks dominate the business.
It has been a fiercely competitive market in recent years but capacity
is now being absorbed as more institutions out-source their
requirements. The move towards the Crest paperless trading system is
encouraging this trend as it will eventually lead to settlement in under
five days.
Such a short settlement period means market-makers will have to make
more use of stock lending to balance their books. An existing holder
will lend stock for a fee to market-makers who will return the shares
when they are no longer required. This is a value-added service custody
firms are well placed to provide. Another is the collection of data
which the fund manager presents to pension performance trackers such as
WM Group of Edinburgh.
The Maxwell scandal, where the custody obligations were abused, has
drawn attention to the need for more regulatory control. One problem is
that custody is not covered by the Financial Services Act, and the
Securities and Investments Board is expected to come out with proposals
shortly.
Some fund managers have objected, saying it is not necessary if they
stick with the big banks and will only add to costs. So it is possible
the SIB may content itself with a code of practice.
Custody services require investment in information technology and this
is driving consolidation into a smaller number of large operators.
National Westminster said that to become a major player, more investment
was needed than it was willing to put in. So it has quit the business
altogether.
It also got out of the associated registrar business, which maintains
shareholder registers for companies and arranges the dispatch of
dividends. It sold its operation to the Royal Bank, making the latter
the second-largest registrar.
Lloyds said its purchase was in line with its policy to concentrate on
activities where it can establish a commanding market position. It has
made a hefty investment in new computer systems to improve service to
customers. The deal about doubles the assets it has in custody to
#110bn.
Henderson, the fund management group, recently decided to out-source
its custody requirements to the Royal Bank, and even Prudential is
deciding which company to choose.
Typically, it is the larger more active institutions which out-source.
The smaller inactive funds are more likely to continue to do it
in-house. In fact, about half the #1000bn pension fund industry is still
doing in-house custody which suggests there is room for the market to
grow yet.

VENTURE capital firm 3i and Government-owned Scottish Development
Finance have backed a #3m management buy-out at DL Wholesale stationers,
the Glasgow-based wholesaler of stationery, greetings cards and soft
toys.
Roy McKelvie, senior investment controller at 3i, said a five-member
management team led by Paul Savage had arranged to buy the firm from its
founders, John and Elizabeth Delday, who were retiring.
3i and Scottish Development Finance, a subsidiary of Scottish
Enterprise, will each hold 15% stakes in DL Wholesale Stationers after
the buy-out. The management team will hold the remaining 70% of equity.
DL Wholesale Stationers has cash-and-carry outlets in Glasgow and
Aberdeen and had a turnover of nearly #8m in the financial year to May
31, 1994.

THE competitive pressure on the Stock Exchange has further increased
with the disclosure that the Securities and Investments Board is to
apply to the Treasury for leave to recognise Tradepoint Financial
Network as an investment exchange, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Tradepoint is a screen-based electronic forum for the secondary market
trading of listed securities. It will be used by the professional
investment manager and will be order-driven, enabling investors to deal
directly with each other.
Orders are automatically matched with participants, setting out the
number of shares and prices, and so by-passing the need for any broker
or market-maker.
The company is raising #5.74m net by way of a private placing by
Williams de Broe.
The system was originally designed for the Vancouver Stock Exchange
and is seen as a useful addition to the financial services provided in
the UK.
However, there has been some criticism that, with the share market
becoming more fragmented, it will become more difficult to obtain the
best price at any one time without a central share price monitoring
system.

PROVIDING quality courses and serving the customer and the community
are the key aims of Kilmarnock College, according to marketing manager
Gerry Freel.
Based in Holehouse Road, the college has operated on its present site
since 1966. This session 3500 students enrolled for courses, while
evening course enrolments have risen by 30%.
The college has seven divisions: Mechanical Engineering, Electronics
and Electrical Engineering, Business Studies, Caring Studies, General
Education, Science and Science Services. Much of the work students do in
all these divisions is project and assignment based.
The college is currently working towards the Scottish Quality
Management System (SQMS). This is an overall system taking in standards
from 14 different bodies including Investors in People, the Scottish
Education Department, and SCOTVEC. ''We have already submitted an
interim report,'' said quality manager John Brown, ''and we hope to gain
SQMS in the near future.''
The college is also working towards achieving Investors in People
status by June. ''We are totally committed to quality in every sector of
our operation,'' added John Brown. ''Our customers, whether students,
employers or the local community, are the most important people and our
current quality drive is an attempt to improve the service we offer on a
continuous basis.''
The college itself provides short courses on Quality Management such
as SQMS Internal Auditor Training for local employers. Scotvec modules
on Quality Practice in the Workplace are also available for employees.
John Brown emphasised, ''It is vitally important to promote the notion
of quality at every level of an organisation, to show that it is the
responsibility of all employees and not just managers.''
The college also piloted BS5750 courses designed to help companies
working towards this, delivering them to over 40 Volvo employees in
Irvine and to shop floor workers and team leaders at Prestwick Circuits.
Quality Improvement Technique courses have also been taught, while the
college helped the CTS Corporation in Blantyre gain Ford QI
accreditation. Also on offer is a two-year, part-time HNC in Quality
Assurance.
Marketing manager Gerry Freel stresses, ''Quality is a key word for
the college and to show our commitment to quality in equipment and
premises we have recently spent #150,000 and gained Scottish Education
Department support for a new chemistry and computing laboratory in the
Science Division.

WHILE consumer confidence remains fragile there are some retailers
still managing to show good profits growth. Furniture manufacturer and
retailer DFS is one.
Its marketing-led approach both in and out of town have enabled it to
boost interim pre-tax profits by 31% to #13.1m. Sales grew by 10.6% to
#73.7m.
Founder and chairman Graham Kirkham said that trading in the first
half had been difficult but that the improved results had been in line
with budget estimates.
DFS continues to grow the business and plans to open 20 new stores
over the next three years. ''DFS has never been in better shape,'' said
Mr Kirkham. The company, which floated in 1993, is offering shareholders
a 15.2% increase in the dividend from 2.3p to 2.65p.
The group's balance sheet remains very healthy despite the capital
expenditure programme. It is consistently and substantially cash
generative. At the end of the first half, cash balances stood at #28.5m,
up from #16.5m at the comparable time last year.
The results were in line with City forecasts but even so buyers were
out for what is seen as a quality company and the shares jumped 22p to
273p.
The share price was helped by news that it is seeking powers to buy
back its own shares although it has no current plans to do so.

THE scramble to avoid relegation has been the most riveting aspect of
the season in the premier division, but the race to finish second also
has been fascinating. With only a few weeks to go, it is still possible
that any one of six clubs could be runners-up.
The second-top spot is not merely prestigious as it carries with it
automatic entry into the UEFA Cup. Only one of the contenders, Celtic,
are in with a chance of taking part in Europe otherwise.
The Parkhead side have more games left to play than the others but,
with the Tennents Scottish Cup final against Airdrie on their minds,
that may not be such an advantage.
Motherwell, whose win over Aberdeen last week revived spirits, must be
favourites, as they sit a point ahead of the pack, and are the only ones
who can claim the place entirely by their own efforts.
If they win their last three games, against Rangers, Kilmarnock, and
Hearts, no-one can catch them. One slip, however, even a draw, and the
great chase could be wide open. Motherwell's highest possible points
total is 57. Both Falkirk and Celtic can reach 56, and Hibs can get to
the 55 mark.
It would need a collapse of startling proportions by the Brockville
side as well as the Parkhead team, not to mention Motherwell, to let in
Killie, who can collect 51 points in all, or even less likely, Hearts,
who can reach only 49.
Unless you are anticipating that kind of 100-1 scenario, therefore, it
looks very much as if Motherwell have three potent challenges to shake
off.
It may be that the Fir Park players' experience in the UEFA Cup last
season has been the motivating force which has kept them setting the
pace behind Rangers. After a preliminary-round win over Havnar Boltflag,
Motherwell met one of the best, if not the best, teams in Germany,
Borussia Dortmund. Many expected them to be thrashed by the
multi-million-pound club, but they lost only by a goal in Dortmund and
then, after Dougie Arnott was sent off, going down 2-0 in the second
leg.
The memory of that tie lingers with the Motherwell players, most of
whom had not enjoyed that kind of European spotlight. They came out of
it convinced they could compete with the best and Dortmund, who went on
to the semi-finals of the competition before losing to Juventus, have
proved that much correct.
Falkirk, whose manager Jim Jefferies will win any prize for the most
timely signings of the season, have two of their three remaining games
at home but they look formidable challenges, against Celtic and
Aberdeen. However, Jefferies' side, which has been catapulted up the
table since he signed Mo Johnston, Steve Kirk, and Paul McGrillen, are
inclined to do best when taking on the bigger clubs.
Jefferies, who would be a reasonable candidate for anybody's manager
of the year, is allowing himself to believe that the European dream
might be feasible. ''When you think a few weeks ago we were looking like
relegation bets it has been an amazing run for us, one defeat in 10
games.''
Jefferies looks at the fixtures left and reckons that he is entitled
to consider a UEFA Cup spot a serious target. ''Motherwell have a
particularly tough finish, starting with Rangers on Saturday, and if
they even draw we could beat Celtic and find ourselves in the position
where we could get there by our own efforts.''
Jefferies' team would then have the dangerous Partick Thistle to meet
at Firhill before they ended their season against Aberdeen at
Brockville.
Celtic managed to slip into second favourite spot after losing to
Hearts at Hampden but, if they were to win their four matches, they
might just redeem that error.
The temptation to believe that they will be taking part in the
Cup-winners' Cup after May 27 will be great, but Airdrie will be
determined to spoil that presumption, and the memory of their Coca-Cola
Cup final defeat by Raith Rovers ought to help concentrate minds.
Their game with Falkirk this Saturday looks sure to end one of the two
team's hopes of a UEFA chance.
Hibs, like Celtic, have been too fond of draws this season and as a
consequence find themselves needing three teams to slip before they can
snatch the UEFA Cup place.

THE performance was hardly encouraging, but if there was a glimmer of
hope after the Scottish Under-21 side had struggled to beat their
counterparts from San Marino the other night it was provided by the
behaviour of Scotland's captain Steven Pressley.
The Coventry City player strode through the match like someone who has
been given a new lease of life.
Pressley collected his sixteenth cap at Under-21 level with the
assurance of a born leader, and so long as he is patrolling the hearts
of Scotland's defence there must always be hope.
Pressley had more to say than anyone else. ''So far as all the
shouting and directing goes I do it because it seems natural,'' he said.
There was a time after his move to Coventry last year when it seemed
he was being subdued. The then manager, Phil Neale, openly criticised
Pressley's style, but his career appears back on track with Ron Atkinson
and Gordon Strachan as the new management team.

JIMMY FORREST,
President of the
Scottish Timber
Trade Association
LET me tell you a story. Once upon a time there was a Scottish timber
importer. His job involved bringing wood from Scandinavia, Russia, North
America, South America, and parts of Africa and Asia into Scotland.
This wood was used for lots of things, such as building houses and
furniture. The timber importer helped to create jobs for lots of people
-- some 5000 in Scotland -- and an industry worth some #300m.
But he was very sad.
This timber importer had a wife and children. One day his little boy
came home from school and said:
''I hate you, Daddy. You are a bad man. We were learning about trees
and forests today and I know you are a bad man because you cut down
trees.''
Fairy story? Sadly, no; it's a true story, told to me only recently.
In truth it is more of a horror story -- especially if you are involved
in the timber trade and care deeply, as I do, about the broad sweep of
misinformation that exists about so many aspects of the legitimate
timber industry.
So why does our trade incur such wrath? After all, we deal in a truly
friendly product from the earth, sun, and rain which, when well managed
-- as most timber now is -- leaves no toxic waste, no unsightly
spoilheaps, and no areas of dead sea or land. Indeed, once harvested the
land is replanted to continue the growing cycle which absorbs carbon
dioxide and releases life-giving oxygen to our beleaguered planet.
Despite this, those of us whose livelihood is the low-energy
conversion of imported hardwoods and softwoods into valuable products
are more often than not branded as irresponsible exploiters and even
murderers of the environment.
Even though 90% of all timber cut down in the world is burned by
people living in the forest itself or on adjacent land. Even though 100%
of logs, sawn timber, and wood fibre products move out of the country of
origin under control of the Government of that country -- or should do.
Even though we in the timber trade applaud and support concern and
action on behalf of those affected by irresponsible destruction and
exploitation of forest areas.
So why the imbalance in information? The answer is quite simple. It's
money.
Big-budget, media-wise lobby organisations, with their high-profile
media personality friends, have found the law-abiding, low-profile
timber trade to be a soft target. With 10 times the budget of the timber
trade, these campaigners have successfully lobbied against the
commercial felling of trees, not just in Brazil but throughout the
world. They have skilfully communicated their simplistic messages such
as ''stop felling trees'' -- especially, it would seem, to children.
For reasons of fair and full information, if none other, this
one-sided argument has to stop. So here I am on my soapbox (made, of
course, from Scandinavian softwood, derived from forests where four
trees are planted to replace every one felled).
To the world at large I say: Beware of simplistic and emotive
arguments. When you are asked to discriminate against timber, compare it
with the alternative products -- plastics, steel, aluminium. Ask
yourself -- which used less energy to produce? Which degrades more
naturally and safely? Which is more renewable? Which will perform
better? And which is more beautiful?
To the lobby organisations I say: Yes. Continue to target the
exploiters; stop the lawbreakers. But don't tar everyone with the same
brush. We in the trade will support you in your legitimate efforts.
After all, we depend on forests too and wish to preserve them for the
future. But beware the ''nanny knows best'' attitude that prevents
native governments from using their own country's natural resources. And
remember -- nothing will contribute more quickly to the destruction of
the forests than the loss of their commercial value through a total
logging ban.
Finally, to my own colleagues I say: Stop being defensive about your
product. Don't close ranks when under attack. Be pro-active; get out
there and explain your product to the environmentalists, the customers,
your friends and, most importantly, the children.
If we all do this then perhaps the full story will be told. And I can
get down off my soapbox.

PROVIDING a boon to the city-centre working family is the nursery at
Adelaide Place Baptist Church. Because of its convenient location for
local offices, parent and child could travel together in the morning and
evening. And if parents are on the doorstep they can have lunch with
their child.
The nursery caters for children aged from three to five years and is
open from 8.30am until 5.30pm, Monday to Friday, 50 weeks of the year
(closed Christmas and New Year, and Public Holidays). Morning or
afternoon sessions are also available and cover the hours of 8.30-12.30
or 1.30-5.30.
The aim of the nursery is to provide a high quality of child care and
education with a broad and balanced curriculum to foster the all round
development of each child. The staff are aware of the importance of a
child's early years and will seek to provide an education that will lay
a foundation for the rest of their lives.
Head of the nursery Miss Sheila Riach, said: ''Every child will be
treated as an individual, special and unique and we will provide an
environment with an atmosphere of love and care.''
The nursery accommodation has been designed to the highest standards
and has separate areas for learning and play. The bright, spacious
surroundings are ideal for learning and the staff's aim is to encourage
children to reach their full potential. An outside play area will be
added to the nursery's facilities in July in which there will be space
for physical activities.
If it is not your wish to provide your child with a packed lunch a
well-balanced meal may be provided at the school.
The dedicated and committed staff are fully qualifed with NNEB or
teaching qualifications and this combined offers a first-class service.
Fees at the nursery are #75 per week, full-time; #40 per week,
part-time; #18 per day; lunch is provided at a cost of #5 per week.
For more information or to arrange a personal visit to view the
nursery, contact Sheila Riach at Adelaide on 0141 248 4970.
A bright welcome awaits children and their parents at the spacious
nursery, which aims to combine fun with learning

EXCLUSIVE:
THE Scottish Football League are set to probe the latest allegations
that Celtic breached their rules over ''enticement'' while they were
attempting to appoint a new manager last summer.
Already Celtic have been fined #100,000 by the League over their
illegal approach to their present manager Tommy Burns while he was under
contract as both player and manager at Kilmarnock.
Now, as I revealed last week, Celtic could be in further trouble.
I understand that in their submission to the SFA-appointed tribunal --
a body which has been set up to fix a compensation figure for Celtic to
pay Kilmarnock over the loss of Burns and his assistant Billy Stark --
Celtic have admitted interviewing Ivan Golac among other managers.
Now Dundee United have asked the League to investigate the affair. A
League spokesman confirmed yesterday that there has been a request from
Tannadice for an inquiry and it is possible that the management
committee will demand an explanation from Celtic chief Fergus McCann.
If the Parkhead club have incriminated themselves, it could lead to
further disciplinary action.
Apparently Celtic felt that because Golac had now been sacked by the
Tannadice club, they would be in the clear. But, of course, at the time
of the alleged interview, Golac was still under contract to United and
had just taken the Scottish Cup back to Tayside.
If this is correct, it would be another major gaffe by Celtic, whose
problems already have cost them at least #100,000.
Dundee United, while they did not lose their manager in the manner in
which Kilmarnock did, must still feel a sense of grievance that Golac
would surely have been unsettled if, in football terms, an illegal bid
had been made for his services. Interviewing a manager of another club
breaches the League rules.
When Celtic appealed against their record fine earlier this season,
they found support from just one club. This time it's doubtful if they
would attract even that solitary voice of support while they continue to
pursue policies which apparently run contrary to the rules by which
every member club must abide.
I doubt if the club would face another huge fine but, equally, the
management committee were angered by Celtic's attitude first time round
and this latest admission will do nothing to help their cause.

Because most other peoples speak degrees
of English, it's too convenient for Britons
to opt out of Languages. But disinclination
is not the same as inability, says
R D Kernohan, and retreating
from the challenge is pound-foolish.
THERE are two related fallacies to reassure Britons with the
widespread national hesitation about learning and speaking other
people's languages.
The first is that in the better-ordered foreign countries ''they all
speak English anyway''. The second is that English will soon be every
foreigner's second language.
But as one variant of English says: ''It ain't necessarily so.''
English is by far the world's most widely spoken international language.
Countries which hoped to reduce its dominance, such as India and South
Africa, had second thoughts thrust on them. But English is a long way
short of being a universal language.
From the business point of view, we may have the worst of both worlds.
We're caught out if we assume everyone speaks English. But so many
people speak English that it's essential for our competitors' marketing,
promotion, and sales forces to make it one of their working languages.
Like many fallacies, the two about the dominance of English have
developed from a basis of fact. There are countries where (by our
language standards in Britain) there is an astonishing proficiency in
English. Norway leads the field followed by the other Scandinavian
countries and the Netherlands. Village children in rural Norway
understand your questions and give you directions in English. Yet I once
got courteous Danish regrets when I asked about using English to get
tickets from Copenhagen across to Sweden.
It is true that English is far better spoken throughout Europe (except
possibly in France) than foreign languages are here, but it's easy to
exaggerate the polyglottal capacity of Continentals -- or to misjudge
what range of languages they find useful. I've painful memories of
waiting in a queue in Communist days at Debrecen station (near the
Eastern Hungarian border) to find out about seat reservations back to
Budapest. When I got to the counter I drew a blank in English and, more
surprisingly, German.
My phrase-book Magyar was only enough to confirm that they didn't
speak either. But the station was 20 miles from Romania and 50 from the
then Soviet Union. It could probably have coped with the languages over
these borders.
It's also true that English has a vital role as a second language, not
only in India and African countries of the old British Empire but in
China, potentially the great market of the future.
However, it's a mistake to underestimate the tenacity and importance
of other major second languages. Herald readers of Murray Ritchie's
adventures in Brussels need no reminding of the tenacity. In a different
way it flourishes in enormous areas of Africa, a unifying factor within
countries and vital channel of communication among them. And even the
rise of Islamic fundamentalism cannot displace it as the medium through
which the Maghreb will communicate with the non-Arabic world.
But French is not even the second most widely-spoken European
language, nor the most important Latin language of the future.
Statistically it falls behind both Spanish and Portuguese, both of which
have not only far more native speakers than French but significant roles
as ''second'' languages. This is most obvious in the survival of
Portuguese amid the turbulence of Mozambique and Angola, but it also
applies in ''Latin'' America where one of the cultural revolutions of
the next century may be the revival of native languages.
German is also becoming more important than French as a Continental
European second language. The British Council, which argues that
English-language teaching abroad amounts to a major export industry,
claims that 50,000,000 people in Russia and Eastern Europe are learning
English today. The number of people learning German beyond the rusted
Iron Curtain is put at less than half that. But this amounts to a major
revival of German, which two generations of Czechs and Poles tried to
forget or did not have to learn.
The statistical comparison is also misleading, for much of the
commerce and tourism of Central and Eastern Europe provides more
opportunities to use German and English, and a working knowledge of
German may become as common as it was up to the afermath of the Second
World War. My guess is that the Debrecen information desk will have
brushed up its German before it uses English.
This situation has implications for the language-teaching business in
Britain, which readily responds to market forces, and for the cultural
patterns and preferences reflected in school language teaching and
non-vocational sectors of higher education. Among factors to be taken
into account are:
* French retains dominance in education (as well as in parts of the
European Union bureaucracy) out of proportion to its modern world role
and even its place among Latin languages. Yet it is probably a more
difficult language for Britons to learn than Spanish or even Portuguese,
both spoken by far more people.
* German is no longer a declining but a reviving language, thanks to
the changes in Eastern Europe.
* Russian will always be an important international language
everywhere between Prague and Vladivostok. Its future should not be
judged either by present political confusion or the understandable
reaction in Easter Europe against the ideologically imposed Russian of
the Communist era.
* And in the long run British education must take more account than it
does of the languages of the Far East, given the economic importance of
Japan and potential of China.
Perhaps the British have to shake off the notion that, because they
struggled with school-room French, they have a natural inaptitude or
even ineptitude for languages.
Where motiviation is strong (as it ought to be in business) we do well
enough. Missionaries, soldiers and imperial administrators mastered
languages far more remote from our culture than major languages familiar
to diplomats and specialist salespeople.
We sometimes mistake disinclination to speak other languages for a
natural incapacity, and we pay a price in commercial opportunities.

* DISAPPOINTED Rangers fans won't see the League Championship trophy
presented this Saturday -- at the club's own request.
The Ibrox side were confirmed as seven-in-a-row champions two weeks
ago after nearest challengers Celtic lost to Aberdeen, and fans had
thought the trophy could be paraded after the weekend clash with
Motherwell.
But Walter Smith's men will have to wait until May 13, when they face
Partick Thistle at Ibrox, before being presented with the silverware.
Scottish League spokesman David Thomson said: ''Rangers requested that
the trophy be withheld until the last day of the season.
''The presentation will be after their final League game against
Partick Thistle on May 13.''

How a Glasgow-based valve manufacturer solved the small suppliers'
quality problem of the nineties
THE April winner of the TrailBlazer of the Month award is a
manufacturing giant that has proved small can be beautiful with a 100%
success rate in an innovatory quality training programme.
A year ago, Glasgow-based Keystone Valve -- like many other
manufacturing companies -- was wrestling with the quality problem of the
nineties: how could it ensure its local suppliers achieved the quality
accreditation required by the international marketplace.
Part of an international group, Keystone Valve UK currently generates
around #20m a year from the Glasgow base, exporting its pneumatic and
electric actuators, which regulate valves, globally. In quality terms it
had blazed its own trail in 1984 by becoming the first UK actuator
producer to achieve BS 5750 Part 1.
Keystone's plant manager, Jack McGowan, said: ''We have a
long-standing commitment to quality, but the international marketplace
now demands that all suppliers have quality accreditation.
''Many of our suppliers, however, are local; small companies that
could not afford to put themselves through accreditation and were
perhaps more than a little in awe of the process.''
Having traditionally worked hand in hand with its suppliers,
Keystone's answer was simple but effective -- it would play host to a
quality club for the small companies that are the backbone of its
production run.
The pilot programme got backing from Strathclyde Business Development
(SBD), the economic arm of the region, and Glasgow Development Agency.
Six training companies were asked to prepare a potential programme and
Jaybee Management Services was selected by Keystone as the training
facilitator.
Twelve months on, the core 10 companies chosen -- ranging in size from
30 employees to only four -- have all achieved the updated ISO 9000.
They recently celebrated the first anniversary of the establishment of
their own Top Ten Club at a dinner where Keystone divisional president
Denis Cawte praised the initiative ''as setting a lead for many
companies which now need to establish an accreditated chain of supply''.
Robert Paton, assistant director of SBD -- which was the key funder of
the programme through its management and technology training grant
scheme -- said: ''We believe they have developed a model that highlights
the benefits of partnership between the public and the private sectors
and between large and small companies, which could become a prototype
for quality improvement and accreditation across the country.
''Although it was a partnership it did, however, require a great deal
of commitment from Keystone as the host company and the key player in
the programme.''
Included in the Top Ten Club were machine shops, anodisers, aluminium
die-casters, and spring manufacturers spread across Glasgow, Paisley,
and Ayrshire, with one company even based in Fife.
Gregor Stewart, a business counsellor with Glasgow Development Agency,
said: ''The knock-on benefits for Keystone reach further than just a
chain of quality accreditation.
''By bringing together its suppliers in this way, Keystone has helped
create greater team spirit among the companies and it has helped them to
achieve their potential. These companies can now look out on the wider
marketplace with greater confidence and perhaps even contemplate
exporting, which will benefit the local economy and provide Keystone
with a core base of solid suppliers well into the foreseeable future.''
Among the individual success stories of the Top Ten Club is Coatech
Metal Finishing of Whiteinch. Managing director John McCourtney admits
that he had more than a smidgeon of trepidation about going for quality
accreditation.
He said: ''Now I could not be more delighted. With only 11 employees
at the time, we did not really have anything that amounted to a quality
management system in place at all, but now everything is going like
clockwork.''
Another four employees have been taken on and the company's customer
base has substantially increased with Coatech currently making forays
into the building trade and considering exporting.
Having worked with more than 350 companies in Scotland, training
facilitator Jaybee is a veteran in helping firms achieve quality
accreditation, but even so, the Keystone scheme remains a landmark.
Watson Brown, principal consultant with Jaybee, said: ''To get a 100%
success rate is tremendous and a tribute to the commitment of all
parties concerned. However, Keystone was the cornerstone of the whole
concept and its execution, and its evident enthusiasm and commitment
helped generate an atmosphere of success.''
John Ker, head of owner-managed business services at Ernst &amp; Young's
Glasgow office, was also full of praise.
''This initiative by Keystone has been of significant benefit to the
local economy as, rather than looking elsewhere for already accredited
suppliers, they have encouraged their local companies both to meet their
own needs and become more competitive,'' he explained.
Keystone's production manager, Ian Ogily, said: ''Our thanks go to the
suppliers, SBD, GDA, and Jaybee. We believe together we have created a
way forward for quality management and we would now like to see other
companies running with this ball.''

BOROUGHMUIR will fly the Scottish flag in Europe next season as part
of Euro Rugby 95, an eight-team ''cup winners' cup'' in Leiden, Holland.
Details of the trailblazing event were announced at the Royal
Netherlands Embassy in London yesterday.
The other clubs in the knockout tournament, which will take place from
August 19-27, are the hosts, Dutch Cup winners LRC Diok, Wasps, Swansea,
Toulouse from France, Blackrock College, Treviso from Italy and --
probably -- the Spanish club Bilbao.
There will be no prize-money, but each of the 25-strong squads will
take part on an all-expenses paid basis. Boroughmuir were invited to
participate as the last winners of the unofficial Allied Breweries Cup
competition.
Clubs have to receive the sanction of their home unions and
Boroughmuir have been assured that the Dutch RFC has kept the Scottish
Rugby Union appraised.
Boroughmuir secretary Norman Bryson said: ''I would not be so bold as
to say that it points the way forward for European rugby, but it will
get the European clubs together in a way that has never happened before
and can only be good.''
Meanwhile, Scottish champions Stirling County, who have been invited
to participate in a separate European Super League, are awaiting further
information from the organisers Carnegie-Quintas.
The Bridgehaugh club received an invitation from the organisers, but
have reserved their position until more details on dates, finance and
official sanction from the SRU are forthcoming.
The possibility of a European Super League was first mooted by
Carnegie marketing man Lindsay Singleton last year. Carnegie, the
Edinburgh-based sports management organisation which is part of Rangers'
chairman David Murray's business empire and which employs Scotland
captain Gavin Hastings, is working on the project as a joint venture
with Quintas.
Quintas director Peter Worth told The Herald last night that the Euro
Super League was being promoted by founder clubs Leicester, Bath,
Cardiff, Swansea, Toulouse and Brive. Stirling County, Wasps,
Pontypridd, Toulon, Shannon and Milan were being invited to participate.
Worth added that the ambitious scheme could not proceed until the
various Unions involved had given the project their blessing. ''The six
founding clubs have applied to their Unions for permission to proceed
and nothing further can be done until that is given.'' There was no-one
available for comment at Murrayfield yesterday.
Worth said that the project would need an operating budget of over
#1m, but finance would not be a problem. ''We have already held talks
with potential backers. He said: Rugby union is on a high just now and
things are looking good.''
Last night Stirling County president Bill Gibson said: ''Our secretary
has received a fax, apparently from Quintas, but the details are very
sketchy. We don't know how the competition will be financed or when the
games would be played.
''It sounds great on paper but how it would fit into an already
crowded fixture list I just don't know. Until we get more concrete
information, and permission from the SRU, it sounds a bit like pie in
the sky.''
* SCOTTISH Brewers' managing director Collin Wood has confirmed that
negotiations are ongoing with the Scottish Rugby Union over the brewers'
continued support for Scottish rugby next season.

JJB Sports, the sporting goods chain headed by former Blackburn Rovers
player David Whelan, scored a 66% leap in profits last year -- making
#1m more than it forecast on its stock market flotation in November.
Shareholders are to receive a final dividend of 2p, [1/2]p higher than
expected at flotation, making a total payout for the year of 3.22p
against 2.08p.
Taxable profits during the 12 months to the end of January soared to
#7.6m, #3m higher than in the previous year. Turnover climbed by 47%
from #41.2m to #60.5m and earnings per share amounted to 18.75p against
12.42p.
By the end of the year the group was operating from 126 stores,
including four in Spain, 25 more than at the end of the previous year.
Chairman Mr Whelan said it had been an exciting year for the company,
which is based in Wigan.

SCOTTISH Friendly Assurance announced a 22% increase in sales of life
assurance policies in 1994, with premium income rising 8% to a total of
#8m, writes ROBERT POWELL.
The Glasgow-based firm which has 13 branches throughout the UK, said
last year's good sales figures should boost income from insurance
premiums even more rapidly in 1995.
Chief executive Robert Thomson said the Government's decision to raise
the ceiling on individual tax-free investments in friendly societies
from #18 to #25 per month, which takes effect in May, should also boost
1995 sales.
Mr Thomson said Scottish Friendly bucked the market trend last year by
increasing its volume of ordinary assurance annual premium policies paid
by direct debit by 66%. The market average fell by 10%.
New business rose to #2.2m last year after falling to #1.8m in 1993
from #2.0m in 1992.
Scottish Friendly, which is one of two friendly societies based in
Scotland, had #114m in assurance funds at the end of 1994, up from #102m
at the close of 1993.
The company said it ranked sixth among the top 10 performers for
20-year term life assurance policies last year and fourth for 10-year
policies.

San Marino
San Marino 0, Scotland 2
ERNIE Walker and his think-tank should be instructed to work around
the clock when they get down to the serious business of analysing
Scottish football's ills. The game needs help even if we are being asked
constantly to believe results, like the one achieved in San Marino last
night, are all that matter.
The sound of the small band of Scottish fans who made the journey to
the Italian republic chanting ''what a load of rubbish'' before the end
of the game suggests that the customers prefer to be entertained as well
as given points.
Scotland still have a great deal of work to do if qualification to the
European Championship finals in England next summer is to be assured and
the evidence so far tends to show that there is a problem when it comes
to scoring goals.
For instance, John Collins, who scored a truly wonderful goal last
night, was the top scorer in the squad which was employed for last
night's game and it was he who had to do something special again to
break the deadlock.
When the Celtic midfield player took possession midway inside his own
half after 19 minutes and ran away from a couple of defenders, he looked
up and saw a familiar sight, strikers either running away or into
offside positions.
Fortunately, Collins had the wit and control to speed on and around a
few more San Marino players and then their keeper, Pier Luigi
Benedettini, and stroke the ball into the empty net.
Benedettini had tried to trip the player and was cautioned while, all
around him, Scotland's players celebrated.
That goal ought to have been the forerunner to more, but Scotland
failed to colour their game or vary it enough and San Marino's
defenders, although always on the back foot, coped with many of the high
deliveries and were heading towards what would have been something of a
moral victory for them before Colin Calderwood scored with a header five
minutes from time.
The Tottenham Hotspur central defender had gone up in support of an
attack and was placed perfectly in the centre of the box when Gary
McAllister's cross arrived. It was Calderwood's first goal for his
country in only his second international match.
The manager, Craig Brown, said he could not criticise any of his
players for their commitment and also said he was pleased that they had
remained disciplined, but we should not lose sight of the fact that the
opposition had played only 22 competitive matches prior to last night or
that their best result in that sequence was a no-score draw at home to
Turkey two years ago.
San Marino also had been losing goals at an average rate of four per
match which suggested strongly that their keeper should stick to his day
job, which is as a bus driver with the family firm. However, he did make
a couple of tremendous saves especially one from McAllister, but he
really ought to have collected the ball from the back of his net more
than twice.
There was nothing he could do about Collins' goal which was his eighth
in 24 international matches and also his fourth in the current campaign.
If the Scots do reach the finals much of the credit will have to go to
the midfield player and Brown acknowledged his contribution by saying:
''John has done a great shift for us in this championship. He has been
an outstanding influence.''
The manager added that he is not overly concerned that a midfield
player and a central defender scored the goals and stressed: ''I am
convinced we'll score in the remaining fixtures.''
It is difficult to share his optimism and unless players like Eoin
Jess, Duncan Ferguson, and Ally McCoist all return fit, eager, and with
their finishing touches intact, goals could remain in short supply and
that will most certainly be a problem when Scotland play against Greece
and Finland in August and September.
Results elsewhere last night strengthen the prospect of Group 8 being
decided on goal difference and it is just as well goals scored against
the weaker sides, San Marino and the Faroe Islands, will not count in
the final analysis should the top sides be locked together on points.
The Russians stormed back into contention with a handsome 3-0 victory
over Greece in Salonika, while Finland easily won 4-0 in the Faroes,
and, although Scotland remain in third place behind the Finns and the
Greeks, much will change when the group action resumes early next
season.
''I would say these results prove how good our performances were
against Russia and Finland,'' said Brown, ''and I have to hope now that
Russia beat the Greeks when they play in Moscow next season.
''It will still be difficult for us but I believe our remaining four
matches against the Faroe Islands, Greece, Finland, and San Marino can
all be won and then, I am sure, we would still have enough points to
qualify.''
Before leaving the Serravalle Stadium, Collins said: ''That was the
best goal I have ever scored for Scotland although it was unlike me to
run such a long way. It was always going to be a difficult match for us
because they had one purpose and that was to defend.
''Also, the pitch was very narrow and that made it easier for them,
but we got the points and that's all that matters.''
Perhaps, but real teams tend to win with a touch of flair and a little
panache. Scotland, unfortunately, remain very much a workmanlike outfit,
yet they might just make it to England.

NIGEL DEWAR GIBB has championed the cause of individual shareholders
for almost 20 years. He was often in the spotlight during the power
struggles at the House of Fraser when he was secretary of the store
group's profit-linked share plan.
At the height of the battle for control of House of Fraser, when
Lonrho was locked in a titanic struggle with the board, and later when
the Fayeds took over the company, the share plan scheme represented
20,000 employee shareholders and 5000 former employees.
Nigel Dewar Gibb left the stockbroking firm of Parsons at the end of
1974 to become one of Sir Hugh's personal assistants, and in 1977 he
launched the store group's profit-linked share plan.
''We were only the sixth company in Britain to have such a scheme, and
we were by far the largest,'' says Nigel Dewar Gibb.
At its peak, the employees and former employees held between 3% and 4%
of House of Fraser shares. When the Fayed brothers finally took complete
control of the company in May 1985, Nigel Dewar Gibb received a cheque
for #16m on behalf of the employee shareholders, which he points out is
not what normally happens at the end of a takeover.
''Employees are often lucky if they are told their jobs are safe, but
in our case the employees shared in the financial gain from being
shareholders.''
At the time of the takeover the Fayeds said that, despite the company
going into private ownership, they would try to find an alternative
share plan.
Two years later, they introduced an employee share option plan which
Nigel Dewar Gibb at present manages.
The former member of the Scottish Stock Exchange fervently believes
that the ownership of a company should be spread throughout the
employees, which is why he is active in the United Kingdom Shareholders
Association and is chairman of the newly-formed Scottish branch of the
association.
He is also proud of his involvement with David Erdal in helping to
shape the Tullis Russell scheme, which is progressively transferring the
ownership of the company from the family to the workforce.
He intends to take early retirement this summer, and will devote his
time to furthering the cause of the independent shareholder.

THE much-hyped sponsorship of British athletics by a burger chain is
costing Scottish athletics clubs money, and wrecking their summer
programmes.
Several clubs are considering their futures in the McDonald's Girls'
League, which involves 121 clubs throughout Britain, backed as part of a
#2m package over two years.
Competition in the premier division cost Edinburgh Woollen Mill and
City of Glasgow more than #6500 last season, and four English clubs,
asked to travel for a north-east division fixture in Edinburgh, have
refused, leaving the hosts no option but to cancel the match.
Worse, two of the English defectors have been accommodated in other
divisions south of the Border, while the blameless Scottish clubs,
Edinburgh Athletic Club and JGB Central, have been offered no
alternative competition, although yesterday it was confirmed they are to
be offered a place in another division later this year.
''We are sponsoring McDonald's, rather than them sponsoring
athletics,'' claimed Edinburgh Woollen Mill's senior coach, George
Sinclair.
''We abandoned the UK league in the belief that the new one would be
better. We would love not to have gone into it, but for the sake of the
athletes, and our obligation to give them competition, we have to find
the money. The UK League no longer caters for the girls' age groups.
''But the old structure was vastly more economical. We are more than
#5000 out of pocket compared with then. Our expenses in sending a team
to McDonald's Girls' League matches last year topped #7405. We received
a travel grant from them totalling #798, leaving us #6607 out of pocket.
Accommodation is the biggest cost, and we want a bigger slice of the
cake.
City of Glasgow treasurer Susan Fox confirmed yesterday that her club
has similar reservations, having incurred a deficit last season of
#6512. ''There was no indication as to what travel allowances would be
when we joined, and we have tried without success to get hold of the
league's accounts,'' she said.
McDonald's specify the amount available from their #2m to the youth
Leagues. The girls' league gets #25,000 per year to cover track hire,
bursaries at the final, printing, postage, and other administration,
from the British federation. ''Once that is paid, there is #9600 left to
allocate towards girls' travel costs,'' said administrator Olive Megit.
There are 47 league matches in Britain this year. Only one of these in
Scotland.

LEEDS Permanent Building Society yesterday reported record half-year
profits, less than a month before members vote on the planned merger
with the Halifax.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to March 31 rose to #140.2m from
#122.1m in last year's corresponding period helped by provisions for
mortgage defaulters halving to #30.9m from #62.4m.
During the period the society spent #5.8m in connection with the
proposed merger. Members vote on the link-up at a special meeting on May
22.
Chairman Malcolm Barr said the continued gradual economic recovery had
had little impact on the subdued housing market.

A TRAVELLING seminar on Britain and the Single European Currency came
to Scotland yesterday. The participants left politics behind and quickly
got down to business.
Recent political rhetoric surrounding the implications for the UK of
European economic and monetary union was all but absent when the
Edinburgh Merchants Hall seminar was staged.
Grant Baird, executive director of Scottish Financial Enterprise, in
an overview of the event, said: ''After all the somewhat heated debate
by politicians the enquiry represented, in contrast, a cool assessment
from a business viewpoint.''
His SFE chairman-designate Jack Shaw of the Bank of Scotland was one
of a panel of experts, along with fellow professor Gavin McCrone of
Edinburgh University.
They discussed the impact on Scotland from a single currency and what
it would mean to employment and wages, inward investment, fiscal
transfers, and migration.
Action Centre for Europe was behind the seminar and project director
Michael Welsh said around 60 participants from the Scottish financial,
business, and academic communities attended.
''The working group was established in January to provide an objective
analysis of the implications for Britain of a possible EMU, so that
people can make up their own minds where they stand.''
The seminar was concerned with the impact of EMU on what the Action
Centre described as geographically outlying economies such as Scotland.
Three sessions covered technical aspects of establishing a single
currency, its social and economic effect on Scotland, and implications
for Scottish business and industry.
The Action Centre has Lord Kingsdown as its chairman.

SCOTTISHPOWER is switching on to people power. The company's Glasgow
district, part of the distribution and supply division, has achieved the
coveted Investors in People Award, one of only two such awards in the UK
electricity market.
New chief executive Ian Robinson presented the IIP plaque to
ScottishPower fitter Stephen Kerr yesterday at the site of a new sub
station on Glasgow's Broomielaw.
Mr Robinson said: ''Stephen typifies our commitment to IIP as he is
now also being trained as a cable jointer. The benefit to the company is
that we are developing double craftsmen teams who will be capable of a
much more diverse range of tasks.''
New staffing structures and on-going training courses have led to more
effective working practices and a better service for customers.
Since Glasgow district, the largest in the ScottishPower area with
400,000 customers, launched its IIP drive in 1993, there has been a 60%
reduction in customer complaints and an 18% reduction in faults.
Rod Sutherland, acting general manager of Glasgow district, said:
''The programme has been very popular because it gives everyone a direct
say in the kind of training and development they require to help them
reach their full potential, which in turn assists us to achieve our
business objectives.''
A key element of the Investors In People drive has been
ScottishPower's open learning course through which employees, as well as
their immediate families, can access a wide range of development
courses.

IT'S not often that a father asks his son's pal to join him in a
business project, but that is what happened to Graeme McClurkin when
Bill Campbell asked him to join his company.
''I had been working at Strathclyde University as a research assistant
for three years,'' recalls Graeme McClurkin. ''And I was not really into
research. I preferred the real world.''
Graeme joined Bill Campbell in 1990 and is now a director of Praxsys,
the Glasgow-based computer software company, alongside Bill Campbell.
The company has written a wide variety of programs, and Graeme treats
creating a new program the way most people would tackle an easy
crossword. ''I really enjoy writing packages better than anything
else,'' he explains.
Praxsys comes from the Greek word for pragmatic, which is where Bill
Campbell comes in. ''Graeme's job is to design the systems while mine is
to make sure they fit the people,'' says Bill, who launched the company
in 1987.
''I had decided to move more into supplying custom-built information
systems, and I had heard my son John and Graeme talking about this
subject so I knew Graeme knew his subject, and I decided to ask him to
come on board,'' he says.

writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
The number of sales offices is to be reduced from 32 to 12, with the
loss of 75 jobs, though only a handful of these will be in Scotland. The
Glasgow area office will take over responsibility for Aberdeen and the
West of Scotland.
The company explained that investment of #1.5m in new technology was
reducing the need for an administrative network -- annual savings of #3m
are expected to be realised.

THE next seven weeks are crucial to aspirations as one of the most
competitive seasons in years reaches its climax.
Tomorrow's Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup semi-final between Kingussie and
Fort William sets the ball rolling.
The top two north sides will meet in what was generally predicted as
the likeliest line-up for the final, although that view would have been
hotly contested in Oban, where the final will take place, as the locals
have their own designs on the trophy.
On Saturday, however, the main question is how Fort will adapt to
having to play the semi-final at Newtonmore, just three miles from
Kingussie.
There is a possibility of the first all-Badenoch Camanachd Cup final
since 1984, when a historic win over Newtonmore tipped the balance of
power in Badenoch towards Kingussie.
They will start favourites for Saturday's match, but Fort already have
secured a major victory over them this season, in the Keyline MacAulay
Cup a few weeks ago, thus denying Kingussie any chance of the clean
sweep of senior honours.
Extra time will be played if necessary, and highlights are being
screened by the BBC on Sportscene on BBC1 at 11.45 on Saturday evening.
Meanwhile, Oban Camanachd, seeking a ninth successive south cup
championship, meet Glasgow Mid Argyll in the Bank of Scotland Celtic
Society Cup semi-final at Taynuilt.

THE only Scottish swimmer in the British team for this summer's
European Championships, Graeme Smith, will take a year out from
university for his build-up to next year's Olympics in Atlanta.
The Stockport-based 19-year-old has proved his world-class potential,
but realises that a medal chance in the USA will require 100%
commitment. Falkirk-born Smith secured his ticket to the Europeans in
Vienna in August with wins in the 1500m and 400m free-style at last
weekend's trials in Sheffield.
He set a Scottish record and beat 1993 European silver medallist Paul
Palmer in the shorter event -- and dominated from the start in the
1500m.
He takes the final of his first-year accountancy exams at Manchester
University on May 26 -- and that will mark the end of his studies until
the autumn of 1996.
''I was delighted with my performances in Sheffield, but I also know I
can go a lot faster at the Europeans,'' he said.
''I'll be putting in a lot of hard work over the next few weeks and
I'd like to think I have a medal chance in Vienna. Because of my exams,
I'll miss next month's British training camp in Tallahassee. But I hope
to get outdoor training.''
Smith gets through around 90,000m a week in training, and has added
extra power and strength this season.

ON May 1, after an 18-month development programme, Glasgow's Adelaide
Place Baptist Church will open its doors to a new era. And without
discarding its spiritual function, the church buildings will comprise a
unique city-centre commercial complex offering a day-care nursery, guest
house, conference auditorium, self-service restaurant and sandwich bar
in an investment programme that has cost #1.2m.
It was barely five years ago that the Rev Jack Quinn and the
congregation of Adelaide Place Baptist Church faced the prospect of
closing down or somehow finding the finance to repair their magnificent
Victorian building. Despite efforts in previous years to curtail dry rot
and dampness, the building was of the age that demanded a massive
investment to survive.
The congregation faced a dilemma. Would they remain there, in this
their spiritual heart, or sell their church and land to a developer who
might relocate them out of town? They took little time in making up
their minds, and their reasons were clearly outlined in a statement:
''We firmly believe that at this time it is God's will that Adelaide
Place Baptist Church remains in the city centre of Glasgow to be witness
to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.''
Speaking of the decision, Mr Quinn said: ''The congregation felt
strongly they should keep the church as their place of worship and not
let it go the way of so many other church buildings which have
completely lost any connection with religious roots.''
Unlike many of the city's churches which have moved completely into
the secular world, Adelaide Baptist Church will not shed its spiritual
function. It will remain the place of worship for the 100-strong Baptist
congregation, who have been meeting in a local school while the
development work has been going on.
Glasgow Development Agency contributed almost #250,000 in financial
assistance towards the internal and external structural work. The
B-listed building which sits on the corner of Bath Street and Pitt
Street will provide 18 new jobs in its eight-bedroom guest house,
restaurant and sandwich bar, conference centre and nursery complex.
In addition to financial assistance from the GDA, funding was provided
by Historic Scotland and Glasgow City Council, with the remainder raised
by the church and its development group.
Centre director, Mr Sandy Meiklejohn sees the operation as a
commercial venture with five distinct aspects, each with its own
attributes: ''The guest house will be aimed largely at tourists whereas
the nursery is essentially a facility for city centre office-based
people. We hope to attract shoppers to the restaurant and sandwich bar
and our conference area is ideal for holding seminars, displays,
exhibitions, etc.''
The nursery offers day-care for 40 children between the ages of three
and five in bright, spacious apartments which incorporates a quiet room
and wet play/dining area. It will be open between 8.30am and 5.30pm, 50
weeks in the year and is ideal for the working mum who travels into the
city centre. The nursery will be staffed by qualified teachers and
nursery nurses. Weekly fees are #75.
In what used to be the caretaker's rooms and church offices there has
been created a guest house with 20 beds in a mixture of high standard
accommodation that ranges from two family rooms to six single/doubles.
All bedrooms have ensuite facilities and television, telephone and
modern pine furniture.
The family room costs #60 per night but when it is considered that
such a room may hold six people then it surely represents good value for
money. Similarly, the other rooms are charged at #39 for the room for
the night and accommodate two people with some having space for a cot.
Martin Davidson, director of property for the Glasgow Development
Agency made the point that the project involved a number of unique
features: ''Our involvement has helped retain an important listed
city-centre building as well as creating a new commercial venture in
line with a number of economic strategies in the city. And the fact that
the auditorium will remain the focal point for worship is obviously
important for the congregation.''
The design team, led by Gillespies architects, included the KLM
Partnership and Ove Arup and Partners with project management by John
McQuillan Associates. The contractor for the stonework and roof repairs
was Hunter and Clark. For the internal conversion the contractor was
John Cochrane and Co Ltd.
The auditorium area is virtually unchanged and it is here that
conferences and seminars may be held. The area is multi-functional and
with public address system it will be eminently suitable for rallies,
concerts or exhibitions.
In the modern self-service restaurant, glass-fronted display cases
augment the attention to good hygiene in the servery area. Seating has
been arranged on different levels and on occasion the use of old pews
from the church serve as a reminder of where one is. The sandwich bar is
a bonus for those who are employed in nearby offices and its aim is to
prepare, while you wait, fresh sandwiches and rolls with a variety of
fillings.
A focal point in the restaurant is a sculpture commissioned by the
church and which depicts the tree of life. Starting at the bottom with
the foetus, it develops into man, with at the top, an outstretched hand
reaching skywards. It was sculpted by Sara Cunningham-Bell from many
materials which included remnants of the church's organ pipes.
Clearly behind such a venture there has been a great deal of thought,
time and effort, but perhaps Mr Quinn best sums up his church's
aspirations: ''By carrying out the development in this way, we have been
able to retain the long spiritual tradition of the church as well as
providing a range of facilities which will ensure its future and enable
us to play a part in helping the people of Glasgow and contributing to
its economy.''
On Saturday, April 29 at 7pm an evening of praise and celebration will
be held at Adelaide Place Baptist Church and the Rev Dr George Mitchell,
vice-president of the Baptist Union of Scotland will be the guest
speaker. Following this, on May 1, the church is holding an open day and
between 10am and 4pm guided tours of the building will take place where
the facilities can be viewed in all their glory.

TOP seed Pete Sampras was forced to pull out of the Monte Carlo Open
yesterday after having badly twisted his ankle halfway through his
second-round match against Dutchman Paul Haarhuis.
The former world No. 1, who was gearing up for next month's French
Open, sustained the injury while trying to catch a forehand winner from
Haarhuis.
He had taken the first set 6-4, and was in the third game of the
second set when the incident occurred.
Former Wimbledon champion Michael Stich's first-clay court match of
the season ended in disaster when he was beaten in straight sets in the
second round. The German lost 7-6, 6-1 to Austrian Gilbert Schaller.
Other results:
Goran Ivanisevic (Croatia) beat Francisco Clavet (Spain) 3-6, 6-3,
6-4; Marc Rosset (Switzerland) beat Albert Portas (Spain) 6-0, 6-3.
* SCOTTISH No. 1 Michele Mair battled her way into the quarter-finals
of the LTA Satellite tennis tournament at Craiglockhart yesterday.
The Edinburgh player, seeded sixth, made it third time lucky when she
defeated Russian Natasha Egorova 6-3, 6-3 to reach the last eight.
''I've lost to her twice in the past five months -- at Wrexham and at
Sunderland -- so I was pleased to get through,'' she said afterwards.
In the men's singles, Ross Matheson won his first-round match, beating
Dane Patrik Langvardt 7-6, 6-3.

WE knew The Braces had been to Edinburgh, but we hardly expected to
find him next day in a state of such enthusiasm. In our experience,
people who have been to Edinburgh come back looking puzzled, but rarely
enthusiastic. The Braces, though, talked as if he'd had a glimpse of the
promised land. In a way he had.
I reached our coffee table in the Nerd House commissariat part-way
through the conversation, while The Braces was holding forth. The first
phrase I heard was . . . ''2500 wire coathangers!'' I coughed as I sat
down. This is our standard signal to indicate that (1) you've joined the
table, while (2) you don't know what kind of conversational poker is
being played, yet (3) you'd like to be dealt a hand anyway.
The rules are that the others have to give the latecomer a precis of
the conversation so far. It went like this. The Braces had been to
Edinburgh, he'd had a few pints too many in Mather's, he'd gone into the
Royal Scottish Academy, having mistaken the building for a large and
posh public convenience with Doric columns, of the kind you expect to
find in Edinburgh, he'd had to pay rather more than he expected for a
few minutes in a urinal, and the caretaker had handed him a catalogue.
The Braces was dumfoonert. ''Where do I go now?'' he asked the
caretaker. The man pointed, and The Braces found himself in a
well-appointed room along with several well-dressed people of both sexes
-- and 2500 wire coathangers. This was where I came in, and it was also
the beginning of The Braces' road to Damascus.
It turned out that he'd stumbled, literally, into an exhibition
featuring a sculpture by David Mach. This astonishing genius had turned
2500 wire coathangers into a 7ft high bust of a television personality,
and well-dressed people were circling it, studying it intently, mostly
through half-lens glasses looped behind their necks with leather thongs.
Nobody was speaking.
This, said The Braces, was one of the great, surreal, defining moments
of his life. Wire coathangers were the bane of modern existence: you
can't fit them into a bin-bag without bending them double. Yet Mach had
transformed them into the likeness of a celebrity with a #47,000
price-tag.
''Brilliant,'' said The Braces. ''How many times d'you think he had to
go to the dry-cleaners before the sculpture was finished? That's
artistic commitment.''
We sighed, and told him that Mr Mach's buzz was to turn the detritus
of the effluent society into art -- the bald car-tyres, the half-read
newspapers. He didn't have to drive the cars or half-read the newspapers
to find his raw material.
But there was one thing worrying me. I put the question to The Braces.
''It's all right,'' he said, ''I didn't disgrace myself. I found the
toilets in the basement.''
Jet-set Jimmy, whose job as a Nerd House negotiator takes him to such
exotic destinations as Munich and Delaware, is deeply disappointed. He
has discovered that somebody else has already brought out the book he'd
been planning to write for years: Clever Tips for Business Trips.
Jimmy was drowning his sorrows in McSonachan's last night. ''I had
some great ideas to ease the way for the business traveller,'' he said,
''but now they'll never be known. It's not fair.''
Just tell me one, I said. It cost me a large Macallan. But this is
what he told me.
The biggest problem on a long-haul flight is to find yourself sitting
beside the Anxious American. The Anxious American is terrified of
flying, although it takes up a large part of his working life. Solution:
put several large pieces of sticking plaster on your face. When he asks,
say, ''It's ok. A difficult landing, but my luggage was intact.'' He
won't speak for the rest of the flight.

JUNIOR CUP
CAMELON advanced to the OVD Scottish Cup final last night after a 2-1
win over 10-man Lochee United at Tannadice.
They were made to battle all the way by Lochee. But, in the 11th
minute, Camelon showed signs of what was to follow. David Flynn drove
over a cross from the right which was hammered goalwards by Jim Ellis --
but goalkeeper Fitzpatrick saved well.
But the same duo combined two minutes later to give Camelon the
breakthrough. This time Ellis centred for Flynn who steadied himself
before netting from 10 yards.
Lochee's Raymond Smith got the first yellow card when he felled Gary
Smith -- but the Dundee side's indiscipline was to prove more costly
just before the interval.
Defender Jim Smith lashed out at Camelon's George Fairley following a
corner and was dismissed by referee McElhinnie.
In 49 minutes, Alan McGonigal flicked a great pass to Chris McKenzie
who bore down on goal, but Fitzpatrick raced out to block, then thump
the ball clear. But the inevitable was delayed by another four minutes.
Flynn latched on to a throw in from the right before powering a shot
low into the net.
Lochee refused to accept their cup dream was over, and hauled
themselves back into the game with 11 minutes remaining. Jack Ross
flighted over a corner from the right and defender Craig Brown rose to
head home.

WORLD indoor champion Andy Thomson suffered an early setback in his
bid to retain the Mazda International Jack High title in Sydney
yesterday when he lost his opening group match to former world indoor
champion Ian Schuback 9-7, 5-9, 9-8.
Anglo-Scot Thomson, who struggled for most of the match, looked as if
he was about to complete the great escape when, with the scores tied at
8-8 in the deciding set, he drew a back toucher with his penultimate
bowl.
Schuback, however, produced the shot of the match with his final
delivery, ditching the jack and following through for a match-winning
shot.
''I got a lot of rubs to stay alive -- particularly in the deciding
set -- and when I got that good shot in on the last end I thought I was
destined to win it,'' said Thomson.
''Ian, however, played a great bowl and I can't have any complaints.
He played better than I did and deserved to win.''
While Thomson was struggling, Scotland's Richard Corsie, the winner
two years ago, was easing through in straight sets against Australia's
Commonwealth pairs gold medallist Rex Johnston. Corsie won 9-6, 9-4 in a
total of just 16 ends.
''Generally, I played well but the wind made things very difficult,
particularly towards the end,'' he said. ''Winning 2-0 is a real bonus
-- it helps boost the sets and shots differential.''
Ireland's Ian McClure had a rest day and launches his challenge today
when he takes on both Ian Schuback and another of the Australians, Steve
Glasson.
* CONTINUING their improved performance, Scotland's women bowlers
extended their run to three successive wins in the Atlantic Rim fours
championship at Durban yesterday.
Taking a commanding 18-9 lead over Israel, skipped by Maureen
Hirschowitz, Frances Whyte's quartet slipped up over the last three
ends, but still came out on top, by 18-16.
But when they came up against Wales in the afternoon, they found Welsh
skip Betty Morgan at her most dangerous, and, after holding their
opponents to a 7-5 lead at nine ends, dropped 13 shots to three over the
next eight ends to trail 20-8, and went down 23-18.
Janice Maxwell, thrown in at the deep end to replace Sarah Gourlay as
Scotland's singles representative, was involved in a cracking encounter
with Israel's Merle Swerdlow, taking 25 ends to win, 25-23, after the
Israeli was the first to reach 21.
After lunch, Maxwell felt her woods were ill-suited to the rink on
Green C, and did not see the way Welsh star Rita Jones went. Jones, who
won the silver medal in Florida, two years ago, triumphed 25-5.
Gourlay, who has spent the tournament on the bank acting as team
manager, is now reconciled to sitting it out for the rest of the week,
but is hoping to be fit for the start of the national singles
championship a week tomorrow.

NEW RELEASES
Legends of the Fall (15) directed by Edward Zwick
Captives (15) directed by Angela Pope. On general release
Exotica (18) directed by Atom Egoyan. Filmhouse and GFT
Thin Ice (15) directed by Fiona Cunningham Reid. Filmhouse
All films open tomorrow
Unruly they may be, but the boys of the backwoods in William Russell's
film of the week are everything a lady could desire
DELECTABLY daft, Legends of the Fall is one of those doom-laden family
sagas in which a tyrannical pater familias, Anthony Hopkins, rules over
a brood of unruly sons, and a woman gets in the way. The sons are the
usual mixed bunch, who could no more have sprung from Sir Anthony's
loins than swim the Channel. Indeed, they do not have a gene in common,
except blue ones.
They are, however, suitably dishy, and what with Henry (ET) Thomas for
starters, Brad Pitt for seconds, Aidan Quinn for desert and Sir Anthony,
a particularly ripe piece of Camembert, for afters, Legends is a
veritable feast with everything a lady could desire on the menu. Not
that men are left out. For them there is Julia Ormond, a very beautiful
British brunette, as the slightly under-powered femme fatale all three
brothers lust after.
Legends is a film to wallow in, although, that said, it is something
of a disappointment from Edward Zwick, director of that admirable Civil
War epic, Glory. Somewhere there is a rather good tale about brotherly
rivalry and the neuroses of the excessively macho man to be told, but it
is not on the screen.
The film, however, has a lot going for it. The scenery is marvellous,
the symphony orchestra on the soundtrack plays tuneful and lush music
non-stop, and a powerful cast act their hearts out. Boy, do they act.
Based on a novella by Jim Harrison, the film is about the three sons of
a blue-blooded US Cavalry Colonel, William Ludlow (Hopkins), who, unable
to bear the government's policies towards the Indian tribes, settled in
a remote part of Montana in the 1890s to raise his three sons free from
worldly corruption.
Pitt is Tristan, the central figure of the drama, a free spirit who,
as a boy, has a close encounter with a grizzly bear, which shapes his
life. The sons inevitably fall for the same woman, Miss Ormond, but it
is the eldest, Arthur (Quinn), an aspiring politician, who marries her.
When Tristan and Samuel (Thomas) go off to the First World War, Tristan
acts as his brother's keeper, but after Samuel gets killed things are
never the same again, and he goes into a dreadful decline.
An old Cree Indian, One Stab (Gordon Tootoosis), narrates the tale,
and the usual things occur that one expects of a saga: rape, murder,
accidental death, natural disasters, terrible afflictions, wars and
grand passions.
Pitt smoulders nicely as the sort of wandering boy women long to
clutch to their bosoms, and Quinn, wasted as the stuffy, ambitious elder
brother, does his best with a thankless role. The highspot comes when
the colonel has a stroke.
Sir Anthony's rendering of this awful event, meant to be an oak tree
struck down, is rather like Charles Laughton's Hunchback of Notre Dame
as rendered by Frankie Howerd. The saga ends with that grizzly returning
to claim Tristan -- or not -- as the case may be. Legends of the Fall,
both hugely enjoyable and irredeemably silly, is the film of the week.
Atom Egoyan is a difficult director to get to grips with because his
approach to his material tends to be infuriatingly elliptical. Something
interesting is usually going on, but all too often it is happening just
off the edge of the screen. Exotica, his most assured piece to date, is
a bizarre thriller involving a lot of sexual deviation, which ends with
its loose ends very neatly tied up.
The action takes place in and around a peculiar Toronto nightclub
where girls strip for the customers individually. The man hires the girl
of his choice to dance on his table, and may look but not touch. If he
does he is thrown out. Francis (Bruce Greenwood), who is mourning a dead
daughter, is obsessed with one girl, Christina (Mia Kirshner) --
encounters watched over by Eric (Elias Koteas), the jealous club heavy.
Something is afoot, but Egoyan teases as to just what it is, slipping
a scrap of information here, another there, careful, like a stripper,
never to bare all too quickly. The answer is totally unexpected, and
Exotica has been most stylishly photographed by Paul Sarossy. While not
unmissable, this film is well worth trying should past Egoyan films have
proved hard to take.
Thin Ice, a love story about lesbian ice skaters, directed by Fiona
Cunningham Reid, is both tedious and inept, even if its heart is in the
right plae. Not even Sir Ian McKellen, playing himself, although not
very well, can save it, but maybe it was an off day for the knight.
Photographer Steffi (Sabra Williams) has lost her partner and needs
someone to dance with at the Gay Games in New York. She persuades
curtain saleswoman Natalie (Charlotte Avery), who is not gay, to join
her. When the two go on a country weekend with Steffi's journalist
friend, Greg (James Dreyfus), the girls swiftly fall into the sack and
Natalie discovers she, too, is gay.
Big deal, chapesses; pass me my Doc Martens, pierce my ears and shave
my head. The girls fall out after Natalie discovers that Steffi and Greg
have sold a story about dancing dykes to the Observer Colour Magazine
for lots of money, but after a change of heart she goes to New York,
they dance, winning gold, which, given the American competition is a far
from remarkable achievement.
In Captives, a moody little film directed by Angela Pope, the
ubiquitous Julia Ormond plays a neurotic posh lady dentist separated
from her husband (Peter Capaldi, demonstrating his future may well lie
in directing, as a man any woman would be wise to leave, so odd is the
scene in which he more or less appears, it being apparently shot in a
total eclipse) who works two days a week in a prison.
Naturally she falls for one of the prisoners, whose bridgework she is
probing -- a winsome wife murderer played by Tim Roth. The real-life
tendency for well- bred ladies to succumb to the wiles of convicts is
well documented, but few, one hopes, were quite as gormless as Ms Ormond
proves.
She knows she is doing wrong but cannot stop herself, so powerful is
Mr Roth's sex appeal -- some things beggar belief. When the prison nasty
(Colin Salmon) discovers what the love-struck pair are doing in the
lady's loo at Southgate tube station cafe on Roth's days out to attend a
computing class, he tries to blackmail her into smuggling a gun into the
prison along with her dental floss.
There is a good film to be made about the sexual allure of prisoners,
but Miss Pope has not made it. Miss Ormond looks lovely and suffers in
the manner of the young Claire Bloom; Mr Roth does his south London thug
act and flashes a few tattoos, but there really is not much more to be
said about a distinctly debilitating experience. Captives, which feels
like a life sentence, actually lasts only 100 minutes.

The Perrier Pairs
SEVE Ballesteros returns to the European Tour for the Perrier Paris
Pairs Tournament this week and will spend part of his time looking for
another British caddie following his break with Billy Foster at the US
Masters.
The 38-year-old maestro, who is partnering Spanish compatriot Jose
Maria Olazabal at the Saint-Cloud Club starting today, described his
break with Foster after four years as ''a friendly divorce''.
Ballesteros said: ''There were no bad feelings on my side and I don't
think on his side, either. But there were a few things we were not happy
about, so it was better to have a change. This week a Spanish friend of
mine, Javier Carriles, will be my caddie.
''I do not have a replacement in mind yet, but I expect to have
another permanent caddie, almost certainly British, at the Benson and
Hedges tournament next month.''
The Paris format is a fourball on the first day, a foursomes on the
second, a greensomes on the third, and another fourball on the final
day.
Ballesteros considers the tournament useful practice for the Ryder
Cup, but Colin Montgomerie does not agree as the Paris event does not
have the same pressure. But the Scot believes that that his partnership
with Ian Woosnam could give Bernard Gallacher, the captain, another
option in the Ryder Cup.
''People are expecting Nick Faldo and I to continue at Oak Hill, but
options are nice to have,'' said Montgomerie, who is in relaxed mood for
the foursomes and greensomes rounds.
''They will be good for Ian, because he will always be on the fairway
after my drives,'' he quipped.
Woosnam is still troubled by pain in his right shoulder, a legacy of a
holiday accident while water-skiing in Antigua.
Holders Peter Baker and David J Russell are among 60 pairs competing
in Paris, with teams up to those tied for thirtieth place qualifying for
the last two rounds.
Rookies Dean Robertson (Gleddoch) and Craig Ronald (East Kilbride) are
paired together and, apart from them and Montgomerie, the only other
Scot participating is Anglo Bill Longmuir, who partners Mark Stokes.
* RESULTS from the Ladies Golf Union Scottish Challenge Bowls Finals
at Elie yesterday:
Silver (Challenge Bowl): 76 -- Mrs T Gunn (Murrayfield, 10). 77 -- Mrs
E Beith (Douglas Park, 14) bih, Miss S Squire (Earlsferry Thistle, 8).
Scratch (Wallace Williamson Bowl): 84 -- Mrs E Wilson (Elie) bih, Miss J
Flanagan (St Regulus).
Bronze: 77 -- Mrs D Meldrum (Earlsferry Thistle, 30). 80 -- Mrs A
Millar (Vale of Leven, 24). 82 -- Mrs G Anderson (St Rule, 19). Bronze
Scratch Cup: 96 -- Mrs M Lawrie (Earlsferry Thistle).
* THE Scottish Rugby Union-sponsored pro-am, planned for the Ailsa
Course at Turnberry yesterday was cancelled.
SPGA officials confirmed there are no plans to reschedule the event
later in the season.

KEVIN Keegan enrolled Newcastle United into Jimmy White's fan club
last night as the biggest draw in snooker went hunting for title-holder
Stephen Hendry in the #1,132,000 Embassy World Championship.
But despite White's popularity and a huge support for him in the
Crucible Theatre, it was the Scot who took a 5-3 lead after the first
session of their semi-final.
Soccer legend Keegan faxed White a message of support from all at St
James' Park as he embarked on the best-of-31-frames semi-final with the
four-times champion.
''Let's hope this is your year -- you deserve it,'' said the greeting
from Keegan and second-in-command Terry McDermott.
Certainly, if popularity counted towards winning snooker's greatest
prize, White would not still be waiting to take the trophy back to South
London, and he again delighted a full house at Sheffield to flashes of
brilliance.
But, like Steve Davis before him, the 26-year-old Scot knows how to
contend with the down-side of being the world's top player -- that most
people will be supporting his opponent as the underdog, and especially
if the other player is six-times runner-up White.
Just to let White know who was boss, Hendry finished his night's work
with a break of 105. It was his fifth ton of the tournament, his
forty-fifth in the sport's premier event, and No.287 of his career.
White made runs of 71 and 73 as he battled to prevent Hendry securing
too big a lead that could have killed off the contest practically before
it got under way.
Appearing in his first ranking semi-final of the season, the omens
looked promising for world No.4 White in the opening frame.
His first visit to the table resulted in a brilliant red; the second
ended with a 71 clearance to go 1-0 up.
It was the only time in the session Hendry trailed. He levelled at 1-1
with a break of 63 and went 2-1 up with a run of 34 in a scrappy third
frame.
Back came White with a 44 and a 28 to clinch a 2-2 mid-session
scoreline.
After the interval Hendry, whose quarter-final win over Ronnie
O'Sullivan was a record eighteenth in a row at the Crucible, allowed
White just one point in the next two frames. Meanwhile he chalked up 157
points, largely due to runs of 54 and 62.
White's best effort of the session -- a 73 -- reduced his deficit by
one before Hendry sank a superb medium-distance red to begin his 105
clearance to re-establish his two-frame cushion.
The match resumes this afternoon with seven more frames and finishes
tomorrow with two scheduled sessions.
The bookmakers seem in no doubt about the outcome. Hendry was a
rock-solid 1-4 favourite for the match, with White a generous 11-4.
Even before the match the Scot was at 2-5 to achieve a record fourth
world crown in a row and his fifth in all.

SOME 66 years after speedway was first brought to these shores, you'll
be allowed to place a bet on the stars of the shale as they do battle
over Britain's 21 tracks.
The Speedway Control Board have given it the nod, and Peterborough,
home of the famous Panthers, will chalk up the first odds next weekend.
The bookies are already installed, and a licence applied for.
Punters will able to wager on specific races, forecast the 1-2-3, and,
hopefully, take advantage of a handicap list. However, the layers have
already been doing their homework at Peterborough's Alwalton circuit,
and feel they can see a sure thing.
English-based SCB chief Graham Reeve embraced the move, saying: ''I am
looking to forward to a new phase in speedway's future.''
However, Glasgow Tigers' captain David Walsh said: ''I feel it will
distort what the sport's all about. No-one goes to a horse or dog
meeting just to admire the quality of racing. We don't want that to
happen in speedway. Betting will demean the sport, and I don't want any
part of it.''
Scotland's leading rider, Kenny McKinna, was also wary over the SCB
initiative. The Edinburgh Monarchs veteran said: ''I am surprised. It is
bound to be open to abuse among an unscrupulous few -- but it will have
to be properly policed. It might just prove a shot in the arm for the
sport.''
Glasgow promoter Douglas Hopes said: ''As long as it does not bring
the wrong sort along, I'll give it a chance.''
If you could already place a bet, Tigers would surely be worth an
investment in tonight's Knock-out Cup second-leg tie against
Middlesbrough. Defending a 63-43 lead from Sunday's opener at Shawfield,
skipper Walsh and his men look on course for another decent run in the
competition.

Brad Pitt's flowing locks have been cropped for his latest screen role
-- but Hollywood's new hot property is still a cut above, reports
WILLIAM RUSSELL
BRAD PITT in the flesh is a gangling young man with an amiable smile
whose hair is currently cut short for his most recent role as a
policeman in a film with Morgan Freeman called Seven.
His trademark flowing locks had to be sacrificed for the sake of
authenticity. He seemed mildly embarrassed by his status as the reigning
Hollywood male sex symbol, but enjoying it as well. Move over Cruise.
Pitt's time has come, as Legends of the Fall, the film he was in Britain
on Tuesday to promote, demonstrates.
It may have Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn in meaty roles sharing
above-the-title billing, but Pitt is its putting-the-bottoms-on-seats
star. He made his name as the sexy hustler in Thelma and Louise who
robbed Gina Davis, went on to consolidate his position as the coming man
in Robert Redford's hymn to fly fishing, A River Runs Through It, showed
his versatility as a psychopathic killer in Kalifornia, and then stole
such of the show worth stealing from Tom Cruise in Interview with the
Vampire.
On being a sex god, he said that everyone got that label sooner or
later in Hollywood, which is not strictly true, but implied a certain
modesty in the man which was attractive. ''It is not the focus of my
life, it is something you have to put up with,'' he said. ''It is very
nice. How could you not enjoy it?'' Had he not just been voted the
sexiest man in the movies? ''Yes, but that was in People magazine,'' he
said, dismissing the accolade.
He was not worried about getting typecast, and it was not something he
thought about, he said. He liked to vary his roles, had not thought
about getting parts just for his looks, and enjoyed trying something
different, to see whether he could sink or swim. He denied that he had
agreed to attend Tuesday's royal charity premiere because Prince Charles
had insisted he be there. ''I have never met the man,'' he said. ''I am
looking forward to it. It is history, right?''
How had it been acting with Hopkins? ''He is the king. It was an
honour working with him,'' he said. ''He has a very powerful presence.
He is an amazing man, a lion.''
As for his short-back-and-sides haircut, in contrast to the flowing
locks he sports throughout Legends, even when he goes to the Western
Front in the First World War, it had been written into his contract for
Interview with the Vampire that he must not have them cut, he said. If
he was to be able to make Legends they were not to ''mess with the boy's
hair''. He didn't actually say mess, but it gets his point across.
The films had been made back-to-back and shooting of Interview had
been put back two weeks to allow him to finish Legends, he added.
''Doing that was a drain. You have to have time to recover after making
a film and it was a matter of going into that one tired.''
As for the fact that he is now in the big-money league as an actor, he
admitted that sums actors could earn were crazy, but films were
business. It was a business he did not really understand just yet, but
it was a question of what a movie brought in and whether you were worth
it.
''If someone is going to give a lot of money to you are you going to
say no? Of course not.'' And he admitted that he had in earlier days
dressed up as a chicken as an advertising promotion. ''You do what you
can to put food on the table,'' he said. ''It meant standing on the
street corner in 100-degree weather having cars trying to flip you off.
I was getting about seven bucks an hour.''
He refused to be drawn on his love life, except to repeat firmly ''I
have never been happier'' to all the questions. He did, however, get
somewhat upset when somebody recalled that he and his Legends co-star,
Julia Ormond, were said to have shared a log cabin on location. He had
treated the question at first as a joke, remarking that he had been
single at the time, then realised the implications and insisted it had
been a question of shortage of accommodation.
There had only been a few log cabins in the valley where they were
filming, and living on the set saved time because it was a three-hour
trip from the nearest town. ''It was very good, very clean, and we are
good friends,'' he added.

IF THE battle for second spot in the premier division is intense, then
the race for the first-division championship, and automatic entry to the
top flight, is red hot. The consolation prize for the runners-up is a
play-off place against second-bottom in the premier, and, for the two
unfortunates, another season of torment in a division from which it is
hard to escape.
The difference between success and failure for Raith Rovers, Dundee,
Dunfermline, and Airdrie will be costly, both in terms of finance and
the development of talent.
Dunfermline, who missed out last season by just one point, despite
being the highest-scoring side in the country, appear to have the
toughest run-in -- Scottish Cup finalists Airdrie and Clydebank at home,
and Fife neighbours Raith Rovers away.
Party-poopers are lurking. St Johnstone expected to be involved at the
sharp end, but their form has come too late. They will, however, have a
big say in the outcome, because they have to meet Raith, Dundee, and
Dunfermline.
Hamilton, managed by Iain Munro, who has already held the reins at
both Dens Park and East End Park, could wreck the hopes of Raith,
Airdrie, or both.
Munro is rarely without an opinion about football. But ask him, as I
did, who would finish in the top two places and he will tell you: ''If I
was asked to put money on it, I wouldn't. You would have to perm any two
from four. I could name the two clubs I fancy today and you could ask me
the same question on Sunday and I would name the other two -- it's that
close.
''All four sides in contention have a good balance of quality and hard
workers. Raith and Dundee maybe have the better blend of youth and
experience, but Airdrie and Dunfermline have been over the course
before. You could put up a good argument for all of them.
''In the end it will all come down to three things. Who keeps their
nerve, who can avoid injuries and, finally, which club can steer clear
of suspensions.
''There are those who say that, because Dunfermline came so close last
time, they will bottle it. If they fail again, it certainly won't be
because they bottled it. Their biggest danger is if they become too
anxious.
''Of course, we will have a say in the issue, because we have to play
both Airdrie and Raith Rovers, and I believe we are probably the most
dangerous side in the division. We have enough talent to cause anyone
problems, and there is absolutely no pressure on us.''

SCOPE and choice within bridal wear is widening but there does
generally seem to be one tenet of faith which is very rarely deviated
from. A bride's attire is a gown or robe or whatever other word one
conjures up for . . . a dress.
Trousers may be gaining ground in terms of acceptability, but the
frisson as a bride goes up the aisle in the best-of-taste palazzo pants
is not entirely one of approbation. A wedding at its biggest and best is
a collection of two families of all generations and not everyone will
applaud an unorthodox stride to the altar.
Styles, however, are changing which means that brides now have a wide
berth of options in dress designs from the fairytale variations to
sexier numbers and elegant simplicity recalling Audrey Hepburn.
Brides therefore have greater scope than ever before for individuality
within the traditional demand for a dress on their big day, but a dress
can be a dress and cope with other additions for a more vital and
adaptable look.
Jackets have long been commonplace for bridesmaids, pages and flower
girls but their use with bridal gowns has tended to be on the sparse
side, which is remarkable in a country with Scotland's climate. Jackets
represent a practical option when faced with the uncertainty of spring
or autumn days, which have an identity problem and are trying every
season.
Given that our summer days are not exactly always au fait with their
place in the climatic calendar, jackets really represent a year-round
practical possibility for brides who do not want to feel like a giant
gooseberry in their wedding photographs.
Winter brides have of course tended to make more use of jackets,
particularly in the new riding look of the past few seasons which has
made bridal jackets not only acceptable but de rigueur. As the weather
does slowly give way to a few strains of sunshine, bolero jackets
represent a lighter and perhaps more comfortable option.
Another aspect of the jacket is the simplicity with which it answers
the modern bride's dilemma of how to look sweetly chaste and not too
bosomy before the vestry and alluringly sophisticated at the reception.
Before the minister or the priest a jacket will cover any overt shows of
flesh, then it can be whipped off later to reveal a dashing halter-neck
design as the happy couple tango on the dance floor.
Modern women, of course, have to cope with other questions of duality
in an age -- or should that be at an age -- when mothers may still be
calling for their little girl to dress up for her big day, but the
little girl, who is in her thirties, would feel happier with something
simpler. Women who steer towards the implicitly simple can dress up a
straight gown with a bolero jacket decked with some of the trimmings
from piping to floral additions, braiding and tassels for a solution
which will appease both camps and not trap the bride in fancy additions
all day.
Jackets can also take the strain for brides who want to dabble with
the latest design trends but may not want to go the whole hog, defined
throughout by what may be perceived later as a very dated fad. A case in
point is the current fashion fixation with the fifties tailored outfit.
In the bridal market this has been translated largely into the Audrey
Hepburn-inspired empire line dress, cut-off below the bust, a design
which is very difficult for the average figure to carry off with any
great aplomb.
The solution for some would be a simple, elegant, tailored dress
topped by a fifties-style short, straight, round-collared jacket. It
will strike the right note without undermining the modern figure.
Little lace boleros also offer a chance to dress up simple silk gowns
and make them rich enough for the occasion with the requisite feminine
touch, while ensuring that dress beneath can then be revealed for the
reception or go unjacketed to a posh dinner dance at another time.
Suits, of course, have long been a staple of the second-time-around
bride, but young and first-timers should also check out the emerging
newer-look design which puts dresses with slimline jackets meant to be
worn open and loose.
Again there is the jacket as an integral part of the outfit, designed
to be worn tight and closed over, atop chiffon and pleated skirts. This
time-honoured look for registry brides has been gaining acceptance --
albeit with short sleeves -- for the tropical wedding, which in turn
means we may seem more brides at less formal weddings wearing natty
summer-style suits as well as the guests.

DUNFERMLINE players Marc Millar and Stewart Petrie had a narrow escape
yesterday when a car in which they were travelling lost control and hit
a lorry on the A9 five miles south of Aviemore. The pair were taken to
Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and released after treatment.
Millar, who was driving, was more seriously injured and will miss
Saturday's vital promotion clash with Airdrie. Petrie was badly shaken
up and a decision will be made on his fitness later in the week. The
car, owned by Millar, is believed to have been written off in the
accident.

<TEXT>
WALES manager Mike Smith brought relief to Crystal Palace fans by
revealing the collarbone injury which forced Chris Coleman out of his
team's fine 1-1 draw last night in Germany was not as bad as first
feared.
Coleman fell awkwardly when challenging Heiko Herrlich just before the
big striker cancelled out Dean Saunders' seventh-minute opener early in
the second half.
The defender was rushed away from the Rhein Stadium in agony -- but an
X-ray showed there was no fracture.
''We thought he'd broken it at first,'' said Smith. ''But although he
is still in great pain, we think he's only sprained it.''
Smith was convinced that it was only the injury to the Selhurst Park
man which denied the Welsh victory over Bertie Vogts' side.
''That cost us an historic win,'' he claimed. ''You would normally
expect Chris to deal easily with a ball hit in from 45 yards, although
perhaps Mark Bowen should not have left it when he saw it coming in
towards Herrlich.''
The goal aside, Smith was rightly delighted with the effort and
application of the Welsh, for whom Neville Southall was another hero
with a superb goalkeeping display which denied Jurgen Klinsmann time and
again.
* GERRY Armstrong, hero of Northern Ireland's finest hour on foreign
soil, last night acclaimed the unbeaten away form that is maintaining
the current team's hopes of European Championship qualification.
Iain Dowie's second-half penalty sealed all three points from Latvia
with a 1-0 win for Bryan Hamilton's team.
As the man whose winning goal against Spain in Valencia spurred
Northern Ireland on to reach the last eight of the 1992 World Cup
finals, Hamilton's assistant Armstrong knows all about the importance of
resilience away from Belfast.
He said: ''We had four forced changes from the team which played in
Dublin and two lads -- Wrexham's Barry Hunter and Kevin Horlock of
Swindon -- did absolutely brilliantly. Both got stuck in and that spirit
ran right through the team.''
* A BIZARRE own goal by Portuguese keeper Vitor Baia handed the
Republic of Ireland a vital Lansdowne Road win.
But there was no fluke about the way they carved out a fully-deserved
1-0 triumph to go back on top of Group 6.
Jack Charlton's team answered his call for a return to their old style
pressing game with total commitment.
That was just too much for their classy visitors who suffered their
first defeat of the competition -- but will clearly remain in contention
for the finals.
On this occasion, however, their sophisticated, close passing
possession game was knocked out of its stride by the traditional
hustling methods which originally made Ireland a feared force under
Charlton's nine-year command.
It needed a touch of outrageous fortune, though, to settle the issue
in the closing seconds of the first half.
After Steve Staunton and Niall Quinn linked on the left, Staunton
drove in a low cross through the legs of Portugal's captain Joao Pinto
and goalkeeper Baia was thrown into confusion by John Aldridge's lunge
at the near post.
The ball appeared to strike Baia on the elbow before it trickled over
the line.

DYING in battle for your country, even in these unheroic days, is
still accorded a degree of dignity. But what of those who survive? What
of their dignity when, maimed in mind or body or both, they are
frequently discarded by the institution which has demanded so much of
them and given so little back? R C Sherriff's First World War drama,
Journeys End, was perhaps one of the first dramas to raise uncomfortable
questions about the traumatic and largely unspoken effects of war on
men.
Now Our Boys, written by ex-solider Jonathan Lewis, takes another
tack. Set in one of the wards of the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital
in 1984, Lewis brings together a motley crew of injured veterans
recovering not just from the Falklands campaign but also Northern
Ireland and IRA attacks in London. Less a play about war itself, Our
Boys is really a savage indictment of the Army as a ruthlessly uncaring
machine but also an absorbing examination of the complex dynamics that
make up male camraderie.
Frequently outrageous, Lewis has also caught all the ferocious,
dead-pan (obsessively bed-pan) humour of various classes of men thrown
together by adversity revealing the strains of past experiences and an
uncertain future to come through a stream of put-downs and oddly
supportive insults.
Performed with searing intensity in this Derby Playhouse revival (it
was first staged a couple of years ago at the Soho Cockpit where it won
both best play and acting fringe awards), it makes for vivid, wholly
magnetic theatre -- a fitting tribute to all those destroyed by the
military ethos of denial and secrecy.

THREE correspondents have finally defeated almost 60 years of trying
to keep at least one toe in the door of Christian community against all
my better intuitions (April 20).
I read somewhere that a Fundamentalist Christian is an Evangelical
Christian who is angry about something. On the evidence of Mr McKay's
letter and that of the Rev Aidan Martin what they are angry about is
that anyone should disagree with their interpretations of the meaning of
scripture and tradition. Nothing infuriates such souls so much as sweet
reasonableness and humanity.
When Eleanor Liddle talks about ''knowing Jesus personally'' does she
mean it literally or is it ''just a way of talking''? If it is just a
way of talking why does she think the Jesus that Stewart Lamont ''knows
personally'' has to be the same as the one she does?
Stewart Lamont is the main reason I now take your paper regularly. I
enjoyed his articles and regarded him as offering some hope that there
might be a reasonable future for the continuation of the liberal
Presbyterian tradition of my ancestors which was expressed
metaphorically and ethically in their lives.
I also allowed myself to entertain the vague notion that I might one
day stumble into a Church in which I felt comfortable. If your
correspondents have their way, the tradition will disappear beneath an
avalanche of aggressive fundamentalism and such churches will have no
hope of existing.
This particular camel may or may not be able to wriggle through the
eye of a needle, but these three wisps of wind-blown straw caught in
your pages have contrived to break its back.
I look forward to the day when theology is treated with no more, nay,
much less, respect in Scottish universities than astrology currently is
and when the reading of Scripture is never more than an act of literary
curiosity or cultural archaeology.

Stewart Lamont relates how a court ruling re-affirms the Church of
Scotland's right to be 'master in its own house'
RENDER unto the civil court what belongs to the State and unto the
Kirk what belongeth to it. Thus sayeth the Lord Osborne. The independent
jurisdiction of the Church of Scotland from the civil courts which took
centuries of civil war, strife and argument to establish was yesterday
put in writing by a Court of Session judge.
The circumstances of Lord Osborne's judgment were hardly historic. He
had been asked to grant an interim interdict to freeze the suspension
that Dumbarton Presbytery had imposed on one of its ministers (Rev Tom
Logan of Abbotsford Church, Clydebank) who faced discipline charges for
allegedly disobeying an instruction to refrain from promoting the
networking business, Amway.
This loosed the wrath of the Kirk, whose legal officials bounced into
his court a week later and pointed out that the 1921 Church of Scotland
Act spelt out their right to be masters in their own house. Lord Osborne
reserved his judgment and yesterday sided with the Kirk in the clearest
possible terms.
In one sense, the affair has thus been a waste of everyone's time, the
only apparent gain being a temporary breathing space to Mr Logan before
the Presbytery resumes its proceedings against him. On the other hand,
an opportunity has been given to highlight the unique and unusual status
which the Kirk enjoys within the British constitution and to view it
within the modern context of industrial tribunals, judicial reviews and
appeals to the court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
The significance of Lord Osborne's 34-page opinion can be summed up in
two sentences: ''The courts of the Church of Scotland cannot be
equiparated (treated as equivalent) with any tribunal created or upon
which a power has been conferred by parliament.''
And secondly: ''The Act of 1921 was a recognition by Parliament of
certain pre-existing powers in the Church of Scotland, rather than the
conferring of powers upon it.''
In other words, whether or not you think it is fair, modern or moral,
the Kirk can hire, fire and transfer its ministers without them being
able to appeal to a civil court or industrial tribunal.
Further, the Church of Scotland as national church (and no other
denomination) enjoys independent status and cannot be subject to the
courts, Parliament or even the monarch when it is dealing with matters
spiritual (including discipline of its officebearers or defining their
sphere of labour).
Naturally the Kirk's legal eagles are soaring with joy about the
decision. Had Lord Osborne not supported them, then feathers would
undoubtedly have flown. The Presbytery would have been forced to defy
the Court of Session -- if it truly believed there was no jurisdiction,
then it would have had to act in accordance with that. It also would
have made nonsense of the 1921 Act which, even allowing for the rhetoric
of the Articles Declaratory (which define the Kirk's view of itself as
fireproof from civil courts) is crystal clear.
Yesterday Rev John Cairns, the minister who is conducting the
Presbytery's case against Mr Logan and who is also convener of the
Kirk's own ''High Court'', the Judicial Commission, said: ''I am not
surprised at the outcome.''
Mr Logan's lawyer, Mr Colin Cameron of Irvine, said he was studying
the judgment and would comment tomorrow.
Meanwhile, Mr Logan must now accept suspension or face a more serious
charge of contumacy (wilful disobedience), and Dumbarton Presbytery will
decide at its meeting next Tuesday when to proceed with his trial. The
original intention had been to remit the case to a tribunal of three
convened by Rev Alastair Symington of New Kilpatrick, Bearsden.
Provided the tribunal reached a unanimous verdict, it could decide the
case without it coming before the whole Presbytery. However, there is
now the possibility that previous charges against Mr Logan could take
second place to a charge of having breached his ordination vow to be
subject to the courts of the church, by his action in the Court of
Session. There is a precedent last century of a Cardross minister who
was dismissed for this very offence.
It is unlikely that a verdict could be reached before the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland in May and Mr Logan would have the
right, if found guilty and deposed as minister, to appeal to the
Judicial Commission. Its verdict would go to the 1996 Assembly. Many
would consider this a long time for the people of Abbotsford to wait
while the fate of their minister was decided. Yet they would wait even
longer if Mr Logan and his lawyer try to use the Strasbourg Court of
Human Rights to breach the 1921 Act, now possibly their only remaining
avenue. Were Strasbourg to claim jurisdiction this would be as welcome
as a crate of Colorado beetles being landed in a potato farm.
Which brings me to the final issue which emerges from the whole affair
-- can the Kirk maintain the status which the 1921 Act gives it? As it
stands, if the Kirk made some ridiculous decision or huge miscarriage of
justice there is no redress to civil law. Unless the General Assembly
puts it right, there the matter rests.
Some senior lawyers are doubtful that an Act which was based on a
series of historical events leading up to 1921, can continue into the
21st century to bestow a status accorded no other church or
organisation. They point out that there was no such thing as human
rights law in 1921, nor any body comparable to European Courts.
The issue is then not whether Lord Osborne is right (he patently is,
according to the law of Scotland) but whether the Kirk will be able to
hang on to this dearly-prized principle of independence from civil
jurisdiction in a world which increasingly insists on ''multi-cultural''
norms being applied to all religions and treating Christianity (far less
one of its denominations) as one of the choices in the market-place.
Such a world abhors anomalies, and is liable to view the Kirk's status
as a privilege which ought to be challenged.

EARLY in my local government experience I was opposed by a chap who
stood for the Free Beer for Students Party. Another of my opponents
listed, in the description of candidate section, ''5ft 10ins, brown
eyes, 12 stones 2lbs''. Neither of these people took too many votes.
Nor did a Labour councillor of many years standing, a decent cove by
the name of Donald Swanson, when he fell out with his party and stood as
an Independent. Yet that is what many folk advise we should do; drop the
party labels, take politics out of local government, go Independent or
Progressive or Moderate or Ratepayers' Party. It is a load of nonsense
really.
Some of my good friends are Independents. The current convener of
Highland, Duncan McPherson, is one -- he invariably keeps our spirits up
at the Committee of the Regions in Brussels. In his area there is a long
history of Independents standing for councils and, as long as the
electorate favour the idea, I see no reason for change. Nor any for the
rest of the country to follow that example.
For there are just as many dopey Independents as there are party
hacks. The concept of an Independent Group has all the credence of
Catholic Comprehensive schools. At least with the labels on you have
some idea of what you are buying.
I caused much merriment in certain quarters by putting Colinton
Conservative Councillor on the ballot paper this time (as I did in
1975). But that is exactly what I was and have been for the past 25
years. I included a picture of Malcolm Rifkind in my election address so
I don't think there was much difficulty in recognising my affiliation.
Edinburgh's most famous Independent was a flamboyant character called
Douglas Kidd. He had a most voracious appetite for personal publicity
and his best-remembered campaign, which brought furious protests and
threats of strikes, was a tirade against fat bus conductresses.
Now we have another worthy with, officially at least, no political
leanings -- have you ever met a candidate like that? -- but certainly
with the ability to shape events. Councillor Ian Pearce, variously
described as a Residents' Association representative and as an
Independent, is the controlling figure in the new East Renfrewshire
authority.
There are nine Tories, eight Labour, two Lib-Dems, and good old Ian.
When it came to deciding who was going to run the show it was always
odds-on that the Libs would line up with Labour. When Mr Blair finally
pinches all their clothes the Libs may wonder why nobody needs them any
more.
But what did Councillor Pearce do, given the golden opportunity to
bring his influence to bear? Well . . . nothing, actually.
What did you do in the Great War, Grandad? I abstained, child.
And that is what our Ian did. In the sure and certain knowledge that
his inactivity would result in a Labour administration, he sat on his
bum.
For this brave and decisive action Councillor Pearce was hailed as a
hero. Indeed I am surprised he has not been knighted by now. After all,
he showed ''commendable responsibility'', according to the daftest of
our daily journals.
Would we could all achieve such popularity just by abstaining.
Unfortunately though, somebody has to take decisions and I thought that
was why we got elected in the first place.
I would have had a lot more respect for the good councillor if he had
got up and voted with the Labour Party. Did the people who took the
trouble to vote for him expect him to play the invisible man? As for the
East Renfrewshire Tories, who were still desperate to be nice to Ian
after the event, they are only reaping what they sowed. For they, and
Labour, gave Mr Pearce a free run in the Netherlee seat. Only the SNP
opposed him, and well done them.
There are three main reasons I believe political parties should
contest local elections. The most important is that the electorate
should be offered a set of policies which are likely to be followed by a
group on the council. Elected members should be accountable.
They could be taken to task for their financial decisions by the
voters more easily if local government were to raise a greater share of
its own spending money -- rate-capping was one of the Conservative
Government's daftest measures, but that is another argument.
Secondly, it is a political decision how millions of pounds of public
money is spent, or even saved. Councils are actually big businesses, the
largest employers in many areas. If there are to be no parties in town
halls, why should there be in any other form of government?
Thirdly it costs money to fight elections, cash that is often raised
from party members. If I wish to send a newsletter to my residents the
bill comes to well over #200 a time.
Local government must never go back to the days when only the well-off
could stand. I well remember when seats could be bought and sold, when
it was Jimmy's turn to be provost, when the controlling group in
Edinburgh were in the hands of the builders, when the press and public
were banned from all sub-committee meetings. These weren't political
people, of course, who ran the show; just rich.
Dash it -- there's the division bell. Excuse me just a minute while I
just nip out and abstain at the finance committee.

TUESDAY night at the Moir Hall seemed like old times at the Glasgow
Society of Musicians, as top tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton made his
debut for the Jazz Co-op, the recently formed reincarnation of the
society.
Originally scheduled to play Glasgow a month ago, Hamilton withdrew at
the last minute -- a move that has probably done the Co-op more good
than harm. Not only did they come up with a worthy replacement
(trombonist Roy Williams), but they also offered refunds and the
information that Hamilton would indeed honour his commitment in the near
future.
Which he did on Tuesday. And how. It's a long time since Scottish jazz
fans have heard Hamilton doing an entire gig as a solo artist, and it
was a treat to hear his smooth and sultry tenor lend its rich tones to
ballads like the deeply and supremely romantic I Can't Get Started and
the ever-exquisite Skylark.
There were, however, three not insignificant factors in the
saxophonist's above-even-his-average playing: ubiquitous bass player
Ronnie Rae, pianist Dave Millican and drummer Tony MacLennan. This
splendid rhythm section coped perfectly with Hamilton's often
unannounced changes of direction: from the lush lament of Billy
Strayhorn's Chelsea Bridge, Hamilton went into Illinois Jaquet mode with
an uninterrupted marathon of bop -- a fingerbusting filibuster which
really should have caused steam to rise from the horn.
The last, perfect, number said it all: Tonight I Shall Sleep With a
Smile On My Face. If he did, he wouldn't have been the only one.

JOHN McFall, MP for Dumbarton, received a letter which had made its
way to the House of Commons via a circuitous route. Not surprising since
it was addressed to ''John McFall, MP, Parliament House, Parliament
Square, Edinburgh''.
Mr McFall, a bit of a campaigner for a Scottish parliament, was doubly
intrigued since the letter had come from the offices of Ross Harper, the
lawyer who is also a leading light in the Tory Party in Scotland. The
Post Office was in no doubt, however. ''Not Edinburgh. Try Westminster,
London'' was the message scrawled on the envelope.
* ON the subject of Tories and a Scottish parliament,
arch-Conservative journalist Simon Heffer, writing in the Daily
Telegraph, advocated a referendum on Scottish independence. Reading
between the lines, it is clear Mr Heffer believes many Scots would not
have the stomach to vote Yes and would opt for maintaining the Union. He
went on to underline his view of this union between Scotland and
England: ''Divide and rule has been the means of ruling empires, however
small, since classical times . . .''
Back to the wild
WE read in Clydebank District Council's newsletter of the delights of
the ''wide range of natural attractions at Achnacraig Country Park''
where ''many species of indigenous flora and fauna have been newly
planted . . .'' All Clydebank animals take heed.
Definitive drunk
A DEBATE in the Washington state legislature, as reported in the
Seattle Herald, has been brought to our attention. The house was
considering a Bill making it illegal for a drunken person to buy liquor.
But first representatives had to define drunkenness.
Republican Dave Chappell came up with an amendment which narrowed an
excess of bevvy consumption down to one or more of the following
characteristics. Read them and perhaps recognise yourself:
* Being overly friendly, bragging, or talking too loudly.
* Buying rounds for strangers or the house, lighting more than one
cigarette at a time, lacking the ability to light a cigarette.
* Losing train of thought (stopping in mid-sentence), slurring speech
or speaking very slowly and deliberately.
* Spilling drink, missing mouth with glass.
* Arguing with employees or other customers, using foul language,
appearing sullen or uncommunicative except when buying drinks.
Most of the above are quite routine manifestations of a state of
inebriation. We prefer the more exotic. Like the Glasgow man, who will
remain nameless, who ended a night of over-refreshment by making a wee
pillow out of his jacket. He then carefully placed his watch, glasses,
and wallet beside the jacket. He lay down and fell asleep oblivious to
the fact that he was at a bus stop in Hope Street.
We are absolutely certain that readers have their own examples of
evidence of drunkenness which they may like to submit to the Diary at
the usual address and for which they may well win a prize which may well
be strong drink.
Thirst for knowledge
WE have had further requests for information on the subject of the
Diary's party in Glasgow on Saturday to celebrate Bud Neill Day and the
third anniversary of the unveiling of the now legendary Lobey Dosser
two-legged equestrian statue.
Do these dear readers want more information on the cultural input to
the event from Cliff Hanley who will deliver the first annual Lobey
Dosser lecture? Do they want to know if Walter McCorrisken has written
more worse poems than last year? Do they want to know if the Frank
O'Hagan Cowboy Band will be doing other than country music?
No. They want to know if the venue, the Halt Bar, 160 Woodlands Road,
will again be offering cheap drink. And will there be free stovies? The
answer is yes, beer and lager will be #1.20 a pint and a malt whisky
will also be available at #1.20 a shot. And yes there will be free
stovies.
For those who didn't ask, the Frank O'Hagan band has gone very cowboy.
It is now a six-piece, incorporating four members of a band called
Trampus who are world famous in Scotland for hoe-down music.
Mr O'Hagan, musical director of the Lobey Dosser Foundation, was
inspired to follow this route after seeing Bob Dylan in concert. We can
hardly wait but will have to until the celebrations get under way at 2pm
on Saturday.
Going by the Book
THE following court case is not exactly hold-the-front-page material
but it gives a flavour of how life is lived in Stornoway. The case
involved one Donald Morrison, aged 80, who was charged with driving
without due care and attention in that he collided with a car driven by
a chap also called Donald Morrison.
The first Donald was found guilty and his lawyer, Mr Ken Macdonald,
said in mitigation: ''Both drivers are second cousins and both are
elders in the Free Church. I think, therefore, the conversation would
have been fairly muted after the accident.''
The Diary, naturally, has a complete transcript of the conversation in
question:
Bang! Crash! Sound of breaking glass and rending metal.
Donald: ''It's you Donald.''
Donald: ''Ach, it's yourself.''
Donald: ''It's a terrible business.''
Donald: ''The Lord works in mysterious ways his miracles to perform .
. .''
Sound of police siren.
Donald: ''Here's young Donald the polisman. He'll sort it out . . .''
Young Donald the Polisman: ''OK. Assume the position. You're nicked.''
Short straw
WE have in front of us a copy of MEP Winnie Ewing's European Report
for March. This document, presumably issued by Madame Ecosse to keep her
Highland constituents informed of her many doings, begins:
March 3 -- ''Attended luncheon at Pauls maltings, Buckie, where I met
heads of all related industries and discussed problems of EU
directives.''
The next week -- ''Off duties (except, of course, paper work) to
recuperate.''
It's dirty work but someone's got to do it.
The above fur garment, advertised in the Largs and Millport Weekly
News, appears to have been as fatal for its human owner as the skins
were for the original beasties.

THE WASPS Gallery is hidden in a cul-de-sac off Stockbridge in
Edinburgh but don't be put off as there are real delights to find for
anyone who makes the trip. Ian MacIntyre's work, showing last weekend,
is typical. Made up primarily of lino cuts, but including watercolours
and oils, his work has unique exuberance and humour. His themes are
almost all connected with his childhood and life in the north of
Scotland.
The lino cuts are jazzy delights with surreal colours picking out
every detail. Lino cuts are a painstaking media to work in, each cut has
to be planned and printed stage by stage, but MacIntyre's lively
creations give no indication of the effort involved.
Typical of these is Beating which uses gaudy checks and strips of
green, black, and purple to describe the full fury of a day's shooting.
The firing guns sprout stripes of colour while the beaters and marksmen
are picked out in dazzling checks. The Kenmore-Aberfeldy Raft Race is a
swirl of waves, hills, and wide-eyed, grinning participants in oranges,
reds, and yellows.
A whole series of watercolours centre on his family garden and its
wheelbarrow; he splits the pictures with disjointed half circles of
different colours, and mismatchings of legs, feet, and parts of houses.
His other great preoccupation is with the countryside, particularly
around Perthshire -- abstract patterns of forests and lochs.
Favouring two-dimensional format, his pictures are like parts of
friezes running around the gallery's space, but full of movement and
life. To see more of Ian MacIntyre's work visit the Printmakers'
Workshop, Edinburgh, where he is a regular exhibitor.

RETAILING has certainly been one of our more dynamic industries in
recent years. Much of the change has been brought about by the arrival
of overseas operators to our shores who have shaken our home-based
retailers out of their complacency. One thinks of the likes of The Gap,
Toys R Us, Ikea, and more recently the discount food retailers Aldi and
Netto.
Along with the arrival of these newcomers there have been profound
changes in the nature of retailing itself. The out-of-town retail park
has proved to be a mecca for shoppers even when times are supposedly
tough. These American-style shopping malls, with their shops, cafes, and
children's play areas, have been instrumental in turning a trip to the
shops into a day out for the family.
The trading environment for all retailers has been difficult since
last autumn. Retail sales are sluggish, which is perhaps not surprising
given that cash is in shorter supply following the tax increases that
came into effect this month. Added to which the enthusiasm for the
National Lottery is such that #100m a week is disappearing into Camelot,
money that probably would otherwise have been spent at the shops.
The High Street, with its traditional mix of national multiple chains
and small independent shopkeepers, appeared to be doomed. But as is
often the case, talk of its death was premature. A lifeline was thrown
to High Street operators from an unlikely source, John Gummer, Secretary
of State for the Environment. For once the Government appears to have
decided that an unfettered free market is not wholly desirable. Tighter
planning regulations mean the growth of out-of-town retail parks has
been checked.
Personally, I think it is important that investment continues to be
made in our High Streets by both retailers and local authorities. There
has been a steady migration of people from towns to the countryside but
it is vital that city centres are kept attractive and vibrant for there
to be a sense of community. Although resources are under presure I am
sure more could be done to improve the attractiveness of town centres.
Flower displays, street markets, performance artists, children's
activity areas, cafes, and a mixture of pedestrianised areas and
surface-level parking could all help.
Many people, particularly the elderly and those without access to
cars, rely on their High Street for their shopping needs. The change in
the planning environment provides an opportunity for High Street
retailers to tempt back some of the out-of-town shoppers.
All retailers have to work harder than ever to encourage people to
part with their cash. There are still an amazing number who seem to
think they are doing us a favour by being there and for whom the words
''customer service'' have a hollow ring. However, the more astute
realise that they have to offer an attractive package to consumers.
Some of our biggest names in retailing, including House of Fraser,
Marks &amp; Spencer, and Sears, which has more than 15 trading names
including Dolcis, Miss Selfridge, Olympus, and Wallis, are busy
refurbishing their High Street stores with an eye on future growth.
However M&amp;S and Olympus are also making selective investments in
out-of-town retail parks, where there is more affordable space, to offer
a wider product range.
In the case of House of Fraser its refurbishment programme has
included substantial upgrading of its Frasers store in Glasgow in
addition to the first #4m phase of the four-year development plan to
establish Dickins &amp; Jones in London as a world-class department store.
This year the Edinburgh and Perth stores are among those earmarked for
upgrading.
Given that the heady growth in consumer spending seen in the 1980s
appears unlikely to return, no retailer, however large and well known,
can afford to sit back and become complacent. In the past, value for
money was taken to mean cheap prices, but these days it includes the
need to offer a pleasant shopping environment and good customer service.
Only those retailers who meet the increasing demands of customers will
prosper.
Although consumer confidence remains fragile, there is the prospect of
a recovery in domestic demand later in the year as money becomes more
available. There is the real prospect of tax cuts in the November budget
and early next year proceeds from the first Tax Exempt Special Savings
Schemes (Tessas) become available. Retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer who
offer real value for money in its widest sense can look forward to
increasing their share of an albeit difficult and highly competitive
market.

Giant-killer Andy Hicks is in danger
of receiving the chop himself after a poor start to his semi-final
with Derbyshire's Nigel Bond, who led 6-1 following yesterday's first
session.
The Tavistock left-hander, who has had stunning victories over Steve
Davis, Willie Thorne, and Peter Ebdon, had been quoted at 8-15 to win
the semi-final but is now rated 100-30. Bond has come in from 6-4
against to 5-1 on.
The match started encouragingly for the 21-year-old Devonian. Trailing
66-24 in the opening frame, he smashed in a long red to start a brave
clearance of 42 that forced a re-spotted black finish, and world No.33
Hicks sank the double black.
That would have dismayed many a player but world No.11 Bond levelled
with a yellow-to-pink clearance following a good snooker. He added
breaks of 61, 64, and 63 to lead 3-1 at the interval.
Hicks will be having nightmares about the one that got away in frame
five. He led 38-33 but missed an easy last red and Bond cleared up to
take the frame 59-38. Hicks led again in frame six 47-17 but Bond drove
in a long red to preface a frame-winning break of 54.
In the last frame of the afternoon, Bond was forging clear when 44-0
up. He potted another red -- but dropped the pink in to the middle
pocket at the same time.
Hicks came back and made 39 but missed the pink into the same pocket
to give Bond another lifeline.
The 29-year-old Bond needed no second invitation and he added a modest
run of 26 to take the frame 70-45.

ARABLE incomes are set for another substantial boost this year and one
which may well incur the wrath of the general public, according to a
leading grain trader.
Jim Aitken, who captained Scotland's Grand Slam rugby team back in
1984 and is now managing director of Edinburgh grain merchant Alexander
Inglis, said: ''Provided the weather is reasonable it's not just going
to be a good year for cereal growers it's going to be a huge one. The
whole thing has become a total nonsense and frankly if the public knew
what was going on they would be absolutely furious.''
Mr Aitken's comments referred to the fact that the entire arable
sector is in receipt of area payments intended to compensate for a
downwards movement of EU cereal prices to a true world level as well as
for taking land out of production through the set aside scheme.
Some of the individual payments last year were immense. Agriculture
Minister William Waldegrave revealed recently in the House of Commons
that in England and Wales no less than seven farm businesses were paid
in excess of #500,000 each, with a further 45 collecting between
#250,000 and #500,000. In Scotland the highest payment is believed to
have been just over #300,000. A substantial number received around
#100,000.
Grain prices throughout the world have been on the up during the past
12 months but the continuing frailty of sterling is putting cash into
the arable sector. The latest change on April 15 of 0.4% resulted in the
intervention price moving up to #114.48 per tonne and the non-LFA
payment to #103.88 per acre.
The spot market is at present very tight with prices ranging between
#118 and #120 for feed wheat. Mr Aitken believes this will not last.
''Come early July when French wheat hits the market we will be back to
around #100.''
Some farmers made costly errors last year by signing forward contracts
for their grain at under #90 per tonne. Few, he maintained, would repeat
the mistake, but his advice was: ''If you are offered #100 for feeding
grain at harvest take it.''
Prices for malting barley are also likely to be good this year, he
said. But his final warning was pointed: ''It won't last forever. There
is no way either the politicians or the public are going to see cash
shovelled out as it is being just now.''

THE first major production of the Redgrave season at Riverside
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the defeat of fascism, raises all
sorts of questions about the ambiguous notion of independence and
freedom. When the Macedonian capital of Skopje was liberated from the
Germans and occupying Bulgarians in 1945, what kind of freedom was it
they were liberated into? ''We have never known freedom,'' says one
character prophetically.
Dusan Jovanovic's sprawling, rough-hewn wartime epic creates some
quite exceptional moments of beauty and emotional eloquence, thanks not
only to Vanessa Redgrave's presence but also that of the powerful
Zagreb-born Rade Serbedezija, and young British actor Thomas Orange.
Orange plays Zoran, the precocious, enquiring young son of a Skopje
family struggling to stay alive under Nazi and Bulgarian occupation and
typifying the moral expediency required.
Jovanovic's 1977 drama shows there isn't much that's grand or heroic
under such circumstances: Serbedezija's Georgij's brain-damaged
resistance fighter (beaten up by the police) is a fiercely comic
portrait shorn of sentimentality, as is Redgrave's Lence, Zoran's aunt
-- a kind of Mother Courage figure -- valiantly trying to uphold
standards but willing to resort to anything, even making her sister
sleep with the local Nazi officer, if it will put food on their table.
Stylistically, Ljubisa Ristic's sand-and-rubble staging moves uneasily
between cinematic grandeur -- red banners, great blasts of synthesised
Balkan music, even a white stallion -- and scenes of aching simplicity
and naturalism. Within it, however, one can see all too vividly the
seeds of the present-day conflict in Bosnia, brought palpably to life by
the dedication of this wildly unwise but wonderful Anglo-Balkan
enterprise.

JUST a small disturbance in suburbia. Someone is making a nuisance of
himself out in the street. Drunk perhaps, though it's the middle of the
day.
He's working up a head of steam, this one, and it's hard, at first, to
make out what he's saying. That's not going to stop him. He's 50 feet
from the front door and he means to make certain everyone gets his
message.
Listen: ''I was God long before any of you bastards. I've been f***ing
God for years. I was God before you were even born!'' The members of the
Royal Edinburgh Hospital's Supreme Beings Club have fallen out again.
Plainly, feelings run high when you're arguing over whose turn it is to
be omnipotent this week. Demented, of course, the poor sod. You fall to
wondering who, or what, put the poison in his head.
But let's imagine for a second that he happens to be right. Why not?
The idea of God being returned to the community has a certain poetic
force.
Which persecution could be more apt in the late twentieth century? And
who says lunatics are always wrong? Besides, people believe worse
things. Some were clinging to the idea of David Koresh's divinity even
as the boys from the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms department were
barrelling through the walls of the Branch Davidian's redoubt. Others
insist that every word uttered by the Reverend Moon is molten truth.
Some just know it would please God if a man was put to death for writing
a book. Then there's the business of the chap on the cross. Take your
pick.
We live in irrational times. Those paid to worry about such things
suggest the millennium will set in train a carnival of cults, sects,
mystical obsessions, and new religions.
For some, the year 2000 has taken on a profound significance,
generally involving the end of the world or the dawning of a new age.
Christ or the anti-Christ is due, though there's some debate over which.
It's every saint for himself.
After the sarin atrocity in Tokyo last month, it is entirely possible
to believe this outbreak of mass hysteria has already begun. Group
suicides in Switzerland; 60 million Americans accepting the Bible's
literal truth; and murder in Oklahoma: has the world found a new way to
go nuts? Established churches are worried about the new religions, as
they should be. Mainstream religious organisations see congregations
ebbing away to charismatic sects, masochistic cults, proto-fascist
mystical groups, and home-brewed philosophies of enlightenment through
bean sprouts.
How can churches compete when, for example, one Californian cult
promises physical immortality for all (the clever part being that no-one
is ever in a position to ask for their money back)?
It is easy to mock the Age of Unreason, perhaps too easy. But after
centuries of intellectual effort the species still harbours hordes of
people happy to believe in crop circles, Satanism, horoscopes, UFOs, and
the Free Church of Scotland. While some of the tribe have made
astonishing strides in physics, mathematics, medicine, and hi-fi
technology, the rest are still banging the rocks together, wondering why
the smart arses haven't been smitten yet, and trying to think up new
reasons to burn people at the stake.
The serious point is that the tide of irrationality is rising. Much
the same phenomenon could be observed at the end of the last century,
when the occult became an international fad. The difference in 1995 is
not that some will believe strange things, but that many seem prepared
to believe just about anything.
Think back to our Christ in the suburbs. What, other than medical
opinion, disqualifies his claim? He meets all the criteria; he has
absolute faith in a central truth he just knows has been revealed to
him. It won't get him a bus pass, but it probably consoles him in the
small hours.
Why is his perfect faith any different in kind from that professed by
the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland? Revelation proved by the
Bible's truth, even when nothing about the Bible is proven, save that
many people believe it? As syllogisms go, it's a corker.
Cults vary only in their methods and claims. The central feature --
blind faith in revelation -- is always much the same. Worrying about
lunatic sects, we might do well to remember how the Quakers and the
Covenanters were once regarded. They got a lousy press too.
Mainstream religions, with their amazing claims and quirky practices,
are closer to the new age evangelists than they would care to admit, if
only because that might imply some responsibility. If you are not
scandalised by the thought, allow me to add that the only difference
between Christian churches and Aum Shinrikyo in Japan is that the
Vatican and its cousins forswore violence against unbelievers a while
back.
Our crazed god stalking Edinburgh feels his faith as strongly as any
minister, priest, rabbi, or mullah. Who's really nuts? I hear there's a
guy works down the chip shop swears he's Elvis.

* PRINCE Charles got a surprise gift when he visited the Prince and
Princess of Wales hospice in Glasgow last week. Ex-teacher and poet
Philomena Macdonald gave a copy of her book of poems, Song Unbroken, to
him. He was delighted.
Mrs Macdonald, who suffers from motor neurone disease, has been in the
hospice for a number of years, and she recently had her book reprinted
because of popular demand.
She raises money for the charity Hope -- which supports prisoners and
their families -- because she is ''a prisoner in her own body while they
are imprisoned in a cell''.
Copies of her book can be obtained from Hope at 18 Stevenson Street,
Glasgow, G40 2ST.
* ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, is now recognised as an illness.
But how to treat it remains a mystery.
If you suffer from it, or know someone who does, then make a note of a
special public meeting which will take place in Glasgow on Saturday, May
6.
Dr Charles Shepherd, medical advisor to the ME Association and author
of Living with ME will give a talk, ''ME and the Struggle for
Recognition'', followed by an open discussion.
Organised by the Glasgow ME Support Group, the meeting will start at
2.30pm in Pollokshaws Burgh Halls (opposite the entrance to Pollok Park
and the Burrell Collection).
Further information from the ME Association, 52 St Enoch's Square,
Glasgow, G1 4AA. Or ring the ME Helpline: 0141-204 3822.
* WANTED: 500 women runners to take part in the 5km Race for Life on
Sunday, July 2, through Glasgow Green.
It is organised by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, which is looking
for women to help raise money for research into women's cancers. They
are particularly anxious to encourage women who have had cancer to
either jog or walk in the event, because they believe it will encourage
and support women currently being treated for the disease.
Two television presenters, Jackie Bird (BBC) and Shereen Nanjiani
(Scottish Television) have already signed up, along with 83-year-old
Scots marathon runner, Jenny Wood Allen.
For an exercise programme to get fit for the big day, contact Race for
Life Hotline on 0171-269 3413.
* EXTRA iron in pregnancy may be unnecessary. Research carried out at
Chelsea and Westminster hospitals, London, analysed more than 150,000
pregnancies and found that the recommended World Health Organ-isation
threshold for iron supplements is too high.
* THE extent to which doctors are increasingly under stress is shown
by the calls made to the confidential National Counselling Service for
Sick Doctors. In a six-month survey, twice as many GPs as hospital
doctors were in touch, blaming their illness on dependence on alcohol,
drugs, or both.
Dr Gerard McGlone, a GP in Glasgow, says in Scottish Medicine that
many doctors, despite the stress and strain, deny that they are ill or
unable to cope, and he claims that the need for the counselling service
is greater than ever.
* MOST elderly people prefer to stay for as long as possible in their
own home but they often need extra care and assistance. Obtaining that
help is often difficult. Now Counsel &amp; Care, the advice service for the
elderly, has produced a booklet outlining help available.
It includes details of benefits and financial assistance, also the
main sources of care provision at home using statutory, voluntary, and
private services. Copies available free of charge. Write, enclosing a
stamped, self-addressed envelope (size 9x6), to Counsel &amp; Care, Twyman
House, 16 Bonny Street, London, NW1 9PG.
* COUNTING the number of moles on your chest may indicate your risk of
skin cancer. Those with seven or more moles measuring more than two
millimetres or more were found to be more likely to develop skin cancer,
says a recent report in the British Medical Journal. Other risk factors
are fair or red hair, freckles, severe reaction to sun, and regular
sunbathing holidays.
A new leaflet telling people how to protect themselves from the sun is
available from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Send an sae to: Save
Your Skin, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, PO Box 123, Lincoln's Inn
Fields, London, WC2A 3PX.
* HAY fever patients are being urged to see their doctors well in
advance of the pollen season by the British Allergy Foundation. The
Foundation says: ''Steroid sprays taken before symptoms start can
prevent inflammation taking hold.''

Eric Kennedy visits two newly-opened units for patients in North
Ayrshire which cater for accident and emergency cases and expectant
mothers
HEALTH-care for the twenty-first century has taken a double step
forward recently in the area covered by the North Ayrshire and Arran NHS
Trust.
A total investment of nearly #2m means that accident and emergency
patients in North Ayrshire have the benefit of an upgraded and extended
A and E unit at Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, while a new midwifery
suite at Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine is setting new standards in
care for mothers from the whole of Ayrshire.
At Crosshouse, just under #1m has been spent on the accident and
emergency extension and upgrade, which was declared open by Kilmarnock
and Louden MP William McKelvey on March 31.
It means that road victims from the A77, people rescued from the sea
or mountains, heart-attack sufferers, and victims of drugs-related or
violent incidents can at least have the comfort of modern facilities and
significantly increased medical support.
Crosshouse already has a proud record in this field with a recent
survey placing it top of the league in Scotland for brevity of patient
waiting time.
Now the service is even better, with patients assessed quickly by
dedicated nursing assessment staff, taken to a new resuscitation room as
required, and supervised by the latest electronic monitoring equipment.
''The inbuilt overhead X-ray equipment in the resuscitation room cost
nearly #300,000,'' says Mr James Stevenson, consultant accident and
emergency surgeon at the unit.
''A patient is taken there if he or she is showing signs of severe
distress, illness, or injury: otherwise he will be taken to the
immediate-treatment room adjacent, when sophisticated monitoring
equipment will alert staff to any change in condition.''
A digitalised screen indicates the probable waiting time to patients.
Often it is 0.00, although night-time tends to be rather busier.
The upgrade represents the biggest single investment in the department
since Crosshouse Hospital opened in 1982. Its resuscitation room is one
of the most advanced in Scotland, and the department now has a fully
equipped intermediate care area, refurbished reception and patient
waiting area, new training facilities, and a new treatment room
especially for children.
Accident and emergency cases at Crosshouse have increased from about
12,000 in 1983 to nearly 47,000 last year, due partly to a greater
willingness by the public to approach a hospital these days, to a
greater tendency by GPs to refer patients.
Crosshouse also handles sea-rescue and mountain-rescue patients, with
a new heli-pad opened last year to provide all-weather and
round-the-clock landing facilities.
Having a baby may never be the same again for some Ayrshire women now
that the midwifery suite is up and running at Ayrshire Central Hospital.
This #800,000 facility at Irvine is dedicated to helping mothers
choose how her labour and delivery are to be managed. As the first
purpose-built unit of its type in Scotland, it is an eye-opener: the
four delivery rooms look more like bedrooms, with vanity units,
divan-type beds, TVs, soft furnishings, and matching curtains and quilt
covers.
All of this is, however, the icing on the cake. The real beauty of the
unit, says Mrs Kate Docherty, clinical services manager and link
supervisor of midwives, is that traditional midwifery care is available
all the way through, with emphasis on women's choice and involvement.
Those who want a natural labour and birth, with little or no
intervention, are supported in their choice unless there is some medical
or obstetric consideration that might prevent it.
Once in the unit, she can take a warm bath to help ease labour pains,
and can have access to a submersion pool -- a deep, oval pool,
thermostatically controlled and designed to help relaxation during
labour. It is deep enough to support the mother's body weight and large
enough to allow freedom of movement.
The unit was opened only on March 24 by Mrs Ian Lang, wife of the
Scottish Secretary, and already, says Mrs Docherty, there appears to be
a drop in the use of pain-relief injections. Having said that, a mother
can have gas and air or injections as the labour progresses, and even an
epidural, though this would mean transfer to the main obstetric unit.
In addition to the midwifery suite development, the existing delivery
suite has been extended to include two delivery rooms large enough to
accommodate the personnel and equipment necessary to attend a multiple
birth.
''I think the benefits of the midwifery suite are threefold,'' says
Mrs Docherty.
''It is a facility for women who wish a labour and delivery with no
intervention, and in a homely and comfortable environment; it allows
midwives the opportunity to fully use their skills and free medical
staff to concentrate on those women who require their expertise; and it
provides an environment conducive to learning, exposing students to
normal midwifery practices.''

A JOINT venture between the Castle Douglas market firm of Wallets
Marts and Harrison &amp; Hetherington has moved closer following three hours
of talks between the two companies.
A letter to the 360 shareholders of Wallets, one of the oldest market
businesses in the South of Scotland, is expected to be sent out within
the next few days recommending rejection of a #1m takeover bid by
Ayr-based James Craig. The #8.50 a share offer made at the weekend,
putting the value of the company at just over #1m, invited shareholders
to respond by May 12.
Tom Gillespie, chairman of Wallets' board of directors, said he hoped
it would soon be in a position to put forward a recommendation to
shareholders for the venture with the Cumbrian firm, Harrison &amp;
Hetherington, which has a turnover of almost #200m -- around 10 times
that of Wallets.
James Craig said the Castle Douglas market was an important part of
the local community and if the venture was successful it would expand
the cattle trade and maintain the Galloway sales for which Wallets is
world famous.
Mr Gillespie and his board and advisers met the H&amp;H delegation at
Castle Douglas. It was led by Robbie Weir of Townfoot, the chairman of
the board, and managing director David Tomlinson. Afterwards Mr
Gillespie said he did not foresee any meeting with James Craig.
He added that there had been no move by the board to support the bid
and it expected to have further meetings with H&amp;H. He added that there
did not appear to be support from shareholders.
''We have already told shareholders in a letter not to take any action
over the offer from Craigs. We will be issuing a further letter giving
more details on this, and then we will be sending out a letter on our
talks with the Carlisle firm on the joint operation.
''This will be the favoured option for the long-term future of Castle
Douglas from the point of view of the company, the community and
staff.'' Mr Gillespie went on to say that the final decision would rest
with the shareholders.
In recent times Wallets, renowned as a strong firm financially with
minimal borrowings, has been working with H&amp;H -- which has premises and
markets at Lockerbie, Dumfries and Newcastleton as well as in Cumbria.
Wallets currently employs 15 people as well as a number of casual
workers and showed a profit of #121,000 last year.

CAROLE WODDIS reports on a new bid to recreate the magic of the Al
Jolson experience.
HE hailed himself as ''the World's Greatest Entertainer''. He invented
the phrase ''you ain't heard nothing yet'' (hijacked by another great
communicator, Ronald Reagan, as ''you ain't seen nothing yet'') and in
1927 he saved Warner Brothers from bankruptcy with his appearance in The
Jazz Singer, the first recognisable talkie.
There was, it seems, nothing quite like the Al Jolson ego (the
catchphrase was Jolson's response to following Caruso, on the same bill,
who had just sung his heart out with Pagliacci). Becoming a legend in
his own lifetime, he stirred the hearts of a generation with songs such
as Swanee River, Mammy, April Showers, and California Here I Come.
In his time Jolson was the first man to make $10,000 on Broadway and
in 1932 was earning $17,500 a week -- the highest-paid entertainer in
America. By the end of the decade, however, his career was already in
nose-dive, although with The Jolson Story in 1946, for which he supplied
the singing voice to ''straight'' actor Larry Parks, he made a
triumphant if shortlived comeback.
By all accounts the Jolson magic lay in his talent as a performer. He
just loved to perform. He loved audiences. ''The moment the curtain came
down, he died,'' noted another great singer of the time, Eddie Cantor.
Cantor also had to admit ''there was something electric about him that
sent a thrill up your spine. He sang and talked but he was more than
just a singer or an actor -- he was an experience.''
Now that experience is about to be recreated in a new musical based on
his life, Jolson, opening in London in October after an eight-week
out-of-town tour starting in Plymouth. Presented by the same team --
producer Paul Elliott, director Rob Bettinson and music director Paul
Jury -- behind the musical blockbuster Buddy (about Buddy Holly and
still going strong after six years) and starring Brian Conley of ITV's
Time After Time, they would seem to have another showbiz juggernaut on
their hands.
At least that's the way they see it, and with #500,000 in advance box
office, who's to deny them. Adapted by Francis Essex from the book of
Jolson's life by Michael Freedland, the #2m, 40-cast show will, in the
words of the producers, give audiences ''two and a half hours of talent
and ego''.
''We're not out to do a documentary,'' explained director Bettinson.
''It's going to be massive -- like Ben Hur with music. We're going to
give audiences the Jolson experience again.''
But who still remembers Jolson? And haven't fashion and social fads
changed too much? In these days of political correctness can we still
take someone ''blacking up''? Last year's bio-play about Sid Field, even
with the brilliant David Suchet on board, was an object lesson in the
susceptibility of humour to changing tastes.
Producers Elliott and Laurie Mansfield reckon they have a trump card
up their sleeve in Brian Conley who, judging by the two-minute trailer
at the Savoy-hosted launch, not only looks and sounds the part but has
charisma shining out of every pore. Perhaps the gods are still on
Jolson's side.

The 7:84 Theatre Company production Born Guilty , which opens at the
Citizens' Theatre tonight, has benefited from the
input of German dramatistRainer Lau. This is his account of working in
Scotland
Sins of the Fatherland
THE invitation from Glasgow, which I received in the autumn of 1994
was surprising enough: 7:84 Theatre Company were looking for a
dramaturge for their production of Born Guilty in spring 1995.
Although the company knew of my limited English skills from our
previous collaboration on the New Frontiers project, and director Iain
Reekie had talked to other German directors/dramaturges, they decided to
ask me again. This was something to celebrate, but it also imposed an
obligation. The books Strangers In Their Own Land, Born Guilty, and
Incurably German deal with a period in German history which few, if any,
of my compatriots would happily approach without inhibitions.
On the other hand, this was also an opportunity for me to find out
exactly what people from another country thought about our Nazi past.
(It is perfectly possible to have been friends with someone for 10years
or more and still, during all this time, have happily given a wide berth
to an unhappy subject.)
The work on New Frontiers had coincided with the wave of violence of
German neo-Nazis: the names of Rostock and Molln and the associated
images went around the world. We, as Germans, were being asked to
explain ourselves.
The ''enigma'' of the Holocaust -- the starting point of Born Guilty
-- calls out for explanation over and over again. Since Germans
themselves find it difficult enough to come up with plausible arguments
explaining the extermination of the Jews, it came as no surprise to find
the opinion expressed here that Germany's degeneration into a state that
perpetrated mass murder on an industrial scale, was a fate that could
happen to any nation on earth if it found itself in a similar situation.
The fact that other nations have not piled up such huge mountains of
corpses when they experienced a situation of crisis, says everything or
nothing really.
Although Born Guilty deals with the children, and sometimes even the
grandchildren, of the victims and perpetrators, almost all the questions
I faced here were about the final solution. My theatrical colleagues
were unaware that the final solution was the final seal of the era of
German National Socialism.
Many hours of our preparation time flew by before we were able to
reach agreement: it is impossible to understand why the Germans went so
enthusiastically into the war under the Nazis and murdered the Jews,
apparently without any scruples, if one has not first understood how,
and why, the majority of Germans marched so enthusiastically into
National Socialism.
But it is also impossible to expect the Scottish education system to
cover 150 years of German history in detail, never mind the chapter
which even our chancellor, Helmut Kohl, evades with his meaningless and
obfuscatory phrase ''the grace of being born after''!
It was a surprising result of our time-consuming excursions into
history that afterwards the question in the title -- whether it is
possible to be ''born guilty'' -- played no serious role at all.
National Socialism did not overtake the German people as an inexplicable
black fate. Sufficient contemporary documents have been amassed that
prove the majority of Germans knew, or at least guessed, what was
happening in their country.
To those of us who accept that the path of their nation was the result
of the conscious decisions of those alive at the time, the question of
whether it is possible to be ''born guilty'' makes no sense. These
people will then demand to know what actually happened during this
period and, armed with this knowledge, they can decide differently
today.
Every unanswered question or evasive answer to this catastrophe gives
sustenance to the tendency in the descendants to see themselves as
innocent victims or as ''born guilty''. Only those without knowledge can
be seduced into repetition; some nations (and people) are condemned to
repeat their mistakes and catastrophes over and over until they
recognise themselves in them.
I was originally asked to write a piece for The Herald about
differences between the Scottish and German theatre systems. If I
haven't said anything about this so far it is because I consider it more
important to describe how we have tried to reach a common understanding
of a chapter of European history -- namely German-British enmity -- than
to enumerate our differences.
Anyway, there is really only one big difference, from which all other
differences then follow: the money!For more than 100 years, all the big
German theatre companies have been in the fortunate position of
receiving the funds they require to cover their expenditures, and for
the upkeep of a permanent home from municipal government, from the state
government or from the federal government.
The amount of money that theatres receive each year also pays for the
salaries of all the artists and other people working in the theatre, and
in such a way that they can all work together throughout the year
permanently, at one theatre.
Actors' contracts usually run for two years or longer, while the
contracts of the other staff are usually unlimited. Small theatres have
from 100-200 staff, while large ones can have up to 1000. There are more
than 100 theatres like this in the German-speaking area, including
Austria and Switzerland.
In the whole of the British Isles there can hardly be more than 10
theatres that can boast such good material conditions -- as far as I
know there are only two theatres working with permanent ensembles.
This, then, is the heart of the German theatre: a repertory programme
(very large theatres can perform 20 to 30 different plays) and an
ensemble company -- the actors, almost without exception, perform in
several plays and they are on stage almost every day, usually playing
something different daily.
If German theatre is more artistically challenging and also more
demanding than those few productions I have seen here up until now, then
this is not because German theatre artists are ''better trained''. It is
because we have many, many more permanent theatres that demand
excellence from their artists, and German actors have far more routine
in the practice of their profession.
Only those who work regularly at a high level and are challenged, can
deliver very good performances over the long term. No German actor -- if
he has a contract with a theatre -- needs to work in an office during
the day or drive a taxi in order to be able to act in the theatre at
night.
The German theatre system is a unique cultural phenomenon, just like
the traditions of other countries. Outside Germany it is meaningless to
have expectations based on our system -- and, incidentally, the voices
of those who would gladly have the British theatre system in order to
save money are becoming louder in Germany -- but for Scottish theatre I
would wish for some permanent theatres, with an ensemble for several
years and a repertoire. I would wish it for the public, and above all I
would wish it for my Scottish colleagues.

FINNISH conductor Osmo Banska clearly set out to signal this was to be
no mere run through the two war horses of the orchestral repertoire that
formed the outer parts of this BBC SSO Studio One concert. Beethoven's
Leonore No 2 and Dvorak's New World Symphony were both given highly
personal readings, and further to underscore his individualism, an
unfamiliar piece by fellow Finn Joonas Kokkonen was spliced between the
two.
Highly accented contrasts between tempi appeared to be the motto for
the evening. The Leonore overture got an ever so long wind-up, with
mannered rests before that initial burst of sunlight. All very
effective, even if things grew a little less structured thereafter until
the arrival of the offstage trumpet call when shape and forward
progression returned.
The following Interludes from the Opera by Kokkonen came over as
lively listening. In four sections played without a break, the first
three were rich in colourful orchestration with a distinctive woodwind
and percussion signature to it, the final Andante providing a resolution
to the preceding dramatic conflicts in the writing.
On to Dvorak's Symphony No 9 and a first movement that was fairly
whisked through at a cracking pace. The second movement, with its famous
tune, elicited some brilliant horn playing in the face of, at one point,
the conductor's near stalling tempo. Here as elsewhere in the evening
the orchestra were brilliantly responsive to every gesture from the
podium, culminating in an explosively charged final movement.

IT'S not hard to see why Hollywood is having so much difficulty in
finding an Eva Peron for the film version of the 17-year-old Tim Rice
and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. The lead role has to establish herself
with very little in the way of actual material in the book -- sheer
charisma is what is required to make the part work. Which is where,
unfortunately, this touring production fails to engage.
It's not that Marti Webb is bad, it's just that she's not quite good
enough. Her slightly peculiar diction even contrives to make something
of an oddity of the show-stopper Don't Cry For Me Argentina, which is
crucial because Rice's lyrics are what makes the song. If it had been,
say, I'll Love You Today and Forever, the tune would not have become the
modern classic it is.
Just the same, the score does contradict all the Lloyd Webber critics,
with that song's obverse Oh What A Circus, Another Suitcase In Another
Hall, and I'll Be Surprisingly Good For You making it more than a
one-song show. Sure, there's some inferior music, but it is all
thoroughly composed, even within the limitations of a confined
plot-line.
The choreography of this production, directed by Ken Urmston after
Harold Prince, is also deliberately confined within a set that restricts
the expanse of the Playhouse stage, and very good it is too. Even if the
military do look alarmingly like the Village People.
But the adoration of the public for this Evita is still inexplicable.
When Spain falls for her charms, Che (Christopher Corcoran) reports her
description as ''the New World Madonna''. Now there's a good notion for
Hollywood.

Women face an uphill struggle to achieve equality with men in a tight
Labour market. Joan McFadden reports on a unique hands-on initiative
which aims to widen vistas for adolescent girls as they consider their
future choice of careers
TAKE Our Daughters to Work Day takes place today, and hopes to build
on the successful start it had last year. Established by Our Daughters
Charitable Trust, which aims to promote the equality of women with men
through public education, it is the type of event which gives rise to a
variety of reactions.
The necessity of raising women's profile in the workplace cannot be
ignored, especially in light of the latest statistics. More than half
the population is female, yet women make up only 40% of the workforce
and, on average, earn nearly 25% less than men. The statistics on
management level throughout the country are even more discouraging, with
only 4% of positions held by women.
Working at home as the primary carer of children, and sometimes
elderly or disabled relatives, puts women even further down the career
ladder. This type of work is usually unpaid, and any carer's allowance
is meagre in comparison to the efforts involved. Women's work of any
kind is relevant, and as such, Take our Daughters to Work Day is
important.
It does, however, beg the question of whether it is merely tokenism,
or the first step towards both recognition of the value of carers and
acceptance to women in traditionally male-dominated areas.
All change has to have a beginning, no matter how small. There are so
many days and weeks in celebration of various causes that there is a
temptation to consider them facile, irrespective of the message they are
attempting to communicate.
There are two main criticisms levelled at this initiative and the
first, strangely enough, is the date chosen. Bearing in mind that the
age group targeted is 11 to 15-year-olds, the upper age levels in
Scotland are immersed in exam preparation at this time, and have limited
time to invest in other schemes.
Secondly, it is likely that many of the girls taking part would be
heading educationally in the required direction anyway, so this type of
encouragement would be redundant.
The trust acknowledges that there is bound to be some criticism,
especially in the early days before it is firmly established as an
intrinsic of education and enterprise, but points to the organisation
involved to illustrate its commitment.
It is an enormous project, and in setting up the initiative, forward
planning took account of factors such as beneficial publicity for
employers and an information package for schools which have pupils
wishing to participate.
The first step was in targeting companies direct and asking them to
become involved in the scheme. The obvious starting point here was
business giants, and public services with excellent communication
networks.
Companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, the Royal Mail and Sainsbury gave
immediate support last year, as did many city councils, and intend to do
so again this year, while strong local support is the next aim.
Scottish input has been given greater consideration on two fronts: the
project is being supported by the Scottish Education Business
Partnership network, and public relations are being dealt with locally.
The trust hopes for a clearer perspective on singularly Scottish
needs, and after the event itself, an assessment of local involvement to
utilise further planning.
There can be no argument about the value of the aims bound up in Take
Our Daughters to Work, and not just in traditional career terms. All the
information provided on the scheme stresses the importance of having a
family and running a home, while emphasising that there are other
choices.
Giving women credibility is vital to the success of this event, and
that should be reflected in every area of their lives.
It is not all intense and serious theorising. Today should be fun for
all involved -- entertaining and instructive for students and beneficial
to employers for assessing their future workforce.
Organisations, recognising that all work should be universally
acceptable to both sexes, will benefit most in the future, as this
becomes less innovative and more the norm.
Some people are looking even further ahead. When Edinburgh District
Council decided to support Take Our Daughters to Work, they extended the
idea in all seriousness to include Take Our Sons to Work Day, which is
currently being organised.
Advancing the education of both girls and boys about the employment
opportunities available to them would eventually make events like this
unnecessary, but for the moment, they are a small beginning which should
be welcomed.

TONY BLAIR and his supporters say they want to turn Labour into a
''modern'' party so that it can take office in Britain. On the face of
it, this seems reasonable to some punters. But the role model is Bill
Clinton. This explains why Blair's advisers have been visiting the USA
for election tips and gimmicks.
If an exchange of ideas can be useful, it is more important to
remember that Clinton's party -- the Democrats -- is a big-business
outfit which pays little attention to the needs of America's poor whites
let alone poor blacks, who are increasingly involved in struggles
against slum landlords and skinflint employers.
Mr Blair is in the same mould. He sends his son to a privileged school
then attacks school-teachers who are fighting back against lower
standards. He denounces low wages, but refuses to be committed to a
figure for a guaranteed minimum wage.
He is critical of privatisation, yet he does not favour public
ownership, not even de-privatisation.
However, the real eye-opener is the people around him -- MPs who once
claimed to be committed to CND and the working class but who now are
going around the boardrooms assuring bosses that Labour poses no threat
to their activities.
To prove their credentials, they have hijacked the party, making it
clear that the present Clause 4 will be removed from its constitution.
In effect, Blair's regime is carrying on where the SDP infiltrators
left off some years ago by suggesting that to defeat the Conservatives
at their own game Labour must turn itself into another version of the
Tory Party.

Kiev, Wednesday
THOUSANDS of dead and dying were mourned in Ukraine today nine years
after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.
Officials used the occasion to challenge the West to pay for the
stricken complex to be finally closed down.
Young women in white gowns carried candles through Slavutych, the town
where most of Chernobyl's 5800 staff live today, to honour the so-called
''liquidators'' who died after fighting the explosion and fire in the
plant's fourth reactor on April 26 1986.
Figures this week showed that 5722 of the 200,000 liquidators have
since died.
Weeping crowds in the town 60 miles north of Kiev converged on a stone
memorial bearing photographs of victims at 1.26am -- the moment when the
accident occurred after an unauthorised experiment went terrifyingly
wrong.
Meanwhile, Ukraine's parliament urged the West to remember the
unprecedented scale of the disaster -- 3.7 million people affected by
radiation, more than 160,000 resettled and huge stretches of territory
too contaminated for habitation.
''Chernobyl represents a real threat to other countries, above all
because of the extraordinarily difficult scientific and technical
problems which Ukraine cannot solve on its own,'' an official statement
said.
Western governments have said Chernobyl is unsafe and Ukrainian
authorities this month bowed to pressure and agreed to close its two
working reactors by the year 2000. But ministers say the West should
help provide the #2.6 billion needed to close Chernobyl and build a new
thermal plant.
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said during a visit to Prague that
he is worried about cracks in the ''tomb'' enclosing the fourth reactor
which was hurriedly built by volunteers.
In Belarus, which suffered 70% of the contamination from the blast,
officials said two million of its 10 million population had suffered
from after effects.
More than 10% of Belarus' national budget is still spent on clean-up
operations after nine years of work, as is 6% in Ukraine.
* The German parliament decided to launch a full inquiry into nuclear
smuggling from the former Soviet Union today amid charges that Bonn's
intelligence service set up a spectacular atomic haul last year.
This came one day after Bavarian officials admitted letting a
Lufthansa plane carry contraband plutonium from Moscow to Munich because
they could not trust Russian security officials to intercept it before
take-off.

IT is bizarre of your leader-writer to claim that terrorism takes the
world ''one more step down the road to anarchy'' (April 21).
True anarchy -- the absence of rulers, democracy in its purest form --
is a noble ideal which events like the Oklahoma City bombing do nothing
to promote.
In fact the reverse is often the case: by lending credence to the
alarmist claims of those whose pockets stand to be lined by the growing
''security'' industry (in the form of more surveillance cameras, better
police weaponry, identity cards, etc) such acts of terror only play into
the hands of the state and its capitalist allies.
It is not anarchy to which terrorist action brings us closer but
totalitarianism.

LABOUR MP Brian Wilson really is whistling in the dark if he seriously
believes his party has the proverbial snowball's chance of defeating the
Tories in the forthcoming Perth and Kinross by-election.
Contrary to his speculative fantasies (April 21) the only opposition
party which has a genuine chance of achieving this objective is the SNP,
which, in the recent local elections, took control of the new Perthshire
and Kinross council, winning 18 out of 32 seats as well as 41% of the
popular vote.
And, although the Conservatives only managed to win two seats on the
new council, they were in fact grossly under-represented due to the
unfairness of the electoral system and secured 24% of the popular vote,
making them the second most popular party in the new unitary council
area.
In contrast, Labour could only muster a 14.35% share of the vote,
while admittedly winning six seats. This performance was only marginally
ahead of that of the Liberal Democrats whose share of the votes was 13%
and who won five seats.
And while it would be tempting fate to forecast the result of the
by-election especially as its date has not yet been officially
announced, any detached analysis could scarcely fail to confirm that the
SNP does seem to be on course to take the seat from the Tories, with the
other two parties fighting each other for third place.

THE Cairngorms is the one of the most precious swathes of wilderness
in Britain -- indeed in Europe -- and much of the best of it is covered
by Mar Lodge estate. Mar Lodge is unique. In any enlightened view these
120 square miles of mountain and glen, river and ancient forest, habitat
of rare birds and plants, would be priceless. But in the practical world
even empty space has a market value and the National Trust for Scotland
may be satisfied that the #5m purchase price is a bargain. Not so long
ago double that sum was being asked. Lottery money, the support of the
mysterious Easter Trust (whose membership and interest we should now
know), and lobbying by activists have combined to secure a national
asset. In theory it might have been better if ownership had passed to
the conservation group whose joint bid failed three years ago, partly
through Government indifference. Best of all might have been a Mar Lodge
national park, but the idea of new national parks is taboo in the
present political climate.
Since the nation declines to invest outright in its grandest scenic
riches it is fortunate that a disinterested body like the National Trust
for Scotland is prepared to take over stewardship in the name of the
people. At least some of the upkeep will be met by an endowment fund.
Conservation is to have priority. Total freedom of access is promised.
The excessive number of red deer will be reduced. The old forest will be
encouraged to grow again.
But there are some important reservations. The outgoing owner, the
American millionaire John Kluge, has imposed a condition that stag
shooting shall continue on his former fief. This is an ominous
volte-face by the trust, which until now has rigorously banned stalking
for sport from its land. There is no deer hunting in Glen Coe, where
walkers and climbers are free to roam throughout the year without fear
of incurring the wrath of landowners. Some other proposals may cause
alarm bells to ring, particularly as they relate to promoting tourism.
The lodge itself, recently renovated after a disastrous fire, is to be
turned into accommodation for wealthy sporting visitors. This may be
merely an extension of what happened before: for house guests read
paying guests. There is talk of a visitor centre and improved footpaths.
But conservationists have repeatedly argued against making access to
wilderness easy on the grounds that it would destroy the very features
we strive to save. The unique importance of this area on a world-wide
scale is its remoteness, its wildness, its isolation. Mar Lodge can
never become just another stop on the heritage trail.

IF Rupert Murdoch were a bacillus there would be Government-backed
research in an attempt to find a cure. Instead we have the unedifying
sight of a Government in supine position as Mr Murdoch prepares to
invade yet another national body, that of terrestrial television. Mr
Murdoch is not, of course, a bacillus. We feel this should be mentioned
in case he is feeling litigious. Nevertheless, the effect of his various
activities in and around the area of provision of information and
entertainment to the citizens of Britain does constitute an attempt at
an unwarrantable invasion and domination of an area which is of
considerable importance to the nation. Specifically, and at the moment,
this refers to his attempt to secure a stake in the forthcoming Channel
5 television licence. Bids for this new channel, which will reach
approximately 70% of the British population, are due next week. Given
the extraordinary international economic power of Mr Murdoch it seems
only too likely that the group in which he has a minority stake will
succeed in winning a competition which has only minimal strictures on
standards and a clear leaning towards the financially robust. In this
sort of contest Mr Murdoch is eminently suited for victory. The question
which must be addressed is whether the acquisition of further media
power by Mr Murdoch will aid the cause of open democracy and the
provision of plurality of opinion in Britain.
It will not. This much is clear from his existing ownership of BSkyB
and 36% of the British press. There is nothing new about media barons in
this country, but the scale of ownership and power which Mr Murdoch
wields through his media acquisitions is already of a scale to cause
real concern. In this context it would, perhaps, be wise to re-state our
own position. We are an independent newspaper, owing allegiance to no
party and determined to stay that way. The fact that we are popularly
supposed, by their opponents, to adhere to the Tories, Labour, Liberal
Democrats, Scottish Nationalists, Greens, and Martian Independence
Party, is a source of comfort. No such confusion exists over the
partiality of the editorial stance of Mr Murdoch's products. Nor is this
simply a domestic matter, for the international spread of his holdings
ensures that any national acquisition will be fed the same basic diet as
every other media entity which he owns. A diverse supply and range of
national programmes will be threatened and local producers will be
excluded. The evidence of Mr Murdoch's existing businesses suggests that
the dumping of cheap and deeply unchallenging American programmes will
continue; his ownership of film libraries will ensure the continuation
of the imposition of a culture from another land and another time. We
used to laugh at the French and their protestations over cultural
imperialism from abroad: no more.
There is, it must be admitted, an element of whingeing in the
protestations of British media leaders in all this. Nevertheless, Mr
Michael Grade and other enterprising British producers are faced with
economic forces which can overwhelm them with scant effort. The core of
the problem lies in the attitude of politicians to the whole issue of
media ownership. The Government has no policy on broadcasting issues and
ownership other than dither. The regulatory rules of the Broadcasting
Act of 1990 are in the process of review, but the bidding for Channel 5
will start without the review being completed. The National Heritage
Secretary, Mr Stephen Dorrell is relaxed on the subject; unfortunately
his relaxation is of the sort which leads to regulatory atrophy. Indeed,
Mr Dorrell added to the anxiety yesterday by appearing to suggest that
current regulation is regarded by many as too tough. He is either
deluded or mischievous. Nor is there comfort to be found in the Labour
camp. Labour murmurs deprecatingly about the whole affair, but the
Labour Party has no published policy on the issue. As ever, Walworth
Road waits for the Tories to stumble; no leading from the front there.
In summation, the bidding for Channel 5 must be stopped until the review
of regulations is complete. If the regulations are not sufficiently
stringent in their preservation of diversity and democratic plurality of
opinion, they must be reviewed again.

The Hague, Wednesday
BOSNIAN Serb Dusan Tadic, the first suspect to appear before the UN's
Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal, today denied murdering, raping and
torturing Croats and Muslims during a campaign of ethnic cleansing in
Bosnia in 1992.
Tadic, a 39-year-old former cafe proprietor, entered his not guilty
plea in Serbo-Croat at a 25-minute preliminary hearing in a
specially-built courtroom in The Hague at the first international war
crimes tribunal since the Tokyo and Nuremberg trials of the 1940s.
Sitting impassively in the dock, Tadic, wearing a dark leather jacket
and yellow polo-necked shirt, stood briefly to give his name and another
forename that he has used.
Asked by presiding judge Gabrielle McDonald, from the United States,
if Tadic had seen the UN indictment, his defence lawyer Michail
Wladimiroff said that he had and waived the formal reading of the
charges.
After some minutes of confusion during which Tadic was unable to hear
the Serbian translation of the judge's comments through his headphones,
Tadic entered a plea of ''not guilty'', adding: ''I did not participate
in any of these deeds.''
The indictment against Tadic for war crimes and crimes against
humanity accuses him of taking part in the murder of 13 victims,
including four who died in the notorious Omarska concentration camp.
It also accuses him of beating and maltreating 16 victims, raping a
woman identified only as ''F'' at Omarska and maltreating other
unidentified victims.
In one incident he is charged with forcing a man to bite off a
testicle of another prisoner who later died of his injuries.
Images of emaciated prisoners behind barbed wire fences at Omarska
caused an international outcry in the summer of 1992.
Flanked by two armed guards, Tadic was escorted into a cage of
bullet-proof glass to appear before three tribunal judges. He looked
composed throughout the short preliminary hearing.
Prosecution documents show Tadic was transformed by an orgy of ethnic
cleansing from a rural cafe owner who got on well with his Muslim
neighbours into a ruthless and sadistic killer.
Tadic's appearance followed Monday's naming by tribunal prosecutor
Richard Goldstone of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and two of his
military aides as war crimes suspects.
That move clearly signalled the tribunal's intent to step up its
investigations and pursue those who orchestrated campaigns of genocide,
while also charging those who carried out the alleged atrocities in the
three-year old Bosnian war.
The tribunal has so far indicted 22 Serbs, all of whom except Tadic
are believed to be at large in Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia or Serbia
itself.
Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs have refused to hand over suspects to the
tribunal. But the panel has said it will issue international arrest
warrants against suspects who fail to appear for trial, exposing them as
fugitives from justice.
Tadic has been held in Scheveningen jail since German authorities
handed him over on Monday. He was arrested in Munich in February 1994
after being recognised by former victims who fled Bosnia.
Judge McDonald said the court could not yet set a date for Tadic's
trial. This will depend on private negotiations between the prosecution
and defence lawyers which are likely to take at least six weeks.
The Hague tribunal was set up by the Security Council in May 1993. It
can jail convicted war criminals but it cannot impose the death penalty
and it cannot try suspects in absentia.
* A fresh increase in fighting across Bosnia was reported by the UN
today amid signs Western countries are growing increasingly disenchanted
with the peacekeeping mission.
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur warned again today that France
will consider withdrawing all its 4500 troops from Bosnia if there is no
extension of the current truce and greater protection provided for
peacekeepers.
Russia, which has some 1130 UN troops in the former Yugoslavia, issued
a similar warning.--Reuter.

THERE were two letters (April 7) making comment about the UK
construction industry and the iniquitous conditions under which
sub-contractors are forced to work without a single reference to the
review carried out by Sir Michael Latham and the recommendations for
changes to the industry made in his report, Constructing the Team,
published in July 1994.
The Latham Report, amongst other things, recognises the unfair
practices and difficulties suffered by sub-contractors and sets out a
package of measures aimed at solving most of them.
The report also recommends that incremental payments are almost
guaranteed by the client proving ability to pay, the contract ensuring
that payment is made to contractor and sub-contractor, and by the
availability of immediate contractual redress should payment be delayed.
Should dispute arise, Latham recommends swift justice through a
standard contract adjudication system rather than being dealt with
through a protracted and expensive arbitration or court proceeding.
The Latham Report says much more and your correspondents would more
effectively spend their time by promoting the implementation of the
report's 30 recommendations then regurgitating old arguments and
outdated proposals. It is April 1995, after all.

SALMON and sea-trout have returned to the River Clyde and its
attendant streams, including the River Gryffe and the White Cart,
because of the improvement in water quality achieved through the
expenditure of public money; that, and unremitting voluntary work on the
part of angling clubs in the area.
Until recent times, these streams have been little better than open
sewers, heavily polluted by industrial and human waste, incapable of
sustaining fish life in anything other than highwater conditions. Now,
as water quality improves, and will continue to improve, salmon and
sea-trout are returning in ever-increasing numbers.
It is the tide of public opinion, angler-led, that is washing these
rivers clean, not the care they have received from their owners,
proprietors of the land through which they flow. It is public concern,
not owner action, which has given the rivers renewed life. Consequently,
public interest must be represented in any plan for the future
management of these streams.
Two landowners, Mr Mark Crichton Maitland, of Elderslie Estates, and
Lord Maclay, of Duchal Estates, Kilmacolm, who are asking the Scottish
Secretary, Ian Lang, to approve the setting up of a new district salmon
fishery board, would do well to recognise this fact, and the alarm their
application has aroused amongst anglers.
Mr Crichton Maitland and Lord Maclay are within their rights to seek
the establishment of a new board. Provisions made in the Salmon Act,
1986, allow them to do so. District boards, comprising representatives
of proprietors of salmon fisheries in the area, are empowered, under the
terms of the Act, to manage their migratory fish systems.
There are 60 such boards throughout Scotland, although not every area
is covered, and they organise their joint affairs through the medium of
the Association of Scottish District Salmon Fishery Boards. These boards
have the responsibility, devolved from the Scottish Secretary, for the
proper care, management, and protection of Scottish salmon and sea-trout
systems.
The boards are advised, when advice is requested, by Government
scientists from the Pitlochry Freshwater Fisheries Research Laboratory
of the Scottish Office Agriculture Fishery Department; and the Pitlochry
laboratory also advises ministers on all matters in regard to the health
and welfare of Scottish salmon and sea-trout stocks.
The concern of Clydeside anglers is centred upon the way district
boards operate. They are autocratic, essentially answerable to nobody
other than themselves, and most of their business is conducted behind
closed doors. And have these boards, and their scientific advisers,
performed their duty effectively? Have they carefully protected,
nurtured, preserved, and enhanced Scottish salmon and sea-trout stocks?
The answer must be a resounding No: stocks of Scottish salmon and
sea-trout are now at their lowest level since records began and the
decline looks set to continue; in spite of widespread protest from
anglers and from the many rural businesses which depend upon visiting
anglers for their continued survival.
Anglers, therefore, and rightly so, have little enthusiasm for or
confidence in district salmon fishery boards. They are generally
conceived as being nothing other than ''lairds' angling clubs'', run by
landowners, managed by landowners,for the sole benefit of landowners.
Elitist, unrepresentative, private quangos.
There is no evidence to suggest the proposed new board, the Southern
Lower Clyde Salmon Fishery Board, will be any more democratic than the
rest; neither is there any reason to hope the board will be any more
effective in the management of its migratory fish stocks than its
established colleagues.
What is certain, however, is that the value of these rivers will
rocket. At present, given an annual catch of 100 salmon and 30
sea-trout, they would attract a market value of #500,000. This, at least
to me, seems to be the reason the owners want a district board: not to
protect migratory fish stocks, but rather to protect what they hope will
be a useful financial addition to their private property.
In presenting their case to the Scottish Secretary, the owners make no
provision for the claim of the public investment which has so enhanced
the value of their rivers; other than vague promises to ''in due course
. . . bring comprehensive management to all rivers and streams in the
area to the benefit of stocks''.
How they will achieve this, or who will pay the cost, is unclear.
Their statement that ''the angling clubs and associations which
presently fish in the area wil be able to continue doing so, and, it is
anticipated, enjoy improved angling as stocks increase'', has a hollow
ring. Perhaps, but how much will it cost them?
Before approving this application the Scottish Secretary must insist
upon full local angling-club representation. The chairman of the board
should be a member of one of the clubs who have strived so hard and for
so long to improve fishing in the area. And he must have a ''casting
vote'' in the event of any dispute.
Issues affecting migratory fish have become national and
international: ill-planned commercial forestry and the degradation of
spawning habitats; increasing acidification of our rivers and lochs;
unregulated industrial fishing for sand-eels, a primary food source for
post-smolt sea-trout and many salmon; pollution and sea-lice infestation
from fish-farm cages.
The money required to address these issues comes from public funds.
District salmon fishery boards should reflect this fact. I respect the
legal rights of the owners. They, in return, should respect the rights
of the people who increasingly foot the bill. The time has come for
change, and the Scottish Secretary could do no better than start that
process now: by ensuring full angler representation on the proposed
Southern Lower Clyde Salmon Fishery Board.

I READ with amazement your report that the Penal Affairs Consortium
are proposing that prison inmates should have big pay rises in order to
bring them more in line with wage earners on the outside (April 24).
At the same time, they are seeking smaller prison populations.
Do they not realise that the two are incompatible? If prison wages are
so raised, then populations are bound to rise when a large proportion of
the unemployed commit crimes in order to obtain well-paid jobs.

Oklahoma City, Wednesday
THE people of Oklahoma City observed a minute's silence today to
remember their dead, exactly a week after a huge bomb exploded and
ruined many of their lives.
As traffic came to a halt all over the city and sobbing people stood
in silence near the federal building gutted by a bomb, the medical
examiner's office said 92 bodies had been removed in a week of digging.
It said the dead included 14 children from a day-care centre in the
building. Some 105 people are still missing and an official source said
a second suspect hunted for the bombing could himself have been killed.
Medical examiner's office spokesman Ray Blakeney lowered the number of
children unaccounted for. He said five children were now missing,
sharply reducing earlier estimates that up to 25 could be in the rubble.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton declared Oklahoma City a major
disaster area so that federal aid could be granted.
Fire officals at the scene said they were about 12 hours from reaching
the spot in the rubble of the Murrah building which they believe has
become a mass grave for scores of people, from toddlers to pensioners
who were in a social security office.
Governor Frank Keating and about 50 firefighters and law-enforcement
officers stood with heads bowed next to the giant crater marking the
spot where the truck bomb exploded.
At schools throughout the city, children stood at their desks and
bowed their heads. Many drivers pulled over to the side of the road.
Federal agents are investigating whether ''John Doe 2'', the second
suspect in the deadly blast, could have been killed when the two-ton
bomb went off, an official source said.
''It's an active theory,'' a law enforcement source told Reuters.
''That is one reason why they are so closely examining (surveillance)
pictures from the area -- he may have got caught by the explosion.''
Only one person -- Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh -- has been
directly charged with the blast.--Reuter.

A MOVE to impose stricter control on football's financial dealings was
backed by the Commons yesterday.
Labour MP Kate Hoey told the House that the public and fans had to
have confidence in the national game: ''The governing bodies of sports'
rules were made for fair-minded, honest people.
''They cannot cope with the crooks of today or even the international
TV moguls.''
Her Professional Football Compliance Bill was given its formal first
reading without a vote, though due to lack of parliamentary time it
stands virtually no chance of becoming law.
Ms Hoey (Vauxhall) said: ''The 1994-95 football season will go down as
the one that brought the shameful headlines of bungs, corruption,
alleged match-fixing, drugs, racist abuse, violence on and off the
field, and greed.''
Her Bill would require the National Heritage Secretary to establish a
compliance unit for professional football in England and Wales with the
power to create and maintain proper financial controls and to report
irregularities.
Ms Hoey said it was 19 months since the Premier League Commission was
set up to inquire into allegations of undercover payments during
transfer deals and into the role of agents.
She said the Commission was established to examine the evidence by
Spurs chairman Alan Sugar in the High Court concerning the transfer of
striker Teddy Sheringham from Nottingham Forest to Tottenham.
The Commission had yet to report its findings.
Ms Hoey continued: ''The Commission still has also to report on the
links between Terry Venables when he was manager of Tottenham and Eric
Hall, the agent who was acting for both the club and the players in a
clear conflict of interest.
''And just a few days ago the Daily Mirror reported that a recent
payment of #34,000 had been made to Rune Hauge by Tottenham when Terry
Venables was manager, for the agent's role in the #480,000 transfer of
the Norwegian international player Erik Thorstvedt.
''Terry Venables clearly broke the FA rules when he was running Spurs,
authorising a whole range of payments to agents.
''Yet now he is running the English national team and the Premier
League Commission still have to clear him officially.
''Why the delay? Will we ever hear anything?''
She said the commission's only action had been to make one report on
George Graham, dismissed as Arsenal manager over claims about his
dealings with Hauge.
''Isn't it time we had some answers from the Commission?''

Raymond Duncan reports from the Police Federation's annual conference
in Peebles
TIGHTER controls on the ''killer'' drug temazepam seem set to be
imposed soon, Scottish Home Affairs Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie
indicated yesterday at the Scottish Police Federation annual conference
at Peebles.
Describing this as the key drug issue in Scotland at present, the
Minister is seeking a hardline approach to the drug, which is also known
as jellies and is said to change users' personalities.
Last week, Mrs Irene Adams, the MP for Paisley North, called for
tighter curbs on the supply of temazepam, in the wake of a spate of
shootings in her constituency.
Police have confirmed the upsurge of gun violence in the area is drug
related and an escalation in drug deaths in Glasgow was recently
attributed largely to its use.
Lord Fraser's clear hint about veering towards re-classification of
the drug did not, however, meet the demand from the federation's
chairman Jim Fraser to have temazepam banned.
He told the Minister that members of the medical profession, reformed
abusers, and those who had recovered from dependency on prescribed
temazepam wanted it outlawed.
''You can now add the voice of the Scottish Police Federation,''
declared the chairman, who said that when misused temazepam was a
''killer''.
''Temazepam, a drug for which there are many safer alternatives, has
claimed umpteen lives and until something is done it will continue to
claim lives.''
Calling for further firm action to combat misuse, he also warned that
deaths in Scotland from drugs abuse could be three times the official
figures.
The Minister told police officers that there had been many calls for
temazepam to be more tightly controlled but the issues were complex.
Veering from his prepared text, Lord Fraser said that, such was the
scale of the problem in some parts of Scotland, he recognised very
clearly this was probably the country's current key drug issue.
He said the Scottish Office was now re-examining the position it had
adopted on the scheduling of temazepam, and he hoped to have a decision
soon.
Later, he told reporters that a rescheduling of the Class 4 drug to
Class 3 would tighten up control of its use and make it more difficult
for people to obtain it.
Lord Fraser also said he was greatly encouraged that the number of
recorded crimes in Scotland had fallen for a third successive year.
The federation's chairman voiced anxieties about the fixed-term
appointments for senior ranks, claiming this would damage their
political independence -- ''a bedrock of democracy which promotes the
freedoms so jealously guarded in this country''.
He said the federation felt police political independence had been
''seriously wounded'' by their introduction.
There was also concern at the inconsistency at the way Glasgow and
Edinburgh dealt with prostitution.
A motion by a Lothian and Borders police officer attempted to
highlight the ''differing methods'' used in the country's two main
cities.
In recent months, police in Edinburgh as well as the local authority
have been accused of turning a blind eye to premises which many claim
are fronts for prostitution.
Constable Norman MacLeod said yesterday that, in both cities, street
prostitution was still considered an offence and officers were
encouraged to enforce the law.
However, he said: ''Edinburgh District Council has in their wisdom
embarked on a stand whereby they have licensed saunas as places of
public entertainment, even although it is known that many of them are
used for pseudo-sexual or sexual purposes of some sort or other.''
Mr MacLeod said people would say that, if sex was on sale in saunas,
then it must be safer for the prostitute and should result in less
sexual attacks on the street. ''If that is the case, why do these people
not come out and say let's licence brothels.
He said obviously if saunas could sell sex the menace of the kerb
crawler would be a thing of the past but the ''traffic'' to the doors of
saunas would be greatly increased.
''The thought of residential areas now becoming red light districts is
as unappealing.''

AM I the only one who looks with a jaundiced eye on the bleeding-heart
letters suddenly appearing in your columns (April 25 and 26)?
I refer to the imminent demise of Scottish Nuclear and the letters
from the captains of industry who are suddenly bewailing the loss of
Scotland's assets.
Where have these people been for the last 15 or so years? Why are they
only shouting when their own particular babies are affected?
As someone who has from time to time has earned his living from
Torness and Hunterston, I have no wish to see them being swallowed up by
an English concern, but when one considers that, because of the large
number of English companies which are even now employed as contractors
on these sites, excluding the profits which will go to Westminster
anyway, most of the money earned by Scottish Nuclear already goes south
of the Border.
I can't see that sending the management's salaries there as well would
actually change much.
Unless of course we get independence. But then, isn't it people like
the captains of industry who are against such a move?

HIGHEST commendations for the newsview coverage of the bittersweet
life of a typical Scottish hill-farmer (April 24).
I don't know how Anne Simpson can create such a wonderful mix of
poetic prose (her opening description of a sunswept hillside); a host of
down-to-earth descriptions of the trials and tribulations and pleasures
and joys of the farmer's life; a succession of interesting farming
opinions on such diverse matters as a neighbour's love of his pigs and
the poor performance of British industry versus British farming; and
then finish so concisely with feelings that for many of us would drag on
for days when we must ruefully retreat from the pull of the land.
Once again Anne Simpson has created a masterpiece of description out
of a brief visit to Mr Scott's few square miles, has listened with an
attentive ear, and shown a deep emotional link with the subject. Surely
she can't be other than a farmer's daughter.
Compliments also to John Scott for having communicated so well, and
for having presented such a fine figure to Angela Catlin's camera. He
would stand out from a whole host of male film-stars past and present.
Maybe he missed many other callings; but he has a special bond to the
one he is following.

TEMAZEPAM, a cheap and popular choice of benzodiazepine for people
with short-term sleeping difficulties, has become a victim of its own
success. The main reason why it, as opposed to other drugs of its type,
has become a popular drug of abuse is its wide availability in its
legitimate role, writes ALAN MacDERMID, Medical Correspondent.
This increases the risk of leakage into the black market through
over-prescribing -- some patients, including pensioners, are believed to
sell on their own prescribed supplies -- through thefts from shops and
wholesalers, and through corruption in the trade.
The Department of Health has been aware of the problem for some time;
one of the reasons for its reluctance to re-classify it until now is
because it is a generic drug made by various manufacturers and the
alternatives are dearer.
Temazepam kills in two ways -- addicts inject the jelly from inside
the capsule form and risk potentially lethal circulation problems like
thrombosis and gangrene.
Even orally, however, its abuse has its dangers. Last month, Dr
Richard Hammersley, of Glasgow University's behavioural sciences group,
blamed drug cocktails of temazepam and heroin for many of the 100
drug-related deaths in Strathclyde last year.
Dr John Garner, chairman of the British Medical Association's Scottish
GP's committee, said yesterday that re-classification would mean a
''little bit'' of extra work for prescribing doctors but most would
recognise the need for this to control the drug's abuse.

TORY Euro-rebel Michael Carttiss has confirmed that he will accept
John Major's restoration of the party whip.
Mr Carttiss (Great Yarmouth), who has operated alone since his
expulsion from the parliamentary party, is the eighth of the erstwhile
rebels to fall back into line.
''I am always buoyant and never more so than when someone tells me:
'Michael, you were right and we were wrong','' an unrepentant Mr
Carttiss said last night.
''The Prime Minister took something away that belonged to me and not
to him. He has now given it back. I have nothing to apologise for.''
The ninth remaining rebel, Sir Richard Body -- who, unlike the others,
resigned the Whip rather than having it withdrawn -- was consulting in
his Holland-with-Boston constituency in Lincolnshire -- before deciding
whether to accept the invitation to return.
Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday criticised
European bureaucrats for ''too much poking'' into Britain's national
life.
Mr Hurd, who has faced criticism from Tory Euro-sceptics for being too
pro-Europe, pledged he would work towards resolving the problem of
over-regulation in the EU.
''I am not starry-eyed about our place in Europe. The European Union
is far from perfect,'' he said.
''There is too much waste and fraud. There remains a problem of
over-regulation and interference by the Commission -- too much poking
into the nooks and crannies of national life.''
Mr Hurd was writing in the foreword of his bi-annual report to
Parliament on events in Europe and Britain's role in the Union.
VISCOUNT Tonypandy, a former Commons Speaker and Labour MP, launched
an outspoken attack on the power of Brussels yesterday in a move likely
to reopen European divisions on both sides of the House.
He broke with the tradition which stops former Speakers entering party
political debates to call for a national referendum on European
integration.
In a letter to The Times, he warned that Westminster was in ''dire
danger of being denuded of its responsibilities'' and that no political
party had a mandate from the electorate to surrender national
sovereignty to Europe.
His intervention will delight the former rebels who have pledged to
keep up their crusade against the ''nightmare'' of Brussels.
However, it also threatens to reopen splits over Europe on Labour's
side.
Viscount Tonypandy, a respected figure who was MP for Cardiff West and
was Speaker for more than seven years, attacked the prospect of
Westminster bowing to a European assembly ''controlled by a hotchpotch
of European politicians and bureacrats''.
He said he had decided to speak out because he felt the question of
national sovereignty ''towers above all''.

BUSINESSES in Scotland are being unfairly penalised under the new
uniform business rate and revaluation, it was claimed in the Commons
yesterday.
Liberal Democrat Archy Kirkwood (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) suggested
that the rate poundage had been set too high at 43.2p.
He said it could have been set two or three pence lower and insisted
there were legitimate concerns about the effect on business viability.
''Even with transitional protection, many of my constituents will face
significant increases in rate bills in 1995-96 and later years,'' he
said.
Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch rejected the charges,
saying: ''Over the last five years, the Government has been
progressively reducing the rates burden on Scottish businesses.''

THE ''quickie'' divorce on grounds of adultery or unreasonable
behaviour is expected to be abolished in England and Wales under
Government proposals due to be announced today.
The move will mean couples will have to wait at least a year before
being granted a divorce and only after disputes over children, property
and finance are resolved.
However, in Scotland Ministers are considering recommendations by the
Scottish Law Commission which would cut the time couples must wait
before their marriages are dissolved.
A Scottish Office spokesman said that in Scotland about 60% of couples
filed for divorce on grounds of separation. At present, if both partners
consent, the waiting period is two years. If one objects to the divorce,
the waiting period is five years. The commission want these periods to
be reduced to one year and two years respectively.
South of the Border, three-quarters of couples seek a quick divorce,
which takes six months to obtain on average, although some are granted
within three months.
However, the Government proposals, expected in a White Paper on
divorce law reform to be unveiled by the Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay
today, could go some way to cutting the divorce rate.
''It was felt that the present system doesn't do anything to save
marriages and often leads to unnecessary acrimony,'' said a spokesman at
the Lord Chancellor's Department.
The proposals in the White Paper for England were welcomed last night
by Ms Susan Matheson, director of Family Mediation Scotland.
''It removes the adultery and unreasonable behaviour grounds. We know
that when they are used, there are more disputes among the parents and
that is bad for the children'' she said.
''They give an opportunity for parents to get information they need,
learn about the implications for their children and give them a period
of reflection.''
Ms Matheson said that, while the Scottish divorce rate was lower,
there was good reason to follow the example of reform in England.
''I think we will be encouraging Scotland to be moving towards the
English system. We will be asking for an early meeting with Scottish
Office Minister Lord Fraser to discuss the whole issue'' she added.
Under the present system, divorces are granted if it can be shown that
a marriage has irretrievably broken down using one of five criteria:
adultery; unreasonable behaviour; desertion for at least two years;
living apart for two years where both parties consent to divorce; living
apart for five years where one party is unwilling to divorce.
The English proposals would replace those requirements with the
12-month ''cooling off'' period, during which couples should reflect on
their decision and sort out financial and property matters.
The proposals are expected to require couples seeking a split to
attend an interview session in which experts explain about conciliation
services, legal steps and the procedures involved in divorce. This
option is already open to couple in Scotland who can be referred by the
courts to mediation services.

CLAIMS that the Crown Office had acted improperly over recent guidance
it gave to the Government over the Lockerbie affair were rejected by
Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd yesterday.
Former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart was concerned that the
Crown Office had suggested in a document that he had financial links
with the Asian business community in the West of Scotland, which
influenced his stance on the affair, and that the Crown Office had
sought to ''rubbish'' his recent trip to Libya.
The matter was raised by Linlithgow Labour MP Tam Dalyell, but Miss
Boothroyd said: ''You are concerned that the comments made in the paper
may be an imputation against a Member which might be regarded as a
contempt.
''I do not think this is so. The language used in the document is
neither so grossly abusive nor likely to amount to such an interference
with a Member's freedom of action as to amount to contempt.''

IT was kind of The Herald to allow its full back page to be given to a
sheep-farmer to complain that the farming community is just so terribly
misunderstood and misjudged by an unsympathetic public (April 24).
Unfortunately it just doesn't wash.
People are sick to death of the inherent cruelty of intensive factory
farms and were very shocked recently when Advocates for Animals exposed
the brutal treatment handed out to farm animals at markets all over
Scotland.
For very many different reasons -- compassion for animals, health
scares like BSE, detestation of live exports -- more and more people are
becoming vegetarian. Perhaps Mr Scott is wise not to encourage his
children to become farmers; in many ways it is now a dying trade.

By Our Political Staff
SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang and his deputy, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie,
face some tough talking from alarmed Scottish Tory leaders at private
meetings in Glasgow and Edinburgh on Saturday.
The Ministers are to attend meetings respectively of the western and
eastern area councils of the party, hoping to hear constructive
suggestions about where the party should go from its crushing defeat in
the local elections, which left it without control of a single one of
the new councils it set up and with only 11% of the Scottish vote.
There is likely to be a number of complaints from constituency
leaders, councillors and ex-councillors that national policies cost the
party dear at local level.
There will be a tendency to ventilate grievances at the closed-door
sessions rather than in the open at the annual conference in Glasgow,
starting on May 10. The Ministers, while understanding that many of the
faithful feel sore at the result, will seek to turn the discussion in a
constructive direction.
Mr Lang said: ''We will listen to their anxieties and consider
together what we should be doing in the months ahead.'' He said he
personally had ''very clear ideas''.
One policy that will not change is opposition to devolution, as Mr
Lang made clear in exchanges in the Commons yesterday when he faced
triumphalist Scottish Labour MPs who repeatedly reminded Mr Lang of his
party's electoral disaster.
They roared with laughter when Mr Patrick McLoughlin (Derbyshire West
-- Con.) said the Scottish result at least disproved the Opposition
claims that the Government had gerrymandered local government reform to
its own advantage.
Mr Lang, smiling, said he could not recommend his English colleagues
to follow Scottish examples in all respects.
Making clear that there would be no change of directuion, Mr Lang told
the House: ''I am confident that the policies being pursued by the
Government are the right ones.
''They are delivering excellent results in all the main theatres in of
government activity and will increasingly prove to do so.''
He promised that the party would learn from the ''extremely
disappointing'' Scottish council results and he forecast that the
Conservatives would gain more Scottish seats at the next General
Election.
Councillor John Young, leader of the Opposition Tory group of only
three on the new single-tier Glasgow Council, is likely to attend the
meeting with Mr Lang on Saturday.
However, he emphasised his disappointment that the party in Scotland
had refused to agree to the Cathcart Conservatives' call for a special
closed-session, one-day conference in Scotland later in the year, with
the Prime Minister attending.
''I fear we are just going to go over the same old ground at this sort
of meeting with Mr Lang'' he said.
''We warned Ministers and party officials that a political holocaust
could ensue at the local elections and I am sorry to say we were
right.''
The leader of the 14 Tories on the new single-tier Edinburgh council
Daphne Sleigh will be attending the meeting between Lord Fraser and
party activists and councillors in the capital.
She said ''I am sure there will be some fairly robust exchanges with
the Minister. It is very important now to achieve a far better
understanding and an acceptance by ministers and party officials that we
are all in this together.
''The activists are no longer willing to be fobbed off. They are
determined to tell the Government what they are hearing on the
doorsteps. These people are entitled to be heard.''
Councillor Sleigh said Lord Fraser would hear concerns about the
progress of a number of Government policies and the detail of their
implementation.
LABOUR will go into the English local elections tomorrow week with a
commanding 30 point lead over the Tories, according to a new opinion
poll.
The Mori poll for The Times gives Labour 56% -- one point down on last
month -- while the Tories are one point up on 26%. The Liberal Democrats
are also up, by two points, on 15%.
However, a survey of voting intentions specifically in the local
elections puts Labour even further ahead. Of the 48% of respondents who
said that they would definitely be voting, 55% said they would be
supporting Labour, giving them a 33 point lead over the Tories on 22%.
The Liberal Democrats were just four points behind the Conservatives
with 18%.

FROM time to time in recent weeks we have individually taken your
paper to task for what, from our separate points of view, we regarded as
the development of a serious lack of political balance and a noticeable
deterioration in the standard of journalism generally.
It give us great pleasure therefore to pay tribute to the high
standard of the pieces by Michael Fry and Patrick Brogan (April 19).
It is also fitting to recognise the extremely high and consistent
quality of the regular contributions by Nicholas Powell. Having spent
seven long years in Paris we are sick and tired of the dishonest,
slanted reporting of French affairs that we read week after week in
other papers.
In that context it is long past time that Murray Ritchie was
despatched to some other home of an independence-minded minority -- like
Sri Lanka. Perhaps that might lead him to realise what life is like in
the real world outside the blinkered mental confines of the SNP and the
privileged bureaucracy of Brussels.
And may we express the hope that perhaps one day in the not too
distant future John Macleod may complete the painful process of growing
up -- a process which would be immeasurably accelerated if he would
spend just a little time further than 30 miles from the Western Isles.

A MOTHER yesterday relived the moment a bogus health visitor tried to
snatch her fourmonthold baby girl.
She also warned parents: ''Don't let anybody in your door. Telephone
the health centre first. Even if they're convincing, don't let them
in.''
The woman had produced what appeared to be official Lothian Health
Board identification, said Mrs Lynne Stewart.
The 35-year-old mother oftwo described how the smartly-dressed woman
had called at the family home in South Gyle, Edinburgh, posing as a
health visitor on Tuesday afternoon. She had cradled and admired baby
Erin before asking to see her birth certificate.
Mrs Stewart said she had gone upstairs to find the document, when she
became suspicious.
''I heard a noise. I don't know what made me look downstairs. She had
Erin on her hip with her briefcase in her hand, opening the front door
to get out.
''She was half out the front door and the baby was screaming and
absolutely hysterical. I shouted and came down the stairs. There was a
struggle and I lashed out at her. It was the only way I could get the
baby back.
''The baby fell halfway on to the step and the carpet. I quickly shut
the door and called the police,'' she said.
Cuddling her daughter with husband Michael by her side, Mrs Stewart
said she had punched the woman who had attempted to grab her child.
The mother, who also has a four-year-old son Ryan, said she had been
badly shaken by the incident and had spent the night being comforted by
her family.
She described the woman as ''very convincing'', and said she was
concerned by the knowledge the woman appeared to have.
She said: ''I would like to know how she knew my name and how she knew
Erin's name. She seemed to know a lot about me. How did she find out?''.
Mrs Stewart said she would do it again if anyone tried to snatch her
child.''I think any mother would have done the same,'' she added.
Husband Michael said he was ''very proud'' of his wife.
Detective Chief Inspector Brian Doneghen, leading the hunt for the
woman who tried to snatch the youngster, said the attempted abduction
was being linked with another incident in the city.
He said: ''Similarities, particularly with an incident at Hermiston
Crescent a fortnight ago, are being closely examined.
''The motives are unclear but it is possible that this woman is
desperate to have physical possession of a baby.''
He renewed an appeal for information and help in tracing the woman.
Mr David Pigott of Edinburgh Health Care Trust, which administers the
city's health visitor service, said staff identification should have the
trust's name clearly visible and visitors should have cards linked to
their surgery.
He stressed that many calls by health visitors were now agreed in
advance by telephone.
''Even if one of our health visitors appear on the doorstep, mothers
can say thank you, but it's not convenient at the moment and check on
their identity with their GP's surgery,'' said Mr Pigott.
He said the trust would be issuing a circular to all parents with
children under the age of five, with clear guidelines over staff
identification and the steps for parents to take in cases of suspicion.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair has been asked to explain a free Concorde
trip to the United States he is said to have made without declaring it
in the MPs' Commons register, it emerged last night.
Chairman of the Members' Interests select committee Sir Geoffrey
Johnson Smith has also written to Labour's deputy leader John Prescott
about an undeclared stay at Gleneagles Hotel.
The move comes after an official complaint to the committee by Tory
back bencher David Shaw, who first raised the allegations.
MPs are automatically asked to respond to any official complaint that
the committee receives.
Labour has dismissed any suggestion of impropriety by the two men and
accused Mr Shaw of mounting a ''dirty tricks'' campaign.
The trip by Mr Blair -- then a Treasury spokesman -- was made at the
request of the Government as part of an all-party delegation to lobby US
officials to cut taxes paid by British firms there.
Labour said Mr Prescott's hotel stay was part of a speaking engagement
at an energy conference he attended in his official capacity as an
Opposition spokesman.
A number of Tory MPs who attended the conference also did not declare
it in the Register of Members' Interests.
Mr Shaw said: ''If they have broken the rules, that is disgraceful.
Because they are both senior MPs they should be treated more severely
than junior MPs who break the rules.''
A spokesman for the Labour leader said: ''Mr Blair looks forward to
the opportunity of dealing with this complaint raised by David Shaw,
which he regards as frivolous.''

JACK McLean refers to the United Free Presbyterian Church (April 21).
There never has been such an institution and he must surely mean the
United Free Church of Scotland, which was formed in 1900 as a result of
the union between the United Presbyterian Church and the Free Church of
Scotland.
The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland was formed in 1893 when about
14,000 individuals seceded from the Free Church of Scotland.

He warned against an ''inward looking attitude'' which could result in

PRODUCERS of newsprint for the newspaper industry are suspected of
operating an illegal price cartel, the European Commission said
yesterday.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition Commissioner, disclosed that Brussels
investigators and officials from various agencies of EU member states
had co-operated in carrying out a series of raids on paper producers
throughout the Community. The results of the raids are being evaluated
by Commission officials.
Heavy fines are likely for any companies held to have been operating a
cartel. The matter could be resolved by the end of this year, a
commission official said.
The Commission is empowered to punish companies which break EU
competition law. Recently, it imposed fines of millions of pounds on
firms operating cartels in the steel and cement sectors.
The raids came after complaints from several governments and
publishers throughout the EU that newsprint manufacturers were imposing
unfair charges. The bulk of the newsprint industry in the EU was covered
by the inquiry, the commission said.
Mr Van Miert told reporters: ''I understand the importance of this to
newspapers. The cost of paper can be up to 20% or 25% of total costs.
This could jeopardise certain newspapers.''
Caledonian Newspapers, which owns The Herald and Evening Times, said
last night there had been a 15% rise in its newsprint costs between last
September and the beginning of this year. ''Another big rise is in the
pipeline later this year,'' a management official said.
Although the Commission did not say which firms had been raided, it is
understood that 40 were involved across the EU. The Commission took a
particular interest in companies doing business in member states
including the UK, Finland, Sweden, France, Austria, Italy, and Germany.
Mr Van Miert said the results of the raids suggested ''a possibility
of unfair or collusive behaviour''. However, he emphasised that nothing
had yet been proved.
A commission spokesman said the raids had been carried out without
warning to prevent vital evidence being shredded.
''This is about investigating possible anti-competitive behaviour on
the basis of complaints we have had -- no more, no less.''
Mr Van Miert confirmed the inquiry covered almost all the EU newsprint
sector but it did not cover pulp. Asked about the probable outcome, he
replied: ''I cannot go further than that.''
* Mr Van Miert also announced yesterday he favoured ending the
widespread practice in the motor industry where manufacturers insist on
having exclusive franchises. He said he wanted customers to have the
widest possible choice.
The commissioner said new plans would improve the commercial
independence of car dealers by allowing them to buy spares from
independent manufacturers.

A CALL from Channel 4's chief executive, Mr Michael Grade, for quick
legislation to stop Mr Rupert Murdoch gaining a stake in the new Channel
5 was rejected by the Government yesterday.
National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell defended Government policy
on media ownership against strong criticism from Mr Grade, who warned
that a Murdoch foothold in British terrestrial television would be
''enormous and damaging''.
There would always be the threat that Coronation Street and its
audiences could move to Channel 5, Mr Grade added.
A consortium led by Mirror Group and the American broadcaster NBC has
pulled out of the bidding for the new channel, it was learned yesterday.
A brief statement from the Mirror Group said: ''The consortium has
decided for a variety of reasons not to go forward with the bid for
Channel 5.''
Mr Murdoch, who controls the satellite company BSkyB and owns five
national newspapers, is expected to bid for the licence. The closing
date for applications is May 2.
Mr Grade said the Government could pass urgently a one-line Bill,
giving the Independent Television Commission wider discretion in its
coming deliberations to ignore the highest bid in awarding the Channel 5
licence, or it could wait until new ownership rules were in place.
''He (Mr Murdoch) would be in the most dominating position that any
media baron has ever been in in this country.
''BSkyB has more revenue than any other broadcaster in this country.
He owns 36% of the press. Once he has got a foothold in terrestrial, he
will be in a position to dominate. Even ITV with all its money won't be
able to stop (him),'' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
However, Mr Dorrell said: ''The Broadcasting Act of 1990 sets in place
a series of tough regulatory provisions -- many people argue too tough
-- on the expansion of broadcasting businesses.
''I agree with Michael Grade that those need to be reviewed. They are
being reviewed. I think the way to review them is with proper
deliberation, not to come forward with a one-clause Bill at a week's
notice.''
Earlier, Mr Grade, who will be the next president of the Royal
Television Society, said Mr Murdoch exploited a loophole in broadcasting
regulations when he introduced Sky.
''Looking at the record, you might be forgiven for thinking that the
Government's chief policy objective for broadcasting has been to get
things as wrong as they could,'' he told the British Journalism Review
on Tuesday night.
He added: ''How lucky for Mrs Thatcher's friend and supporter, Mr
Murdoch. He was now in the unique position of being free to build a
multi-channel television business totally directed at the UK population,
whilst at the same time owning over a third of the British press.''
BSkyB has condemned Mr Grade's comments as ill informed and ill
judged.

LORD FRASER knows all about how police time is wasted by having to
attend court trials.
He told yesterday about about how his car had been stolen frequently
in Edinburgh.
Each time, a policeman had to call at his home with the appropriate
form, so that Lord Fraser could attend court and state that the ''rather
dirty banger'' was his.
Speaking to the conference, he said his evidence was never questioned
and he was never cross-examined. It was, he said, a waste of his time
and that of the policeman who also required to attend the court.
Lord Fraser said later that his old Triumph Herald was frequently
stolen, only later to be recovered in another part of the city.
He said: ''I considered that going to court in circumstances like that
was a significant waste of police time.''
Lord Fraser said that the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, currently
before Parliament, was designed to improve the efficiency of the
criminal justice system and aimed to make policemens' jobs a lot easier.
It would mean that, in certain circumstances, hundreds of police
officers would not have to go to court to give evidence, because of the
introduction of intermediate diets.
Some sheriff courts in Edinburgh, Dundee, Dunfermline, and Kirkcaldy
have already introduced such a system.
In Edinburgh alone, 500 police witnesses were being countermanded each
month, in Dunfermline 150 a month, and in Dundee and Kirkcaldy about 100
a month.
Lord Fraser said that, if a similar effect were to be obtained in all
Scottish courts, then about 70,000 police officer days in court would be
saved each year.

THE United Kingdom was threatened with court action last night by Mr
Neil Kinnock if the Government defies the European Commission and signs
a civil aviation deal with the Americans, writes MURRAY RITCHIE.
Mr Kinnock, in his first major political test as the EU's transport
commissioner, won unanimous backing from his colleagues in Brussels, at
the Commission's weekly meeting yesterday, for his tough stand on the
''open skies'' policy which is supposed to lead eventually to
American-style cheap air travel in the community.
The Commission adopted a mandate for Mr Kinnock allowing him to move
against EU member states which sign bilateral deals with American
carriers who want wider access to slots inside the EU. However, last
night, it was clear that six countries are determined to fight the
Commission's insistence that it alone must negotiate for all 15 EU
member states.
As Mr Kinnock was speaking to reporters in Brussels, the Swedes and
Danes were preparing initial bilateral deals with the Americans. The US
Government has also encouraged Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Finland
to defy the Commission.
Asked if he was prepared to take governments to the European Court of
Justice on the issue, Mr Kinnock replied: ''Be in no doubt . . .''
The EU has spent years planning cheaper air travel but has balked at
following the American experience of what Mr Kinnock called ''swift and
sharp'' deregulation. This, he argued, had led to the loss of 100,000
airline jobs since 1989.
Mr Kinnock said he wanted an open skies deal which was ''fair,
balanced, and reciprocal'' and which did not involve predatory pricing
or dumping. It should sustain public services in peripheral regions,
respect the environment, and ensure safe travel.
Opening up Europe through a series of bilateral deals between
individual member states and the US would leave the EU vulnerable to a
policy which was ''not just America first, but America first, last, both
ways across the Atlantic and within and beyond Europe'', he said.
His threat of legal sanctions will be examined closely in Whitehall.

THE historic right of the Church of Scotland to run its own affairs,
free from interference by the Court of Session, the country's supreme
civil court, was underlined by a judge yesterday.
Lord Osborne accepted the Kirk's argument that in spiritual matters it
derives its authority, not from Parliament, but from Jesus Christ.
The judge lifted an interim interdict he granted last month to the Rev
Tom Logan, of Abbotsford Manse, Clydebank. The court order overturned a
decision of Dumbarton Presbytery to suspend Mr Logan from his work in
the parish, pending a disciplinary hearing.
The minister is in dispute with the Church over his activities as an
agent for Amway, a company which specialises in soap products and in
recruiting sales agents. The Church has refused permission for him to
engage in business activities.
Mr Logan claimed he had been denied a full opportunity of defending
himself against allegations made against him and that the procedures
adopted by the presbytery were in breach of natural justice.
In a written decision issued yesterday, Lord Osborne said that in
asking to have the interim interdict lifted, the Church argued that
spiritual matters fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of its own
courts.
Mr Alastair Dunlop, QC, who appeared for the Church of Scotland, had
reassured the court that the law and practice of the Church would
require the observance of the rules of natural justice in a case such as
Mr Logan's.
Mr Dunlop submitted that the Church of Scotland Act 1921 amounted to a
recognition by Parliament that, in certain matters, the Church had an
exclusive jurisdiction free from interference by the civil authority.
The Church was not subject to judicial review of its decisions by the
Court of Session in matters of doctrine, worship, government, and
discipline. Mr Logan's case was a matter of Church discipline.
It had, all along, asserted that its jurisdiction in matters spiritual
derived from Jesus Christ and the 1921 Act was a recognition that this
claim was correct.
Lord Osborne said he had reached the conclusion that the interim
interdict must be recalled because the issue raised by Mr Logan was not
one which the Court of Session had a jurisdiction to entertain.
The judge referred to the 1921 Act and the Articles Declaratory of the
Constitution of the Church of Scotland in Matters Spiritual, which were
given legal effect by the Act.
Article IV states: ''This Church, as part of the Universal Church
wherein the Lord Jesus Christ has appointed a government in the hands of
Church office-bearers, receives from Him, its Divine King and Head, and
from Him alone, the right and power, subject to no civil authority, to
legislate and to adjudicate finally in all matters of doctrine, worship,
government, and discipline in the Church.''
Lord Osborne said it was accepted that Mr Logan's case involved a
matter of discipline and it followed that the subject matter fell within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Church of Scotland in
terms of Declaratory Article IV.
In his opinion, the courts of the Church of Scotland could not be
compared with any tribunal upon which a power had been conferred by
Parliament.
''It appears to me that what was achieved in the Act of 1921 was a
recognition by Parliament of certain pre-existing inherent powers in the
Church of Scotland, rather than the conferring of powers upon it.
''Parliament has recognised that, within the sphere of the Church's
spiritual government and jurisdiction, the civil authority has been
denied any right of interference.''
Dumbarton Presbytery was not represented at the original hearing at
the Court of Session, and Lord Osborne made it clear yesterday that if
he had been presented with full legal arguments at the time, he would
probably not have granted his original order.
A Church spokesman commented: ''The Church of Scotland is pleased to
note that that judgment supports the view of the constitutional
relationship of Church and State, with particular reference to the
jurisdiction of the respective courts, which it has always taken.''
Mr Logan's ''trial'' under kirk procedures, originally due to take
place on April 19 and 20, did not go ahead pending Lord Osborne's
decision. No date has yet been fixed for a new hearing.
Mr Logan said yesterday that he had not yet had a chance to see Lord
Osborne's decision.

A SCOTTISH animal rights group last night condemned letter-bomb
attacks by animal extremists on individuals and private companies.
The group -- Advocates for Animals -- said such extreme measures would
alienate the public and get no sympathy for the cause. They appealed to
the militant activists to talk rather than use bombs.
An anti-terrorist team from New Scotland Yard are co-ordinating
inquiries into attacks on a Glasgow fur company and an Edinburgh
health-care firm on Tuesday. They are also investigating letter bombs
sent to Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave and Defence Secretary
Tom King on the same day.
Mr Les Ward, director of Advocates for Animals, which has 12,000
members, said: ''Actions like letter bombs will get no sympathy from the
public.
''We believe there are no options to replace the need for animals in
things like cancer, cystic fibrosis, and AIDS testing. In areas like
cosmetics, people are sympathetic to our cause and there is no need to
send letter bombs to get that message across.''
Mr Ward said he had set up a working group on animal research called
The Boyd Group, consisting of animal welfare workers, medical
organisations, vets, and scientists.
He added: ''Our discussions have been frank, wide-ranging, and
constructive. Many of us were surprised at the extent of the agreement
obtained on important issues.''

SCOTTISH tourism chiefs expressed confidence yesterday that the
industry was recovering after one of its worst years, with the message
to potential visitors that ''Scotland is open 52 weeks a year''.
Overall, tourism expenditure in Scotland fell by 6% in 1994. Although
there was a 2% growth from overseas visitors, spending by UK residents
dropped by 10% from #1455m to #1310m.
''It was certainly not a year that will go down in the annals of
tourism history in Scotland,'' according to Mr Ian Grant, Scottish
Tourist Board chairman.
However, he was optimistic about the prospects for this year and said
a new range of promotions launched by the board were already producing
encouraging results.
Since the Scottish Office's review of the tourism industry and the
organisations involved in it, the STB has re-appraised its marketing
output and produced campaigns which have targeted England, Scotland,
France, Germany, and the United States.
''The quality and scale of new promotions from Scotland has provided
the industry with a surge of confidence for 1995 that is in marked
contrast to the prevailing mood last year,'' Mr Grant told a news
conference at Scotland's Travel Fair at the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre in Glasgow.
''Although it is too early to predict a bumper year, the advance
booking and inquiry figures from the tourist information centres is very
encouraging, with areas like Inverness, the West Highlands, and the
Western Isles showing huge increases in inquiry levels.''
For instance, he said, inquiries for the Western Isles had risen by
more than 300%.
STB chief executive, Mr Derek Reid, said a major factor in last year's
decline had been the large reduction in English holidaymakers.
The board had aimed new campaigns at English visitors and at
encouraging Scots to explore their own country. These campaigns were
partly responsible for the increase in inquiry levels this year, he
said.
''The UK holiday market is our problem child,'' said Mr Tim Hailey,
director of UK marketing. ''We believe the solution is for Scotland to
become an all-year-round destination, particularly for short breaks.''
Mr Grant observed: ''We have got to make people aware that Scotland is
open 52 weeks a year and that accessing Scotland from England is not
like heading for the North Pole. Also, there is a great untapped
Scotland that Scots themselves do not really appreciate.''
Overseas marketing director, Mr Tom Buncle, said new overseas
campaigns would be boosted by the worldwide publicity surrounding the
spate of films like Rob Roy which have been shot in Scotland recently.
0 Mr Reid stressed that the board's campaigns would be effective only
if tourism were taken seriously as a business, if the trade put its
weight behind new initiatives, and if the quality of the product matched
consumer expectations.
The travel fair, a showcase for Scottish tourism, has attracted 270
exhibitors and 900 buyers.
New campaigns being launched include: The Natural Cooking of Scotland,
designed to promote Scottish produce; Tourism and the Environment,
highlighting the quality of the natural environment with a new Wild in
Scotland publication; Autumn Gold, designed to extend the tourist season
through special offers and discounts; and Tourism and the Arts,
promoting Scotland's cultural heritage and major events such as the 1996
bi-centenary of Robert Burns.

ROTHESAY BAY could be the location for the latest water sports
development for the Clyde. A new centre to expand sailing, diving,
windsurfing, and dinghy racing is being planned by Isle of Bute Sailing
Club.
Plans for the scheme are progressing along with those for a #3m
three-star hotel and a 150-berth marina and breakwater at West Bay,
Rothesay, to be built by Carluke-based MacDonald Developments
(Scotland).
Agreement in principle to the inclusion of the IBSC's development of
the water sport centre on the club's existing site in the overall scheme
has been reached between the developer Mr Ronnie MacDonald and the IBSC.
Mr MacDonald said: ''The IBSC's proposals and future objectives for a
new water-sports scheme are fully supported and I believe the economies
of scale that can be achieved through a joint development programme are
significant.
''The club has an important role to play as one of the leading sailing
and water sports venues on the Clyde and this will be complementary to
what we wish to achieve with the West Bay project.''
IBSC's Commodore, Mr Ray Dalton, added: ''We are most encouraged that,
under the proposals by MacDonald Developments for this site, the IBSC's
plans for the expansion of waterborne activities on the Clyde have now
been further advanced.''
Rothesay West Councillor Gordon Mason said: ''I fully support these
new proposals for the West Bay.''

THE future of a permanent all-year ferry service across Loch Fyne,
linking Tarbert in Kintyre to Portavadie on the Cowal Peninsula, has
taken a step forward.
A plea by Tarbert Harbour Trustees has been made for long-term funding
support to ensure the provision of proper berthing facilities for the
Caledonian MacBrayne ferry.
Last year, winter services had to be abandoned after no suitable
overnight berthing arrangements could be made available at Tarbert.
CalMac, who introduced the summer service as an experiment, says it
proved one of the most popular routes in the west of Scotland, exceeding
all forecasts for passengers and cars.
Links from Tarbert to Arran were also planned but had to be dropped.
In a letter to Argyll and Bute District Council's planning committee,
Mr Ian MacIntyre, chairman of the trustees, said that to enable these
important links to be established on a permanent basis, his group was
seeking a package of funding and requested the council to assist the
project.
In a report to the district council planning committee, Mr George
Harper, director of planning, development, and tourism, said he believed
the investment would prove worthwhile.
He said: ''The operation of an all-year round service has considerable
positive implications for the economy of the area.
''Argyll and the Islands Enterprise have already contributed
substantial amounts to the introduction of this project last year and
are unlikely to be able to allocate any further amounts.''
Plans include the building of an extension, although it will not be
connected, to the existing pier at Tarbert where a new, larger roll-on
roll-off ferry is being introduced to cope with demand.
Argyll and Bute councillors say they wish to ensure that additional
support funding comes from the Scottish Office Industry Development
Department, Cunninghame District Council, and Strathclyde Passenger
Transport Executive.
Councillors have agreed in principle to provide a total of #123,000 to
cover the years 1996-98.

FORGET the image of the holiday battleaxes. Scot Aileen Platt has been
voted best bed and breakfast landlady in the whole of Britain . . . and
it's all done with kindness.
Mother of three Mrs Platt, 57, started up the three-bedroom business
at her home in Abbotsford Road, Galashiels, when the last of her
children left home 11 years ago.
Since then she has been such a hit with her #16-a-night visitors that
they have twice voted her Scottish champion and have now crowned it this
year with the UK national title.
The award, presented by Scottish Tourist Board chairman Ian Grant, is
based on customer satisfaction forms returned by thousands of visitors
from 32 nations who have stayed at 2000 B&amp;B businesses around Britain.
Mrs Platt treats her visitors to her own version of the Big Breakfast
show from her spacious kitchen . . . sausages, eggs, bacon, kippers, and
all the trimmings. There is even haggis if they want it: ''Some foreign
visitors are a bit doubtful about the haggis but when they taste it most
say they are surprised how good it is.''
The other big secret of her success is the personal touch. She and her
maths teacher husband, John, spend a lot of time talking to their
visitors.
Mrs PLatt says: ''We really do try to treat them as members of the
family. We try to help them make the most of the beautiful Border
country. We have had Russians, Americans, Japanese . . . all
nationalities. Even when they speak very little English we seem to get
by.''

MEASLES, once a major illness of childhood, may be close to
elimination in the UK, with the last confirmed case affecting a child
two months ago.
The Government's chief medical officer, Dr Kenneth Calman, said the
biggest nationwide vaccination campaign, begun last November, was ''an
incredible success''. The last confirmed case among children was on
February 24.
''The impact of the campaign has been dramatic,'' Dr Calman told a
London news conference. ''Since January 1, there has been only one
confirmed case of measles in children covered by the campaign, and that
child's parents had withheld consent for immunisation. In all, there
have been only 21 confirmed cases of measles in 1995.''
The Government had acted to prevent an anticipated epidemic that could
have caused up to 200,000 measles cases and 50 deaths. Seven million
children aged five to 16 were targeted. National coverage was 92% and
more than three-quarters of health districts had coverage of 90% or
more.
The Government's announcement comes as evidence of a possible link
between measles vaccination and Crohn's disease is expected to be
published this week in a leading medical journal.
Crohn's disease is a rare form of inflammatory bowel disease that
occurs in about 10 people per 100,000 of the population each year,
causing abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and weight loss.
Dr Calman dismissed reports of a risk factor for Crohn's disease and
refused to discuss the report.

THE days of the National Mod being staged in such unlikely venues as
Airdrie, East Kilbride, or Motherwell appear to be over.
Yesterday in Inverness, the Ard Comhairle, or management committee, of
An Comunn Gaidhealach unanimously adopted a 60-page consultant's report
which laid down a development strategy for the next five years.
An Comunn chief executive, Mr Donald John MacSween, said afterwards
that the report had recommended a core circuit of four Mod venues: Oban,
Glasgow, Perth, and Inverness. There would also be a reserve list
including Portree and Stornoway, which would come into play when
particularly strong bids were made.
He said: ''What we are doing is recognising that the Mod works in
certain places and not in others. It is silly, quite frankly, for
Scotland's third largest festival to be shifted around in the sometimes
vague hope that everything will work out.''
It was also proposed that An Comunn's national leadership takes over
the management of the National Mod, which costs around #130,000 to
stage. While local Mod committees would still have a role to play,
responsibility for securing funding would lie with the national body.
Mr MacSween insisted that the proposed changes had nothing to do with
the financial difficulties associated with the Airdrie Mod in 1993.
The Herald understands the report, which will remain unpublished until
the membership has seen it, recommends the appointment of a Mod
promotions manager. Mr MacSween refused to confirm this, or that another
major festival, Feis Alba, was also being recommended.
The report, prepared by Inverness-based consultants Compass, will now
go before An Comunn's annual general meeting in Inverness, in June. If
accepted, the Mod circuit would come into operation after Golspie this
year, Blairgowrie in 1996, and Inverness in 1997.

Kigali, Wednesday
RWANDA'S Vice-President and military chief Major-General Paul Kagame
flatly rejected demands today for free passage to neighbouring Zaire by
1000 Hutus trapped in a camp where thousands were massacred.
Kagame, breaking his silence over the weekend slaughter, told Reuters
in an interview he would not, however, take military action against
them.
''Free passage is absolutely nonsense. The government will find other
ways of resolving the problem,'' said the 38-year-old general who led
Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated army to victory against the Hutu majority last
year.
Asked if these included military measures against those in the camp,
mostly women and children, Kagame said force was out of the question.
''I don't see any military action against them. That is out. We are
carefully weighing other options,'' he added without elaborating.
The Hutus are the remnants of up to 80,000 residents at the camp where
UN officials say thousands were killed by Kagame's troops and in
stampedes on Saturday.
Those remaining, including hardliners who supported last year's
massacres, are demanding free passage to neighbouring Zaire. Also in the
camp are women and children desperately short of food and water.
UN officials fear the women and children are being held as human
shields by young men who expect to be arrested or killed if they
surrender.
Kagame reiterated his government's stand that most of the Hutus at
Kibeho camp were well-armed criminal elements trying to escape justice.
''It is reasonable to believe that there are arms in the Kibeho
camp,'' he added.
UN officials and aid workers said Kagame's stand ended any hope the
Hutus had of joining hundreds of thousands of their tribesmen now living
in sprawling refugee camps in east Zaire.
They fled Rwanda last year after the assasination of Hutu military
strongman Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6 sparked genocidal killings of
between 500,000 and a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
Kagame's made his remarks after US Assistant Secretary of State George
Moose, the top American African specialist, told a news conference in
Kigalia today that he had advised Rwandan officials that whatever they
did at Kibeho camp should be without bloodshed.
UN peacekeepers said earlier a government announcement on the siege of
Kibeho in southwestern Rwanda by Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Army
(RPA) troops was expected but they did not know what would be said.
They told Reuters by phone from Kibeho that mediation efforts by the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had broken down and ICRC
officials had left the camp after failing to broker an agreement between
the two sides.
Moose, who flew to the region after reports of the massacre, whose
extent the Rwandan government has denied, said he had urged the
government to work with the UN to find a political solution to the siege
now in a fourth day. He said Washington had no immediate plan to cut off
aid over the carnage.
Kagame said he had ordered investigations into the Kibeho incident and
promised any soldier found guilty of acting with excessive force would
be punnished.

clashes with Hutu gunmen in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, an army
spokesman said today.--Reuter.

Alkmaar, Wednesday
A DUTCH court ruled today that a doctor had taken justifiable action
in ending the life of a severely handicapped baby girl in 1993.
The Alkmaar district court found Dr Henk Prins formally guilty of
murder but decided not to punish him for the offence which carries a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Explaining the verdict, Judge Ben Posch, said Prins, 49, had faced a
difficult choice between two irreconcilable duties -- preserving the
child's life or ending her suffering.
''The court concludes . . . that the defendant made a choice which --
given the special circumstances of the case -- can reasonably be
considered as justifiable,'' he said.
Prins gave a fatal injection to the baby in consultation with her
parents and other doctors after she was born with a partly formed brain
and spina bifida in March 1993.
The doctors Prins consulted agreed that the child, called Rianne, was
in great pain, had only weeks to live and that her condition could not
be improved by operating on her.
She died in her mother's arms with her father at her side after Prins
gave her an injection of muscle relaxant which stopped her heart and
lungs working.
The case was an important test of Dutch mercy-killing law because
Prins is the first doctor to be prosecuted for ending the life of a
patient who was unable to express her own will.
Euthanasia, though formally illegal, is permitted in The Netherlands,
but hitherto only when patients have explicitly asked a doctor to end
their life.
Ending the life of a patient unable to make such a request has been a
grey area under Dutch law and, in comments after the verdict, the judge
urged the government to rectify this.
Posch said that in the court's view it was permissible for doctors to
end the life of newborn babies as long as certain strict conditions were
fulfilled.
The child must be in unbearable pain which cannot be alleviated by
medical care and the parents must make an explicit and repeated request
for the child's life to be ended.
Legal sources said the criteria set out by the court were very similar
to those which Dutch courts have accepted in cases where patients had
asked for euthanasia.
After reading out the verdict, the judge praised Prins for his
integrity and courage and wished him well for any further legal
proceedings he may face.
Experts said the Prins case could turn into a lengthy legal battle all
the way up to the Supreme Court as the public prosecutor might appeal
against the district court's verdict.
''I am relieved and I feel that justice has been done to me,'' he told
reporters.
At his trial on April 12 he said that ending baby Rianne's life had
left him ''emotionally scarred'' but that he was in no doubt that his
action had been correct.--Reuter.

POLICE have raided the headquarters of FCB Enterprise Security Ltd in
Paisley after a string of allegations concerning its operations.
Strathclyde Police said officers had raided the company's office in
Ferguslie Park and seized a number of files. They said the documents had
been taken away for further investigation.
The security company found itself under the spotlight after the
Paisley North MP, Mrs Irene Adams, claimed that it was being used as a
front for illegal activities.
Mrs Adams tabled 14 parliamentary questions last week, demanding
answers over FCB Security's operations. She called on Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang to answer questions about the supervision of the company, its
holdings company, and its external auditors.
FCB Security has denied strenuously all the allegations. It was set up
with #193,000 of public money and is part of a #47m project to
revitalise Ferguslie Park. It is the largest employer in the area and is
part of Ferguslie Park Community Holdings, one of Scotland's oldest
community businesses.
In a separate matter, two men have appeared in custody at Paisley
Sheriff Court after an intensive police operation, codenamed Dragon, in
the town.
Officers have made other arrests, and three more accused are also
expected to appear on petition at the same court today.
The pair who were detained in custody for further inquiries yesterday
-- Mr George Docherty, 35, and Mr Robert Pickett, 30 -- face a number of
charges involving intimidation and the use of threatening behaviour.
They are alleged to have conspired with three others in the premises
of FCB Security Ltd, McKenzie Street, Paisley, between December 21,
1994, and January 15 this year to threaten, menace, intimidate, and
assault Mr David Bremner, 27, and Mr George Weir, 22, whose addresses
were given as c/o police, and place them in a state of fear and alarm
for their safety.
Both, it is claimed, menaced Mr Bremner by placing themselves outside
his home equipped with a firearm on January 7, while acting along with
others, and menaced Mr Weir by placing themselves outside his home along
with others on January 15.
The pair are additionally charged with placing both men in such a
state of fear and apprehension for their safety, and the safety of their
families, that they fled from Paisley on January 17.
Mr Pickett faces further charges of recklessly driving a motor vehicle
in Ferguslie Park Avenue on April 18 towards another vehicle occupied by
Mr James Duffin, Ms Andrea McLaughlin, and Anton McLaughlin, aged 20
months, and forcing the vehicle to swerve to avoid a collision, to the
danger of all three occupants; and obstructing the carriageway on the
same date in nearby Dalskeith Road, while acting along with another, and
placing Ms McLaughlin and Mr Duffin in a state of fear and alarm.
Defence agent Mr Gordon Ritchie, who represented Mr Pickett, said that
neither accused had made any declaration during their appearance on
petition before Sheriff Ronald Smith.
Each was remanded in custody for further examination.

Tokyo, Wednesday
THE arrest today of two members of the elite ''chemical squad'' of a
Japanese doomsday religious cult marks a breakthrough in investigations
of the gas attacks on Tokyo's subway system, Japanese media reported.
Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth) sect chemist Masami Tsuchiya and
Seiichi Endo, identified as Aum's ''health minister,'' were arrested
along with five other sect members on suspicion of confining cult
members and harbouring a fugitive, police said.
Kyodo News Agency said the arrest of Tsuchiya, 30, sheds new light on
the cult's chemical activities, including the production of deadly
substances.
The police inquiry into the cult's chemical projects suffered a
setback on Monday with the stabbing death of AUM's chief scientist Hideo
Murai.
Police suspect Tsuchiya, like Murai, played a key role in the
production of the nerve gas sarin, used in the Tokyo subway attack,
Kyodo reported, citing ''police sources.''
Media reports described Tsuchiya as a brilliant scientist who quit a
five-year chemistry doctoral programme at one of Japan's premier science
schools to join the cult.
The arrest of gene engineering expert Endo, 34, also gave police new
insight into Aum's activities in biological research, including germ
warfare studies, Kyodo reported.
Endo had developed a variety of drugs and chemicals and in 1993
reportedly purchased materials necessary for multiplying viruses, Kyodo
reported.
Tsuchiya and Endo had written chemical weapons such as sarin as well
as biological weapons would be used in the next world war.--Reuter.

Frankfurt, Wednesday
THE German Foreign Ministry said Singapore officials today handed over
a formal extradition request for former Barings Bank trader Nick Leeson,
blamed with causing the collapse of the venerable British bank.
The decision to hand over the request today came ahead of a deadline
set for next Tuesday -- exactly two months after the 28-year-old Briton
was detained at Frankfurt airport following his arrival on a flight from
Brunei.
Leeson has been blamed with losing more than $1000m in risky Japanse
stock futures deals at the 233-year-old bank, which has since been
bought by ING of the Netherlands.
German authorities have said they expect a lengthy court battle,
possibly lasting until autumn, as Leeson seeks to block the request on
human rights grounds.
Leeson's German lawyer, Eberhard Kempf, declined to comment on how he
will specifically fight the request.
The ministry spokeswoman said the formal request would not be released
by the government, but Kempf said he may decide to inform the media
about its content after speaking with Leeson.
Leeson had been hoping for a rival extradition request from Britain,
where Barings is based, so that he would not be returned to Singapore,
known for its tough legal system.
His lawyers have talked of Leeson's willingness to cooperate with a
British investigation into Barings in order to be returned to London.
But Britain's Serious Fraud Office, which is leading an inquiry into
the collapse of the bank, repeated earlier statements today that it was
not interested in seeking Leeson with a rival extradition bid.--Reuter.

Kuala Lumpur, Wednesday
PRIME minister Mahathir Mohamad today basked in the greatest election
victory in Malaysian history, widely seen as a mandate for his vision of
turning Malaysia into a fully developed country in 25 years.
Mahathir's multi-racial National Front took 162 of 192 seats in
parliament and won 10 of the 11 state assembly contests in nationwide
polls this week.
The already fragmented opposition was shattered, winning just 29
seats, with one contest in the north Borneo state of Sabah to be
announced later.
It was the biggest victory since independence from Britain in 1957.
The fundamentalist All-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS by its initials in
Malay) took some of the shine off the victory by retaining power in the
northern state of Kelantan.
PAS advocates an Islamic administration in Malaysia featuring Sharia
laws that prescribe death by stoning for adulterers and limb amputation
for convicted thieves.--Reuter.

The nuclear industry says it now has a clearer idea of the
decommissioning costs for old power stations, and they are not as high
as once feared. But environmentalists say we are forcing future
generations to pick up the final tab for our mess. Kirsty Scott reports
WHEN it comes to the decommissioning of Britain's older generation of
nuclear power plants, environmentalists say there can be no credible
predictions about the final price tag, or indeed the outcome of the
process.
No commercially-sized nuclear power station has been completely
decommissioned, and campaigners say we are staring into the unknown,
leaving future generations to pick up the bill -- and the pieces, if our
current processes turn out to be less effective than we'd hoped.
With the nuclear industry in the spotlight over the Government's
merger/privatisation plans and the waste-management review, it's hoped a
clearer idea will emerge about how nuclear plant decommissioning and
waste will be handled and financed.
''The actual financing of decommissioning is a grey area at best,''
said Graham Stein, energy spokesman for Friends of the Earth Scotland.
''It's a bit like the restaurant at the end of the universe. Actual
decommissioning proper won't happen for at least 100 years. The thinking
is if we put enough money in the bank now, it will be worth lots more in
100 years.
''No commercially-sized nuclear power station has been decommissioned,
so no-one knows what it will cost. You can't say money has been set
aside to do it. What happens if you have not put enough money aside? The
taxpayer will pick up the tab for any liabilities for the nuclear
industry.''
In Scotland, Scottish Nuclear have been decommissioning the Magnox
Hunterston A plant since it was withdrawn from the National Grid in
1990.
Where Nuclear Electric have an 11% levy on electricity bills to pay
for decommissioning in England and Wales, Scottish Nuclear have a price
structure arrangement with their clients ScottishPower and Hydro
Electric which brings in the cash needed for decommissioning work. Like
the levy, the premium element in Scottish Nuclear's pricing is due to be
phased out by 1998.
Scottish Nuclear spokesman Mark Whittet said the cost was 0.2p per
unit of electricty for Hunterston A. The total cost for decommissioning
the plant has been put at #399m under the current strategy and #270m
under the Safestore programme, which is still part of the Government
review.
Mr Whittet said it was misleading to suggest that decommissioning
costs could never be properly computed.
''Over the five years that we have been doing decommissioning work on
Hunterston A, costs have become known . . . and the decommissioning work
has actually cost less than originally had been anticipated. It's been
done ahead of time and ahead of budget.''
The first phase of decommissioning work at Hunterston A -- the
de-fuelling, which takes with it 99.9% of the radioactivity -- was
completed at the end of last year.
Graham Stein said it was difficult to criticise the nature of
decommissioning because no-one knew, ultimately, what it would involve.
''They built these things without any regard for how they were going
to be decommissioned, without any idea of what it's going to cost future
generations. Nuclear waste remains dangerous for 240,000 years. The
Government has still not come up with an answer.''
In England and Wales, Nuclear Electric are carrying out
decommissioning work on two Magnox stations: Berkeley in Gloucestershire
and Trawsfynydd in the Snowdonia National Park in Wales.
Asked how much decommissioning cost, Bob Fenton, a spokesman for
Nuclear Electric, said: ''That's the $64,000 question, isn't it?''
Mr Fenton said NE had projected a #10.5bn cost for decommissioning by
1998. ''The levy would have raised about #9.1bn if it continued to that
point and #1.4bn would be funded by the company.''
Confusion over what might happen to the levy in the Government's
shake-up of the industry left the question of who would foot the cost of
decommissioning.
''John Major said yesterday they may be phasing the levy out early. I
don't know quite how they will then raise the money,'' said Mr Fenton.
''That's a question you will have to ask the Government. Someone,
somewhere will be left with a fairly large bill.''
Graham Stein said some of the possibilities being explored included
the setting up of a holding company which would get money set aside for
decommissioning to take on the ageing first-generation Magnox stations
when they close.
Mr Fenton said at Trawsfynydd they had opted for a reduced-height safe
store to encase the plant. With the fuel removed, all the buildings with
no connection to the nuclear process, such as administration blocks,
will be stripped out and the reactor hall itself will be reduced in
height by some 60 feet and will then be covered with a concrete shroud.
''It will not be demolished for 135 years,'' said Mr Fenton. ''During
that time someone will have to be responsible for care and maintenance
to try to make sure there's no-one silly enough to try to get inside.''

Cairo, Wednesday,
ISRAEL'S negotiator to talks with the PLO on long-delayed Palestinian
elections said today the two sides could beat a July 1 deadline set for
agreement on the polls, which are already nine months behind schedule.
Yoel Singer told Reuters that negotiators had drafted about half of
the agreement that would allow residents of the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank to vote for a Palestinian council as agreed in a 1993 peace deal.
Under the 1993 accord, the interim agreement covers the transfer of
self-rule authority to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
before talks on final status begin.
Singer's Palestinian counterpart, Saeb Erekat, shared his optimism but

United Nations, Wednesday
BRITAIN believes the number of states in favour of an indefinite
extension for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is so large there may be
a consensus rather than a vote on this crucial issue.
Asked if the requisite 90 votes existed to make the treaty permanent,
Britain's chief arms-control negotiatior, Sir Michael Weston, said
today: ''I think everyone agrees that there is, including some who don't
like it.
''One is talking of upward of 100 countries in favour of an indefinite
extension,'' he told reporters, adding that an informal count by the UN
secretariat put the figure as high as 130.
Weston, ambassador to the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, said he
thought no more than 15 countries were firm in their opposition to
making the treaty permanent.--Reuter.

Anne Johnstone examines the implications -- and possible
disappointments -- of buying a home through an endowment policy
LATE in 1986 I took out a #30,000 mortgage, an endowment mortgage.
From memory home loans were a bit tight at the time, so it was an
immense relief when the salesmen told me and my husband that the
building society was prepared to lend to us.
We then smiled and nodded obediently as he went on to explain that an
endowment type mortgage would be ''ideal''. It never occured to us that
it might be ideal for him, on account of all the lovely commission he
would make, but could be an expensive decision for us.
Should we have taken a straight repayment mortgage? Did we make a huge
mistake?
Tomorrow the Office of Fair Trading issues its report on endowment
mortgages. Insiders say it won't contain the fierce criticism many were
expecting but it will raise important questions about how they are sold
and how they operate.
It coincides with a more outspoken report from actuary AKG, claiming
endowments are no longer a ''safe'' way of buying a home. And it follows
warnings from life companies that disappointing returns on their
investments could mean that endowments don't produce enough on maturity
to pay off the amount borrowed, never mind about a tax-free nest egg on
top.
This seems especially cruel when endowments are sold largely on the
basis of a fat-sounding lump sum at the end of it all. As many as
100,000 homeowners, mainly those with 10 or 15-year endowments taken out
in the past six years, face a shortfall.
But what of the rest of us? Around eight million people in Britain
hold endowment mortgages. In 1988, they accounted for 83% of homeowners
and even now a majority of all new home-loans are endowments.
''I think everybody should have a capital and interest mortgage. It's
crazy that on the same day as you take on the biggest debt of your life,
you should be talked into investing money,'' says leading Scots
independent financial adviser Alan Steel. He says customers tend to be
dazzled by the prospect of a lump sum without realising that in 25 years
inflation will have whittled it down to a fraction of today's value.
Rob Thomas, mortgage analyst with stockbrokers UBS, says: ''Endowments
are particularly inappropriate in a world with low inflation and high
interest rates. Under those circumstances borrowers should be paying off
debt rather than investing.'' First-time buyers, he says, should take
out repayment mortgages unless they are planning to make lots of moves.
(One recognised benefit of endowments is their portability.)
The group of endowment holders with most to lose are those who decide
to cash in their policies early, the main area covered in tomorrow's OFT
report. It is estimated that less than one third of endowments make it
to the end of their term.
AKG reckons that between 1989 and 1992, 500,000 borrowers lost about
#250m by cashing in their endowments early because they had fallen into
arrears. Many found they got less back than they put in. If they had
chosen repayment mortgages, they would have paid off part of the debt.
So why do banks and building societies continue to plug endowments?
When I contacted the Halifax, Britain's biggest lender, they faxed me a
single sheet entitled Disadvantages of Repayment Mortgages. Are banks
and building societies keen to sell endowments because of the large
commissions paid by the life companies? Such commissions account for
more than 10% of the profits of the Halifax and much more for smaller
societies.
Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine, found that most lenders
recommended endowments regardless of whether they suited the clients'
needs. They concluded that this was because of the commission received
for selling endowments. On a #50-a-month endowment this would be about
#360. (Advisers don't get any commission on repayment mortgages they
sell).
Should those with endowments switch to repayment mortgages? That
depends on judgments about the future of the economy and also on the
terms of individual policies. In general, early surrender is rarely
advised because of the financial penalties incurred.
If I had opted for a repayment mortgage in 1986, by next year I would
have paid off around #4400. Five years later, assuming the same interest
rate, #9800 would be paid and five years after that #17,900 would have
been cut from the debt. Instead, I still owe the #30,000. If I cashed it
in today I would receive just #4819, which is my original stake plus
#244.
Meanwhile, the reversionary bonus has fallen from 5.1% to 3%. On
current projections my policy will generate enough income to cover my
debt, but by the year 2011 that dreamed-of nest egg may have shrunk to
some loose change.
Borrowing pitfalls
Repayment mortgage
YOUR monthly repayment consists of two parts: you pay off the capital
(slowly at first) and the rest goes to cover the interest on the
outstanding debt. Disadvantages:
* No tax-free lump sum at the end of the repayment term.
* Because there is no built-in life insurance, if the borrower dies,
his relatives could be liable for the outstanding debt. (In practice,
lenders insist that borrowers take out basic life cover or mortgage
protection insurance to deal with this eventuality).
* Debt does not reduce very much at first because interest payments
are loaded on during the early years. So if you keep moving and taking
out 25-year repayment mortgages, you won't be able to reduce your debt
to any extent.
* Provided interest rates are lower than about 9%, repayments are
higher than for endowments.
Endowment mortgage
YOU pay only the interest on the loan, together with premiums for an
investment-based life insurance policy which matures at the end of the
mortgage. This sum is intended to pay off the loan and you get to keep
any surplus. Disadvantages:
* The maturity value is not guaranteed to cover the sum borrowed.
* Traditional endowments are rather inflexible. Whereas repayment
mortgages can be changed, lengthening the repayment term or reducing
premiums temporarily, if you fall on hard times, it's harder to do this
with endowments. (New index-linked endowments offer more flexibility.)
* Because the sum borrowed does not diminish over the borrowing
period, you can't use an endowment mortgage to work your way out of a
negative equity situation.
* Payments are more expensive if interest rates are higher than about
9%.

FRENCH presidential favourite Jacques Chirac delivered a stinging snub
to fellow Gaullist Prime Minister Edouard Balladur today by rejecting
conditions for reconciling with his defeated rival.
Smarting from the humiliation, Balladur, who was edged out of the
presidential race in Sunday's first round of voting, left the capital
for an Alpine holiday.
Aides said he would not return until after May Day, less than a week
before Chirac faces Socialist Lionel Jospin in a May 7 election run-off.
Chirac, leading Jospin with 55% of the vote to 45% for Jospin in a new
opinion poll by the BVA polling institute, had offered to meet Balladur
for a reconciliation lunch to end their bruising duel.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Major blamed for 'soul-less' housing he now condemns</HEADLINE>

THE Prime Minister yesterday condemned soul-less inner city ''ghetto
estates'' and soul-less tower blocks -- only to be revealed as the local
politician behind two notorious housing schemes in south London.
Mr Major branded decaying inner cities as ''monuments to the failed
history of socialist planning''.
However, his pledge to make them better places to live backfired when
Labour gleefully uncovered his track record as chairman of Lambeth
housing committee in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
As housing chairman in Lambeth, he approved the building of the two
now notorious estates -- and urged the borough to send council officials
to Poland to study socialist housing programmes.
Mr Major promised to work with private companies and local councils of
all parties to tackle the high-rise blocks and barren estates that
wrecked communities and robbed them of ambition and self-respect.
''Many were built as solutions to inner city problems. Ironically,
they have now become major contributors to the problem,'' he said in a
speech to the Social Market Foundation in London.
''There they stand, grey, sullen, concrete wastelands, set apart from
the rest of the community, robbing people of ambition and self-respect.
''Monuments to the failure of socialist planning -- too many lives
have been wrecked by growing up in such demoralising surroundings.''
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson accused the Prime Minister
of hypocrisy and double standards.
He said Labour research showed that:
* In 1969 and 1970, Lambeth Tories gave the go-ahead to the Stockwell
Park estate and the ''Barrier Block'' in Brixton, which have cost
millions of pounds to keep habitable.
* In April 1971, Mr Major recommended ''as a matter of urgency'' an
expenses paid trip to Poland by council officials to study socialist
planning.
* In December 1970, he attacked tenants for not consulting the council
before painting stonework around their doors and told them to remove it.
* In 1969 Tory councillors envisaged a ''space age Brixton'' of
30-storey tower blocks, eight-story terraces, motorways and walkways.
Mr Dobson said the findings undermined the Prime Minister's claim to
be concerned about inner-city decay.
''This is the real John Major -- say one thing, do another, never
practise what you preach. No wonder the British people so rightly hold
him and his Government in complete contempt,'' he said.
The Labour attack clearly infuriated Conservative Central Office and
provoked new accusations of below-the-belt politics in the run-up to the
English local council elections next week.
Central Office said Mr Major was not attacking the motives of the
people who built the tower blocks, which were put up with the best
intentions. He was emphasising the need to learn from past mistakes and
improve conditions in the inner cities.
The row completely overshadowed an attempt by the Prime Minister to
put inner city policy higher up the political agenda.
Mr Major said the Government was determined to build on self-help
style schemes where councils work with local people and the private
sector to regenerate decaying areas and ''humanise'' estates.
He pledged to work for higher standards in schools and heralded a new
scheme in which individual schools would be encouraged to set their own
performance standards based on the Parent's Charter.
The Prime Minister, who later toured a north London estate under
improvement, drew heavily on his own experiences as a young man in
Brixton.
''In the 1950s and 1960s I saw terraces not far from where I lived
demolished. Communities, albeit poor, were rehoused in tower blocks that
were modern, clean, sanitary, spacious, but also soul-less,'' he said.
''The best of intentions produced the worst of results. The housing
was better, but the community was lost.
''When I spoke about a classless society, it was people like that I
had in mind. They deserve opportunity and choice. They do not deserve to
be patronised and disregarded.''
Mr Major outlined plans at the beginning of the month for a housing
White Paper aimed at giving fresh impetus to the Government's social
programme.
The document, to be published in the next couple of months, will look
at ways of extending home ownership, increasing tenants' rights to buy
their homes and stimulating private sector involvement in urban
regeneration.

Next week is the first Scottish Liver Awareness Week. Ann Shaw reports
on a national disaster area
MARY K attended Gartnavel Hospital in Glasgow. She was told at first
that she had ME then, after some tests, that she had a liver disease and
nothing could be done.
She was sent home without even so much as a leaflet to tell her that
support groups existed for people with her condition.
Then she read in The Herald's about Collette Thain, who had been
successfully treated for a rare liver disease by an Edinburgh- based
Chinese doctor.
She contacted Thain, got the name of a local support group, learnt
about the specialist Liver Unit -- the only one of its kind in Scotland,
based at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary -- and got a referral.
''Its women like this we want to reach,'' says Thain. ''From next
week, every hospital in Scotland will have leaflets informing them of
the existence of the Liver Support Group. Too often, women who go to
their doctors with fatigue are dismissed and not taken seriously.
Unfortunately, if you are feeling ill, the last thing you want to do is
to take on the medical establishment.''
Yet every year, over 7500 people in the UK die from liver diseases
such as hepatitis, liver cancer and cirrhosis. The liver is one of the
most vital, if not the most important, organ in the body, fighting off
infections, making essential chemicals and filtering out poisons.
While enormous progress has been made in recent years, with liver
transplants and a better understanding of treating people with liver
disease, there remains a surprising amount of ignorance, both among the
medical profession and the lay public, of exactly what kind of treatment
and help is available.
The British Liver Trust recently surveyed GPs to find out how much
they knew about hepatitis. The results were worrying: 74% of doctors did
not know there was a treatment for hepatitis C, and 93% of doctors who
had seen patients with hepatitis B had not thought a further referral to
a specialist necessary.
Thain, Scottish co-ordinator of the Liver Support Group says:
''There's a bone-crushing isolation when you're told you've got a rare
and incurable disease.
''We want to get the message across that those with liver disease have
an automatic right to be referred to the Liver Unit at Edinburgh's Royal
Infirmary for specialist investigation, and that there is a network of
support groups and information available. Many hospitals are not
bothering to refer patients.
''When I was first told by my doctor I had a liver disease (primary
biliary cirrhosis) I didn't know where to turn for help and felt that
everyone assumed I was an alcoholic. Now, with our support groups, there
is no longer a reason for anyone to feel like I did.''
The good news, though, is that liver transplants are saving hundreds
of lives each year. More than 500 take place annually in the eight
specialised units in the UK, including Edinburgh.
* For further information, contact Collette Thain, Scottish
Co-ordinator, Liver Support Group. Phone 01875 853 552. Factsheets about
specific liver diseases are available (enclose sae) from the British
Liver Trust, Central House, Central Avenue, Ransomes Europark, Ipswich
IP3 9QG. Phone 01473 276326.
EVENTS
Among the events lined up for next week are:
* Distribution of leaflets to hospitals informing them of the Liver
Support Group and British Liver Trust.
* Rock concert at The Venue, Edinburgh on Wednesday, May 3. Tickets
available from Virgin Megastore, Princes Street, Edinburgh.
* Handing out donor registration forms in Edinburgh from May 4-6.
* Spring Charity Ball in aid of the British Liver Trust at Greencraigs
hotel, Aberlady, May 6.

RETIRED Edinburgh nurse Kate Milne had a bizarre, Kafka-like
experience: a week of her life went missing.
Then she woke up to find herself in hospital surrounded by people
speaking with a strange accent.
She remembers pulling an oxygen mask off her face demanding to
know:''Where am I?''
''You are in Birmingham,'' came the reply. ''You've had a liver
transplant.''
Yet it all started innocently enough: a golfing holiday in Spain, a
''tummy bug'' on return, more seriously, hepatitis diagnosed a week
later, followed by an emergency admission to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary
with severe abdominal pain.
''I remember nothing,'' says Kate. ''I went into a coma. They flew me
to the Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham for a liver transplant. I
was lucky. There was one available.''
That was five years ago, before Scotland's first liver transplant unit
opened in Edinburgh.
Today, Kate says she has never felt fitter. Within two months of her
transplant, Kate (handicap 13) was back playing golf. Three days later,
she scored a hole in one.
Had she any inkling she had picked up a virus?
''None at all,'' she explained. ''I had had several foreign holidays
that year. It may not have been Spain.''
She is full of praise for the treatment she received, and for her
family, too.
0 And she is grateful to the person whose liver she has. ''Without it,
I would be dead. That operation cost #32,000, yet it's free on the
NHS.''
Today, Kate leads a perfectly normal life, playing golf every day and
taking part in the annual Transplant Games.
Oh yes, there's a bonus. Since the transplant her rheumatics have
disappeared.
Now Kate makes a special plea: ''Please carry a donor card. I think we
should have a system whereby you have to sign a card to say you want to
opt out, otherwise your organs will be used for transplant.''
* Donor cards are available from: 0800 555 777.

THE director of Railtrack Scotland told The Herald yesterday that the
future of the Forth Rail Bridge was secure.
Dr Paul Prescott, speaking after a rail freight conference in Glasgow,
also promised to try to improve the services available across the
bridge.
He said he was hoping to raise maximum speed and weight limits
currently imposed on cross-bridge traffic and he added: ''I hope we will
be able to increase traffic on the bridge in the future.''
The bridge should be able to compete more effectively with roads, he
added.
His comments came after a presentation during which Dr Prescott said
he had been ''very keen'' to keep in the Railtrack portfolio an unused
line from Stirling to Longannet. He said it could be re-opened and used
to carry freight, and possibly passengers, to and from Fife in the
future.
However, he said -- in a light-hearted tone -- that this should not be
interpreted as a conspiracy to close the Forth Rail Bridge.
He continued: ''That couldn't be further from the truth. We are
looking at lifting or easing restrictions and I hope to say something
about that later this year.''
At present, the rail bridge limits do not allow full-length coal
trains and 8ft 6in containers. The bridge currently carries up to 200
passenger and freight trains a day.
Despite claims that the rail bridge is crumbling, Railtrack has
insisted it is only superficially damaged.
Earlier this week, The Herald reported that the bridge was due to be
given a facelift in the near future. Critics said that would not ensure
safety of the structure in the long term.

THE Commons yesterday turned to the perennially knotty problem of
''who guards the guards?'' or, in this case, ''who investigates the
investigators?''
Confronted with an alarming, and expensive, run of cases in which
miscarriages of justice were discovered and incarcerated persons
released with apologies and large amounts of money, the Government has
decided to set up a Criminal Cases Review Commission for all parts of
the UK but Scotland, to supervise future inquiries into similar
allegations.
So far, one might think, so good. The austere figure of Mr Chris
Mullin (Sunderland South -- Lab., champion of the Birmingham Six, author
of A Very British Coup and not the toast of most police section houses,
rose to propose that the commission should be able to appoint its own
investigating officers.
For, although the commission supervises, the old system remains
whereby the chief constable of the force to be investigated retains the
right in serious cases, where internal investigation is not good enough,
to nominate an officer from another force to carry out the inquiry. On
this amendment, battle was joined.
In debating terms, it was an unequal struggle. Mr Mullin put his case
in moderate terms. Mr Alan Beith, the perfectly sensible Liberal
Democrat spokesman, said it was a ''perfectly sensible idea.''
Two Tories said it sounded quite reasonable. One of them, the recently
reconciled Euro-rebel Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills) appealed
to ''my own Front Bench, as I am now allowed to call them again,'' to
consider accepting the Mullin amendment.
Mr David Trimble (Upper Bann -- Ulster Unionist) said such a power
should only be used in ''the most exceptional circumstances'', but, as
he spoke on, admitted he seemed to be moving into the ranks of Mr
Mullin's supporters.
The respect paid to the Ulster Unionists (and their nine votes) as the
Government steadily declines is marked.
Both Labour and Tory MPs addressed Mr Trimble as their ''Honourable
Friend'', a term normally kept only for your own side. Others get the
polite but chillier Honourable Gentleman or Lady.
Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw remarked that, as only larger forces
have the manpower to conduct such investigations, one found a North
Yorkshire taskforce investigating a complaint against West Midlands
while West Midlands was investigating a complaint against North
Yorkshire.
In the Old Met, Mr Straw reminisced from his time as a barrister, they
started off fitting up crooks who might not have been guilty as charged
but who certainly had unresolved crimes to their name. The power ''went
to their heads'', he said, ''and they started fitting up entirely
innocent people''. The habit had spread and there was now not much
public confidence in one police officer investigating another.
Mr Mullin, whose studious demeanour, bald dome and thin-rimmed
spectacles, belie a flair for the dramatic, intervened to disclose that
an RUC deputy chief constable had told him that the North Yorkshire
force had framed a defendant in a celebrated case but nonetheless had
been nominated to investigate a complaint against his own force.
Mr Straw's deputy, Mr Alun Michael, won a duel with Home Office
Minister David Maclean, who argued if the commission disliked the
officer chosen by the chief constable it could veto him.
This was so, agreed Mr Michael, but the Criminal Appeal Bill made
clear that the chief constable could go on choosing officers from the
same force.
Mr Maclean appeared backed into a corner. The amendment seemed
reasonable. Everyone who had spoken, apart from him, favoured it and he
rehearsed unconvincingly a brief which sounded as if it had been drawn
up by Sir Humphrey on a bad day.
Then he produced his trump -- the Government foot soldiers. With
absences among the Opposition parties, the Home Office triumphed by 28
votes.
However, Mr Mullin could find allies when the Bill goes before their
lordships, a place where a well-turned argument is more likely to be
rewarded.

A few years ago, David Thomas wrote Not Guilty: In Defence of the
Modern Man. As KIRSTY SCOTT relates, in feminist eyes, he was guilty of
defending the indefensible -- but he can still have a chuckle about it.
FOR a woman-hating, humourless wimp, David Thomas can tell a good
joke. He throws them in when the conversation's getting too heavy, and
we're discussing the battle of the sexes, so the laughs are coming thick
and fast.
''We desperately need to chuckle at this,'' he says finally, after a
lengthy to-and-fro about gender ideology. ''I really hate the idea that
I'm seen as a po-faced defender of masculinity.''
The woman-hating, humourless wimp description is his own, part of a
collection he amassed over the 1993 publication of his book, Not Guilty:
In Defence of the Modern Man. Almost overnight, he went from the
ex-editor of Punch and a thirty-something father to the Voice of
Unreconstructed Man, the Men's Movement Pinky to Neil Lyndon's Perky,
the fall guy for feminism.
The main tenets of his book were that men were basically getting a bum
rap and that feminism was not all it was cracked up to be. More
specifically, he studied the biological, psychological and cultural
roots of masculinity and alleged that feminist thinking was not the
answer to the conflict between men and women.
''The book came out around the same time as Susan Faludi's Backlash
and people were looking around and saying 'Where's this backlash?' and
they fixed on me and I was it, I was the backlash.''
The ''diatribes'', as he calls them, have tailed off, but he is still
dusted down and brought out as the spokesperson for men in the UK. He's
been called a whinger, misogynist and even, inexplicably, a
transvestite. There's not much can rattle him these days.
He became the mouthpiece of men by a somewhat circuitous route. A
public schoolboy and Cambridge graduate, he toyed with journalism for a
while, ''churning out dreadful cheapo biogs of rock stars which,
thankfully, didn't get published''.
He then started working on women's magazines, including Cosmopolitan,
and became interested in the way men were being written about.
''It didn't seem to bear any relation to how I felt as a bloke. It
seemed the image of men being put across was really a long way from
where we were.''
Around this time he was offered a book contract and Not Guilty was
born. Despite reassurance from a ''protective shield'' of women editors,
Thomas said he knew the book would be controversial, but had no idea
just how much so.
''I just kind of waded into it, a bit like a blind man walking into a
minefield . . . I don't think anyone could have anticipated just how
irrational the response was. I started being attacked before I had even
written the book.
''I always thought someone was going to be brave enough to contradict
the received opinion but everyone had been told before the book came out
that I was writing this wimpy, misogynistic diatribe against women, so
that's what they reviewed . . . it killed the book commercially.''
He clearly feels betrayed by his own sex, many of whom were harder on
him for the views expressed in Not Gulity than women. ''There were so
many men who didn't want to be seen to be siding with me, who wanted to
display their feminist credentials.''
It was a difficult time and he felt he came close to losing his
livelihood. Two years on, with the trauma behind him, a healthy career
and a new book due -- about a laddish youth who gets a sex change by
mistake -- he claims to have a clearer sense of where men and women
stand. It's still pretty far apart and men are still society's
scapegoats.
''Fundamentally, what it's about is trying to work out the increasing
confusion which occurs in a world in which we are told that men and
women are equal but only men are bad. All legislation presumes equality
of men and women, but you don't have to go very far in the media or in
the attitude of academics or social workers to realise that there is
still a belief that women are fundamentally good and men are
fundamentally corrupted.
''We really do believe it's sugar and spice on the one hand and slugs
and snails on the other. It's not too paranoid to say that social work
today only considers men in terms of their potential as wife beaters or
child abusers. They really aren't taught that men might have the same
degree of emotional need as their female clients.''
There is also, he says, a casual man-hatred which is allowed to run
unchecked through the media, most noticeably in women's magazines. ''You
have all these articles -- Why are men so . . . --fill in the missing
word. Imagine a men's magazine that had an article, Why are Women Such
Bitches?
''I don't want to be a humourless, insecure neurotic, but if it's the
case that it's wrong constantly to denigrate women even as a joke then
why is it not wrong to do the same for men?''
But surely, it's OK to poke fun at those who wield the power and men
do, still, wield the power.
''That's true,'' says Thomas. ''The answer is that just because the
most powerful people are male does not mean that most men are powerful.
In many ways, men are less powerful. I don't think many men in
Easterhouse are in positions of power, do you?''
So if men are not in a position of power, where are they?
''I think they are completely confused. Men are not sure what they are
allowed to be and that uncertainty is not just restricted to
intellectuals. Lots and lots of young men don't really know if they are
allowed to find a picture of a woman sexy in case they are thought of as
sexist. Generally they are thinking 'Oh sod it'.
''I think a much more serious thing is there's a huge group of
particularly young men who are completely alienated from society, they
see no reason to believe in anything. They feel they have been betrayed
at every level, they probably don't have dads, a proper education, a
job.
''If you have hundreds of thousands of dispossessed men, you are bound
to have violence, crime, drunkenness, you are bound to have
wife-beating. What else are these guys going to do?
''Women have always had something else to do, physically having a
child. The problem with boys, if you don't give them a job, an
education, they have nothing else to turn to except violence and
crime.''
It was assertions like these and his belief that man-bashing,
literally, is a serious problem, that helped get Thomas into such hot
water over Not Guilty. He remains convinced of his views.
''I just think that women can be as violent as men, they can have as
much hostility as men because human beings can be as nasty as each other
. . . for every bastard out there, there's a woman who is denying her ex
access to his kids.''
The other key dilemma facing men at the moment, he says, is that they
are told to be caring, sharing people but are then berated by women for
being weak. ''It's really interesting how many women attacked me for
being a wimp. Failure and weakness are like cancer for men. They are
terrified of them. Yet the real mark of a man is to own up to things
he's really worried about and yet retain his dignity.''
He doesn't believe, however, that men can blame feminism, or women for
that matter, for the changes to their roles.
''You can't say it's all the fault of these women and I don't. I say
it's down to men to be responsible for their own wellbeing. Feminism has
been very influential but at the end of the day men have got to be big
boys . . . if guys just have the guts to stand up for their rights a bit
I don't think women would hate them for it. I think it will make things
better rather than worse.''
He thinks there is a growing sense that men may have been treated a
little unfairly, with some MPs, most notably Labour's women's champion,
Clare Short, acknowledging that some men are feeling marginalised.
''I think the monstrous regiment of feminists is little more than a
platoon now,'' he says. ''There are some angry women out there but the
vast majority of women are not frenzied feminists, most women want to
have a fair slice of the pie.''
Despite the problems he has just listed, Thomas believes if we trusted
our instincts a little more, the gender war as such could be a thing of
the past.
''I think one of the things by which both sexes have been confused is
that the ideology of gender has been so far apart from our instinct.
It's only so long that you can tell women to wear dungarees before she
wants to go and put on some make-up. It's only so long you can tell men
it's wrong to look at the Wonderbra ad, before they say 'Sod it'.
''What we have to somehow work out is how we have a modus vivendi
which allows us to retain the good bits about being male and female
without beating ourselves over the head with the bad bits. We haven't
got there yet and there are going to be real conflicts.''
In the meantime, he finds comfort in the egalitarian attitudes he
encounters among students, and, more specifically, in the concept of a
certain TV dating show.
''At the risk of sounding completely daft, the thing which cheers me
up is watching Blind Date. I think, well, in the end most of us want to
get on with each other . . . drooling over each other is a good place to
start.''
Before we reach any kind of middle ground, however, there's one very
basic issue which has to be sorted out, and it's delivered with true
Thomas in-your-face style at the end of the interview. It's the key to
the entire debate.
''The problem for men is: what are we supposed to do with our cocks?
Is it an oppressive tool or the sine qua non of great sex,'' he asks.
''We haven't worked that out. Do we want men to be men, or what?''

LOOPHOLES enabling the wealthy to get legal aid to pursue costly court
actions, are to be plugged, the Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern
announced last night.
Under the proposals for England and Wales, a special investigation
unit would assess an applicant's claim, and where appropriate the assets
of friends, relatives and children would be taken into account.
Lord Mackay said that trial judges would be allowed to release
financial details of a defendant.
Powers are also planned to recover legal aid from assets not declared,
and place #100,000 limits on the value of houses and mortgages when
assessing aid.
The move follows public concern that some rich individuals have
obtained thousands of pounds' worth of legal aid, while others less
well-off have been denied such financial help.
The proposals announced in a Lords written reply follow a consultation
process launched at the end of last year.
Last night, the Bar Council said it ''welcomed'' all but one of the
main proposals put forward by the Lord Chancellor.
A spokesman said they were concerned that discretionary powers would
be given to judges to assess the assets of friends' relatives and
children.
''This could introduce an element of subjectivity into an already
complex issue'' a spokesman said. ''Judges might be able to make an
assessment just on the kind of suit or tie a defendant is wearing.''
The Lord Chancellor's Department said last night that legal aid is
available to 47% of the population, and about 3.5 million people are
expected to be helped by the scheme this year.

LORD Morton of Shuna, the High Court and Court of Session judge, died
yesterday at the age of 65 after a lengthy battle against cancer.
Typically, Lord Morton refused to give in to his illness and was working
until a few days before his death.
Last night, two of his colleagues on the Scottish bench paid tribute
to the man and his career. Lord Johnston said: ''Hugh's death will leave
a great hole in my life. Over most of my career at the bar, he was the
most respected and honest opponent I ever had.
''We were able to settle or fight cases with the complete honesty
which I think the bar must have. We disagreed politically on practical
everything but that wasn't the point. He was straight, honest, and in
many ways a great man.''
Lord McCluskey said: ''What you saw was what you got. Hugh Morton was
a remarkably frank, honest, and straightforward man. He performed all
his public life very quietly and effectively and people grew to
appreciate the quiet wisdom of the man. Essentially, he was a private
person who loved his family, his music, and his walking holidays.''
Hugh Drennan Baird Morton was the son of a minister and was educated
at Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University. He was called to the Scottish
Bar in 1965 and became a QC nine years later. He served as a Crown
Prosecutor for nearly 10 years in two different spells between 1967 and
1971 and from 1974 to 1979.
Before his elevation to the bench in October, 1988, he had succeeded
Lord McCluskey as the Labour Party's legal affairs spokesman in the
House of Lords.
Hugh Morton remained a fearless and outspoken critic of what he saw as
the law's shortcomings.Twice in high-profile murder trials, he took the
brave decision to acquit the accused on the view that there was not
enough evidence to send the case to the jury.
Speaking in the House of Lords last November, in what some felt was
his valedictory address, he lambasted procedures in the Court of Session
as out of date, too slow, and far too expensive.
He always showed sympathy for the underdog and was concerned that
judges really didn't understand the problems of offenders from deprived
areas.
Lord Morton is survived by his wife, three sons, and four
grandchildren.

AFTER long-drawn out negotiations, a #15m package to secure and manage
the 77,500-acre Mar Lodge estate for the nation was finally sealed
yesterday with help from national lottery profits.
The estate on Deeside, one of the most important conservation areas in
Europe, has been bought from businesman Mr John Kluge by the National
Trust For Scotland. The NTS will manage it with help from Scottish
Natural Heritage.
The World Wild Life Fund Scotland said it was excellent news that Mar
Lodge would no longer be subject to the Russian roulette of the
international property market.
Mr Simon Pepper, head of WWF Scotland said the whole episode
demonstrated the scandalous situation in which ownership by a
conservation body is the only option for serious protection of
Scotland's natural heritage.
The estate, which is set in the heart of the Cairngorms, covers 117
square miles, contains four of the six highest peaks in Britain and 14
Munros. There are seven-listed buildings including Mar Lodge, whose
foundation stone was laid by Queen Victoria.
Its breath-taking scenery and natural beauty attracts visitors from
all over the world. Field sports enthusiasts come to the area for
shooting and fishing holidays.
The deal to buy the estate was secured after the Heritage Lottery Fund
agreed it would contribute more than #10m from lottery profits towards
its purchase and running costs.
Mr Kluge sold the estate for a sum of #5.5m -- believed to be at least
#5m below its market value. More than #4m of the purchase price came
from Edinburgh-based charity, The Easter Charitable Trust, with the rest
coming from the lottery funds
An #8m endowment scheme set up with the rest of the lottery money has
been started to help pay the long-term running costs. Other income will
come from shooting, fishing, and walking holidays on the estate.
Mar Lodge is likely to be turned into accommodation for field sports
enthusiasts. Furnished apartments in the lodge could cost around #600 a
week in the high season.
Despite the cash input from the lottery fund, the Easter Charitable
Trust, and Scottish Natural Heritage, there will still be a public
appeal for #1m to help pay for footpath building and other works.
The Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, said that the purchase was a
significant step towards achieving the sustainable management of this
very special area.
Lord Rothschild, chairman of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, said
that he was delighted that money from the lottery was going to preserve
one of the most extraordinary wild places in Scotland.
Mr Magnus Magnusson, chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage, who has
campaigned to secure the estate for public ownership for years, said it
had been described as the jewel in the Cairngorm crown, but that jewel
had become tarnished. He said it had been ''battered'' in recent years
and he was confident good management could improve things.
Mr Hamish Leslie Melville, chairman of the National Trust for
Scotland, said striking the balance between the conservation element of
the estate and the sporting side would not be a problem.
He said that a condition of the sale put on by Mr Kluge was that field
sports would be allowed to continue.
Mar Lodge was one of only two projects in Scotland which shared in the
#24.6m total pay-out from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The other was the Dundee Heritage Trust who were given #419,000
towards their plans to start an exhibition demonstrating jute
manufacture.
Twenty-five applications from Scotland for lottery money has been
received so far by the Heritage Lottery Fund, 9% of total applications.
Meanwhile, retailers suspected of National Lottery ticket fiddles were
yesterday warned that they could end up in court after organisers
Camelot took action against three more outlets over ''alleged
irregularities'' in sales of Instants tickets.
Camelot announced that retailers, in Essex, London, and Liverpool have
had their contracts terminated and equipment removed bringing the number
involved to five.
A second Liverpool retailer has been suspended from selling tickets
pending further investigation.

A BARMAID found herself out of a job after she ditched her boss and
struck up a relationship with the pub bandleader, an industrial tribunal
in Inverness heard yesterday.
Yesterday, Ms Donna Stephen, 22, who is claiming sex discrimination
described to lawyer Mr Victor Tough how she had worked in Gunsmith's
bar, in the centre of Inverness, which is owned by three brothers,
David, Brian, and Graeme Thomson.
After Ms Stephen ended the four-month relationship with Mr Graeme
Thomson, 31, she started going out with Mr Andrew Murray, 31, whose
band, The Big Thing, played in the bar.
Mr Thomson later telephoned her at home to ask if she was seeing
someone else. She replied that she was but when asked if it was someone
in the band she refused to say who it was.
Later, in another call, Mr Thomson asked Ms Stephen, a single parent,
of Murray Place, Smithton, Inverness, not to come into work for a couple
of weeks.
He told her that he needed a break from seeing her, because knowing
that she was going out with someone else was upsetting for him.
However, she told him she could not afford the time off, as she had to
support herself and young daughter. She said: ''I asked him if he was
sacking me and he said yes.
''I was very upset and crying. I demanded to be sacked to my face, if
it was going to happen, and I turned up for work as usual.''
She was met by Mr Thomson's two brothers, who told her that she was
not being fired from Gunsmith's but they were tightening up the staff
rules.
She told the tribunal: ''I felt they would be looking for the first
thing I did wrong to get rid of me.''
The atmosphere behind the bar became bad, with the manager speaking to
her only when asked, she said. Matters came to a head when she
discovered her hours had been cut.
She asked Mr Mike Seath, the pub's manager, if he had been ordered to
do this and he replied: ''They pay my wages. I need the job.''
Ms Stephen then left and started to work at another Inverness
nightspot.
Under cross-examination from lawyer Ms Lorna Murray, she agreed that
Mr Thomson was ''sensitive and not vindictive'', and would have been
hurt when he discovered she was seeing Mr Murray as he had been hoping
for a reconciliation.
The tribunal was adjourned.

A JURY was asked yesterday to believe three ''frightened'' witnesses
that Mr Kenneth McGuire, 35, twice threw a man out of a fourth-floor
window and murdered him.
The jurors were asked not to accept Mr McGuire's story to police that
he tried to stop two other men tossing Mr Kenneth Syme, 48, out of the
window at a Hogmanay party.
The body of Mr Syme, of Fullers Gate, Faifley, Clydebank, was found in
a wheelie-bin on New Year's Day.
His injuries included multiple fractures and internal damage. Mr Ian
Duguid, prosecuting, told the High Court in Glasgow there was ample
evidence to show Mr McGuire and his flatmate Mr Michael Fay threw Mr
Syme out the window the first time.
He said that when Fay, 29, and Raymond Henfry, 28, carried the man
back to the bedroom he was still alive.
Mr Duguid said the jury should accept evidence that McGuire shouted:
''What the f... is that bastard doing back here,'' before throwing Mr
Syme back out of the same window.
Mr McGuire denies repeatedly throwing Mr Syme out of the fourth-floor
window of his flat at Watchmeal Crescent, Faifley, Clydebank, on January
1 last and murdering him, and assaulting another man in the house that
night.
Yesterday, the Crown withdrew charges that he tied the body up and hid
it in a wheelie-bin, and threatened to throw another man from the window
on a previous occasion.
Mr McGuire has lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming Fay
and Henfry who have had their pleas of not guilty to murder accepted by
the Crown.
Fay pled guilty to throwing Mr Syme out of the window once and
attempting to murder him, and Henfry has admitted moving Mr Syme in the
wheelie-bin with intent to defeat the ends of justice.
They will both be sentenced at the end of the trial.
Mr Duguid said that, despite being ''scared'', three men, Henfry, Mr
Douglas Gordon, 33, and Mr Robert Docherty, 42, had all spoken up to
what Mr McGuire did that night.
Henfry said he tried to pull Mr Syme back by the legs as Fay and Mr
McGuire threw him out the first time.
He also said he was in the room when Mr McGuire grabbed the man and
''papped'' him out a second time.
Mr Gordon said he had seen Mr McGuire putting the man out of the
window.
Mr Duguid also asked the jury to discount defence suggestions that Mr
Syme was already dead when he was thrown out the second time.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending, accused the Crown of trying to
''bully'' the jury into convicting Mr McGuire.
He said that because Henfry and Fay had their not guilty pleas to the
murder charge accepted did not mean the jury had to convict Mr McGuire.
Mr Findlay said Henfry and Fay had lied to protect themselves and that
Mr Gordon had also lied in his evidence.
The counsel asked the jury how they could accept the word of Henfry
who claimed he was concerned about Mr Syme but had not even bothered to
call for the police or an ambulance after the man was thrown out again
and said nothing until the police came to see him later that day.
Instead, he said, Henfry had continued drinking before going on to
another party.
Mr Findlay said he was not defending the actions of Mr McGuire in not
getting help for Mr Syme. It was ''despicable, contemptible, and
callous''.
However, that was not an act of murder.
The jury would have to accept the words of liars before they could
convict Mr McGuire.
The judge Lord Osborne will address the jury today.

A HEN has hatched three rare falcon chicks but will have little chance
to enjoy her brood. The chicks will soon be reunited with their natural
parents and, ironically, chicken will feature in their diet.
The three Lanner Falcons were hatched this week at the Scottish Centre
for Falconry near Kinross.
They will eventually be freed on a Greek island near Corfu as part of
a Greek Government plan to reintroduce the birds of prey to their
natural habitat.
Falconer Phil Allen, explained: ''We use a broody hen to hatch the
falcon chicks because Lanner Falcons are very clumsy with their own
eggs. The chicks, two males and a female, will remain with the hen for
about 10 days before we place them with their parents here at the
centre.''
He added that the hen's eggs had been incubated and would be returned
to her so she will have her own chicks.
Once back with their parents, however, the young falcons will be fed
on a diet which includes day-old chickens.
''It does sound a bit ungrateful,'' admitted Mr Allen. ''But that is
nature and they will also be fed on quail and pigeon.''
Lanner Falcons originally come from North Africa and parts of
Mediterranean Europe but pesticides and hunters have taken a toll and
the birds are now an endangered species in Greece and Italy.
Mr Allen said the Greek Government has established nature reserves on
some of the Greek islands and is educating hunters not to shoot the
birds.

THE Royal Air Force is to mothball its base at Stornoway airport,
which was a central element in the Nato defence strategy during the Cold
War, writes DAVID ROSS.
The base was upgraded as a forward operational base at a cost of #30m
in the early 1980s, after a concerted local campaign of opposition and a
public inquiry whose reporter found against the expansion of the base,
only to be over-ruled by the then Secretary of State for Scotland,
George, now Lord Younger.
The RAF proposes to leave it on a care and maintenance basis managed
by civilian contractors. The 35 service staff and five civilian staff at
the base were told on March 29 that a detailed study was under way to
determine the extent of such a contract, and that the study would take
approximately 32 weeks.
Base commander, Flight Lieutenant Ian Denny, said yesterday: ''This is
part of the peace dividend, as we try to adjust to the new defence
demands. The 35 service staff will be moving on.''
Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald told The Herald yesterday: ''My prime
concern now will be to try and ensure that the benefits brought to the
local community by the base, in terms of employment and income, are
maintained.
''It could be that there will be more local jobs involved, with
civilian contractors managing the base on a care and maintenance
basis.''

A 16-YEAR-OLD student was recovering yesterday after being shot in the
mouth by a gang of youths who tried unsuccessfully to rob him.
Ryan Cooper, a sports science student, of Kirkintilloch, was standing
in a pedestrian underpass in Newlairdsland Road near Corbeille Essonnes
Way in Kirkintilloch at around 8.20pm on Tuesday when he was confronted
by several youths, one of whom was brandishing what is believed to have
been an air pistol.
The youth threatened Mr Cooper with the pistol and demanded money. He
refused, at which point the youth put the air pistol to his mouth and
fired.
The youths then made off towards Newlairdsland Road. Mr Cooper was
taken to Stobhill Hospital, where he received treatment for an injury to
his tongue and bruising to his mouth. He was released a short time
later.
Detective Sergeant Cameron Cavin, of Kirkintilloch CID, who is leading
the hunt for the youths, said Mr Cooper had been lucky not to suffer a
more severe injury. ''It is highly possible the outcome could have been
far more serious.''
He added: ''An act of such violence causes great concern because of
the fear and terror the boy suffered during the assault. As you would
expect, Ryan was quite shaken by the incident.''
Detective Sergeant Cavin said one of the youths involved in the
assault was a white male, 18 to 19 years of age, of medium build,
wearing a black/grey baseball cap, black denim jacket, black track suit
trousers, and black leather boots. He was believed to have a Glasgow
accent. He had no description for the other youths.

SCOTTISH Cup finalists Airdrie may be only a game away from European
football but they are currently waiting for a Scottish Office decision
which could determine whether the 117-year-old club folds or survives.
The problem involves finding a new stadium site. The club sold their
former ground, Broomfield Park, to supermarket chain Safeway for a
reputed #4.5m two years ago.
The sell-off was an attempt to meet the requirements forced on clubs
following the Taylor Report, set up in the aftermath of the Hillsborough
disaster.
However, finding an acceptable site for all concerned for a new
10,000-capacity all-seater stadium is proving a problem.
Success, and the club's future, could rest on whether the Scottish
Office gives planning control to the district or regional council, with
both board and supporters less than optimistic.
Club officials and the district council could agree on only one of 16
possible sites, 30 acres of green belt land at Raebog, outside Airdrie.
Airdrie, meanwhile, have been playing on the outskirts of Cumbernauld
having negotiated a lease at Broadwood, a new all-seated stadium built
for Clyde FC.
The move has been financially crippling for Airdrie. Although
Broadwood is less than 10 miles from Broomfield, crowds have averaged
just 2000, with only 800 present on occasion.
Airdrie vice-chairman, Mr David Smith, who blames the club's present
plight on their willingness to conform with Taylor, says the windy
ground is simply too cold and uncomfortable for older supporters.
Mr Smith said gate revenue was not even meeting rental charges at home
games. It is clearly essential that Airdrie are in a new stadium at the
start of season 1996-97, when they could also again be a premier
division side.
However, although having agreed on a suitable site with Monklands
District Council, and the authority having granted planning permission
for Raebog despite objections from residents of the nearby village of
Glenmavis, the odds are still against Airdrie having a new ground in 16
months' time.
Normally, Strathclyde Regional Council would have the final say on
whether planning application was granted: and given the region's policy
on green belt land, an application on this scale would almost certainly
be turned down.
Monklands therefore appealed to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang against
the calling-in of the application by the larger authority. Mr Lang now
has to decide whether Monklands or Strathclyde will deal with the
planning application.
If he and his advisers rule in favour of the district council, Airdrie
can look forward to being in the new stadium by August 1996. If the
regional council is the approved authority, the club's future is
uncertain as they would have to persuade the region there is a one-off
case for the council allowing a breach of its own structural plan.
It is the third, and some would say most likely, scenario which could
put Airdrie out of business: the region could listen to local opinion
and heed its own structure plan, thereby refusing the application.
The club would then be left with only one course of action: a further
appeal to the Secretary of State, this time in the hope he would order a
public inquiry.
Airdrie's directors are reluctant to talk on the record about how they
would cope with such a crisis, beyond calling an emergency general
meeting and consulting shareholders. However, both chairman George Peat,
and his deputy, Mr Smith, have indicated that the time and cost involved
would put a public inquiry beyond Airdrie's means.
The supporters' club chairman, Mr Ronnie Orr, is in no doubt that the
club faces extinction if it cannot resolve its problem quickly.
''Every club has its hard core of supporters but I've noticed this
season that the edges of our hard core are beginning to fragment and
disappear,'' he said.
''If there is still no new stadium by the end of the next season, I
fear for the future of Airdrie. Our concern as supporters is no longer
where the club is going, it's for the club itself. The situation can't
go on any longer.''
He did not blame the board. ''Broomfield was in a desperate mess. It
was costing more and more money each year to bring it up to standard.
The board had no option.''
A spokesman at the Scottish Office confirmed last night that the
Scottish Secretary had received a letter from the district council
arguing that it should take the planning decision instead of Strathclyde
region. He said the matter was being considered and a decision would be
made soon.

<HEADLINE>Court clears way for Faslane sailings    Rifkind wins Trident ban on Greenpeace</HEADLINE>

A JUDGE yesterday granted a court order banning Greenpeace from
obstructing the passage of Trident submarines from their base at
Faslane.
The Government alleged that the lives of servicemen could be
endangered by the tactics being employed by the environmental protest
group.
The application for an interim interdict at the Court of Session was
made on behalf of Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind. It followed a
weekend demonstration by the Greenpeace vessel, the Moby Dick, against
HMS Vanguard.
Mr Raymond Doherty, counsel for Mr Rifkind, asked the court to grant
an interim interdict banning Greenpeace from interfering with Royal Navy
submarines in the area of Rhu Narrows.
Lord Johnston was told it was the declared intention of Greenpeace to
disrupt and impede submarine sailings.
Last Saturday, HMS Vanguard set out on patrol from Faslane with an
escort of tugs and police launches. The Moby Dick was anchored at Holy
Loch and sailed towards Gareloch to intercept the submarine.
Small inflatables from the Moby Dick attempted to block the Vanguard
by sailing close to the submarine and crossing in front of her. Nets,
nylon lines, and plastic containers were placed in the path of the
Vanguard.
The Defence Secretary alleged that if these objects had been sucked
into the submarine's propulsion system they would have caused damage and
the lives of crew would have been put at risk.
Mr Doherty, as well as asking the court for an order banning
Greenpeace from impeding or interfering with the safe passage of the
submarines heading to sea from Faslane, also asked the judge to ban the
organisation from moving the Moby Dick into Rhu Narrows or from mooring
there.
He said the Government was ''reasonably apprehensive'' that Greenpeace
would try to mount further similar actions against the submarine fleet.
He told the court: ''There are two further sailings of submarines in
the next few days which would be at risk if such activities were
repeated.''
Greenpeace's actions plainly amounted to an interference with the
right of navigation and malicious mischief or at least an attempt at
malicious mischief.
Lord Johnston said he was satisfied that a prima facie case for
interdict had been established.
Greenpeace was not represented at yesterday's hearing.
A Greenpeace spokesman in London criticised the Government action.
He said: ''It is absolutely incredible to us that the Government feels
the UK's independent nuclear deterrent is so precarious that it needs to
be protected by the courts from peaceful demonstrations by Greenpeace.''
He also warned that protests against Britain's development of nuclear
weapons and production of plutonium would continue. ''We have about 10
injunctions from BNFL and will add this to our collection of legal
restraints from the nuclear industry but it won't do anything to stop
Greenpeace from protesting against Britain's ongoing development of
nuclear weapons and production of plutonium.''
Mr Christopher Donnelly, the procurator-fiscal in Dumbarton, said he
was aware of last weekend's incident at Faslane and that people had been
charged and various items -- including three boats -- had been recovered
from the Clyde by MoD Police.
Mr Donnelly said he had been told the matter was being reported to him
but that he still awaited the report.
He was not aware of the interim interdict served on Greenpeace on
behalf of Mr Rifkind when contacted by The Herald last night.

THE man accused of an assault in Edinburgh's Caledonian Hotel where
musicians Van Morrison and Georgie Fame were drinking has been
acquitted.
Mr Graham Philp, 40, told the city's sheriff court that rock legend
Morrison had misunderstood an innocent remark which later led to a
confrontation between himself and Mr Frank Connolly, 39.
Mr Morrison, after accusing Mr Philp of calling him an ''asshole'',
got up and left the table where he and Mr Philp had been sitting. He
went over to where Mr Connolly was standing with keyboard player Georgie
Fame and, later, when Mr Philp walked past them, Mr Connolly confronted
him.
Mr Connolly ended up with a broken eye socket and fractured skull
after being punched once by Mr Philp and falling backwards on to a
carpet-covered marble floor.
However, Mr Philp told the jury that he acted in self-defence after
being pushed and punched by Mr Connolly, a retired firefighter, from
Millhill Street, Dunfermline.
After deliberating for one hour, the jury found the charge against Mr
Philp of assaulting Mr Connolly to his severe injury and permanent
impairment last May 7 not proven. It found Mr Philp, an offshore
drilling supervisor, of Kalulu Cottage, Tannadice, Forfar, not guilty of
breach of the peace.
The trial heard that Mr Morrison and Mr Fame were relaxing after a
concert. It was about 3am and the bar was closed but the night staff
were still serving drinks.
Mr Connolly and Mr Philp, who did not previously know each other, had
been at the same table at a rugby dinner and were staying at the hotel.
Mr Connolly told the jury that, when Mr Morrison came across to where
he was standing with Mr Fame, he was concerned that Mr Philp had been
verbally abusing him and might start again.
Mr Connolly claimed that Mr Philp came towards them and lashed out
when Mr Connolly tried to calm him down.

A 72-YEAR-OLD man was jailed for four years yesterday after sexually
molesting three young sisters.
Daniel McMahon committed ''outrageous abuse'' on the girls more than a
decade ago, the High Court in Edinburgh heard. The girls were then aged
between 10 and 12.
McMahon, of Mossvale Path, Craigend, Glasgow, was convicted on five
charges by a jury at Glasgow Sheriff Court earlier this year. Sheriff
Kenneth Mitchell ordered that he should be sent to the High Court for
sentence.
The sheriff said his maximum powers of sentence -- three years'
imprisonment -- were insufficient. His decision to remit McMahon to the
higher court was greeted with cheering by the sisters.
Advocate depute Iain Bonomy, QC, told the High Court yesterday that
McMahon, a widower, befriended the girls, who had ''a very sad family
background''.
Their mother was struck down with terminal cancer and their father was
an alcoholic. The girls received little regular attention or affection.
The abuse came to light in 1993 when one of the victims phoned a
social worker and asked her to go to a Glasgow police station with her.
The victims are all now in their twenties and at least one of them is
still haunted by the harrowing experience she went through. Mr Bonomy
told the court: ''She has been particularly badly affected. Thoughts of
what happened to her never seemed to leave her mind.''
Defence counsel Mr Dennis Crawley said McMahon had been convicted of
offences that attracted society's contempt and disgust, ''but he is 72
and a frail 72.'' McMahon, who lived alone, suffered from ulcers,
asthma, and a perforated eardrum.
Mr Crawley argued that a jail sentence would be excessive in the
circumstances.
However, the Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Ross, said: ''I am bound to take
a serious view of these offences, because of their nature and because of
the age of the girls. A custodial sentence is inevitable.''
Lord Ross said he took into account McMahon's age and lack of previous
convictions.

With Rupert Murdoch poised to win the franchise for a fifth
terrestrial television channel, reports on the risk of media domination
Aspiring to be the monarch of all he surveys? Rupert Murdoch now has
his eye on the expansion of his television empire
HE is not yet monarch of all he surveys, but if Michael Grade is right
then the day will come when British television is as surely dominated by
Rupert Murdoch as he already towers over the British print media.
If the franchise for Channel 5, the last big terrestrial channel
viewers will be able to get for free, falls into his hands then, Mr
Grade warned, Rupert Murdoch would be ''in the most dominating position
any media baron ever had been in this country''.
But his suggested remedies have fallen on deaf ears. He wanted the
Government to amend the 1990 Broadcasting Act, which Mr Murdoch has
exploited to his own advantage, by introducing a one-clause Bill giving
the Independent Television Commission wider discretion so it could
ignore the highest bid, or instruct the ITC to wait until the planned
new ownership rules are in place.
Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell, agreeing yesterday that there was
a need to review the regulatory provisions imposed by the Act, said the
way to do so was by ''proper deliberation'', which is ministerial-speak
for doing as little as possible for as long as possible.
By the time the deliberations have taken place it could be too late to
prevent the takeover forecast by Mr Grade. The point about Mr Murdoch is
that he is not a passive shareholder in anything in which he
participates. Eventually he runs it. As Mr Grade said -- he plays to win
and he will use his newspapers, as he already does on behalf of BSkyB,
to promote this new channel in their columns.
Naturally BSkyB dismissed Mr Grade's remarks -- he warned that Mr
Murdoch would take an unbreakable stranglehold on Britain's entire
broadcasting system -- as ill-judged, ill-informed, and blatantly
untrue. ''If BSkyB participates in a consortium bidding for Channel 5,
which has not yet been decided, it will do so within the rules and
within the law,'' a spokesman added.
In fact, Mr Murdoch has done nothing outside the law to gain his
present pre-eminence, he has simply used it in a way that Parliament,
always suspicious of cross-media ownership, did not intend. The
percentage limits set in 1990 did not apply to non-domestic satellites
which provided him with the necessary loophole allowing him to build a
multi-channel television network broadcasting to Britain while owning
such a large percentage of the British press.
The closing date for licence applications is May 2, so Mr Grade's
outburst is something of an eleventh-hour warning. His case is this: if
the Murdoch consortium gets the licence for Channel 5 it would
''permanently remove all hope of fair and effective media-ownership
rules in the United Kingdom''. The game would be over before the
Government had even started to clarify the rules.
So why is Mr Murdoch such a bogeyman? To start with his News
International owns The Times, The Sunday Times, The Sun, News of the
World and Today, some 36% of the British print media. His seven-channel
satellite TV company, BSkyB, 40% owned by News International, which was
formed when Sky and BSB merged as a result of the failure of the latter,
is a financial success, a veritable dripping roast. But it is a
satellite company and it requires an act of will for people to view it.
Ownership of Channel 5 would give him a foothold in British
terrestrial television which, with his other assets, could make him an
almost unbeatable force because all the viewer has to do is flick the
remote control. He has already used BSkyB's spending power to acquire a
whole range of top sporting events for its sports channels, and there is
his ability to buy up the latest films for his cinema channel to take
into account.
With the addition of a terrestrial channel, on which he could lavish
the same extravagance, he could rapidly put the BBC out of the running
in any auction for major sporting events -- farewell Wimbledon -- while
the ITV companies, not exactly paupers, would almost certainly find
themselves also-rans.
But the Murdoch empire does not stop there. He owns 68% of the Far
Eastern Star TV network based in Hong Kong, which serves 53 countries,
as well as the 20th Century Fox film studios, Fox Television, and his
Australian media empire. He is a global media mogul, currently looking
at prospects in Eastern Europe, whose buying power is illustrated by his
latest plan to create an international rugby league, Super League, which
could have serious repercussions for the game as we know it.
Channel 5 has a potential audience of 15 million people because it
will only reach some 70% of British homes -- its Scottish coverage is
basically the Central Lowlands and up the east coast -- but that is no
mean potential in advertising terms. The channel will also offer an
alternative for those viewers -- and few think four channels enough --
who have resisted the blandishments of satellite and cable television
companies which only reach around 4.2 million homes.
The dilemma for Mr Murdoch is that if he gets Channel 5 he will be
competing with his own BSkyB for viewers, but he has managed to
reconcile the conflicting demands of his print media interests and there
is no reason why this should not happen in television too.
The consortium is supposed to include Granada, as well as Mr Murdoch,
but a spokesman for the group insisted yesterday that a decision on
whether to go ahead had still not been made, and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees
Television Holdings plc, who had considered joining, have not done so.
The other members are Telecommunications Inc, the Swedish conglomerate
Kinnevok AB, Goldman Sachs, and Polygram.
The likely rivals are a consortium made up of MAI plc, Pearson plc,
and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion; another one brings
together Richard Branson's Virgin Group, HTV Group plc, Associated
Newspapers plc, and Philips NV with the venture capital group Electra
and Paramount Television Ltd. The Canadian broadaster CanWest is also
believed to be keen to bid, but the consortium headed by the Mirror
Group and the US television network, NBC, pulled out yesterday.
Mr Murdoch, therefore, faces competition for this new channel which is
expected to start broadcasting by January 1, 1997 at the latest, but he
does seem to be the most formidable potential owner. He certainly has
the funds to put in the highest bid to the ITC.
There are only two other media tycoons in Europe who have anything
like his influence -- Leo Kirsch in Germany, with whom he has formed a
strategic alliance -- and Carlo Berlusconi, through the Italian Silvio
Berlusconi Communications (SBC) group, part of the massive Gruppo
Fininvest.
Most European countries have the same mixture of state and commercial
television as we do, if for the sake of the argument, one accepts the
BBC as the state broadcasting company. But they do not have the same
licensing arrangements which resulted in the farce that was the last
auction of franchises when the winning bids ranged from #2000, a
calculated gamble that nobody else was interested, to a whopping #43m a
year.
The Government does appear loth to act. Change may come, but it is
patently in no hurry to bring it about. Mr Murdoch, of course, has a
powerful weapon at his disposal -- his newspapers. Who will they support
in the next General Election?
The Government has felt the Murdoch lash, and Labour, which seems
intent on relaxing the rules governing cross-media ownership, has no
wish to annoy him in these delicate days -- Mr Murdoch said last year in
Der Spiegel that he ''could imagine'' his newspapers supporting Mr
Blair, which would indeed be a turn-up for the books. In the past Labour
has had to make do with only the loyalty of the Mirror.
The 1992 election manifesto promised a Monopolies and Mergers
Commission inquiry into the concentration of ownership, a pledge
repeated by the then Shadow Heritage spokesman, Ann Clwyd, in 1993 when
she described his share of the print media as an ''unacceptable
concentration of power''. Labour believes the present regime is a
shambles because it limits UK newspaper publishers' holding to 20%, but
allows overseas publishers to buy what they wish.
Whatever else he is doing Mr Grade is not crying wolf. The ITC has no
options but to give it to the highest bidder, the usual platitudes about
commitments to worthy objectives apart, and anybody can make those since
there is little need to keep them.
Carlton, which ousted Thames, is an example of promises, promises. As
for advertisers, cross-media ownership can be a good thing because deals
can be struck, something off here, a pole position there, which suit
them, while still bringing in revenue to the television company.
The chances are that Britain can support a third commercial channel,
although it may have repercussions for the print media. If that channel
and a large chunk of the print media go hand-in-hand, however, then it
is not good news for the rest of the newspaper world which has already
suffered from the irresponsible use of the Murdoch financial muscle in
the price-cutting wars.

A NEW ''bible'' for drafting wills in Scotland was launched yesterday
by four Edinburgh lawyers. It replaces the standard solicitors'
textbook, published nearly 50 years ago.
A copy of Drafting Wills In Scotland, which took nearly eight years to
write, was presented to 84-year-old Mr Archibald Elder, author of the
1947 handbook which became the first guide to drawing up wills north of
the Border.
Mr Hugh Stevens and Mr Andrew Dalgleish, partners in the law firm
Brodies, joined forces with Mr John Biggar, a partner in Tods Murray,
and Alan Barr, a director of the Legal Practice Unit at Edinburgh
University, to compile the 500-page book.
About 1000 copies of the new guide to wills are expected to be sold to
lawyers throughout Scotland.
Mr Stevens said the four friends were ''relieved'' to have completed
the work, which is dedicated to their wives because of the amount of
time taken up by research and writing.
Changes in the law in the last five decades had prompted the new work
but the authors believe there will be little need for a new edition in
their lifetime, unless there are dramatic changes in the law on wills.
The book also has its own mascot, Spot the dog, who helps inject an
element of humour into the publication.
''We used Spot as a release when we were becoming delirious and
decided to incorporate him into the book,'' explained Mr Stevens.

A TABBY cat has lost several of his nine lives after getting trapped
in the fan belt of a moving Land Rover.
Tam, who lives on the remote Argyll island of Colonsay, survived the
ordeal after the driver heard his squeals. However, his adventures cost
Tam a leg, which was amputated in Oban on Tuesday after he got an
emergency flight to the vet's. His jaw was also broken.
His owner, Ms Laura Brown, said: ''He is a complete nut-case but this
is his worst disaster. He is not even a year old.''  She added: ''He is
always fiddling around under cars. Everybody on the island looks under
their car now before they drive away -- but they don't look in the

WOMEN must be allowed to play their full part as employees and service
users in the new single-tier local government structure, a report by the
Equal Opportunities Commission in Scotland urges.
The report says the 29 new councils must integrate equality of
opportunity into both their treatment of employees and the way they
deliver services.
At present, the majority of the 300,000 council employees are women
but they are concentrated in the lower grades. A total of 86% of
clerical staff are women but they make up fewer than 20% of principal
officers. There are only two women chief executives out of 65, two
female education directors and four women directors of social work.
However, the EOC says the position is improving, although progress
towards equality at senior management level is slow.
The report, entitled Quality through Equality and written by Ms Esther
Breitenbach of Edinburgh University, stresses it is vitally important
that this progress towards change is not halted by the process of
reorganisation.
Ms Morag Alexander, director of EOC Scotland, said yesterday: ''Many
of the current local authorities have developed policies, practices, and
initiatives in service delivery and for their own employees and have
made positive progress.
''The new authorities must draw on that tradition, experience, and
expertise brought together in this report to achieve quality through
equality.''
Although the report concentrates on the position of women, wherever
possible examples of policies which promote equal opportunities for
members of ethnic minorities and people with disabilities are included.
Among the examples of good practice towards staff in the report is the
system of departmental equal opportunities working groups set up by
Edinburgh District Council.
On service delivery and equal opportunities, the report lists Glasgow
District Council's women and sport development team and Strathclyde
region's social strategy which aims to reduce disadvantage and to tackle
the effects of deprivation.

PRISON Service director Derek Lewis will keep his #125,000-a-year job
for at least another year, Home Secretary Michael Howard announced last
night.
He added in a Commons written reply that the contract of the former
television executive, appointed in 1993 to run jails in England and
Wales, would end at the latest in January 1998.
The announcement, amounting to a job reprieve for Mr Lewis, comes
after disclosure that the rate of escapes from prisons and escort
services dropped by 67% in the six months to this March, compared with
the same period two years ago.
Some observers thought Mr Lewis would be the scapegoat for a series of
embarrassing incidents such as the discovery of Semtex at Whitemoor
prison, Cambridgeshire and the death of Frederick West, awaiting trial
accused of the Gloucester ''House of Horror'' murders.

PLANS by the TUC to broadcast a five-part series of television
programmes have been thrown into disarray by last-minute demands for
changes in the first, due to be screened early next Monday.
The BBC was accused of ''panicking'' over the planned broadcast after
the controversy surrounding the recent Panorama interview with the Prime
Minister.
The first 15-minute programme is due to go out on BBC2 at 5.45am next
Monday under the corporation's ''Select'' service -- which allows
non-profit-making organisations to broadcast educational and training
information during off-peak hours.
However, it would be just three days before local government elections
in England and Wales. With the row over the Panorama interview ahead of
last month's polls in Scotland still fresh in the memory -- and the
argument over plans for coverage of next Saturday's special Labour Party
conference on Clause 4 -- several objections have been raised.
Yesterday, the TUC complained that the BBC's management board had
called for changes to the script even though it had been approved by BBC
Select. ''The broadcast is non-political and follows BBC producer
guidelines,'' said a TUC spokesman.
BBC managers want to remove a reference to a local strike by Transport
and General Workers Union bus drivers and an interview with TUC general
secretary John Monks in which he calls for improved rights for part-time
workers.
A BBC spokesman said: ''We are discussing minor changes to ensure the
programme complies with Select's educational and training remit.''
The TUC, which paid to have the programme made, accused the BBC of
''interference''. A spokesman said: ''We feel we have been caught up in
a political panic following the Panorama interview.''
Before opening urgent discussions with BBC top management yesterday
evening, Mr Monks said such last-minute editorial interference was just
not acceptable.
The TUTV project involves five 15-minute programmes to be broadcast at
5.45am on the first Monday of each month between May and September, with
each programme repeated weekly at the same time and day throughout the
month.
It is hoped up to 300,000 trade unionists will either tune in or set
their videos to record the programmes, which will be presented by Susan
Rae.

DRINK driver Henry Gilchrist escaped a prison sentence at Edinburgh
Sheriff Court yesterday.
Sheriff James Farrell heard that Gilchrist, 52, was very ill and only
physically capable of driving for about 10 minutes.
''Ten minutes is enough time to wreak havoc,'' pointed out the
sheriff, who said his main concern was protecting the public. He said
Gilchrist had ''an appalling record which would richly merit prison''.
Sheriff Farrell decided to defer sentence for six months to see if
Gilchrist could stay away from cars, and for a further medical report on
his ability to drive.
If the sheriff, who had previously described Gilchrist as a ''serial
drink driver'', didn't then jail him it would be with a clear
conscience.
Gilchrist, of Bogwood Road, Dalkeith, has five previous convictions
for drink driving and has already been banned for life twice, in 1989
and 1990.
He earlier admitted driving in Edinburgh's Lawnmarket and High Street
on August 2 last year with 232mgs of alcohol in his blood and driving
while disqualified and without insurance.
Sheriff Farrell had deferred sentence until yesterday for a medical
report to confirm that Gilchrist could no longer drive.
Solicitor John Scott said that although he accepted that the doctor
said Gilchrist could still get behind the wheel, the 10 minutes he could
drive for would get shorter and shorter as his condition worsened.
''He is a blighted man in many ways. It would be hard to send him to
prison,'' the sheriff told Mr Scott. He told Gilchrist that it was not
completely impossible for him to drive and that the public had to be
protected.
''The best balance I can strike between regard for the public interest
and compassion for your condition is to defer sentence for six months,''
he said.

A GLASGOW chemist, struck off for misconduct involving drugs that were
widely abused by addicts, failed in his application to be restored to
the pharmaceutical register yesterday.
Pradeep Gajree, of Kintyre Crescent, Newton Mearns, was struck off
following a hearing before the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's statutory
committee in January, 1993.
He had been found guilty of misconduct concerning his inability to
account for the supply of the painkiller Dihydrocodeine (DHC) and
temazepam at his shop in Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow.
Yesterday, chairman Gary Flather, QC, said the committee had
considered numerous matters in coming to their decision not to restore
Mr Gajree, such as whether being struck off for two years was sufficient
to ''mark the gravity of the misconduct'' and the fact that the drugs
concerned were ''controlled and addictive''.
He went on: ''There is an enormous number of pharmacists up and down
the country who conscientiously follow procedures and are diligent in
the control of dangerous drugs. They are trusted by Parliament and by
our society to be so conscientious.''
Another contributing factor, said Mr Flather, was that Mr Gajree's
remorse was in question. ''He himself has never given an explanation or
offered one himself today -- he doesn't have to but it is difficult for
us if he never opens his mouth.''
The application to be restored was made in Mr Gajree's presence by
Miss Mary O'Rourke. ''It is now three years since he first attended
before the committee and he has been off the register for two years. He
has suffered a very humbling experience,'' said Miss O'Rourke.
In a statutory declaration made to the committee, Mr Gajree said he
had sold his pharmacy to his sister-in-law and worked there part-time
for #55 a week. His wife has been forced to work as a supply teacher to
help support their three children.
''He was a well-respected member of the Asian community in Glasgow,
coming from a relatively distinguished family. His brother is a GP and
his sister a dentist. He feels he has brought shame on the family and
community,'' added Miss O'Rourke.
She added that Mr Gajree had been attending several pharmaceutical
lectures and reading all relevant material in a bid to keep himself
abreast of new developments in the profession.
Dismissing the application as ''premature'', Mr Flather said the
committee could not even indicate a time when Mr Gajree should reapply.

ABOUT 300 people protested yesterday against a proposal by Greater
Glasgow Health Board to close the city's Belvidere Hospital.
They gathered at the hospital's gates at the launch of a campaign by
the health union, Unison, against the closure.
The campaigners -- including relatives of patients, and staff -- claim
the hospital is the only one in the area catering for the continuing
care of the elderly and that transferring patients will result in
''unnecessary burdens'' for patients and their relatives.
Mr Jim Devine, Unison's senior health officer in Scotland, claimed
that 8000 of the 10,000 beds for the frail elderly, the physically
disabled and people with learning difficulties were under threat in
Scotland, ''from Shetland to Selkirk''.
Belvidere at present cares for 111 patients and employs 302 staff. Its
catchment area includes much of the east end of Glasgow.
The health board announced last month that it was to seek the
permission of Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to close Belvidere. The
closure is part of the board's plan to cut 500 continuing care beds for
the frail elderly throughout Glasgow between now and April, 1998.
Mr Devine said: ''Neither the local community nor Unison accepts the
health board's decision on Belvidere. Some 99,661 people live in the
east end of Glasgow and 23,643 -- about 25% of the local population --
are at pensionable age.''
He claimed a recent census showed there would be an increasing demand
for long-stay care beds for the elderly, as many people lived longer.
Mr Devine added: ''Belvidere is the only hospital of its kind in the
east end of Glasgow and many of the relatives who visit the present
patients are themselves elderly and can't afford, financially or
physically, to travel outwith the area.''
A health board spokeswoman said the submission to close the hospital
would be made to the Scottish Secretary only after the future location
of the 30 community care beds for the elderly at Belvidere had been
negotiated with the Glasgow Royal Infirmary Trust.

RADICAL changes to bridge the gap in health between rich and poor were
called for yesterday by the King's Fund, a widely respected independent
research group.
The findings, backed by the Government's former chief medical officer,
Sir Donald Acheson, make it harder than ever for the Government to
resist the idea that the widening gap between rich and poor is causing a
chasm in health standards. They affirm observations typified in Glasgow,
where some of the country's healthiest people live side by side with
some of the sickest.
The report -- Tackling Inequalities in Health: An Agenda for Action --
says better access to health care and major changes in economic and
social policies are vital and long overdue.
Sir Donald, who chaired a seminar on the problem for the fund, said:
''The existence of health inequalities in Britain and elsewhere is
indisputable. We hope that future debate will concentrate on
constructive steps to improve the health of the less well off.
''A new political consensus and determination to act are required. Any
successful effort to reduce inequalities in health must look beyond the
NHS and encompass a broad range of actions involving every aspect of
society.''
The report calls for:
* Better housing, partly financed by scrapping mortgage interest tax
relief;
* Restructuring the tax and benefit system to improve the living
standards of the poorest sections of the population;
* Banning tobacco advertising and increasing the ''real'' price of
cigarettes;
* NHS money to be shared out according to need and barriers to health
care for the poor removed;
* Better child care, educational, and employment opportunities for
those in most need.
The report got a lukewarm reception from Mr Gerald Malone, Minister
for Health, who said the Department of Health was committed to improving
health across all parts of the population.
''There can be no doubt that health in this country is steadily
improving in all regions,'' said Mr Malone.
''This is shown by the indicators of infant mortality and death rates.
Between 1981 and 1992, infant mortality rates fell from 11 to 6.5 per
1000. Over the 10 years from 1982 to 1992, life expectancy at birth
increased from 71.8 to 73.8 years for boys and from 77.2 to 79.2 for
girls.''
However, the report points out that death rates at all ages are two to
three times higher among disadvantaged social groups than the more
affluent. Most of the main causes of death contributed to these
differences and as a result the least privileged were likely to die
eight years earlier than the more affluent. They were also more prone to
illness and disability.
What is particularly worrying is that economic inequality appears to
be growing more quickly in Britain than at any time since the Second
World War.
The Secretary of the British Medical Association, Dr Mac Armstrong,
said: ''We have known for some time that how and where you live
determined your chance of a healthy life. Various governments have spent
the past 20 years ignoring the problem -- all the while the inequalities
have been growing.
''If this Government is serious about improving the health of the
nation, it should be doing more to reduce disadvantages in society.''

THE chief executive of Scottish Ballet, Mr Peter Kyle, is to leave the
company at the end of this month, it was announced yesterday.
The news of his departure was released as the company nears the end of
a 10-week tour of a new production of Swan Lake by artistic director
Galina Samsova, which has proved a considerable success with the public,
if not all critics.
The chairman of the board of the company, Lady Dalkeith, said: ''Under
Peter Kyle's leadership, the Scottish Ballet has undergone substantial
development both artistically and commercially and he has been
responsible for securing a strong financial base from which the company
can move forward.''
The members of the company were informed of Mr Kyle's departure in a
letter from Lady Dalkeith yesterday. Two members of the board,
vice-chairman Mrs Oona Ivory and Mr John Moorhouse, also addressed the
company at the New Theatre in Hull.
Mr Kyle was unavailable for comment yesterday. A Scottish Ballet
spokeswoman said he was ''travelling'' but other sources said he had
been at the meeting.
The spokeswoman said there had been a ''mutual agreement'' between Mr
Kyle and the board that he leave. She emphasised that the company was in
a sound condition.
It is understood Mr Kyle has specific interests he now intends to
pursue, and there was some speculation in the dance world that he may
establish his own company to produce more contemporary work than has
been the norm at Scottish Ballet.
The current Swan Lake, which moves to Belfast's Grand Opera House next
week, has been playing to capacity houses and is the first major new
work to be staged by Ms Samsova.
It comes after a revival of the version of The Sleeping Beauty by the
company's founder Peter Darrell which was fiercely criticised.
Mr Kyle is thought to have been promoting a change of direction for
the company away from the large-scale productions favoured by Ms
Samsova, a move which would have had implications for the size of the
company and the number of dancers it employed.
Both Mr Kyle and Ms Samsova are employed by the ballet on a
contractual basis, but the company spokeswoman was unable to say
yesterday whether Mr Kyle would be due a severence payment.
His post of chief executive will not be replaced, however, and a new
post will be advertised when details of it are finalised, she said.
Administrator Mr Chris Denny would take over the day-to-day running of
the company in the interim, but the company's plans were fixed for the
next 18 months.
Doubtless, Mr Kyle's swift departure is by mutual agreement and
doubtless there are other things he is keen to do. But the tick-tack
suggests that his going has more to do with behind-the-scenes schisms
and tensions that have assiduously fermented under wraps until -- as in
the dancers' recent dispute over payment for class -- they make the news
pages.
To a certain extent, some of the problems that haunt Scottish Ballet
have been inherited. Even before Peter Darrell's death in December 1987,
there were troubles aplenty that for the most part, were discussed only
behind closed doors.
After the heyday of the first 10 years, when Scottish Ballet had made
quite a stir with its fresh repertoire, its keen young dancers and its
hard-working touring schedules, inevitably the market trends and
management values of the Thatcherite 80s started to kick in.
The day-to-day running of the company, its costs, its artistic
objectives, its place within the wider servicing of arts and culture
across Scotland all came under scrutiny, with the Scottish Arts Council
commissioning a consultancy report which rigorously questioned every
aspect of Scottish Ballet's existence.
Mr Darrell, weary of fighting the same battles over and over, elected
to stand down as artistic director and 18 months slipped by in a
downward spiral of cancelled productions, reduced touring and rumours of
a shortlist that included Michael Clark and Gelsey Kirkland but never
actually produced a successor. Then, suddenly, Mr Darrell was dead.
Shortly afterwards Peter Kyle arrived to take up the newly created
post of chief executive.
Mr Kyle has ruefully agreed -- courtesy of hindsight -- that not every
decision worked out as he intended. The hasty appointment of Scotish
Ballet's then leading ballerina, Elaine McDonald, as Artist Controller
-- meant to reassure a stunned and grieving company that there would be
some kind of continuity with the past -- precipitated a lurch of crucial
resignations among the old guard. Their misgivings about the
appropriateness of this post -- for her, as much as for the company --
proved correct.
Mere months later, McDonald, with typical dignity and admirable
reticence, quit the company she had loyally served, and been widely
identified with, for 21 years.
There then followed what one might call the patchwork interregnum.
Various guest directors were invited in to extend the company's
technical range and repertoire.
Perhaps Peter Kyle's departure so abruptly after seven years signals
something other than a yen for fresh pastures. Perhaps he senses that,
yet again, a speculative eye is being cast by funding bodies who are
having to meet strong demands from other sectors of the dance community.
If flack is to fly, by the end of this week, he will be out of direct
range.

A FORMER public school headmaster found guilty of thrashing pupils has
a new job -- promoting holidays as laird of a Scottish manor.
Kevin Booth, 34, was given a suspended three-month sentence last year
after admitting four charges of common assault on two girls and two boys
aged between 11 and 13, foreign students at Booth's school in
Northumberland.
Newcastle Crown Court heard how Booth, a father of three, beat
children on the bottom with a horse whip, ruler, and bamboo cane.
While awaiting trial, Booth went into business as a horse racing
tipster with partner Jim Dale. The two men bought the laird's title and
hunting lodge at Lochdhu, Caithness.
Now Booth is inviting parties of up to 14 tourists to pay #1595 a week
to hire the 100-year-old lodge, which is ideal for shooting and fishing
trips.

TWO lorry drivers helped police in a dramatic high-speed chase on a
Scots motorway by ''boxing in'' a car that was travelling at speeds of
more than 100mph and forcing it to stop.
The late-night drama happened on the M74 as seven police cars from two
different forces pursued two cars in a 60-mile chase north from the
Border.
One of the cars -- a Vauxhall Astra -- crashed just north of Abington.
The other -- a Toyota Supra -- was eventually stopped by the truckers
near Canderside Toll.
Dumfries and Galloway traffic police began the chase at the Border.
They alerted Strathclyde police to look out for the two cars, believed
to have been travelling at speeds of more than 130mph on some stretches
of the road.
Last night, police praised the action of the lorry drivers.
A Strathclyde police spokesman said: ''Their actions helped bring this
incident to a safe conclusion. It is a good example of the public
helping police. They seemed to realise right away what was happening and
decided to help.''
He said police do not know the identity of the drivers: ''As far as we
know they just forced this car to stop and then continued on their way
as if nothing had happened.''.
One of the articulated lorries sat in front of the car while the other
came up on the outside, preventing it from overtaking the first lorry
while police followed behind.
There were no injuries during the high-speed drama.
Police say four men -- all from the Rutherglen and Cambuslang areas in
Glasgow -- are helping them in their inquiries into alleged car thefts
in the Carlisle area.

COUNTERFEIT bank notes with a face value of more than #18m, #12m of it
in sterling, were seized by police yesterday when they raided a lock-up
garage.
It was the biggest ever single seizure of fake sterling.
The team of five detectives from South East Regional Crime Squad
discovered eight large boxes packed with counterfeit cash -- including
fake #50 notes and US$100 bills -- at the garage in Coborn Road, Bow,
east London.
A spokeswoman for the squad said one man had been arrested in
connection with the incident.
The #6m in dollars was among the largest seizure of American currency
in the UK.
Police believe the fake cash was being stored ready for distribution
-- and are confident they have smashed a counterfeit operation that has
been running for at least two years.
The spokeswoman added: ''It is very good news that we were able to
keep this fake money off the streets before it got into circulation.''
Police are appealing for information about the garage.
The seizure equals the total amount taken by police nationwide in the
whole of 1993, and trebles the total figure of #6m for 1992.
* In April 1994, police in Islington, north London, seized #13m in
counterfeit money in various currencies.
The presses at the printing works they raided were producing #6m of
fake British cash. Four men were arrested.
Other significant hauls include #5m seized on a trading estate in
Edmonton, north London, in January 1993, and #2m taken from a north
London printing works two months later.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang was told last night, at a private meeting
of his back benchers, that unless the chairman and chief executive of
Scottish Nuclear keep their jobs in a privatisation plan, he will have
small chance of selling it in Scotland.
Mr Lang spent an hour with Scottish Tory back benchers in his room at
the Commons, and all but 15 minutes was devoted to the privatisation of
the nuclear industry.
He had already promised the Commons that there would be a distinct
Scottish entity. ''I am happy to give that assurance,'' he said at
Scottish Questions when pressed on the issue by Labour.
Mr Lang did not reveal to his back benchers the details of his game
plan for a Cabinet decision, which may not now be taken for three weeks.
The Government is planning a White Paper and a statement on its
decision. This is unlikely to come before the English local elections
next Thursday.
All privatisation options were reviewed at the meeting last night, and
it was emerging that the only feasible plan for privatisation was that
Scottish Nuclear -- with its two nuclear plants -- and the six Nuclear
Electric plants south of the Border, should be sold as a single entity.
The parent company is likely to be based in Scotland, if Mr Lang has his
way.
At the East Kilbride plant there is, ready and waiting, a building
that could house a holding company for both Scottish and English
management. But this would have to be ''ring-fenced'' so that, after
privatisation, the new owners could not reverse such a decision and
remove the headquarters to England.
Edinburgh, as the nation's capital and financial centre, is still the
favoured possibility for the holding company of the privatised
operation.
Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, yesterday
wrote to Mr Lang demanding specific answers to underwrite his pledge
that there would be a distinct Scottish entity to privatisation.
When the Cabinet's final decision is taken, with the publication of a
White Paper setting out in detail how nuclear privatisation is to be
achieved, Mr Lang faces a stiff political task.
He was left in no doubt by Scottish Tory back benchers that Scottish
Nuclear chairman, Mr James Hann, and chief executive, Mr Robin Jeffrey
-- both keen on privatisation -- must be kept in place in any new
Scottish/English privatised company. Without such assurance, Mr Lang's
political problems would be almost insurmountable.
Scottish Office officials insisted that consumers north of the Border
would not miss out on sweeteners in the form of cheaper bills as part of
any privatisation of the nuclear electricity industry. Sources insisted
that Scotland was already ahead of England and Wales in terms of
benefits to the consumer, and that there could be more to come.
Meanwhile, under intense pressure in the Commons during the hour-long
session of Scottish question time, Mr Lang insisted he was concerned
about securing ''the best long-term future in Scotland for the Scottish
nuclear industry'', and he accused the opposition parties of
scaremongering.
Challenged by Labour MP for East Lothian, Mr John Home-Robertson, on
whether Scottish Nuclear would remain a distinct Scottish entity. Mr
Lang said he was ''happy to give that assurance'', although in other
exchanges he made clear that the final package still had to be decided.
Mr Robertson said the possible merger and sell-off of Scottish Nuclear
made no sense and that Scottish Nuclear should stay ''firmly and
permanently'' in the public sector.
He said that what was happening was ''nuclear madness'', and argued
that Mr Lang was the victim of another ''panic-stricken, money-grabbing
tactic by the Treasury''. Mr Lang, he said, had been out-voted,
out-argued, and out-gunned in Cabinet.
Mr Lang retorted: ''What we are concerned to secure is the long-term
future of the industry, and I do not believe that the policy of your
party could ever deliver that.
''I anticipate that the number of jobs will, over time, expand in
Scotland if we can secure the right package for the future of this
industry.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond asked Mr Lang: ''Will you now answer the
question? Are you personally in favour, as press reports suggest, of a
merger of Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric before privatisation?''
If this was so, he said, no-one outside the Scottish Office shared
that opinion, and he wondered what had changed since the 1980s, when it
was decided to leave Scottish Nuclear under Scottish control, and public
control.

<HEADLINE>Hospital checks after woman's TB claim</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A WOMAN claims she caught tuberculosis during surgery in a regional
hospital.
Health authorities, who say the possibilities of this happening are
remote, are now recommending that special additional precautions be
taken at all operations at the hospital.
The 50-year-old woman was one of 26 patients recalled for checks after
a man was diagnosed as having TB several weeks after surgery at Dumfries
Infirmary. He later died but not of the disease.
The anaesthetic apparatus in his case was used in other operations
between November 15 and December 12 last year.
Doctors were concerned that the TB bacterium could have got into
vapours in the machine and passed to other patients. However, they said
the risk was ''extremely low''.
Of those recalled, 25 were given the all-clear but a chest X-ray
confirmed that the woman, who lives in the Annan area of Dumfriesshire,
had the disease.
She has asked not be identified and she and her husband are taking
legal advice.
Dr David Breen, a community health specialist with Dumfries and
Galloway Health Board, said yesterday: ''The woman is having treatment
for TB. We do not know whether the disease can be attributed to the
anaesthetic apparatus.
''To determine this, the patient would have to have invasive tests,
which in her case are clinically inappropriate because of her ill
health.''
He added: ''If she did catch the disease from the anaesthetic
apparatus, it would be the first known instance. There is no reported
case.''
Dr Breen said the area Control of Infection Committee had recommended
that a filter be fitted to anaestheic machines for all operations in
Dumfries and Galloway and this would be done.
He added: ''This is standard practice where there is a known risk. But
it was not known that the man had TB at the time of his operation and a
filter was not used.
''Filters will now be fitted to the apparatus for all operations in
this region at a cost of about #45,000 a year. This is already done in
some other hospitals.''
A spokesman for the NHS trust which runs the hospital said it would
follow the advice of the Control of Infections Committee.

A FISHERY protection vessel was on its way early this morning to
investigate a ''very close encounter'' involving a Scottish trawler and
two Spanish fishing boats.
The incident took place 35 miles north-west of the Butt of Lewis in
the Hebrides.
A coastguard helicopter was scrambled to film the incident after the
skipper of the Inverness-registered Cameo reported ''a clash'' about 4pm
yesterday with one of two Spanish vessels.
Stornoway coastguard reported it as a ''minor skirmish'' and said
there was no collision or injury. ''From what we can gather, they were
wanting to fish in the same place,'' a spokeswoman said.
A statement issued by the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency
confirmed an incident had occurred involving two Spanish long-liners,
the Goitia and the Pilar Roca, and the Cameo.
The spokesman said the fisheries protection vessel which had been
patrolling in the area had been ordered to attend but was not expected
to reach the vessels until 6am today because of adverse weather
conditions.
Mr Hugh Allan, secretary of Mallaig and North West Fishermen's
Association, said last night: ''The Spanish vessel was within 10 metres
of the Cameo, which is unprofessionally close.''
He said the Cameo was skippered by Mr Willie Jack, of Avoch, near
Inverness, and fished out of Lochinver.
No-one from the Cameo which has a crew of five, could be reached for
comment last night.

NINETEEN out of 20 independent economists polled by Reuters expect
Britain to raise its interest rates after next week's meeting between
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George.
The weakness of sterling and the strength of the economy leave the two
men with no serious option to sanctioning a half-point rise in base
rates to 7.25% when they meet tomorrow week, the morning after the local
elections in England and Wales.
There was strong support yesterday for dearer money from the Institute
of Directors. Its director-general, Tim Melville-Ross, told a BBC radio
audience, ''There are two evils. One is higher interest rates, the other
is higher inflation, and businesses all the way along the line will say
'let's have higher interest rates if we have to in order to avoid
returning to the kind of inflationary environment we had in the past'.
''That is not to say the conditions now are necessarily right for an
interest rate increase. All I am saying is that if it has to be, that is
the lesser of two evils.''
Eighteen of the economists in the survey are betting on a half-point
rise in rates. One expects just 0.25%.
The near unanimity of independent economists is no great surprise.
More significant is that 11, a bare majority, expect at least one
further half-point rise by the end of the year after an increase in May.
Sterling made some headway yesterday on the back of the G7 meeting.
Its trade-weighted index jumped from 84.1 to 84.7, but has still lost
4.3% of its value this year.

JOHN FUZHARD reckons that half of all Britain's businesses are paying
too much VAT. He also thinks the VAT man will be knocking on more
company doors this year and the result could be soaring bills.
John is a former senior VAT inspector and estimates he got ''gross
additional liability'' from four out of five companies he visited. Put
bluntly, he increased most companies' VAT bills.
Ten years ago John switched sides, and is now recognised as a leading
VAT expert. Which is why earlier this year Arthur Anderson headhunted
him to become its senior VAT manager in Scotland.
John points out the ominous fact that the Customs and Excise is now
run along company lines, and that its management plan for 1994/95 to
1996/97 says: ''. . . during 1994/95 we expect to discover #1700m net
additional liability.''
The problem, says John, is that the Customs and Excise do not try to
discover if a company is paying too much VAT.
Says John: ''It is not too far-fetched to say that 50% of businesses
are paying more VAT than they need to. As a VAT adviser John has saved
companies millions of pounds.
''Probably the smallest I have dealt with is a company with a #250,000
annual turnover and I saved them #80,000, but I have also saved larger
companies sums of up to #2m.''

FAT cat bosses were defended yesterday, perhaps not surprisingly, by
Lord Young, President of the Institute of Directors and himself
executive chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless where last year he earned a total
of #948,536. This included a performance-related bonus of #322,695 and a
contribution to his pension of #171,373.
Speaking at the Institute of Directors' annual convention in London
yesterday Lord Young dismissed the recent controversy over telephone
number salaries and the high profile campaign over exceutive pay run by
the Labour Party with the words ''what nonsense''.
He said ''enterprise is not greed'' but the legitimate desire ''to
better your lot and that of your family and when that happens society
around you must benefit as well''. There will be many people who would
disagree with that premise. However Lord Young said that if the spirit
of enterprise was forgotten then ''we are doomed to decades of
decline''.
Lord Young stoutly defended the privatistaion programme of the Tories,
in which he particated as Trade and Industry minister. He said it was
enterprise that had transformed nationalised industries, such as British
Airways, British Leyland and British Telecom.
''Let's not knock privatisation'' he said adding, ''it has created the
enterprise that has transformed our economy and our lives and is
sweeping the world''.
Lord Young's remuneration perhaps can be justified by the fact that
Cable &amp; Wireless is a successful international telecommunications
company with operations in over 50 countries. In the opinion of Michael
Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, there are not enough of such
world-class UK companies.
Although 16 of the 25 most profitable companies in Europe are British,
there are still thought to be too many poorly-performing firms. Mr
Heseltine drew attention to the fact that Britain continues to lose
market share in its top 80 markets.
Contrary to popular opinion this market share is not being lost to
low-cost producers in the Far East but from high-cost, well-paid Western
European, North American and Japanese companies.
''In far too many of the 80 markets it is not the UK which has the
largest share, but Germany,'' he said. He added that the best of our
companies were the equal of anything to be found in Germany but that too
many of our companies were not. ''It is averages that count and the UK
has a long tail of under-achievers,'' he said.
He drew attention to the fact that competition is increasing all the
time and that companies will need to respond instantly to changing
global demand. Under Mr Heseltine's stewardship at the Department of
Trade and Industry clear priorities have been identified and acted upon.
One of these has been to give a real focus and meaning to the role of
government industrial sponsorship. Increased emphasis has been placed on
boosting exports and the competitiveness of British industry.
Named officials within the DTI have been assigned to boost exports in
each of the UK's top 80 markets. To help improve the department's
performance in both sponsorship and exports private sector expertise has
been drafted in. There are currently over 120 secondees from industry
working in these areas. Next month the Government will publish a White
Paper on competitiveness, reviewing progress to date.

BANK of Scotland celebrated its 300th anniversary with an increase in
operating profits which the English clearers failed to achieve and
posted record annual pre-tax earnings of #450m, an increase of
two-thirds on the previous year.
The bank also dampened speculation that it was set to join the
scramble for a UK building society in the week Abbey National announced
its interest in National &amp; Provincial.
In spite of the stagnant housing market, the bank's mortgage business
is buoyant. The group's lending margins showed an overall improvement.
The bank, a bastion of Caledonian conservatism, reduced bad debt
charges by less than its competitors in its year to end-February. It
believes this cautious approach gives it more potential to boost
earnings in the short-term.
However, the question of the quality of Bank of Scotland's lending
south of the Border was raised by some City analysts who considered its
bad debt charge of #222m, only 29% lower than the previous year, to be
high.
Bank of Scotland increased its total dividend by 15% to 5.82p, after a
final payout of 3.69p. The shares, which initially lost ground, ended 1p
higher at 220p to give a yield of 3.3%. The results were in the middle
of City expectations.
Although the distribution was covered nearly four times, a relatively
high level, the 15% hike comes after an increase of about 10% the
previous year and about 5% in the 12 months to end-February 1993.
Governor Sir Bruce Pattullo said: ''What particularly pleases me is
that we are seeing the operating profit up 14% (to #650m), when the
London banks were all down 10% at the operating level. That is quite a
disparity.
''It shows that we are continuing to drive the business forward.''
However, with Bank of Scotland alone in growing its share of the
lending market, there is naturally some suspicion about the quality of
its increasing loan book furth of Scotland.
There is something of a feeling in the City that there is a Jekyll and
Hyde split between Bank of Scotland's corporate borrowers in Scotland
and England.
But the bank enjoys the reputation of looking carefully at cash flow
and finance issues when funding the purchase of assets or management
buy-outs for clients who tend to have poor credit ratings.
Broker BZW has done a lot of research into the credit quality of UK
banks' corporate loan books.
Its banking analyst, Hugh Pye, said: ''I think people have a
justifiable feeling of caution that they are putting on a lot of lending
when other banks aren't and that some of this might be poor quality.
''However, I do think they are good lenders and that they have high
quality lending managers.''
Advances to borrowers rose 10% to #24.8bn. Bank of Scotland's sterling
lending portfolio grew 7% to #15.8bn, with its mortgage book increasing
a healthy 11% to #6000m. Currency lending rose 18% to $6000m.
Referring to the rise in home loans, Hugh Young, the bank's general
manager and secretary, said: ''I think it is true that the housing
market has been very stagnant. If we can do new business in a stagnant
period then, assuming some improvement in the housing market, that is
quite encouraging.''
Overall, net interest earnings grew 16% to #900m, with the margin
increasing from 2.59% to 2.77%.
However, Bank of Scotland said competitive pressures, taken with the
recent increases in base rates, meant loan margins were again under
pressure as other lenders sought to recover lost market shares.
Bank of Scotland's key cost-income ratio rose from 48.6% to 49.8%,
although virtually all of this was the result of increased payments to
staff under profit-sharing schemes because of the group's improved
performance.
Returning to the possibility of Bank of Scotland following Lloyds and
Abbey's moves to acquire building societies, Sir Bruce said: ''We've
looked and listened and watched. We've talked to one or two but at the
moment we're ambivalent. We're unconvinced.''
Pre-tax profits earned by the clearing bank itself rose 76% to #296m.
The second greatest contribution came from Chester-based instalment
credit subsidiary NWS Bank, which rose 48% to #114m.
British Linen Bank Group, the Edinburgh-based merchant banking
subsidiary, raised profits by 22% to #13.2m, while factoring division
Kellock increased earnings by 75% to #4.2m.
Countrywide Banking Corporation, the New Zealand subsidiary, raised
its contribution by 44% to #21.6m. Bank of Wales turned a #4.8m loss
into an #800,000 profit.
A #20m one-off gain resulted from the realignment of subsidiaries'
year-ends, although this was offset by a prudent #20m increase in Bank
of Scotland's general provision for bad and doubtful debts.
Bank of Scotland also received a special dividend of #10.9m from the
3i investment capital group.
Broker BZW expects pre-tax profits to edge above #500m in the current
financial year and is looking for a further fall in the bad debt charge
to about #185m.
It rates the stock a ''strong hold'' but may move to a buy stance, as
it sees value in the longer-term.
Although it expects to continue cutting bad debt charges in the
near-term, Bank of Scotland believes the future norm for provisions will
be higher than that of the past.
It cited increasing competition in industry and commerce and the
shorter life-cycles of companies, partly the result of technological
advances, as reasons for this.

HISTORIC papers belonging to Sir Winston Churchill, including the
notes for his great wartime speeches, were secured for the nation
yesterday with a more than #13m grant from the National Lottery.
The bulk of the money, #12.5m will be used to buy the collection from
the Churchill family, which includes his grandsons Tory MPs Winston
Churchill and Defence Minister Nicholas Soames.
There was concern last night that this could set a precedent for Prime
Ministers' public papers to be sold by their relatives rather than
donated to the nation.
However, the decision to use money from the lottery to pay the family
was strongly defended by National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell,
who rejected any suggestion of an ''establishment stitch-up''.
''I think there can be no better way to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of VE-Day than to have the assurance that all Sir Winston Churchill's
papers are secure in one place, available in perpetuity to scholars and
the public alike,'' he told Channel 4 News.
He said the collection included many private papers and that the legal
wrangling to determine which were private and which were state documents
could have gone on for years if this settlement had not been reached.
The purchase, however, was strongly condemned by some Labour MPs who
said that the Heritage Lottery Fund should be helping projects which
benefit ordinary people.
Mr Dennis Canavan, Labour MP for Falkirk West, said: ''I would have
thought there were other priorities for spending more than #13m of the
National Lottery Fund.''
Mr Jeremy Corbyn, Labour MP for Islington North, said: ''These papers
are only the product of the fact that he was Prime Minister during the
war years, and they should be part of the national archive anyway.
''The National Lottery money ought to be used to improve artistic,
sporting, and cultural life for ordinary people in this country.''
The grant goes to the newly-formed Sir Winston Churchill Archive Trust
at Cambridge University, which will hold the vast collection of
1,500,000 pre-1945 papers.
The chairman of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Lord Rothschild,
said that if the trust had not been able to buy it, the collection may
well have been broken up and sold abroad.
He insisted the Churchill family had agreed a favourable rate to
ensure the papers remained together and stayed in Britain.
''It's fair to say that the Churchill trustees and the family involved
have behaved very generously,'' he said. ''The purchase price that we
eventually negotiated is a rather favourable one.''
He was unable to put a figure on its value in the open market but it
could easily have been double the agreed price arrived at after long
negotiations and independent valuation.
The trust already holds Sir Winston's post-1945 papers, which were
donated to Churchill College by Lady Spencer-Churchill on behalf of the
family, and his papers will now, therefore, form a single collection.
Lord Rothschild said that if they had been dispersed ''everyone in the
country would have minded dreadfully''.
He said: ''It's surely in the same category of national importance for
us, as the Declaration of Independence for the people of the US.''
The donation was the biggest single grant by the Heritage Lottery
Fund, accounting for more than half its first series of pay-outs of
#25m.
The fund is contributing a total of #13,250,000 for Sir Winston's
pre-1945 papers, with a further #1m donation from American
philanthropist John Paul Getty.
For #12.5m the trust acquires its interest in the papers from the
Churchill Archive Settlement, established by Sir Winston in 1946.
The lottery fund will also provide #1m for an endowment to care for
the archive, and #750,000 for development costs, including exhibition
and conservation.
The vast collection of papers includes original drafts of his most
famous speeches, including ''We shall fight them on the beaches'' and
''This was their finest hour''.
There are also many private papers, such as the politician's
tear-stained letters to his mother as a homesick schoolboy, letters from
every sovereign from Edward VII to the Queen, and from every premier
from Lord Salisbury to Lord Home.
0   Meanwhile, Scottish European Aid, one of the largest Scottish
charities operating abroad, last night condemned the #13m grant and said
just a fraction of that amount could be used to help thousands of people
in some of the countries where its staff work, such as Bosnia and
Romania.

IN a surprise move, Grampian Health Board announced yesterday that it
had been told by the Scottish Office to invite open competition for the
future provision of hospital services in Stonehaven.
Last night, the Scottish Office denied that asking for private sector
bids to provide a complete hospital service in the town was a move
towards privatisation of the NHS.
Mr John McAllion, Labour's health spokesman, said he believed that it
was another step towards the privatisation of the NHS and that it could
lead to the erosion of wages and conditions for the health staff.
He said that, under the Government's Private Finance Initiative, this
could possibly become the site of the first privately-built hospital in
Scotland, which could then be leased back to the NHS with the pay-off
for the developers being the contract to run the services.
The health board announcement came as a response to proposals
submitted to the Scottish Office by Grampian Healthcare last year.
Grampian Healthcare, Scotland's largest NHS trust, proposed, in their
business plan published one year ago, to consider the future provision
of services in the town.
Grampian Health Board agreed to carry out a detailed investigation of
all possible options. A group was established to examine everything from
the status quo to a completely new hospital on a new site. It consulted
all sections of the community.
The hospital services involved are GP acute beds, NHS long-stay beds
for elderly people who require clinical care, and all the associated
services for people in North Kincardine and most of South Kincardine.
Their preferred option was to dispose of the existing Woodcot Hospital
and build a completely new hospital on the site of the existing Arduthie
Hospital.
They submitted this recommendation, along with the information about
other options they had considered to the Scottish Office last autumn.
It had been widely expected that, following the wide consultation
exercise, the Scottish Office would simply rubber stamp this proposal.
Instead, the Scottish Office NHS Management Executive told Grampian
Health Board to invite open competition.
The board has to draw up a detailed specification of the services
which it wishes to purchase in Stonehaven. Organisations will then be
invited to indicate how they would provide these services.
A health board spokeswoman said those tendering would have to indicate
where they would provide the services and it would be up to them whether
or not it was in the existing hospitals. The contract will be open to
Grampian Healthcare, other NHS trusts, and the private sector.
Mr Frank Hartnett, the health board's general manager, said: ''It is
expected that this process of open competition will result in new and
imaginative suggestions which will bring benefits to the patients and
value for money for the taxpayer.''
Grampian Healthcare last night gave a cautious welcome to the
announcement. ''If open competition is necessary, this trust will
respond vigorously to the challenge,'' said Mr Jeremy Taylor, the
trust's chief executive.
Last night, the Scottish Office dismissed the suggestion from Mr
McAllion that this was another step towards privatisation of the NHS.
''We are always keen to encourage innovative approaches to the
purchase and delivery of healthcare which will result in better access,
services, and outcomes for patients. The board is right to explore all
the options open to it.
''Whatever the shape of the NHS services that emerge for Stonehaven at
the end of the day -- and that is a matter for the health board as
purchaser -- they will remain free at the point of delivery to all those
who may come to need them.''

THE Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police is to be sued for damages by
an Asian man for an alleged racist attack by police officers in Glasgow
more than three years ago.
A civil action raised by Mr Aamer Anwar, a freelance journalist, will
begin at Glasgow Sheriff Court today.
He was one of several students from Glasgow University who were
fly-posting in November 1991 in the West End for a demonstration by the
National Union of Students when he was allegedly dragged from the group
by police officers and thrown to the ground.
Mr Anwar, who was President of the Asian Students Society at the time,
claims he was struck repeatedly until he lost consciousness and then
''dumped'' at a hospital by the police. He further claims he now suffers
recurring nightmares and panic attacks.

HIGH petrol prices could be slashed in the Western Isles if the local
authority goes ahead with a plan to bulk-buy petrol and undercut local
garages.
Western Isles Islands Council yesterday considered a proposal to deal
with major suppliers.
At an environmental services meeting in Stornoway, councillors were
told that islanders paid 30p more a gallon than consumers on the
mainland.
Councillors heard that in the past the high price had been blamed on
shipping costs: this was dismissed. It was estimated the shipping charge
was around 1p a gallon.
Chief executive Brian Stewart said he would investigate the idea of
bulk buying and a report would be considered at the next council
meeting.

THE hush which fell across Britain on the 11th hour of the 11th day of
the 11th month to mark the anniversary of the Armistice which ended the
First World War is set to unite the nation again on a spring evening at
8.38.
The Royal British Legion wants the unlikely time on VE-night on May 8
to mark the return of the old-style two-minutes' silence which once saw
virtually everything stop, including traffic.
It had been spurred to mount its campaign for the gesture so Britain
could honour its war heroes after the past 30 years had seen the
tradition ebb away, with the silence kept only at the Remembrance Day
service at the Cenotaph and other religious ceremonies.
Yesterday, the campaign received the backing of the Prime Minister,
who expressed his support for a national two-minute tribute on VE-night,
the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe.
Mr Major said he hoped everyone who could do so would join in the
silence ''in solemn remembrance of those who made possible victory in
Europe 50 years ago''.
War veterans wanted the act of remembrance observed in the two minutes
before the Queen lights the first commemoration beacon in Hyde Park at
8.40pm on May 8.
In a statement issued by Downing Street, Mr Major said: ''At 8.38pm on
May 8, the nation has an opportunity to unite in solemn remembrance of
those who made possible victory in Europe 50 years ago.'' Mr Major said
the VE-day event in Hyde Park would include the two-minute period.
Labour leader Tony Blair and Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown
have signalled their support for a solemn act of remembrance.
Last night, both BBC and STV said they would be screening live VE
programmes which would carry the two-minute silence observed at Hyde
Park.
Sky is due to show the Premiership clash between Blackburn Rovers and
Newcastle United, with the kick-off scheduled for 8pm. A Sky spokesman
said it would consult the Premier League and would be happy for the
match to start earlier so the silence could be observed at half-time, or
later, so fans could pay their respects before kick-off.
British Rail said it would ask its 25 train operators to request
station announcers to observe the silence. A BR spokesman said
announcers would state: ''There will now be a two-minute silence.''
The news was welcomed as ''absolutely marvellous'' by Mr Terry
English, the Royal British Legion's national controller.
Flight Lieutenant John Nichol, shot down during the Gulf war and held
as a prisoner by the Iraqis, also welcomed the Prime Minister's
announcement.

<HEADLINE>Safety licence could sink Devonport    Trident resurfaces for Rosyth</HEADLINE>

ROSYTH seems set to re-inherit the #5000m contract for refit work on
the Royal Navy's Trident submarine fleet because its Devonport rival
cannot obtain a safety licence from the Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate.
The Fife yard is on target to meet the inspectorate's full
requirements by September this year, and already has an emergency berth
for the first of the Trident boats, HMS Vanguard, which could be
available at 36 hours' notice.
It is also likely that it will continue to refit the Navy's
hunter-killer nuclear submarines. Work on these was due to be
discontinued at the end of next year.
Devonport has reportedly encountered virtually insoluble safety
problems caused by the unstable limestone rock formation on which it
stands. It also lacks a low-level nuclear waste reprocessor to deal with
spent reactor fuel. Despite major efforts to overcome the difficulty by
installing a huge concrete drydock case and seismic stabilisers, the
yard has yet to receive even a partial nuclear licence.
Rosyth already has a partial safety licence for Trident. The yard is
built on solid bedrock, and has installed seismic arrestor blocks to
hold submarines in place during the refitting process.
A Devonport Dockyard spokesman last night dismissed claims that the
Trident deal was in jeopardy. He said: ''The proposals to use the former
battleship docks meet all the criteria needed for Trident refits. That
includes the requirement to be able to withstand an earthquake. We must
stress that there are no problems with the docks structure.
''Our negotiations with the Government and the Defence Ministry are in
their final phase. We are also upgrading the caissons, the concrete
blocks which seal each end of the submarine dry-docks to meet NII
requirements.''
A dockyard union source said there were 30,000 jobs involved. ''There
have been problems, but they are being addressed. Any claim to the
contrary would appear to be an attempt to de-rail Devonport and gain
revenge for Rosyth.''
However, industry sources said last night it was possible a licence
would never be granted, and that it was unlikely Devonport would pass
even the minimum safety requirements to allow its workforce to carry out
the normal two-year refit of the hunter-killer fleet.
Rosyth has two of these Swiftsure-class boats, HMS Sovereign and HMS
Superb, in docks at the moment. Superb was due to be the last dealt with
in Scotland under last year's Defence Ministry decision to rationalise
its submarine and surface warship refit programme.
She was due to return to patrol duties in 1996 after a #100m overhaul.
The next submarine was to go to Devonport. The sop to Rosyth was the
promise of refit work on surface warships.
Rumours that Rosyth might win more submarine contracts by default have
been circulating for weeks. Mr Alan Smith, the chairman of Babcock
Defence Ltd, the yard's operator, is understood to be flying to London
early next week for a meeting with senior Ministry officials to clarify
the position.
''We have had no official word from the Defence Ministry on any future
submarine work,'' he said. ''Our plans must, for the moment, be based on
what we know to be secure. That involves dealing with surface warship
contracts once our current submarine refits have been completed.''
The Ministry said: ''There have been problems, but as far as we are
concerned, the refit programme is still on track. Superb is due to come
out of refit next year. After that, according to the schedule, submarine
refits will go to Devonport. That should begin in 1998.''
Submarine refits involve upgrading equipment and replacement of the
nuclear fuel rods in the boat's reactor. For safety, this has to be
carried out in a drydock fitted with huge concrete doors. The submarine
itself sits on the equivalent of giant shock absorbers in case of
earthquake or other major ground tremors.
An engineer explained: ''Replacing the fuel rods means cutting a hole
in the boat's hull. If water were to enter the reactor compartment as a
result of seismic interference or the failure of dock gates during this
process, there would be a potentially catastrohpic explosion which would
contaminate the surrounding area and produce a cloud of radioactive
gas.''
