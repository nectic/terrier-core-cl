NEW DELHI: Indian officials said yesterday secret talks to free two
Britons and two other Westerners held captive by guerrillas in Kashmir
continued but were unsure if negotiations would bring a peaceful end to
the 10-week crisis. ''Contact was there on Tuesday evening but there is
nothing significant,'' said an official of the Kashmir government who
asked not to be identified. He said intermediaries indicated the
hostages were safe.

WASHINGTON: The US tobacco industry increased its donations to the
Republican Party fivefold in the first half of 1995 as Washington
threatened stricter regulations, the New York Times reported yesterday.
The paper said the industry has given the national Republican Party,
which has a majority in both the House and Senate, more than #1m in the
first half of 1995. Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco, and Brown &amp; Williamson,
a subsidiary of BAT Industries Plc, accounted for the lion's share.

WASHINGTON: Tropical Storm Marilyn, the 13th named storm of the
prolific 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed off the Windward
Islands. A tropical storm warning, alerting residents to imminent storm
conditions, was issued for Barbados and storm watches were in effect for
St Vincent and the Grenadines, St Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago. Hurricane
Luis lashed the Caribbean with 140mph winds last week.

BEIJING: More than 200 people fell down open manholes in Beijing last
year after thieves stole the manhole covers, it was reported yesterday.
About 2000 manhole covers in the streets of the Chinese capital were
stolen in 1994, probably beccause a 132lb lid can sell for more than #8,
the Economic Daily newspaper said said. The casualties included
pedestrians and cyclists.

BEIRUT: The Lebanese government has decided to allow a hunting season
after all, rebuffing an appeal by former French film star Brigitte
Bardot to stop what she called indiscriminate massacre by trigger-happy
Lebanese. The gun lobby said Bardot would do better to try to stop
hunting in France which had 3.6 million hunters compared with Lebanon's
30,000 and less restrictions on species they can shoot.

protest at a plan to downgrade their profession as part of efforts to
cut losses at the state-owned airline. Despite the strike's large
following, Air France said traffic remained normal, with all long-haul

WIDER still and wider shall the bounds of the PGA European Tour be
set. Announcing an interim programme for 1996, executive director Ken
Schofield said yesterday that the season would start in Singapore, move
to Perth, Australia, and then to South Africa for at least two weeks.
Schofield added: ''The start of the schedule reflects our desire to
provide tournament competition on the finest available courses in the
most favourable conditions. I am optimistic that, when we finalise the
programme, there will be advances in all major areas.'' In 1995,
prize-money on the regular, challenge, and senior tours amounted to some
#30m.
One course new to the circuit, as already announced, is Loch Lomond,
where the inaugural World Invitational will be played from September 19
to 22. The first event in Britain will, as usual, be The Benson and
Hedges International Open on May 16 to 19. It is moving from St Mellion
in Cornwall to The Oxfordshire, near Thame.
Ken Hunt, general manager at St Mellion, said: ''The break from
tournament golf will allow us to complete a #1m investment in our
facilities.'' The Oxfordshire, opened two years ago, has already staged
a European women's tour event.
* THE Berkshire's Angela Uzielli snatched victory from Canadian
visitor Diane Williams at the first extra play-off hole in the Senior

CELTIC yesterday completed an exhausting journey to the Black Sea
resort town of Batumi in Georgia -- just in time to beat the UEFA
24-hour deadline before their European Cup-winners' Cup tie against the
local side this afternoon.
The journey, which began in Glasgow on Tuesday, necessitated a flight
to Turkey and an overnight stay in Istanbul, and yesterday the final
stage was completed with another three-hour air journey across the Black
Sea and into the unknown.
The Celtic party faced a further delay of almost two hours when the
plane touched down on Georgian soil. It took officials that long to
process all the visas, despite the fact that the Celtic flight was the
only one at the airport at the time.
Having already been well warned by Parkhead security chief, George
Douglas, about the dangers which could be faced in this poverty-stricken
region of eastern Europe -- he advised that even visits to the town
centre should be avoided -- the party went straight to their hotel.
Afterwards, manager Tommy Burns took the players training in 80[DEG]F
heat, and several hundred of the locals watched as he put them through
their paces.
Burns, facing his first European game as a manager, is waiting for a
fitness test on left back Tosh McKinlay, who has a back injury, before
naming his side.
The team's accommodation in Batumi, the Sputnik Hotel, is basic to say
the least, and is located in a depressing, run-down ghetto of a place
where, almost without exception, every building is in a state of
disrepair.
Despite the social problems in the fledgling nation which gained
independence from the Soviet Union only fours years ago, football
remains a passion and a welcome diversion for the Georgians from their
daily traumas.
This is reflected by an incentive on offer to the Batumi players to
reach the next round.
The squad's average wage is only around #350 a month, but they are
reputedly in line for a #3500 bonus if they knock out Celtic.

Steaua Bucharest 1, Rangers 0
A SPECTACULAR late goal by Daniel Prodan punished Rangers on a tense
and traumatic evening throughout which they lived dangerously close to
the edge.
Even Prodan admitted it was ''the most beautiful goal I've ever scored
and also the most important of my entire career.''
His strike late in the match was indeed a thing of wondrous beauty.
Rangers had allowed themselves to be pushed back for lengthy periods
and it was perhaps inevitable a defensive system, which had been shaping
up well, would be breached.
Rangers' captain Richard Gough lamented the fact that this was the
second time in two years he and his team-mates had been destroyed by a
stunning goal.
When Rangers were trying to qualify for the Champions' League two
years ago, they lost to Levski Sofia when Nicolae Todorov scored in the
final minute, and Gough added: ''Just before tonight's goal, Andy Goram
had made a fantastic save and none of us thought then that we would lose
a goal almost immediately.''
Steaua's goal came only six minutes from time after Alan McLaren and
Damian Militaru had both been sent off.
They were caught scuffling off the ball by a linesman who reported
their behaviour to referee Alain Sars, who showed both players the red
card.
Rangers manager Walter Smith, who will not have McLaren's services for
the match against German champions Borussia Dortmund at Ibrox in a
fortnight's time, said: ''I didn't see the McLaren incident, I don't
think anyone did. I was disappointed in terms of our possession of the
ball, but we had defended well enough.
''Steaua had a lot of pressure but were not creating a lot of
chances.''
While the Ibrox side may feel that the efforts of their central
defenders in particular deserved a share of the spoils, the Romanian
champions were worthy winners.
They had pushed forward from the beginning and at times their speed
was electrifying, but too often they lacked enough penetration around
their opponents' penalty box.
Dumitriu Dumitru, Steaua's coach, understandably was pleased with his
team's performance and pointed out that Rangers had defended too much.
''Although we made some mistakes defensively I think the result was
conclusive, and I am satisfied.
''I think that if Rangers had been more offensive, our task would have
been much more difficult.''
At the heart of Rangers defence, Gough and Gordan Petric had another
fine match, but unfortunately there were too many people around them who
were failing to contribute in the manner required at this level.
In particular, Paul Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup never managed to make
an impression, and without them at their best, Rangers will always be
unable to play with the creativity and flair that's needed, especially
at this level. Gascoigne can never be faulted for effort, but there is
something depressing about the sight of a #4.3m footballer charging
around a pitch in vain pursuit of possession.
As for Laudrup, he seemed to drift further into anonymity the longer
the game progressed, and although Rangers created one or two chances of
their own, they were under pressure for most of the match, mainly
because their midfield players could not match the speed and
determination of their counterparts.
Rangers' first match in this season's Champions' League was widely
regarded as the start of a hectic period of activity at the end of which
the exact strengths and weaknesses of Rangers' challenge would be
revealed. In midfield and up front, the verdict may be that Walter Smith
remains short.
The frustration, inevitably, became too much for Gascoigne who, after
having won a header in 24 minutes, chased the ball deep into Steaua's
territory on the left and foolishly lunged at Csik. The referee went for
his yellow card.
Rangers had a good opportunity towards the end of the first half when
Prodan fouled Miller on the edge of Steaua's box. Petric and Gascoigne
stood over the ball, but the Englishman's shot went straight to Stelea.
When Steaua resumed, it was without Bucur, whose place was taken by
Filipescu.
Rangers took Miller off in 71 minutes and sent on Durie, and five
minutes later McLaren and Militaru were red-carded.
Shortly afterwards Rangers made a second change, taking off Durrant
and sending on Murray, and his first duty was to become part of a
defensive wall after Steaua had been awarded a free kick 22 yards from
goal.
Galca curled the ball over the wall and Goram somehow turned the ball
away for a corner. Galca took the corner on Rangers' right and Prodan
struck a magnificent shot. The ball flew into the top right-hand corner
of Goram's net.
STEAUA BUCHAREST -- Stelea, Csik, Pirvu, Dobos, Galca, Prodan,
Raducan, Militaru, Vladoiu, A Ilie, Bucur. Substitutes -- Gherasim,
Nagy, Filipescu, Rosu, S Ilie.
RANGERS -- Goram, Wright, Gough, McLaren, Petric, Cleland, Miller,
Gascoigne, Durrant, McCoist, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Durie, Thomson,
Murray, Bollan, Reid.
Referee -- A Sars (France).

WHILE it has become traditional for English soccer fans to be herded
like beasts from trains and ferries to football grounds, there has been
no such curb on the loutish behaviour of English classical music fans.
Until now, yobs, albeit well-spoken yobs, have been encouraged to turn
up at the Promenade concerts in London's Royal Albert Hall dressed
ridiculously, armed with all manner of non-musical noise-making devices,
and committed to a programme of attention-seeking leaping around.
Happily there is no such exhibitionism at our own proms. The only
recorded incident in recent years at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall is of an
orchestrated protest against the then chief executive of the RSNO, Mr
Christopher Bishop, whose dismissal was called for silently with the
unfurling of a visually explicit, but beautifully designed, banner.
The London promenaders' behaviour traditionally reaches its apotheosis
with the Last Night of the Proms, an excuse for a jingoistic display of
pride in the Empire as distasteful as it is anachronistic. There is no
clear reason why the playing of Elgar's Land of Hope and Glory should be
greeted by a mob more suited to Spike Jones and his City Slickers than
the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Sir John Drummond is, therefore, to be
congratulated on his disapproval of the previous tolerance of the
promenaders' excesses. As he steps down as director of the Proms, he has
expressed the hope that he will be allowed to listen to the music on his
last night, has appealed for some decorum in dress, banned balloons,
popguns, and klaxons from the arena and -- the coup de grace --
commissioned a new work by Sir Harrison Birtwhistle to precede the
Elgar. One might fancy that Sir John, who was born in Perth, Western
Australia, was identifying with the republican tendency, but in fact the
inclusion of the Birtwhistle is only consistent with an adventurous Prom
programme that has included a concert by Steve Reich and jazz from the
Julian Joseph Big Band. Sir Harrison promises a 15-minute jazz piece
himself, featuring saxophone and a drum kit. It is entitled Panic, which
is what one must hope it stirs in the reactionary breasts of the
cloth-eared louts down front.

THEY are not the most fashionable team to have represented Scotland in
European competition, but Raith Rovers might prove capable of lasting a
bit longer in the UEFA Cup than some bigger and more experienced sides
have managed in recent times. The Fife club have played three matches in
the tournament so far and have not yet lost.
They won and drew in two preliminary round legs with Gotu
Itrottarfelag of The Faroes, even if their name is far more difficult to
tackle than their team, and came out with with a 3-1 win over Iceland's
Akranes in the opening leg of the first round on Tuesday, a result that
gives them a favourite's chance of reaching the next stage.
Now the wee team from Kirkcaldy have visions of attracting one of the
fancier names in the cup, and there are plenty of them, if they can
protect, or improve upon, that two-goal advantage.
The plan to make that possibility a reality has already begun in the
mind of manager Jimmy Nicholl, who was stripped for action on Tuesday
but, perhaps wisely, decided to stay on the bench.
''I reckoned Dave Kirkwood would have more to offer than me in that
position,'' was the honest summation of the player-manager, and Kirkwood
certainly did a fine job in the heart of midfield.
Nicholl intends to make full use of the 3-1 lead he takes to Iceland
and that will mean a sensible, disciplined approach to the second leg,
when the cavalier style that marked Rovers' attitude on Tuesday will not
be repeated.
The manager's logic insists that there is no point in using wingers
and a glut of forwards for a tie that demands a bit more caution and on
that basis his tactics will be based perhaps more on what the Icelanders
have to offer in that direction. They have plenty, to be fair.
The twin star turns, Arnar and Bjarki Gunnlaugsson, are players of
genuine quality who look as if they could cope well with higher level
demands, and their goalscorer, Olafur Thordason, is also a talented
individual.
''Those three are the players we would have to watch,'' said Nicholl,
''because they posed all the threat last night. The twins will be going
back to Feyenoord after their loan period and the Icelandic season is
over. Clearly, they are decent players, but it will be up to us to see
to it that they do not carry the same threat in the return.''
Rovers' manager was specially pleased for two-goal scorer Danny
Lennon, who had come through a lot of disappointment last season to
restate his claim to the spotlight. ''His attitude during his injury was
great,'' said Nicholl, ''and he did not let the disappointment of
missing the cup final keep him from fighting to get back his fitness,
and he got his reward last night.''
The consequences of a hard night's work at Stark's Park inevitably
included injuries and problems for Rovers' meeting with Kilmarnock at
home on Saturday. Captain Shaun Dennis will be absent as a result of
ankle ligament damage suffered in the game and two others with calf
injuries, Tony Rougier and Steven McAnespie, will need to be checked
out. Jim McInally, who missed the European tie because of a stomach
virus, may be able to play.
Barry Wilson, scorer of the crucial third goal, will be keen to keep
confirming his rehabilitation after an unhappy time at Southampton
where, as well as feeling homesick, he claims he felt virtually
ostracised.
''The senior players were OK, especially Tim Flowers, but I was left
out by the younger guys, and it was no home from home at the digs they
put me in. There were no other players in the digs and I had nowhere to
go at night.''
He interested Joe Jordan at Hearts, but says: ''He took so long to
make up his mind that I decided for him and said 'no thanks.' Joining
Raith has been brilliant -- this is a real family club.''
Maybe, in saying that, he has revealed the key to the Fife club's
remarkable resurgence. The fairy-tale may still have a few chapters to
go.

OUT-OF-TOWN RETAILING
By Martin Gudaitis, Colliers Erdman Lewis.
THE last quarter of last year and the first of this have shown a
decrease in investment activity in out-of-town retailing compared with
the previous two quarters. However, there is continuing high demand from
retailers for new opportunities.
This demand was largely driven by the emergence of new retailers in
the sector adopting new trading formats, and the genuine uncertainty
resulting from the Government's attitude to future out-of-town
developments. This uncertainty now appears justified, given the Scottish
Office's recent release of the Draft National Planning Policy Guideline
which strengthens policy in favour of town centre development and could
hinder the future development of large out-of-town centres.
Rentals of #9-#10 per sq ft have become the norm, and the Great
Western Retail Park in the West End of Glasgow is pre-let at rentals of
#10.50-#11.50 per sq ft. B &amp; Q has taken a unit of 100,000 sq ft from
the 180,000 sq ft scheme and other tenants include Allied Carpets,
Cantors, Harveys, World of Leather and Pet City.
In return for such high rentals, retailers often demand specifications
and premium payments to help with fitting-out costs. In many cases,
fitting-out can cost in excess of #250,000. The Great Western Retail
Park, a development by Ramjet Developments and Chartwell Land and due
for completion this month, is intended to be the first phase of an
overall #40m mixed use scheme.
Prime retail warehouse opportunities continue to attract interest from
institutions and yields still hover at around 6.5%. In October last
year, there were two significant transactions in this market. Westerwood
Limited, an associated company of The Walker Group, sold Stirling's
127,000 sq ft Springkerse Retail Park to CIN Properties. The fund
acquired the investment of #17.8m, and as CIN's first retail park in
Scotland, this represents an initial return of 6.25%.
In the same month, Scottish Amicable sold East Kilbride's 157,000 sq
ft Kingsgate Retail Park to General Accident for #27m, which reflects a
yield of 5.9% on an investment which Scottish Amicable had
forward-funded the previous year for #15.5m at a yield of around 9.5%.
Rentals are set at #9-#10 a sq ft.
The development market has continued to prove popular, with recent
tenders for sites in Livingston and Bathgate providing as many as 25
bidders. Profit margins, rental growth and yield improvements are still
anticipated. However, developers are becoming extremely frustrated at
the time, effort and money they are spending on what they regard as
aggressive submissions which are later revealed to be some way down the
pecking order of those received.
As the planning position becomes clearer over the next 12-18 months,
it is likely that the market will be established as two-tier.
The best out-of-town schemes, already being traded at keener yields,
will evolve into a half-way house between the high street and retail
warehousing. DIY and furniture retailers will be relieved to avoid these
higher rentals and remain in second-tier, bulky, good schemes where
rents will remain affordable.

EDINBURGH OFFICE MARKET
by Alan Robertson, Jones Lang Wooton.
THROUGHOUT this year a number of commentators on the Edinburgh office
market have predicted an imminent shortage of open-plan accommodation.
Although it is true to a certain extent that supply is limited,
unfortunately this has been accompanied by even more limited demand.
The first eight months of the year were -- even in comparison with the
previous recessionary years -- relatively quiet in terms of take-up of
larger office units, but there are now some signs that there could be a
flurry of lettings in the final quarter of the year. If this happens,
then a shortage of good quality open plan accommodation may well emerge
by next year.
Within the central area there is currently some 100,000 sq ft
available in high quality large units. This is in four buildings, the
largest of which is Clarendon House, George Street, at 34,000 sq ft.
Only two further schemes will reach completion this year: 7 Castle
Street, which will provide approximately 33,000 sq ft, and Conference
House, providing 31,000 sq ft. Market rumour suggests that two floors of
Conference House are already under offer at a rent in the region of #15
per sq ft.
Looking slightly further ahead, by far the most significant scheme
under construction in the central area is Exchange Plaza, which is a top
quality 100,000 sq ft development on the corner of Lothian Road and the
West Approach Road. Developers CALA-Morrison are scheduled to achieve
completion in early 1997. Significantly, there are no city centre
developments in excess of 10,000 sq ft which are scheduled to be
completed during next year. There is, therefore, a finite supply of good
quality new accommodation available up until early 1997.
Turning to de-centralised locations, no new buildings providing in
excess of 10,000 sq ft are currently available. The principal scheme
under development is Edinburgh Park, where the first phase of Lochside
Court will be finished next month and will provide self-contained units
of 12,000 sq ft and 18,000 sq ft respectively.
Elsewhere in the South Gyle area, the final phase of Pentland Gait
will also reach completion this autumn, providing units of 14,000 sq ft
and 11,000 sq ft. At Edinburgh Park, further speculative phases will be
brought onstream shortly, with the next completion being scheduled for
late summer/autumn 1996.
As in the city centre, the total supply of good quality accommodation
in the South Gyle area is fairly limited. This situation is unlikely to
change significantly unless work is commenced on speculative building on
Broadway Park and South Gyle Park within the next few months. Very
little activity is taking place in other decentralised locations, except
for Leith, where the Commercial Quay scheme can provide up to 50,000 sq
ft of offices finished to a shell specification.
Given the limited supply, one might expect landlords of existing
buildings to be confident about letting prospects, perhaps even to the
extent of reducing rent-free periods or concessionary packages. However,
due to the slow take-up of large units in the first eight months of this
year, this has not proved to be the case.
There have been only three long-term disposals to date this year,
totalling slightly more than 100,000 sq ft, but it should be borne in
mind that almost 70% of this was for one building -- Britannia Life's
sale of 113 Dundas Street to the Royal Bank of Scotland. Accordingly,
lack of competition has not yet led to a noticeable hardening of
attitudes among landlords.
In recent weeks, however, there has been a significant upturn in
demand. In particular, there are several requirements from organisations
such as the new East of Scotland Water Authority and the Scottish
Environmental Protection Agency, both of which have said they need to be
open for business in new buildings before April 1 next year.
In addition, a number of the medium-sized law firms are looking more
actively at the possibility of moving to modern offices, perhaps in
response to the outstanding success attributed to the earlier
re-locations of firms such as Shepherd &amp; Wedderburn, Dundas &amp; Wilson and
Alex Morison &amp; Co.
A further area of activity is in the computer software sector, with at
least four significant requirements now in the market. If even a portion
of this new demand is satisfied, it would quickly take up most of the
good quality buildings which are ready for immediate occupation.
The townhouse market continues to be fairly subdued in general, but
one sector which has been active this year is for small suites of up to
2000 sq ft. In certain instances this has allowed holders of long leases
to carry out a cost recovery programme by sub-letting their buildings on
a floor-by-floor basis. One very good example of this is at 14 Charlotte
Square where the head lease is held by Shepherd &amp; Wedderburn. Partly as
a result of a minor refurbishment programme, they successfully sub-let
three out of five floors prior to completion of the works.
The market for whole townhouses of 4000-5000 sq ft continues to be
sluggish, with many potential occupiers choosing to hold out for open
plan accommodation, even at this relatively small size.
Those organisations who are prepared to consider townhouses (and they
can operate efficiently as single units) are in the fortunate position
of being able to negotiate extremely attractive financial packages and
flexible lease terms.
With so little new space due for completion next year, there will
almost certainly be an upturn in activity in the development market.
However, prospective developers should remember that Edinburgh occupiers
have frequently shown that they will wait for the right product to come
along, rather than take defective buildings. Certain landlords are now
painfully aware of this fact.
In summary, the market for large modern buildings in central Edinburgh
looks set for an upturn, albeit due principally to lack of available
supply rather than booming demand. Landlords who have struggled to let
buildings through the recession are still prepared to be extremely
competitive in putting together attractive financial terms, but as the
already limited supply continues to be taken up, their attitudes will
certainly harden.
The message to organisations considering a relocation must be to ''buy
now while stocks last''.

COMMERCIAL RENTALS
By Ewan Easton, Maclay Murray and Spens.
THE courts in Scotland have been playing a major role in relation to
commercial property in the past few months. Another landmark case --
this time dealing with ''headline rents'' -- has just occurred.
A headline rent provision is one that seeks to ignore rent-free
periods and other first-time rent concessions in establishing the market
rent for a property at the first and subsequent rent reviews.
A rent at #20 per square foot with a first rent review after five
years looks rather different if the tenant also enjoys a full one year
rent-free at the start. In finding the ''true'' level of such a deal,
surveyors tend to spread the rent free over the first rent period. They
might say that the true rent therefore is #16 per square foot.
A landlord, on the other hand, may argue that the rent-free period
should be disregarded because the question of fitting out does not arise
at a rent review. He would say that #20 is the right figure for his
review purposes.
The biggest problems tend to occur when the rent-free period or other
concession is, in reality, an incentive to sign up rather than an
attempt by the landlord to help out with adaptation and relocation
costs. Faced with falling rents in some sectors, landlords have sought
to disguise their plight by keeping the ''headline rent'' constant but
offering ever longer rent-free periods or, in off-centre locations, cash
''bungs'' to secure the tenants' signature.
In some cases landlords have then sought to disguise what has occurred
by putting in a ''confidentiality'' provision which forbids anyone from
mentioning anything other than the headline rent.
The question for the courts may be the extent to which they are
prepared to enforce such artificial arrangements. Those questions still
lie ahead.
Fortunately the first case to come before the Scottish Courts
concerned a sensible institutional lease. The lease concerned a unit in
the St Enoch Centre, Glasgow -- a highly successful development
completed long before the recession threatened to cause chaos in the
once simple process of establishing ''the market rent'' at a review that
took place every five years or so.
In what is becoming a hallmark of these recent Scottish cases on
landlord and tenant issues, the Court of Session took a down-to-earth
view. The judgment reviews the history of rent review arrangements and
firmly reinforces the view that the issue for lawyers and surveyors
alike is to identify what the correct market rent is.
Only in the most exceptional circumstances will the courts enforce
something that imposes an artificial price on the tenant under a rent
review mechanism. Similarly, a tenant who is already trading will get
short shrift if he seeks to achieve another fitting out discount at rent
review.
The court may have taken a common sense approach but, with the
fiendishly complicated requirements of modern leases, it is not going to
be simple to sort the wheat from the chaff.
When a surveyor looks at rents newly achieved for comparable
properties when a rent review arises, how does he tell an incentive
arrangement -- which he should now seek to untangle and apply over the
whole first rent period -- from a bona fide fitting out allowance or
rent-free period designed to cover the one-off time at the start of the
lease when the tenant is adapting the premises to his particular
requirement? As if to illustrate the point that life is not going to be
simple, it seems that even this first case is likely to require at least
one more court hearing once more factual information is available to the
surveyor who has the thankless task of deciding between the landlord and
the tenant.
Sophisticated though the lease arrangement is, no-one could anticipate
the shenanigans that have gone on in some parts of the property market
over the past five years and so an arbiter is often still going to
require guidance in working out what to do with some of the more
Machiavellian provisions in leases put in place by desperate landlords
in much less successful developments than the St Enoch complex.
What then are the lessons for a hard-pressed finance director or
property manager? Inevitably, whether he is signing a lease for the
first time or approaching a rent review, he is going to need first rate
legal advice. The days of leaving the issue to a surveyor using a
''straw in the wind'' are sadly now over.
If his landlord is ''trying it on'' by referring only to headline
rents when trying to secure an increase at rent review, he might be well
advised to use the ''stated case'' procedure that has proved so
effective in this first case. Although it is not well known, it is
possible to get the court to give straightforward directions to an
arbiter right at the outset and, if a landlord is seeking to put one
over on the tenant, it seems that that is the time to act.
The really interesting question of confidentiality arrangements is
still to be tackled. It is very clear from the Lord President's decision
in the St Enoch case that the courts are going to be unsympathetic if
attempts are made to distort the open market idea and it is only a
matter of time before someone explodes a confidentiality provision.
This view may send shivers down the spine of quite a few landlords. It
is not only fringe developers who have tried to make use of these. Some
of the most prestigious office developments in Edinburgh and Glasgow --
Saltire Court for example -- are understood to use clauses of this sort
and their landlords may be reluctant to give them up without a fight.

OUT-OF-TOWN RETAILING
By Martin Gudaitis, Colliers Erdman Lewis.
THE last quarter of last year and the first of this have shown a
decrease in investment activity in out-of-town retailing compared with
the previous two quarters. However, there is continuing high demand from
retailers for new opportunities.
This demand was largely driven by the emergence of new retailers in
the sector adopting new trading formats, and the genuine uncertainty
resulting from the Government's attitude to future out-of-town
developments. This uncertainty now appears justified, given the Scottish
Office's recent release of the Draft National Planning Policy Guideline
which strengthens policy in favour of town centre development and could
hinder the future development of large out-of-town centres.
Rentals of #9-#10 per sq ft have become the norm, and the Great
Western Retail Park in the West End of Glasgow is pre-let at rentals of
#10.50-#11.50 per sq ft. B &amp; Q has taken a unit of 100,000 sq ft from
the 180,000 sq ft scheme and other tenants include Allied Carpets,
Cantors, Harveys, World of Leather and Pet City.
In return for such high rentals, retailers often demand specifications
and premium payments to help with fitting-out costs. In many cases,
fitting-out can cost in excess of #250,000. The Great Western Retail
Park, a development by Ramjet Developments and Chartwell Land and due
for completion this month, is intended to be the first phase of an
overall #40m mixed use scheme.
Prime retail warehouse opportunities continue to attract interest from
institutions and yields still hover at around 6.5%. In October last
year, there were two significant transactions in this market. Westerwood
Limited, an associated company of The Walker Group, sold Stirling's
127,000 sq ft Springkerse Retail Park to CIN Properties. The fund
acquired the investment of #17.8m, and as CIN's first retail park in
Scotland, this represents an initial return of 6.25%.
In the same month, Scottish Amicable sold East Kilbride's 157,000 sq
ft Kingsgate Retail Park to General Accident for #27m, which reflects a
yield of 5.9% on an investment which Scottish Amicable had
forward-funded the previous year for #15.5m at a yield of around 9.5%.
Rentals are set at #9-#10 a sq ft.
The development market has continued to prove popular, with recent
tenders for sites in Livingston and Bathgate providing as many as 25
bidders. Profit margins, rental growth and yield improvements are still
anticipated. However, developers are becoming extremely frustrated at
the time, effort and money they are spending on what they regard as
aggressive submissions which are later revealed to be some way down the
pecking order of those received.
As the planning position becomes clearer over the next 12-18 months,
it is likely that the market will be established as two-tier.
The best out-of-town schemes, already being traded at keener yields,
will evolve into a half-way house between the high street and retail
warehousing. DIY and furniture retailers will be relieved to avoid these
higher rentals and remain in second-tier, bulky, good schemes where
rents will remain affordable.

THERE was an air of confidence about Celtic as they flew into Georgia
yesterday, almost aggression, as they prepared for their European
Cup-winners' Cup first-round game.
There is no doubt the Parkhead men recognise that Dinamo Batumi are a
quality team. Their preliminary round game against Obilic from Belgrade,
when they won, proved that beyond doubt. Yet, there is a sense about
Celtic which says that they have come to this furthest outpost of
European soccer looking for a victory.
From Tommy Burns, who is making his debut in Europe as a team manager,
down to young Simon Donnelly, the feeling grows that Celtic are looking
for a result which could catapult them into the next round.
Donnelly said: ''I honestly believe that we can win, but if we don't,
then we will score an away goal. That is very important.
''I think we are the kind of team who can do this. We want to attack
all the time. Look back to the game at Aberdeen, where we were two goals
down and yet win 3-2. That tells everything about our attitude.''
Donnelly, of course, has known little of Celtic's European exploits,
but he does remember a victory over Cologne after Celtic had lost two
goals away from home in Germany.
At that time he had just signed for the club, and he recalled: ''It
was a wonderful atmosphere. I just want that to happen again.''
Donnelly will play, of course, and he may be still in the wide right
position where Burns has used him this season. There may be those who
think he would be better employed further infield, as a second striker,
but at Aberdeen he showed a skill and talent which suggested that Burns
may have found the 20-year-old's best role.
The young man in question said: ''I don't care where I play. There are
times when you just want to be in the team. That is how I am now. If the
boss wants me to play anywhere, and it means I am in the side, then I'll
go for it.
''I have enjoyed the role that he has given me. After all, I was out
of the team because of injury last season and now I am back in and I
want to stay there. I really believe that I can contribute wherever I
play.
''We have not been told a lot about Batumi, but they will have to be
very good to defeat us the way we feel right now.''
While Celtic have this belief in themselves, the Georgians worry over
the match. They have offered their players a $5000 bonus -- 10 times
their normal monthly wage -- but even that does not seem likely to lift
the men who go in against Celtic.
The Georgians believe they will probably go out at this level of the
competition. However, Celtic must beware of the way that Dinamo perform
in front of their own supporters. They can do so much better in their
Black Sea home.
Celtic, however, do not look on them lightly. Burns said: ''We may not
have seen them live, but we know how they play. Our team will go out
knowing about the opposition.
''The important thing is that we play the game the way we want to play
it. We know what we want to achieve and I believe that the players are
capable of giving us a result which we can bring back to Glasgow and be
happy with.''
Somehow, the Georgians have a sense of doom. They remember the Celtic
of yesteryear, the Celtic who won the European Cup, the Celtic who
conquered so many sides across the Continent, even here in Georgia.
That reputation may help Burns and his fledglings when they step into
the 25,000-capacity stadium today.
It is something which, along with last weekend's result in Aberdeen
when John Collins played so well, can lift the Celtic team, and perhaps
inspire them to a victory reminiscent of the teams who have gone before
them.
* TEN years after lifting the Cup-winners' Cup -- their first European
triumph -- Everton launch a new campaign today, confident they can
underline England's fresh ambitions in Europe.
Everton beat Rapid Vienna 3-1 in the 1985 final, but were unable to
defend the trophy in the wake of the Heysel Stadium riot between
Liverpool and Juventus fans two weeks later. The tragedy led to English
clubs being banned from Europe for five years.
Now managed by Joe Royle, who was in the club's 1969-70
championship-winning team, Everton go to Iceland for their first-round,
first-leg match against Reykjavik.
Despite being arguably the weakest of the three European competitions,
the Cup-winners' Cup still features several strong contenders, such as
Italy's Parma and Paris St Germain.
Parma won the UEFA Cup last season but opted for the Cup-winners'
after being beaten in the Italian Cup final last June by Juventus, who
are in the Champions' League.
The Italians, who travel to Albania to meet Teuta Durres, will have
Gianfranco Zola alongside Bulgarian Hristo Stoichkov in attack.
Paris St Germain, who reached the semi-finals of each of the three
European competitions in the last three seasons, hope to go one step
further and are confident of their prospects against Norway's Molde FK.

SCOTLAND'S biggest and most important event of the Flat season, the
three-day Western Meeting at Ayr, gets off to a flying start today with
a highly competitive card which has attracted 122 runners.
Mick Kinane, the Irish Champion, Pat Eddery, and Jason Weaver,
currently second in the championship with 131 winners, are among the top
jockeys in action today.
John Gosden, Michael Stoute, Peter Chapple-Hyam, and Barry Hills from
the big yards in the south, are all represented, but the man holding
most cards is likely to be Mark Johnston.
The 35-year-old Scot, on 96 winners, has five runners, and could reach
his century before Saturday when he hopes to cap a great year by winning
the Ladbroke Ayr Gold Cup with his six-year-old mare, Branston Abby.
The opening race is a charity event to celebrate the 125th anniversary
of the British Red Cross. The 15 amateur riders who are taking part at
the invitation of Ayr racecourse, include Hazel Dudgeon, chief executive
of Hamilton Park, Jim Delahunt, Scottish Television sports presenter,
and Mr Sandy Love, one of Scotland's top amateur jockeys.
They have raised money for the Red Cross through sponsorship, and Miss
Rowena Ramsey, who partners All One has collected #6000.
Contrafire, from Bill Jarvis's Newmarket stable, who won over this
distance at Lingfield recently, and Mrs Mary Reveley's Keep Your
Distance, successful on its last two outings, would appear to have the
race between them, but in a charity event of this kind, anything could
happen.
The #8000 Ladbrokes Sprint Handicap has attracted the maximum field of
29. Pat Eddery rides top weight Lepine, beaten favourite when third to
Coffee n' Cream at Ascot. The Bill Watts four-year-old has most to fear
from Portelet, an easy winner of a five-furlong sprint at Thirsk earlier
this month.
The feature race, the 15,000 Timeform Lord Rosebery Trophy, has
attracted a top class field of two-year-olds. Eastern Prophets, beaten a
short head by Rambling Bear in a 10,000 event at Kempton Park, is almost
certain to be favourite.
There are several others in with a chance, including Soviet Style,
Tarf, Hear The Music, Whicksey Perry, and Westcourt Magic.

* BREAST cancer is in the news again and many women will be wondering
whether to cancel their mammogram appointment. But the real question is
not over the effectiveness of mammography but one of health economics.
The argument goes: Is it cost effective to spend #30m a year screening
women in the 50-65 age group in order to save a few thousand lives while
the current spending on research is #1m? Would it not be better to spend
the money on research instead? Meanwhile it's left to local fund-raisers
to generate income. One of Scotland's newest charities, the Scottish
Breast Cancer Appeal will benefit from a wedding fashion show to be held
on Sunday, tickets #5. There will be two shows, at 2pm and 4pm in the
Royal Scottish Automobile Club, 11 Blythswood Square, Glasgow G2 4AG.

* DRUGS, we all know, carry side-effects. Nevertheless one surprising
side-effect from the antidepressant clomipramine has startled everybody.
Some people appear to get spontaneous orgasms after taking the drug.
Four patients reported in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry said they
got spontaneous orgasms every time they yawned.
This has all come to light on the Internet where people are busy
comparing symptoms and it's reported in New Scientist. One man, cured of
his depression, asked if he could continue taking the drug because he
enjoyed the side-effects so much. He had solved any awkward and
embarrassing moments with the drug by wearing a condom all day.
Correspondence on the Net confirms the Canadian findings. It's
believed that about 5% of people who use clomipramine, brand name
Anatranil, experience this side effect.
* THE Defeat Depression Campaign has fizzled out. Launched in 1992 by
doctors and psychiatrists to promote a better understanding of
depression, it has failed to make an impact. Only 5% of people had ever
heard of it.
* ANYONE considering residential or nursing care for an elderly
relative should take a look at the latest edition of the Scottish
Residential and Nursing Home Directory. This is the seventh edition and
it offers a list of more than 1000 homes listed region by region. Copies
are distributed free to libraries, dentists, hospitals, GPs and
Citizens' Advice Bureaux, or you can buy it for #5 from Care Home
Publications, 6 Rutland Court Lane, Edinburgh, EH3 8EF. 0131-221 9960.
* TRAVEL companies are failing to warn people of the health hazards in
some countries with the result that many people are returning home ill.
A new government book, Health Information for Overseas Travel, aims to
counteract this. They say that many people fail to consult their GPs
before going abroad because of misleading information from their travel
agents regarding immunisations.
Because no certificates are required does not mean that immunisation
is not advisable to protect personal health. A copy of the book is being
sent to all GPs.
* ELDERLY people and those at high risk who have regular flu vaccines
are 75% less likely to die than those who have never been immunised,
says a report in The Lancet. A study of 1000 people carried out at the
universities of Nottingham and Leicester over two years found that
regular flu vaccinations were necessary to reduce the risk of dying.
Those who had received only the current one vaccination had a 9% reduced
risk of death.

ANN SHAW highlights
a unique service for
blind people
FLORENCE lives alone. The 81-year-old's sight is poor and she can no
longer read, but she manages to look after herself with some basic
community care and a regular home-help. The highlight of her week though
is the arrival of her ''talking'' newspaper. She pops it into her
cassette and within minutes she is up to date with all the local news.
Afterwards she may leave it aside for a few days then play it again
before posting it back. This is made easy. She doesn't have to worry
about envelopes or stamps. The tape arrives in a re-usable wallet
already stamped first class and free, a service provided by the Post
Office.
What makes all this possible for Florence and thousands like her, is
that hundreds of volunteers throughout Britain give up their time to
record their local paper. They do so under the umbrella organisation,
National Talking Newspapers, which has more than 500 independent local
groups.
Yet many are unaware of their existence. While it's estimated that
there are more than 1.7 million people who suffer some form of visual
impairment, only about a third take advantage of the services provided
by this charity.
Hopefully all this will change. National Talking Newspaper Week starts
next Monday with the aim of raising the profile of the service.
Scotland's largest recording service for the blind is Playback, based
in Glasgow. They produce their own monthly magazine full of information,
news and interviews as well as The Scots Magazine and tapes of
Scottish-based television programmes.
''We hope that National Talking Newspaper Week will make more people
aware of this unique service,'' says Brian West, secretary of the
Scottish Talking Newspaper Group.
The service operates on two levels: the national organisation produces
180 newspapers and magazines, including The Herald, for which people pay
an annual subscription of #15. They are entitled to as many papers and
magazines as they wish.
Then there is the flourishing free local tier: over 60 groups in
Scotland (500 nationwide) tape their local paper for the blind in the
community. Some are put together by a small band of only three or four
volunteers.
Finding helpers is rarely a problem: ''If a group finds itself
under-staffed all it has to do is put a notice in the local paper or
library,'' says West. ''No, our problem is publicising the service. We
feel many more could benefit from it if only they knew about our
existence.''

BRIAN Denoon's response to my letter raises an important issue
(September 11). He pits the supposedly unchanging ''instincts of
humanity'' against ''the logic of theology''. But are not the
''instincts of humanity'' relative to their environment?
Society's acceptance of divorce, abortion, and more recently
euthanasia underlines the changing face of what is humanly tolerated.
Individuals can also display a range of instinctive behaviour, and who
decides which is inhuman?
As the tragedy of the holocaust displays what normal ''humanity'' is
capable of, it is clear that our instincts are not to be depended upon.
I for one would not like to be reliant upon the whims of instinctive
humanity.
The Bible provides an unchanging guide to what is morally acceptable
behaviour between individuals, although sadly, as Mr Denoon is at pains
to emphasise, those who commit terrible atrocities occasionally claim
divine countenance for their actions.
While much ''inhumanity'' has been committed in the name of
Christianity, I would assert that this is due to a failure by the church
in the control of instinctive humanity rather than a by-product of
following Jesus.
''The way'' that Jesus describes is at times antagonistic to the
instincts of humanity but not in the justification of brutality but in
restraining us from such.
Christianity provides the framework with which to develop and provide
necessary correction to our natural instincts. Those who believe that
they do not require this control should examine their own ''instincts of
humanity'' carefully and honestly.

JACK McLean suggests that women have no taste in alcohol (September
8).
Mr Francis Showering researched, produced, marketed and sold Babycham
(sweet and dry) with great success. In so doing he gave honest
employment to hundreds of people over a number of years, providing many
benefits in addition to salaries and wages.
He was also generous in providing facilities for the townspeople of
Shepton Mallet, his home town.
The House of Showering was held in high regard by the Licensed
Victuallers' Association and many Scots are enjoying pensions in
retirement which started through the Showerings pension scheme.
Jack McLean's rather derisory remarks following closely upon Mr
Showering's death are in my opinion distasteful to say the very least.

SOME may wonder how Railtrack, the public body responsible for the
rail infrastructure in the UK, achieved such a large profit in its first
financial year.
I will tell you. Sir Robert Horton, chairman of Railtrack, and the
rest of his executive raised track-access charges for train-operating
companies ranging from increases of 20% to as much as 90%. This was a
deliberate attempt to ensure that Railtrack is a profitable asset for
the Government to sell off to finance tax cuts leading up to the next
General Election.

MIGHT I reply to James Mulholland who writes about my grasp of reality
(September 11)? Having spent 40 years working as a truck driver, sewer
cleaner, engine-room scaffie, building-site worker, and so on, I think I
have a good grasp on reality. Indeed at one point I worked for #1.50 a
week less than I would have received from Social Security.
I too have been a university student living on a grant with a wife and
two schoolchildren. I stick to my guns. Life is what you make it, you
are not forced to work in a job that you detest, or is stressful, or
that you just plain hate. You can walk out the door at any time.
On one occasion I left a fully-laden truck standing at the kerb,
handed the keys to the manager and said goodbye. He didn't have a truck
driver's licence but it then became his problem, not mine.
One way round the problem for James Mulholland is not to run up bills,
and what is so wonderful about ''having a couple of bob in one's
pocket''? The libraries and museums are free and your legs can carry you
along the banks of the Clyde gazing at the scenery.

But, more important than that, it must take advantage of informed

MURRAY Ritchie's identification of tourism as Scotland's largest
industry and his comments on Scotland's attractions are accurate but his
concerns about ''creeping elitism'' in Scottish golf are not totally
justified (September 12).
While a few courses have introduced restrictions on visitor access, we
still possess an outstanding asset in the range and quality of Scottish
golf courses.
Moreover, access to the vast majority of Scottish golf courses for
visitors is still relatively easy by comparison with the congestion they
may experience in the South-east of England and elsewhere.
None the less, as Murray Ritchie suggests, we need to be vigilant
about protecting our asset and at the same time ensure that it remains
as accessible as possible to visitors and residents alike.
This is not always an easy equation to balance as recent events at the
St Andrews Links would indicate. However, the Scottish Tourist Board and
many of the organisations and agencies involved are working together to
introduce new marketing and promotional plans for the game that will
stimulate tourism at the local level and introduce welcome revenue to
golf clubs.
After all, Scotland bequeathed the game to the world and no other
country can mimic that achievement. Scotland needs to respond to the
challenge posed by the introduction of new facilities and packages in
countries like Ireland and that will require everyone involved in the
game and in the tourist industry to adopt a new approach to the phrase
''visitors welcome''.

THERE must be an error in your reporting of the St Mary's Episcopal
Primary School opt-out (September 12). Graeme Young, acting Director of
Education, is reported as questioning the viability of such a small
school and the running costs of such an operation.
Can this be the same Graeme Young who personally proposed to parents
the refurbishment of St Mary's at a cost of #375,000 for a reduced roll
of 36 pupils causing the opt-out vote in the first place? Does this mean
the death-knell for the small primary schools in Central region?
Progress towards a new primary school in Dunblane has taken 20 years.
It would not have translated even to the earthworks it is now without St
Mary's opt-out.
These statements by Central region are merely an attempt at
disinformation to protect the educational establishment's right to run
our schools.  St Mary's will be successful because it offers excellent
educational standards and will shortly be freed from the bureaucratic
ineptitude.

YOU carried a photograph of the pilot wave-power plant under
construction near Portnahaven on Islay. It is wonderful to stand there
now and watch the power of the waves being turned into electricity
through air driving a turbine as the plant chamber fills and empties of
water. How sad then to watch the Osprey sink.
Sadder still to learn that the Portnahaven unit will be gone in 1997.
The precondition of its construction was I understand that funds be
guaranteed for its removal in 1997 -- total removal required by Scottish
Natural Heritage.
How does the Energy Minister, Tim Eggar, square this treatment with
the approach to nuclear energy and its destiny once the plants expire?
He has withdrawn all funding from wave energy development on the
strength of forecast costs of energy generation.
If ever we needed signs of entrepreneurship, we need it in Government.

I HAVE yet to see Braveheart but when I do I will know that it is a
film based loosely on the life and times of William Wallace, Scottish
patriot and freedom fighter; it stars Mel Gibson in the role of Wallace;
and it will probably have as much historical accuracy as Charlton
Heston's Moses, Marlon Brando's Zapata, or even the stories from
Scottish history that were fed to my generation in primary school.
If it provokes Scots to find out about our Scottish heroes or to
consider whey there is a monument to Wallace in Stirling then all to the
good.
When I do go to see the film -- as entertainment -- I will clear my
mind, open my eyes, sit back, think of England and enjoy.

IT is most unfortunate from the Conservative point of view that the
Prime Minister, like his predecessor, succeeds in antagonising a large
proportion of us when he comes to Scotland. Even many of the business
community feel this way, as do a substantial number of members of his
own party.
If only he had the sense to refrain from making ''loopy'' statements
about devolution. One can understand his opposition to a Scottish
parliament as proposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but he fails
to give one inch towards the Scots having any say on how they are
governed.
Whether by intention or stubbornness he has written off Scotland as
far as Conservatism is concerned. I am sure if he was to make a
conscious effort to understand that Scotland is a nation and not just an
appendage of England the morale of his Conservative membership would
improve tremendously.
As it is a great many Tories have lost faith in their Government and
keep their Tory ideology to themselves. Like Mrs Thatcher he comes north
and insults our intelligence.

I was delighted to read Finlay MacLeod's assessment of Calvinist
fundamentalism and its exponents (September 6).
It should come as no surprise that grown men who believe in talking
bushes and women turned into pillars of salt should hold many other
infantile views.
I myself would be delighted by the absurdity of their stance were it
not for the fact that these same grown men are appealing to the basest
levels of fear and ignorance in our society in order to fuel the fires
of hatred and intolerance (as witnessed in John Macleod's homophobic
diatribe of August 29).
As to Professor Donald Macleod's comparison of his son John to Salman
Rushdie (September 7), let us not forget that it was a fundamentalist
religious leader who caused Mr Rushdie's problems in the first instance
and, lest we get too carried away with the comparison, the threat which
now hangs over Mr Rushdie's head is one of death not criticism.
I suggest we try to avoid the extremism which gives rise to such
threats in the first place and let homosexuals, heterosexuals, and
undecided sexual abstainers go in peace.

WITH the current furore going on about Catholic priests and celibacy I
find it difficult to have any sympathy for priests who wish to have
sexual relationships.
Father Gilhooley says he wants to have sex and I assume he wishes to
serve God, the two are not incompatible. However, being a priest is a
job and part of the job description is celibacy.
Priests know before training for priesthood begins that it involves
celibacy. If they do not wish to be celibate then why do they wish to
become priests? Is it a case of having your cake and eat it?

WE need more democracy in this country, not less. Democratic
institutions need to be expanded not contracted because the ambitions of
powerful individuals and groups need to be controlled in the interests
of the people.
It is the lack of strong democratic institutions that leads to the
emergence of Mussolinis, Hitlers, Stalins, Maos, Karadjics, and Pol
Pots.
The emergence of media moguls as moulders of public opinion should
also be prevented by democratic laws to prevent media concentrations of
capital.
Now that the Labour and Liberal Democratic parties have published
their joint declaration on devolution for Scotland they and the Scottish
National Party should declare the above aims as their main purpose in
obtaining independence from Westminster and tell us how each of them
propose to achieve them.
The true democrats among the Scots eagerly await this so that we can
judge which of the parties has the most practical policy for real
freedom for the Scots.

By Bill Binnie, partner, Grimley.
THE property investment market has been extremely sluggish over the
past 12 months following the hiatus of late 1993/1994. The first six
months of 1994 saw a strong surge in investment demand as property
returns looked extremely attractive against the investment alternatives
such as equities and long-dated gilts.
However, the stushie was short lived. With a sharp upward movement in
long-dated gilts in early 1994, brought about by the continued rise in
interest rates, the overheated property market no longer looked such an
attractive alternative unless investors could be assured of rental
growth to boost returns. In addition, the perennial problem of property
liquidity resulted in the majority of funds withdrawing from the market
after the summer recess of 1994. This resulted in a subdued investment
market over the past year, with only a limited number of significant
office transactions taking place in the city.
Ranx Xerox Limited acquired Gatehouse at 201/203 West George Street
late in 1994 for #2.8m which reflected a net initial yield of 6.64%. The
property is let to four good tenants with the leases expiring in 2009.
In January 1995 the Rover Pension Fund paid #4.205m for Berkeley House
at 285 Bath Street. The property was well let with an excess of 15 years
left to run on the occupational leases. The initial yield of 7.86%
reflected its fringe location.
Six months later, Sun Life Properties paid #4.6m for Douglas House, a
30,500 sq ft (2,833m[2]) office block in Waterloo Street. This sale
revives memories of Tanap, one of the city's most flamboyant developers
of the 1990s, whose major claim to fame was the development of Tay
House, which still remains partially unlet five years after practical
completion.
Douglas was a comprehensive refurbishment of a late 1960s development
and the acquisition yield (7.2%) reflects the property's fringe
location. Most recently, Standard Life acquired Pacific House at 70
Wellington Street for #9m reflecting a net initial return of 7.2%. While
this property has generally aged better than most mid-80 developments,
it is now more than 10 years old, and the specification does not reflect
the current requirements of discerning occupational tenants.
Of this list of investment transactions carried out over the course of
the past 12 months, none can be regarded as prime, either from the point
of view of location or quality of accommodation. It would seem that the
owners of prime office holdings within the central core remain confident
at the potential for short-term rental growth due to the current
shortage of modern open-plan office accommodation within the central
core.
At present, Glasgow cannot provide a single new office development
within the recognised central core in excess of 40,000 sq ft (3716m[2])
and only 227 West George Street can provide a self-contained property of
more than 30,000 sq ft (2787m[2]) within a prime location. This acute
shortage of modern open-plan accommodation was also reflected in the
occupation of the Grosvenor Building by Scottish Amicable investment
managers in the spring of this year, where the only alternative was Tay
House in Charing Cross.
This severe restriction in choice was uppermost in David Hunter's mind
when acquiring Ashley House at 181 West George Street for redevelopment.
Here Scottish Amicable are confident of strong tenant demand which will
set new rental levels within the city for a building which will meet the
requirements of modern occupational tenants within a prime location.
Pillar and Friends Provident also perceive a serious shortage of
quality accommodation within the city, and have commenced the
construction of building 4 Broomilaw (133,000 sq ft) (12,356m[2]) and
the redevelopment of Alhambra House (100,000 sq ft) (9290m[2]). While
these three developments will provide an additional 350,000 sq ft
(32,500m[2]), completion will not be until 1997, leaving the city with
an acute shortfall in supply in the interim of international quality
office accommodation to attract inward investors.
It is therefore envisaged that this shortage, coupled with a rising
demand from occupational tenants as we continue to emerge from the
recession, will result in strong short-term rental growth within the
city. It is therefore paradoxical that the general perception for prime
office yield within the city is that it has eased over the past six
months from 6% to 6.5%, at a time when future performance will be
bolstered by strong rental growth.
The occupational tenant is, however, becoming more discerning, a fact
that landlords/developers seem relucant to acknowledge. While the city
has seen a significant reduction in the availability of quality
new/refurbished accommodation within the central core, the total
available space within the city centre has remained static at
approximately 1.7m sq ft. This is due to an ever-increasing supply of
older accommodation coming back onto the market which offsets the
take-up at the quality end. We remain convinced that the vast majority
of the secondary/refurbished accommodation will remain unlet, thereby
giving an inaccurate picture of the city's supply and demand ratio.
In addition, we foresee secondary rents stagnating due to the acute
and continued problems over supply where tenants can dictate letting
terms to landlords becoming increasingly desperate to pass on the rising
repairing liabilities to the occupational tenant.
In the future, we see an increased yield gap between prime and
secondary office investment as funds reflect tenant obsolescence within
secondary/fringe buildings and its obvious impact on future growth.
Conversely, funds will be willing to pay keener investment yields for
properties which truly reflect the performance potential within the city
from modern open-plan and well-located office accommodation.
We eagerly await the first investment disposal of such a prime
commodity as we sincerely believe that the resultant purchase price will
reflect the strong growth potential there is currently within the
Glasgow office sector.

SO, Glasgow is to host the City of Architecture and Design in 1999,
having beaten Liverpool and Edinburgh for the prize. So what?
Is this success part of a grand master plan by the city fathers to
take us into the new millennium? Part of a regeneration strategy which
has been carefully worked through and is now reaching the implementation
phase? If so, I wonder how the massive shopping centre development
attached to the concert hall, the business park at Pacific Quay, and the
''restructuring'' of the city's architectural department into the
''Estates Department'', with the subsequent loss of the City Architect,
fit into this plan?
What, then, differentiated the Glasgow bid from those of its rivals?
It is unlikely to have been the quality of its existing environment or
its wealth of modern architecture. The city has few new buildings of
national significance and no modern building of international standing.
Surely, what must have impressed is the undoubted warmth and enthusiasm
of its inhabitants, coupled with the earnest collective hunger after
improvement.
Sadly, neither of these admirable qualities will be sufficient to
enable us to make the most of the opportunity and to establish a
threshold for the future built environment.
I ask you to consider many of the recent building proposals within the
city and for other important sites, such as the National Gallery of
Scottish Art in George Square, the millennium tower at St Enoch Square,
and in particular the piecemeal activity around the Clyde and suggest
that development in Glasgow follows no structured strategy or
regeneration plan.
If the city fathers do have a vision they are surely keeping it to
themselves or are collectively myopic. Development occurs in what
appears to be a haphazard and uncoordinated manner and is, on the whole,
a response to short-term business needs and not long-term civic
interest. However, as the recent Bilbao 2000 exhibition at Princess
Square testified, there is an alternative which can bring together both
private funding and public interests to produce buildings of quality.
What is needed is vision, a will, and above all a plan.
Can Glasgow rise to the challenge? The city certainly has
architectural talent to rival any international city, although few
practices are working to their full capacity, with two highly rated
schools of architecture producing a stream of potential. Indeed, to have
studied at the ''Mackintosh'' school especially, brings with it a kudos
that experience at few other schools can provide.
Both schools excel in areas of urban development, yet for most
graduates the easiest career opportunities mean a move to London, Paris
or Berlin. These other cities then benefit from the training and
enthusiasm which is lost to Glasgow. Those architects who remain or who
choose to return do so because they have a genuine affection for the
city and an interest, some might say misplaced, in improving the
situation.
What then can be done? Working to the age-old adage ''If you want a
thing done, best do it yourself'' the Glasgow Institute of Architects
has initiated a programme of activity which seeks generally to raise
awareness of the year of architecture and design in the community. To do
this, a steering group has been formed to gather information on what has
been achieved elsewhere, to promote the fundamental role which
architects could and should play, and to put forward proposals for
quality design.
Supporting these overarching aims and working with the community
association objectives proposed in the original bid, we are planning a
programme of seminars and workshops, aimed initially at secondary
schools but which can be used as a catalyst for debate in the wider
community.
It is our belief that Glasgow and the people of Glasgow deserve better
and we have already started on a programme of regeneration to focus
attention on the river as an artery for positive change and improvement.
Many of you will be aware that there are a multitude of other areas of
the city which warrant attention and the GIA welcomes individual or
group views. However, at this point the Clyde and its environs offer the
greatest potential for improvement and are in most immediate danger of
being abused through the adoption of inappropriate ''design and build''
solutions and other short-term commercial fixes.
Both schools of architecture will be included in an extensive study to
conclude with a design workshop to bring together architects,
developers, and the public and to which we hope to invite
internationally respected figures with successful track records in urban
regeneration. From this and other initiatives we will garner sufficient
support and understanding to enable us to put forward our own viable
regeneration plan.
Some may feel that we are throwing down the gauntlet, but I suggest
that a more positive attitude might be to see our activity as a clarion
call to those interested individuals and groups who genuinely seek to
make Glasgow a great city not just for 1999, but for generations to
come.

THE nuclear industry in Britain does not like to be criticised. Even
less does it like to be hauled before the courts for safety lapses or to
be told by local planners that its procedures are wrong. In all cases
the remedy is in its own hands. Run the industry properly, be open,
honest, and willing to admit that nuclear power and those involved in it
are not necessarily God's gift to the world and matters will improve
considerably. It is difficult to say whether the managers of the
Dounreay nuclear complex in Caithness have understood these basic
lessons. Their plans for a facility to hold radioactive waste at
Dounreay were passed by Highland region councillors yesterday after more
than two years of arguing over the design. It is not disputed that the
new plans are a vast improvement on the old ones which were rejected by
Highland region in 1993. What should not be forgotten is that the plans
submitted in 1993 were hopelessly inadequate and were rejected by
councillors after a tour of the Dounreay site in which they came across
rusting, and in some cases open, drums of low-level radioactive waste
lying around in a shallow pit.
The Dounreay management did not like to be told that this was
unacceptable or that their plans were simply not good enough, but then
they have never been graceful recipients of criticism. What was
surprising was the way in which the Atomic Energy Authority bridled at
the rejection of its plans for a storage facility and lodged an appeal
to the Secretary of State. If the new plans are acceptable it is thanks
to the common sense of Highland region and not to the AEA or to
management at Dounreay. Nor should the nuclear industry imagine that
acceptance of the new plans necessarily implies widespead acceptance of
its hopes for large-scale nuclear reprocessing at Dounreay.
The future of the nuclear industry has been likewise thrown into sharp
focus by the worrying events at the Wylfa nuclear power station at
Anglesey where staff hesitated for nine hours before shutting down a
reactor which was damaged. Their reasons were worry over suffering
financial penalties from the National Grid. This is a clear indication
of money being put before safety and a warning of the attitudes which
may prevail in a privatised nuclear industry. Labour promises to impose
a rigorous safety regime, but the present regime is rigorous in theory.
The struggle to make it rigorous in fact, especially under commercial
pressure, has yet to be won.

IT IS nice to see an old, decayed, but worthy part of Edinburgh being
refurbished, and even more so when the proposals include the eminently
sensible idea of bringing cruise liners, and their accompanying foreign
tourists, into the capital. These ships have been calling at Leith in
increasing numbers, as they have at other Scottish ports including ones
as far-flung as Kirkwall and Lerwick. They bring visitors and revenue to
local shops and businesses, but it has been clear for some time that
facilities at Leith were woefully inadequate. Foreign tourists do not
like to be landed at a wasteland or to be faced with alarming journeys
before they can get to their destination. Earlier this summer the
passengers on one large cruise liner had to be disembarked at Rosyth and
bused into Edinburgh in what can hardly have been an ideal introduction
to the delights of the area.
Forth Ports, which is the driving force behind the new proposals, is
surely right to argue for the benefits of expanding traditional ship and
port businesses. If it succeeds in taking over the Tilbury docks in
London it will have engineered an excellent opportunity to encourage
cruise liners calling at London to add Leith to their itinerary. All of
this will blend in nicely with what is already being seen as the
renaissance of Leith. The Scottish Office has moved there and there is
already an eruption of good restaurants, wine bars, and other
manifestations of investment and opportunity. There is, however, another
side to Leith which is less pleasant and which cannot be ignored.
Although it is close to Edinburgh city centre it has failed to shed the
image of decay and of criminality, especially in relation to drugs and
prostitution. Imaginative Scottish enterprises like this have often been
ruined by a failure to take a co-ordinated approach to an entire area.
Leith deserves better.

By Jon Robertson, partner, Dundas &amp; Wilson.
The new Act is a godsend for lawyers trying to ascertain exactly what
legal form a particular arrangement has to be in or how it requires to
be signed.
FOR hundreds of years Scottish lawyers have baffled their clients with
obscure phrases such as ''adopted as holograph'', ''probative writ'' and
''obligationes literis'' whenever discussing the topic of formal legal
documents. Truth be told, the bafflement has not always been one-sided,
for lawyers themselves have often been left scratching their heads when
attempting to work out exactly what some of the more obtuse legal
requirements for the signing of deeds are.
On August 1, however, the requirements changed. The old Scots law on
the signing of deeds, built up over hundreds of years and contained in
various Acts of Parliament (some dating back to well before the Act of
Union) and numerous cases, has now been consigned to the dusty shelves
of law libraries. The old law is now replaced by a single Act of
Parliament, the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995, running to
only 15 sections. The provisions of the Act govern, with a few
exceptions, all documents subject to Scots law signed on or after August
1 this year.
The Act makes several important changes to the law. These include the
abolition of the requirement to have witnesses of someone's signature,
although this is still a good idea as it gives the deed certain
beneficial qualities. If witnesses are used, the number required is
reduced from two to one. The use of ''adopted as holograph'' disappears.
The Act also provides that in general, people can enter into contracts,
make binding promises, or create trusts without the requirement of any
written document whatsoever, though if problems of proof are to be
avoided, writing is a good idea.
Only in limited circumstances is a written deed now necessary: in
short, for contracts and other documents relating to land, gratuitous
promises (unless given in the course of business), trusts where a person
is sole trustee of his own property, and wills.
While the Act is generally well thought out, it does cause some
headaches for lawyers (which not everyone will consider a bad thing).
For instance, the Act allows the use of unsigned schedules in certain
cases: so a will can now comprise only a few lines in which a person
leaves all their property as per an unsigned schedule. This could be a
wonderful post-death planning opportunity for an unscrupulous relative.
The biggest possible danger raised by the Act is in the area of
unintentional contracts. This danger has always existed in areas where a
written document was not required: everyone knows the danger, for
instance, of the unintended nod at an auction, or of waving at someone
on the floor of the stock market.
The Act increases the risk of unintentional contracts by allowing
people to enter into contracts where they would previously have known
they were not going to be bound until formal documentation was signed.
The danger is most apparent in the area of contracts concerning land.
Now, an exchange of informal letters, or even a conversation on the
telephone, followed by actings in reliance of the ''agreement'', could
be enough to bind parties to a deal where this was neither expected nor
intended.
The way to avoid this trap is for those negotiating property deals to
make it clear at the very beginning -- preferably in writing -- that the
discussions or negotiations are to be binding on the parties.
The best way to ensure this is to specify clearly that agreements will
not form part of a contract unless incorporated in a deed properly
witnessed under the new rules (ie, meeting the requirements of section 3
of the new Act). This should be agreed upon at stage one. If in doubt
contact your lawyer.
The above problems aside, the new Act is a godsend for lawyers trying
to ascertain exactly what legal form a particular arrangement has to be
in or how it requires to be signed, and exemplifies the clear, no
nonsense approach to the codification of the law which many recent
Scottish statutes have demonstrated.
No-one who ever had to cope with the problems of the old law will
really miss it, but like anything new in the law, most lawyers will
probably welcome the Act with a rather formal Edinburgh handshake.

Jennifer Cunningham tells how one woman's brave battle against cancer,
helped by an Edinburgh specialist, gained precious time
UNTIL her life was cruelly cut short by cancer, fortune had smiled on
Maggie Jencks. Born into the Dumfriesshire Keswick family almost
synonymous with Jardine Matheson, the world conglomerate founded by two
Scots in Hong Kong, she was a partner in Annacat, the style-setting 60s
boutique, before studying at the Architectural Association in London. It
was there she met the American architect Charles Jencks and they married
in 1978.
Her expertise extended from Chinese gardens, on which she wrote the
definitive book, to landscaping involving fibre optics. She collaborated
with the post-modern American architect, Frank Gehry on landscape
gardens in Ohio as well as designing with her husband new gardens at
Portrack, her family home near Dumfries.
On a visit there, five years after treatment for breast cancer, she
discovered that the disease had returned and had now spread to her
liver, bone, and bone marrow.
In a moving, but very positive, account of her illness and her battle
against it written before her death earlier this summer, she recalled:
''A compassionate local consultant who saw me told my husband not to
haul me round the world looking for treatments, since we could gain no
more than a brief extension of life with increasing loss of quality. How
long have we got? 'The average is three to four months . . . and I'm so
sorry, dear, but could we move you to the corridor? We have so many
patients waiting'.''
That feeling of being discarded while the medics got on with more
important tasks may seem inevitable in busy hospitals but the grain of
irritation at a great system which fell over a small hurdle bedded
itself in Maggie's mind and grew into a pearl. The idea was born of a
place where people could retreat after a diagnosis of cancer ''hits you
like a punch in the stomach'' to find information, a hot drink, a place
to think and, most importantly, privacy.
No doubt every woman in such circumstances would echo her plea for
''an old-fashioned ladies' room -- not a partitioned toilet in a row --
with its own hand-basin and a proper door in a door frame which supplies
privacy for crying, water for washing the face, and a mirror for getting
ready to deal with the world outside again.''
Neither she nor her husband was going to accept a prognosis of only
three or four months without question. Charles Jencks in particular
found himself using all his international contacts to get information
from around the world. ''In all I spoke to 30 specialists,'' he said.
As a result of those phone calls they were put in touch with Bob
Leonard who was using new techniques in Edinburgh. ''He has worked in
Boston and although he thinks many American approaches are too
aggressive, he has come to the conclusion that what needs to be done in
this country is to empower the patient. As a result, Maggie got, in her
words, a stay of execution. if not life itself.
''She had very heavy doses of chemotherapy which almost killed her,
but from January '94, she started to get really well and in April '94
she told me that she felt better than she had ever felt in her life. She
had a whole year of feeling really well and we don't really know what
the secret was because she was taking a great variety of supplements.
However, she had a year and three-quarters longer than the three months
she had been given.
''There is a huge difference between two years and three months,''
said Charles, who points out that it was vital extra time for their
teenage children to spend with their mother.
The idea of the patient taking responsibility for her own treatment is
one which slotted in naturally to the Jencks's way of looking at the
world. ''If you think of it as empowering the patient, it is part of the
whole post-modern agenda. The British attitude to medical treatment has
always been a passive one, where they regard their bodies as like cars
and when something goes wrong, expect it to be fixed mechanically. That
kind of attitude does not encourage questioning,'' Charles said.
Maggie, who had grown up in Hong Kong, found it natural to turn to
Chinese medicine. From Dr Li Ting-ming, who runs the Institute of
Chinese Medicine in London and who has trained both in Western medicine
in Edinburgh and herbal medicine in Beijing, and is herself a cancer
survivor, she received stern advice on the importance of the cancer
patient's mental attitude as well as capsules made from a Chinese
mushroom, used therapeutically for 2000 years.
She took many supplements including an immune-boosting ''soup''
developed by a Chinese biochemist at Yale and also had reflexology
sessions. Latterly she became more consciously interested in the part
played by the mind in cancer remission -- and practised yoga, Qi kung,
guided relaxation and Vipassana meditation.
Her own, life-affirming, conclusion was: ''Above all what matters most
is not to lose the joy of living in the fear of dying. Involvement in
one's own treatment is an empowering weapon in this battle. I believe it
will be proved in time to make a difference in mortality, but meantime
there is a reasonable body of evidence to suggest that patients who eat
healthily, keep active, and take steps to deal with stress and fear feel
fewer symptoms and less pain even in the final stages of their
disease.''
What matters most is not to lose the joy of living in the
fear of dying
MAGGIE'S LEGACY
A CANCER care centre offering information and support to cancer
sufferers as well as advice on nutrition, relaxation and complementary
therapies, will open next year in a former stables in the grounds of the
Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. To be known as the Maggie Keswick
Jencks Cancer Caring Centre, it is the brainchild of Maggie Jencks,
conceived as a result of her own cancer.
As a specialist nurse at the Western General, Laura Lee gave Maggie
chemotherapy. They became friends and later collaborators on the project
of realising her vision.
Together they visited a number of centres in America, borrowing and
evaluating ideas. ''Maggie wanted it to be not just for Edinburgh people
but a model which could be copied elsewhere. There is a board of
trustees coming together, but the biggest thing for us is that patients
have to feel that it is their place and not run by the hospital
bureaucracy but somewhere for them to express their emotions and try
some complementary therapies,'' said Lee.
It has the backing of the hospital and medical staff. The working
committee includes oncologist Bob Leonard and Bill McEwan from the chief
executive's office of the Western General Trust.
Richard Murphy, the award-winning Edinburgh architect whose credits
include the internal restructure of the Fruitmarket Gallery has
completed drawings which will now be put out to tender.
A fairly small building -- 30 metres long by five-and-a-half metres
wide, it will display Murphy's trademark flexibility. From one brief
stay in hospital in Livingstone, Murphy learned just how unhelpful the
physical design of hospitals are to people trying to recover.
''The key to the design is that it is an unprecedented building. It is
intended to be very unlike a hospital and the downstairs will have a
domestic feel to it,'' he said. There will be a sitting area on one side
of the middle entrance and on the other a little kitchen where people
can not only make food but also receive some practical instruction in
nutrition as well as providing a quiet place where people who have just
been diagnosed can go and not be alone.
Upstairs there will be two small balconies overlooking the downstairs
rooms, but which can be closed off with screens to make separate rooms.
One will be equipped with a TV and video and one will be available for
meetings. At the back of the downstairs space there will be a double
staircase with bookshelves and racks for leaflets forming a library with
built-in seating.
Maggie Jenck's vision included a second phase to the building. Whether
that is built largely depends on the response to the first. It would
seem a fair bet.
UNITED THEY STAND WITH SUPPORT AND ADVICE FOR CANCER SUFFERERS AND
THEIR CARERS
* THE only office of Bacup, the British Association of Cancer United
Patients, outside London opened in Glasgow several months ago. It
provides not only information and a listening ear at the other end of
the telephone, but also a range of leaflets giving both information and
advice to people with cancer and their friends and relatives.
In addition to the immediate information offered by Bacup's Scottish
co-ordinator, Jenny Whelan, five qualified counsellors offer individual
weekly counselling sessions in eight-week blocks. Their clients can come
from anywhere in Scotland and at any stage in their illness. Some look
for help immediately after diagnosis, some five years later. They also
offer post-bereavement counselling to relatives and carers.
Topics are largely initiated by the client but most want help in
clarifying what they really want from medical staff. They may want to
draw up a list of questions they want to ask. They might want to discuss
how they will deal with the answers or how to talk to their families.
Often the discussion centres on how best to help themselves, with
matters even as obvious as diet dismissed in hospital with little more
than an injunction to eat a healthy diet. Many people welcome more
detailed discussion about vitamins and supplements and whether they
should try avoiding fats, meats or stimulants, for example.
''Complementary therapies such as aromatherapy and reflexology can be
beneficial alongside medical treatment and the NHS is now beginning to
recognise this,'' said Whelan, a former chemotherapy nurse.

Scotland 1, Lithuania 0
RANGERS striker Paul McShane steered Scotland into the next round of
the European Youth Championship when he scored just 10 minutes from
time.
This was an outstanding result by a depleted Scotland squad, who had
been badly hit by a virus after their win over Estonia on Monday and
were left with only 13 fit players, including two goalkeepers.
Coach Ross Mathie said: ''It was a nightmare. Our doctor, John
MacAskill, and physio John Tierney worked flat out around the clock so
that we had just enough players.
''Reserve keeper Andrew McCondichie of Celtic was on the bench in the
dual role of substitute goalkeeper and outfield player.''
The Scots got their reward when Mark Anthony and Ross Mathieson
combined to provide the chance for that McShane winner.

By Ian Cunningham, Hillier Parker.
WITH the announcement that Sears is to sell off Freeman Hardy Willis,
the market was once again made aware of the subtle shift by many
traditional retailers from High Street to out-of-town locations.
Demonstrating their commitment to their new direction, one of Sears'
out-of-town formats, Shoe City, has recently acquired 10,000 sq ft on
the Clerical Medical scheme at Hermiston Gait Retail Park in Edinburgh.
This record Edinburgh out-of-town rental of #18 per sq ft has surprised
retailers and agents alike, making many ask whether these levels are a
taste of things to come.
Clerical Medical, not content with setting the market alight with the
Sears deal, has agreed to take back a 15,000 sq ft unit previously
prelet to Cantors, in order to remarket it at offers over #20 per sq ft.
The agents are reporting strong interest.
Incredibly, all this activity is taking place before the construction
work on the park is complete and is, in essence, still prior to any
provable custom. There seems little doubt, however, that the park will
be a success, but at what level?
Hermiston Gait is not Edinburgh's only retail park, but it is the most
successful in terms of rental levels to date. The next highest rental on
a retail park in Edinburgh is at Kinnaird Park, where Pet City has taken
a 14,175 sq ft unit at #14.25 per sq ft. Weatherall Green and Smith
acted for Pet City, which is due to open on September 1.
In addition to parks, there has been more than enough retail interest
throughout the city to dispel the talk of low consumer confidence and
struggling margins.
General Accident has recently let a new shop in the Trafalgar House
scheme at 117 Princes Street for just over #160 per sq ft Zone A. Alexon
Brands, trading as Anne Harvey, at 85a Princes Street, has sold its
lease for a premium to Sweater Shop at a level of around #150 per sq ft
Zone A.
Numbers 23 and 24 Princes Street are believed to be under offer to
mobile phone retailers and a new letting on 121a Princes Street, the
former Haagen Dazs unit, will again set new rental levels in this
stretch of Princes Street.
It is not just retail occupiers who are keen for space in central
Edinburgh. Restaurant operators have been stepping up their acquisition
activities recently and in particular, there was strong interest over
43/45 Frederick Street, where Hillier Parker is acting in letting a
restaurant for Whiteburn Projects Limited.
As a consequence, it would appear that retailer and investor interest
in Princes Street has not been affected by the Gyle Shopping Centre. The
planned extension of between eight and 10 units does not seem to be
having an effect on the demand for space on Princes Street. However,
space at the Gyle is still considerably cheaper at around #80 per sq ft
being sought for Phase II, as opposed to prime Princes Street prices of
#165 per sq ft Zone A.
The out-of-town development market in Edinburgh is very buoyant, with
retailers, house builders and developers all bidding voraciously for
sites. On the Northern General Hospital site on Ferry Road, the market
believes there were more than 12 offers at the closing date ranging from
#1.3m to #12m. The current rumour is that Safeway has narrowly beaten
Asda and Tesco to buy this site.
In a similar bidding situation in the south of the city, Sainsbury has
recently secured a site at Straiton to develop a supermarket, reportedly
at a level of #6.5m. Latest market gossip suggests that Cost Co, the
American Discount Club, has secured a site here also.
The renewed interest of the food operators not only reflects the size
and quality of the Edinburgh food market, but also the increased value
of sites, with food consents following the tightening of Central
Government controls on out-of-town development.
There is obviously some concern that the extent of shopping
out-of-town may affect the town centre, as Edinburgh District Council is
proposing a vitality and viability health check on the city centre and
is in the process of setting up a city management initiative.
The aim will be to check whether the City of Edinburgh District
Council out-of-town initiatives will have a long-term effect on the city
centre.
Interestingly, New Edinburgh Limited, the company which developed the
Gyle Centre and Hermiston Gait Retail Park (Edinburgh's two strongest
out-of-town shopping schemes), is a joint venture between Millers and
Edinburgh Development and Investment (a company wholly owned by the City
of Edinburgh District Council).
Edinburgh District Council is consulting with institutional investors
and retail operators, and has said initially that there seems to be
concern for the long-term health of Edinburgh as a shopping centre due
to the lack of convenient parking facilities.
These worries, which have been expressed by city centre retailers in
Edinburgh for some time, have been made all the more pertinent recently
with Edinburgh District Council's stated objective of reducing the
number of car parking spaces in town in order to further prevent
congestion. It seems that there is currently no cohesive approach to the
problems of Edinburgh city centre retailing versus the motor car, and
maybe the setting up of a city management initiative could go some way
towards relieving this.
What is certain is that out-of-town retailing in its present form is
here to stay and, as more retailers consider the format, demand and
rents can only grow.
In England, Environment Secretary John Gummer has made his position on
out-of-town retailing very clear, and it is his Planning Policy
Guidelines which control developments south of the Border. The Scottish
Office has only now sought to finalise its national policy guidelines on
retailing, and it seems that these will be loosely based around the
English PPG6 and PPG13.
If Scottish councils continue to defend their town centres with
restrictive planning regimes, this will drive up rentals on those sites
with planning permissions and so increase the land value of out-of-town
sites with potential for retail planning permission. This will, in turn,
make it financially worthwhile for developers to spend more time and
money in securing an appropriate planning permission.
While it is in no-one's interest to return to a laissez-faire attitude
in planning, a more cohesive approach to providing what shoppers want is
needed. Whether that be a more positive approach to the lack of
Edinburgh city centre car parking, or a more relaxed attitude to edge of
town retail proposals, is for Edinburgh District Council to decide, but
it is clear that something needs to be done.

MOTORSPORT
ALAIN Prost yesterday revealed that he will sit down for talks with
McLaren in the next few days about making his return to Formula One.
The Frenchman, who won three of his four world titles with the
Woking-based team, is considering a grand prix comeback at the age of 40
next season in a possible three-driver line-up with Mika Hakkinen and
David Coulthard.
Prost, presently testing with McLaren at Silverstone, will have to
make up his mind pretty soon. The team plan to announce their line-up at
the European Grand Prix in Germany on October 1.
But he said he would return next year even if he felt that the car
would not give him a totally competitive drive. ''In life I have learned
the most important thing is to enjoy the things I do. If I feel I can
enjoy coming back, I would.''
Prost is considering a comeback at a time when the feud between Damon
Hill and Michael Schumacher has rekindled memories of his own rivalry
with Ayrton Senna, when world championships were also decided by
crashes.
He partly laid the blame for last Sunday's crash at the Italian Grand
Prix on Hill, but added that Schumacher had been guilty of errors in the
past.
''I think it's inevitable that when you have two drivers fighting for
the championship you have one or two problems in the year,'' said Prost.
''How can you avoid that? They want to win races, want to win
championships.''

Blackburn 0, Spartak Moscow 1
SERGEI Yuran, the Champions' Cup scourge of Arsenal four years ago,
turned up last night to haunt Blackburn and deepen the gloom settling
over Ewood Park. The 26-year-old celebrated his first goal for Spartak
Moscow since returning to Russia after helping Bobby Robson's Porto to
the Cup-winners' quarter-finals last season.
He left England pair Tim Flowers and Graeme Le Saux heaped in
embarrassment with a 40-minute breakaway goal that confirmed the
pessimistic assessment of Rovers' second venture into Europe.
This was a much better show than the Trelleborgs disaster, but a home
defeat leaves them facing an awesome task now to qualify from Champions'
League Group B, which also includes Legia Warsaw and next opponents,
Rosenborg of Norway.
To make matters worse both Alan Shearer and Colin Hendry, the two
bulwarks of the side, collected bookings which could have serious
repercussions later in the six-match series.
Ewood was 10,000 under capacity for such an historic night as if even
their own fans have lost faith in the team, and their fears were
realised as Mark Atkins' corner from the right was booted clear to
Valeri Schmarov on the halfway line.
He turned it straight on for Yuran to burst between Henning Berg and
Le Saux. Flowers did not need to dash off his line and succeeded only in
colliding with his England team-mate while the Russian lobbed the ball
into the empty net from 20 yards.
Ray Harford's decision to bench #5m man Chris Sutton was again
justified, Mike Newell working hard to support Shearer and, in fact, had
the better chances. He headed over from Stuart Ripley's corner after 20
minutes and moments later forced a fabulous save from Tchertchesov.
Controlling Ripley's cross from the right off his chest, he met the
falling ball with a cracking 18-yard, right-foot volley which the
goalkeeper only just beat out from inside his right-hand post.
However, Blackburn remain defiant. ''We should not have any shame
about that,'' said Shearer. ''We created numerous chances and with
better finishing, who knows what might have happened?''
The Russians, who are unbeaten now in seven games against English
sides, insist they still fear Rovers, who go to Moscow in November.
Coach Oleg Romantsev said: ''We have not won the argument -- it's merely
been adjourned until we meet again.''
Ray Harford, said: ''I was very proud of the team. We played with
typical Englishness fast, high tempo football and I honestly thought we
deserved something out of it. Maybe we didn't match them technically,
but I can't fault our passion and effort. That's the best we've played
this season.''

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
By Sally Gandon, Gandon Pender.
THE key to good property management is communication. Everyone,
including owners and occupiers, understands the need for properties to
be managed and the basic principles that apply. However, how that is
applied and the costs involved can often lead to controversy between
landlords and tenants, much of which could be avoided if both parties
communicated with each other.
Historically, many landlords have employed managing agents to run
buildings on their behalf and to deal with the tenants on a day-to-day
basis. Unfortunately, most managing agents have tended to manage
properties without consulting the occupiers and therefore without a full
understanding of their requirements.
The main issue in the management of properties which tends to lead to
controversy between landlord and tenant is the spending of significant
amounts of money on one-off repairs or refurbishment to common areas of
the building without any prior consultation or agreement with the
tenants.
One view is that landlords and tenants should communicate with each
other and agree on the need for works before proceeding. For example, in
a multi-occupied office building with four tenants it seems only
sensible that if the landlord is intending to refurbish the common parts
and reclaim all the costs from the tenants, that they have some input
into the design and quality of the scheme. After all, it is the tenant
who will have to live with the scheme on a daily basis.
Careful planning can, it is claimed, keep the costs of running a
building consistent.
A good example of how a planned approach towards management actually
works out can be found at 375 West George Street, Glasgow, a 60,000sq ft
office building managed on behalf of Inoco plc. The managing agents have
consistently set aside an amount of approximately #20,000 per annum for
either internal or external repairs and redecoration. The total service
charge is in the region of #2 per sq ft and has run consistently at this
level for the past five years.
This is a sensible and affordable level, and at the same time the
building is well repaired and maintained. The tenants are kept fully
informed of work proposed for the building each year and any suggestions
or comments they have are taken into account.

By Graham Wiseman, Donald Stewart &amp; Co.
FOR those in business who may not be familiar with Ayr and the
South-west it is possible this district may hold a number of surprises.
In a recent quality of life survey carried out in 1990, Kyle and Carrick
District was voted second in the UK -- behind Perth.
Ayr is well-known as a Clyde coastal holiday resort with tourism worth
around #185m a year and responsible for some 9000 jobs.
On a more practical level, Ayr has consistently been within the top
five retail centres in Scotland (behind Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and
Dundee) by virtue of the number and variety of retailers who have been
chosen to be represented within the town's bustling centre. This
distinction has been founded on the town's wide catchment, estimated to
be close to 250,000, stretching as far north as Glasgow and towards
Stranraer in the south.
The effects of the recession linger in Ayr as they do in all other
major centres throughout the country. However, there is a general
feeling within the town that this region has not been so badly affected
as many other areas. Major employers such as British Aerospace, Digital,
Volvo and Caledonian Paper plc continue to prosper and expand, while
there are a host of smaller evolving companies who have chosen to
develop within this district. Prestwick Airport continues to expand both
as a passenger and a freight terminal.
The widely publicised protests in connection with the M77 Glasgow to
Ayr route are viewed with some dismay by many in the business community
since this is a vital and long overdue extension to the region's road
infrastructure. Its completion will be most welcome.
Ayr's High Street was the subject of a #2m traffic and transportation
action plan from 1991 until last year, making it a pedestrian priority
scheme with only one-way northbound traffic permitted. Pavements were
widened to reduce crossing distances and give more space for shoppers.
Bus bays, servicing areas and parking bays for the disabled were
provided but all other on-street parking was prohibited.
If this scheme was to the obvious benefit of the High Street then once
established secondary retail streets are taking the brunt of changing
shopping patterns; Kyle Street and Smith Street do seem to be toiling
somewhat.
The Top of the Town is also going through a period of marked change
with Parkhouse Street perceived to be the preferred choice for many
Class II users. The decision to remove the Tourist Information Office
away from its established base at Newmarket Street/Sandgate seems to
have been ill-founded and was certainly not a popular move with local
traders, many being historically reliant upon tourists.
Despite many market commentaries suggesting the retail property market
in Scotland could be showing some signs of initial recovery there has,
up until the past few months, been little significant evidence locally
to suggest greatly improved occupational demand.
However, after a period of significant lethargy we are beginning to
see some improvement in the levels of interest and inquiries, and if
this can be sustained we may be able to report an increase in lettings
accompanied by the potential for further growth.
Various reports would indicate that prime shops in the main centres of
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen are enjoying steady demand with
reasonable growth. However, increases in retail spending have been
insufficient to encourage demand in what has been a debilitated and
arduous market. Ayr, Kilmarnock and Irvine are all similarly affected,
with only Kilmarnock producing any sustained growth in prime shop
rentals which are now at least on a par with Ayr.
Recent lettings in Ayr's High Street seem to be underpinning prime
Zone A rates at least at #55 per sq ft. The introduction of empty rates
liabilities has perhaps encouraged some landlords to offer increasingly
more flexible terms and this is a situation which we know to be mirrored
across much of the country.
On Ayr's High Street our database suggests that there is approximately
15,300 sq ft of retail space either available or under offer with a
further 12,000 sq ft available in the Kyle Centre, Ayr's principal
retail mall.
Perhaps the most exciting development within Ayr town centre will be
the redevelopment of the Dalblair Shopping Arcade to be renamed the
Arran Mall. The redevelopment by British Ensign Investments Limited will
be at an anticipated cost of #1m and it is hoped that phase one of this
will be completed before the end of the year.
Out of town, Ayr's Heathfield Retail Park is a 136,000 sq ft retail
warehouse development; an outstanding planning application for an
additional superstore in the Heathfield area has in fact been called in
by the Secretary of State for Scotland with a decision unlikely before
well into next year. This decision will obviously have a significant
impact upon this region's shopping patterns for many years to come.
As the principal commercial real estate consultant in Ayr, we have
experienced a steady if unspectacular demand for traditional townhouse
office accommodation with rents of between #8 and #9 achievable in Ayr.
Equivalent rates in Irvine are nearer #7, falling to around #5 or #6 in
Kilmarnock. Much of the demand tends to be local professional firms
whose preferred choice is to purchase.
Finally there is the question of local government reorganisation, with
Ayr remaining the principal town in the new South Ayrshire District. All
market sectors should be well-placed to benefit from what should be more
efficient services and increased local authority personnel.
In conclusion, there is certainly an air of increasing optimism within
Ayr's property market and this is radiating throughout most of the
South-west as evidenced by increases in institutional investment. If the
economy and inflation can be managed in the future, the area is well
placed to derive benefit from numerous proposed developments with
potential for sustainable growth.

MOTORSPORT
ALAIN Prost yesterday revealed that he will sit down for talks with
McLaren in the next few days about making his return to Formula One.
The Frenchman, who won three of his four world titles with the
Woking-based team, is considering a grand prix comeback at the age of 40
next season in a possible three-driver line-up with Mika Hakkinen and
David Coulthard.
Prost, presently testing with McLaren at Silverstone, will have to
make up his mind pretty soon. The team plan to announce their line-up at
the European Grand Prix in Germany on October 1.
But he said he would return next year even if he felt that the car
would not give him a totally competitive drive. ''In life I have learned
the most important thing is to enjoy the things I do. If I feel I can
enjoy coming back, I would.''
Prost is considering a comeback at a time when the feud between Damon
Hill and Michael Schumacher has rekindled memories of his own rivalry
with Ayrton Senna, when world championships were also decided by
crashes.
He partly laid the blame for last Sunday's crash at the Italian Grand
Prix on Hill, but added that Schumacher had been guilty of errors in the
past.
''I think it's inevitable that when you have two drivers fighting for
the championship you have one or two problems in the year,'' said Prost.
''How can you avoid that? They want to win races, want to win
championships.''

RUGBY
FRENCH rugby has decided against turning professional, the president
of its national federation said yesterday.
He said the players would be able to earn money but not a salary.
French federation president Bernard Lapasset, who chairs the IRB, told
a Paris news conference: ''French rugby has chosen not to become
professional.''
* New Zealand will play four test matches at home during the 1996
season -- at four different venues -- against Scotland, Australia and
South Africa.
Scotland will play the All Blacks at Dunedin on June 15 and in
Auckland on June 22. New Zealand will play Australia at Wellington and
will meet South Africa in Christchurch, although dates for those matches
have still to be confirmed.
* New Zealand World Cup star Jonah Lomu faces the axe from his
provincial side Counties, after missing a training session to go to the
theatre.
The giant All Black winger attended a performance of the musical,
Cats, instead of joining preparations for Counties' match against
Auckland.
Lomu had been suffering from blood poisoning after a leg injury but
Counties coach Mac McCallion was unimpressed, saying: ''I'm not happy
with the way it's worked out. I'll make a decision whether he'll be
playing after training tomorrow.''

HOLDERS Ajax Amsterdam sent a clear message to all pretenders that
they will not easily surrender their crown when they beat six-times
winners Real Madrid 1-0 in their Champions' League group D match in
Amsterdam.
Ajax, with teenage striker Patrick Kluivert missing out of respect for
the family of a man who died in a collision with the player's car last
weekend, and skipper Danny Blind and Arnold Scholten suspended, coach
Louis van Gaal was forced to bring in more of his youngsters.
But it was international winger Marc Overmars who earned the points,
finding space and time after 14 minutes to run at the Madrid defence and
beat Buyo with a low right-foot shot that squeezed inside the post from
20 metres.
Vitaly Kosovsky scored in the sixty-first minute to give Dynamo Kiev
an unimpressive 1-0 victory over Panathinaikos of Greece in their
opening Champions' League Group A match.
The Ukrainians controlled most of the lacklustre match in Kiev, but
squandered a string of chances to put the issue beyond doubt earlier in
front of 85,000 fans.
Panathinaikos's best opportunity in the first half came when
Alexandros Alexoudis fired a free-kick just wide in the twenty-eighth
minute. He came close again 15 minutes from time when his header from a
corner struck the crossbar.
* IRISH part-timers Glenavon were beaten 2-0 by Werder Bremen despite
a battling display in last night's UEFA Cup first-round, first-leg tie
at Mourneview Park in Lurgan.
Glenavon played almost throughout with nine players at the back,
strikers Stephen McBride and Glenn Ferguson the only men kept up front
on the chance of a counter-attack.
Werder, who showed pace and superb skill, became frustrated when they
could not get the breakthrough. But after 59 minutes McBride lost
possession and the ball was played through to Argentinian forward
Rodolfo Cardoso, who beat two defenders and slid the ball into the net.
Glenavon goalkeeper Dermott O'Neill was his side's hero, producing six
superb saves including a double effort midway through the second half.
But Glenavon conceded a second goal two minutes from the end when
substitute Angelo Vier headed home a left-wing cross from fellow
substitute Frank Neubarth.
Despite the scoreline, Glenavon manager Nigel Best was delighted with
the performance of his men.
''I was proud of them all. It was a respectable result and it's a pity
Bremen got their second goal just before the finish,'' he said.
Werder Bremen coach Aad de Moss was more than satisfied with the lead
his side will take to the return leg in Germany.
''They made it hard for us but everyone played to instructions and I'm
confident we'll make it into the next round,'' commented de Moss.

THE BRITISH MASTERS
SEVE Ballesteros yesterday joined the growing band who state that
Colin Montgomerie is currently the world's best golfer. Ballesteros gave
his view on the eve of the pair's appearance in the #650,000 British
Masters at Collingtree Park, near Northampton -- and told fans not to
worry about his own form with the Ryder Cup only a week away.
Montgomerie had his second victory in three weeks at the Lancome
Trophy in Paris on Sunday. Although the Scot has remained No.6 in the
world rankings, Ballesteros said: ''One of the most positive things
about our team is that we carry the best player in the world right now.
If I could choose anybody to partner next week I would choose him.''
The Spanish star is looking for a new partner after Jose Maria
Olazabal's withdrawal through injury on Monday. But it is unlikely to be
Montgomerie, who expects to be paired again with Nick Faldo, with whom
he lost only one out of four games two years ago.
Ballesteros spoke to European captain Bernard Gallacher yesterday, but
commented: ''Nothing was decided. There's plenty of time next week to
decide the partnerships.''
After missing six of his previous seven halfway cuts, Ballesteros
finished joint fourteenth on Sunday. ''I don't think anybody should
worry or feel negative about my form,'' he said. ''I will do my best and
I am capable of beating anybody at any time. It's matchplay -- you don't
have to keep a score.''
Nine of the European side play this week -- only Faldo, Bernhard
Langer, and Costantino Rocca are missing -- and the defending champion
is Ian Woosnam, the man called in to replace Olazabal.
The Welshman has not won since the same event was staged at Woburn 12
months ago, but, thanks to a book on positive thinking, is sounding a
lot happier with life than he was a few weeks ago.
The book is called ''NLP'', which stands for Neuro Linguistic
Programming. ''A few weeks ago I was having lunch with a businessman and
he recommended this book. It's got me thinking a bit different,'' said
Woosnam.
''I'm not really into books and I've not finished this one yet, but
I'm being more positive about things now, especially my putting.''
This week's tournament lost sponsors Dunhill in January and talks with
another company fell through two months ago. It was due to be televised
by BBC, but Sky are now covering it after agreeing to make what
tournament director Peter German today described as ''a substantial
contribution''.
The final round, due to end on Sunday, will be shown by both
companies, live on Sky and then soon afterwards by the BBC.
Millions may have wanted the same arrangement from the Ryder Cup next
week, but Sky have the exclusive contract and BBC can show only a
maximum of two minutes per day on news bulletins.

By Nick Roberts, building sales division, DM Hall.
FOR a long time now, a lot of property agents -- including ourselves
-- felt we ought to comment every time we spotted an apparent
improvement in the market.
These usually happen when there's a sporadic burst of activity in the
register of properties for sale. But over the past 18 months most of
these apparent recoveries have been short-lived.
Recently, however, there is sustained evidence that things are getting
better in one particular area -- the licensed trade.
When I talk to my colleagues in the business sales world, we find
ourselves agreeing that certain things are happening. First-time buyers
are beginning to appear, more experienced individuals are trading up,
and some of the smaller groups are expanding. Another helpful
development is that some of the lenders who were hard hit by the
recession are willing to invest in licensed premises again.
If you look closely at the market -- particularly at those businesses
and properties which are selling quicker than others -- it's clear that
the most popular properties are those which have been repossessed or
closed down.
Most of these are bought by developers or multiple operators. Where
developers are involved, many of the buildings which were originally
residential dwellings are going back to their original use.
Purpose-built licensed properties, particularly those on local
authority estates, often need strong, experienced management to be
successful, but in the right hands they can make money again. While
properties such as these usually have a low market value, this makes
them easy to fund.
Well-established businesses are another growth market. The Criffel
Inn, in the village of New Abbey, sold quickly. This particular business
had a good reputation locally and had been well run for a long time. It
had been in the same ownership for 45 years.
What helped the sale enormously was that the owners were able to
produce several years of accounting records, and -- more important --
audited profit and loss accounts for the past three years. Both sets of
figures showed a consistently strong trading record with healthy
profits. This in turn gave both the buyer and the lender the confidence
to proceed.
Businesses like The Criffel Inn are always popular when they come into
the open market. The days when silly money changed hands for ''desirable
business opportunities'' are gone forever, but sales like this add some
stability to a market which has experienced long plunging prices over
the past four years.
Some smaller group operators have appeared on the scene recently and
some of the larger ones have expanded, and there has been an important
change in attitude on the part of the operators -- and the general
public.
At long last the Scottish licensed trade seems to have acknowledged
the significance of the family -- and how important leisure time is
while people are enjoying a meal and a drink.
Whitbread led the way with its Brewers Fayre concept of
family-orientated cafeteria pubs, with children's secure play areas
inside and outside. This has expanded dramatically over the past few
months, and smaller operators are also beginning to recognise the
opportunities.
Last month an experienced restaurateur, Bert D'Agostino, launched his
new Topolinos idea in Edinburgh. This offers a secure, child-safe
environment on two levels, with children's play areas and a toy train
with ''restaurant cars''. Adults can eat elsewhere in the building
without being disturbed by children playing around them.
Some of the major brewers are looking closely at their family
restaurant concepts, and I have no doubt that other eating places on the
same lines will open shortly.
There's a glimmer of life out there. The banks are keen to lend money
at the moment, all they need are viable proposals which have been
soundly researched.
Times have been tough for the business sales market and the licensed
trade in general over the past few years. But it's important to remember
there are highs and lows in every sector. The market has been slow
recently -- but it always is at this time of the year.
And this is just one of the many factors which affect sales. Regional
variations, interest rates, a change in company policy or a change of
government, all play their part.
I'm not going to fall into the trap of crystal ball gazing, as all of
us have done in the past. But some light is visible at the end of the
tunnel.

By Stuart Ferguson, Christie &amp; Co.
AFTER a difficult last couple of years for the public house property
market in the West of Scotland, there are signs that a recovery is on
the way, but it is still very much a buyers' market.
There is a healthy number of pubs for sale, although probably no more
than during the buoyant period of five to six years ago, but not enough
purchasers around to stimulate the market. Those pubs which are on offer
have been for sale for longer because of the big reduction in the number
of buyers.
One of the other problems which is hindering activity is the lack of
quality businesses available, which many of the experienced and
corporate purchasers want to acquire. There are a good number of pubs
for the first-time buyer available, but a shortage of first-time buyers.
Activity in general is quiet, but there are several experienced and
corporate purchasers looking around, such as Eagle Taverns. However,
these buyers are more particular and exact as to the type, area and
style of pubs they wish to buy.
While the maxim ''location, location, location'' is still important,
buyers are more concerned about value for money in relation to other
businesses for sale, and attractive returns on turnover and profit
achieved.
While the good times of the late eighties are over, and it is
questionable whether we will see a similar situation again, public
houses continue to be bought and sold and deals are taking place.
It still remains the case that pubs which stand the best chance of
selling are those which are competitively priced, and where sellers are
prepared to be flexible on cash. As there are more pubs available than
buyers, the buyers do have a choice, and will inevitably purchase those
pubs which give better value for money.
In general terms, buyers will no longer pay for ''potential'', and in
most cases will pay a fair price. Sellers should also bear in mind that
surveyors and valuers instructed by purchasers in order to obtain bank
borrowing are also cautious. If their pubs are over-priced this will be
picked up by the purchaser's valuer. Certainly, recent sales would
suggest that we are edging towards an atmosphere of stability in terms
of price. Purchase prices being paid are more realistic, and if anything
we have returned to pre ''boom'' days.
City centre and town public houses, either leasehold or freehold, with
reasonable barrelage are continuing to be in demand and sales are taking
place. However, there is still a shortage of these, with current owners
preferring to hold on to their assets.
Recently a basement leasehold public house in Sauchiehall Street,
Glasgow, sold from an asking price of #200,000 without being advertised,
a good example of good quality leasehold public houses with leases of up
to 25 years still attracting interest. It is, however, mainly cash and
experienced purchasers who are able to fund the acquisition of these
units, as banks are not keen to lend on leaseholds unless there is other
security to back up the loan.
The Clansman Bar, a freehold unit in Kilmarnock, was recently sold to
Dean Entertainment Ltd, based in Kirkcaldy, one of the larger private
corporate groups in Scotland. The Clansman, along with the Bellfield
Tavern, a leasehold unit also in Kilmarnock, were sold within weeks of
coming on to the market, while pubs such as the Left Bank, Prestwick,
and the Manor Bar, Hamilton, attracted a large amount of interest before
being sold to local publicans.
At the corporate end, unlike many parts of England, there have been no
significant portfolio sales of pubs. In 1993, Carnegies Leisure Group
sold a large number of its freehold and leasehold pubs to Scottish &amp;
Newcastle Retail, and in 1994 Standard Taverns Ltd, a Glasgow-based
corporate, sold its entire estate to Tennents Taverns Ltd.
Their have been no similar deals so far this year and no significant
brewery disposals. The smaller pub groups are in the main still seeking
to acquire, but their growth has been restricted by the lack of quality
which they seek.
In terms of activity among the brewers, Whitbread and Bass still
remain the most acquisitive for individual sites and units. Whitbread
are continuing to expand their chain of Beefeaters, Brewers Fayres and
Travel Inns and they remain very good trading outlets. Over the past
year they have introduced their cask ale chain Hogs Head to Glasgow,
Dundee and Stirling.
Bass also has an acquisition programme and acquired a number of
trading units and developed various sites throughout Scotland in the
past year. They acquired the Carousel Bar, Stirling, through Christie &amp;
Co from Stirling-based Castle Leisure Group. After acquiring this site,
they introduced an Irish-style theme bar and renamed the pub O'Neills,
creating almost overnight a healthy and thriving unit.
There is no doubt that today's buyer is better prepared, has a sound
business plan, knows what type of business he wants and will investigate
the best source of funding. He will no doubt have bought a pub at a
realistic purchase price.

WEST OF SCOTLAND RETAIL.
By J Fraser Smith, director, Smith Cole Wright.
AS we move towards the chillier winds of autumn, retailers are taking
stock of their gains and losses in the hottest summer for more than 200
years.
Products such as sunglasses, salad dressing and barbecue sets have
seen their sales shoot up. Others have suffered. Sales of chocolate and
DIY goods have collapsed.
Long after the temperatures have cooled, this summer's effect will be
felt on company balance sheets.
As always, the heat has benefited the sales of soft drinks and ice
cream, with Cadbury Schweppes and Coca Cola working round the clock to
meet demand, which is up 30% on last year. Grand Metropolitan's
Haagen-Dazs was recently quoted as selling 45,000 scoops of ice cream a
week in its flagship store in London's Leicester Square and reports
sales 23% up in July.
The heat has been too much for some companies and they are happy to
see rain. The DIY groups have been among the hardest hit with B&amp;Q, the
market leader, expecting to report a fall in profits when parent company
Kingfisher report interim figures next month.
The good weather has also seriously affected foreign holidays and at
the start of July, nearly one quarter of the #10m package deals remained
unsold. The Scottish invasion of tourists from England and abroad
coupled with the new breed of ''stay at home Scots'' has immensely
helped the home-grown tourism market, and not before time. Hopefully,
this will result in further re-investment in a country which has so much
to offer.
And to those people who have remained in their back garden rather than
book a holiday, where are they spending their money? Reports show that
the money is either being saved or spent carefully, which is not
surprising in a time of uncertainty and short-term employment contracts.
There is, however, a ''feelgood factor'' associated with the good
weather which certainly attracts people on to the streets. The need to
shop is severely diluted as a result of the limited stock range so late
in the season, at a time when normally the sale of autumn and winter
garments is in full swing.
It is, of course, difficult for retailers to take money when consumers
are still in the mood for bargain hunting in the summer sales, and I
fear there will be a degree of stockpiling until the weather breaks.
The pressure being placed upon some retailers by manufacturers has, of
course, added to the difficulties in the High Street and during the
first quarter of 1995, some 58 retailers went into receivership.
While this trend has slowed down, there are still profit warnings
reported from some of the big names, including WH Smith, Kingfisher and
Austin Reid. It is therefore inevitable that manufacturers are on edge
and understandably, steps must be taken if the retailers who sell their
product go bust.
Openings are therefore emerging for direct manufacturers' sales
outlets including Nike, The Sweater Shop, Ortak and Racing Green, and we
should also expect to see increased promotion for catalogue and
telephone sales.
A further consequence will be factory outlet shopping, which has been
discussed in Scotland over the past few years, and positive efforts have
been made in Stirling by McArthur Glen, in Kinross by Guinea Properties
and more recently in Bathgate by The Value Retail Consortium.
Scotland is a nation of consumers with an eye for a bargain, and the
introduction of a factory outlet mall, where manufacturers sell goods
direct to the public at discounted prices, should be highly successful
if managed correctly.
This has already has been experienced by Clarks in its retail village
in Street, as well as in Fleetwood and Hornsea. This concept will be
refreshing news to the market. However, I would anticipate strong
objection to the sites in question due to the effect on adjacent town
centres. This is merely a delay in the introduction of factory outlet
shopping to Scotland.
Retail activity over the summer months has been fairly static, but
there are definite signs of movement as retailers have focused on the
direction their company must take to retain and expand their slice of
the market.
Sears for example, while planning to offload 300 stores, is also
intending to open 150 new outlets. Units of the wrong size or in the
wrong place will be removed from their portfolio and the market is
certainly experiencing a higher take-up of space, which should result in
some action on the High Street in the coming months.
And so, why is there a more optimistic view in the market, despite the
doom and gloom being preached by many and sales volumes having remained
static for nearly a year?
It is all partly due to the fact that the consumer and the retailer
have accepted that the market will never improve to the levels
previously experienced. It is time to get off the fence and take steps
to adjust to the situation, as it will probably remain for some time to
come.
Retailers must give the consumer exactly what he or she demands at the
right price, and despite the pundits extolling the underlying health of
the UK economy, most households have adapted to work within their
budgets -- just in case a cold winter is lying around the corner.
Retailing in the West of Scotland is experiencing a similar pattern to
the rest of the UK, and we are pleased to report increased activity in
the market. This should result in some new names to the High Street,
although it is now too late for Christmas openings, and spring should
see the next facelift on the High Street.
Substantial efforts will be made by retailers in the run-up to
Christmas to entice shoppers to spend, which may produce exciting new
items and garments into the market at competitive prices. As for the
good weather -- may we have the same next summer.

NEW TOWNS
By Paul Dempsey, Drivers Jonas.
THE ultimate demise of the Scottish New Town Development Corporations
is fast approaching. East Kilbride and Glenrothes New Towns will wind-up
in December while the remaining three towns of Cumbernauld, Livingston
and Irvine will follow in December next year.
Much has been written on the introduction of the private sector into
the New Town markets and the effect on existing businesses. Although the
preservation of these businesses is vital, it is important to look at
who will provide industrial accommodation in the future, now that a
major supplier of space is no longer in the market, and whether Scotland
can continue to attract inward investment in what has become an
increasingly competitive global market.
Scotland has had notable successes in attracting and maintaining
inward investment with companies such as NEC, Motorola and OKI
establishing and expanding manufacturing facilities. These have become
more than just satellite factories and now form an integral part of the
respective companies' world-wide manufacturing base.
Much of the success in attracting this investment has been due to the
New Town Development Corporations combining their skills with that of
the national inward investment agencies such as Scottish Enterprise and
Locate In Scotland. In order to ensure that major employers continue to
be attracted to Scotland, close relationships between national inward
investment agencies and the new landlords must continue.
The reasons for a company's relocation decisions are many and varied,
but essentially key decisions are made by looking at the most basic of
economic principles: labour, capital and land -- the factors of
production.
From our own discussions with a number of multi-national companies
expanding in Scotland, the primary reason for choosing to expand an
existing facility in Scotland as opposed to an existing factory
elsewhere in Europe, or even in some cases the Far East, is the
workforce. The Scottish workforce now enjoys an enviable reputation as
being well trained, flexible and enthusiastic. This fact is unlikely to
be affected by the demise of the development corporations as education
and training continue to be the remit of Government, Scottish Enterprise
and, on a more local level, the Local Enterprise Companies.
Looking at the issue of capital, although incentives have been
provided locally by the corporations, major funding has come from
central sources via tax incentives, training grants, etc. In order to
continue to compete effectively, generous levels of incentives must
continue if we are to face up to increasing competition from countries
such as Ireland.
Turning now to the main issue: will the wind-up of the New Towns
affect inward investment, given that there may be no new provision of
modern industrial premises?
Essentially, I do not believe that there is a lack of modern
industrial accommodation, particularly given developments such as
Kingsthorne Park at Livingston, Hamilton International Technology Park,
Kelvin South Business Park at East Kilbride and the Euro Terminal at
Mossend, the first phases of which are now complete and awaiting
occupation.
However, even if only a fraction of these schemes were available, I do
not believe that a significant number of occupiers would base their
location decision solely on the existence or not, of an immediately
available new factory.
Modern manufacturing businesses that are likely to be attracted to
Scotland such as pharmaceuticals, plastics and telecoms/electronics,
have such advanced and sophisticated production techniques that their
main investment of time and money is not devoted to bricks and mortar or
steel and aluminium, but in the fit-out of property for their own
specialised use.
To their credit, the development corporations have not decreased their
activities as wind-up approaches. In East Kilbride, for example, the
corporation developed the second phase of Kelvin South Business Park and
transferred ownership to the district council on completion. All of the
corporations have been keen to ensure that the handover from the public
to private sector operates as smoothly as possible, with close liaison
continuing both with regard to potential occupiers and ongoing
programmes of repair and refurbishment, once the sale is complete.
In addition, the Local Enterprise Companies, working with Locate in
Scotland, have acquired strategic assets from the corporations. Although
not seeing themselves as being direct providers, they have also
participated in the development of a limited number of advanced
factories to overcome lack of supply in certain areas and size ranges.
Good examples of this are Hamilton International and Kingshorne Park.
This close liaison must continue and public/private sector
relationships must strengthen in the future if the momentum is not to be
lost, and Scotland is to continue to be a desirable location for
business.

Livingston 2, St Mirren 0
ST MIRREN crashed out of the League Challenge Cup to third division
Livingston at soggy Meadowbank last night. Two goals in the final 15
minutes -- a penalty from substitute Jason Young and a strike from Chris
Sinclair -- were enough to sink Saints.
Jim Leishman's side showed a distinct lack of respect to their first
division opponents. St Mirren are the fourth higher division side they
have accounted for in cup competitions this season.
St Mirren manager Jimmy Bone said: ''It was a terrible performance --
simple as that. We never looked like scoring even if we'd played until
midnight.
Livingston missed David Alleyne in midfield but, after weathering
early pressure, created chances towards the end of the first half.
Young came on in 73 minutes and scored from the spot five minutes
later. Then came Sinclair's goal in 85 minutes after another McMartin
pass.

JUVENTUS hit back after conceding a goal in the first minute to score
a 3-1 win over Borussia Dortmund in their opening Champions' League
match in Dortmund.
The Italians, in Rangers' group and looking to become European
champions for the first time since 1985, went behind when their former
midfielder Andreas Moeller scored for Dortmund after only 38 seconds.
He swooped on to a loose ball and fired it past goalkeeper Angelo
Peruzzi with the rain-soaked crowd still settling into their seats.
But it took the visitors only 12 minutes to pull level through Michele
Padovano. Alessandro Del Piero scored after 37 minutes, and the
20-year-old forward also had a hand in Juventus's third when his pass in
69 minutes found Antonio Conte, who headed home.
While Del Piero was Juventus' outstanding player, Moeller shone for
the Germans against his former team-mates, and rattled the ball off an
upright in the thirty-first minute as Dortmund tried to come back into
the match.
Dutch internationalist Marc Overmars gave Ajax a flying start to the
defence of their title by beating six-times winners Real Madrid in
Amsterdam.
Overmars, a rumoured target for Manchester United this summer, scored
after 14 minutes to clinch a 1-0 victory in their opening group D match.
But Hungarians Ferencvaros became the early leaders of the group on
goal difference following their comprehensive 3-0 win over Grasshoppers
in Zurich.
Legia Warsaw striker Leszek Pisz continued to be a thorn in the flesh
of Scandinavian rivals with two goals as the Polish champions came from
behind to beat Rosenborg 3-1 at home in Group C.
Pisz, who scored in the preliminary round tie against IFK Gothenburg,
equalised in the sixty-fourth minute, one minute after Jahn Ivar
Jakobsen had put the Norwegians ahead. Ryszard Staniek and Pisz added
goals in the sixty-ninth and seventy-third minutes.
Under-strength French champions Nantes were held to a goalless draw by
Porto in Group A.
Nantes, without injured striker Nicolas Ouedec and suspended
midfielders Jean-Michel Ferri and Reynald Pedros, were put under fierce
pressure by Porto, but dominated the 1987 European champions in the
later stages.
Dynamo Kiev are the early leaders in the group after claiming an
unimpressive 1-0 home victory over Panathinaikos of Greece, Vitaly
Kosovsky scoring the winner.

GHK 11, West of Scotland 22
IT was second division, second class, and as the seconds wore out,
there was a great deal of waiting for the final whistle. Bill McMurdo,
the agent, was sitting watching in the main stand. ''I'm here on a fact
finding mission about how club rugby works,'' he said. And how did he
find it? ''Restful. Very restful,'' he said.
For restful read that these two teams, arguably the best in the city
of Glasgow, put on a show that was woefully inadequate at times, and to
forget and ignore that fact would be to do both of them, despite their
obvious endeavours, and a one man show of genuine class by West's Dave
Barrett, who scored all of his side's points with a try, a conversion
and five penalties, an injustice. ''I'm delighted that we won, and it
takes a bit of pressure off our young team,'' said West forward coach
Gordon MacPherson after the game. ''And people shouldn't forget that we
have four under 20's in the pack. We have some good players, but the
pressure is on us to keep them, which we will only do if we go up.''
GHK, many peoples' favourite for promotion this season, will now be
plunged into despair at having lost their first three outings on the
trot, and to even suggest that a team that played like their's did last
night deserves a first division place on this kind of showing would be
greeted by chortles from your average Borderer. And that gives nobody in
the city any joy. The players, though, must understand that if they are
to go places in Glasgow clubs, then they have to be far fitter, far
stronger, far more skilful, far better cheats, and far more committed,
and far more brutal. You could tell by looking at the builds of some of
the players, compared to the average Edinburgh and Borders player, that
they treat this sport as a past time. And that's just not good enough.
For West, Gordon and Alan Bulloch looked a class apart, the hooker
Gordon looks like a man who can take an extra step into a tackle, and
Fraser Stott despite the trademark red funk -- he ran a penalty with
minutes remaining when his side was 11 points up -- had an eager game.
Guy Perrett in the second row reaped some lineout ball, and John
Lonergan was, as is usual for Lonergan, everywhere.
GHK, by contrast, had few successes apart from the occasional rolling
maul and some lineout ball from Cecil du Plessis, who will have to do
more to prove his pedigree, and Kenny Wilson.
George Breckenridge opened the game with a shock try for GHK,
accepting a pass from Steve Hirini and gliding down the right wing and
swerving to score, but he spoiled his match with some aimless kicking
and no more points were to come for GHK until Barrett had banged over
four penalties as West applied all the pressure in a snooze-filled first
half. Harri Bassi then converted two penalties, amid what looked to be a
poor refereeing display from before Barrett charged down a Breckenridge
clearance kick, Hirini fumbled the pick up, and the West stand off
plunged over to score. Two more of his penalties and the scoring was
finished.
''Get the merger cry going,'' said MacPherson after the game. He's
right. Of the two teams, West have the better youngsters and the clearer
future in my view. They looked fitter and they had greater purpose. But,
absolutely frankly, neither of these two sides, even with Shade Munro
and Alan Watt back for GHK, are long term bets for a steady spot in the
first division, and until people recognise that there might not be a
Glasgow city side up there. Somebody, somewhere, please get their act
together. This was depressing. And the paltry crowd knew it.
GHK -- H Bassi, G Agnew, S Little, S Hirini, G Hawkes, G Breckenridge,

Selkirk 15, Kelso 7
KELSO went down to their third successive defeat in a less than
stirring match at Philiphaugh. But if Kelso coach Eric Paxton was
disappointed at his charge's display, his opposite number John
Rutherford found difficulty in expressing much satisfaction in Selkirk's
win.
The former Scotland stand-off said he was happy that Selkirk got the
points for their second league win, but ''not with the way we played
tonight''.
It was in truth a patchy display by both sides, punctuated by too much
kicking and a fair smattering of dropped passes and sloppy play.
Most of the first half produced little to entertain, but half backs
Scott Tomlinson and Scott Nichol linked well, however, for Selkirk and
just one minute before the break, Nichol took the ball in midfield and
slipped Kelso fullback Aitchison to score an excellent try.
Selkirk's second try was however a well deserved score, again from
good line-out ball. New Zealand recruit Dean Gage popped the ball up in
the tackle and it was quickly worked to the charging David Hunter who
carved the defence to score at the posts, Pow adding the conversion.
Kelso's attempts finally bore fruit when re-cycled ball worked to
winger Steve Ross who went over for Aitchison to convert. However
Selkirk immediately came back with a great surge earning a penalty, Pow
kicking the goal to send Selkirk clear.
Selkirk -- D Hunter; R Pow, K Johnston, D Gage, D Hulme; S Nichol, S
Tomlinson; I Purves, D Graham, B Johnson, K McConnell (Captain), D
Cameron, S Hamilton, P Minto, D Nichol.
Kelso -- G Aitchison; S Ross, G Laing, R Laing, J Thomson; K Utterson,

Jed-Forest 43, Stewart's-Melville 0
JED-FOREST kept their 100% record and ended that of the visitors with
an overwhelming victory at Riverside Park last night.
The home side scored their first try after almost three hours of
competitive rugby when sterling work by Kevin Armstrong and Ronnie
Kirkpatrick saw the ball moved wide and Chris Richards crossed for the
touchdown in the twelfth minute.
The home side increased their lead midway through the opening period
when winger Steven Turnbull found an opening on the right to secure a
further try.
Slack handling by the visitors allowed winger Mike Yule to capitalise,
scampering over for a further try on the half-hour mark. Fullback
Richards, who had missed both earlier conversion attempts and four
penalties, drew a huge cheer from the home support by sending the ball
between the uprights.
The second period saw Jed's supremacy emphasised as they scored four
further tries.
Donald Scott, who replaced centre Andy Douglas who had retired with an
arm injury, went over five minutes after taking the field, Harry Hogg
adding another three minutes later.
As the match ended its final quarter lock Colin Hynd wriggled over
under the posts and a fine Jed performance was capped in the final
minute when Kevin Amos notched try number seven. Fullback Richards found
his eye at last, kicking three out of four conversions.
Jed-Forest -- C Richards; S Turnbull, H Hogg, A Douglas, M Yule; K
Amos, C Laidlaw; N McIlroy, C Brown, G Kerr, A Dunnet, C Hynd, K

Currie 22, Dundee HS FP 12
AN excellent kicking performance by captain Ally Donaldson, who
contributed 17 points, helped Currie to their third successive victory
in Division Two of the Premier League.
Currie deserved their win as their forwards won the better quality
possession. They put Dundee under tremendous pressure at the scrummages,
although they did not have things all their own way in the lineout,
where Scottish international Stewart Campbell turned in a fine
performance for the visitors.
Currie opened the scoring after five minutes with Donaldson's first
penalty at his second attempt. New Zealander Chris Robinson replied
three minutes later when Currie were caught offside at a ruck, but
Donaldson landed another penalty before they increased their advantage
in 20 minutes.
Ian Russell had come on to replace Bruce Ward while the Currie flanker
had treatment for a head injury, and he picked up at a five-metre
scrummage and drove over the Dundee line for a try.
Donaldson converted and Russell went off again, only to return
permanently when Ward had to depart for good after half an hour.
Robinson brought Dundee back into the game with three penalties before
the interval.
Donaldson added his third penalty in 50 minutes and in the last two
minutes, he made victory certain.
A strong run by Marrack Tonkin into the visitors' twenty-two set up
ideal ball for him to drop a goal, and then, with the last kick of the
game, the stand-off sent a superb penalty between the posts from 40
metres.
Currie -- D Sheppard; C Robertson, M Plumb, M Tonkin, G Keen; A
Donaldson, D Rogerson; P Calder, G Ellis, C Boyd, M Blair, C Eagle, B
Ward, S Hardie, S Logan. Replacement -- I Russell for B Ward (16-21
minutes, then from 30).

Melrose 31, Hawick 3
WHATEVER else emerged of international significance from last night's
Tennents Championship match between Melrose and Hawick at the
Greenyards, the Scotland selectors must have been heartened by the
kicking form of Craig Chalmers.
The Scotland stand-off, taking over the goal-kicking role from Gary
Parker for this third championship match, showed that his practice in
the close season has certainly paid off. His final tally from the boot
was 16 points and for good measure the Melrose stand-off added a try to
hoist his total to an impressive 21.
It was Chalmers' unerring goal-kicking that put Melrose into a 9-3
half-time lead after a 40 minute period in which both sides showed a
lack of adventure, but the former champions upped the tempo dramatically
in the second half.
Their new recruits, Nick Broughton, the open side flanker, and Issac
Feaunati at No.8, made their marks as Melrose hit the right gear. Both
loose forwards pierced holes in the Hawick defence and allowed the other
Melrose forwards to ruck off them.
Broughton capped a fine performance by scoring a wonderful support try
as Melrose turned defence into attack from a spilled pass to Hawick full
back Colin Turnbull. Chalmers collected the loose ball before passing to
Graham Shiel, who in turn slipped the ball to Broughton for the flanker
to cross unopposed.
Melrose struck again when, from a pick-up by Feaunati, the pack rucked
the ball, allowing Bryan Redpath to feed Shiel, who in turn found
Chalmers on his shoulder for the stand-off to race to the line.
Melrose's final try came from Gary Parker, who controlled the ball
well with his feet before winning the touchdown for a score in the
corner.
For Hawick, stand-off Scott Welsh kicked a first half penalty goal.

ROUND-UP
THE big crowd for the third division local derby saw Biggar fritter
away a 13-3 lead against Peebles, and eventually squeeze home by one
point as the visitors' Andre Bell kicked four penalties. Alan Harvey
scored Biggar's try from a forward drive. Dennis Lavery converted it and
kicked two penalties to keep Biggar undefeated, as are Kirkcaldy who
broke their try-scoring famine with four, of which John Mitchell dotted
down two, as they won 35-18 at Corstorphine.
Preston Lodge were never behind in seeing off Musselburgh 26-15.
Torquil Mathewson's try kept Glasgow Accies on target with a 27-3 win at
Grangemouth.
In Division Four, Langholm retained their unbeaten record thanks to a
22-12 success at Wigtownshire. Craig Cottril scored their try which was
converted by Mark Brannan, who added four penalties.
Kilmarnock join them on the top spot by dint of winning the Ayrshire
battle 10-6. They led at half-time 7-0 thanks to a Philip Gordon try
converted by Robbie Stewart, and although Craig Foster kicked two
penalties in the second half for Ayr, one by Gordon kept Kilmarnock
ahead.
Glasgow Southern got their first knock-back, defeated 10-8 at home by
Gordonians, while Haddington took their first points with a 27-17 win at
Edinburgh Wanderers, who are now the only team without a point.

Boroughmuir 25, Gala 10
GALA reacted to a 10-3 half time deficit by creating territorial
ascendancy for the opening 15 minutes of the second half but missed
penalty chances prior to being struck by a blizzard of scoring as
Boroughmuir turned up the taps in a fast moving contest at Meggetland.
Yet Gala's pack seems better equipped all round, two thundering mauls
shunting Boroughmuir backwards for yards. They also scrummage strongly,
the combination of the heavyweights Robert Hogg and Matthias Stoltz
providing a solid core, while there were some typically aggressive
drives by John Amos and Tom Weir but Gala's jumpers found it hard to get
on the same wavelength as their combative reserve hooker and thrower
Jimmy Graham, and although Mark Stumbles is a strong spearhead in Gala's
midfield their backs couldn't quite match the pace on to the ball and
the varied angles of running of Sean Lineen and his cohorts.
David Changleng's penalty goal after Duncan MacCrae had early tackled
Craig Townsend gave Gala the lead in ten minutes but after Stuart Reid
had driven close, and Stark had floated inside, Andy Knight, Steve Wands
and Alastair Cadzow switched left for MacCrae to score and Knight to
convert. Knight missed a drop goal attempt but added a line-out penalty
goal for 10-3 at half time.
It was another Knight penalty goal that inspired some exciting
handling play for tries by Wands, following a Peter Wright thrust, and
by Derek Stark after mesmeric handling and the scoring pass from Lineen.
Knight converted the second.
Yet it was due reward for Gala's persistence and fighting spirit that
they had the last word, a try by Amos after Stoltz had swept off Hogg,
and the conversion by David Changleng.

Stirling Co 17,
Edinburgh Accies 6
CHAMPIONS Stirling County finally broke their duck for the season with
a hard fought 17-6 win over Edinburgh Accies at Bridgehaugh.
A solitary try seven minutes from the end by scrum-half Murray Fraser
clinched the points for Stirling over a stuffy Accies outfit.
But County had the game under control well before that and it was only
some indecision in their backs which prevented them from adding further
scores.
Mark McKenzie opened the scoring for Stirling with a fifth minute
penalty after some Accies obstruction and he made it 6-0 only minutes
later after another indiscretion by the visiting pack.
County scrum half Murray Fraser, improving with every match, almost
caught his opponents out when he darted through their defence at the
base of the scrum but support was slow to arrive and the chance was
lost.
Mark McKenzie then produced some sparkling play, picking up a poor
pass, kicking it inside his opposite number Brian Hay-Smith before being
tackled.
A Hay-Smith penatly reduced the leeway in 29 minutes but County's
forwards still had the upper hand.
Poor Stirling handling in midfield by Matt McGrandles and Mark
McKenzie gifted the ball to Accies No.8 Rob Houle.
His run was stopped, however, and Stirling went straight up the pitch
for a Mark McKenzie drop goal.
McKenzie and Hay-Smith swopped penalties in the early stages of the
second half but in 63 minutes referee Murray stunned the home crowd by
disallowing a McKenzie drop goal after consulting his touch judge.
Instead he awarded Accies a penalty.
The scrum-half, however, made amends in 73 minutes. Concerted Stirling
pressure finally broke the Accies defence and Fraser dived over for a
try. McKenzie missed the conversion.
Stirling County -- C Sangster; S Crawford, I Jardine, M McGrandles, K
Logan; M McKenzie, M Fraser; J Manson, K McKenzie, B Robertson, S
Hamilton, M Norval, G Flockhart, B Ireland, J Brough.
Edinburgh Accies -- K Baillie; B Porter, C Simmers, C Murray, G

Heriot's 0, Watsonians 43
WATSONIANS underlined their position as Premiership pace-setters with
a majestic Goldenacre victory conjured from often meagre rations but in
a manner which suggests that whenever even the most uninviting morsel
comes their way then they will wolf it down with alacrity.
Coach Peter Gallagher spoke nothing less than the truth when he
confided afterwards that for 55 minutes or thereabouts his side had
played ''absolute rubbish'', but for the rest it had been real vintage
stuff. He said: ''For long periods we were on the rack, and if Heriot's
had kicked their goals then it could have been a different story.
Really, there were times when they had us on the rack and we should have
been dead and buried.''
For Heriot's it really was a story of missed opportunities. Kiwi
stand-off Terii Rahui, such a success against Hawick at the weekend,
failed with four penalty goals while team-mate Campbell Aitken was wide
with another. This, allied to the squandered possession, summed up for
them a tale of what might have been.
For Watsonians, though, victory came at a price which may be too high
come Saturday when they entertain Melrose at Myreside. Four ended on the
casualty list. Lock Colin Campbell is the most serious, a sprung
shoulder being suspected. If the diagnosis is confirmed he will be out
for most of the league season. Scott Hastings suffered a bang on the
leg, Jaimie Weston sustained a recurrence of a knee injury, and Stewart
Mather has a rib cartilage problem.
Watsonians were rarely inside the Heriot's half during a rain-soaked
opening period. Nevertheless, they reached the turn 9-0 to the good
thanks to three Duncan Hodge penalty goals.
Once again, the difference was that whenever Watsonians were in a
scoring position it invariably meant points on the board, whereas
Heriot's failed miserably to turn territorial advantage into points.
This is not to devalue the fact that Watsonians, in addition to
everthing else, defended well. They did. But not so well that a better
side than Heriot's could not have manufactured the crucial breach.
In the second period, once the rain had stopped, Watsonians showed an
all-round sharpness with which many a Premiership side will have
difficulty living. Scott Hastings and Andy Garry present a solid and
sharp profile in the midfield allied to willing finishers on both wings.
Hodge kicked Watsonians into the lead after 10 minutes and despite
stern Heriot's pressure it was Hodge again, with another penalty goal 18
minutes later who put the Myreside men further ahead. Six minutes from
half-time Hodge -- on fine form -- made it 9-0 with his third penalty
effort, and Heriot's must have wondered if there was any justice in the
world.
The Myreside stand-off was back in the points with a try and
conversion after 10 minutes of the second half, underscoring the fact
that early promise may now be turning into a blossoming reality.
Andy Garry went over for a try after 58 minutes, converted by Hodge,
and as Watsonians began to get their splendid act together Fergus
Henderson strode in for a fine try which once again Hodge converted.
The stand-off made it 33-0 with another penalty goal and when
Henderson went over for his second try in 76 minutes, Heriot's despair
was almost complete. But not quite.
Neil Burnett romped in for an injury-time try and by this time it
really was a case of rubbing salt into an already open wound.
Heriot's FP -- C Aitken; H Gilmour, G Lawrie, D Stoddart, D Officer; T
Rahui, F McMillan; J Bryce, K Milne, S Paul, C Humphries, P Young, S
Elliott, T McVie, G Dall. Replacement D Fowler for Aitken (65 minutes).
Watsonians -- G Hastings; F Henderson, S Hastings, A Garry, J Kerr; D
Hodge, J Weston; M Stanaway, S Farland, S Mather, C Campbell, M Rudkin,
C Mather, G Hannah, C Brown. Replacements, T Smith for S Mather (40
minutes), M Te Whaiti for S Hastings (68 minutes), N Burnett for Weston
(77 minutes).

EDINBURGH Fund Managers' American Trust lagged behind its US benchmark
index during the first half of this year because it was underweight in
technology stocks which were driving up the market.
Net asset value increased 15% to 317.6p per share, matching a 15% rise
in the Financial Times All Share Index.
But the #265.5m trust underperformed an 18% rise in the Standard and
Poors Composite Index in sterling terms.
Although earnings per share fell to 2.90p from 3.28p, the interim
dividend was unchanged at 1.90p.
American Trust invests 87% of of its funds in US equities, but it also
has small holdings of UK and Latin American shares.
Fund manager Neil Smeaton said US stocks appeared to be fully valued
at present, but he predicted that the Federal Reserve would cut US
interest rates by a further quarter-point during the autumn, giving Wall
Street an additional boost.
''Equities generally should perform quite well against that
background,'' he said.

DEVRO is feeling rather like the contents of its sausage skins -- it
is at the mercy of others as it awaits the outcome of the $290m (#187m)
proposed acquisition of the Teepak International casings manufacturer of
Illinois.
It seems possible that the US Federal Trade Commission will announce
its findings in perhaps a couple of months with a positive verdict
propelling the Moodiesburn-based company into the position as world
leader in the sector.
But there has been some delay in the commission's decision, which is
irritating to chief executive Graeme Alexander. This has coincided with
a fairly flat first half to the year.
The half-time results yesterday indicated there was a slow start in
several areas. There was a surplus of Christmas products left over in
the US, price trading down by manufacturers in Poland who switched from
collagen to cellulose-based skins, and a food poisoning scare in South
Australia which had nothing to do with sausages. There was also slow
trading in the early part of the year throughout the food retailing
industry -- although why sausage consumption should vary remains
something of a puzzle.
There has also been a slower than expected pickup in demand for larger
diameter sausage skins in the US which is a development on which that
Devro has spent about #1m on progressing.
However, there has been spectacular growth in some markets such as
South Korea while overall volumes are improving in almost all markets
apart from Japan.
In the six months to June, overall group sales were 1% lower at #47.2m
due in part to currency factors.
But encouragingly, margins managed to creep ahead to 29.8% at the
operating level which is mouthwatering in the food manufacturing sector.
That was achieved by increased productivity and without raising selling
prices. There has also been the benefit from continual upgrading of the
product to help customers increase their own profitability.
So far, the Teepak deal has cost #1.6m in fees and it seems probable
that these could more than double upon completion.
Full-year profits seem set to improve about #2[1/2]m to around #31.5m
with the real surge to come over the next two years as Devro becomes the
industry global force once it has digested Teepak. That is not expected
to be adverse in either earnings or medium-term gearing.
The half-time dividend is 11% ahead at 2.6p with an 8p total possible
for a 4.2% yield. The shares ended trading yesterday at 239p.

WITH the major players in the bus industry repeatedly stating that
there are plenty of rich pickings left in the UK, yesterday's
announcement by FirstBus of yet another acquisition came as no surprise.
The company, formed by the recent merger of Aberdeen-based GRT and
Weston-super-Mare-based Badgerline, is moving into the Portsmouth area
with an agreed #4.1m bid for The Provincial Bus Company (People's
Provincial).
In spite of divestment rulings by the Department of Trade and Industry
in respect of recent acquisitions by FirstBus's rival, Stagecoach, it
does not expect its latest purchase to run into any problems with the
competition authorities.
Executive chairman Trevor Smallwood highlighted the fact that FirstBus
was not currently represented in the part of the UK in which People's
Provincial operates. Its nearest operations are in Southend, to the
east, and Bath, to the west.
FirstBus plans to boost the People's Provincial operation and expand
its presence in the area through further acquisitions.
Chief executive Moir Lockhead said: ''We have no operations in the
immediate area (of People's Provincial) and that is one of the
attractions -- that we can build up our operations in this area without
any worries about the Office of Fair Trading.
''We think it is an area where we can grow on the back of this
(acquisition). It is a relatively small business but it will do to start
with.''
FirstBus, which with about 5600 buses and 14,500 employees is second
in size only to Perth-based Stagecoach, will fund the purchase of
People's Provincial through the issue of up to 2,896,800 shares at
141.7p. A full cash alternative is available.
People's Provincial, which operates local bus services in and around
Portsmouth, Gosport and Fareham, was created in 1987 by an employee
buy-out from National Bus Company.
It has a fleet of 155 buses and had net assets of #738,000 at December
31, a fraction of what is being paid by FirstBus. In the 12 months to
end-December, it made pre-tax profits of #131,000 on turnover of #6.54m.
Mr Lockhead was pleased with the purchase price, claiming that some
bus companies were currently being valued at a premium to turnover.
He added that net assets of bus companies had historically been very
low.
The board of People's Provincial is unanimously recommending the
acquisition to the company's shareholders.
Mr Smallwood said his company looked forward to improving still
further the fortunes of People's Provincial.
Shares in FirstBus, which currently claims 12.5% of the UK bus market,
were unchanged at 139p yesterday.

* STAGECOACH revealed yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading had
considered referring its recent purchase of a three-bus business in
Sunderland to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The revelation came on the day the Department of Trade and Industry
announced that the acquisition of the goodwill of WH Jolly, completed
for an undisclosed sum in July, would not be referred. This was in line
with the Director General of Fair Trading's ultimate recommendation.
However, John Conroy, managing director of Stagecoach's
Newcastle-based Busways subsidiary, revealed yesterday that he had
received a letter from the mergers secretariat to the OFT, in which it
indicated it might want to refer the bid, even after Stagecoach had
supplied two separate sets of information.
Mr Conroy said: ''I think we were very disappointed that they should
do so (consider a reference), particularly considering the size of the
merger.
''The likely cost of an inquiry, we believe, would have been of the
order of #200,000. We felt this was an unnecessary potential use of
taxpayers' money.''
Touching on Stagecoach's recent run-ins with the competition
authorities, Mr Conroy added: ''We are bringing benefits to the bus
industry and public transport, yet every activity we are engaged in is
under extremely close scrutiny by the Office of Fair Trading and the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the moment.''

WEAK DIY sales in its B&amp;Q business overshadowed a strong recovery
elsewhere in Kingfisher, the retail chain whose other trading formats
include Woolworths, Comet and Superdrug.
Profits in the six months to July 29 dropped by 15% to #74.6m before
tax. This was despite a 6.3% rise in sales in the continuing businesses
to #2272m. The Charlie Brown autocentre business was sold for #19m and
the Titles video rental chain was disposed of in the period in an
attempt to focus on core interests. Excluding B&amp;Q, the retail businesses
were said to have performed as well as or better than the group
expected.
In line with the rest of the economy, there was said to have been a
distinct reduction in consumer confidence and with it demand for DIY
products since April. This coincided with the downturn in the housing
market after a promising start to the year. The hot weather in August is
unlikely to have improved demand.
B&amp;Q's profits dropped 29% to #31.8m although within that the larger
format B&amp;Q Warehouse, which provides a broader product range, traded
ahead of the basic superstore chain. B&amp;Q is experimenting with a High
Street store in Aberdeen selling convenience items for repairs. It is
said to be too early to judge the success of this pilot study. Around
40% of DIY products continue to be bought in the High Street despite
moves by all the major players to large out-of-town sites.
Comet and Woolworths reversed previous like-for-like sales declines
with the aid of better stock control and new product launches.
Woolworths' 7% like-for-like sales growth was said to be particularly
encouraging, with the Chad Valley own-label range of toys doing well. It
almost broke even after making a #6.9m loss previously.
Efforts have been made to reduce the seasonality of Woolworths which
has traditionally relied on pre-Christmas sales for its profitability.
Around 100 exclusive new confectionery products are to be introduced in
the second half. Comet, meanwhile, has begun selling personal computers
in 60 of its stores, which boosted overall sales in these.
Darty, the French electricals business, continued to do well,
out-performing a drab electricals market. Sales and profits at Superdrug
benefited from an increased emphasis on health and beauty.
Despite the disappointing performance from B&amp;Q, Kingfisher's chief
executive, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, said the company was ''on track'' to
meet the objectives set out in its annual report earlier this year.
However, trading conditions are expected to remain difficult.
Kingfisher intends to continue to offer good value to its customers in
the form of competitive prices and better service. In some parts of the
business, such as toys in Woolworths and certain DIY products, this has
led to price cuts.
A third-quarter trading statement is to be made towards the end of the
year. The interim dividend is raised by 2.3% to 4.5p. Kingfisher shares
gained 19p to 483p.

THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday said there should be
no major tax reductions in this year's Budget unless they were financed
by credible cuts in public spending.
In its submissions it called for the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Kenneth Clarke, to introduce a modest package of measures in his
November 28 Budget to support investment and boost employment. It wants
a cautious overall fiscal stance to keep interest rates at a low level.
Kate Barker, CBI director of economic affairs, suggested that the
Chancellor has room for around #3000m of tax cuts without creating
higher inflation or adding to public sector borrowing. However, the
actual recommendations put forward would cost just #1650m.
It also said the Government should take a look at high excise duties
on alcohol and tobacco in the UK. Overall, the CBI is anxious that the
Government sticks to its current borrowing target of 2% of GDP for
1996-97.
In the Budget, the CBI's key priority is maintenance of the present
''credible anti-inflation stance''. With public borrowing a little ahead
of the Government's target in the first months of fiscal year 1995-1996,
and concern over whether the deficit can be kept under control, the CBI
believes there will be little room for short-term policy adjustments in
this year's Budget.
Significant tax reductions for 1996-97 should only be made if they are
accompanied by credible public spending reductions. However, a package
aimed at jobs and investment could be financed by not allocating part of
the contingency reserve to any spending programme.
If the terms were right for personal tax cuts without risking higher
interest rates (either because consumer spending is slowing or because
there are credible public spending cuts), then the CBI would prefer
these were chiefly directed at raising the bottom threshold. This would
remove more people from the tax net and benefit lower paid workers more
than the rest. An alternative would be to reduce employees' National
Insurance contributions.
The CBI described the overall macro-economic situation as favourable,
although there are concerns in some sectors, and said that the hesitant
trend of expansion would be short-lived.
Among the measures it would like to see in the Budget is a reduction
in the smaller firms' rate of corporation tax from 25% to 20%, which
would benefit their retained earnings and cash flow, improvements to the
Enterprise Investment Scheme, with first-year 100% capital allowances on
the first #200,000 annual spend on plant and machinery, and making the
cost of raising equity capital tax deductable.
The Government should also consider allowing a more generous
transition scheme for the Uniform Business Rate, the local tax on firms,
which would enable gainers from the recent revaluation to benefit more
quickly from lower business rates.
The CBI said the Government should improve the present working of
Family Credit by easing the transition to paid work and moving to extend
the scheme to childless couples.
It would also like to see an exemption from capital gains tax based on
the value of proceeds of disposals made each year. Below this disposals
threshold, the individual would not be liable to tax. This would help
eliminate the burden of self-assessment, which is particularly acute in
relation to holdings of shares.
Excise duty rates in the UK relative to other countries within the
single market are a cause of concern to the CBI, which said the
Government must seriously consider whether very large tax differentials
with other EU countries are sustainable.
In particular, legal and illegal imports of alcohol and tobacco are
damaging the competitive position of home-grown producers, distributors
and retailers. The CBI urged the Government to address this and move
towards a more uniform level of duty within the EU.

VISUAL ARTS
* ANY colour, as long as it's black! Ford's famous line could apply to
Scotland's autumn highlight: Fotofeis, from October 5. This nationwide
photography biennial has lined up more than 100 exhibitions from 25
countries from Costa Rica to Portugal with a focus on Canada and
Aberdeen.
It has six themes. One, mortality, is also black: Black Room at
Dundee, Black Butterfly at Aberdeen, Caochladdh on Benbecula, Spirit &amp;
Loss in Glasgow. However, Paisley's Transfigurations features colour
shots by Australian David Stephenson and American Photography 1890-1965
from New York is one multicolour blockbuster with stars like Penn,
Siskind, and Adams.
Another American, Allan Sekula, has taken six years to amass Fish
Story, ports around the world for Tramway. St Enochs features a
collaboration from Montreal while Sauchiehall Street has projections in
shop windows. Fotofeis ends with a conference in Aberdeen.
Both the Royal Glasgow Institute and Scottish Society of Artists have
their annual shows with the enterprising SSA putting its exhibits in the
RSA and on the Internet. The RSA also has the excellent Morrison
Portrait Show from October 21. The RGI will be most welcome at Glasgow's
McLellan Galleries which has had its worst year ever. Closed much of the
time and with one show spreading over 22 weeks, it makes a mockery of
Glasgow City of the Visual Arts. Pollok House also closes for nine
months in November.
Personalities George Wyllie, Nicholas Fairbairn, and Pat Douthwaite
show in Edinburgh in October. At Glasgow's CCA you can see Maud Sulter
in October followed by The Persistence of Painting by seven young Scots
who argue painting still has a role at the end of the millenium. Dalziel
&amp; Scullion's Venice Biennale installation fills December.
Glasgow Print Studio has a tremendous track record for publishing
prints with top artists, which go on sale and show in October.
Stirling's Smith Gallery presents a private collection, which includes
the only Jenny Saville oil in Scotland, from September 29.
Last a new gallery, always heartening. Tod Garner's ceramics gallery
opens in Parnie Street on September 30 joining GPS, Street Level, Art
Exposure, Cranhill Arts and studios like WASPS and framers like Arthire
and Framemaker to make Scotland's Left Bank.

THE benefits of maize planted under polythene, coupled with the hot
summer, have brought a 10-acre field to the harvesting stage a month
earlier than normal in the South-west of Scotland.
Stewartry farmers David and Brian Yates, of East Logan and Firthhead,
planted the maize under polythene in early spring and hope to be able to
re-seed the land and bring in double-cropping. The brothers are part of
the Solway Maize Group which has planted more than 100 acres under
plastic.
The picture shows Brian Yates (left) and one of his workers with the

FARMERS and agricultural research workers face a monumental challenge
if they are to provide international guidelines for ''sustainable''
farming.
Experts from as far apart as New Zealand and Finland are gathered in
Edinburgh for a three-day conference on how to increase crop production
to feed a rising global population using environmentally friendly
technology.
Professor Philip Thomas, head of the Scottish Agricultural College,
told delegates: ''The world population will increase by a factor of two
but the demand for food will increase by a factor of three.
''The increased demand for food will come from developing countries in
Asia, South America and Eastern Europe which will have greater economic
strength.
''It is no longer possible to provide extra food by ploughing up more
acres and applying more fertilisers. We will have to produce extra food
from a farmed land area not much more than already exists.''
He pointed out that forest clearance was not the answer and that
countries such as Japan were demanding the retention of land for
recreation and leisure. He said there was a need for new environmental
technology and, referring to the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT,
that there was a need for a liberalisation of trade in foodstuffs as
well.
Dr Paul Webster of Wye College said there was a challenge from the
community to crop and livestock producers about the protection of slugs,
birds, rare plants and wildlife in general which would demand a cut in
the use of chemicals and lead to a crop yield reduction.
''Any policy to encourage sustainability will not mean more demand for
rural labour requirements or improvements in the rural economy.''
Professor John Marsh of Reading University said the agricultural
industry would be regulated more in the future by non-agricultural
influences such as leisure, recreation and international trading
agreements. ''We have to define what is sustainable and who is prepared
to pay for the produce of that,'' he said.
''Consumers, too, have conflicting interests in sustainability. On the
one hand, they are anxious to to ensure that goods and services are
available at affordable prices and will continue to be available to the
children. On the other hand, they feel threatened by changing
lifestyles, by owners of second homes and commuters.''

YESTERDAY'S sale of Border-Leicester ram lambs in Lanark opened on a
cautious note but towards the end sprung to life with a vengance. Top
price of #6500 was paid for an oustanding lamb from Sally Guild,
Bridgend of Balloch, Kirriemuir, which sold to Tom Howie, Muirside,
Dumfries and John Howie, Hillhouse, Kilmarnock. The sire of this lamb,
Myles Spot On, was purchased last year at Lanark for a modest #650.
Another from this pen sold at #2000 to John Bell, Milton of Philorth,
Fraserburgh, who in turn sold his supreme champion for #2900 to a trio
of Caithness breeders -- Sandy Campbell, Bardnaclavan; Bill Barnetson,
Lynegar, and Harry Gunn, Reiss Lodge.
Shortly afterwards Mrs Guild parted with some of her cash when she
paid Mr Bell #3200 for his final lamb.

PREMIER Oil has achieved a dramatic increase in profits and oil and
gas production following its #102m acquisition of Pict Petroleum in
February.
Output will rise further when new gas fields in Pakistan and the North
Sea come on stream later this year.
Pre-tax profits more than doubled to #14m during the six months to
June 30 from #5.3m in the same period last year. Turnover rose to #36.4m
from #22.1m, with Pict Petroleum's North Sea assets contributing #8.4m.
Oil and gas production soared 42% to a record 19,900 barrels of oil
equivalent per day (boepd), and chief executive Charles Jamieson said
output should reach 30,000 to 32,000 boepd by the end of the year.
The first-half increase was mainly due to higher output from the Wytch
Farm onshore oil field in Dorset, which accounted for two thirds of the
company's total output.
The Fife North Sea oilfield, in which Premier has a 15% stake, entered
production on August 16, boosting the company's output to a current
level of 28,000 boepd.
Production should increase further when gas starts flowing from the
Qadirpur field in Pakistan later this month and from the Galahad North
Sea field in November.
Mr Jamieson said Premier aimed to double its size over the next three
years. The company plans to start gas production in Myanmar (Burma),
expand gas output in Pakistan, start oil production in Albania and carry
out further development in the North Sea.
It is also on the lookout for new acquisitions.
''We will concentrate on building a core business of up to seven
regional assets, each producing a minimum of 5000 boepd to Premier of
sustainable production,'' Mr Jamieson said.
''They are talking of becoming a 60,000 to 70,000 bpd oil company
within three years,'' said an oil analyst with a London stock broker.
Virtually all of Premier's present output comes from the UK, but the
Qadirpur gasfield in Pakistan will give the company an extra 3000 boepd
by the end of this year and double that in the long term.
Mr Jamieson said Premier had two other gas fields in Pakistan which
could be developed to fuel local power stations.
Premier, 25% owned by the US giant Amerada Hess, is also developing
offshore gas fields in Myanmar (Burma) which could produce more than 200
million cubic feet of gas per day.
The company is negotiating a contract to sell this gas to Thailand,
but this means building a pipeline of more than 200km to the Thai
border. Production could not start before 1998.
Closer to home, Premier is experimenting with steam injection to boost
the production of heavy oil in Albania.
''There are about one billion barrels in place and primary recovery is
only giving the Albanians 5%. We would hope to get that up to 10 or
15%,'' Mr Jamieson said.
The company is also exploring for oil in Syria, Tunisia, Cambodia, and
Cuba.
Premier's cash reserves rose to #56.5m during the first half of this
year after Amerada Hess subscribed #19.8m of new shares at the time of
the merger with Pict. This cash injection helped cut gearing to 28% from
50%.
Borrowings stood at #125.7m at the end of June, but part of Premier's
debt is being refinanced with the help of Chemical Bank.
Earnings per share rose 1.17p per share from 0.62p, but there was no
interim dividend. Premier shares rose [1/2]p to 27[3/4]p.
* MOBIL North Sea has announced the start of a $100m programme to
develop its Nevis offshore oil and gas field 185 miles North-east of
Aberdeen.
Nevis is expected to start producing 13,500 bpd of oil and 11 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas in October 1996, but output should
rise further as the field is developed.
The oil and gas from Nevis will be pumped to Mobil's Beryl Alpha
platform four miles away.
Estimated recoverable reserves are 50 million barrels of crude, 1.8
million barrels of condensates and 175 billion cubic feet of natural
gas.

THE Stock Exchange has hit back aggressively against David Jones,
chief executive of Sharelink, following comments he made on BBC Radio
last week.
Mr Jones criticised the Exchange over its refusal to supply share
prices to Electronic Share Information (ESI), which proposed to provide
a share dealing service via the Internet through a joint venture with
Sharelink.
The Exchange said it intended to take disciplinary action against
Sharelink, which is a member firm, on the basis that Mr Jones' comments
constituted ''conduct detrimental to the interests of the Exchange''. It
is also suing him personally for defamation.
The Exchange said it refuted any suggestion that it had abused its
position, denied allegations that it had invalidly varied the terms of
its contract with ESI, and supported, in general terms, innovative use
of the Internet to display and broadcast public information.

BRITAIN'S biggest port owner Associated British Ports kept profits
steaming ahead to #43.5m for the first six months of the year.
''The ports business should continue to benefit from growth in the UK
and world economies,'' said chairman Sir Keith Stuart yesterday as AB
Ports lifted pre-tax profits from #38m in the corresponding period last
year.
Greater cargo volumes at its ports such as Hull, Immingham, Cardiff
and Southampton helped boost group earnings.
In ports and transport, profits rose to #37.4m compared with #35.7m at
the interim stage last year.
The property investment and development side of the business also
scored a better performance with profits of #7.9m against #6.4m a year
ago.
The interim dividend is raised a penny to 3p on 13.4% higher earnings
per share of 8.6p.

TIME was when the popular press in this country took a serious and
informed interest in foreign affairs. Today it is scarcely possible to
imagine a tabloid dedicating a 170-word leader to an event in a
developing country which does not have a domestic news angle. But the
Daily Record did just that in its very first edition in October 1895
when it condemned the invasion of the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar
by the French.
For the Malagasy 1995 marks the centenary of this event, which led to
colony status the following year and to the subsequent abolition of its
monarchy. It is also the 35th anniversary of the country's independence
from French colonial rule. But any celebrations will be muted in view of
the economic plight that continues to afflict Madagascar, the world's
fourth largest island and one of the poorest countries in the world.
International Monetary Fund and World Bank conditions for financial
support have brought about a plummeting currency, and the cost of the
staple food, rice, has doubled in the course of the past year. But so
far there have been few, if any, tangible benefits for the majority of
the island's 12 million inhabitants.
Politically, the situation is somewhat more encouraging. Four years
ago presidential rule by the increasingly totalitarian socialist Didier
Ratsiraka yielded to popular demands for a revised constitution and
fresh elections, and in 1993 an elected National Assembly and coalition
government were set up.
But progress towards solving the country's many problems has been
slow. As a consequence, the current president, Albert Zafy, is seeking
to change the constitution to acquire additional powers, including the
right to nominate the prime minister.
Zafy recently failed to gain parliamentary approval for a vote of no
confidence in the present prime minister, Francisque Ravony, and has
called a referendum for this Sunday, appealing over the heads of
parliamentarians to the general public. The country -- or rather its
political class and the media -- has been obsessed with this single
issue for the past two months and effectively paralysed as a result.
Whatever the outcome, the first visiting foreign politician to be
received by the victor is likely to be Baroness Chalker, Minister for
Overseas Development at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, within the
next fortnight. (The last official visit by a British Foreign Office
Minister was by Malcolm Rifkind, then a Minister of State, a decade
ago).
One event of particular cultural importance during her brief stay will
be the opening of an exhibition of black and white photographs of
Madagascar taken by the missionary William Ellis in the mid-19th
century. These technically superb pictures, first shown earlier this
summer at the Fine Art Society, London, will be on display on the island
for the first time and are likely to create great interest among those
Malagasy eager to rediscover their pre-colonial heritage after years of
''la civilisation francaise'' and the marginalising of their own
indigenous culture and language.
One significant architect -- in both senses -- of that heritage was
the 19th-century Scot, James Cameron, who was responsible for the
external form of the country's most famous building, the Rova or Queen's
Palace, in the capital Antananarivo.
In addition, he oversaw the building of many churches, a reservoir and
an aqueduct, and helped introduce technology to the island in the shape
of its first printing press. The impact of the latter would have been
very different, but for the contribution made by the Welshman David
Jones and other missionaries sent by the London Missionary Society
(itself celebrating its bicentenary this year), since they were
responsible for transcribing the Malagasy language for the first time
using the Roman alphabet.
The churches, both Protestant and Catholic, continue to play a
prominent role in the lives of the majority of the inhabitants in the
field of politics, education and welfare.
But it is for its ecosystem and flora and fauna that Madagascar
attracts interest on a global scale. The vast majority of its plants,
reptiles and mammals and half of its birds are to be found nowhere else.
Several of its lemurs and tortoises, under threat of extinction, are now
protected in national parks and special reserves established in
collaboration with organisations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature.
Tourism, especially of the eco-variety, is growing, though from a low
base. In 1994 the number of international tourists increased by nearly
20% over the previous year to 66,000, of whom just under 5000 were from
the UK. Yet despite these relatively low figures, the industry now ranks
second after coffee in terms of foreign currency earnings.
Anyone curious about the extraordinary ''Grande Ile'' -- two and a
half times the size of Great Britain, with a population originating from
both Indonesia and Africa -- could do worse than check their television
schedules later in the year.
Lee Durrell, widow of Gerald, and a film crew are arriving shortly to
make a programme for Channel 4 on the work of the Jersey Wildlife
Preservation Trust in Madagascar with both lemurs and the world's rarest
tortoise, the Ploughshare. And the rich larder which Madagascar is
capable of producing is soon to be sampled by television cook Keith
Floyd for a forthcoming BBC series. Now that at least should appeal to
some of our tabloids.
* Peter Meech lectures in the Department of Film and Media Studies,
University of Stirling. At the invitation of the ODA he recently visited
Madagascar to hold a series of seminars and workshops with
educationalists and journalists.

Hebron, West Bank
DOZENS of Palestinian children, including babies, were overcome by
teargas when Israeli troops dispersed scuffling Arabs and Jews today in
the West Bank town of Hebron, hospital sources said.
The Gaza-based Palestinian self-rule authority condemned Israel,
saying it was allowing Hebron's Jewish settlers to harass and endanger
the city's Palestinian citizens.
The settlers had tried to tear down a Palestinian flag at a girls'
school and raise an Israeli one. Arab men and women joined in the
fracas, and soldiers used teargas to break it up, witnesses said.
Children at the school and babies at a nearby nursery were overcome by
fumes and taken to hospital. All but one were later released.
It was the third time this week Jewish settlers and Arabs had clashed
at the school in Hebron, a traditional flashpoint of violence and a
sticking point in Israeli-PLO talks to expand Palestinian self-rule.
Israel and Palestinian officials say talks on the second stage of
Palestinian self-rule have been held up by disagreements over security
arrangements in the town, where a few dozen Jewish families live among
100,000 Palestinians.
''Settlers have turned into a militia parallel to the Israeli
occupation army,'' said the Palestinian Ministry of Information. ''And
what is more dangerous is that their practices are protected by the army
and police.
''We hold the Israeli government fully responsible for the lives of
the citizens of Hebron and their property and we call on it to withdraw
its army and the settler groups from the heart of the city to avoid
dangers which result from the presence of settlers and the occupation
army.''
On Sunday, Palestinians said settlers beat the school's headmistress
and threw empty bottles, hurting at least four girls. On Monday, the
army removed the Palestinian flag from the school and warned officials
not to raise it again.
Today, witnesses said settlers spray-painted Stars of David on
neighbouring buildings and strewed rubbish around the site.
Hebron is holy both to Muslims and Jews and radicals from both
religions populate the town, each group loathing the other. In February
1994, a Jewish settler massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers in a mosque.
Meanwhile, police fired water cannon today at hundreds of Israelis
protesting outside Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's residence against the
Israel-PLO peace accord on the second anniversary of the deal.
A call by a militant Israeli group for protesters to block main
intersections across the country went largely unheeded, witnesses said.
''We will do all that it's possible to do, including break the law,''
Moshe Feiglin, a leader of the hardline Zu Artzenu (This Is Our Land),
told Israeli army radio. ''We're ready to pay the price in jail.''
Hamas, the Muslim group behind many of the killings, issued a
statement on the anniversary reaffirming its rejection of the agreement
that set self-rule in motion in Gaza and the West Bank enclave of
Jericho last year. - Reuter.

THE nights might be fair drawing in but take heart dear readers; the
feast in store at Scottish theatres this autumn should fair draw you in
through their doors. You're spoiled for choice so make the most of shows
like the imminent Our Country's Good by Timberlake Wertenbaker. Directed
by Caroline Hall this tense saga of a group of convicts rehearsing the
first play to be performed in Australia opens on Thursday, kicking off a
season at Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum Theatre which features an impressive
ensemble company who will tackle three plays and 100 roles.
The Citizens' ''young guns'' fire into action, refuelling rumbling
rumours of a takeover, with Jon Pope directing Sean O'Casey's Shadow of
a Gunman (October 4-28) and Kenny Miller directing and designing John
Osborne's Look Back in Anger (November 9-December 2). With not an
ironing board in sight.
The fad for adaptations shows no signs of abating at the Dundee Rep
Theatre where, as a tribute to the life and work of Jessie Kesson, Anne
Downie is dramatising The White Bird Passes (September 29-October 4) but
there's plenty of original Scottish drama to be found during the
Tramway's Dark Lights season, such as Boilerhouse's No New Miracles,
(October 6-8) a non-naturalistic work inspired by Georg Buchner's Lenz,
devised by the company with hep writer Alan Warner.
Visiting productions include the Royal National Theatre's
award-festooned productions of J B Priestley's An Inspector Calls
(October 10-14 at the King's in Edinburgh) and Tom Stoppard's
breath-sucking Arcadia, an unmissable treat which opens at Edinburgh's
Festival Theatre on November 7-11 before transferring to the Glasgow
King's.   Other highlights include the Stellar Quines touring with Sue
Glover's The Seal Wife, the Arches Theatre Company's presentation of The
Cabinet of Dr Caligari, a Tron production of Scottish playwright Anthony
Neilson's controversial Penetrator and the blockbusting Phantom of the
Opera at the Playhouse in Edinburgh.
There's no excuses for couch potatoes.

JAZZ fans all over Scotland will have a busy time during the next few
months. Glasgow's Jazz Co-op has organised return visits to the Moir
Hall for Americans tenor star Harry Allen and veteran trombonist George
Masso (October 20), and cornettist Warren Vache (November 28).
Masso will be partnered by trombonist Roy Williams at the Eden Court
in Inverness on October 23, as part of Platform Jazz's winter schedule
which also features American tenor saxophonist Spike Robinson (September
27) and, New York trumpeter Randy Sandke (November 7).
Assembly Direct's winter programme is diverse. Scottish tenor
saxophonist Tommy Smith heads an international line-up at Edinburgh's
Queen's Hall (October 13) and Glasgow's RSAMD (October 14). But it's the
piano which dominates November: American singer-pianist Mose Allison is
at the Queen's Hall on November 24 and Aberdeen's Music Hall on November
25, and France's Labeque sisters play three cities.
The highlights of Dunoon's Jazz Festival (October 13-15) should be
gigs by the American double-act of vibist Terry Gibbs and clarinettist
Buddy DeFranco and the all-star (Spike Robinson, John Barnes and Bobby
Wellins) sax group Tenor Madness.
Edinburgh's Tron Cellar and Glasgow's Basement Jazz in the Ramshorn
Theatre are both running at least one jazz night per week from the end
of September with Scottish bands featured.

JUST when Kingfisher looks to have sorted out one set of problems, up
pops another. The City is getting a little tired of sob stories from the
group.
Six months ago, Woolworths and Comet were the problem but they seem to
be back on track. B&amp;Q is now in the casualty ward. However, its problems
are likely to be of a longer term nature.
Whereas those at Woolies and Comet were due to internal operational
difficulties, B&amp;Q's woes stem from a general malaise in the DIY sector.
Demand is closely linked to activity levels in the housing market. And
poor results from housebuilders and weak mortgage lending illustrate the
depressed state of that market.
In the absence of any help from the Government there is unlikely to be
a major upturn in the housing market and with it consumer confidence.
B&amp;Q, which has at least consolidated its market leadership, can only
hope that homeowners who have decided to stay put will opt to refurbish
their existing property, but given the length of the housing market
recession this must have already occurred in many cases.
Despite having a string of well known High Street brands, Kingfisher
continues to provide an inadequate return on its assets. It came later
than others to the use of electronic systems which means that it is only
now getting to grips in a major way with product innovation and stock
control. Maybe it is time the group was broken up and sold off.
There is still no news on the appointment of a new chairman, which
probably demonstrates just what a poisoned chalice it has become.

SPRING Into Fall . . . . Fall Into Step. Pun it how you will, one
thing is clear, this autumn season is simply packed with quality dance
from home and abroad.
NDT2 -- the massively talented youth wing of Nederlands Dans Theater
-- puts in a welcome appearance at the MacRobert Arts Centre in Stirling
(October 27-28). Quite a coup for the MacBob -- this is the only
Scottish venue on the current company tour. Add in performances by
Motionhouse, V-TOL, and the highly physical dynamO Theatre (from Canada)
and the good news is that the centre is again programming dance in an
energetic, imaginative vein.
Edinburgh's Festival Theatre, meanwhile, burnishes its reputation as a
hot-bed of excellence and versatility with a clutch of autumn goodies
that span every aspect of dance performance from the headlong
physicality of DV8 (in Lloyd Newson's latest work, Enter Achilles) to
the marvellously measured invention of Siobhan Davies and beyond -- to
the dashing, flashing, skating extravaganza Hot Ice.
To cap all this, the Festival Theatre has stolen an astute march on
longer-established venues the length and breadth of the country. It has
secured the only British performances by the New York Paul Taylor Dance
Company celebrating its 40th anniversary. And where is Glasgow in all
this? Hosting its first visit by the relaunched Rambert Dance Company at
the end of September and nurturing young, local talent -- such as Group
N and Dudendance -- at the Tramway as part of the Dark Lights season. Oh
-- as if we hadn't told you often enough by now -- Tap Dogs are at the
Theatre Royal in October. Yes indeedy, autumn has the stamp of amazing
dance on it -- start booking now.

WITH a tidal wave of programmes, Scotland's winter season of classical
music opens at the beginning of October. And the highlights start
immediately with a glittering week of concerts promoted by the Glasgow
Royal Concert Hall to celebrate its fifth birthday. With three concerts
by the St Petersburg Phil and Yuri Temirkanov, one by the Royal SNO with
Alexander Lazarev and singers from the Bolshoi, and the coup de grace
delivered the ultimate diva, Montserrat Caballe, the first week in
October promises to be breathtaking.
The Royal SNO launch their own winter season with an explosive
concert, with principal guest conductor Lazarev. The steel core to the
RSNO's winter season is provided by Lazarev in his survey of the wartime
symphonies of Shostakovich, numbers seven, eight, and nine.
Over at the Scottish Chamber Orchestra there are two unmissable
events. The first is the return of the sensational Joseph Swensen. Like
many soloists before him, Swensen, a violinist, relinquished his
instrument for the conductor's baton. But this one is the real McCoy --
he produced an electrifying Eroica Symphony with the SCO. This year
(November dates, only in St Andrews, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) he tackles
James MacMillan's first major orchestral work, Tryst, and Strauss's
Metamorphosen.
The Royal SNO and SCO will play together in a two-week festival of
American music, to be staged in Glasgow in February under the musical
direction of Andrew Litton.
Finally, watch out for visits to Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall from the
Royal Philharmonic and Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestras, part of
the first Royal Orchestral Exchange, and a little extra spice to the
season.

SCOTTISH music industry insiders hope that this autumn's biggest
Glasgow-based event, the 10-Day Weekend, scheduled to take place
city-wide from Friday, October 13, until Sunday, October 22, will
counter what they have identified as a major threat to the future of
live performance.
They fear that a whole generation of younger music-lovers are failing
to acquire the habit of going to see live bands and the 10-Day Weekend
thus features a number of notables.
Prominent among the headliners will be Jimmy Somerville, the Boo
Radleys, Underworld, Sleeper, and D:Ream, with the Bathers in a special
five-night Tramway residency.
Aberdeen's annual Alternative Festival, from October 12-21, features
the Michael Nyman Band, Capercaillie, and Nanci Griffith, the latter
also playing at Edinburgh's Usher Hall.
Veterans Art Garfunkel and Joan Baez make rare Scottish appearances,
in Glasgow, while the Everly Brothers add a show in Dundee to others in
Glasgow and Edinburgh. Head Kink Ray Davies brings his Unplugged-style
Edinburgh Fringe show to Glasgow's Pavilion. Nearer to Christmas, Status
Quo and Gary Glitter perform at the SECC.
Contemporary British pop's standard-bearers, Pulp and Blur, sample
Glasgow in the fall, along with recent T In The Park hits Black Grape,
the Charlatans, M People, the Beautiful South, and Paul Weller, plus new
mainstream favourites Celine Dion and the Human League. The Stone Roses
return, seeking to raise Barrowland's roof.
Scottish hero Edwyn Collins returns, too, as do Wet Wet Wet. Again.
And again. Yon Wets have already sold out three of their four shows at
the SECC in November and December. If you can't see them, you've plenty
more to choose from.

CAUTION is the byword of the CBI'S relatively mild submissions to the
Chancellor on his autumn Budget.
The employers' body still believes that what appears to be the
hesitant trend in growth in the economy this year will not last. But it
does not want the Chancellor to take any risks by, for example, going
for the popularity vote through tax reductions. It seems highly
improbable, given the inflationary risk, that he would do this.
There was no mention yesterday of any specific move to help the
housing market, which some in the industry have been urging given the
continuing poor state of the construction industry, though the CBI
recognises that its hopes for next year could still come unstuck.
The CBI primarily concentrated on proposals that would help small
businesses.
In general terms, it clearly believes that the Chancellor should only
tinker with the economy when he brings down the November 28 Budget
though the suggestion that excise duty on alcohol should be lowered
should be welcomed given the present situation in which cheap drink is
being brought into the country from the Continent.
But while the CBI described the general economic background as broadly
favourable, it recognised that there remain concerns in particular
sectors, such as contruction. There is also a considerable risk that
consumer confidence, rather than growing next year as the CBI expects,
could worsen as a result of the slower rate of reduction in
unemployment. If consumer confidence is lacking, there is not much hope
for a recovery in the housing market.
If consumer spending is weak in 1996, it could keep GDP growth down
towards its historic long-term trend rate of 2.3%. This would be
regarded as an unwelcome development, and the CBI would not yet consider
the economy has recovered back to its long-term sustainable growth path.
But in the meantime, the message to the Chancellor is do nothing too
dramatic at this delicate stage.

TELEVISION
IN a particularly strong season for television drama, there are two
series which are, quite simply, unmissable. The first is Jimmy
McGovern's Cracker, starring Robbie Coltrane, which takes up where the
last blistering series left off -- with Jane Penhaligon (Geraldine
Somerville) pulling a gun on her cop colleague Jimmy Beck (Lorcan
Cranitch) who she believes to have raped her. Meanwhile, Fitz is called
in to assist in the investigation of a prostitute's brutal murder. Sad
to say that this is the last series of Granada's superlative drama.
The second series which you miss at your peril is The Final Cut, the
eagerly-awaited adaptation (by Andrew Davies) of the last part of
Michael Dobb's House of Cards trilogy. The scheming Prime Minister
Urquhart (Ian Richardson) is approaching the end of his reign and he's
determined to go out with a bang. But his murky past comes back to haunt
him.
Elsewhere in the drama stakes there is something of a sense of deja
view. The Beeb returns with Dangerfield, Casualty, Bugs, and Roughnecks
while ITV brings back Soldier Soldier, Class Act, London's Burning, and
Heartbeat.
However, there are some promising signs of an attempt by both sides to
find something new. ITV launches pilots for no fewer than four new
dramas -- Bliss (a medical science thriller starring Simon Shepherd);
Strike Force (which plans to do for the RAF what Soldier Soldier did for
the Army); Paparazzo (in which Nick Berry stars as a star-chasing
photographer); and McCallum (a thriller from our own STV starring John
Hannah as a forensic pathologist).
Meanwhile, the BBC wisely does what it does best with a sumptuous
six-part adaptation (by Andrew Davies, again) of Jane Austen's Pride and
Prejudice starring Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle, and Alison Steadman.
The highlight factual series of the season is sure to be ITV's
six-part documentary, The Beatles, in which McCartney, Harrison, and
Starr tell the story in their own words, from the formation of the
Quarrymen to the break-up after Let It Be. In addition to
newly-discovered footage of the group, there is also the unique chance
to hear two previously unheard Beatles songs, Free as a Bird and Real
Love, which Lennon wrote and recorded when the group was still together.
The three survivors bring additional instrumentation, voices, and
arrangements to the tracks.

THE fall in last month's jobless total and also in annual earnings
growth to 3.25%, compared to market expectations of 3.5%, had a positive
impact on interest rate sentiment in the City where the FTSE-100 index
reached a record closing high of 3570.8, up 34.9, boosted also by a good
start for Wall Street.
The unemployment figures lessened worries about the slowing economy,
helped by the slight downward revision for July which had previously
showed an increase, while earnings provided further evidence that
inflationary pressures are continuing to ease.
Official UK inflation and retail sales figures for August are due out
today, but most recent economic data encourages the belief that interest
rates may well have peaked even if they are not yet in line for a
reduction.
Definite evidence that the economic recovery is faltering will be
needed before Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is likely to take that risk. And
while the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, appears to have
been persuaded by that an increase in base rates is not needed -- at
least for the time being -- it is unlikely that he will have done a
complete volte face and be supporting an actual reduction. Increasingly
it looks like a no-change situation.
The good news on earnings growth was to some extent offset by a
further marked acceleration in manufacturing unit labour costs growth,
but in general analysts consider the figures are probably about neutral
in terms of the outlook for both the economy and monetary policy.

THERE'S a man in the Vatican who knows all there is to know about
women's rights. What he actually knows about women, given an enforced
abstinence from anything other than strictly social contact with those
exotic beings, is quite another matter. But when it comes to their
rights, such as they are, His Holiness the Pope knows almost as much as
any Iranian ayatollah.
Or so we must assume. Celibate males lacking a hot line to the
Almighty generally have little to say about sexual relations or family
life, for the sane and sensible reason that they are liable to know very
little worth knowing about either, but His Holiness, conspicuously, has
no such inhibitions. He may have no practical experience but he does
have the manual. When the spiritual welfare of humankind is at stake,
you don't mess around with details.
So it was that a strike force from the Vatican, together with the
people who brought you Salman Rushdie's fatwa, twisted a sufficient
number of arms at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing
this week to ensure that the phrase ''sexual rights'' did not appear in
the event's final declaration. Two groups not hitherto noted for a deep
interest in anyone's rights combined -- the ecumenical spirit is a
mighty thing -- to make certain the girlies didn't get out of hand.
This was, as some of you might have noticed, somewhat reminiscent of
the coups attempted by the fundamentalists when the UN last discussed
population. At that conference, too, the arguments for and against
population control were reduced to slogans derived from several
contradictory ancient texts whose provenance, never mind usefulness, are
far from being universally accepted. The needs of the spirit were put
some way ahead of the needs of the species and, as in Beijing, a man
forbidden to procreate sought to tell the rest of us what we should, and
should not, get up to.
This week the holy men were worried about the family. The religious of
whatever faith generally are, since their control of reproduction, and
of women, largely depends on their ability to maintain the nuclear
heterosexual unit. The phrase ''sexual rights'', as sponsored by the
European Union, was thus held to imply that ''immoral'' family units --
lone parents, same-sex parents, and so forth -- might conceivably be
legitimate. Motherhood would somehow be belittled -- by whom? you wanted
to ask -- and religious faith undermined.
For this observer's money, such as it is, few things seem better
guaranteed to undermine faith than the pontiff and his like
pontificating about sexuality. It is not just that they make their
chaste selves look ridiculous -- it would take a real miracle for them
to look anything else -- but their counsel is so utterly at odds with
what ordinary people know of life as to be downright dangerous.
Sexuality does come in many varieties, marriages do break down, lone
parents are as good or as bad as any other sort, and contraception, as
so many good Catholics have learned, does make perfect sense. To demand
otherwise just because the Book says so is akin to lecturing the tide
for coming in -- and almost as pointless. It might even get you laughed
at.
What was striking about events in Beijing, as with some many social
issues, was the way in which religious sects who would otherwise happily
anathematise one another until kingdom come could make common cause.
Divided by doctrine -- your saviour or mine; their worship or ours --
they are united in their fundamentalism and in the bizarre logic that
says to a secular world, ''You refuse to tolerate my intolerance. Ergo,
your intolerance is equal to mine. Ergo, your objections count for
nothing. QE, you sinner, D''.
Thus it is that none among them is keen on queers, save as useful
monsters to be denounced, dehumanised, and, if the spirit is really
moving and shaking, ''cured''. Be they Catholics, Muslims, Southern
Baptists, or obscurantist Presbyterians of limited probity, their
eagerness to pillory homosexuals makes for a fascinating study in
cruelty, even when, as with the Catholic Church and certain others,
their institutional experience of homosexual practice is second to none.
Equally, the fundamentalists -- and why have they all become so chary
of that word all of a sudden? -- are foes of abortion, and often
opponents of contraception. They appear, indeed, to have some
deep-seated psychological problem with women in general, demanding that
they go veiled, keep themselves ''pure'' for but one careful owner, are
not allowed too many opportunities to escape from the misery of bad
marriages, and remain at all times available to reproduce, like it or
not. Small wonder there is endless fretting over sexual education.
AT the bottom of all this, it seems to me, there is a real impatience
with the very idea of rights. Iran's clerics recognise no such concept
where Rushdie is concerned, for example. Yet the most striking thing
about the early days of the fatwa was the way in which leaders of all
faiths, from Canterbury to the Chief Rabbi, went out of their way to
sympathise with Iran rather than its intended victim. Freedom of speech
was all very well, it appeared, just so long as religions remained free
to persecute anyone who wished to exercise it.
So with women. So with gays. So, despite all the bunkum about love and
charity, any human being whose life and feelings fail to fit the
demented blueprint. In Beijing this week they were arguing the toss over
whether parents should even teach their children about sex. If those who
sired our men of God had taken the trouble the world would be a
healthier, happier place and half the species would not, at this late
date, still be demanding equality.

THE stock market was relieved by the first-half results from
Prudential which showed profits ahead despite the depressed UK life
insurance sector, and the shares climbed 17p to 353[1/2]p.
Profits were ahead from #280m to #304m before exceptionals for the six
months to June largely on the back of an improved performance in the US
following management action. The interim dividend is raised by 8% to
12.6p.
The contribution from UK life and pensions business slipped a little
to #130m, but the group is hopeful the market will start to pick up
towards the end of the year and into 1996. Chief executive Peter Davis
accepts that it has made mistakes. ''We must listen more closely to the
needs of our customers and change in order to meet those needs,'' he
said.
Mr Davis has a marketing background and his brief is to improve
Prudential's products. They are likely to become more straightforward
and flexible.
New annual premiums in pensions business were flat in the first half
and for investment products they plummeted 72%. Single premiums were
also well down. The fall reflected damaged consumer confidence in the
industry and longer processing time necessary for sales in the new
regulatory regime. However, the group said it raised market share,
improved service levels and reduced costs.
Mr Davis said it was working with the Securities and Investments Board
and other regulators to rebuild consumer confidence in the industry.
This contrasts with the combative attitude to the regulators adopted by
his predecessor, Mick Newmarch.
In general insurance, UK underwriting profits were maintained, with
lower claims frequency offsetting softer premium rates. The reinsurance
arm fell back #14m into the red owing to provisions against possible
defaults by other reinsurers.

A PROVEN partnership between the public and private sector swings into
action this weekend, when five Strathclyde University business and
language graduates leave for Paris to head a new, international
initiative aimed at furthering the growth of Scottish companies, writes
PAUL WELSH.
As the first participants in Global Graduates, a scheme designed by
Glasgow-based consultancy Euroventure and running in partnership with
Dunbartonshire Enterprise, they hope to emulate the success of the
programme's forerunner in Northern Ireland.
Since Euroventure established a prototype Explorers scheme there four
years ago, more than 200 local graduates have taken up business
placements in the rest of Europe, Asia and the US.
Last year alone, 60 of them went on to generate #3.5m worth of new
business for participating companies who estimate a further #21.5m in
sales this year, as a direct result of their activities.

Minsk
THE former Soviet republic of Belarus admitted today that its air
defences had shot down a hot air balloon, killing its two American
pilots.
A government statement said the balloon was shot down yesterday two
hours after it was observed crossing the border from Poland and all
attempts to communicate with it had failed.
It referred to the two victims only as foreign nationals, but the US
embassy in Minsk said it had been told they were Americans. The craft
appeared to have been taking part in an international competition, whose
organisers said they had permission to enter Belarussian airspace.
''All measures by air defence forces to establish contact with the
flying object failed,'' the statement said.
''These included use of additional radio equipment, repeated attempts
to establish contact, flights around the craft to establish visual
contact with the pilots and warning shots.''
It did not indicate how the craft was downed but said the action
occurred near a military airbase where strategic forces are deployed.
The government expressed regret at the loss of life and an order
issued by President Alexander Lukashenko said criminal proceedings had
been launched in connection with the incident.
A US embassy spokeswoman in Minsk said the two dead Americans had been
identified and a consular official was on his way to the town of
Beryoza, near the Polish border, to collect them.
She added that the craft had been taking part in the Gordon Bennett
ballooning race which opened in eastern Switzerland last Saturday. Other
balloons were known to be in the area.
Organisers in Switzerland said the aim of the race was to fly as far
as possible with one load of fuel, with direction determined by
prevailing winds and no fixed destination. Fifteen craft, including four
US crews, had started.
A spokesman for the Swiss Aeroclub contacted from Zurich said he was
surprised at suggestions that the pilots had failed to identify
themselves as the crews were required to have radios for contact with
air traffic controllers.
''They stay in touch and get passed along from one air control centre
to the other just like aeroplanes,'' he said.
He said organisers had secured permission to cross into Belarussian
airspace. The balloons were easy to recognise on radar owing to their
size and slow movement.
Intrusions into airspace frequently generated controversy in the
Soviet era.
The US State Department today branded
''unacceptable'' a 24-hour delay by Belarus
in notifiying Washington over the shot down
ballon.
'' We have called upon the Belarussian
authorities, and do so again right now, to
co-operate fully with our embassay in Minsk
to ensure full consular access for American
diplomats. We also called upon them to conduct
a full and thorough investigation,''
department spokesman NIcholas Burns said.- Reuter

BOOKS
* PLACE your Booker bets here. The smart money is already on Pat
Barker's The Ghost Road, upcoming from Viking. But it is only one
highlight of an autumn with something for everyone. Umberto Eco's
mysteriously entitled The Island of the Day Before (Secker) is also
eagerly awaited, but then so is our own Jeff Torrington's follow up to
Swing Hammer Swing, The Devil's Carousel, from the same publisher. Much
discussed is Nicholas Evans's The Horse Whisperer, expensively bought by
Robert Redford before it was even complete.
Equally intriguing is Elaine Feinstein's Lady Chatterley's Confessions
(Macmillan) -- a sequel to the most controversial British novel of the
century.
The non-fiction surprise of the autumn is Priscilla Roosevelt's Life
on the Russian Country Estate, published by Yale University Press at the
end of next month.
Of biographies, one of the pick of the bunch will be Ian McIntyre's
study of Burns, due in November from HarperCollins. Also keenly
anticipated are John Rentoul's Tony Blair (Little, Brown), which
reportedly throws interesting light on the Labour leader's time at
Fettes College, Edinburgh, and Leonard Nimoy's I Am Spock (Century) will
also have many fans.
Of European literature Czech writer Ivan Klima's Waiting For The Dark,
Waiting For The Light (Granta) will be a fashionable tome to leave on
the brasserie table, as will the final novel of Albert Camus. The
world's smartest goalkeeper was completing The First Man when he died in
1960 and when it was published recently in France it sold some 300,000
copies in hardback. The English edition will be published by Hamish
Hamilton.

PARTNERSHIP seems to be the buzz word, with politicians and
businessmen at both national and local level all keen to enter into
various alliances with particular groups. This week's bid by the Glasgow
Chamber of Commerce to host the 1998 annual conference of the British
Chambers of Commerce is one such partnership, involving as it does other
Scottish chambers, the Glasgow Development Agency, and Greater Glasgow
Tourist Board among others.
One attempt by the Government to foster a high-profile public/private
partnership is through its Private Finance Initiative, PFI. This would
allow infrastructure projects to go ahead earlier than would otherwise
have been possible because of lack of public funds. This programme is
likely to become even more relevant as Government departmental spending
budgets are cut to make funds available for pre-election tax cuts.
Many potential PFI projects are vital if the UK is to remain
competitive in the global market-place. While good in principle, the PFI
programme seems to have stalled, with potential private-sector partners,
particularly in the rail and health sector, put off by the many layers
of red tape which have to be negotiated before action can take place.
Maybe it would have been better for the Government to focus on a small
number of PFI projects which would have thrown up any problems at an
early stage, thereby enabling a streamlining of the process to take
place. There are some who believe that the PFI has been held up by
misplaced concerns. Jeremy Peat, chief economist of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, thinks PFI is being held back by unrealistic attempts to make
comparisons between the efficiency of public and private sector funding.
Peat says that in any comparison of private versus public funding the
public cost would tend to be underestimated, while the private sector
would be reluctant to reveal the full extent of efficiency savings which
it hoped to make. Peat is a former economic adviser to the Scottish
Office and to the Treasury and so is well placed to judge these matters.
Whatever the reasons for the delay, the hold-up is a particular shame
for the construction industry which was relying on work associated with
the PFI to fill the gap in demand caused by the lingering effects of
recession in the property market in general and housing sector in
particular. Although the general economy is expected to grow by 2% this
year, the housebuilding industry has witnessed a 20% decline.
Some examples of PFI that have taken place -- such as the #23.5m Skye
bridge, one of the Scottish Office's flagship projects -- have not been
popular with consumers because of the accompanying higher charges.
Private sector organisations invariably demand a quicker pay-back on
their investment than the public sector.
A similar situation is occurring in the private healthcare sector,
with some elderly people having to sell their properties to pay the high
costs, averaging around #300 per week, for a place in a residential
nursing home. Such homes provide an essential, valuable service against
a background of the rundown in the state sector, which although funded
through our taxes was free at the point of delivery.
In the future, private insurance policies to help cover the cost of
long-term care are likely to become necessary to top up the help
provided by the state. Often the private sector needs a nudge from
government to identify how best to meet a particular need in the
market-place. We have seen this with the emergence of both mortgage
protection and long-term care insurance policies.
However, for all the teething problems that would inevitably have
occurred, a public/private partnership approach should have been the
path taken when the decision was made to privatise the water and
regional electricity companies in England and Wales. That way the best
elements of operating in both sectors could have been harnessed, the
superior financial management and entrepreneurial skills of the private
sector married with the accountability and social responsibility of the
public sector.
Such an approach would be suitable for the forthcoming privatisations
of the National Grid and Nuclear Electric.
As it is, the privatised utilities, while generating large profits and
dividends for the directors and shareholders, have lost the trust of a
large section of the British people. This has been particularly
noticeable lately in the case of Yorkshire Water which has struggled to
maintain water supplies to its customers during the drought.

IN late stock market trading yesterday attention centred on United
Biscuits after it was disclosed that Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management,
part of the Swiss financial group UBS, had acquired a 10.2% stake in the
troubled food manufacturer.
Results published today are expected to show a cut in the interim
dividend from 5p to 3.5p a share. Profits are anticipated to fall from
#80.1m to around #30m.
Investors will be keen to learn about progress on the disposal of its
troubled US snacks business, Keebler. Pepsico, Kelloggs and Campbells
have all been mentioned as potential buyers. However, Keebler is not
thought to be the only problem area. The UK biscuit market is mature and
becoming increasingly competitive.

GOVERNMENT restrictions on the political activities of local authority
workers are to be challenged in the European Court of Human Rights.
A case brought by four local government officers claims that
regulations introduced in 1990 are a breach of their freedom of speech
and their right to stand in elections -- both safeguarded by the
European Convention on Human Rights, to which Britain is a signatory.
The four -- Mr Ray Bentley, Mr Dennis Perrin, Mr Mobin Ahmed, and Mr
David Brough -- were all active in political life before the rules came
into force. Their appeal against the restrictions was dismissed by the
Court of Appeal in 1992, and leave to appeal to the House of Lords was
refused in 1993.
Now the European Commission on Human Rights has declared their case
admissible to the human rights court after a one-day private hearing in
Strasbourg.
The Local Government Officers (Political Restrictions) Regulations
1990 set out five terms of office for certain grades of local government
staff:
* No active office in political parties;
* No canvassing on behalf of political parties;
* No standing for election either to a local authority, the House of
Commons, or the European Parliament;
* No public speaking in support of a political party;
* No written publications promoting a political party.
The Government insists that the rules are to protect the tradition of
political impartiality in local authority service, amid growing concern
about increased party politicisation. The regulations are said to be
performing a ''vital'' function in preserving political independence and
avoiding the risk of conflicting loyalties in the service of elected
local representatives.
Government lawyers told the commission that the number of local
government officers affected was limited to about 40,000, depending on
their salaries and exact functions. In addition, an adjudicator could
exempt a member of staff from the regulations, regardless of salary, if
it was felt there was no conflict of interest.
However, the four workers say that the regulations breach specific
articles in the human rights convention by interfering with their
freedom of expression and by denying them the basic right to stand in
elections.
They also emphasised that there had never been any criticism of the
way they carried out their professional duties before the regulations
came into force, despite their political involvement.
A separate challenge by their union, Unison, was declared
inadmissible, despite the union's claim that it is seriously affected
because a significant proportion of its members are prevented from
playing an active role in political life.

David Grant feels the vibe with acid-jazz, soul-funksters from
Elemental -- concocting a strange chemistry for success.
DRUMMER David Mitchell says of his band Elemental: ''We're hard to
pigeonhole.'' However you choose to classify their sound, the attentive
eyes and ears of major record companies are passing judgment on this
five-piece from the Stirling area.
Certainly nothing as mundane as mainstream pop emanates from this
quintet; more a studied leaning to acid-jazz, complete with passing nods
to soul and funk. ''A marketing nightmare,'' supposes David.
''We were always compared to the Brand New Heavies, and while we try
to shy away from that likeness, we saw them recently at Barrowland, and
felt there was nothing there that we weren't capable of.''
Evolving from the Sade-cum-Deacon Blue-style dissatisfaction that was
originally Angel Train, drummer Mitchell, guitarist Colin Dixon, bassist
Alan Smith and velvet-voiced Kathleen Fairgrieve enlisted keyboards
player Michael Stein and began to move in a different -- and more
satisfying -- direction.
''Music in the vein of Jamiroquai, Sly Stone and Stevie Wonder is
making a resurgence at present,'' maintains Stein, who to these ears has
also introduced a modicum of James Taylor Quartet-influenced sound into
the band, which has had to fight its way out of a somewhat
one-dimensional music area.
''The Stirling and Hillfoots area is swamped with heavy rock bands and
Nirvana clones. A lot of venues haven't known what to make of us, but
they usually stop and listen,'' adds Michael.
Another who has stopped and listened is Davy Paterson, whose Opus One
studios in Tullibody has spawned a new three-track EP by the band.
Paterson's faith in the group has led to his offering to promote the
band for the next six months.
The first fruits of this collaboration -- the tracks Carpet Dreams,
Just A Ride and Friends Of Mind -- will be among many being showcased at
Stirling University's MacRobert Arts Centre today, bringing hopes that
record company interest may blossom into a contract.
''We've always essentially been a live-performance band, and have been
trying to recreate that with Davy in the studio,'' says Mitchell.
The band already has around 20 original tracks in its repertoire, and
has steadfastly ditched covers from live performances -- even a rather
entertaining Jimi Hendrix tribute that had jokingly made an appearance
at one gig.
Elemental's new EP follows hot on the heels of the first release,
Bending Reality EP, in February and attracted local press and media
interest. A new band ranking show on Central FM saw Elemental rated as
top tip, while a #500 grant from Clackmannan Arts Council was a welcome
financial boost at a time when the band was trying to establish itself.
It is Fairgrieve who provides 70% of the band's lyrics, although all
the members of Elemental are involved in the songwriting process. But
the four guys are certainly not merely a backing band for Fairgrieve's
vocal talents. ''She's always pushed the band aspect -- we're very much
a group. She's pretty down to earth, she must be -- she supports Raith
Rovers!'' admits Mitchell.
The band members have certainly had their eye on stardom, even
creating (or perhaps inventing would be a better term) their own
publishing company -- MadCat Music -- when promoting that first EP. ''We
felt it looked better with an official title rather than just punting a
tape around record companies,'' admitted Stein.
There will be an appearance at the Cruise Aid benefit concert in
Edinburgh during October. ''Then we have to try to get some support gigs
for some big names and get ourselves noticed,'' said Mitchell.
With the musicianship on display within the ranks of Elemental, that
shouldn't be too difficult.
Elemental play the MacRobert Arts Centre, Stirling tonight at 10.30.

IT WAS unfair of the BBC not to issue a warning before its
transmission of the TUC conference. Something about ''those with a
nervous disposition finding scenes which they might find disturbing and
offensive'' would have done. For, make no mistake, this was a brutal
tale of lust, passion, cruelty, and heartlessness.
About an adopted son -- ''I was not born into the Labour Party -- I
chose it'' -- who turns on his ageing parents, now frail, powerless, and
confused, and abandons them. Not for them the promise of a ''granny''
flat (with an accompanying meals-on-wheels service of beer and
sandwiches) in the brand-new home he hopes to move into in 18 months'
time but a casting off into the wilderness, with the only sign of
compassion a callous offer of a course of ''therapy''. (Pirate videos
will shortly be on sale at the Barras entitled I Spit On Your Grave 2.)
But can we really blame young Tony? Is he not the product of his
environment and the shocking exposure to the violence and horror on
television? Just think about it. From 1979 until 1990 -- 11 of his most
formative years -- he has been subjected to flashing images on
television of a woman known only as ''The Baroness''. This mysterious
figure who once operated under the unassuming name of Mrs Thatcher came
from nowhere and, armed only with a handbag, bestrode the globe sinking
battleships in the South Atlantic, assaulting cowering socialists in
Brussels, and duffing up miners in Yorkshire.
It is not surprising then that Tony still fantasises about her. On
holiday Down Under to see his buddy Rupert Murdoch he can talk of little
else. In fact he finds there is an antipodean mania about her. Even his
old chum Bryan Gould, exiled in New Zealand, writes a book and admits to
having a ''sneaking admiration'' for the Baroness. Back home he receives
memos from party pals telling him he does not have ''a politial project
that matches the Thatcher agenda''. There is that name again!
Now Tony is a bright boy, after all he had a proper education -- his
parents paid for it -- unlike the rest in the party who went to
comprehensives. And he knows the value of it, which is why, before work
each day, he is quite willing to drive his son miles across London past
dozens of local authority schools where other children go, to an opt-out
school which helps make you think.
For he has been thinking of none other than the Baroness; could it be
that he could do what she did? ''I was not born to the Baroness -- I
became her.'' Able to read -- unlike the 25% of school-leaving
16-year-olds who did not go to Fettes and therefore can't -- he was able
to wallow in the striking similarities between himself and his heroine.
When the Baroness became leader of the Tory party in the late
seventies she too sought change and had few committed allies. What did
she do? Why, she disposed of the old guard, the cossetted mandarins, the
aged landowners, the bloated bourgeoisie, and dispatched them, like King
Lear, to the blasted heath.
Tony, being a moderniser, did not want to go back to 1605 -- the first
year of the union block vote -- for his method of purging. Blackadder
was a much better example, with the TUC as Baldrick and its ''cunning
plan'' for a minimum wage deported to the no-man's-land of committees
and commissions. Quite kind, really.
But that is not all Tony learned. Many of those to whom the Baroness
granted the privilege of office disliked her. For instance, the man who
became her Chancellor, Sir Geoffrey Howe, did so with venom.
Now surely that couldn't be the case with that nice Gordon Brown, even
if he does smile at the wrong time, or the warm, cuddly Robin Cook.
(Much of what has been alleged against Mr Cook is particularly
inaccurate; I know, because as a horse-racing enthusiast he had good
reason to miss Tony's last keynote speech -- he had to attend the
running of a selling hurdle race at Fontwell).
But should there be any doubters in the party, then, like the
Baroness, Tony is certain he can overcome them. After all, it is all
about values rather than policies. The Baroness had her Victorian values
and so has he. Just look at his every eager lieutenant Jack Straw's
pronouncement on getting ''winos and beggars off the streets''.
As every socialist schoolboy knows, the reason these sad individuals
have fallen thus far is a result of the Combination Acts and the
Massacre at Peterloo. But to the modernisers it is more recent than
that. Our Jack, that former firebrand of the NUS, was just about to say
it but stopped himself in time. It is that taboo Victorian word
''fecklessness'', not used in British politics since Gladstone did his
Hugh Grant, scouring the streets for fallen women.
Not that Tony knows what to do about it, what the reasons are for this
depravation, the underlying causes of this social dislocation -- nor is
there ever the promise of that panacea so beloved of social workers. A
council-funded counselling service. Just think about the number of jobs
that would create, but no, that would be a policy decision, and what
Tony is talking about is values.
Ageism for example. It is an outrage that employers should have the
right to choose people they think are best fitted for a job. Why should
a graduate be given the opportunity to programme computers when a
62-year-old redundant fish gutter is available? And why is it that all
those couriers we see rushing about on motorbikes in cities are mostly
young men when there is a plethora of arthritic grannies available with
time on their hands. Tony rightly wants answers to these questions.
And, finally, it is just not true that he is evasive on policy. It is
only that he has a different way of looking at it. Just like Julie
Walters who plays a gauche, mature student in the film Educating Rita.
Asked in an essay question how she would solve the staging problems in
Ibsen's Peer Gynt she replies: ''Do it on the radio.'' Go for it Tony.

A CHAP from Kilwinning, Ayrshire's Burgh of Culture, has emerged as a
leading expert on the psychology of violence, cruelty, and serial
murder. He is Andrew O'Hagan, author of The Missing, a book which delves
into the darker side of humanity.
O'Hagan's book is a robust examination of such horrors as the Jamie
Bulger and Frederick West cases and other people who murdered, were
murdered, or who have simply disappeared. The subject matter, allied to
a fine writing style with dark sociological overtones, has made him
something of a hit with the London literary luvvies.
There is also the morbid fascination of the book's true confessions of
being a childhood perpetrator of nasty doings on fellow young
Kilwinningites and passing dumb animals.
Andrew may have moved to the Big Smoke but he has not forgotten his
Ayrshire pals who were out in force this week for the Scottish launch of
The Missing. (Publishers Picador, who picked up the tab for the canapes
and loads of drink, described the venue, the Winter Gardens in Glasgow
Green, erroneously but picturesquely as ''The Glasshouse''.)
We asked Andrew's chums their opinions of the book and they were
suitably cruel. ''It's no' very interesting,'' said one, quaffing
Picador's white wine. ''Everybody dies at the beginning.''
''It's no' exactly a day at the beach,'' said another, swallowing a
bottle of Beck's. But they were just joking. They always knew Andrew was
a smart lad and good at the writing and that.
* ONE of Andrew's mates was good enough to bring us a tale from
Kilwinning about a recent visit by the TV licence detector van. They
were making a spot check on an abode but just as they knocked on the
door, the man of the house was leaving to go to work. (Obviously an
apocryphal story.)
They explained what they were after and the man, relieved at the good
luck of actually having bought a TV licence, said he was in a hurry but
his wife would deal with it. They would find the document behind the
clock on the mantelpiece.
The detector van chap duly spoke to the wife and said they had come to
check the TV licence. ''I don't know where it is,'' she said. ''It's
behind the clock on the mantelpiece,'' he replied.
''That must be an awfy powerful detector van you've got,'' she said.
Commie-cal
THE New Statesman guide to Britain's trade unions, published to
coincide with the TUC annual conference, tells us that the
general-secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress is Mr Bill
Spiers. This should make interesting reading for Campbell Christie who
is still going around under the impression that this was his job. That's
the trouble with these Stalinist organisations, we suppose.
Rothesay rodeo
ROTHESAY becomes a little bit of the US the weekend after next on the
occasion of the Bute International Country Festival. You will not be
able to move for Appalachian clog dancers and the like.
Being an international festival, the organisers have turns such as
Cowboy Ernie Sites, rodeo star and singer from Idaho, cheek by jowl with
the Pigmeat Country Blues Band from Barrhead. There is also an ace
country dance formation team, which goes by the name of the Honky Tonk
Bar Association, from Llandudno.
But the person we are most looking forward to is an Algonquin Indian
story-teller whose name is Talks Louder Than Wind. He is making the trip
despite having a wounded knee, an accident suffered during a ceilidh. At
least that is what festival organiser Danny Kyle tells us and, we ask
you, would he tell a lie?
Hi-tech howler
WE get to read some interesting publications at the Diary and today it
is the Glenigan Group Sales Leads, a weekly information bulletin listing
building projects ongoing in Scotland. This publication has fallen foul
of a practice all too common in the world of print these days, when an
operative types in a few words such as ''Put in headline here about
boring trainspotters'' or ''Take in Michael Forsyth's ugly mug''.
The idea is, of course, to remove these references before the
publication goes to print. But it doesn't always happen. Which is why
Glenigan Group Sales Leads, reporting a development of a new #4.3m
theatre and film complex at Glasgow University, gives the details as:
''sod off you crap two-bit toaster and stop pretending you are a
computer'' and also ''you are still crap, not worthy of an electric
toothbrushing''. Great stuff, this technology.
Ale stones
WE have been sifting through the menu of beers which will be available
at the upcoming Glasgow Ale Festival. Among the delights on offer are
several varieties of stone beer.
Beer out of a stone? Unfortunately not. Stone beer is so called
because during the brewing process white-hot rocks are plunged into the
brew which gives it a smoky flavour.
Is a beer with a smoky flavour nearly as delicious and flavoursome as
smoky bacon crisps? It appears so. One of the smoky beers is Aecht
Schlenkerla Rauchbier which, we are informed, tastes like liquidised
kippers.
Also on offer is King Billy Bitter from the Cropton brewery in North
Yorkshire. It is decribed as having ''hints of orange''. We will try
almost anything, honestly, but perhaps not the ominously entitled
Whistle Belly Vengeance, which presages uncomfortable visions of the
morning after.

A big man in the wee hours, Radio 4 presenter James Naughtie doesn't
do things by halves, as John Linklater finds to his cost
TO gain a sense of the natural gusto of James Naughtie it is useful to
witness him attacking his breakfast. This may seem like an invasion but
if you are buying it, and the bill comes to #28, including your own
modest participation with an orange juice and a coffee, you might claim
a certain impresario stake in the performance.
Besides, as a presenter of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Naughtie
crashes the early morning privacies of an audience caught at its most
vulnerable. It is a delicate stage of the day, open-pored and exposed,
when his voice achieves that tricky intimacy of breaking the news over
breaking fasts.
But never over his own. He always saves eating his for later. This
involves heroic discipline and self-sacrifice, given that his morning
starts with a 3.30 alarm and it is close to 10am before he gets out of
the BBC. In the aquarium tank of the studio, where the Today team
broadcasts live for two hours, it is difficult to imagine what they
could feed him, apart from ants' eggs and a few protein flakes. Toast
offends the sensitivity of microphones. Naughtie waits. Over Portland
Place to the Langham Hilton, another programme wrapped up, he is
entitled to go about things expansively when we get our table.
What amazes most is not what he eats, or how much, or how often he
returns for more. This is negotiated thoroughly, a one-sided interview
between a legitimate appetite and a big pile of bacon, sausage, baked
beans, kedgeree and potatoes. For his second helping, hold only the
beans.
The spectacle lies in Naughtie's ability to keep talking while he does
it. It is the same kind of facility that keeps him nattering on air
while producers and editors are chewing his ears. It must lie somewhere
between an ability to concentrate through distractions and a supreme
obliviousness to everything except the sound of his own voice.
The amazing thing is the handling of knife and fork in a series of
rapid digging and shovelling manoeuvres, then downing tools to
gesticulate as he speaks. Even an errant potato, escaping from plate to
table, will not impede his tradesmanlike application to the job. He
retrieves it on the point of his knife and refits it in his mouth. You
feel he ought to have an apprentice alongside him.
It is all a matter of timing that can only come with years of
experience. In the studio this is what makes for smart handovers,
cutting people off at the right moment and preserving little cairns of
silence on top of every hour for the BBC sacrosanct of the pips. In
conversation over breakfast, it is all about saving the mechanical
business of chewing and swallowing for strategically created pauses in
speech. You can't interrupt, because he is deft in keeping you hanging.
''The programme comes out at an intimate time of day, trying to do two
things. One is . . .'' and the pause comes here, to gather a mouthful,
''. . . to inform, to keep up-to-date, to hit people with what's going
on, to be accurate, fast, to be journalistically on top of the story.
But also . . .'' and he pops another half sausage, ''. . . at six-thirty
in the morning, unless you're a very peculiar sort of chairman of ICI
starting your first breakfast meeting, you're getting up, brushing your
teeth, getting the kids ready for school, nursing a hangover or
whatever. It's got to have a tone that's very human.''
The most considerate thing about Naughtie on air is that he fights to
suppress his own runaway enthusiasms which, unchecked, might threaten to
overwhelm listeners. Today editor, Roger Mosey, remembers when Naughtie
was presenting the World At One programme and the announcement came over
of John Major and Douglas Hurd standing to oppose Mrs Thatcher in the
1990 Tory leadership election.
Naughtie started waving his arms in the air with such vigour that his
headphones fell off. The problem was that he was at that moment in the
middle of an interview down the line. It was completed with difficulty.
Listeners were spared the prospect of a presenter, on hands and knees on
the studio floor, trying to retrieve his cans. Radio has its blessings.
These days Naughtie manages to contain himself. His delivery is
measured, painstakingly precise. Only a slightly higher pitch betrays
his rising excitement. He has maintained the integrity of his Banffshire
accent to a remarkable degree, considering the predictable hostility it
first aroused with xenophonic Radio 4 listeners.
It was the ''President Bush says'' outrage. They heard his ''says''
rhyming with ''plays'', his ''Bush'' with a French bouche, and they
wished he would shut his. Familiarisation has stemmed complaints.
Ratings show that Naughtie's appeal is strongest among the younger
audience. Co-presenters Sue McGregor and John Humphreys are the darlings
of the South and the North respectively, but Naughtie's style goes down
best with the programme's segment of 25 to 34-year-olds.
Mosey did an Any Questions from Kenilworth recently and a woman told
him that when Naughtie first arrived on Radio 4 she didn't like him. On
Today she warmed to him. Seeing him on television, introducing the
Proms, she had decided he was ''edible''. ''So, Jim's a sex symbol in
Warwickshire,'' he reports.
This might partially explain why he appears to feel uncomfortable with
television. He despises personality cult, insists that he remains first
a journalist (a former lobby correspondent of The Scotsman and The
Guardian) and he resents any line of questioning that implies that
television would represent a promotion from radio.
The Today programme suits him because it is concerned with the moment.
It is adrenalin. ''I don't think you could do this job if you weren't an
enthusiast,'' he says. ''But you also have to have an element of
scepticism. You've got to have a questioning mind, a suspicious nature
if you like. I think you have to be excited by an encounter with someone
who matters, where you're looking eyeball to eyeball. If you lose that
excitement, you really should get out.''
His interviewing technique is politely tenacious. Only when pitched
against a leading politician will he resemble a camel driver hitting a
festering sore with a stick. He calls the big interviews ''encounters'',
and admits that he keeps score on who came out best. ''So do they,'' he
adds.
It is basically about asking the question that everyone listening
would want to ask, Naughtie feels, but he permits himself the
spontaneous interjection designed to reveal unexpected facets. ''But you
are a human being as well as a politician, Prime Minister,'' he suddenly
ventured with a straight-batting John Major in an interview this year.
''Now, Jim, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me,'' Major
replied flirtatiously. ''You'll ruin this programme's reputation if you
go on like that.''
At 43 he is likely to go on for a long time. At each stage of his
broadcasting career he has had to follow figures who have become BBC
institutions -- William Hardcastle and Robin Day on World At One, Brian
Redhead on Today -- and establish his own voice. This might suggest a
single-minded careerism, except that he is notoriously ''scatty''. When
he married, several thousand pounds were reputedly collected in loose
change he had been scattering for years on the floors of his bachelor
flat.
Naughtie is easily at his most methodical over breakfast, yours and
his own. ''The problem is what to do after nine o'clock,'' he reflects
over a polished plate. ''I find that you're quite hyped up. It's
exhilarating. The problem is coming down.'' It is almost ten-thirty in
the morning.
* James Naughtie will chair a special readers' Question Time debate,
Setting The Agenda, at the Marriott Hotel on the evening of September
20. In the panel will be Herald columnists Alf Young and Ruth Wishart
along with Roger Mosey, editor of Radio 4's Today programme, and a guest
from the Liberal Democrat Conference. Free tickets are available from
Radio 4 Today Debate, Herald Marketing Department, 195 Albion Street,
Glasgow G1 1QP.

KEITH BRUCE sets the scene for tonight's Herald/Tramway discussion on
cross-media collaboration in the arts.
IT is tempting -- and artists and journalists are some of the most
seducible people -- to put the current evidence of crumbling barriers
down to that end-of-the-century thing. As the Government prepares to
throw money at the millennium (money raised on the hopes of people
prepared to invest a few pounds in the chance of a brighter future)
commentators see the structures of society disintegrating and aim to
create work that challenges an uncertain audience -- or merely
pontificate in print.
At the same time it is equally obvious that structures within the arts
themselves are as vulnerable. The two open forums at Glasgow's Tramway
that have already taken place this year have illustrated the point well.
One came about directly in response to criticism in The Herald of an
exhibition at the venue, Trust, and showed the visual arts community to
be polarised between those who champion ''new'' conceptual art and those
who favour ''traditional'' painting. The second questioned the direction
of -- and even the necessity for -- the city's annual festival, Mayfest.
Sharp words were spoken at both, but there did seem to be common
agreement about the worth of such events. Hence the season of Tramway
Discussions this autumn, which are being presented in association with
The Herald. The first of these is tonight at 6pm, immediately before the
performance programme of Tramway's Dark Lights season kicks off with
Victoria Beattie's Bloodbirds -- A Recipe for Survival by Glasgow-based
company, Crush.
The season aims to present new work from Scotland that ignores
accepted divisions between artforms. Tramway can fairly lay claim to
having been at the forefront of presenting such work to a Glasgow
audience, but it can also be seen in Michael Boyd's programme at the
Tron and at the Centre for Contemporary Arts, and before that the Third
Eye, as well as in many site specific works.
This spirit of collaboration is usually seen as a positive thing, but
almost always by those who are close to the work. The results can often
be alienating for audiences who prefer work to have definable
characteristics and tensions between the collaborators can as easily
never be resolved as produce some new and exciting combination.
John Murphy, the Scottish Arts Council's director of combined arts,
confirms the trend. ''There are a number of individual artists coming
forward who want to work in other disciplines. A musician wanting to
work with a writer and a dancer is unlike theatre pulling artists in
from other disciplines. Artists seem to want to work in a cross-media
way.''
For the arts-attending public, the question is whether the
preconceptions that have informed the enjoyment of events should be
jettisoned as valueless.
A list of new work seen in Glasgow this year which depends on
collaboration would include such varied work as Nation at Tramway at
Mayfest, NVA's Stormy Waters at Meadowside Quay, and the current tour of
Gold by State Theta. Donna Rutherford is doing her own ignoring of
boundaries at the CCA this weekend and the Dark Lights season adds
Process (Ten:28), Clanjamfrie, and Dudendance, to name only three.
Cross-media or crossed wires? The value of collaboration will be under
the microscope tonight.
*The Herald/Tramway discussion is in Tramway 1 from 6pm tonight. You
can also join the debate on the Internet at newsgroup
rec.arts.theatre.plays:Dark Lights: New Scottish Theatre.

SEASIDE snapshots. The venue's febrile school-gymnasium atmosphere,
shrieking teens and volleyball courts marked out on the wooden floor. A
votive bra flung on to the stage. Dunoon's laddies and lassies
transformed into a cockney chorus by the power of pop.
Blur in Dunoon? The hippest band in the universe in a resort which
only narrowly heads Rothesay for unalloyed sophistication? Yes and yes.
While the notion might seem strange, out-of-the-way tours are
well-established rock business practice. A band's regular metropolitan
fans travel for what becomes an adventurous occasion. Far-flung natives,
deprived of big names, are guaranteed to go bananas for Moira Anderson,
let alone Damon Albarn and company. Under the gaze of the press,
hysteria ensues, dispelling any sense of a band having peaked.
And so it proved last night: a grateful crowd going potty, a muscular
band discovering fresh life in British musical pastures left untilled
since the arch Home Counties vowel sounds of Ziggy Stardust.
The retro references don't end there of course. Blur make positive use
of ancient fairground organ noises; the chirpy cynicism of the Small
Faces; Ray Davies's world-weary flair for observational storytelling;
Jimmy Pursey's sing-along punk. All of this put together into a knowing
knees-up for the nineties.
Literate, tuneful, sixties-inspired guitar pop, cranked out very loud
by nice middle-class boys with oikish accents and a social conscience:
its allure remains undimmed. We do like getting Blurred beside the
seaside.

FOLLOWING the lead of the Royal Lyceum Company which took to the road
while its building was being refurbished a few seasons back, the Brunton
is going out to the people of East Lothian while its own home is being
modernised. After this week's run at the other end of Musselburgh it
will tour to Port Seton, Dunbar, and Haddington, with any luck drawing
new audiences to its work, especially important now that its funding
comes almost entirely from the local authority.
I don't suppose Driving Miss Daisy will put off too many of those new
audiences, though personally it's a play I find whimsical and
ill-structured. Describing the 25-year relationship between an elderly
white woman living in the heart of racist Georgia and her slightly
younger black chauffeur, Alfred Uhry's drama is far more filmic than
theatrical. I haven't seen the film version, but it must surely cope
better with the passage of time, the endless car journeys, and the
subtle, internal character shifts that have little in the way of a stage
dynamic.
That said, Robin Peoples's production has a lot of warmth about it.
After an unremarkable first half, in which the latent racism is
disappointingly underplayed, the three actors -- Kay Gallie as Miss
Daisy, Gregor Duncan as her son, and Jimi Rand as the chauffeur -- build
an emotional rapport with the audience thanks to well-rounded,
sympathetic performances, though more friction earlier on would give
greater weight to the humanitarian moderation at the play's close.

THE Duke of Westminster, one of Britain's wealthiest men, ventured
into the world of second-hand clothes yesterday to declare a charity
shop open.
The shop in Belgravia, London, will sell only designer fashions. The
duke has given the premises rent-free for six months to the National
Kidney Research Fund.
With price tags ranging from a few pounds to a few hundred pounds, the
shop will be an important source of income for the charity, of which the
duke became president after losing an old friend to kidney failure.
Anyone who donates clothes to the shop will share the proceeds with
the charity.

One cannot envisage Mr Hurd having a chat with his bank manager about
the size of his overdraft and successfully pleading poverty
Just how does a backbench MP manage to make ends meet in these tough
times? As William Russell finds, one can always talk things over with
the bank
EVERYONE knows Douglas Hurd needs the money. For years we have been
told at regular intervals that he is not a rich man, and has two young
children to educate. Since most of his working life has been spent
either in the diplomatic service or politics this is undoubtedly the
case, since neither profession offers opportunities to lay up great
wealth -- at least in the case of the latter.
He lost not only his ministerial salary when he retired as Foreign
Secretary earlier this summer, but also his grace-and-favour homes in
Carlton Gardens and Chevening, very useful places to have at one's
disposal. He now has to make do on a backbench MP's pittance of #33,189
a year and pay for somewhere to rest his head near Westminster when he
is not at home in his Oxfordshire constituency.
Actually, there is an additional #42,754 for office and secretarial
expenses -- many MPs use their wives as secretaries to keep some of it
in the family -- and a living allowance, for those with constituencies
outside inner London, of #11,661 as well as free travel on parliamentary
business by land, sea or air between Westminster, home and the
constituency.
Things are slightly better than they may seem but it remains, given
the costs an MP who does his job properly must bear, a pittance.
Mr Hurd, who could eke things out by having his wife Judy, a former
Commons secretary, go back to work, will be standing down at the next
General Election so he cannot count on his MP's money for much longer.
As an author, his other source of income, he is not in the Jeffrey
Archer class, although he could earn a respectable income from doing the
international celebrity lecture circuit like Lady Thatcher and Henry
Kissinger have done. So his rush into the marketplace is understandable.
The shelf-life of an ex-Minister these days is not all that long.
But does he need as much as the #200,000-plus a year he is allegedly
going to earn? The NatWest bank, whose board he is to join on a one-year
contract as a non-executive director next month, insisted yesterday that
the reports of anything up to #250,000 for a three-day week were pure
speculation. The exact sum still had to be negotiated, it said.
The #250,000-a-year figure NatWest did not dispute. It is, apparently,
the going rate, give or take.
The sum at issue is the amount he could earn as deputy chairman of the
group's global investment arm, NatWest Markets, which will provide the
much-needed jam on his non-executive bread and butter. This sum is still
to be negotiated, but even NatWest admitted the suggestion he could earn
anything up to #250,000 was not pie-in-the-sky. It was what City
analysts had estimated his likely take-home pay, based on what others in
similar positions had raked in, could be.
The October date for taking his seat puts Mr Hurd outside the
three-month period former Ministers are expected to observe when taking
up such jobs, according to the recommendations of the Nolan Committee on
standards in public life.
Mr Hurd has done nothing wrong, and says he has consulted the
committee about his plans. He is undoubtedly qualified to help NatWest.
His global contacts, quite apart from those inside the present
Government, are wide-ranging, arguably unsurpassed. The bank is not
buying a pig-in-a-poke.
He is admirably qualified to advise it on the political risks of
investing in some foreign countries, information which could be acquired
for a lot less if bankers read newspapers. But it would not sound half
as authoritative. It seems bankers, while good at analysing economic
factors, according to NatWest, find political stability a wild card.
This seems strange. Economic factors are, after all, intangibles,
whereas political stability is as plain as a pikestaff. Soldiers on the
streets, martial law, Amnesty International on the rampage, the UN
sending in troops and the International Red Cross setting up relief
centres are hard not to see with one's own eyes. They indicate something
is rotten in the state of wherever it occurs.
On the other hand, the ambassadorial role envisaged by Martin Owen,
chief executive of NatWest Markets, in which Hurd will meet clients and
represent the investment bank, will fit him like a glove. Hurd could
sell second-hand cars to anybody. The bank is keen to increase its
interests in the Far East and Hurd, who is well-known in Hong Kong,
Beijing and points east, could be their man.
Mind you, the job as deputy chairman of a subsidiary, while lucrative,
is not half as good as ex-Cabinet Ministers have landed in the past.
Anthony Barber, who was Edward Heath's Chancellor of the Exchequer, a
man whose reputation in the job is unsurpassed in post-war years -- he
is generally reckoned to have been the worst of the lot -- went on to
spend 10 years as chairman of Standard Chartered; Tom Boardman, a
long-forgotten and not very distinguished trade Minister, was chairman
of NatWest for much of the 1980s; and Lord Young, once one of Lady
Thatcher's blue-eyed peers, has been running Cable and Wireless, for
better or for worse, for five years.
But what do the people at NatWest who deal with the man in the street
get paid? A lot less than #1000 a day, which is what the tabloids have
calculated Hurd can expect in his bank account.
His expertise, however it may help NatWest in its higher financial
dealings, is not going to be used helping anybody with their overdraft
or their mortgage. A branch bank manager, the man who does, gets on
average #28,840, while a teller, who deals regularly with the public,
gets #10,454 on average. Somehow one cannot envisage Hurd having a chat
with his bank manager about the size of his overdraft and successfully
pleading poverty.
Labour, of course, cried sleaze. They would, wouldn't they? But Hurd
is not a man of sleaze. He is an honourable man, an old-age pensioner
trying, like every other old-age pensioner under a Tory Government who
has spent his working life in an underpaid job, to ensure that he has a
happy retirement with the wolf well away from the door.
Perhaps Labour if, or when, it comes to power should introduce a
national maximum wage for ex-Ministers. But the Nimby principle will
almost certainly prevent that happening.

DESPITE constraints on public funding, the higher education sector in
Scotland has maintained a high standard of quality in the past year, it
was claimed yesterday in Edinburgh.
According to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, the group
which distributes taxpayers' money to universities, policies have
assisted universities and colleges to cope with ''difficult
circumstances''.
Presenting the council's annual report, chairman Professor Sir John
Shaw said the council's experience had shown the robustness of policies
in many areas, including funding, financial monitoring, and quality
assessment.
He pointed out that in its contribution to a review of higher
education, the unique quality of the Scottish system had to be
emphasised, while enabling institutions to play a full part in the
international academic community.
He said: ''Higher education in Scotland is a vital part of the
intellectual and economic life of the nation.
''As pressure on public expenditure increases, it is the council's job
to help develop the quality, effectiveness, and competitiveness of
Scottish higher education, while delivering genuine value for money in
the use of scarce resources.''
The report showed that #544m was distributed in the last financial
year, with student numbers increasing by more than 3%.
Included in a section of the report were figures showing that in 155
reports on the quality of teaching, more than 20% of provision was
assessed as excellent, and 2% as unsatisfactory.
Professor Shaw said that it was hoped that education would continue
into the next century with its traditional strengths, diversity, and
distinctiveness.

EVERY time I see Coppelia, I discipline myself to concentrate on the
dancing -- no particular hardship here, for Maria Teresa del Real and
Campbell McKenzie make an eyecatching, lively pair of lovers. Some of
the ensemble work is a tad raggedy still, and one or two of the soloists
undid themselves by trying too hard. But, by and large, things chugged
along well enough.
Oh dear . . . ''chugged''. Sorry, but however much I try, the
relentless whimsicality of the ballet always gets through to me.
Coppelia, in this scenario, errs on the wrong side of quaint.
At its heart is a dark and seething situation: an obsessed and
reclusive scientist who -- like Frankenstein -- seeks to create life.
Beyond the conjuror's hocus-pocus and hand-waving -- which Robert
Hampton does with a duffer's benign flourish -- lurks a thoroughly nasty
truth. Dear old daffy Coppelius is prepared to -- indeed is already in
the process of -- sacrificing Frantz in order to animate a mechanical
doll.
It's not a party trick out of Drosselmeyer's repertoire, but it is
cheerfully passed off as such. Hey ho. Maybe Mark Morris or Matthew
Bourne -- both of whom have looked through the spun sugar of perennial
Nutcrackers with shrewd success -- will one day give Coppelia the dark,
dramatic edge it cries out for.
In the meantime, if Scottish Ballet are going to continue with this
production (bought in from Birmingham Royal Ballet with additional
choreography from Peter Wright), might they consider new designs? The
mirk that shrouds Coppelius's workshop in Act II almost prevents us
seeing his magical automata.
Shining through regardless, however, is Maria Teresa del Real. She
mimics the doll-like movements with precision and wit, melting into
sudden fleetness for the Spanish and Scottish dances. She brings a
lovely sparky character to the sometimes spoilt Swanilda, but oh how one
wishes she could see through the appalling laddishness that Campbell
McKenzie brings out so brilliantly in Frantz. When these two are on
stage the whole piece crackles with energy; it's almost as if a
mechanical doll could be brought to life if enough youthful elan were
poured into it.

SEMA, the information technology group, believes it has scored a
notable coup with its Glasgow-based BAe-Sema joint venture company
winning the management contract for the design and building of a #40m
ocean survey vessel for the Royal Navy.
This is the first time such a prize has been taken from traditional
shipbuilders.
The company is also engaged in ship life extension including naval
vessels at Rosyth and is bidding for the next stage of the
de-commissioning of the Dounreay nuclear facility, where a major
contract for the removal of the sodium coolant will soon be awarded.
The French-controlled company increased half-time pre-tax profits 13%
to #16m and raised the dividend 19% to 1.9p.

THE New Shakespeare Company's production of The Music Man arrived at
the Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, this week from the Open Air Theatre in
London's Regents Park.
Meredith Willson's Broadway smash, first performed nearly 40 years
ago, is the story of Professor Harold Hill, a fast-talking,
double-crossing conman, and the magical effect he has on the sleepy
Southern town of River City, Iowa.
Hill's trick is to sell expensive instruments to local children with
the promise that he will conduct them in a gleaming brass band. With the
money in his pocket, however, he makes off before a note is played. But
River City turns out to be different -- the professor falls in love.
Taking the title role in this production is Brian Cox, an actor whose
singing and dancing talents have hitherto lain dormant, and his
performance as the loveable rogue is warm and entertaining.
There is a rich comic vein in this musical, and while Cox clearly
relishes his new-found role as Mr Funny, he is ably assisted by Nick
Holder as his wisecracking sidekick, and Veronica Clifford as the vain
and bustling Eulalie Shinn.
Played out on a clever impressionistic set that subtly evokes
small-town Americana, The Music Man is a lively show, full of warmth and
humour which will have the audience singing 76 Trombones long after the
final curtain.

A SOCIAL work senior care officer has been jailed for 30 months for
repeatedly sexually assaulting three women with learning difficulties.
Bachelor Roy Denman, 48, committed the offences in his classroom at
the Hallcraig Centre, Airdrie, over an 11-year period between 1983 and
1995.
Airdrie Sheriff Court heard yesterday that Denman would touch the
women's private parts both outside and inside their clothing while
others in the class were busy working.
One victim, now aged 39, told police she did not want Denman to do it,
but he had told her not to tell anyone.
Fiscal Ann Ferguson told the court that a subsequent allegation by
that woman led to Denman, of Morrison Street, Douglas Water, by Lanark,
making a full admission.
Mrs Ferguson said Denman had been based at the Hallcraig Centre since
1983.
The 39-year-old victim said she was assaulted persistently. She
suffered from a mental handicap and, according to Mrs Ferguson, was of
low intelligence and self-esteem, with childlike behaviour and a trust
of authority.
The other two women, aged 33 and 42, made similar allegations to the
police.
Interviewed by police, Denman said the incidents took place when he
was ''lonely or low''.
Mrs Ferguson said: ''These victims were vulnerable and Mr Denman was
in a position of trust.''
Lawyer Ian Scott said his client was full of remorse and aware of the
gravity of the offences. Mr Scott added: ''He was immediately dismissed
from his job and sought medical help.''

science were being undermined by cuts in Government spending. She told
delegates that by 1997 Government departments would have cut 25% from
their expenditure on research and development since l993.In calling for
measures to improve the amount of money invested in science, she asked:
''Why bother? Do we realy need science? What would life be life be like,
without a few scientific inventions such as the transistor, microchip or

Anne Johnstone examines the fall-out engulfing the nuclear industry
after procedures at the Wylfa reactor were found to be flawed
NUCLEAR Electric has much more to lose at Mold Crown Court today than
the ''six-figure'' fine Mr Justice Morland is proposing to impose on the
soon-to-be-privatised company. In recent years the British nuclear power
industry has spent many times that figure on attempting to convince a
sceptical public that it has such cast-iron safety procedures that a
disaster on the scale of Chernobyl or Three-Mile Island simply couldn't
happen here.
It was a propaganda battle they appeared to be winning. Nuclear
Electric had spent #27.9m on the two reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey as
part of a long-term safety review. In 1993 the power station had
received a Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents Gold Award for
its safety record.
The centrepiece of the industry's safety strategy is a principle known
as ''defence in depth''. Yesterday a Nuclear Electric spokeswoman
described this principle thus: ''There are so many safety measures, that
really it is almost impossible for anything to happen without making
alarm bells ring.''
In view of some of the evidence presented in Mold this week, this
definition may seem rather unfortunate. It is precisely because alarm
bells did not ring at Wylfa on the night of July 31, 1993, that the
whole safety culture of Nuclear Electric is now being questioned.
At around 9.00 that night, an operative at the power station happened
to notice that something was missing. It was the tiny parasol-shaped
metal grab on the end of the remote-controlled crane used to replace the
reactor's spent fuel elements. There was no indication where it had
gone. In fact it had slid down a long chute into the top of one of the
Magnox reactor's 6150 gas-cooled graphite fuel channels. (Each channel
contains eight uranium-powered fuel elements, laid end to end.)
''If he had known the part was inside the reactor, possibly he would
have shut it down sooner but the instruments detected nothing wrong,''
said the spokeswoman. There were no raised temperature readings, or
indications that the nuclear fuel was damaged or the gas coolant
contaminated with radioactivity.
In the event the reactor was not shut down until nearly 4am the next
morning. This week Nuclear Electric changed its plea and admitted four
charges brought under the Health and Safety at Work Act. They will be
sentenced today.
The entirely inaccurate use of the word ''meltdown'' in court on
Tuesday by the QC representing the Health and Safety Executive, produced
some spectacularly hair-raising stories about what might have happened.
Yesterday morning the Press Association was telling journalists around
the country that ''the safety lapse at Wylfa atomic power station which
risked a nuclear meltdown raises the spectre of a Chernobyl-style
disaster in Britain''.
Amidst the panic that ensued, the QC, Hugh Carlisle, was forced to eat
his word. For ''meltdown'', he said, read ''melt''. This is completely
different.
A melt within a single channel might have led to a fire in that
particular channel and the release of radioactive particles. But these
particles would have been contained within the reactor unless a second
and unconnected serious incident had allowed the release of the coolant
gas from the reactor by depressurisation. In other words, Wylfa was
never a potential Chernobyl.
In a sense this faux pas was quite handy for Nuclear Electric. It
enabled them to present themselves as more sinned against than sinning
and distracted attention from the real issue: the company's supposedly
unassailable safety procedures which had been found to be worryingly
flawed.
Dr Sam Harbison, head of Britain's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate,
is not prone to exaggeration. Bridget Woodman of Greenpeace said
yesterday: ''The NII aren't renowned for being very vicious regulators.
They tend not to criticise the industry in public at all.'' So when Dr
Harbison told Mold Crown Court that the actions of Nuclear Electric
during the incident were ''a matter of grave concern'' clearly something
was very wrong.
Harbison was not worried that the Wylfa incident could have produced a
nuclear holocaust on Anglesey. Clearly it could not have done. Rather,
he was concerned that it indicated a failure of Nuclear Electric's
safety culture, a failure which could produce a more serious incident in
the future.
A retired senior nuclear inspector told The Herald yesterday: ''In
this situation I'd want to see the written evidence. I'd want to see
logged evidence that the right people were alerted immediately and that
the decisions taken had been on the basis of a systematic set of
observations.''
In court yesterday afternoon Nuclear Electric were not so specific.
''Throughout that period, men with vast experience were considering with
the utmost care what the implications of the situation they found
themselves in were,'' said their QC, Robert Owen. But this contrasted
with a tape-recording played in court earlier in which staff in the
station's control room laughed and giggled as details of the incident
unfolded.
Even worse, the HSE evidence revealed that shortly before the reactor
was eventually shut down, an operator discussed the financial loss that
the company would incur from the National Grid as a result of such a
move. Yesterday in court Nuclear Electric refuted that there was any
suggestion of commercial considerations taking part in the decision to
defer the shut down.
Nevertheless, Labour were quick to seize on the evidence as fuel for
their campaign to derail nuclear privatisation. ''Privatisation of the
nuclear electricity generating industry will exacerbate the conflict
between safety, accountability, profits, and dividends,'' said Shadow
Trade and Industry Secretary Jack Cunningham.
Woodman of Greenpeace said: ''The reason they didn't act sooner seems
to be because they were afraid of losing income. The question now must
be whether you can have faith in the safety culture of Nuclear Electric.
This case shows you can't.''
Nuclear Electric may find it easier to pay their fine than rebuild
their soiled reputation.

Soldier had book on hunting humans.
A TEENAGE soldier was ordered to be detained for 12 years yesterday
after a knife attack on a hotel chambermaid which she narrowly survived.
Norman Mackay, 18, was found to have a cache of literature, including
a book on serial killers, at the time he stabbed mother-of-two Kay
Harper 14 times, the High Court in Edinburgh heard.
Lord Mayfield told him: ''This was an appalling attack on a woman who
suffered terrible injuries. But for the skill of various medical persons
she might well have died.''
Mackay, of Alness, Easter Ross, pounced on his victim in the Osbourne
Hotel in York Place, Edinburgh, where he had checked in after going on
the run from the Army.
He admitted attempting to murder Mrs Harper, 28, on May 12 this year
by seizing her by the throat, pushing her on to a bed, and repeatedly
stabbing and cutting her with a knife.
Advocate-depute William Totten revealed that when police arrested
Mackay they found he had a book called Hunting Humans: The Encyclopaedia
Of Serial Killers, Volume II, by Michael Newton.
He said that Mackay also had two magazines: Shivers, and the May issue
of a Marvel publication entitled Clive Barker's Hellbreed, which showed
in comic strip form what appeared to be a drawing of a woman knife
attack victim.
Mackay had gone AWOL from the Army four days beforehand after deciding
that he could not stand the strict regime at his Catterick base.
Mr Totten said Mackay told Mrs Harper that he had just vacated his
room and she went in to start cleaning it. He then returned claiming to
have forgotten something before launching the horrific attack.
He pushed her on to a bed and plunged a diver's knife into her heart,
chest, arms, hands, and legs before walking out of the room without
uttering a word. Mrs Harper managed to crawl to the door and cry out for
help.
Paramedics who were quickly at the scene were convinced she would die,
but one managed to stop the blood loss from a severed artery through his
sheer physical strength. A team of surgeons at Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary's later operated for eight hours to save her.
Mr Totten said that Mrs Harper spent two months in hospital after the
attack and had gone through a great deal of psychological trauma.
Mr Edgar Prais QC, defending, said that Mackay, a first offender, had
joined the Army at 16 after leaving school without the required
qualifications for a college place.
He walked out of his Catterick base and drifted north. He had booked
into the Osbourne under a false name but using his correct address.
He remembered heading to the reception to check out. ''For some reason
he decided to go back to the room . . . the door was open and that's
when he saw the lady. He does not know why he did what he did,'' Mr
Prais said.
Mackay boarded a train bound for Perth, where he tried to scrub the
blood from his hands in a toilet.
''He said it was then as he saw the blood he realised something
terrible had happened. This is a crime without a motive, without any
explanation, without any possible benefit,'' Mr Prais said.
Mackay travelled to Inverness and it was while watching a TV report on
the hotel attack that he realised what he had done. He was arrested the
next day in Alness.
Psychiatrists who examined Mackay said he showed no sign of mental
illness. The court heard that he had been brought up in Stornoway and
had been the victim of sexual and physical abuse as a youngster.

Margaret Vaughan discovers that the latest Conservative proposal to
shore up the crumbling facade of traditional family life seems to be
hitting a wall of scepticism
TODAY a gathering of Conservative women activists at the party's
Central Office will discuss a remarkable plan to pay a fidelity bonus to
those who stay married long enough to earn it.
It is the latest in a long line of Tory policy suggestions to restore
the strength of ''traditional'' families favoured, intellectually if not
always in practice, by a considerable number of past and present
Government Ministers.
The party has been pronouncing in public on the need to nurture family
life since the early eighties, when Mrs Thatcher chaired a Cabinet
Committee on Family Policy which came up with a diverse handbag of
proposals, never implemented, including one from Geoffrey Howe on how
children should be taught to manage their pocket money better.
Then John Major launched his ''Back to Basics'' campaign at the party
conference in 1993. This was followed by an unfortunate series of
scandals which exposed a considerable rift between the public utterances
and private conduct of some Ministers on their estimation of the value
of the family.
The campaign was dropped after the stories disclosed how some
Ministers preaching about the strength of family values had been a touch
economical with their own family actualite. The names Yeo, Mellor,
Parkinson, and Alan Clarke became synonymous with an altogether more
diverse set of familial values.
Annual marriage rates are now at a record low and divorce rates at an
all-time high. The social costs (not to mention the welfare costs) are
said to be alarming the Government. Once more, attempts to engineer
social change, stem the tide of divorce, and persuade people to wed
instead of shacking up, are under consideration.
While John Redwood's preferred answer to the rapid change in family
structures favours adoption for babies of single young mothers, the
Conservative women prefer the carrot of a 10th anniversary tax break
over the stick-wielding initiatives of the right.
It is a thought, certainly, said Aberdeen sociology professor Steve
Bruce, an analyst of social policy, although not one that he appears to
take awfully seriously. His further observations on the proposal were,
unfortunately, lost in what may have been a bad cough but sounded more
like a prolonged bout of heaving, gusting mirth.
''Are you serious?'' he wheezed, eventually. No, but the Conservative
women's national committee, chaired by Dame Joyce Anelay, most certainly
is.
''How big would the financial incentive have to be?'' Professor Bruce
wondered. ''Are you really suggesting that unhappy people on the brink
of divorce will say 'hang on, how much dosh would we get to stick it
out?' '' he choked. No, but the Conservative women polled by the
national committee are.
A survey of female party members revealed a majority in favour of
married couples being rewarded with the tenth anniversary payout. The
proposal will go forward, along with 349 others from the same source, to
the Downing Street policy unit. The analysis of the women's views is
said to be part of a wider consultation exercise called Our Nation's
Future geared to gathering ideas for future policy-making.
''It's bizarre, especially coming from the party which has such an
exemplary record of keeping families together,'' Professor Bruce said.
The proposal comes after the Prime Minister initiated a study headed
by Norman Blackwell at the Downing Street policy unit into ways of
encouraging so-called traditional families.
He may discover what social policy analysts, from the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation to independent policy think-tanks, have been saying for some
time: that over the past 10 years tax policies have not been kind to
families -- 62% of one-earner couples with children are worse off, while
65% of double-income couples without children have gained.
Ceridwen Roberts of the Family Policy Studies Centre was a bit more
polite than Professor Bruce in her reaction to the proposal, but equally
dismissive of the idea that a cash lure could avert marital breakdown:
''I'm not sure it's the right way to go about things. It's a little bit
far fetched.''
Denise Knowles, a counsellor with Relate, the marriage guidance
organisation, warned that it was unhealthy for couples to stay together
for financial reasons: ''Couples who stay together for a long time
deserve recognition and anything that focuses in on marriage should be
welcomed. But they may stay together for a long time and not always in a
stable relationship, or remain totally faithful to each other. There's
more to a relationship than money.''
The deputy director of One Plus One, a marriage research charity, was
equally sceptical: ''Society and individuals benefit from secure,
committed family relationships. These are difficult to achieve in the
current climate of economic uncertainty and rapid social change. The
support for marriage must begin early in people's lives.''
Dame Joyce, however, is stout in defence of the proposals, insisting
people who struggle to remain married ought to be given financial
recognition: ''While some marriages have to end, the feeling is that you
have to work at it. The easy answer is to walk away.''
At precisely what price a broken-down family would stay together is an
altogether more difficult question, requiring an altogether different
set of family values.

MINERS' president Arthur Scargill yesterday accused Labour leader Tony
Blair of telling unions to ''get stuffed''.
As Mr Scargill tried unsuccessfully to reignite the debate about
Labour's Clause 4, he told Congress that he did not want to see a Labour
government practising capitalism better than the Tories.
Labour had to put forward policies which would change society.
On the day after Mr Blair received a standing ovation, Mr Scargill
quoted from the old Clause 4 which, he said, was ''not a ghost from the
past'' but was relevant today.
The TUC Congress this week was approving policies in favour of full
employment and a minimum wage, Mr Scargill said.
''In spite of this, Tony Blair turned around and told this congress to
get stuffed. The tragedy was that after doing that you applauded,'' he
added.
There was a fear pervading the movement that it must do anything to
get a Labour government elected.
''I want to see a Labour government as much as anyone but not one
which practises capitalism better than the Tories, '' Mr Scargill said.
A motion by the National Union of Mineworkers which included a
reference to Clause 4 was defeated heavily by delegates.
Unison general secretary Rodney Bickerstaffe yesterday called for a
wider debate on the prospect of full employment.
In doing so, he told Congress that ''full employment is portrayed by
some as quaintly old fashioned, a nostalgia for the certainties of the
1950s'' but what critics forgot was that the ''so-called flexible
markets beloved by the Government are an even further throwback to the
nineteenth century.''
Mr Bickerstaffe proposed a move towards full employment through:
demand management leading to a period of above-average growth; improving
the the abilty of the economy to grow through greater investment, and
investment in education and training.

MORE than 400 children made their way through torrential rain and
flooding to get to school this week, only to be sent home because the
school had no water.
Mrs Margaret Mackay, head teacher of Keith Primary School, in
Grampian, said yesterday: ''People did not believe us. We could all feel
that disbelief coming across the phone when we informed parents.''
The pupils were in classes on Tuesday when the school was told about
9.30am that the water supply had been cut off.
''The water officials thought it would be a long job, so we had to
take a decision there and then. You cannot keep so many children in
school without water, for hygiene reasons, so we had to close the
school.''
Mr Bob Bryce, assistant divisional officer with Grampian's water
services department, explained that a water pipe leading to part of
Keith had been burst by the deluge.
''The burst left certain areas of Keith without tap water for a
time.''
The River Isla burst its banks in several places, and left large areas
of Keith under water.
A Grampian Regional Council spokesman said yesterday that officials
could take days to assess the cost of the damage throughout the region.
Cultercullen Primary School was still closed yesterday. Two small
bridges, Mannellie bridge, near Drumblade, and Fendraught bridge, near
Largue, were washed away.
A number of minor roads were still closed yesterday, but the rain had
stopped and the water levels of the rivers were going down.
After a morning structural inspection, the Deveron bridge at Turriff
on the B9025 Turriff-Aberchirder road was opened to traffic at lunchtime
yesterday after being closed for one-and-a-half days.
The Deveron had overflowed three times, reaching 14ft above normal.

GOVERNMENT attempts to privatise the nuclear power generating industry
are opposed strongly by the public and are likely to fail, according to
Labour and the industry's unions.
At a joint news conference in Brighton yesterday, they disclosed the
findings of a Mori poll showing that only 15% support privatisation,
with 60% against.
Labour Energy spokesman Martin O'Neill said he believed the findings
showed anxiety over safety in a privatised nuclear industry.
He could not give a commitment that a Labour government would
renationalise the industry, but said he hoped that privatisation could
be headed off or at least delayed until the election.
Mr Tony Cooper, general secretary of the Engineers' and Managers'
Association, predicted another setback for the Government, similar to
the ''debacle'' of Post Office and rail privatisations.

WILLIAM RUSSELL talks to Bertrand Tavernier about his depiction of
teenage killers in The Bait
YOUNG people who kill present society with the problem of why they do
it. The cinema has dealt with the topic a lot recently in films like
Fun, Heavenly Creatures and Natural Born Killers, but in The Bait, the
French director Bertrand Tavernier brings a peculiarly European
perspective to the issue. Unlike American directors, he offers no
excuses for the actions of killers, two boys and a girl.
There is no parental neglect or abuse, physical or sexual, no mental
instability, no bid to escape a deprived background. They are not
outsiders, just three ordinary middle-class young people.
''My wife Colo, who wrote the script, and I saw in the story a true
one which happened in 1984 in France; a way of showing what frightens us
about our society today,'' he said. ''These young people are not
deprived. They are not excluded from society. Many things are
responsible for their actions and you cannot blame one person or one
thing.
''I wanted to treat them as if they were my children's friends --
funny, touching, ignorant, stupid and unreasonable. I was raised by my
father with respect for the notion that we are responsible for our
actions, but these youngsters are totally irresponsible.
''But are they any different from great figures in France today like
Bernard Tapie? At the end the girl asks -- 'Am I going to be free for
Christmas?'
''The characters are confronted all the time by an atmosphere in which
people do not accept responsibility.''
Two boys, Eric and Bruno, use Eric's girlfriend, Nathalie, as bait to
attract men they believe wealthy so that they can rob them.
Nathalie (Marie Gillain), a would-be actress and shop assistant,
collects older men in nightclubs and bars, whom she feels might help her
longed-for career and keeps their addresses in a book. The boys' dream
is to open a shop selling cheap jeans in America, the land of
opportunity, and the address book is their passport to success and the
ten million francs they need. Two men are chosen to be robbed, both
robberies end, accidentally in the first instance, in murder.
''These three young people are impatient, they want it now. They don't
want to wait, and that is what is frightening about them,'' he said.
''In the computer age everything is instant.
''Young people live in the present, and the politicians have not
realised this. They do not understand the urgency. We have to learn to
deal with a whole generation. It is one of the most important political
problems today, but it is not something politicians discuss very much.''
Tavernier has kept the audience at a distance from the violence for
several reasons. ''Dealing with torture -- they kill the second man with
a penknife -- there are certain things you must not show,'' he said.
''It is part of the director's moral responsibility, especially now
violence has become so much more explicit in film. Maybe 10 or 20 years
ago I could have shown more, but now in every film you have heads blown
up and violence is accepted by the audience. It has become gratifying.
''The film will be seen by young people and I must not give them their
share of blood. For me the violence must be seen in Nathalie's face as
she listens to her Walkman in the hall, shutting out what is happening
behind the closed doors of the living-room.''
He believes young people, pressured by the media, become slaves of
images, facades and dreams so that they ignore reality, preferring
violence. Proof of this slavery to the image is the trio's belief that
all rich people have safes in their apartments hidden behind pictures,
and that the chosen men are rich, when they merely seem so. Their wealth
is a facade founded on credit and debt.

BENJAMIN Ross, writer and director of The Young Poisoner's Handbook,
an Edinburgh Film Festival prize-winner, is in no two minds about it --
he is unemployable, which is why he makes films. It is a chicken-and-egg
situation. Film-making was the only thing he ever wanted to do, but
there also came a point when he had been pushing at doors so long it was
impossible to go back. Then it became a case of making films or nothing.
He is only 31, and, by his own admission, a weirdo. The Young
Poisoner's Handbook, which he wrote with Jeff Rawle, best known as the
appalling George, the news editor in Drop the Dead Donkey, is his first
feature film, although he has made some short films. Hollywood has yet
to beckon, but he went there after the film was shown successfully at
this year's Sundance Festival. Would he work there? Silly question. He
loved the place, but intends to wait until he feels safe before trying
his luck.
''I would get paid a paltry sum at the moment, and if you are going to
sell out you might as well wait until you do it for real,'' he said. In
any case, he prefers Neasden, which is where his film is set and where
he was born.
The film is based on the true story of Graham Young, a Neasden youth
who was interested in poisons, poisoned his stepmother, tried to poison
his father, got found out and was sent to Broadmoor.
There he ''recovered'' and returned to the world where he got a job in
a factory. The factory happened to use his favourite poison, thallium,
in its manufacturing process and in no time Graham was poisoning the
staff. He was found out once again and returned to Broadmoor where he
died in 1990.
''Jeff and I took the story and spun a web round it,'' Ross said.
''It is about human failure, about Graham's failure to turn his life
into something creative. You don't see many films celebrating failure
and I think it is the subject.''
He said they had redeemed Graham in their second act, when he came out
of Broadmoor ''cured'', but took it away in the third when he reverted
to type.
''That will teach people to expect redemption and happy endings when
they go to the cinema.''

LABOUR Employment spokesperson Harriet Harman last night accused Board
of Trade President Ian Lang of ''grotesque scaremongering'' over claims
that a national minimum wage set at #4.15 an hour could cost about two
million jobs.
Speaking at Brighton in reaction to Mr Lang's claims in a radio
interview, she also called the Minister a hypocrite for dismissing the
US minimum, equivalent to about #2.83 an hour, as being too low to have
any impact.
Ms Harman maintained that a minimum set at this level would help a
million low-paid British workers.
She also took the opportunity to warn unions against seeking to use
the introduction of a minimum wage as a lever for increases for others
based on preserving differentials.
Earlier, TUC delegates united behind a composite motion apparently
conceding that it is the role of a Labour government to decide at what
level to introduce its promised national minimum wage.
However, at the same time, leaders of several key unions indicated
they would continue to press for an initial level of #4.15 an hour and
would vote for such a figure if it remained on the agenda for next
month's Labour Party conference.
Lobbying and cajoling by TUC leaders in recent weeks ensured that
amendments seeking to insert the figure of #4.15 were withdrawn from the
TUC agenda. Labour leaders no doubt will try to emulate their success.
However, no amount of stage managing could disguise the deep
divisisons between union leaders on how to implement the previously
agreed formula of an initial level of half median male earnings.
Meanwhile, Labour leader Tony Blair again emphasised his opposition to
fixing a figure for the minimum wage.
''My view is you can't set that except in the economic circumstances
of the time. You can't say now it is going to be #4, or #4.15, because
you don't know the economic circumstances you will inherit.
''It will be done sensibly, it will be done after consultation with
employers, but I think there should be a basic minimum,'' he said in an
interview with Jimmy Young on BBC Radio 2.
Any hopes TUC and Labour officials had of a trouble-free day at
Congress were shattered when women activists -- wearing white T-shirts
with the figure #4.15 -- staged a demonstration and forced TUC general
secretary John Monks to interrupt his opening speech.
Several speakers also wore prominent badges with the same message
demanding #4.15.
Mr Monks urged delegates not to spoil a mood of unity and the search
for a strong TUC position.
He promised that the TUC would publish a target figure for a national
minimum wage after further research later this year.
A LOW-PAID worker has told how she felt fortunate to be sacked from a
#3-an-hour job washing up in a pub to land shop work which paid
#3.15-an-hour.
The woman, from Bridport, Dorset, told the Low Pay Unit that when
working in the pub she was on her feet from 5pm to midnight with no tea
breaks, but ''fortunately'' she was ill one night and was sacked.
However, despite her increase in earnings, she receives no sick pay,
no holiday pay and along with other workers in the shop is not allowed a
tea break.
''We are expected to open up at 9am and work until 1pm without using
the lavatory or having tea or coffee if the shop is busy. Any complaints
would bring about our dismissal,'' she said.
Other recent cases reported to the Low Pay Unit include:
* A 40-year-old care assistant paid just #1.88-an-hour for a 30-hour
week who has had no pay rise for the past five years
* An advert in a London job centre for a hairdresser with seven years'
experience to work for #2.66-an-hour.
* A 42-year-old hairdresser paid #2.65-an-hour for a 40-hour week with
her pay dropping to #2.20-an-hour when she works as an assistant.
* A 20-year-old working as a chemist's assistant and paid
#2.70-an-hour.
* A 15-year-old working in a chemist shop on Saturday for just
#1.75-an-hour.
Meanwhile, the Transport and General Workers' Union yesterday reported
the case of a 56-year-old woman working one day a week at a DIY store in
Wales for #30.
She told how one day a man told her she would be working for him from
the next day.
''He ran a contract cleaning company and told me my wages would be cut
immediately to #15 and I'd have to be in by 8.30am instead of 9am. But
there was no bus that early in the morning so I had to leave,'' she
said.

Clint's squint makes Meryl Streep's day in a weepy love story of Oscar
proportions. Wringing his hanky, William Russell also visits a macabre
comedy and yawns at the banality of some thirtysomethings
NEW RELEASES
The Bridges of Madison County (12) directed by Clint Eastwood
The Young Poisoner's Handbook (15) directed by Benjamin Ross
Blue Juice (15) directed by Carl Prechzer
On general release. All films open tomorrow
COME, cry with me. If by the end of Clint Eastwood's gorgeous romantic
film, The Bridges of Madison County, you have not shed at least a tear
-- some of you will have shed buckets -- then your heart is made of
stone. It is even possible you are not a member of the human race.
Based on a best-selling book (by all accounts a truly terrible one) by
Robert James Waller, Eastwood, scriptwriter Richard LaGravenese, co-star
Meryl Streep, and his usual film crew have worked the alchemist's trick.
Literary lead has become pure Hollywood gold. If it does not sweep the
board come Oscar time then the members of the Academy really are
Philistines.
It is a weepy of the highest quality. A story of middle-aged love,
more November -- given the fact that Clint plays his age -- than
September Song, which restores Streep to her throne as Queen of
Hollywood and confirms Eastwood as a director who can bring the best out
in his actors. He allows Streep's talent full range, provides tactful,
generous and eloquent support as the man she loves and lets the story,
scripted with great intelligence by LaGravenese, flow at the measured
speed it demands.
In the wrong hands it could have been truly nauseating, an over-egged,
over-sweet pudding. But it is in the right hands and the result is a
Brief Encounter for our times in which the lovers get to go to bed
together.
The film opens with a will being read and the contents of a safe
deposit box being examined. Michael (Victor Slezak) and Carolyn (Annie
Corley) Johnson are horrified to discover how little they really know
about their late mother, Francesca (Streep). She wants to be cremated
and her ashes thrown off one of the bridges of the title, the celebrated
covered wooden bridges built by Rosemand and Holliwell in Madison
County, Iowa. Michael wonders whether it is even Christian and what
about the plot beside Father? Then they read the letter she has left for
them and her journals, discovering that years before she had had an
affair which was to prove the love of her life.
Their reactions -- Michael is hostile and outraged, Carolyn appalled
but sympathetic -- frame the central story which is told in flashback.
The device is extremely cunning because it gives the affair the right
bitter-sweet quality, shows us something of Francesca's family and
allows her children, both of whom are unhappily married, to learn from
their mother's life a lesson which helps them in their lives. Their
initial reactions modify subtly as they find out more about her until
they accept the affair for what it was -- real love. Without them, the
film would have been the poorer.
It is 1965. Francesca, an Italian GI bride, married for nearly 20
years to a farmer she met in Italy after the war, has been left alone on
the family farm for four days while her husband, Richard (Jim Haynie)
takes their children to the state fair. They have a good marriage, but
she is taken for granted by the family and pines for something she
cannot define.
Iowa is beautiful, but a long way from Italy and the society is
parochial in the extreme. Richard, the sort of man who believes a
woman's place is in the home, made her give up her career as a teacher
and, while she did so willingly, she regrets the lost stimulus.
Luxuriating in the pleasure of being on her own, she is interrupted by
Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for the National
Geographic magazine who needs directions to one of the covered bridges
which he has been assigned to photograph. Francesca, bored in the summer
heat, welcomes the diversion, offers to show the way, and discovers they
like the same things, know the same poets, share the same sense of
humour. Friendship blossoms and turns to passion. She tries to leave
with him when the four days are up, but cannot do so.
The heart of the film is the scenes between Robert and Francesca.
Eastwood creates a deeply sympathetic loner, a man of few words whose
beautifully observed silences are deeply eloquent. Streep magically
transforms herself into a dark-haired southern Italian, broad of hip,
bare of foot, full of bosom, who seethes with suppressed emotions. It is
a role Anna Magnani would once have played. Anyone who remembers
Streep's last role as an all-American, outdoor blonde Wasp Mom in the
action thriller River Wild will marvel at her range.
If there is a more heart-warming, life-affirming film between now and
Oscar time it will be a miracle. There is one hard-to-forgive decision,
however, of which Eastwood and Streep should be ashamed.
Francesca, her long-buried sexuality reawakened, looks at her naked
body in a mirror and dreams about making love with Robert. The use of a
body double is blatant and goes against everything the film is saying
about love being not only for the young.
Benjamin Ross's The Young Poisoner's Handbook, a hit at the Edinburgh
Film Festival, is a stylish black comedy based on the real-life Neasden
poisoner, Graham Young, who successfully practised his skills on his
disliked stepmother. When he turned them on his equally unloveable
father he was found out and sent to Broadmoor.
There he convinced a gullible psychiatrist (Anthony Sher) that he was
cured. Released, Graham was found a job in a factory where,
unfortunately, his favourite poison was used in manufacturing processes.
He resumed his trade, poisoning those on the staff he disliked, until
again found out and sent back to prison, Harshmoor in the film.
A tuppence-coloured affair, this highly promising directorial debut
mocks the mores of English working-class suburban life with skill, and
also puts the knife into psychiatrists who believe too much of what
their patients tell them, when what they are telling them is what they
want to hear, with stunning precision. Hugh O'Conor, splendid as the
appalling Graham, creates a misunderstood boy who, in other
circumstances, would have gone through life in an anorak, spotting
trains. Ross's trick is to make what Graham does funny, while forcing
the audience to share the horror he inflicts -- the stepmother may be a
bitch, but her messy, painful death is no laughing matter -- which is
very clever indeed.
Blue Juice, directed by Carl Prechzer, has one asset -- beautiful,
unfamiliar Cornish locations. The story about British surfers reaching
the dangerous age of 30 and having to face up to settling down is,
however, banal and there is nothing the players can do to improve
things.
Sean Peertwee, the leading thirtysomething, looks terrific until he
opens his mouth -- he has a mimsy little voice -- while Catherine Zeta
Jones, the love interest, is about as sexy as a wet bank holiday in
Millport.

DETECTIVES in Norfolk last night released without charge a man who was
arrested yesterday in connection with the death of Rachael Lean.
Ian Wells, 32, was being held at Cromer in Norfolk. He has been
released on bail.
Officers are still holding his former girlfriend, Maria Hnatiuk, 27,
who was arrested on Sunday.
Police were last night granted a further 36-hour extension to continue
questioning her.
Mr Wells, who is living with his mother Margaret in Taverham, near
Norwich, shared a cottage with Miss Hnatiuk in Lamas, close to Miss
Lean's home village of Buxton.
Mr Wells's father Roy, 66, died of a heart attack at his home on
Thursday when detectives arrived to question his son about Miss Lean.
Miss Lean was found stabbed to death on Sunday near RAF Coltishall, in
undergrowth close to her home.
Earlier yesterday, an inquest heard that she died from multiple stab
wounds and shock in the attack, which is thought to have happened on the
evening she disappeared.
Forensic experts identified the body by fingerprints. Police said
fingerprint identification was considered to be less traumatic for Miss
Lean's family.

Alan MacDermid reports from the British Association festival of
science in Newcastle
CROPS which light up in alarm when they are under attack by pests
could be growing in Scottish fields in three years.
Scientists at Edinburgh University have borrowed the genes from a
luminous jellyfish and inserted them into plants.
The glow they have produced so far is too dim to be seen by the naked
eye but has been confirmed using sensitive instruments and cameras, said
Professor Tony Trewavas, from the University's Institute of Cell and
Molecular Biology.
About one in a thousand crop seeds could be treated in this way and
distributed around a large field.
''Farmers are going to need ever larger fields to grow the food that
is going to be needed to keep pace with the population increase,'' he
said.
''I want to develop a plant I can hand to the farmer and tell him to
plant it, and he will be able to look out at night and spot which part
of his enormous field has a problem with fungus.''
This would save both in costs and in damage to the environment, said
Professor Trewavas. Currently farmers have to spray their crops either
pre-emptively, which is wasteful, or in response to visible signs of
attack, by which time it is usually widespread and requires spraying at
high concentrations.
Plants genetically altered with DNA from the jellyfish aequorea would
signal attack weeks before the development of visible disease symptoms,
he said.
The first plant to be lit up in Professor Trewavas's lab was, aptly,
an experimental tobacco plant, but the technique offered boundless other
possibilities ''if only I had the time to pursue them'', he said.
Water, for example, could be genetically engineered to glow when
levels of lead or other contaminants reached dangerous levels.
* It also emerged that designer tomatoes that fight cancer and apples
which stop tooth decay could ay be two of the fruits of new research by
genetic scientists.
Both could be made possible by tinkering with genetic codes to give
popular fruits and vegetables health-giving properties.
Scientists were told that tomatoes were already being developed that
contain extra carotenoids -- red and yellow vegetable pigments which
protect plants from oxidation damage and are thought to help prevent
cancer by doing the same in humans.
Dr Peter Bramley, of the School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway
College, Egham, Surrey, said that he had succeeded in inserting extra
copies of the carotenid genes into tomatoes.
The designer plants would contain much more carotenoid than could be
obtained simply by eating huge amounts of the right vegetables, he said.
In another development, biologists are trying to create plants with
built-in antibodies.
Antibodies are the complex proteins that form a key part of animals'
immune systems.
Inserted into the genetic make-up of plants, they could provide an
effective defence against plant diseases.
Dr Bill Cockburn, from the School of Biological Sciences at Leicester
University, said it might also be possible to incorporate antibodies
into fruit and vegetables which, when eaten, can protect humans.

MANDATORY testing for drugs in Scottish prisons will cost the taxpayer
hundreds of thousands of pounds, according to an Aids researcher.
The tests were announced by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth at the
end of last month.
Those who test positive will be punished, and Dr Sheila Gore, senior
statistician with the Medical Research Council's Biostatics unit, said
it would cost the public #60 for every day of remission each prisoner
lost, in most cases for smoking cannabis.
In England, mandatory testing showed that 36% of prisoners tested
positive, of whom 33% were for cannabis; the real figure, taking account
of tampering and substitution of urine samples, could be nearer 40%.
''If you test 50 guys every month and 20 are positive, most of that
will be for cannabis; it stays in the system for 14 days, as opposed to
three days for class A drugs like heroin,'' Dr Gore said. ''It costs
about #60 a day to keep someone in prison, and they could lose 14 days'
remission for smoking cannabis.''
On that basis, Dr Gore, a member of Aids prediction groups, calculated
that testing 50 prisoners each month would add #201,600 to the prison
bill.

<TEXT>
OPERATIONS to replace one of the tiniest bones in the human body, the
hammer in the middle ear, will take place next year using artificial
''smart'' bone grown in a British laboratory.
The material, called Hapex, has been licensedto Smith and
Nephew-Richards, a US subsidiary of the British-based Smith and Nephew,
for delicate ear operations.
Professor William Bonfield, director of the Interdisciplinary Research
Centre in London, said the replacement bone had been made from a
composite of hydroxyapatite, which forms the reinforcement in natural
bone.
Hapex could make a dramatic impact on hip bone replacement -- of the
40,000 carried out in the UK every year 18% are repeats with as many as
six taking place in the same joint because of wear. ''The synthetic
material deceives the natural bone into thinking it too is the real
thing, and prevents the process of resorption and loosening up which
takes place round a stainless steel or plastic implant,'' said Professor
Bonfield.

THE world's first sub-four-minute miler, Dr Roger Bannister, risked
the wrath of the politically correct by suggesting that there was
something physiologically different about black people that made them
better athletes. ''You only have to look at an all-black sprint final to
think that there is something there,'' said Dr Bannister, 66, chairman
of the Government committee on sport in universities.
''It may be an adaptation of muscles to life in hot climates, lack of
subcutaneous fatty insulation in the skin, or perhaps differences in the
length of the Achilles tendon,'' he said. Recently a US coach was sacked
for making a similar suggestion to Dr Bannister's.
* Strident attempts by the European Union to make people identify as
Europeans tend to put them off, said Dr Chris Stone, of London
University. But Dr Nick Hopkins, of Dundee University, said that the
Scots had their own separate identity from the English which made them
better Europeans.

LABOUR councillors came under pressure yesterday at least to delay the
transfer of water assets to the new water authorities.
One senior Strathclyde member appeared to be warming to the more
direct protest style of Militant Glasgow Councillor Tommy Sheridan, as
he contemplated the ''theft'' of public water and sewerage facilities.
Dr Christopher Mason, leader of Strathclyde's Liberal Democrats,
confessed: ''It's very easy to make emotive speeches about this. I've
heard some good ones from Tommy Sheridan, and I've no doubt I'll be
hearing some more. But I begin to wonder myself whether the balance of
argument doesn't shift his way.
''Because, if we go on making it easy for the Tories and their
henchmen to destroy the institutions of Scottish democracy, what is the
cause that we are ultimately serving?''
He pointed out that Strathclyde Regional Council had always tried to
comply with the law, even when it went against the grain of gut
political feeling.
While it was appalled by the poll tax, the council had tried to make
it work. The council was also trying to make local government
''disorganisation'' work.
''The whole process of disorganisation is only working because we, the
elected members, are making it work. The Scottish Office governs this
country through a compliant local authority system. And I sometimes
think we are committing the ultimate absurdity. We are obeying orders to
commit suicide.''
Questioned later, he said: ''There does come a point in the life of
any nation when you have to say 'This can't go on'. And I think the
Conservative and Unionist Party are pushing Scotland very close to that
point.''
For the SNP, Councillor Ian Mackay urged the council to take a
stronger line.
He asked: ''What are we going to do to stop them asset-stripping?
We've got to do something now. We've got to delay all the way.''
For the Labour administration, Councillor John Mullin, chair of
finance, said he had no difficulty in agreeing that the sub-committee on
local government reorganisation should look at the relationship between
Strathclyde's water services and the new water quango.
''We need to have a look at what powers we have left,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Jim Wallace MP, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats,
has asked the Scottish Affairs Select Committee to investigated the
Government's promotion of Build, Own and Operate schemes to finance new
public water and sewerage facilities.
He claimed independent research had shown that funding new projects
through BOO schemes would cost the Scottish people up to 50% more than
present funding arrangements through local authorities.

Moscow
UNIDENTIFIED attackers fired a rocket-propelled grenade through the
wall of the United States embassy in Moscow today but it slammed into a
photocopying machine and caused no injuries, the embassy said.
The assailants escaped and no motive was known for the attack, on the
eve of a visit by a top US official to tackle a bitter rift with
Washington over Nato air strikes in Bosnia.
Interfax news agency quoted Moscow's police chief as saying his forces
had been put on red alert after the attack, a measure last known to have
been employed in 1993 during a bloody riot by hardliners in Moscow.
The grenade penetrated the huge Stalin-era building on a busy Moscow
street but left few visible signs on the facade -- a small dent, several
smashed windows and a damaged window ledge.
''At 4.25pm (1225 GMT) today a rocket-propelled grenade impacted the
front of the old US embassy building on Novinsky Boulevard at the sixth
floor level. There were no injuries,'' said the embassy statement, read
out by telephone.
''The grenade penetrated the wall and was stopped by a large copying
machine.''
A grenade launcher, glove, black mask and a brown paper bag used to
carry the launcher were found in a courtyard opposite the embassy,
suggesting it was fired from there. Other reports suggested the grenade
was fired from a passing vehicle.
There was no immediate reaction from US President Bill Clinton or
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, although relations between their
countries are already uneasy because of Bosnia.
An embassy spokesman in Moscow told reporters: ''I think this has no
impact on Russian-American relations because this is an isolated
incident.''
Police sealed off the yellow and white embassy building, completed in
1953. All staff were evacuated.
Moscow police chief Nikolai Kulikov put his men on top alert, Interfax
said. A security source told the agency this empowered police to search
cars and apartments at will.
''There is no kidding with such things. This was an act of terror on
an international scale,'' Interfax quoted an official from an
unidentified secret service as saying.
The official said police had already put together an identikit of one
of the attackers.
''This was a young man in his 30s, Caucasian, taller than average. He
was dressed in light denim,'' he said.
Interfax quoted the FSB Federal Security Service as saying there was
no evidence to suggest the attack was carried out by Russian
nationalists or fighters from rebel Chechnya.
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Moscow police as saying the grenade was
fired from a car passing along the boulevard. But Interfax quoted FSB
officials as saying it was fired from the archway of an apartment block
across the street.
In Washington, White House officials said Clinton had been told of the
attack, on the eve of a visit to Moscow by US Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott.
Talbott hopes to calm Russia's anger and fears over Nato's air strikes
against Bosnian Serbs which have prompted a crisis in relations between
Moscow and the West.
The US embassy statement said there had been no warning calls and
security had been tightened at the mission.
Washington warned US citizens in St Petersburg last month to take care
over the next few weeks after its consulate in the city received a
report of possible attacks against Americans.
Russian law enforcement agencies dismissed the warning as a false
alarm but reacted to today's attack by tightening security at US
diplomatic missions on Russian soil.--Reuter.

Sarajevo
TENS of thousands of Serb refugees fled their homes in central and
western Bosnia today after Muslim and Croat forces captured key towns in
the area from Bosnian Serb troops, the United Nations said.
''It would appear that the town of Donji Vakuf has fallen,'' UN
special envoy Yasushi Akashi told reporters in Zagreb.
In another development which could not immediately be confirmed,
Croatian media in Zagreb said Croat forces had captured the strategic
town of Jajce.
Bosnian Serb sources said up to 6000 Serb soldiers were surrounded in
the vicinity of Donji Vakuf and Serb civilians said the town was under
serious threat.
Other UN officials were not immediately able to confirm the fall of
the town. The Bosnian Serb Army would not comment.
Up to 50,000 Serb civilians were fleeing after advances by allied
Croat and Bosnian government forces, international and local relief
workers said.
The civilians were leaving Jajce, Drvar, Mrkonjic Grad, Kljuc and
Donji Vakuf along the main road linking the northwest Bihac area to the
central government town of Zenica, they said.
Refugees were streaming towards Banja Luka, the last Serb bastion in
northwest Bosnia which is already crowded with up to 50,000 refugees
from the Serb Krajina enclave in Croatia, which the Croatians overran
last month.
The exodus jammed roads south of Banja Luka. It followed reports that
Croat and Muslim forces, backed by regular troops from Croatia, were
making major gains against Serbs in central and western Bosnia,
including the towns of Sipovo and Vozuca.
If confirmed, the fall of Donji Vakuf and Jajce would be a disaster
for the Bosnian Serb Army (BSA), already reeling from two weeks of air
strikes by Nato which have badly damaged its communications and missile
defences.
Bosnian government forces and their Croat allies have taken advantage
of Serb disarray to launch fresh offensives in central and northern
Bosnia and have made considerable gains.
Up to 8000 Serb refugees were reported to be trying to reach Jajce,
north of Donji Vakuf, before Zagreb media announced its fall.
''Croat forces have liberated the towns of Drvar, Sipovo and Jajce,''
the Croatian news agency Hina quoted Bosnian Croat military sources as
saying.
General Rupert Smith, UN military commander in Bosnia, pressed for no
let-up in the raids until the Bosnian Serbs removed their siege guns
from Sarajevo.
Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic has refused to withdraw
his guns and tanks.
But UN sources said more junior Serb commanders had been in touch with
peacekeepers seeking respite from the heaviest pummelling they have
suffered during 3[1/2] years of war.- Retuer.

Madrid
AN eleven-year-old boy was being looked after by friends today after
his mother was arrested for her alleged part in the murder of her bar
owner lover on the holiday island of Tenerife.
The mother, named as Jackie Ambler, a 31-year-old divorcee from
Doncaster, Yorkshire, was jailed on remand after her boyfriend, Michael
O'Hara, 39, from Wakefield, was found battered to death at Little
Stevie's Bar, which they jointly owned at Los Cristianos, a resort on
the island's south coast.
After his body was found eight days ago, police arrested Stanley
Stewart, 29, from Clackmannan, and Gary Holmes, 28, from Littlehampton,
Sussex.
Mrs Ambler, who called police to the murder scene at 4.30am, was
detained after lengthy questioning. All three today were in prison
facing murder charges.
Both men, employed in the resort as night club doormen, have allegedly
told police that they were paid by Mrs Ambler to kill her lover.
The judge handling the case has ordered a news blackout on the
investigation into the crime which has stunned the large British
community in the resort.
Mr O'Hara was, according to police, gagged, throttled with a gold
chain he was wearing and then battered with a metal beer barrel.

COLOMBO: SRI Lanka said bad weather was the likely cause of a military
plane crash near Colombo yesterday in which 75 people died but launched
an inquiry which would probe for possible sabotage.
Air Commodore Jayalath Weerakkody told a news conference that a Tamil
rebel missile attack, thought by some of his colleagues to have brought
down the Antonov-32 near Colombo, was the least likely cause of the
crash.
He said the pilot had reported an instrument problem after
encountering bad weather, minutes before the plane disappeared from the

THREE senior pupils at a leading Scottish private school have been
suspended amid a drugs investigation, it was disclosed yesterday.
The sixth formers from Loretto School in Musselburgh were said to have
been caught sniffing crushed sleeping pills at a recent school ceilidh
and disciplined after being reported by other pupils.
Two have been suspended for a week and the other for 10 days,
headmaster Mr Keith Budge said yesterday.
He said that the substance was not one on the ''banned'' list of
drugs, and that it was not Temazepam.
Speaking from the school, whose famous old boys include former
Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont and the late Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn, former MP for Perth and Kinross, Mr Budge said: ''Police have
not been involved. I have taken the view that this may have been a
matter of experimentation.
''Nevertheless, we take this seriously. We want to make a clear point
to pupils and strengthen their ability to say 'no' to drugs.''
Meanwhile, it was revealed that a police investigation is being
carried out into alleged drugs offences involving pupils at Eyemouth
High School in Berwickshire.
Borders Regional Council confirmed a total of 15 had been excluded
from the school but it is understood that most have now returned.
A spokesman at the school declined to comment. Police said a report
was being prepared for the procurator-fiscal.

<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of thousands of Scottish home owners are facing big repair
bills because of the hot summer.
The high temperatures caused bitumen felt in flat sections of tenement
roofs to blister and crack, allowing water to pour in during the recent
rainy spells.
Roofing companies have been inundated with calls from owners desperate
to have repairs carried out before the winter. Some could face bills of
up to #10,000 to repair the damage.
Mr David Alves, managing director of Edinburgh-based estate agents
Stewart Saunders, said: ''Anybody with bitumen felt on their roof would
be well advised to have it looked at.
''Virtually every traditional tenement in Scotland will have a flat
section of roof and could be affected. The problem will also affect
garages and extensions.''
Mr Alex Ballantyne, of Edinburgh-based Acorn Building Services,
warned: ''A lot of the problems have not come to light yet, because in
many cases the roof may have blistered but is still intact.
''But it only takes someone to go on the roof to replace tiles or fix
an aerial and the felt will crumble.''

THE Irish are refusing to throw in the towel in their efforts to
secure an industrial project that could create 3000 jobs.
Mossend in Lanarkshire is favourite to win the #750m European plant
planned by a Taiwanese TV and computer-tubes maker, Chung Hwa.
Sources in Dublin say that Scottish Enterprise is offering the company
-- part of the Tatung Group -- grant aid of around #90m, well above what
the Irish are prepared to pay.
But officials of the Irish Development Authority, with a formidable
record for attracting electronics investors such as Intel, Motorola,
Seagate, and Hewlett Packard, are refusing to accept that the project
has been lost.
''We have been negotiating with this company for some time and we are
still negotiating,'' said an agency spokesman in Dublin.
''We have heard all the speculation that the plant is likely to go to
Scotland, but our understanding is that a decision will not be made for
a number of weeks. So far as we are concerned there is everything still
to play for, and we'll be playing as hard as we can.''
The Irish are still smarting over the recent loss to the North of
England of a #1000m Siemens plant they believed was in the bag.

HUGH Grant has confessed to fantasising about the Princess of Wales
and dreaming about having tea with the Queen and meeting Mikhail
Gorbachev.
In an interview with Eva magazine, published yesterday, the Four
Weddings and a Funeral actor also described his long-time girlfriend,
Liz Hurley, as his ''dish of the day''.
''When she does magazine shoots they give her a different look every
time, so a new girl comes into the house each night.''
Grant, 35, said: ''I dream about Princess Di -- but it's too kinky to
go into.'' Of his dreams about the former Soviet leader, he said: ''I'd
go into a panic because I was meeting him but had nothing to wear.
''I'd ask my brother what to do and he'd tell me to wear my
dressing-gown. When I'd complain that mine was far too shabby, he'd tell
me to wear his as well.''
Asked to interpret the dreams without being told Grant's identity, Dr
Delia Cushway, a lecturer in clinical psychology at Birmingham
University, said his thoughts about the Princess might have a deeper
meaning.
She said: ''Sex dreams can be no more than wishful-thinking fantasies,
but they can also be a symbol for something else. Maybe he'd like to
move in higher circles.''

Brussels
THE European Commission yesterday proposed punishing banks which
overcharge customers transferring money across EU borders. A survey two
years ago showed that banks routinely kept 25% of the money sent in a
series of tests carried out by the European Commission. British banks
were among the worst offenders.
Since the test was carried out, the commission has reported no
improvement in the service by banks, and is now proposing a directive by
the end of this year. The issue will be put before the council of
ministers in Brussels on Monday.
EU commissioners believe overcharging is a brake on the efficient
working of the European single market. They are also concerned that
banks might charge even more heavily for money transfers when the
proposed European single currency is introduced. At present, foreign
exchange transactions are a source of rich pickings for banks all over
Europe.
A commission investigation monitored banks handling 1200 credit
transfers of Ecu 100 (#75). In all cases -- included some classified as
urgent -- the sender was instructed to bear all charges so that the
beneficiary could be credited with the full amount. The survey showed
that the banks charged an average of 25.4% made up mostly of sender
fees, but including foreign exchange margins and double charging.
British banks were not the worst at double charging, and were less
costly in that area than Greece, Ireland, and Spain. But at double
charging they were more expensive than their opposite numbers in
Portugal, Belgium, and Denmark.
British banks imposed the highest sender charges, followed by France
and Portugal. British banks are also among the most expensive on foreign
exchange margins, second only to Greece, and just ahead of Belgium.
The average total transfer cost for an urgent transaction involving
#80 was #15.29, compared with a non-urgent transaction costing #14.85.
In 36% of the urgent transfers, there was double charging.
Now the commission wants a tough law banning double-charging and
simplifying procedures. The time taken for a cross-border transfer will
be limited and there will be penalties for banks taking too long.
Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner for competition, told reporters the
law would end ''indefensible'' behaviour by banks.

SECONDARY headteachers were warned last night to be vigilant in the
face of a ''permanent revolution'' which Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth wants to impose on schools.
SNP leader Alex Salmond told the annual conference of the Head
Teachers' Association of Scotland in St Andrews that, despite the
''tartan trimmings and lucky white heather'' which Mr Forsyth wore for
the premiere of the film Braveheart, ''Believe me, from personal
experience, he is still a Klingon''.
He went on: ''His ambitions for Scottish education are still as
disruptive as they were when I was a student with him at St Andrews
University, when he was Education Minister, and now as Secretary of
State.''
In the strongest attack on Mr Forsyth since he became Secretary of
State, Mr Salmond said his political foe was determined for ideological
reasons to make Scottish schools more like English ones.
Mr Forsyth had, he said, mounted a three-pronged attack which
consisted of promoting opting out to fragment schools and Scotland's
local authority, integrated, comprehensive education system; constant
changes in schools which sapped teacher morale; and under-funding, which
struck at the heart of education.
Mr Salmond said it was ''a bit rich'' that the Prime Minister was
embarking on a full-blooded attempt to encourage all 25,000 local
authority schools in England and Wales to become self governing, when he
denied any form of self government to five million Scots.
He told the association, which represents two-thirds of Scottish
secondary heads, that he could understand why Mr Major was compelled to
make radical changes in English education because it had failed him.
But he could not understand what grievance or grouch caused Mr Forsyth
to contemplate a further period of permanent revolution to match what
was to take place in schools south of the Border.
''When we make changes we should build on our strengths, not undermine
or subvert them, which I think the process Mr Forsyth is engaged in is
designed to do,'' he added.

THE European Commission yesterday agreed a new aid package worth
#15.3m for the Highlands and Islands and other rural areas of Scotland.
After Scottish Office support is included as a condition of the grants
the total will be #40m, writes Murray Ritchie, European Editor.
The aid is separate from a series of packages agreed in 1993 for
Scotland under the EU's structural funding programme, which stretches to
the end of the century. This latest tranche of funding is part of a
package worth #35m in commission aid (#83m when British Government help
is included) for all Britain.
The new funding will be spent throughout the Highlands and Islands,
which is already in receipt of #300m worth of EU aid.
Most of the money will go on a series of initiatives including
business information centres and small rural businesses.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday invoked the ''double
whammy'' of the minimum wage and the ''tartan tax'' to claim that Scots
would be worse under Labour.
However, his attack came as Labour was holding a summit meeting to
discuss an autumn strategy to counter precisely such accusations, and
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson hit back afterwards.
He said: ''The so-called tartan tax is just one more Tory tax lie. For
the godfather of the poll tax and one of the architects of VAT on fuel
to pose as a friend of those on modest incomes is simply laughable.''
Mr Forsyth claimed a minimum wage would destroy jobs and said:
''People have a right to be told by the Labour Party the precise level
at which it proposes to set a minimum wage, so that the number of job
losses can be calculated.''
He pointed out that if the 3p in the pound income tax rise was invoked
by the Scottish parliament it would amount to ''discrimination against
Scotland's most economically vulnerable workers, whom Labour pretends to
champion''.
The Scottish Secretary asked whether the minimum wage would be set
higher north of the Border to allow for this tax. ''Labour must tell us
why those on higher incomes will pay the same tartan tax as those on low
incomes,'' he said.
But Mr Robertson said it was absurd for the Tories to claim to be
champions of progressive taxation when the opposite was the case.
''Michael Forsyth is putting his head on the block with this kind of
argument,'' he said.
''The Tories have imposed 20 new taxes since the last election.
''This makes them vulnerable and sensitive to the arguments, which is
why they are resorting to deceit.''
He said his party had held an excellent strategy meeting which had
agreed to tackle the taxation issue head-on over the autumn. They would
also campaign to explain to people the benefits of the additional member
system of proportional representation envisaged for the Scottish
parliament.
They would get across the fact that those elected from the lists based
on the country's eight European constituencies would be adopted openly
by party members and would be accountable to their electors, countering
Conservative claims that these would be ''party hacks'' decided on in
smoke-filled rooms.

<HEADLINE>Contract bids doomed if enterprise agency fails in eleventh-hour search for people willing to work abroad. #7m worth of overseas work at risk</HEADLINE>

FOREIGN contracts worth #7m are at risk unless an eleventh-hour trawl
for Scots prepared to go abroad is successful.
Scottish Development Overseas -- a newly founded wing of Scottish
Enterprise -- has been shortlisted by the European Union for numerous
projects, mostly in Eastern Europe, and including Russia.
But it has just three weeks to provide the names of people it would
sub-contract to do the work, or the bids will fall.
Mr Alan Dunn, SDO chief executive, said: ''We are in the process of
setting up a data base of Scottish expertise -- individuals, rather than
organisations.
''But we need people right now who are ready and willing to meet these
contracts, or the chance to win them -- after getting on the short leets
-- will be lost.''
SDO was formed three months ago to take advantage of aid agency
projects being funded by the EU, the World Bank, and African, Asian, and
US development organisations.
It was set up because many Scottish firms were unaware of the
opportunities for work, or were reluctant to risk, on average, #10,000
preparing provisional bids.
Swift successes in overcoming these hurdles have led to questions, now
being asked within Scottish Enterprise, as to why it was not founded at
least five years ago.
There are about six consultancy firms in the UK with up to 10 years'
experience in winning contracts funded by grants or loans to developing
countries. The 40-strong International Development (Ireland) is a
renowned expert in the field.
However, the three-strong SDO team is the only British bidder to have
been shortlisted for contracts in Brussels, the Czech Republic, Poland,
Romania, and Russia.
Under the rules, it now has three weeks to produce the CVs of people
who would do the work.
Most of the contracts involve providing technical assistance,
including project management and training, or embrace economic
development, environmental improvements, or restructuring business,
including tourism.
The #7m of projects will last between one and four years, and require:
* Four people with experience in restructuring businesses that employ
up to 5000 people to go to south-west Russia for two years.
* Five specialists -- in training, business development,
infrastructure, the food sector, and energy, including nuclear safety --
to set up project management units in Moscow.
* Five project analysts with financial backgrounds in setting up
businesses to go to Brussels on two-year contracts.
The SDO is also seeking up to 18 people for small to medium business
development programmes in Romania.
It is facing stiff competition for the work from EU and Scandinavian
countries, plus those associated with the World Bank.
For an agency charged with jobs creation and economic regeneration in
Scotland, one of the contracts would in fact involve imposing huge job
losses.
The south-west Russian project is aimed partly at restructuring
factories which were in the labour-intensive defence industry during the
Cold War.
The task is to whittle down some 75 separate organisations within the
sprawling plants to about 30 with the potential to be profitable.
Enterprise support centres are to be set up in Rostov, Krasnodar, and
Stavropol.
Mr Dunn said that salaries for some of the postings may not equal
those for similar work in the UK, but stressed that any deals would be
mutually acceptable to all parties.
Anyone sub-contracted would also receive payments via Scottish
Enterprise, designed to overcome any cash-flow problems associated with
contracts.
The agency has not ruled out secondments of its own staff in the
battle to win the contracts. It believes the projects will have spin-off
benefits, including export orders, by improving Scotland's image as a
provider of technical and advisory services.

psychiatric hospital was yesterday ordered to be struck from the
professional register.
Mr Peter Coulson, a 40-year-old married man, was held to have abused
the privileged nurse-patient relationship by forming and continuing the
relationship with the unnamed patient while employed at the Royal
Edinburgh Hospital.
But the professional conduct committee of the Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery, and Health Visiting held that a second charge
against Mr Coulson, alleging that he took part in ''a sexual activity''
with the woman, a single parent, had not been proved.
The committee members, sitting in Edinburgh, were told that Mr Coulson
admitted he had gone to bed with the woman in her flat with the
intention of having sex, but that an attempt at intercourse had proved
unsuccessful.
They reached their not proven decision on the charge involving ''a
sexual activity'' after considering legal advice.
Mr Coulson did not appear before the committee, and did not respond to
the charges by letter.
The committee heard the patient was admitted because of depression in
late 1991 and that Mr Coulson had taken an interest in counselling her,
but had continued the relationship after he transferred from her ward to
another section of the hospital and became involved with her socially.
Miss Heather Miller, a social worker at the hospital, told the
committee that, initially, she was very pleased when Mr Coulson took an
interest in the woman.
''I would have rated him as a very good psychiatric nurse. I had a
high regard for him,'' she said.
Mr David Laing, mental health operations manager for Edinburgh Health
Care Trust, who also gave evidence, said Mr Coulson, who was dismissed
from the hospital and did not appeal, should not have maintained any
counselling relationship with the patient on leaving her ward without
the involvement of her care team.

A RUGBY player enjoyed the thrills of the world's biggest
roller-coaster, not realising that he had broken his neck in a tackle
and his life was hanging by a thread.
Tristan Thornton, 18, also had two wisdom teeth pulled out and went
back to work for two days, where he shifted three tons of steel into a
store room.
When doctors later saw X-rays of the damage they immediately placed
him on a stretcher and strapped his head down, warning him that he could
have died instantly at any time.
They have now told Mr Thornton he must not play rugby again.
Mr Thornton, from Leeds, was playing left wing for the Leeds
Corinthians rugby union team in a friendly against Dinnington when his
head was jerked back in a tackle.
He shrugged off the pain, thinking he had pulled a muscle, picked
himself up and carried on playing for another 20 minutes, because his
team had no substitute.
Next day he hung out of the fast-moving Pepsi Max roller-coaster and
had a go on six other Blackpool fun rides.
He went to hospital only after five days of ''nagging'' by his mother,
who pleaded with him to have his neck examined at St James's Hospital,
Leeds.
Even then he went only because he wanted to be fit for a forthcoming
Yorkshire County trials match.
His mother said: ''Doctors said his life had been hanging by a thread.
We were gobsmacked. He was told that, had he moved his head in a certain
direction, or tried to make a sudden move with it, he could have been
paralysed or even instantly killed.
''He's been so lucky. He must have been in agony all week -- but he's
one of those typical 18-year-old men who wouldn't dream of admitting how
much pain he was in.''
Mr Thornton's fiancee, Michelle Kipling, 18, said: ''When the doctors
saw the X-rays they rushed to lay him on a stretcher and strap his head
down.
''He arrived at the hospital at 8pm, and by midnight they were putting
a full metal neck brace on him.''
Mr Thornton said: ''I was having a pretty bad game and, as I went in
for a tackle, this lad's knee came up and struck me on top of my head. I
got up and carried on playing.''
His step-father, Mr Graham Holmes, 43, said: ''Tristan is the strong,
silent type. He never shirks from tackling people twice his size.''
Doctors have banned Mr Thornton from playing rugby or any contact
sport again.
His mother added: ''He's already decided he's going to play again --
he's determined. He absolutely loves rugby and he'd won loads of
trophies. He was very good. If he doesn't play again he will be
devastated.''
Mr Thornton, who is still in hospital, will have to wear his neck
brace for about a month.

LOTTERY scratch cards are set for their own midweek TV show, in a bid
to emulate the huge success of BBC1's Saturday night lottery programme,
it was disclosed yesterday.
Noel Edmonds launched the first edition of the lottery show back in
November, and the TV personality and former DJ could be approached for
the new scratch card version.
But organisers are stressing that nothing is definite because the idea
is still in the early stages of development.
No date has been set for the launch, but it is expected to be a
midweek programme.
Larry Lamattina, head of All American Fremantle TV, said it would be
made for the BBC in collaboration with Camelot, which runs the national
lottery.
He said: ''The BBC will organise the programme and Camelot will fund
the prizes to sell lottery cards.
''The lottery show has been a huge success and we believe a scratch
card show could equal it.''
But the BBC said that the lottery scratch card show was simply a pilot
scheme in development and not a certainty at this stage.

THE Scottish Office has turned down a request by the Glasgow Central
Labour MP, Mr Mike Watson, for a public inquiry into the large number of
drug-related deaths in the city.
So far, more than 70 people have died through drug misuse this year.
Minister of State Lord James Douglas-Hamilton has written to the MP
stating that he saw no need for an inquiry, although he did very much
regret the heartache the deaths caused to families.
He also insisted that the Government was absolutely determined to do
all in its power to reduce the number of deaths.
Lord James revealed that the procurator-fiscal in Glasgow was now
ensuring that families of drug victims were fully informed about
circumstances surrounding the deaths.
Families were invited to meetings where they could discuss the
circumstances and ask questions, and a forensic pathologist was also
there to explain, in layman's terms, the findings of the post-mortem
examination.
Lord James also detailed the work of the Glasgow Drugs Crisis Centre
in helping addicts.

THE Scottish Office is ''likely'' to hold a public inquiry into the
compulsory property purchases necessary to build the proposed M74
motorway extension in Glasgow, it emerged yesterday.
The protest group, No M74, has claimed the possibility as a victory
for its campaign.
A letter from the Scottish Office industry department to one of the
group's members said: ''I can advise that because of the number of
objections lodged against the (compulsory purchase) order, a public
local inquiry looks likely to take place some time in the future.''
But a spokesman for the Scottish Office said it was not certain that
an inquiry would be held. He added that the letter referred only to the
compulsory purchase of property and not the road-building project as a
whole.
Mr Rab Fulton, a protester, claimed the pressure the group had exerted
had paid off. He added: ''Although it was a controversial approach, we
are confident that the high profile media attention we have attracted
has made the public sit up and take notice of the problems and adverse
effects of urban motorways.
''Whilst we would prefer the scrapping of the M74 proposals, we would
welcome the announcement of a public inquiry and urge the Scottish
Office to set a date immediately.''
The Scottish Office spokesman pointed out that it was mandatory to
hold a public inquiry where there were objections to compulsory
purchases, but said that attempts were still being made to resolve the
matter with official objectors.
Meanwhile protesters unfurled a 10ft ''No M74'' banner in Princes
Street, on the South Side of Glasgow, in opposition to plans to build a
slipway for the motorway near their homes in Rutherglen.
Mr Brian McNeill, of Princes Street, said: ''I don't want to open my
window in the morning and look at the motorway.
''I am told it will only cut 10 minutes off people's car journeys.
It's crazy.''
Mrs Mary Douglas, also of Princes Street, said: ''I don't let my
six-year-old son out at the moment because of the main road and nearby
railway.
''With a motorway it's going to be 10 times worse. I would be worrying
about him all the time.''
Mr Fulton was also among the Princes Street protesters opposing the
slipway.
He said: ''The area we live in is quite poor and there's a lot of
problems there anyway.
''It's also a low car ownership area and we are going to have to deal
with all the problems caused by pollution and heavy traffic.''
The protesters still hope to stop the road plan.
An initial inquiry will be held in Glasgow City Chambers on September
29. If the council opposes the project, a Scottish Office planning
investigation could then be triggered.

THE official unemployment total fell last month to its lowest level
for more than four years and Government statisticians have now
''revised'' the previous month's increase into a drop.
According to figures released yesterday, the UK total fell by 18,000
last month to 2,295,400 or 8.2% of the workforce, the lowest total since
May 1991. In Scotland, the figure dropped 800 to 198,000 -- 7.9%.
At the same time as publishing August's figures, the Central
Statistical Office said that July's figures had since been revised and
the previously reported increase of 1700 across the UK -- the first rise
in nearly two years -- was in fact a fall of 200.
Because of the revision, the official jobless total has now fallen for
24 months in a row.
Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch said the August figure
provided ''further confirmation'' of improvement in the performance of
the Scottish labour market.
''The level of seasonally adjusted unemployment (in Scotland) is below
200,000 for the third consecutive month and has not been lower at any
time in the last five years. The rate of unemployment has not been lower
in almost 15 years.
''This shows that very substantial progress has been made to reduce
unemployment in Scotland. It remains a central plank of Government
policy to provide business with the best possible conditions to succeed
and create jobs. This is clearly working in Scotland.''
But Labour's Scottish employment spokesman, Mr John McFall, described
the latest reduction as ''a miserable drop'' and ridiculed the revision
of the July total. ''Now the Government is becoming incompetent even at
fiddling figures.''
He observed that a recent opinion poll had shown that 20% of workers
in Scotland felt their future was insecure. ''With one in five employed
people feeling like that, there is little or no chance of the feel-good
factor coming back. What is needed is the departure of this Government,
so that ordinary people feel the possibility of a future for themselves
and their children.''
The Scottish National Party's employment spokesperson, Anne McNair,
said: ''These figures highlight the large number of people who are now
being failed by the system, fiddled out of benefits by Government
'adjustments' and offered little hope of re-entering the workforce,
given the appalling level of job creation under this Government.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said the jobless total
remained too high and blamed ''failed'' Government policies.
Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union
Congress, said the slight fall obscured the fact that there was a
significant slowing of economic growth.
''There is increasing evidence that what little growth there has been
in the economy has tended to be jobless. Many of those who have left the
dole queues have done so for short-term, low-paid employment. Others
have simply gone off the register into economic inactivity -- living on
the sick, or on the streets.''
Mr Lex Gold, director of the Confederation of British Industry in
Scotland, said: ''The economy is in reasonable shape and it seems that
July's rise represented a blip, perhaps a statistical one. But we need
to continue to strive to create the conditions for businesses to grow,
prosper, and create jobs and wealth. For individuals, the key is
enhanced education and skills.''
Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard said recovery in
the labour market was continuing at a ''sustainable rate''. Unemployment
was down by nearly 300,000 over the last year and by more than 680,000
since the recovery had begun. The UK unemployment rate was nearly two
percentage points below the European Union average.
''Many opportunities are available for people seeking jobs. Last month
the numbers placed in jobs by Jobcentres were the highest ever,'' she
said.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB union, said it was
''most curious'' that the July figure had been revised down, adding that
the move cast more doubt on the validity of the Government's statistics.
* Almost 3000 Royal Air Force jobs were cut yesterday.
The 2992 posts -- 86 of them compulsory redundancies -- are the first
phase of 8600 losses announced last December as a result of the Front
Line First review. It is planned to reduce the size of the RAF workforce
to 52,500 by the turn of the century from a high of 89,000 five years
ago.

THE Labour Party hierarchy yesterday rebuked constitutional spokesman
Dr Kim Howells over remarks he made about devolution.
A spokesman for party leader Tony Blair's office said: ''The office
has been in touch with Dr Howells. He was told that the position in
terms of the Welsh assembly and the Scottish parliament was as Tony
Blair set out in an interview and Jack Straw (Shadow Home Secretary)
reiterated yesterday.
''He said he recognised some of his remarks were open to
misinterpretation, but that he is fully supportive of Labour Party
policy. As far as Mr Blair is concerned, that is the end of the
matter.''
Dr Howells, the MP for Pontypridd, caused controversy when he told The
Herald on Monday that change was more of an issue for the chattering
classes than on the doorsteps, equated nationalism with fascism, and
expressed doubt on whether enthusiasm for constitutional change would
survive beyond a General Election victory for Labour.
He said yesterday he would not be resigning and that he was absolutely
behind Labour's policy on devolution. ''I have been given a job to do
and, until it is made clear that I am not able to do it, then I will
continue to do my best,'' he said.
''I was part of the working party that planned the thing. It was quite
a battle, and I am not going to denounce that now.''

THE world of politics is full of sharks, but yesterday the humble
goldfish took centre stage.
The launch of a Liberal Democrat document on Investing in People,
Cleaning up Politics, and Building the Future became somewhat
overshadowed by the strange tale of Mr John Major's goldfish.
The Prime Minister, Labour leader Tony Blair, and Mr Paddy Ashdown
were filmed sharing a joke during a break in VJ Day proceedings at
Horseguards Parade, London, last month.
There was much speculation as to what prompted their good humour, and
yesterday it emerged that the subject of their discussion was the Prime
Minister's pet goldfish.
Expert medical attention was needed when the fish, which lives in a
pond in the garden of Mr Major's Huntingdon home, was diagnosed as
having sun-stroke. It had to be plucked from its watery home and an
attempt was made to revive it.
Mr Ashdown told a Westminster news conference: ''I hope I am not
breaching Cabinet confidentiality, but the Prime Minister gave us a very
engaging description about his goldfish. It had sun-stroke over the
holidays and had to be taken out . . . and given some sun cream.''
Asked if Mr Major's concept of first aid worked, he said: ''I don't
know, you will have to ask at Number 10.'' However, Downing Street
declined to enlarge on the emergency, and it remained unclear if the
fish came through its difficulties.
Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats' document almost broke new ground at
Westminster, and raised a number of eyebrows with its glossy
presentation and 32 pages of glaring black, yellow, and white
declarations of policy, complete with an enormous Paddy Ashdown
signature covering almost one-and-a-half pages.
Mr Ashdown says in his introduction that the document does more than
just set out the hopes of the Liberal Democrats for the country, it
makes ''concrete commitments about what the Liberal Democrats will do''.
He adds: ''In common with our past practice, all of the policies set
out in the Liberal Democrat guarantee will be part of our fully costed
manifesto for the General Election.''
The document takes two full pages to say the following: ''The Liberal
Democrats exist to build and safeguard a fair, free, and open society,
in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality,
and community, and in which no-one shall be enslaved by poverty,
ignorance, and conformity.''
It is argued that if things stay as they are, Britain will continue to
fail, and that if the country is to succeed it must change. The Liberal
Democrats would guarantee the change Britain needs.
Central to much of this, of course, is constitutional reform, with
revitalisation of local government, establishment of democratic
parliaments in Scotland and Wales, and devolution of power to ''regions
and communities of Britain''.
The party wants fair tax, not high tax, stating it will make Britain's
tax system fairer and ensure that people contribute according to their
ability to pay.
There are also pledges to introduce a Bill of Rights, a written
constitution, and effective legislation to stop discrimination, together
with a guarantee to end government secrecy through a Freedom of
Information Act, and to give people more say in local decision-making
through the use of ''advisory referendums''.
On education, one of the ''hot'' issues of the moment, the party
repeats its pledge to invest an extra #2000m, and to ask people to pay
an extra penny on income tax to fund this investment, if it proves
necessary.
Scottish leader Jim Wallace, MP for Orkney and Shetland, said the
document explained the positive case for voting Liberal Democrat, and
would be at the centre of the party's campaigning between now and the
next election.
He said: ''A Scottish parliament is at the heart of our plans for
improving government in Scotland and releasing the energies of the
Scottish people.''

TREASURY Chief Secretary William Waldegrave yesterday sent shock waves
through the Civil Service, writes Stephen McGregor, when he made clear
that further Whitehall job losses could be on the way to make room for
tax and spending cuts in the build-up to the next General Election.
He said he believed there were savings to be made in the short term,
adding: ''We already have the smallest Civil Service since the war, but
we have to continue the pressure. I know there is much more that can be
done.
''I believe the Civil Service recognise they have to have the same
kind of pressures on them as the private sector.''
Mr Waldegrave, in charge of capping departmental budgets, said any tax
cuts had to be well-founded and not just temporary vote-winning gimmicks
if the economy was to succeed.
''I do not think the electorate would be at all impressed, nor would
the economists, nor would the markets, and nor would it be the right
thing to do, if they thought tax cuts were were going to be simply a
gimmick and reversed,'' he told BBC Radio.
He said there would be room for further spending cuts, which would be
needed to ensure taxes were ''well based.''
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke had taken #45bn off spending plans in the
last three years, and there were no easy options, but Mr Waldegrave
added: ''No-one is going to convince me, nor I think the electorate,
that out of a total spending budget of #300bn we cannot find savings.''
Labour leader Tony Blair meanwhile gave the clearest signal yet that
he wanted his party to be seen as a tax-cutting party.
He refused to spell out tax strategy but insisted there were no plans
to bring in a 50% top rate of income tax at the #60,000-a-year level.
''I want people to be better off under Labour,'' he told the Jimmy
Young programme. ''The principle is this -- if you can get the tax
burden down for ordinary families, consistent with the state of the
economy and the proper funding of public services, fine.
''Everyone wants to see the huge tax hike the Conservatives have put
on reduced, but it has to be consistent with the state of the country's
economy. The people of this country have had the largest tax increase in
history -- almost #1000 a year the average family in Britain is paying
in tax under the Conservatives.
''The last thing they want to hear from the Labour Party and the last
thing I want to do is add to the burden of average families by putting
up their taxes again.''
Mr Blair stood firm against the critics in his own party and insisted
most members backed his reforms. Referring to the controversial leaked
strategy document, he said he agreed with some of the ideas it
contained, but not with others. He said: ''Advisers advise, but leaders
lead in the end.''

THE SNP claimed yesterday that recruitment irregularities on the new
East Ayrshire unitary authority, which had forced it to complain to the
Local Government Staff Commission, were just the tip of the iceberg in
terms of Labour running councils for its own ends.
Although the row involves four relatively junior appointments -- of
secretarial staff to support councillors -- the SNP claimed that
''Labour was driving a coach and horses through good practice
guidelines''.
The SNP, which forms the opposition on the council, described as
''appalling malpractice'' the flouting of recruitment policy and
withholding of background papers from SNP councillors.
The party claims that changing the system of three secretaries for the
administration and one for the opposition to that of a shared pool of
four would leave it open to breaches of confidentiality. There were also
claims of nepotism in the appointments procedure.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said last night:
''We would not defend anybody who broke guidelines, but this seems to be
a narrow and parochial point about junior appointments.''
Councillor Maureen Watt, SNP vice convener for local government, said
the SNP was not prepared to let the ''rotten ways'' of the Labour Party
taint the new councils before their work had even started.

THE family of a five-year-old boy yesterday won their fight to have
him re-admitted to school, nine days after he was expelled for allegedly
talking too much.
Staff at Trinity Primary School, Edinburgh, say Shaun Murray will
receive constant one-to-one supervision to stop him causing disruption
to fellow pupils.
The boy, who is said to suffer from a lack of concentration and
behavioural problems, was asked to leave the school after teachers said
his chattering and refusal to sit in his seat was affecting the
education of his class mates.
The boy's father Mr Steven Murray, said the school could not cope with
his son's ''disruptive behaviour''.
He claimed that the school had been informed by one of Lothian
Regional Council education department's own child psychologists that his
son had problems and would need an auxiliary teacher to sit with him.
However after the school reversed its decision yesterday, Mr Murray
said: ''Shaun is going back to school and that's the main thing. I'm not
going to hold any grudges against the teachers.''
Mr Colin Dalrymple of Lothian region said: ''We are delighted Shaun is
coming back to school.
''Staff already employed within Trinity will take turns to sit in his
class with him and assist when needed.
''His behaviour will also be continually monitored and we will meet
his dad at regular intervals to discuss how the boy is progressing.''

ARMED police swooped on two men in central London yesterday after a
member of the public mistook their car phone for a handgun.
Onlookers saw the men being pulled from their car at gun-point, forced
to lie face down on the road, then being trussed up and marched into a
police van.
But a Scotland Yard spokesman defended the operation as standard
procedure and insisted police could not afford to take risks with
reports of guns.
Witness Suzanne Pugh saw the swoop on a Ford Scorpio outside the
Dorchester Hotel, near Hyde Park, at 2.30pm from her office window.
She said: ''The police pulled them out and spread-eagled them on the
ground. They had four large automatic weapons pointing at one of them.
''It was extraordinary to see that sort of firearms capability in the
centre of London.
''They put plastic wire around the wrists and legs of one of the guys
and took them off into a van, then cordoned off the street.
''It was obviously quite frightening for the staff here, and I would
have thought the men would be shaken, but they were laughing and joking
when they got out of the van, and they just went back to sitting in
their car.
''I heard later that someone had mistaken their mobile for a pistol.''
A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ''This is standard procedure if
somebody rings up with a report of a gun. Our officers would err on the
side of caution.''
A Police Complaints Authority spokesman said no complaint had been
received over the incident, he added: ''We have had complaints over this
sort of incident, usually where police are conducting a search of a
house and have got the wrong address or are given wrong information. I
couldn't say whether this sort of incident is on the increase.
''We would check what information they had and ask whether the action
they took was correct. If guns were drawn, we would want to know why.
''The number of times when firearms are deployed has gone up
inexorably because of the inexorable rise in the number of people using
guns.''
Senior officers have authorised the issuing of firearms increasingly
often over the last decade, with 1993 seeing almost twice the 2667
issues of 1984.

JEREMY Brett, best known for the part of Sherlock Holmes in the ITV
series, has died of heart failure at the age of 59, Granada Television
said yesterday.
Mr Brett, who suffered heart problems last year, died in his sleep at
his London home early on Tuesday.
His portrayal of Holmes was regarded as one of the finest. Actor
Edward Hardwicke, who played Holmes's partner Dr Watson in the series,
said: ''I am totally saddened by Jeremy's death. He was a great friend
and a really remarkable actor.''
Mr Brett's television career masked tragedy in his personal life. He
nearly died of a heart disorder last year while working on the series,
and suffered a mental breakdown after the death of his wife Joanie from
cancer in 1986.
He said last year: ''Actually, I should be celebrating because this is
my last outing as the Baker Street sleuth. Having played Holmes in what
will now be 42 television films, I felt I'd exhausted the character. But
he turned the tables on me.''
He also managed to overcome the bouts of depression which followed his
wife's death, and was able to joke that since he started playing Holmes
in 1983 his hair had been constantly dyed black. ''Now I'm beginning to
see what I really look like -- a rather distinguished, albeit ageing,
badger.''
He said of Holmes: ''The trouble is, Doyle (Sir Arthur Conan) gave him
brains galore and only the sensibility of an eight-year-old. Children
can take Sherlock at face value and understand him. But what really
makes him tick is as much a problem for adult audiences to understand as
it has been for me playing him.''
The actor's last public words were heard 10 days ago by listeners to
BBC Radio 4, when he made an appeal on behalf of the Manic Depression
Society.
He spoke about his life with the condition and how he adapted to
coping with violent mood swings.
Many Holmes fans felt Mr Brett portrayed the most convincing version
of the detective.
Mr Phillip Weller, a senior official of the Franco-Midland Hardware
Co, a society which gets its name from a Holmes story, said Mr Brett
''developed the part enormously''.
''His portrayal has set a new standard by which all subsequent
performances will have to be judged,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Scotland lags in nursing pay deals despite union claims</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH NHS trusts are failing to award full pay deals to all nurses,
despite union claims that the struggle to achieve 3%, no-strings
attached awards in the rest of the UK is all but over.
The Royal College of Nursing yesterday celebrated reaching a UK
landmark of 300 no-strings local pay deals with 486 trusts, the
equivalent of 62%.
But the picture in Scotland is far gloomier. Only 15 trusts out of 47
(32%) have agreed to the full pay demand.
RCN officials said hospitals north of the Border may be lagging behind
because of a lack of experience running trusts. The union represents
around 30,000 members in Scotland.
Mr Alex McMahon, RCN service development manager, said: ''Most of the
Scottish trusts are new, whereas many in England have been going for
years and are more familiar with business planning.''
He suggested that newer Scottish trusts could be more cautious when
setting budgets and could look for large-scale savings, such as labour
costs.
But Mr McMahon added that the situation was improving, with more
nursing staff being offered the full no-strings offer in recent weeks.
Ms Anne Thomson, the union's Glasgow and Western isles officer, said
recent revised offers at the seven hospitals in her area were a ''vast
improvement'' on earlier deals.
She added: ''Most people have come back to us with revised offers, but
it is disappointing that some others haven't. The Victoria Infirmary in
Glasgow, for instance, has not added to its 1% offer.''
Unions threatened industrial action over the concept of local pay
deals. When negotiations began at the beginning of the year, the RCN
announced it would achieve victory over the plan by getting 300 of the
NHS trusts to accept a minimum 3% deal, which they claimed would
effectively be a national agreement. But Scottish trusts have
consistently lagged behind the rest of the UK in making improved pay
offers.
Earlier this month a deal was struck to avert industrial action
involving other unions. It was agreed that a national minimum wage
structure would be established with additional payments negotiated at a
local level.
The Department of Health and health trusts last night welcomed the
300th deal.
A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ''We have always said
local pay is fair pay and the RCN's announcement bears this out.''
Meanwhile, hospital trust managers last night booed and heckled Shadow
Health Secretary Margaret Beckett as she warned that Government policies
were privatising the National Health Service and vowed to tear up the
NHS reforms.
In an uncompromising speech, she said she believed there was no longer
a National Health Service.
Furious trust chairmen and chief executives accused her of failing to
recognise the benefits of the reforms and denied they were part of any
privatisation.
Mr Rodney Walker, chairman of the NHS Trust Federation, said
afterwards: ''I don't believe anyone in this room feels part of the
invidious process of privatisation. I think we all believe we are part
of one National Health Service.''
In her address to the federation's annual conference, Mrs Beckett
repeated Labour's new health policy, unveiled earlier this summer.
Its proposals include plans to take away the assets of trust hospitals
and make them more accountable by putting local councillors on their
boards.
However Mrs Beckett made no attempt to win over trust chiefs or
recognise the achievements of doctors, nurses, and managers in improving
patient care.
She told the Nottingham conference that under Labour, hospitals would
be concerned with winning patients not with winning orders. Unlike under
the Tories, there would be no private finance for capital projects and a
commission would be set up to examine the problems of long-term care.
''The choice the public will face in the next election is the choice
of a stealthy privatisation of the service under the present Government,
or a modern health service under Labour,'' Mrs Beckett said.
Trusts were structured in such a way that they could be privatised at
the stroke of a pen, she said.
Speaking to journalists after her speech, Mrs Beckett said she had no
regrets over what was said. She added it was important for trust
managers to know exactly where she stood.
''I don't believe the structures put in place will allow for the
continuation of a National Health Service, let alone its modernisation
which most people would wish to see.''

AN ambitious #6.4m project to transform a nineteenth-century
Coatbridge school into a 21st-century showcase for the Scottish film
industry has been shortlisted for a Millennium Fund award.
The proposal for the creation of a centre to celebrate cinema -- past,
present, and future -- will combine a museum of cine-memorabilia, a
conventional picture house, and a state-of-the-art cinema dynamique in
which hydraulic power is used to move the audience's seats in tandem
with the action on the screen.
If the bid, prepared by a partnership involving Monklands district,
Strathclyde region, the Scottish Film Council, and Summerlee Heritage
Trust, is successful then the centre will be housed in the former
Gartsherrie Academy.
The Millennium Fund has been asked to provide #2.9m towards the total
capital budget. A decision is expected to be announced early in the new
year.
The project would allow a unique collection of movie memorabilia,
collected over 20 years by the Scottish Film Archive, to be put on
display for the first time. The planned 208-seater cinema will screen
mainstream movies in the evenings and archive material (accompanied by a
restored cinema organ) during the day.
The 36-seat ''moving-experience'' cinema involves special laser
projection together with a hi-tech, eight-track sound system. It is
believed the centre could attract more than 140,000 visitors a year.
Project director Gwyn Kennedy said: ''Scotland and the industry
deserve a centre such as this within an hour's drive for 75% of the
population.''

<TEXT>
A JUDGE is expected to impose a ''stinging'' six-figure fine today on
a power company that took nine hours to shut down a nuclear reactor
after an accident.
Mr Justice Morland retired overnight before delivering his sentence on
Nuclear Electric at Mold Crown Court after warning that the public would
expect it to receive an ''exemplary'' punishment.
Nuclear Electric pled guilty on Tuesday to four charges under the
Health and Safety at Work Act relating to an incident at Wylfa nuclear
power station in Anglesey, North Wales, on July 31, 1993.
A faulty weld caused a ''parasol grab'' weight to fall into the core
of the reactor down one of the 6156 fuelling channels.
Officials were accused by the HSE, which brought the prosecution, of
having their ''brains in neutral'' and putting money before safety.
The chief of Britain's Nuclear Inspectorate, Dr Sam Harbison, said in
a statement to the court that the events were potentially the most
serious in the UK during his time as chief inspector.
But the court was told yesterday that there had been no risk of
reactor ''meltdown'' and that the possible consequences were never worse
than a ''clad melt'' within a single channel.
Staff could have been exposed to radiation and food restrictions might
have been imposed within a kilometre of the plant.
Mr Robert Owen, QC, defending, said the company had failed to
stipulate in its station operating instructions that the reactor should
be shut down if it was suspected that an item with the potential of
blocking a channel had been released into the core.
''The company was at fault in the manner in which its staff were
instructed to apply this operating rule,'' he said.
However, Mr Owen added: ''Nuclear Electric emphatically refutes that
there was any question of commercial considerations taking any part in
the decision to shut down the reactor or, once the decision had been
made, to defer that time of shut down.''
The judge agreed that none of the people who decided not to trip the
reactor were individually to blame.
''This is a clear case of the company as a company being culpable
rather than the finger being pointed at any individual or group,'' he
said.
He said Nuclear Electric was a ''very substantial'' organisation and
the offences related to a failure of safety management.
He added: ''The penalty, bearing in mind the public's concern, has to
be very substantial and has at least to sting. Certainly at present I am
of the view that it really must be a six-figure sum.''

CULT horror videos have prompted children as young as 10 to use a
cemetery as a sick playground, accoring to a Kirk minister.
The Rev Morag MacDonald has seen children knocking over headstones,
smashing pieces off them, and wrecking floral tributes late at night in
her local graveyard.
Gangs of teenagers regularly hold Buckfast wine binges and career
around on motorcycles in Cambusnethan Cemetery, Wishaw. The damage is so
bad that the local council is thinking about erecting an electric fence
around the cemetery.
Ms MacDonald, of Cambusnethan North Parish Church, said: ''Primary
children are desecrating the graves not only of long ago but of very
recent burials.
''That is soul-destroying for the relatives. I try to comfort them
after the grave they have tended is wrecked.
''The children are not frightened at playing in a graveyard. They go
there to re-enact the videos they see -- like Hallowe'en and others.
It's very sad, because their parents don't know or care what they do.
''Older youths go there to take drugs and drink Buckie.''
The Rev Ian Murdoch, minister of the neighbouring Cambusnethan Old
Parish Church, said some of his elderly parishioners did not want to be
buried in the cemetery, even though relatives have been interred there.
However, he does not believe an electric fence would be workable. He
said: ''Efforts should be directed at finding out why so many youths
congregate here. There are five off-sales shops within a few hundred
yards of the graveyard. There is no doubt there are a lack of jobs and
things for young people to do.''
Cemetery staff are dismayed by the damage, which includes 83 out of
100 young trees torn up by the roots or snapped in two. Workers are
continually clearing up broken drink bottles.
The council has called for regular reports on the wrecking and is
considering the electric fence option.

OFFICIALS have admitted that five men went missing from Friarton
prison, Perth, in two separate escapes, instead of the three originally
announced.
Roseanna Cunningham, SNP MP for Perth and Kinross, has called for an
inquiry after a prison spokesman yesterday confirmed that another two
prisoners had absconded from a working party on Friday afternoon.
Rodger Gillespie, 25, and John McGee, 23, walked away from a nursery
in Fife where they were working without supervision.
Gillespie was serving a three-year sentence for a range of offences
and McGee had been sentenced to 18 months for housebreaking.
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said: ''Two prisoners absconded
from a small nursery in Fife on Friday afternoon.
''An investigation has been launched into the incident. If that
investigation concludes that procedures need to change, they will be
changed.''
Later that evening, another three prisoners escaped from the ''medium
security'' prison.
It is believed that the men climbed out their cell windows and scaled
the perimeter fence.
One of the escaped men, a rapist, was recaptured on Saturday.
But Ronald Stewart, 33, who was serving six years for three offences
including assault, and John Byrne, 26, who was sentenced to 21 months
for a range of offences, are still on the run.
Last night, the Scottish Prison Service spokesman defended the
decision not to announce that the two other prisoners had absconded.
He added: ''The two prisoners who absconded are low security, category
D prisoners. We did not announce that they were missing on Friday
because we judged that they posed no danger to the public.
''Each case is looked at on its merits. These prisoners were both low
security prisoners.''
But yesterday Ms Cunningham demanded an investigation into security at
Friarton.
She said: ''A remarkably high number of prisoners have absconded from
Friarton prison in the last year.
''Given this latest information, an urgent review of staffing levels
is obviously required.''

YOUNG farmers' leaders in Orkney refused last night to reveal the
outcome of investigations into claims of cheating at a stock-judging
contest.
The controversy concerned allegations that the winning team had been
given inside information by one of the judges.
About 20 officials and representatives of the four Orkney clubs --
Harray, Sandwick, Deerness, and East Mainland -- met behind closed doors
at Kirkwall to look into the allegations and question the judge.
After two hours, Mr Derek Tait, Orkney district association of young
farmers' club chairman, made a brief statement which said the situation
had now been rectified.
The statement added: ''All four clubs are satisfied that the matter is
now closed.''
Mr Tait would not elaborate.

THE Serious Fraud Office was accused of bowing to political pressure
yesterday after announcing it will not seek to extradite Mr Nick Leeson
for trial in Britain over the #860m collapse of Barings Bank.
Mr Leeson's lawyer, Mr Stephen Pollard, said: ''It has all the

''Instead, it is keen to have him sent to Singapore to face lesser
charges.
''It makes no sense, unless there is a non-legal explanation and it is
coming under political pressure to resist his extradition here.''
He pledged in a statement: ''We will battle to overturn this
irrational decision and also to defeat the Singaporean extradition
request in Germany.''
Mr Leeson admitted offences of false accounting and obtaining property
by deception -- carrying maximum sentences of seven and 10 years -- in
six days of interviews with the SFO in Frankfurt jail earlier this
month.
But the SFO said in a statement: ''The interview did not substantially
add to the information already discovered in the course of earlier
investigations.
''Having carefully considered the matter, the SFO has not altered its
view that Singapore remains the principal jurisdiction for a criminal
prosecution, not withstanding Mr Leeson's stated wish to be tried in the
UK.''
The SFO decision brings Mr Leeson closer to the spectre of a no-jury
trial in Singapore, and a sentence of up to 14 years in the notorious
Changi jail.
Singapore's request to extradite him on 12 offences of forgery and
cheating will be decided by a regional court in Frankfurt in late
September or early October.
An SFO spokeswoman said: ''We would strongly deny that any political
pressure has been put on us.''
She added that it would reconsider its position on extradition if
Singapore's request failed.
Mr Pollard has said that if the Frankfurt court approved the
application they would take the case to the Federal Constitutional
Court, which he claimed could delay proceedings until well into 1996.
''(Leeson's wife) Lisa and the rest of Nick's family are
understandably upset. They will, of course, continue the fight, as will
all those who have supported Nick Leeson,'' he said.
Mrs Leeson was expected to fly to Germany last night or this morning
for her weekly hour-long visit with her husband. Mr Pollard said she
would make no separate statement.
It appears likely that Mr Leeson will not learn of the SFO decision
until his wife visits him. Mr Pollard said the trader was not allowed to
make telephone calls from prison, so he had not been able to speak to
him.

William Tinning reviews the campaign timetable which helped keep the
West Highland train on track
THE first hint of the tough and at times acrimonious battle to save
the West Highland sleeper began in earnest this year.
The warning signals had been posted earlier, however, soon after
former British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid admitted that the future of
the sleeper was under review because of the effects of a damaging signal
workers' strike.
It was a report in The Herald last April which disclosed that ScotRail
planned to run so-called ghost trains.
Sir Bob's announcement in August last year of the London-Scotland
sleepers review was followed some three months later by an admission by
Mr Roger Salmon, BR's director of passenger rail franchising, that he
could not guarantee future sleeper services for budgetary reasons.
On December 14 Mr Salmon confirmed he was excluding the Fort William
and West Country cross-Border sleeper services from the minimum service
levels required of train operators under rail privatisation.
By January 1 this year, the signs became more ominous for the West
Highland sleeper, when BR confirmed that Edinburgh-based Motorail
services, which operated ''piggy-back'' on sleeper services, would cease
from the end of May.
In the same month ScotRail's director, Mr Chris Green, warned that
Government demands for budget cuts were threatening the quality of
ScotRail services.
Mr Green also claimed there was little chance of retaining the Fort
William sleeper service because it would need more than #3m subsidy a
year.
Liberal Democrat MPs and the Rail Users' Consultative Committee
stepped in at the beginning of February.Days later, the then Transport
Secretary, Dr Brian Mawhinney, claimed it was costing the public #540
per passenger, including #360 in infrastructure costs, to keep the West
Highland sleeper running.
Matters reached a head on February 10 when The Herald revealed that
even the editors of Hansard were found to have missed out key words
uttered by Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro when the Scottish
Grand Committee was discussing the Government's commitment to full,
public consultation on rail services.
The following month Mr Green resigned in protest at attempts by BR to
''gag'' him after he criticised proposed ScotRail cuts.
The formal announcement of the withdrawal of the West Highland sleeper
and Motorail services was made on March 14.
The saga took a new twist the following day when the Convention of
Scottish Local Authorities prepared to take the Government to court over
the withdrawal of services.
It also emerged that the then Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, had not
been notified of the announcement, despite BR claims that it had
consulted the Scottish Office.
Highland Regional Council gave notice on April 11 that it would seek
legal opinion following The Herald's ''ghost train'' report.
The local authority duly launched a legal challenge two weeks later in
the Court of Session alleging that ScotRail's closure decision of the
West Highland sleeper service was ''illegal, irrational, and
unreasonable'' and amounted to a ''sham''.
The Herald disclosed that a report by Edinburgh-based rail consultants
Pieda stated that the subsidy per sleeper passenger was in fact #70, a
figure similar to subsidies paid to many rural lines in England and
Wales.
On May 9, Lord Kirkwood in the Court of Session upheld Highland
Regional Council's legal challenge and granted an interim interdict on
closure.
His judgment was that the withdrawal of the sleeper would amount to a
proposal to discontinue all the railway passenger services on three
sections of line in Strathclyde under the terms of the Railways Act
1993.
On June 7, BR's appeal against the ruling was rejected.
Nine days later the British Railways Board finally bowed to the weight
of Scottish popular and political pressure by conceding that two court
rulings had ensured a reprieve, until the end of the summer at least.
In July, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth intervened, and this
appears to have set the scene for a U-turn on the future of rail
services north of the Border.

TWENTY-FIVE years after Dunoon's last brush with rock megastardom,
courtesy of a concert by Pink Floyd in 1970, the sleepy holiday capital
of the Cowal Peninsula last night welcomed the chart-topping Blur and an
attendant teen-scream following.
According to legend, Brian Wilson was the promoter of that Pink Floyd
show -- the same Brian Wilson who now sits as an MP in Westminster.
For those unversed in nineties music it should be pointed out that
Blur's Damon Albarn currently occupies a similar statesmanlike role,
that of Britpop's prime minister.
Before last night's show Albarn and his three Blur cronies certainly
hopped into a presidential, black, chauffeur-driven stretch limo less
than 50 yards from the entrance to the seafront venue of the concert,
the Queen's Hall.
They idled in a side street with no particular place to go on Dunoon's
circling main drag, a film crew recording their inability to cruise in
traditional head-turning rock star manner.
A carload of local youths were quick to seize the opportunity to wind
Blur up. ''Roll with it, Damon!'' one of them cried, hanging out of the
passenger window, reminding Albarn of the latest hit by Blur's supposed
deadliest enemies, Oasis.
Elsewhere another film crew focused on their on-screen front man,
standing in front of Dunoon's Rock Cafe, named in homage to seaside
confectionery and not musical idols.
Was Dunoon ruffled by Blur? Well, it must be said that almost as much
fuss was caused by my public use of a mobile phone.
Moments before I began dictating these words another group of local
youths sneered their verdict: ''Glasgow wide-o.'' It takes a lot to
impress Argyll folk.

<HEADLINE>Campaign call after reprocessing boost. Legal snub aids deals for Dounreay</HEADLINE>

DOUNREAY yesterday won an important round in its attempt to reprocess
foreign nuclear fuel.
However, the decision in its favour by Highland Regional Council's
planning committee was condemned by a leading anti-nuclear campaigner,
Mrs Lorraine Mann.
Mrs Mann, of Scotland Against Nuclear Dumping, called for a campaign
by the people of the Highlands.
The planning committee had rejected a call for the council to seek
QC's opinion on whether Dounreay's planning consents were sufficient to
cover the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from abroad.
The plant has already indicated it is pursuing contracts to reprocess
fuel rods from research reactors in Europe and elsewhere which had
originally been bound for storage in the US, their country of origin. A
public consultation in America has also suggested Dounreay as an option.
The council's director of planning, Mr Richard Cameron, told
councillors that he had not seen any evidence which suggested Dounreay's
consents, originally granted by the old Caithness County Council in the
1950s, were not sufficient. He did not, however, know of the scale of
operation being planned by the plant.
The council's chief solicitor, Mr Malcolm McRae, estimated that hiring
a senior QC to examine the issue would cost between #5000 and #10,000.
Caithness Councillor Jim Fry successfully moved that, in light of Mr
Cameron's comments and the likely cost to the council, the matter should
not be pursued any further.
Mrs Mann, who attended the meeting, said: ''The Highland people will
now have to take matters into their own hands and agitate more. It is a
complete sell-out by the planning committee. I just hope that when it
comes before the full regional council, councillors will have more
sense.
''The planning committee have effectively just said that Dounreay can
do whatever it wants to, that no planning permission is required whether
it is bringing in fuel from abroad to reprocess. It is absolutely vital
that they clarified the position.''
Cairngorm Councillor Dr Iain Glen, who supported the move to have the
legal position examined, said he would challenge the decision at the
full council. ''I think the full council will be more representative of
the people of the Highlands. The people on the planning committee tend
to be more established figures. I think the full council will take a
more sensible view.''
Earlier, the committee granted Dounreay permission to establish a new
waste pit. This was on the same site as the waste pits which had shocked
the committee while visiting in 1993. The Atomic Energy Authority had
wanted to extend the original pit, but planning permission was refused.
Mr Peter Peacock, vice convener, said: ''What we saw on that occasion
was a shambles and it shocked all of us.'' He said the photograph
published on the front page of The Herald shocked the nation. ''So it
was as well we went up to see what was going on.''
Mr Chris Bunyan, of the Northern European Nuclear Information Group,
said the decision showed the lack of care at Dounreay for their nuclear
waste. He said: ''I am pleased that the council has forced the
management at Dounreay to smarten up their act with these new designs.''

MAJOR Ivan Straker, the chairman of Ayr racecourse, has resigned.
His departure follows the dismissal of a senior member of staff after
financial irregularities, believed to involve a six-figure sum.
Major Straker, 66, said last night at his home in Edinburgh: ''The
buck stops at the top. The financial loss at Ayr is a disgrace and as
chairman of the club I will take the blame.''
It was also disclosed on the eve of the three-day Western Meeting that
secretary and treasurer Keith Tulloch offered to resign but was
persuaded to stay on and help inquiries by Strathclyde Police and
management consultants.
Scotland's premier racecourse is owned and run by the 600-member
strong Western Meeting Club.
Mr Tulloch said: ''I have offered my resignation and the committee of
the members has not accepted it. As treasurer, I accept there have been
irregularities and I thought it was the honourable thing to do.''
Thousands of racegoers are expected at the Craigie track over the next
three days for the biggest meeting of the Flat season in Scotland, which
has its climax on Saturday with the running of the #75,000 Ladbroke Ayr
Gold Cup.
Major Straker, former chairman and chief executive of the distilling
group Seagram UK Ltd, has recently undergone heart surgery and at first
it was thought he was resigning on health grounds, but last night he
dismissed that idea.
Only six days ago at an extraordinary general meeting, a call by Mr
Tony Collins, a Troon stockbroker, for an independent investigatation
into the management structure and financial procedures was approved,
despite the opposition of the club committee.
Major Straker joined the executive committee of the Western Meeting
Club in 1990 at the invitation of the then chairman Colonel David Greig.
He took over four years ago.
He said last night: ''I gave it my all and I believe Ayr is now a damn
good racecourse.''
When he took over the club had an overdraft of #800,000 and an annual
loss of #461,935. He appointed Mr Mark Kershaw to the post of general
manager. He helped bring the club back to financial stability and Ayr
racecourse into profit.
Major Straker said he was saddened by the in-fighting between members
who ''seemed to be tearing the club apart for reasons best known to
themselves''. He suggested it might be time for the club to consider
''divorcing itself' from the running of the racecourse.
The club committee paid tribute to Major Straker and said his
resignation had been accepted ''with reluctance''.
Mr J G ''Jake'' Stewart has agreed to take the chair until the annual
meeting in April.

Forsyth helps blunt the rail axe.
Reprieve for the sleepers
THE WEST Highland sleepers have beensaved. The reprieve for overnight
Fort William-London trains, threatened for more than a year, will be
officially announced today in Glasgow.
An expose in The Herald in April was instrumental in saving the
94-year-old service, which became a cause celebre for Scots of all
political persuasions.
Highland Regional Council vigorously pursued, through the courts, The
Herald revelation that ScotRail planned to run ''ghost trains'' to
circumvent statutory procedures on axing the sleepers.
The council successfully challenged BR twice, winning stays of
execution pending full public consultations.
The sleepers' fate has now been secured over the next seven years with
the recent return to the Scottish Office of Mr Michael Forsyth. He has
worked out a compromise deal, which means the Government will subsidise
the cross-Border services. They lose #2.5m a year but are widely
regarded as socially, economically, and emotionally vital to the
Highlands.
The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising will confirm the
''Deerstalkers'' are now included within the minimum level of services
that a train operator in Scotland must provide in return for subsidies.
Opraf, charged with overseeing railway privatisation, had excluded them
from the draft Passenger Service Requirement published earlier this
year.
It is understood subsidies will be available for a reduced service:
three sleepers a week during the summer, dropping to two in winter.
However, BR has just published its winter timetable, beginning
September 24, which it is almost certainly obliged to honour, and the
new timetable schedules a West Highland sleeper service to run
Mondays-Fridays and on Sundays until June 1.
It no longer schedules the ''ghost train'' which The Herald exposed as
being of no benefit to the travelling public and a ruse to avoid
procedures under the 1993 Railways Act.
Lord Kirkwood, in the Court of Session, agreed, and three judges later
rejected BR's appeal against his ruling over the 23.58
Maryhill-Bishopbriggs service.
Last night, a wide cross section of Scottish opinion paid tribute to
The Herald's exposing of the ''ghost train'' as a device to withdraw the
sleepers.
Labour's Scottish transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, said it
showed rail privatisation was ''on the rack''. He added: ''The Herald
must be congratulated for exposing the 'ghost trains' which undermined
the sleepers.''
A spokesman for Highlands and Islands Enterprise called the new
arrangement ''a good deal for the Highlands'', adding that a
''year-round sleeper service is crucial to tourism and business links''.
Pressure group Friends of the West Highland Line said: ''It's good
news.''
It is understood that to keep costs down, a Fort William carriage will
be added to the existing London-Aberdeen-Inverness sleeper, which splits
at Edinburgh.
Labour's Scottish industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said one coach
on a train which divided into three parts was not the answer, but was
better than nothing. He added: ''The reprieve is a tremendous victory
for all who have campaigned since the franchise director's intentions
became known. This was a grassroots campaign which eventually even the
architects of rail privatisation had to take into account.''
Hopes that sleepers would survive rose last week when Mr Forsyth had a
private meeting with Highland Regional Council. It is clear he has
played a major role in saving the Anglo-Scottish link.
Highland region's convener, Mr Duncan McPherson, declined to comment,
other than to declare that he remained quite optimistic about today's
outcome.
BR is now expected to drop thoughts of appealing to the House of Lords
over the three judges' ruling that it had acted illegally. ScotRail
warnings that cuts would have to be imposed elsewhere unless sleeper
costs were covered should also disappear.
Today's announcement will be made by Mr Garry Butler, Opraf's
London-based assistant director with responsibility for ScotRail's sale.
However, it is expected the PSR -- a contractual obligation on train
operators to deliver a specified level of service -- will still contain
fewer services than those in place today. Worst scenario estimates are
of a 10% reduction.
Certainly, the PSR will not cover Strathclyde, the largest commuter
network outside London. Opraf had hoped to settle differences with the
regional council in time to include the area within the document. Such a
big hole where Strathclyde should be has already led the Scottish
Liberal Democrats to dismiss the whole exercise as ''the Polo mint
privatisation''.
The region's refusal to lose control over services and fares that its
council taxpayers' subsidise is also behind delays in ScotRail's
privatisation timetable.
Opraf's invitation to tender for the franchise, originally scheduled
for this month, has been postponed until the spring -- and could be off
next year's agenda completely.
However, it is expected to insist that the Government's published
target of selling 51% of BR's passenger services by next April still
stands.
Despite protests, it is likely that the franchise holder will not need
to provide sleepers between Plymouth and Glasgow, or Motorail services,
or overnight seated accommodation between London, Glasgow, and Aberdeen.
Opraf is likely to argue that Scotland will still receive the highest
level of guaranteed rail services in Britain, with subsidies of around
95% of current services.
It will insist all day-time services, all routes, and stations will be
protected, and that the PSR will also safeguard sleepers from Aberdeen,
Inverness, Glasgow, and Edinburgh over the seven-year franchise period.
* BR's winter timetable shows a southbound sleeper leaving Fort
William at 19.45, and a northbound sleeper leaving Euston at 21.30 on
weekdays. Times differ on Sundays.

THE TUC agreed a motion yesterday backing a statutory minimum wage
which made no reference to a specific figure, a vote in line with the
wishes of Labour leader Tony Blair.
The delegates were apparently conceding it is the role of a Labour
government to decide at what level to introduce its promised national
minimum wage, but there were dissenting voices.
Leaders of several key unions indicated they would continue to press
for an initial level of #4.15 an hour and would vote for such a figure
if it remained on the agenda for next month's Labour Party conference.
Women activists also staged a demonstration at the start of the
debate.
A group of 30 wore T-shirts emblazoned with the figure #4.15.
They posed for photographers and drew loud applause from delegates,
forcing TUC general secretary John Monks to interrupt his speech to the
Brighton Congress.
Tireless lobbying and cajoling by TUC leaders in recent weeks had
ensured that amendments seeking to insert the figure of #4.15 were
withdrawn from the TUC agenda. Labour leaders will no doubt try to
emulate their success.
However, no amount of stage managing could disguise the deep
divisisons among union leaders on how to implement the previously agreed
formula of an initial level of half median male earnings.
Mr Monks urged delegates not to spoil a mood of unity and the search
for a strong TUC position. ''Our position at the moment is clear. It is
not ducking anything. It is honest. You can buy the T-shirts and wear
the baseball caps but we are going to make a big attempt to establish
minimum standards by agreement with employers.''
Mr Monks pledged the TUC would publish a target figure for a national
minimum wage after further research later this year.
During the debate, Mr Garfield Davies, general secretary of the shop
workers' union Usdaw, said a minimum wage was the single most important
improvement any government could make for low paid workers. But he
stressed: ''Our members know that without a Labour government there will
be no minimum wage.''
The deputy general secretary of the Graphical Paper and Media Union,
Mr Tony Burke, said even a minimum rate of #4-an-hour would produce a
salary of only #166 for a 40-hour week. ''Is that too much to ask? It
would take Marks &amp; Spencer boss Sir Richard Greenbury less than
one-and-a-half hours to earn #166.''
Mr John Sheldon, general secretary of the National Union of Civil and
Public Servants, said to cheers from delegates: ''Our members are fed up
to the back teeth from hearing that this country cannot afford a target
of #4.15-an-hour.'' He believed the minimum wage was a vote winner.
Mr Tony Young, joint general secretary of the Communication Workers
Union, warned against turning a potential electoral advantage into a
''disaster''.
''Instead of a tax bombshell we don't want a job loss bombshell.''
The president of the GMB, Mr Dick Pickering, said directors at Asda
were earning ''big bucks'' but check-out staff were on ''chicken feed''
of #3.67-an-hour.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, said he hoped that unity had broken out. ''We support
the General Council's target of #4-an-hour and I say to our opponents,
if you cannot live on less than that don't ask anyone else to do so.''
In an earlier debate the leader of the largest TUC and Labour Party
affiliate, Unison, re-affirmed his union's commitment to a #4.15
figures.
* Britain's biggest union, Unison, announced it was increasing the pay
of 28 casual staff at the union's holiday centre in Devon to
#4.15-an-hour.

PLANS were announced yesterday for a new international liner terminal
and one of the biggest waterfront developments in Europe, which could
bring 1500 jobs to Leith.
The #60m complex includes a hotel, cinema, and shopping facilities at
Ocean Terminal alongside the new Scottish Office building at Victoria
Quay.
Outline permission is being sought by Forth Properties, a subsidiary
of Forth Ports plc. If it clears all the planning hurdles without
objections, the terminal could be ready to receive its first ship within
three years.
Last year a total of 37 liners docked at Leith, bringing substantial
tourist income to the Edinburgh area.
Mr Terry Smith, Forth Properties managing director, said: ''We believe
that with modern handling facilities we can considerably increase this
figure.
''We also hope to be able to start cruises from Edinburgh, rather than
remain just a visiting port. A number of operators have said if there
are new facilities they will be keen to look at this option.''
A further boost would also come if Forth Ports succeeds in its bid for
Tilbury docks, including the London cruise liner terminal, which handles
more than three times Leith's business.
''We would hope to attract vessels which presently choose one stop in
Britain to come to Leith as well,'' Mr Smith said.
He said it was likely to provide the equivalent of 1500 new full-time
jobs, in addition to those in the construction phase. The terminal
itself would safeguard and expand the workforce directly employed in
dealing with the ferries. In addition, workers would also be needed for
the hotel, shops, and cinema.
''We think these will provide real long-term jobs for people in Leith.
There is a lot of local skills that can fill the jobs in the shopping
and leisure developments,'' he added.
The three-storey development has been designed by Sir Terence Conran
and incorporates some energy-saving aspects, possibly including a wind
turbine.
''This will provide the city of Edinburgh with a new view over the
magnificent waterscape of Leith, and a means of welcoming visitors by
sea and land,'' Sir Terence said.
''The building is modern, optimistic, and a fitting addition, we hope,
to Edinburgh's built heritage.''
The terminal will have parking for 1500 cars, a direct link to the
planned tramway running north to Edinburgh, a health club, some housing,
and a 120-bed hotel.
It also stands to benefit from trade provided by 1800 civil servants,
who have moved to their new building amid some criticism of lack of
nearby facilities.
Mr Smith said the letting agents had already received strong levels of
interest from retailers. Instead of using a large supermarket as a
magnet, the complex is aiming to attract small quality shops unable to
set up in the city centre because of high rents.
''This will be one of the biggest waterfront developments in Europe,
an asset for Leith, a new buzzing commercial and tourism district for
Edinburgh, and an advertisement for a progressive Scotland.
''It is a statement of confidence as we approach the new millenium.''
* Records are already being broken by the new #38m Edinburgh
International Conference Centre which opened yesterday.
It has secured bookings for 100 events, the highest number of
pre-opening bookings for any conference venue in the UK. It means a #22m
boost for Scotland and bookings stretch to the year 2005.
