AN over-supply of financial advisers in the marketplace makes it all
the more imperative for the would-be entrepreneur to shop around for
advice, especially when it comes to the legal niceties.
Failure to take proper legal advice when a company is contemplating
change, for example, can prove a recipe for disaster. It can lead to the
exact opposite of any aspirations a firm may have towards making
progress.
In a legal overview, David Bennett, convener of the company law
committee of the Law Society of Scotland, said he is heartened to report
that the number of business insolvencies has dimished.
Whether Scotland has an economy brimming with confidence or fairly
dull as it stands at present, companies will still be making plans for
the future.
A recent UK survey of where firms went for finance indicated a little
more stability in the marketplace. However, it pointed out that most
companies were still reluctant to borrow and provide for long-term
planning, and with it growth.
In such a climate they preferred to make savings ''internally''
through the likes of staff cuts and by tapping accumulated reserves and
profits. The outcome, therefore, was a situation where an over-reliance
on short-termist finance still dominated.
Yet it really doesn't have to be so. David Bennett said the number of
companies incorporated and creeping onwards was growing, usually a sign
that enterprise was flowing back into the market, and that things were
picking up.
What doesn't help matters is the various internal changes occurring
within the major Scottish banks. The relationship with your
once-familiar banker has radically altered in recent times. Change may
have been carried out by the banks for the best of reasons, but the
effect was still unsettling.
''It is going to take a little while before businesses here feel
sufficiently assured of the climate in which they are working, to go to
their bank with an idea,'' he said.
''There is perhaps an over-supply of advisers in the marketplace at
present when it comes to a risk taker looking round for the kind of
advice needed.
''Choice of adviser, therefore, has to be taken with extreme care and
with an educated eye, in terms of both cost and effectiveness.''
Legal advice was like any other highly-skilled task. The customer or
client, whatever you may call him or her, often only knew how good that
advice was once it was given and the effects known. Then, of course, it
could be too late.
To that end, the Law Society recently introduced a strategy to upgrade
educational standards of the professional and established accredited
specialist.
David Bennett said: ''Company law has become so complicated, and
whilst people involved slave away to try to simplify it, law reform is
not a major topic as we approach the run-up to the General Election.''
Much of the legislation in the past has occurred on a crisis
management basis, and unfortunately this has established a rather risky
backdrop to which businesses have to operate.
''It has become an increasingly specialist, not to mention
sub-specialist role, where the adviser has to absorb the most amazing
amount of detail.'' The end product is that an individual specialist has
been supplanted by suitable teams of specialists. No one person can do
it alone.
David Bennett is constantly involved in Law Society think tank work
which he maintains keeps him on his toes. As an established company law
insolvency specialist, he is quick to point out that there is a great
misnomer in insolvency legislation. He prefers the term corporate
rescue.
''Okay, once you get to the point of the actual insolvency process
then something has gone wrong and has to be sorted,'' he said.
''However, if a company gets the opportunity, it is a question of
doing everything possible to avoid such a situation coming about. Here I
do not think the banks get sufficient credit for the work they do to
rescue companies. A client-business must go to its bank soon enough.''
As the Law Society's company law committee convener, David Bennett is
obviously closely involved in law reform together with conducting
advisory functions to the Government. He is the author of several books,
the latest of which is An Introduction to the Law of Partnership in
Scotland, one of a series produced through the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland.
''Partnership law is ill developed and not understood,'' he said.
Current working legislation involves the Act of Parliament 1890 which
is, as would be expected, immersed in ancient principles.
His book is designed to provide students and accountancy practitioners
alike with a description of the law applicable in Scotland to the
constitution of partnerships, their relationships to third parties,
their internal affairs and dissolution.
It also serves as a prime example of how two major institutions can
effectively work together. This represents an ideal where lawyers and
accountants more often than not collaborate to the benefit of a client.
Peter Johnston, chief executive of the ICAS, said the book launch
meant something special to him as it reminded him of his days studying
law. ''The development of Green the publishers in recent years, in terms
of both style and production, is enormously useful.''
The book covers various partnership aspects, including joint ventures,
a firm's name, maximum size of a partnership allowed, persons who may be
partners, illegality affecting partnerships, relationship of a firm to
third parties, and liability of a firm for wrongs.
The final message from David Bennett perhaps has a repetitive note to
it, but nevertheless it represents a crucial piece of advice.
''Partnership Law is a prime case in question. You must take proper
advice, or else the most fearful mistakes can occur.'' The same applied
wherever legalities were involved.

question. You must take proper advice, or

The fast and demanding pace of modern living means that many people
cannot afford the time to wait in the queue for treatment in health
service hospitals. As increasing numbers go private, Bill Knox examines
the advantages on offer
A STRAW poll around Glasgow's private hospitals leaves no doubt about
the main reasons why their patients choose private health care.
Prompt attention tops the list, followed closely by better, often
hotel-style facilities. Food and extra care are also highly rated.
''The fact that an initial appointment with a consultant working in
the private sector can be arranged within a short time and that
treatment, including admission to a private room, can be arranged
equally quickly and at a time to suit the patient are priority
factors,'' said one medical practitioner.
''Patients who choose private treatment can also make a choice of
consultant, and most consultants work in both the public and private
sectors.''
The combination of convenience and reassurance can be equally
important whether the patient involved is a business executive or shop
floor worker, a mother with young children, a pensioner, or the youngest
of patients.
''But food in terms of an attractive and always changing choice of
menu also matters a lot.
''In fact, if you are in hospital for a week or 10 days, the quality
of meals becomes a priority. People are not prepared to tolerate poor
standards of meals or service, particularly when they are ill or
recovering from an operation. A little extra hotel-style qualilty of
care is particularly welcome.''
Today's overall medical situation, with more and more cases now being
regarded as in the day-patient or short-stay category, means an
increased number of people being treated. The private hospitals are
gearing up to match this.
The HCI Medical Centre at Clydebank is a spacious, one-off flagship
style hospital where every room has a bedside computer and where family
suites are available with His and Her twin fitted bathrooms with
gold-plated fittings. Part of the complex, directly linked to the main
hospital block, is a luxury hotel.
A satellite link brings in Middle East television programmes. Cultural
and religious needs, including dietary requirements, are met in full,
and consultants have a wide range of the latest medical equipment
available for treatments.
At Ross Hall Hospital in Glasgow, prominent among the city's private
health care centres, a major programme of refurbishment over the summer
began with a complete rebuild for the front hall and reception area, and
went on to include the reorganisation and relocation of many specialist
departments.
The result is major improvements for staff and patients alike, and in
the process a first chance for many visitors to see the magnificent
stretches of wood panelling and carvings which survive from the days of
the original mansionhouse, much of which still exists inside the heart
of the hospital complex.
A recent addition to the range of private medicine available in
Scotland, Langside Priory Hospital in Glasgow opened in March this year.
It is Scotland's first and only private hospital specialising in the
treatment of acute psychiatric illnesses.
Part of the Priory Hospital Group, it incorporates a day patient unit
and 20 beds, with each in-patient having their own room and en-suite
facilities.
Day or in-patient programmes address emotional or psychological
problems, and the aim is to provide therapy which will enable patients
to return to the community after a short stay.
Problems addressed can include alcohol related problems, behavioural
problems, eating disorders and stress or depression. Treatment can be
followed by free weekly aftercare for ex-patients.
Bon Secours, the oldest of Glasgow's private hospitals, recently
underwent major refurbishment and has advanced plans for further work.
One of its latest facilities is the provision of mother-and-child rooms
so that the youngest of their patients can always have immediate
reassurance at hand day or night.
''Those families and individuals who wish private hospital treatment
now include a very large number who would never have dreamed of it
before,'' said one management spokesman. ''They are people who have
investigated health care and then have decided to prioritise their
budgets.''
''It is true that not everyone wants to sign into an insurance plan.
In many private hospitals they can take advantage of ''fixed price''
operations and procedures, which cover all expenses including room
charges. It is a one-off situation which may be the answer to some
people's needs.
''Some of the patients involved travel considerable distances to come
here. It is certainly true that the numbers of younger people are
rising, as well as patients who wish private rooms with en-suite
bathrooms, their own telephone and their own TV set. They also want
other benefits such as an absence of any kind of ward-style life, and no
restrictions on visitors apart from those of ordinary commonsense.
''But we also have business executives who book in for non-urgent
surgery during their holiday time, and parents who schedule an operation
so that a partner can be at home then to look after the children.''
Day-care treatment facilities including private rooms to match with
modern medical techniques mean that some patients no longer have to even
stay overnight.
Greater flexibility, too, is available for straight-forward
out-patient treatment, with many needs being met by appointments at
evenings and at weekends.
And when a business executive has to be admitted as a patient for a
few days they can discover that many private hospitals can provide
secretarial and fax facilities to allow them to keep in touch . . . . if
they really must.

Gavin Bell visits the Borders library that holds the key to Walter
Scott's inspiration.
It has lain virtually undisturbed for more than 150 years. In a room
in an ornate house on the banks of the Tweed, the magnificent library of
Sir Walter Scott is much as he left it on the autumn day on which he
died in 1832.
Over the years, only a few scholars have been permitted to browse
through the priceless collection of almost 10,000 leather-bound volumes
in search of knowledge about Scott and his work. Now for the first time,
experts around the world are to be invited to examine the library in
detail to build up a picture of the themes that inspired Scott's writing
-- essentially to 'unlock the mind' of the man widely regarded as the
father of the modern novel.
The structured programme of research and publication is being
organised by the Faculty of Advocates, which owns the library, and has
been authorised by direct descendants of Sir Walter living in his home
at Abbotsford, near Galashiels. It will be directed by Mr Douglas
Gifford, Professor of Scottish Literature at Glasgow University, who was
appointed Honorary Librarian at Abbotsford last year.
At the same time, funds raised for the project through a charitable
trust will also used for conservation work, to ensure the long-term
survival of the library as part of Scotland's cultural heritage and a
unique scholarly resource.
Mr Angus Stewart, Q.C., the present Keeper of the Library, says the
Faculty is ''immensely proud'' of the Scott connection. ''We are aware
of the great privilege and responsibility which ownership of the
Abbotsford collection involves, and we are pleased that an opportunity
has now emerged of making the collection and its significance better
known.''
Citing a growing interest in Scott, and the impending publication of a
new edition of all the Waverly novels, Mr Stewart says: ''We believe
carefully organized research of the library will have much to tell us
about Scott the man, as well as the sources of inspiration for Scott the
author.
''We are still trying to find out what extent there have been
additions to, or losses from, the library. But as far as we can gather,
these have been fairly minimal and the collection is essentially
intact.''
The five-year project will bring together pairs of scholars, each pair
comprising an expert in Scott's writing and another in the theme being
examined. For example, the editor of a new edition of Redgauntlet would
work with an expert in chivalry, and a scholar on demonology would pair
up with an authority on that aspect of Scott's work. Eventually all of
the findings will be published, adding substantially to public knowledge
about the author.
One of the first tasks will be to transcribe Reliquuiae Trotcosienses,
a 126-page collection of notes and comments by Scott on the assembly of
his library, which it is hoped will provide clues for the researchers to
follow up.
Professor Gifford is excited at the prospect of analysing what he
regards as the finest private library in Scotland. ''This is a
collection that has been frozen in time since 1832, and there has never
been a proper, systematic evaluation of it,'' he says. ''It is full of
secrets we have yet to discover. We are exploring the essence of Scott
himself.''
The reason scholars expect so much from the research, according to
Professor Gifford, is that Scott used books as source material for his
work more than any other important writer. His library is crammed with
accounts of the Jacobite rebellions, which inspired much of his work, as
well as an eclectic collection of Norse Sagas, the tales of King Arthur,
and treatises on the supernatural.
''Burns relied more on the oral tradition,'' Professor Gifford says.
''He was a tacky-fingered poet, picking up bits and pieces from tales
and conversations. For Scott, on the other hand, the library at
Abbotsford was the quarry from which much of his work came.''
He believes the importance of the library is indicated by the motto
and the book imprint that Scott devised for it -- the Latin motto means
roughly 'When I am enclosed, I am safe', and the imprint is a golden
portcullis. ''I think they symbolise how crucial the library and his
study were to him. Here we have the writer in his ultimate retreat,
pulling down the portcullis to withdraw into the inner world of ideas
and feelings, nourished by the books around him. It is the inner sanctum
where we find the heart of Scott.''
The project is still at an early planning stage, but Professor Gifford
envisages the first major publication will be of Scott's own account of
the library being assembled. The next is likely to be a scholarly
overview of the collection.
He has no illusions about reviving the popularity Scott enjoyed in his
lifetime, but he believes the project will stimulate renewed interest in
the author and make him more accessible to the public.
''It would be fallacious to pretend that Scott is everyone's cup of
tea. He was a much more private person than Burns, for example, and he
is not as accessible as Robert Louis Stevenson, so I see this is a bit
of a challenge.
''But behind his heavy syntax and love of footnotes, he was
passionately devoted to Scotland and to preserving its identity as part
of Britain. So in a sense we will be trying to restore Scott as a
meaningful and relevant figure to contemporary Scotland. And his library
is a way into the man, a way to shed light on how he created.''
Following a meeting of the steering committee later this month, the
first formal event connected with the project will be a fund-raising
concert at the Signet Library in Edinburgh on December 1. It will
include Scott-inspired works such as Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor,
Bizet's La Jolie Fille de Perth, and Sullivan's Ivanhoe, as well as some
of Scott's own songs and traditional Border music. The event is being
sponsored by the Bank of Scotland as part of its Tercentenary
celebrations.
Professor Gifford admits his enthusiasm may not be shared by the wider
public, but insists the project will be of enormous benefit to those who
admire Scott. ''I'm not sure at the end of the day how successful we can
be in enjoying public interest. But unless academics make the effort,
with this wonderful resource available to us, we will never have a
complete picture of one of the most important and influential figures in
Scottish literature. We are exploring the essence of Scott, and at least
for us that is very exciting.''
Such sentiments are shared by Dr Eric Anderson, the Rector of Lincoln
College at Oxford, and a leading authority on Scott. ''It certainly
sounds like a most exciting project,'' he says. ''We know that Scott
remembered a great deal more of what he read than most of us, and it
would be very interesting to explore the relationship between his
reading and various themes in his own writing.''
Dr Anderson is particularly interested in learning more about the
degree of 'poetic licence' exercised by Scott in relation to his
historical novels. ''We know he took liberties with Scottish history in
novels like Rob Roy, for example. It would be fascinating to know how
far the creative artist took precedence over the historian in others
that touched on English and French history.
''Whatever emerges from this project, it is very encouraging that the
Faculty of Advocates is not simply keeping the library, but is promoting
research. It is very forward looking and imaginative.''
The source of all this passionate interest lies in an oak-panelled
room, beneath a richly moulded ceiling, with a large bay window
overlooking a meadow on the banks of the Tweed. The books lie behind
locked grills, attesting to Scott's voracious appetite for literature in
several languages -- Italian, Spanish, French, German and Latin. The
only existing catalogue, published six years after Scott's death, lists
9,506 titles.
It is an eclectic collection, and scholars will find much to ponder in
its organisation -- in one case alone, by Scott's fireside chair, there
are volumes of history, poetry and memoirs. Elsewhere, there is The
Byrth, Lyf, and Actes of King Arthur, published in 1817, and a French
version of the memoirs of Lancelot. Of more relevance to the Scottish
novels of Scott, there are the Memoirs of the Rebellion 1745-46, by the
Chevalier de Johnstone, aid-de-camp (sic) to Lord George Murray, General
of the Rebel Army.
The collection is still watched over by a bust of Scott, and a large
oil painting of his eldest son in the uniform of a cornet in the 18th
Hussars.
Further evidence of Scott's passion for collecting lies in a glass
case by the bay window. Among other memorabilia are displayed Rob Roy's
purse and skean-dhu, a silver brooch that belonged to his wife Helen
MacGregor, and a lock of Bonnie Prince Charlie's hair.
If the library was the source of Scott's inspiration, the study next
door was where it came to fruition in a series of novels which scholars
regard as one of the most remarkable feats in literary history. Here his
writing desk and leather chair dominate a small room, surrounded by
shelves of books on the ground floor and an upper gallery. A small door
in the gallery leads to a turret staircase to Scott's bedroom, which
allowed him to come down early in the morning to write without
disturbing the household.
In 1935 two secret drawers were discovered in the desk, one of which
contained 57 letters between Scott and his wife before and after their
marriage. It is now hoped that further secrets will emerge from
scholarly perusal of the library.    Mrs Patricia Maxwell-Scott and her
sister Dame Jean Maxwell-Scott, descendants of the author who live at
Abbotsford, have welcomed the project. ''I think it's a wonderful
idea,'' Dame Jean says. ''Anything that increases people's knowledge of
Sir Walter is good. It's such a beautiful library, and it's lovely that
people will finally get to know what is in it.''

SCOTLAND had arranged a World Cup warm-up game against Romania, which
was to be my last appearance at Murrayfield in an international jersey,
together with a week's tour of Spain as part of our World Cup
preparations.
The 26-man squad was duly announced two weeks after the Twickenham
game, the only surprise being a space left open in the No.9 slot for the
injured Andy Nicol to go in alongside Bryan Redpath. Andy, however,
injured himself again and Derek Patterson, who had played against South
Africa, was reinstated into the World Cup squad.
Going into the Romanian match, I was asked what my hopes and thoughts
were for my last game for Scotland at Murrayfield, where I had enjoyed
so many triumphs and, dare I say, some disasters.
I replied that I had not really been thinking about it and did not
know what my emotions were going to be. I was more concerned for
Scotland to get back into a winning streak and reproduce some of our
Five Nations form.
We did better than that, with some glorious tries from delightful
running rugby, which ended with a convincing victory.
Murrayfield rose to its feet and gave me a standing ovation as I
limped from the field five minutes from time which was unquestionably
one of the most uplifting experiences of my career.
I also saw my leaving the field as an ideal opportunity for Cameron
Glasgow, who was on the bench and the only uncapped player in the World
Cup party, to come on, so that the whole squad could go to South Africa
as capped internationalists.
I had seen Cameron warming up by the side of the running track and so
I summoned James Robson, our team physio, to come and get me and walked
off happy in the knowledge that Cameron was going to come on and win his
first cap.
Imagine his horror, therefore, when Douglas Morgan ran down from the
stand to tell Cameron that he was not going on while Scott was being
summoned from the replacements' bench high up in the stand.
Not surprisingly, Cameron was distraught and my heart went out to him.
I thought the insensitivity of the ''powers that be'' on that occasion
was among the worst I had experienced in all the years that I had played
for Scotland.
Duncan Paterson was to be quoted later as saying that the timing was
not right for a new player to come on and win his first cap.
I, personally, could not think of a better time for a new cap to come
on than when Scotland were playing an international match against
Romania, with the game well won and under no pressure.
Cameron had been on the bench all season and had been selected for the
World Cup squad, so he had to be good enough.
I can understand Duncan's reluctance to give away caps too cheaply,
but I do not believe that this was a case of giving away a cheap cap,
for if a player is a member of such a squad, then he is deserving of a
cap at any time.
On this occasion it would have given the player a tremendous boost. In
the event, he got smashed that night and had to be consoled by many of
the players, and some like Rob Wainwright, spoke out against the
terrible decision.
Cameron certainly had the sympathy of all the players who were furious
at such a miserable decision.
''I saw my leaving the field as an ideal opportunity for Cameron
Glasgow, who was on the bench and the only uncapped player in the World
Cup party, to come on, so the whole squad could go to South Africa as
capped internationalists.''

<TEXT>
A MURRAYFIELD victory over Wales set us up for a Grand Slam decider at
Twickenham for the first time since 1920. The players worked hard and
played to a very high standard and we had thoroughly deserved our three
wins in the Five Nations, coupled with the win over Canada.
Four victories in eight weeks was a welcome relief to Scottish rugby
after the drought of the previous year and it vindicated the Scottish
selectors in making 10 changes for the match against Canada.
Many people believed 10 changes were too many, but what they had done
was to pick the players who were in form and who had performed well
throughout the Scottish Inter-District Championship.
In the build-up to the England game, I wanted the players to enjoy
themselves, after what they had achieved; whatever else happened, there
would be no disgrace in losing to England.
Personally, I was glad that the English match was at Twickenham, where
England would be overwhelming favourites, for I felt that there would
have been too much pressure on our players had the game been at
Murrayfield.
I was confident of Scotland's ability to disrupt England, for I
thought England played with a limited game-plan for most of the
tournament, whereas Scotland had played some exuberant rugby and I knew
that if we could play along similar lines we could give them trouble,
and so it proved.
The one blight on that match was caused by Brian Moore's comments
after the match and, much as I respect him as a competitor and a rugby
player, I felt that he let himself down badly that day with his
ill-timed, ill-judged, and ill-informed comment.
He was obviously upset that England had not performed in the way that
he would have wished, but to try and denigrate Scotland's performance
and almost to accuse them of cheating was unworthy.
It seemed that Moore was merely trying to make a name for himself by
being absurdly controversial in order, perhaps, to sell a few more
books.
I, for one, will certainly not bother to buy his autobiography when he
makes such absurd statements.
I said after the match that the Scotland team would not have had to
perform much better than we did to have won the match but we certainly
needed to be more disciplined.
Also, in my view, we failed to take our chances. Not a try was scored
and, because of the desperately competitive nature of the game, it all
became a little incoherent and England won by seven penalties and a drop
goal, all by Rob Andrew, who passed Jonathan Webb's record aggregate for
England.
Craig Chalmers kicked two well-taken early drop goals for us and I got
two penalty goals, to finish the Five Nations with 56 points from the
four games, breaking my own championship record set in 1986.
My brother, Scott, also became Scotland's most capped centre.
Overall, I was extremely proud of the Scottish team's performance that
day, but I was extremely disappointed in Moore's attitudes and comments
on England's troublesome opponents.
We then had another farce, when the Twickenham authorities could find
no place for presenting the trophy, because of the reconstruction work
at Twickenham, even though the Calcutta Cup, the Five Nations
Championship, the Triple Crown, and the Grand Slam had all been at
stake.
So, instead of presenting it before tens of thousands of fans at the
stadium, they had the joke situation of presenting it before the few
hundred lucky enough to be at the post-match dinner.
I was astonished that they could not present the trophy to the winning
captain at the end of the game. To me it typified a lack of
professionalism and foresight, which seems more pronounced than in the
rugby unions of the Southern hemisphere.
Some 14 weeks earlier, when Twickenham was in an even more unfinished
state, they had presented the Bowring Bowl to the winning Cambridge
captain at the Varsity match. Were some commercial pressures brought to
bear in order to make that possible?
When they did eventually get around to the presentation, there was a
huge anti-climax, particularly when Will Carling almost begrudgingly
suggested to his players that they should come up and shake the
President's hand. Will, for all his supposed motivational qualities,
clearly let his side down by his setting of the scene and the dullness
of his remarks. When the England team came up, there was not a single
clap in the whole room, which for me was unbelievable, and perhaps was
some indication of the antipathy which was rumoured to have existed
between the RFU Committee and the team.
I enjoyed having a chat at the dinner with Jack Rowell, the England
coach, and he told me that he was extremely worried 20 minutes into the
second half when, from an inside pass by Scott, I cut through Steve
Ojomoh with only Mike Catt to beat.
Speaking to Mike afterwards, he thought that I had beaten him, but
somehow he had managed to knock the ball out of my hand and the try
opportunity went begging.
Rowell thought that, had we scored, Scotland might well have won. He
was most generous and gracious in victory and so were most of the
England players, as they normally are.
Moore was the odd man out and he left a sour taste in every Scotsman's
mouth. We were looking for some grace in victory.
''Moore was obviously upset that England had not performed in the way
that he would have wished, but to try and denigrate Scotland's
performance and almost to accuse them of cheating was unworthy.''

FOR Rangers, who hope finally to sign Morton's Derek McInnes sometime
today, the latest medical bulletin concerning Stephen Wright was not
good. This week the defender will travel to America where he will
undergo knee surgery similar to that which has already helped Ian
Durrant and Andy Goram.
The damage to Wright's knee ligaments is not as bad as that which
threatened the career of Durrant, whose knee had to be rebuilt
completely, but it is probably on a par with that of Goram and his road
back to recovery was a long one.
Wright will benefit from the ligament of a donor, but he will not be
seen in action again until next season. The 24-year-old was injured
while trying to cope with Juventus's Gianluca Vialli early in last
week's Champions' League match at Irbox, and had to be removed on a
stretcher.
The seriousness of his injury is typical of the suffering which has
been visitied upon Ibrox in recent years.
There can be few other clubs in Britain who have had to send so many
players for operations because of serious knee injuries.

<HEADLINE>No 'slanging' Hastings' claims. Union decide to hold fire</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish Rugby Union declined to become involved in a war of words
with its most recently retired captain yesterday as the dust settled on
Gavin Hastings' claim that the Union was trying to buy its players on
the cheap.
In The Herald yesterday, Hastings accused the SRU of talking down the
value of its international stars and warned that Scotland's
semi-professionals stood little chance of competing on an equal footing
with the full-time All Blacks, who each will earn #100,000 during next
summer's tour to New Zealand.
The former Scotland captain, who retired after the World Cup with a
record 61 Scottish caps and the Northern Hemisphere points' scoring
record, also called for the Murrayfield committee structure to be
scrapped on the basis that a professional game had to be run by
professionals.
Yesterday, SRU senior vice-president Fred McLeod, who has been the
Union's lead negotiator at the ongoing talks with the players -- the
contract, worth about #22,500, is now with the players' representatives
and being examined by lawyers -- said that he did not want to become
involved in a ''slanging match'' with the former Scotland captain.
McLeod, a veteran administrator who was also a member of the
International Rugby Football Board working party on amateurism which
ushered in the professional era, said: ''My initital reaction is that we
should discuss the matter with our new public relations advisers and
take it from there.''
This week, The Herald is running exclusive extracts from Hastings' new
autobiography and McLeod added:''I'm told that there are three days of
it. Maybe it would be better if we were to wait until we have seen all
of it and then decide whether or not we should respond.''
Asked if he was disappointed by Hastings' comments McLeod declared:
''Past Scottish captains have criticised the SRU before and, sadly, I
have no doubt that they will do so again. I really don't think that I
should comment further at this stage. Gavin is a national hero and the
tendency will be for people to believe what he says.
''If I were to comment, it would just turn into a slanging match and I
don't think that does anyone any good. It is probably best to say
nothing.''
However, McLeod did add: ''When he talks about the New Zealand tour,
and the amount of money that our players might receive for being members
of the party, the fact is that we have not discussed the tour in terms
of money. The current negotiations are for the period covering the
Western Samoa game and the Five Nations. I think it goes without saying
that there will be a separate agreement for New Zealand.''
Today, Hastings criticises the rugby hierarchy for the decision which
denied the Heriot's FP utility back, Cameron Glasgow, a cap during
Scotland's game against Romania at Murrayfield just prior to the World
Cup.
Glasgow, who remains uncapped despite having been a member of the
World Cup squad in South Africa, had been stripped and ready for action
as a replacement for Hastings as the captain left the field injured in
the closing moments. However, he was told that he was not going on and
Scott Hastings went on in his place.
Yesterday, Hastings Sr said: ''It was just bad man management. I have
no idea who was responsible for making that decision.
''Cammie Glasgow had sat on the bench all year. He was a very upset
young man. I came off confident that Cammie was going to win his first
cap. He was down there at the side of the pitch. Then, as soon as I'm
off he is told that he isn't going on. It was an extraordinary decision.
''He may now never get a cap. He would be the very last person to say
that he had won a cap playing a brilliant game against Romania, but it
would have put him in a better frame of mind for the World Cup where he
could have gone as a capped player.
''The management just were not thinking about the bigger picture. That
incident could have been utilised in such a positive way in the World
Cup if he had gone out as a capped international. It was just silly,''
said Hastings.

IT is difficult to find enthusiasm for Scotland's final European
Championship qualifying match, but on the basis that the nation is still
in a state of shock following a couple of miserable performances by the
Old Firm against foreign opponents, it might be therapeutic to show up
at Hampden a week tomorrow night.
Fair enough, Scotland are playing San Marino, who have never won a
match of any consequence, but the prospect of seeing Scots score a few
goals might gladden all our hearts and act as a balm to sooth the angst.
Craig Brown's team have already qualified for the European finals,
which will be played out in England next summer, and they could stroll
through the match against San Marino, but the players have a duty to
perform for the fans and score as many times as they possibly can.
Yesterday the manager listed 22 players in his senior squad -- the
under-21 side also will be playing next week -- six of whom are
strikers.
Ally McCoist, who scored both Rangers' goals against Falkirk on
Saturday, was included even though his form recently has been
indifferent, but Brown cannot afford to turn away from a player who has
a habit of making those who write him off look foolish. Also, with 16
goals to his credit, McCoist has scored more times for his country than
anyone else listed in the squad, and although the likes of Eoin Jess and
Scott Booth should by now be ready to edge the 33-year-old out of
contention for the European finals, he will not be making it easy for
anyone to take over.
''I would like to see Ally fit and scoring because, at his best, he
would be a threat in England,'' Brown said.
Jess, Billy McKinlay, and Scott Gemmill are likely to play from the
start against San Marino because the manager wants to give them the
chance to prove what they can do although they and others will be given
more chances in the friendly matches which are to be arranged before the
finals.
The Scots will play between three and four times at home and abroad --
there may be a tour to America and one of the matches could be against
Germany -- as Brown gets around to cutting his squad down to only those
who will go to England.
Jess, of course, has been playing in midfield for Aberdeen, but Brown
will be using him up front against San Marino.
Gary McAllister will start the game in midfield, but he is unlikely to
play the full game because Brown has agreed with Leeds United's manager
Howard Wilkinson that the player should be shown some consideration
because he will have played eight games in little more than 20 days.
Brown and Wilkinson were at odds when the Scots played a friendly match
in Sweden last month and the captain was injured.
''How long Gary will be on against San Marino will be decided between
him and his manager. I am always willing to help and I will always
co-operate fully with managers at times like this, but if this was a
game from which we needed the points then I wouldn't be doing any deals
with anyone,'' Brown said.
Nevertheless, he could find himself in trouble if a handful of
managers with players in the squad contact him asking for their people
to be treated lightly. The squad:
Booth (Aberdeen), Boyd (Celtic), Burley (Chelsea), Calderwood
(Tottenham), Collins (Celtic), Gemmill (Nottm Forest), Hendry
(Blackburn), Jackson (Hibs), Jess (Aberdeen), Leighton (Hibs),
McAllister (Leeds), McCall (Rangers), McCoist (Rangers), McGinlay
(Bolton), McKimmie (Aberdeen), T McKinlay (Celtic), B McKinlay
(Blackburn), McLaren (Rangers), McStay (Celtic), Nevin (Tranmere),
Robertson (Hearts), Walker (Partick Thistle).
Scotland's Under-21 squad against San Marino at Firhill on Tuesday is:
Bollan (Rangers), Crawford (Raith Rovers), Dailly (Dundee Utd),
Donnelly (Celtic), Freedman (Crystal Palace), Gardiner (Hibs), Glass
(Aberdeen), Hamilton (Dundee), Handyside (Grimsby), Hannah (Dundee Utd),
Harper (Hibs), Kerr (Celtic), Liddell (Barnsley), McCann (Dundee),
McLaughlin (Celtic), McNamara (Celtic), McNiven (Oldham), Miller
(Rangers), Murray (Rangers), Pressley (Dundee United), Sheerin
(Southampton), Stillie (Aberdeen).

<TEXT>
ENGLISH rugby union will use football as its role model if the first
division clubs' blueprint for the future of the game is accepted by the
Rugby Football Union.
The English First Division Rugby Limited (EFDR) yesterday presented
their report on the future of the game -- two days ahead of the RFU
commission's plans.
EFDR are demanding contracts for players, with transfer fees for those
switching clubs. Money from TV rights and sponsorship should be shared
equally within the members of the League. They advocate a system whereby
clubs doing well in cup competitions would be paid ''a success fee.''
The 10 first division clubs, who believe they need #1m per season to
run successfully, also insist that European competition must include
England next season.
EFDR recommend that the Five Nations Championship be pushed to the end
of the season -- played on consecutive Saturdays -- and they also
propose an expansion of the season from the traditional September-April
period.
Former England captain Peter Wheeler, chairman of EFDR, said: ''The
game has to be administered professionally otherwise someone will come
and take it away.'' The document has been presented to the RFU
commission in time for it to consider the recommendations.
EFDR will follow football's example of a transfer deadline and expect
the current qualification period of 120 days to be removed completely.
* Niell Renton, John Kerr, and Mark McKenzie will make their debuts
for North and Midlands in the match against Western Samoa at McDiarmid
Park, Perth, on Tuesday (kick-off 7.30pm). Team:
Burns (Edinburgh Acads); Renton (Kirkcaldy), Rouse (Dundee HS FP),

Private medical insurance has become a priority for many people. Bill
Knox looks at the benefits they receive
THE apparent mushroom growth of private medical health insurance
schemes might seem to have taken place during the past few years, but
many of the schemes concerned have been in existence for several
decades.
''That comes as a surprise to many people now investigating the scene
for the first time with a view to joining a particular scheme,'' said
the Scottish manager of one of the largest companies involved.
''The choice and variety of schemes has never been wider. It also
comes as an equal surprise to many to learn that the main growth in new
members joining one or other of the schemes comes from married couples
with young families.
''Quite simply, they have decided that private medical insurance is to
be one of their priorities as a household. If that decision means
perhaps less money to spend on some other family areas, like holidays or
general lifestyle, then that is totally accepted.
''And don't make the mistake of thinking that these new private
registration people have plenty of financial ''slack' available in their
budgets. They are people making what they see as a necessary investment
for their future.''
Today's private medical insurance battalions also include many whose
membership is part of a package of employment benefits, including many
union-negotiated agreements as well as individual schemes covering staff
and offered by a wide variety of firms large and small.
''But it comes as a surprise to many of these workers to discover,
when need arises, that the same private medical insurance benefits can
often cover spouse and sometimes children,'' said the London-based
spokesman for another insurance company which covers many joint employer
and trade union membership groups.
''It may seem a very sweeping statement, but private medical cover is
now a goal for more and more people of all ages in all occupations --
and the industry has begun expanding the range of ways in which it can
offer various degrees of cover at sliding costs to meet that demand.''
Private health cover now includes some packages tailored for new
pensioner customers aged over sixty, with no upper age limit for
joining. The choice of cover can include an immediate eligibility for
private treatment. Another a lower-cost option which guarantees that no
customer need wait more than six weeks for treatment.
If NHS facilities in the member's health region have a waiting list
exceeding that time, private treatment is then available with full cover
for hospital charges and specialist fees.
Some schemes now offer guaranteed acceptance with no medical required.
Customers aged over sixty also receive basic tax relief on premiums
''even if you don't pay tax''.
In the case of a married couple, only one partner has to be over sixty
to be eligible for tax relief on the whole premium.
But the private health insurance net has spread out in other
directions, regardless of age. Individual policies, some costing a
weekly premium which is less than the price of a daily newspaper, offer
specialised fixed cash benefit payments for either dental treatment,
optical requirements, or physiotherapy treatments.
A cost table prepared for The Herald by one major health insurer, and
including IPT at 2.5%, lists its main care rating for a single person
aged 25 as beginning at #37.01 per month.
For a family of four, the adults aged 40, that rises to #lO2.5l per
month, and for a retired couple aged 65 that becomes #l36.73 per month.
For comparison, the same company offers what it describes as local
care, meaning care based on one local private hospital, at respectively
#l9.40, #68.l4 and #88.66.
A third category, labelled esssential care is a tailored package which
excludes covering the costs of seeing a specialist privately before or
after a hospital stay.
Example prices in the same categories become #18.7l, #58.60 and #75.45
per month.
''The most important single piece of advice I could give to anyone,
whatever their age or family circumstance, would come down to spending
time in studying the small print,'' said a Glasgow insurance broker who
has seen a steady increase in inquiries concerning the wide range of
cover now available, a variety still growing throughout the sector.
''It is important that obtaining private health insurance be treated
in the same way as any other investment. It deserves study. The study
should begin with deciding exactly what kind of cover the customer and
their family would like to acquire, then should go on from there to
include seeking information about what would be provided by any of the
policies on offer.
''The amount of benefit available for hospital charges varies, and so
do actual hospital charges. It makes sense to find out what these
charges might be. Different policies offer subscribers different maximum
levels of benefit for various treatments.
''Accomodation, nursing and theatre charges are likely to be covered
within scale limits. But some insurance companies divide actual
procedures required into precise categories. An operation, for instance,
can be classsed as minor, intermediate, major, major plus or complex
major according to fee scales.
''Other scales can cover physician's services per day, oncology
including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and list charges for day-case
treatments and what is allowed for home nursing visits.
''In general, benefits are not payable for treatment required for any
known pre-existing condition, or for treatment required for pregnancy or
childbirth.
''But because of the way in which individual policies can vary in
their offered cover, the best advice always has to be to study what any
particular policy offers, compare it with what else is available, and
don't rush into a decision.''
With most major insurance companies now firmly established in the
private health market, many with a variety of insurance plans, the
advice to read the small print of what is on offer has never been more
relevant.
Today's health insurance world is backed by complex
computer-controlled organisations which still put much effort into
remembering that they are dealing with that most important of human
areas, a family's health needs, where individual customer care has to be
much more than a useful slogan.
In the same way, individual companies are expanding their interests
into general health maintenance. Customers may receive in-house
magazines offering health advice or helpful exercise programmes and
general medical guidance tips.
Special offers abound for programmes of arranged health checks. Policy
extensions covering overseas holiday health risks and much more are
offered.
''People have never been more aware of the importance of maintaining
good health than they are today,'' said a Scottish medical expert who
advises one major company.
''They should make sure they are equally aware of what their own
particular private health insurance scheme does cover, whether it is an
individual or a group policy. If they have any doubt, they should seek
advice and it is often possible to amend or add to a policy if that is
required.
''Private health insurance can bring its own sense of wellbeing, even
if you never have to use it. As an example, BUPA on its own, one of the
largest groups in the private sector, now protects around three million
people in the UK alone and pays out around #2.5m in benefits each
working day.
''These are people who have made a choice, and they are being joined
by more and more people each week.''

What we need now is a bit of stability at the club and I am satisfied
with the squad we have assembled. It is now up to the players to show
they want to be part of what we are trying to achieve at Tannadice.
BILLY KIRKWOOD
DUNDEE United manager Billy Kirkwood last night made it clear the
Tannadice spending spree is over -- despite the upset of having lost 5-4
on penalties to second division side Stenhousemuir in the final of the
Challenge Cup on Sunday.
But Kirkwood also emphasised that there would be no more big-money
departures for the club despite the fact that winger Andy McLaren has
been linked with Celtic.
Kirkwood has spent #2.3m on new players and brought in #3.6m by
selling others in a remarkable personnel shake-up since he took over
from Ivan Golac last season.
The fact that it was his rebuilt squad which lost to Terry Christie's
men made it an even more bitter pill to swallow.
''What we need now is a bit of stability at the club and I am
satisfied with the squad we have assembled,'' said Kirkwood.
''It is now up to the players to show they want to be part of what we
are trying to achieve at Tannadice.
''I am not going to be looking for any further players arriving here
-- and, equally, there will be none leaving.
''We were upset that a newspaper ran a story on the morning of a final
relating to a phone call which had taken place weeks earlier regarding
Andy McLaren.
''There was no more than an inquiry from Celtic and the player has
been told he is going nowhere until myself and the directors decide
otherwise.''
The United manager also revealed that he had called his players
together for a post-mortem of the Stenhousemuir defeat -- and left them
in no doubt that the club cannot afford repeat performances as they
chase promotion.
''We expect players to reach a level within a team set-up and that
just didn't happen for too many of them at Perth,'' said Kirkwood.
''It was as poor a performance as the one which cost us defeat at
Dumbarton in the league.
''I am not taking any credit away from Stenhousemuir but the fact is
we cannot afford to produce this kind of thing in future. It has been
happening in one out of five games with Dundee United for far too long
and it has to stop.
''We went on a run of four wins after Dumbarton and the players earned
a lot of praise for their efforts in stringing together those results. I
hope they read the papers and now realise the damage that has been done.
''The message has to be that the players have to work hard for
anything they get out of this game. That doesn't guarantee anything --
but it is a start.''
Rab Shannon and new signing Ray McKinnon took knocks against
Stenhousemuir and it is too early to assess their chances of being fit
to face St Mirren on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the champagne lifestyle came to an abrupt halt for Christie
yesterday morning.
He celebrated Stenhousemuir's first trophy win in 111 years on Sunday
night after their surprise win.
''But now, it's business as usual,'' said the school headmaster. ''I
enjoyed the moment, but it was back to work as usual.
''The schoolwork had to come first -- you can't keep the pupils
waiting.''
Christie and his Warriors did a lap of honour round McDiarmid Park
following their victory.
And it could be that big-time clubs are poised to move for talented
youngster Gareth Hutchison.
It was thought that the final would turn out to be a farewell
performance with Celtic leading a queue of clubs.
However, Christie added: ''There have been no definite bids. I thought
he did well against United, but he has played better.
''Naturally, I am delighted to keep him as long as possible, but the
lad knows we won't stand in his way.
''He's got loads of ability and he'll score goals in any company.''

THREE successive premier-division defeats have left doubts swirling
around Fir Park, and unless Motherwell quickly rediscover their belief
in the passing game which manager Alex McLeish has been trying to
foster, the run of woe will have been extended to four matches before
this day is over.
Satellite television have chosen the Lanarkshire side's home game
against Hearts for live transmission, but the cameras could be regarded
as prying eyes anxious to look in on Motherwell's grief. On the strength
of their most recent encounters, they are not yet ready for widespread
exposure.
However, McLeish remains defiant and he has been urging his players to
forget defeats by Hibernian, Partick Thistle, and Celtic and believes
there is not much wrong with his side which a good win couldn't put
right. He is aware, though, that more positive action must soon be
taken.
''We have got to turn he corner soon,'' he said. ''There is still a
good spirit among the players and they know this is a big game for us.''
McLeish has been hampered by injuries so far this season, but he is
not the only manager suffering in this respect and has no wish to search
for excuses. Besides, his players should have done much more than they
have to prevent themselves from slipping into the bottom area of the
premier division, where life can become extremely difficult and cruel.
Their 2-0 defeat by Celtic left them in third-bottom place with 10
points, the same number as Thistle and only two ahead of Falkirk, who
are in last place. McLeish bemoaned the fact that his players conceded
the midfield zones to Celtic, and if they are as foolish again this
evening they would be in real danger of losing again.
McLeish will be without Eddie May and Tommy Coyne, but Miodrag
Krivokapic might be ready to return. A 19-year-old, Greig Denham, might
also be considered.
Hearts, after some dreadful performances, looked much better on
Saturday when they beat Thistle 3-0, and the three foreigners who seem
to have injected fresh life into the Tynecastle side will play again
tonight.
The manager, Jim Jefferies, still has to decide if the Swede, Hans
Eskillson, who scored on his debut on Saturday, will be on the bench
again or play from the start.
Gilles Rousset, Hearts' French keeper, and their Italian defender,
Pasquale Bruno, will be among the first chosen, and Jefferies said:
''Saturday lifted us off the bottom and now we have to keep moving up,
but we are on a high while Motherwell might feel most of the pressure is
on them.
''In the bottom part of the league you have to try to live off one
another's vulnerabilities.''
Explaining the logic behind wishing to sign players like Eskillson,
who appears to be no more than an enthusiastic and powerful player, and
Bruno, who has been trying without a great deal of success to find a
club outside his own country, the manager said: ''The financial position
in which Hearts find themselves means that, for the next two years or
so, I will have to get the team through any way I can until we reach the
day when money is available for players.
''In the two outfield players we have taken on, one is technically
gifted and the other is someone whose style lifts the crowd.''
Although Rousset has signed until the end of his season, Jefferies
will be negotiating further with Bruno and Eskilson, who are commited to
only three games, the second of which will be played tonight.

* THE Dutch football association (KNVB) said yesterday that it stuck
by its decision to suspend referee Dick Jol over allegations that he bet
on matches he himself was refereeing.
Lawyers for Jol have dismissed the allegations and told Dutch
television that he was considering taking legal action as the KNVB had
failed to respond to requests to let him see the evidence on which it
based its suspension.
The KNVB struck Jol off its list of official referees last week,
saying he was under suspicion of having placed illegal bets on games
under his control.

Nottingham Forest 4,
Wimbledon 1
VINNIE Jones was ordered off last night as Wimbledon slumped to their
seventh defeat in the Premiership against Nottingham Forest at the City
Ground.
This was the tenth dismissal of the Wimbledon player's career, last
night's coming after Jones had made two blatant acts of foolishness,
firstly when he appeared to bad mouth a linesman and the referee, and
then when he blocked Bryan Roy with a shoulder.
Forest won the match in a canter, with goals by Roy, Stuart Pearce,
Jason Lee, and Scot Gemmill after Jones had equalised with his first
goal of the season.
Forest, unbeaten at home since January, moved into third place in the
league table on goal difference above Arsenal but passed up the chance
of a real spree against 10 men in the second half.
Roy back-heeled Forest into the lead after just eight minutes, then
Jones brought Wimbledon level three minutes later.
Forest regained the advantage when captain Stuart Pearce scored with a
drive just after the half-hour mark, and two minutes after the break,
Jason Lee scored his sixth goal of the season and his side's third.
With three minutes remaining, Scot Gemmill, named yesterday by
Scotland manager Craig Brown for the European Championship qualifying
match against San Marino next week, scored to put the seal on Forest's
success.
Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear, known to tell it like he sees it as
regards referees, was at it again, describing last night's official,
Paul Alcock, as ''disgraceful, very, very poor, dreadful'' following
Jones's sending-off.
''I've been campaigning for months but I think it is about time the
Referees' Association did something about it,'' said the manager.
''This is the fifth time this season we've finished with 10 men and
things are just getting worse and worse for us. It is getting tougher
all the time.''
Even Forest manager Frank Clark was surprised by the free-kick which
came after Jones' booking. ''My players were also surprised and I think
the best word to describe it is unusual,'' he said. ''But I've seen it
happen before.
''It always spoils a game when somebody is sent off but I can't
complain about my team's performance.''

ABERDEEN manager Roy Aitken, who moved Eoin Jess from his striking
role to midfield and revived his career, said yesterday: ''He obviously
had more to offer than he had delivered over the past couple of years
and I told him that.
''He'd taken a bit of flak and needed to examine himself closely to
see where he had gone off the rails.
''I wanted him more on the ball, dictating play. Good players can
adapt to other positions but in Jess' case the question was whether he
could be more disciplined off the ball.
''I wasn't looking for him to make crunching tackles. But he had to
take more responsibility and do the other chores such as closing down
opponents. This he has done and is now playing as well as he has ever
done.
''Indeed, he is performing as well as any midfield player in the
country and fully deserves his place in the Scotland squad. For it is
players who make players -- not managers. We only fine tune them.
''He has also provided another option for Craig Brown as he can still
be used as a striker if necessary.''
Meanwhile, Aitken will put his players on trial to find a winning
formula.
The Pittodrie club has lost five of their eleven league games to
falter by 12 points in a title race.
Now the manager is determined to halt the slide -- starting with
tomorrow night's home match against Falkirk.
He insisted: ''I need players to go in where it hurts, both to stop
goals and score them.
''We have shown this ruthless streak at times this season -- our run
in the Coca-Cola Cup is the perfect example. But the players must give
this little bit extra on a regular basis.''

IN ENGLAND
ALEX Ferguson, who begins his tenth year as manager of Manchester
United today, can look back on a record which outshines any of his
predecessors over a similar period.
In nine years, Ferguson has won two premier league titles, the FA Cup
twice, the European Cup-winners' Cup, and the League Cup.
But the Premiership's most successful manager knows he has a long way
to go before he can emulate the man he most admired, the late Sir Matt
Busby.
''I have always regarded myself as guardian of what Sir Matt developed
and built in the club. I have to protect that,'' said Ferguson.
''The first nine years have been eventful, to say the least. You don't
know where the time goes. I feel it's been a fulfilling spell and I have
enjoyed it. It is a wonderful club to work for. The supporters
absolutely amaze me time and time again.
''They have this persistence that Manchester United is a different
type of club. They want to guard that reputation and it is something you
grow into when you get to the club.''
In his first nine years, Sir Matt won the FA Cup in 1948 and the
championship in 1952. He went on to capture four further championships
together with the European Cup and FA Cup before retiring in 1969.
Under Ferguson, United have won 182 of their 363 league games and have
lost just 76. They have reached six Wembley finals and need only 22 more
wins to take them to 500 victories in all major competitions under his
management.

DIEGO Maradona gave a command performance in the most unusual arena of
his entire career last night. The 35-year-old Argentinian ace was the
guest speaker at a special meeting staged by the famous Oxford Union
Debating Society.
The auditorium, which has become the traditional gateway to the
corridors of power, was packed with 600 people.
Such was the demand to see the man who returned to football in
September after a 15-month ban imposed after a positive drug test during
the 1994 World Cup that the event did not get underway until 50 minutes
after the scheduled 8.30pm kick-off time.
But the rousing reception he received from the gathering of the latest
crop of bright young ones in the city of dreaming spires showed that
memories, in Oxford at least, of the infamous 1986 'Hand of God'
incident which controversially knocked Bobby Robson's England out of the
World Cup had been dimmed.
Maradona, in a smart suit and sporting one blonde streak in his hair,
gave a passionate lecture, talking about his rise from a shanty town on
the outskirts of Buenos Aires to the centre of the world stage. And he
made it clear that his experiences at the hands of the businessmen now
running the game necessitated his formation earlier this year of an
international players' union.
After his 50-minute lecture, Maradona answered questions from the
student audience including those about that famous game in the Azteca
Stadium in 1986.
The question about the first goal, when his left hand propelled the
ball beyond Peter Shilton, was shrugged aside. ''At the time it cured
everything,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Distributors slam OP dip recommendations</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>COLIN LEY</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
THE recommendation that organophosphorous (OP) dips should in future
be made available to farmers on a prescription-only basis has been
slammed by the Animal Health Distributors' Association as an
''outrageous and unjustifiable'' proposal.
The association was reacting to a report from the House of Commons'
Agriculture Select Committee which included the recommendation that OP
dips, viewed by many as vital to achieve effective control of sheep
scab, be placed on the Prescrition Only Medicines (POM) list.
''This is a very distressing recommendation,'' said Dr Roger Dawson,
chief executive of AHDA. ''It is also a completely wrong reaction to the
health and safety issues which have grown up around the use of these
dips.''
The AHDA argument is that animal medicines should be given a POM
classification only when a vet always has to be involved in
administering the medicine or only when precise prior diagnosis is
required, neither of which factors apply to OP dips.
''There can be no justification for making OP dips prescription-only
as they are routinely used for flock management purposes on the
initiative of the farmer, not the vet,'' said Dr Dawson. ''That is, of
course, unless OP dips are also to be administered only by vets in
future, for example by the vet dipping the sheep himself which is
clearly a ridiculous option.''
Scottish NFU animal health and welfare convener George Lyon also came
out strongly against the recommendation, claiming that it could make the
whole process of using OP dips much more complex for farmers and would
almost certainly make the products more expensive.
''Farmers can already only purchase OP dips if they have a Certificate
of Competence and that should be safeguard enough,'' said Mr Lyon. ''I
would definitely not wish to see them being shifted on to the POM
list.''
The convener added that many farmers had already been put off the use
of OP dips by the long-running safety debate and that, as a result, the
country was currently experiencing an explosion of sheep scab.
''OP dips have been shown to the be most effective means of
controlling scab,'' he said. ''We need to use them and under the current
Certificate of Competence arrangements I am confident they can be used
safely.''
Dr Dawson agreed that to change the supply route for OP dips, as
detailed in the Select Committee's recommendation, would create a
monopoly supplier and would increase the cost of the product to farmers.
''It would surely be far better to concentrate our efforts on ensuring
that the user of OP dips, not the buyer, is properly trained and
qualified to use the products safely,'' he said. ''That may mean
becoming more active in enforcing the Certificate of Competence
regulations but it must not result in the listing of OP dips as a POM
product.''

SCIENTISTS at the Scottish Agricultural College in Aberdeen have been
pleased with the success of trial plots of hemp grown in Aberdeenshire
and Morayshire this year -- despite problems caused by mistaken
identity.
Some of the hemp plants, part of the cannabis family, were picked by
passers-by until they discovered that it was not suitable for illicit
purposes.
''We harvested earlier than expected, at the very end of August, and
the results look promising, with yields of up to eight tonnes dry matter
per hectare,'' said SAC agronomist Dick Taylor.
The college has been growing hemp on licence from the Home Office for
two years and Dr Taylor believes the fibre, which can be used for
paper-making, fabric and animal bedding, will find a place on some
farms.
''This is a genuine industrial, non-food crop which attracts large
area payments and can be grown on set-aside,'' he said. ''Hemp is not
prone to pests and diseases so it would be a genuine break crop. Once we
get certain parts of the agronomy sorted out -- better varieties
particularly -- then I think it will be an attractive crop in this
area.''
The crop, which grows to a height of four metres, does not appear to
come to much harm if left in the field -- a bonus in this year's late
harvest weather. Harvesting procedure is swathing, followed by time to
dry and then baling. Extraction of the fibre thereafter is described as
''not as difficult as flax''.
SAC Aberdeen's industrial crops specialist Dr Kerr Walker said: ''Of
all the new crops we've tried recently hemp is one of the most
promising. At the moment papermakers are importing hemp but here we have
something that could be grown on Scottish farms to fill the gap.''

Young Perpetual trophy for the champion.
He had earlier won the Alderslade Cup for the double-furrow hydraulic
work for tractor ploughs.
Placed reserve out of the 46 entries on the field was Robert
McDairmant of West Bowhill, Annan, who collected the Robert Irving
Memorial Trophy. He also won the Mouswald Banks Cup for the two and
three-furrow reversible plough class with his son Gary beaten into
second place, although Garry won the award for the best opening.
William Gordon of Windon, Shieldhill Road, Lockerbie, who won the
vintage ploughing championship two weeks ago, turned to the more modern
tractors and won the Rosemount Cup for three furrows hydraulic tractor
ploughs.
In the vintage section a popular winner was David Kirkpatrick of Kedar

<HEADLINE>New strategy targets young drinkers and emerging overseas markets. United Distillers to invest #20m in Scottish maltings and distilleries</HEADLINE>

UNITED Distillers yesterday spelled out a strategy for boosting sales
of whisky and other spirits by focussing on younger consumers and
emerging overseas markets such as China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin
America.
The company, which forms part of the Guinness group, meanwhile
announced a #20m investment programme in Scottish maltings and
distilleries.
In September United Distillers became the first Scotch whisky company
to begin advertising on television in the UK. It launched a #2m campaign
to attract more young drinkers to its Bells blend.
Managing director Finn Johnsson told City analysts in London yesterday
the group would also continue a three-year-old campaign to target
drinkers in the 25-to-35 age group in the United States, which is United
Distillers' main overseas market.
Besides promoting its leading brands in such as Bells, Dewars and
Johnny Walker in their own right, United Distillers is going full steam
ahead with pilot schemes to market ready-mixed drinks.
In Australia for instance you can buy Johnny Walker and Coke in a can,
not to mention Bundaberg rum and Coke -- a concoction which the spin
doctors and stunned Aussie drinkers have nicknamed ''Dark and Stormy''.
Closer to home, United Distillers is test marketing a concoction of
Gordons' Gin, tonic and spices labelled Gin Zing in the East Midlands.
Mr Johnsson, a Swede who was appointed to revive the flagging fortunes
of United Distillers in February, said he was optmistic of an
improvement in pricing to end cut-throat discounting which has been
undermining the Scotch whisky industry for years.
''We hope to see steady improvement in prospects for pricing and are
committed to taking every opportunity open to us in this area,'' he
said.
''In particular, as competitive conditions allow, we will redirect
promotional spend into greater investment in brand building.''
Mr Johnsson said United Distillers was also committed to reducing its
cost base. Last September the group announced a #25m charge in to cover
the cost of reorganising its operations in Germany, Japan, USA,
Venezuela and Mexico.
Finally he said that from next year Guinness would provide separate
sales and pre-tax profit figures for beer and spirits with a breakdown
by geographical area.
Comparative figures for 1994 issued yesterday show high profit margins
on distilled products outwith the UK, where the margin was only 10.6%
compared to 22.6% in the rest of Europe and 28% in North America.
Profit margins on beer sales however were lowest in the USA and
Canada. The 5.6% profit margin on brewing activities in North America
compared to 10.6% in the UK and 13.8% in continental Europe.
In a separate announcement, United Distillers said yesterday it would
spend #20m on modernising its Scotch whisky distilleries and maltings
next year.
Of this, #7m will be spent on upgrading grain distilleries at Port
Dundas near Glasgow and Cameronbridge in Fife and #6m on developing
Burghead maltings near Elgin.
United Distillers will also spend #2m on improvements to Glen Ord
distillery in Muir of Ord, #1.5m on Mortlach distillery in Dufftown and
smaller sums on Cragganmore on Speyside, Lagavulin on Islay and Royal
Brackla near Nairn.
Guinness shares closed up 1p at 509p.
* WILLIAM Grant last night became the third Scotch whisky distiller to
promote its whisky on UK television.
United Distillers led the way for Bells in September. This was
followed by an Allied Distillers campaign for Teachers.
William Grant is spending #2.85m on a pre-Christmas advertising
campaign for its flagship Grant's Family Reserve blend.
But while the Bells adverts target young adults of both sexes who may
be newcomers to whisky, Grant seeks to win over established male Scotch
drinkers in the over 30s bracket.
The adverts focus on chunks of Scots dialect drawn from Burns, but it
doesn't really matter if the viewer hasn't a clue what ''Gars Your
Weason Fissle '' is all about. (The Grant's spokeswoman contacted by The
Herald didn't know either.)
One TV advert features a man trying to call his Granny from a payphone
to find out what ''Unco' sonsie'' means. But the pips go before she can
tell him it is ''very smooth''.

GARRY WESTON'S Associated British Foods took the City totally by
surprise by increasing full year pre-tax profits by 16% to #375m from
the on-going group which was about #20m above expectations thanks to a
sharp improvement in second-half operating results, writes ANDREW
WILSON.
The 1993-94 results included #58m from businesses now sold off.
The shares jumped 16p to 704p which added weight to the decision to
make a one-for-one scrip dividend to improve liquidity in the stock
which is 50.9% owned by Weston interests.
There is a second interim dividend of 4.5p which will be paid on the
doubled number of shares so that there is effectively a 9.4% increase in
the total payout from 16p to 17.5p for the existing shares. That puts
the shares on a 3.1% yield.
Manufacturing in the UK showed an encouraging turnround in Allied
Bakeries as the hefty rationalisation expenditure of recent years began
to make a positive impact with what is Britain's biggest bakery
operation (brands include Sunblest and Allinson) ending a five year
decline in profitability. That reflected in part some easing in the
price war and some of the sillier prices in supermarkets now a
phenomenon of the past.
However the Allied Mills flour business remained under pressure with
flour prices declining earlier in the year. But that was offset by the
British Sugar subsidiary improving its return by 10% to #184m helped by
exports carried over from the 1993-94 financial year.
Inevitably the hot summer had an adverse effect on biscuits and crisp
breads while European competition increased with new product lines being
introduced into the UK market.
However pressures from the supermarkets remains intense with the
battle for market share and rising supplier prices placing ABF in
something of a vice.
But there was some compensation from improved retailing where
operating profits in Britain and Ireland rose 17% to #55m on an 8% sales
advance to #1391m.
There was a similar turnover gain in Australasia but profits were
marginally lower at #31m.
Since September 16, UK sales have risen by about 4% but there has been
no improvement in margins.
Investment income managed to escape any nasty surprises in bond
prices, rising #48m to #69m on year end funds of #601m. The prior year's
results also showed a #23m gain on the revaluation of the stake in
Berisford.

SCHOOLS cricket was voted a hit yesterday when the Morrison Trust
extended its support of the sport.
The Trust is to boost the SCU's coffers by #25,000 over the next five
years, with all the cash going towards promoting cricket at schools
level.
Announcing the deal, Team Sport Scotland's cricket co-ordinator, Iain
Kennedy, said: ''This is terrific news for the game at grass-roots level
and a big vote of confidence for our existing policy of taking cricket
into primary schools throughout the country.''
The cash for cricket kids scheme has seen the number of children
playing the game double in the five years since the Morrison Trust first
offered its backing.
''We introduced an initiative in 1991 where clubs were encouraged to
adopt primary schools in their area,'' said Kennedy. ''It's been such a
success that the number of school children receiving top-level coaching
is now around 2500.''
One of the products of the scheme, Penicuik's teenage bowler John
Blain, became the youngest player to represent Scotland at B level last
season at just 16.

THE Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has promoted Iain McMillan
to succeed Lex Gold as its new director for Scotland, writes ROBERT
POWELL.
Mr McMillan, 44, has been an assistant director of CBI Scotland for
the past two years, working at its head office in Glasgow.
Mr Gold, who helped forge a more independent and dynamic image for the
organisation over the last two years, announced during the summer that
he wanted to leave to pursue private business interests.
Before joining the Glasgow office, Mr McMillan worked as banker with
the TSB group, rising to become senior network planning manager for the
UK at its Birmingham headquarters.
In 1983 he was seconded to the Prince's Trust for two years to manage
its affairs in Scotland and northern England. He joined CBI Scotland in
1993.
Andrew Cubie, chairman of CBI Scotland, said: ''He brings to the job
senior management experience in business, an extensive knowledge of
public policy issues in Scotland, great enthusiasm and a good working
relationship with a wide range of institutions in Scotland.''
The CBI declined to say how much Mr McMillan would earn in his new
job.
But Alan Mitchell, an assistant director of CBI Scotland, said the
employers' organisation had been responsive to criticisms that his
predecessor, who earned around #30,000, was underpaid.

NORWAY can claim more champions per head of its 4.3 million population
than any nation on earth. Thanks to a blindingly logical philosophy and
innovative methods rooted in a society in many ways similar to
Scotland's, it exerts a disproportionate influence on world sport.
DOUG GILLON visited the country to assess the facts, and observe what
lessons Scotland might learn.
In the first of a two-part series he poses the question: Norway -- a
better way?
DURING the oil crisis of the early seventies, the Storting, Norway's
parliament, decreed as a conservation measure that no cars be driven on
a Sunday.
This, you will appreciate, caused disruption to social and sporting
life. Not least to the late king, Olav V, whose pleasure it was to don
skis and join thousands of his countrymen in their regular Sabbath
recreation of soaring from the terrifying Holmenkollen ski jump which
hovers above Oslo.
Undaunted, King Olav emerged from his palace, skis over a shoulder.
Climbing aboard a tram with the masses, he dipped into the royal purse
to pay the car fare, and enjoyed his day's skiing.
This not only demonstrates the egalitarian nature of his nation's
society -- can you imagine Prince Charles on the London underground with
his polo stick, even minus pony? -- but also how seriously Norwegians
value sport and recreation.
The British, and Scots in particular, delude themselves about their
love of sport. Mostly this equates to sitting on their backsides,
watching live, or, increasingly, viewing TV's highjacking satellite
channels.
In Norway (population 4.3m) sport is a way of life. The country's 45
sports' governing bodies have 1.7m members, and more than 80% of all
people over the age of 15 take regular sport exercise.
Even their version of spectating is different. During last year's
Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, 25,000 Norwegians camped out overnight
in the snowy wilderness, in temperatures of minus-23, in order to watch
the following day.
Given the climate and their birthright, competitive excellence in ice
events is not surprising. But even when the Olympiad is staged in your
own country, it takes something very special for such a tiny nation to
win more medals than any other.
In Lillehammer, Norway's tally of 26 medals (10 gold, 11 silver, 5
bronze) beat that of every other country. Russia topped them on the
official table by virtue of 11 golds, but collected only 23 medals
overall.
At the 1992 Barcelona Games, Norway was fourth in terms of medals per
head of population, with gold in wrestling and sailing, and silvers in
rowing, canoeing, handball, and shooting. Taking their summer and winter
Olympic performances overall, they could justifiably claim to be the
world's best sporting nation.
Their men's football team achieved what neither Scotland, Northen
Ireland, or England could: they qualified for last year's World Cup
finals. And demonstrating why theirs is perhaps the country with the
greatest equality of the sexes, their women's soccer team this year won
the World Cup.
So how do they do it?
It is not just money. Though their government contributes #60m a year
-- more than six times what the UK Government provides to serve the
sporting needs of Scotland's 5.13m people via the Scottish Sports
Council -- an even more crucial difference is their lottery. It
disburses funds to help elite competitors prepare, whereas UK lottery
legislation bars this, specifying capital projects only.
The British Government consistently refuses to acknowledge that people
in a sport-conscious society are far less likely to eat, drink, or smoke
to excess. The benefits are a reduction in associated abuse-related
illnesses, with consequent vast savings in health care far outweighing
the money spent on sport.
Paul Glomsaker, deputy director, Department of Sport Policy at the
Norwegian Ministry of Culture, confirmed: ''There has always been wide
agreement here as to sport's health benefits, and we have the scientific
data to prove it is cost-effective. Health education is one reason why
it is easy for us to support sport.''
Most of this is under the banner of mass participation, under the
identical Sport For All slogan adopted in Scotland. But unlike here,
Norway's 141 champions and medallists are supported financially. Each
receives a Government stipend of 60,000 kroner a year -- a little more
than #6000.
Athletes like Geir Moen and Steinar Hoen, respectively European 200
metres and high jump champions, world javelin champion Trine Hattestad,
and big-earning skiers like World Cup overall champion Kjetil Andre
Amodt, and 1992 Olympic gold medallists Finn Christian Jagge (slalom)
and Ole-Christian Furuseth (giant slalom) now receive nothing. Any
sportsman or woman earning more than the national average of #22,000 a
year, forfeits the stipend.
The Norwegians also paid a #25,000 bonus for Olympic gold. But their
social conscience puts us to shame. Speed skater Johann Olav Koss, who
set world records to win Lillehammer titles at 1500, 5000, and 10,000m,
gave all #75,000 to the Olympic Solidarity Programme, which helps sport
in the Third World.
Yet 11 years ago, Norwegian sport was on the slide. In 1984, after a
decade of bad results, Thor Ole Rimejorde, project manager for
education, science, and special projects at the government-funded
Norwegian National Sports Centre, devised a new philosophy. The first
principle was that no results would be looked at for four years.
Rimejorde concluded that leading sports competitors were excessively
coach and trainer dependent, and that these mentors were too blinkered
-- thinking they could learn nothing from anyone else. So almost all
sports were brought together at the centre.
''Athletes just did what they were told, did not think for
themselves,'' says Rimejorde. ''First, we acknowledge the competitor is
the most important person. But as competitors, they have to take on
responsibility. They'd to realise that the way they think is the way
they behave.
''If you leave the responsibilities of your life to other people, then
accept what happens to you. If you want to succeed, take responsibility
for yourself.
''I arrived at this conclusion by looking at great performers. Whether
you are an artist, painter, or composer, or even walking to the North
Pole, you have to take on full responsibility -- nobody is out there to
help you.
''So the athletes learned to set goals for each and every day, and
that once a day has passed, they can never have it back.''
When Rimejorde presented these views to 400 US coaches before the
Lillehammer Olympics, he was almost thrown out of the lecture hall. The
coaches thought it meant losing control of their proteges. But the
arrogant Americans looked at him with new respect after their nation had
finished fifth, three places below Norway, with just 13 medals.
At the outset of his programme, Project '88, only nine of the 45
Norwegian sport governing bodies were in favour. But in 1988 and '89,
the system delivered 90 and 92 major championship medals respectively.
In 1990 there were 119 major medals, 146 in 1991, and 126 in '92. The
decrease reflects the fact that in Olympic years, many major world and
continental championships are not held. But in 1993, there were again
148 medals, and 170 last year. Significantly all but two sports of the
45 are now in favour of Project '88.
''We know it will not work for everyone,'' says Arne Myhrvold,
president of the Olympic committee and the Norwegian Confederation of
Sport. ''All we claim is that it works for us. It is devised for our
culture -- it would never work in Japan, for example. And it would not
work in America, because that country is so big. Sometimes there are
benefits in being small -- I believe that one place where it might work
is Scotland. We have a lot in common.''
The National Sports Centre, where Myhrvold and Rimejorde work, is
adjacent to the country's sports university. Only 3% of applicants are
accepted -- this in a land where four people in five go on to tertiary
education.
The vast centre, used daily by the likes of Hoen and Moen, and double
Olympic Greco-Roman wrestling champion Jon Ronningen, has
state-of-the-art, computerised physiology and fitness equipment unseen
in Scotland: pressure plates linked to computers which show every ounce
of force exerted at each phase of Hoen's high jump, for example. ''The
centre is not just open 9.00 to 5.00,'' says Hoen. ''If I am going
somewhere, and need to train, even at midnight, it's available.''
An indoor sprint track, with photo electric cells every five metres,
provide print-outs with time splits for every five metres as Moen hones
his technique, and unique weight-training equipment has been developed
for Ronningen.
The bill is footed from #20m given annually to the Olympic committee
by the Norwegian Government. The BOA gets less than nothing from its UK
counterpart --all activities are subject to VAT and corporation tax.
In the university physiology lab, near an inclined treadmill capable
of taking two racing cross-country skiers abrest, flat out, while wired
to monitors, is one of the world's most sophisticated test chambers.
Altitudes up to 25,000ft can be simulted, and in it stands a treadmill
on which athletes can run at up to almost 20mph, electing whether to
switch on a headwind of up to eight metres per second, and in any
temperature from minus-22 to 40 degrees Centigrade, with up to 90%
humidity.
It may sound like hell on earth, but there is little wonder that
sportsmen and women in Norway believe they have found paradise.

HOCKEY
SINCE having arrived in Scotland from Australia seven months ago
Scotland's first director of hockey, Brent Deans, has already begun to
change the face of the sport. But his greatest impact may still to be
applied.
Deans has accepted the post of coach to the senior men's team in an
attempt to improve their ailing fortunes after sinking to tenth place,
their worst classification, at the finals of the European Nations Cup,
in Dublin last August.
Many of the team's frailties were chronicled before the team left for
Ireland, so Deans faces a difficult task in salvaging some embers of
that side and dovetailing them along with the crop of young prospects
currently emerging into a functional unit for the preliminary round in
the World Cup next October.
Derek Forsyth will remain in charge of the under-21 side, Mike Gilbert
steps up from the women's under-21s to the senior post vacated by the
retirement of Neil Menzies, while Wendy Fraser will take over from
Gilbert. Appointments:
Men -- Seniors: manager, Alistair Tait; coach, Brent Deans; selector
Dougie Potter. U-21: manager, Harry Coles; coach Derek Forsyth. U-18:
manager Allan McGill; coach Gavin Fraser. U-16: manager, Keith Joss;
coach, Brian McCartney; selector, Gerry Ralph.
Women -- Seniors: manager, Lynda McFadyen; coach, Mike Gilbert. U-21:
manager Marjory Coutts; coach, Wendy Fraser; selector, Alison Ramsay.
U-18: manager Marjory Coutts; coach, Wendy Fraser. U-16: manager, Kate
Haldane; coach, Jacqui Lothian; selector, Marietta Craigie.

THERE are two nice wee boys who live up the road, one a ferocious
Rangers fan, the other dedicated to Celtic.
Neither was in his usual chirpy form last week but, as wee boys do,
they will bounce back. They will soon be beating their chests in
self-delusion, as wee boys do, about how their teams are the greatest
and, as wee boys do, will pop off to sleep at night dreaming that one
day they may wear one or other shirt.
It is a scenario that dates back most of this century and will not
disappear in their lifetimes, yet the brutal truth is that their
favourite clubs seem determined to set course on a policy that would
give them as much chance of playing for the Old Firm as setting foot on
the moon.
Rangers' determined pursuit of the abolition of the three-foreigner
rule, as dictated by UEFA, is laudable in many ways, not least the
possibility that it would give small nations a better chance of
competing with the major countries in European competition, but the
ramifications of success in their petition perhaps are greater than even
they may have contemplated.
Already, since the advent of the Graeme Souness era at Ibrox, when
fine players from England initially and then elsewhere, were brought to
Scotland, it has become almost impossible for young Scottish players to
break through into the top team on a regular basis.
Rangers might argue reasonably that only a few were good enough but in
the long term, the psychological effect upon people like the wee Rangers
fan up the road has to be negative.
If in his mind my little friend sees a team dominated by names like
Laudrup, Gascoigne, Salenko et al, he might well subconsciously decide
that supporting rather than playing is the only way to go to Ibrox.
There was a point during the Souness reign when it was difficult to
spot a Scot -- even Ally was left out -- and, although in Walter Smith's
time there has been a greater tartan contribution, that was due to the
need to have home players for European competition.
If Donald Findlay's persuasive tongue can bring about a movement that
succeeds in removing the foreigner rule in UEFA matches, then the
incentive for embryo Rangers players to try to make it at Ibrox would
become miniscule.
Inevitably, as any manager in the circumstances would do, Smith would
use his spending power to the full and a Rangers side might well contain
nine, 10, or even the full monte, of players from beyond the boundaries
of Scotland.
The position then would be that the most powerful team in the country,
the team that the great majority of Scottish boys want to join, would
become a melange of foreign stars. As Celtic have apparently lent their
backing to Findlay they, too, might be forced by economic necessity to
compete in that market place rather than pursue resolutely the course
currently preferred by their manager.
Smith would rather see a graded system of permitted foreigners,
allowing the smaller countries more players from abroad than the bigger
countries, but it is hard to see how that could be practicable.
Without that sophistication, the possibility that the new freedom
would open doors for teams like Rangers to do better in the high
echelons of Europe seems remote. Removal of the foreigner rule would
merely let Italy, Spain, and Germany buy all the major stars of every
nationality and leave the rest competing for the second tier players,
with the net result not so very diferent from today.
It may be an old-fashioned notion, that Rangers and Celtic ought to
represent what is best in Scotland and take their chances on that basis,
but at least it allows wee boys to dream.
Chasing a mirage never did anybody much good.

CRICKET
THE West Indies usually settle for four fast bowlers, so with this in
mind England's batsmen look set to face the hottest pace attack in world
cricket after the South Africans yesterday named five quickies for next
week's opening Test at Centurion Park, Pretoria.
The first appearance of 22-year-old Shaun Pollock in a senior squad
completes a nap hand completed by Allan Donald, Brett Schultz, Craig
Matthews, and Brian McMillan.
Donald is well known after his good work for Warwickshire. And
Matthews and McMillan impressed during last year's tour of England.
But Schultz, a left-armer who is arguably quickest of the lot, and
young Pollock -- who includes Malcolm Marshall among his fans -- are
unknown quantities to Mike Atherton and company.
The introductions will be made on Thursday week, unless a ground never
before used for Test cricket produces a pitch more susceptible to spin
bowling than South Africa's selectors would like.
Their squad of 12 includes slow left-armer Clive Eksteen -- just in
case. But South African chairman of selectors, Peter Pollock, father of
Shaun, admits that Eksteen is only being taken along as cover.
In England last year, all-rounder McMillan was not trusted with a
top-six place, but his batting has improved so much that he can now move
one place up the order while continuing to bowl on the sharp side of
medium.
''We think it's a good attack,'' said Peter Pollock, ''but I'm not
about to make any big, bold claims by saying they are the best in the
world. It's not a question of whether you bowl fast or slow but how well
you bowl.''
The home side's batting line-up is as expected, with captain Hansie
Cronje having volunteered for the troublesome No.3 spot. The South
African squad is:
A C Hudson (Natal), G Kirsten (Western Province), W J Cronje (Orange
Free State, capt), D J Cullinan (Border), J N Rhodes (Natal), B M
McMillan (Western Province), D J Richardson (Eastern Province, wkt), S M
Pollock (Natal), C R Matthews (Western Province), A A Donald (Orange
Free State), B N Schultz (Eastern Province), C E Eksteen (Transvaal).
* ENGLAND A scored 279 for the loss of nine wickets in their tour
match against a Combined XI in Karachi yesterday. The home side had
scored 204 all out.

AMERICAN FOOTBALL
CLEVELAND Browns are set to become the latest NFL team to move states
following the announcement by Maryland Governor Parris Glendening that
the club would be playing in Baltimore next season.
''Ladies and gentlemen, we have a signed contract in hand. The Browns
are, indeed, coming to Baltimore,'' said Glendening while waving a
document in the air at a news conference in the parking lot outside
Camden Yards baseball stadium.
The announcement of a deal with Browns' owner Art Modell to shift the
franchise ends a 12-year absence of the NFL in Baltimore, whose Colts
were moved in 1984 to Indianapolis.
The deal brings the Browns a 30-year, rent-free lease in a new 70,000
seat, #132m stadium to be built at Camden Yards.
But lawyers for Cleveland have indicated that the franchise will not
be leaving the city.
Earlier, the city was granted a temporary court order to stop any move
by the Browns, who have played football in Cleveland since 1946.
A spokesman for the Common Pleas Court, a state court, said a
temporary restraining order was granted to halt the move until at least
November 20 at which time a full-fledged hearing on the request will be
held.
Meanwhile, so far as upsets go, they don't come much bigger than
Carolina Panthers' 13-7 humbling of the mighty San Francisco 49ers at
Candlestick Park on Sunday.
It is the first time an expansion team has beaten the reigning
Superbowl champions in the 76-year history of the National Football
League and the incomprehensible loss provided a new and worrying twist
for the 49ers' campaign, plagued with inconsistency since the start of
the season, ahead of the much-awaited rematch with arch-rivals Dallas
Cowboys this weekend. Week 10 results:
Atlanta 34, Detroit 22; Oakland 20, Cincinnati 17; Houston 37,
Cleveland 10; Kansas City 24, Washington 3; Minnesota 27, Green Bay 24;
New Orleans 19, St Louis 10; New England 20, NY Jets 7; Pittsburgh 37,
Chicago 34 (ot); Denver 38, Arizona 6; Buffalo 16, Indianapolis 10;
Seattle 30, NY Giants 28; Carolina 13, San Francisco 7; Miami 24, San
Diego 14.

PATIENTS at one private hospital in Glasgow have been assured of
quality and the highest standards after the institution was awarded a
clean bill of health by the country's main assessment body.
The Glasgow Nuffield Hospital is one of only three hospitals in
Britain in both the private and public sectors to receive full
accreditation from the King's Fund Organisational Audit. Since the
scheme began in June this year, 60 hospitals, including 18 NHS trusts,
have had their management and organisational systems scrutinised, and
the majority have been given provisional accreditation.
In the case of the Glasgow Nuffield, after a rigorous examination by
KFOA surveyors lasting several months, only two minor modifications to
procedures were needed before the hospital graduated with flying
colours.
Hospital manager, Reeta Deerin, said this success was a result of the
hard work and dedication of the 250 staff. ''We are extremely proud of
this achievement in being one of the only three UK hospitals to receive
full accreditation,'' she said. ''No healthcare providers are ever asked
to submit themselves to a more rigorous and testing scrutiny. Every one
of our staff must be congratulated for their efforts.''
Almost every aspect of the hospital's organisation is closely
monitored during the assessment. Hospital management, support services,
acute day care, medical services, nurisng, surgery, diagnostic, imaging,
pathology, pharmacy, physiotherapy, outpatient, services and radiology,
all come under the microscope.
This award consolidates the reputation for first-class health care
built by the Glasgow Nuffield since it opened in the city in 1974. It is
part of the UK's largest and oldest hospitals group, Nuffield Hospitals,
and is registered as a charity.
The KFOA also has an illustrious history, being an autonomous part of
the King's Fund which was set up in 1897 as an independent medical
charity by the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII. The parent
organisation has three other major arms. The Development Centre supports
innovations in the NHS; the Management College sets out training
initiatives for clinical, professional and management staff in
healthcare fields; and the Policy institute is an analytical body which
focuses on the analysis of medical research and healthcare policy in
general.
The Organisational Audit is used as a national standard for healthcare
assessment, its award being broadly equivalent to the British Standards
Institute's quality standard BS EN ISO 9002, which covers the
organisational and procedural systems in all types of companies. The
KFOA assessment criteria have been derived from international standards
in the healthcare sphere.
The King's Fund, as a charity, allocates annual grants of around #2m
to a wide range of projects deemed to add significantly to the quality
of healthcare provision.

AS far as handicapping goes, the St Andrews-based Ladies' Golf Union,
which represents 210,000 players in Britain and Ireland, have adopted a
policy which could be described as: ''If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.''
Their current system has no more than two years to run. This
trail-blazer may have been modified many times, but the principles set
out in 1893 by the founder, Issette Pearson, of Wimbledon Ladies,
remained intact. In that context the alteration under way amounts to a
minor revolution.
From an as yet unspecified date in 1997, the Union's members, of which
there are 35,000 in 400 clubs in Scotland, will adopt a system similar
to those which operate in the rest of the world.
That is not to say that their old one was inferior. The debate about
whether it was better or worse than the men's, the one in the USA, or
the one in Tierra del Fuego -- if they play golf there -- will have to
remain unresolved.
What has brought this about is that British and Irish women are
disadvantaged in international handicap competitions.
In general, LGU handicaps reflect the best performances of players
whereas others are a measure of current form.
The difference between the two, according to LGU administrator Elaine
Mackie, is three shots, a margin big enough to ensure home players are
defeated abroad unless they play out of their skins. It has caused no
end of trouble.
''We have decided that in this day and age when players are travelling
the world we want compatibility with those we compete against,'' said
Mackie.
Exactly how the new system will work is still under scrutiny by a team
of experts who claim to have examined every handicapping system over the
last 18 months, but some points are already clear.
It will be a form of the men's system in Britain and Ireland --
administered by the Council of National Golf Unions (CONGU) -- inasmuch
as every score will be used in the calculation and the assessment will
be ongoing. Variations of this system are used by women in most parts of
the world.
Women's handicaps are based on a player's best score or an average of
several of the better ones according to five categories. These will be
scrapped along with the biennial review of individual figures.
Mackie made it clear there are parts of the CONGU system which the LGU
do not wish to use, at least for the time being.
One is variable standard scratch whereby the base score of the day,
the competition scratch score (CSS), can go up or down according to the
performance of all competitors, a device intended to make allowances for
good or bad playing conditions.
A drawback is that CSS cannot be calculated until the last competitor
is off the course, with the result that early finishers may have to wait
until the next day -- or later depending on how quickly officials get
around to making this calculation -- to find out by how much their
handicaps have changed.
''We want our players to know how their handicaps stand after their
rounds have finished,'' said Mackie.
Another is that it will be simpler to operate and not require a
computer, an essential item of equipment in men's clubs of any great
size.
So far undecided are the logistics of transition. Whether all
handicaps will rise by three when the system is implemented or whether
that change will be allowed to happen gradually as scores are submitted
remains to be seen.
The Herald's experience of Parbusters scores confirms that women,
indeed, have their handicaps reduced more quickly than their real form
is improving.
Out of mischief the women's scores in this year's final at Haggs
Castle -- which were not out of the ordinary compared with the six
previous finals -- were put through the CONGU system and they went right
to the end of the scale.
Whereas the men's figure went up three from 72 to 75, the CSS still
counted for handicap rises. The women's went up three from 73 to 76 and
would have been a non-counter.
One final point: In this age of keen debate about equal rights for
women, why not take on the CONGU version lock, stock and barrel?
Handicapping is meant to allow players of widely differing abilities
to compete on a level footing in a way that other sports cannot, and
could allow men and women to do so -- but only if the method of
calculation is identical.
By tinkering with and changing the CONGU system, the LGU are ensuring
that truly mixed medals will remain a concept for the distant future.

ALTHOUGH Sam Torrance has had a recurrence of a pulled leg muscle, he
will partner Andrew Coltart for Scotland in the World Cup tournament,
which begins on Thursday at the Mission Hills club, in Shenzhen, South
China.
Indeed, unless the injury flares up again Torrance, 42, will fulfill a
gruelling season-end programme of travel and competition. He has four
tournaments to play after this week, in Hong Kong, Japan, Southern
Africa, and Jamaica.
On the other hand Ian Woosnam has withdrawn from Wales's team, to be
replaced by Phillip Price, 110th on the 1995 European money list. He
reportedly told his erst-while team-mate, Mark Mouland: ''You're better
off without me,'' after his 77 in the Alfred Dunhill Masters in Jakarta.
However, Woosnam discounted that score as his reason for pulling out.
He wanted to return home to consult a specialist over persistent back
trouble, originally incurred when he lifted the ample frame of
Costantino Rocca off the ground in the Ryder Cup celebrations.
Heineken, sponsors of the World Cup, are bound to be disappointed at
this latest weakening of the field. Those who never were going to take
part include Colin Montgomerie, Nick Faldo, Severiano Ballesteros, and
Jose-Maria Olazabal.

COULTON heads the weights for Saturday's Mackeson Gold Cup at

But the disappointment yesterday was that 24 horses were withdrawn at
the latest exit route.
Coulton will equal the weight carrying feat of Bradbury Star last year
if he can defy 12st at the weekend.
''He is in A1 condition,'' a stable spokeswoman said, ''and Jamie
Osborne takes the ride.''
Josh Gifford said of Bradbury Star: ''The horse has really blossomed
in the last few days and I think we will take our chance if the ground

The line-up also includes Egypt Mill Prince, about whom trainer Jenny

ONE Man, winner of last season's Hennessy Gold Cup, and Jodami,
successful in the Cheltenham Gold Cup of 1993, look set to line up for
the #15,000 Sean Graham Motherwell Chase at Ayr on Saturday.
There are 13 entries for the first running of this event, including
Whispering Steel, Commercial Artist, Cogent, and Mr Boston.
It will be One Man's first appearance of the season and his only
preparation for the defence of the Hennessy title at Newbury two weeks
later.
Trainer Gordon Richards said that One Man was ''ready to race and
barring accidents all geared up for Ayr.''
His plans for One Man include the two prinicpal chases of the jumps
season, the King George on Boxing Day and the Cheltenham Gold Cup.
Jodami is said by his trainer, Peter Beaumont, to be ''in good order
and in need of a race.''
After more than nine inches of rain in the West of Scotland in October
with more forecast, good going is guaranteed -- Ayr will probably be the
best available turf for jumping in the country -- and clerk of the
course, Sam Morshead, is confident of ''a great race.''
Morshead, who successfully lobbied the British Horseracing Board
planners to agree this top-class, three mile chase at Ayr, said: ''I
have always felt there was a gap for a race of this quality in the
North.''

IF Highers were awarded for managing change, how many companies do you
think would get an 'A'? For effort or enthusiasm, maybe . . . but on the
practical side, a good percentage would be fortunate to scrape a 'B' or
'C' for implementation.
In his 1970 classic Future Shock, Alvin Toffler observed: ''Change is
avalanching upon our heads and most people are grotesquely unprepared to
cope with it.'' It seems we still are. In the intervening 25 years only
the pace of change has increased exponentially.
Hardly a day goes past without news of corporate restructuring,
redundancies -- or downsizing as it's increasingly called -- mergers,
sell-offs and buy-ins. And to make matters worse, organisations that are
seriously interested in growing into the 21st century must deal
simultaneously with quantum leaps in technology, globalisation,
political upheaval, demographic change and growing environmental
concerns.
Today's reviewer is British Telecom's national manager for Scotland,
Bill Furness (left). He looks at a new book on change management which
is beginning to attract attention in business circles. His assessment
draws widely on his own experience of living through a period of
large-scale change.
CAN anyone doubt that managing major organisational change
successfully is the key management requirement of the 1990s? The
simplicity of this statement should not disguise its truth. Few
industries and public sector organisations in Scotland have escaped the
pressures arising from increasing competition and technological change.
My own company has shed 35% of its workforce (on a voluntary basis I
hasten to add) in the last five years and those that remain have had to
accept real changes to their working lives -- evening and weekend
working, flexible working arrangements and multi-skilling on
increasingly complex technical projects.
No wonder business leaders have searched for examples where
organisations have been able to achieve such transformations and retain
the enthusiasm and commitment of their shrinking workforces. And no
wonder that academics and consultants (a distinction that appears
increasingly dated) have rushed to record what has happened and package
the results for an eager and growing audience.
Learning into the Future* -- written by two experienced consultants
based at Ashridge Management Centre -- claims not only to draw from the
best of existing experience but also to offer a major new approach which
overcomes the weaknesses of past change models. How well does it do
this?
The authors' main argument is that most existing change management
programmes are ''top-down'', grouping under this label approaches such
as business process re-engineering, total quality management, continuous
improvement and culture change (incidentally, am I the only manager to
be increasingly irritated by such random groupings of initiatives
without respect for their differences, context and track records?).
These approaches are characterised by forceful, inspirational leaders
who force through change in their organisations.
By contrast bottom-up approaches (which in my experience are less
common than the authors suggest) release the desire and capability for
change in people within the organisation with the leader acting as
facilitator.
Both approaches -- it is suggested -- have their weaknesses: ''top
down'' imposes change and is insensitive to the traditional strengths of
the organisation whereas ''bottom-up'' encourages empowerment but lacks
direction by not tackling the critical issues facing the organisation.
Having set up their hypothesis, it came as no surprise to find that
the authors suggest a combination of the two approaches linking both
strong leadership and learning from what already exists in the
organisation -- listening to people's concerns and recognising what is
already done well. They develop their case well and make good use of
clear and straightforward examples drawn from their consulting
experience in a range of public and private sector organisations. But
does it add up to the ''ground-breaking study'' their publisher claims.
I am not convinced. I find their distinction between top-down and
bottom-up approaches unconvincing -- the real world is more complicated.
For example, there may well be senior executives who impose their
version of change insensitively on an unprepared and therefore
unreceptive workforce -- but I have not met many. My experience is far
more of chief executives performing a fine balancing act between trying
hard to win the hearts and minds of the workforce and generating
sufficient momentum to change quickly enough to survive.
Our experience in BT was that in the early stages of competition in
the industry we had a phoney war (if you will pardon the pun) when it
was difficult to convince the average employee that major changes to the
way they worked were essential.
Now that the reality of competition is biting, with over 150 companies
operating in the UK, our frontline customer service engineers have a
very direct and immediate experience of the effects of competitive
pressure. The need to change was there before many employees appreciated
the fact.
Similarly, my experience is that the ''bottom-up'' approach seldom
operates in the directionless manner suggested by the authors -- at
least not for very long. For example, when BT first introduced Tota
Quality Management into its operating divisions, small units were
encouraged to develop their own action plans within a total company
framework. Giving ownership to those directly involved generated early
commitment by many who might otherwise have been suspicious of another
management campaign.
My contention is that few organisations which seriously tackle change
slavishly follow what the authors term a ''top-down'' or ''bottom-up''
approach. Most move between the two -- change is a messy process.
Binney and Williams write clearly and attractively about current
change practices and offer excellent insights into how modern
organisations are tackling this difficult area. For me, however, it did
not add up to a major new approach that would cause companies to
radically rethink their change strategies.

THE biggest free newspaper offer in the history of the Scottish
newspaper trade will take place this Friday to mark the launch of a new
low-cost jet service between Glasgow and London-Luton.
EasyJet has agreed to buy the total circulation of The Herald's sister
paper, the Evening Times, to mark the occasion. It will involve 300,000
complimentary copies of the paper being distributed in West Central
Scotland.
Iain Forbes, managing director of Caledonian Newspapers, publisher of
the Evening Times and The Herald, described the ''bold initiative'' as a
great ''birthday bonus'' for easyJet, Evening Times' readers, and
advertisers.
He said it would enable the newspaper to demonstrate its full
promotional power in supporting a campaign.
Friday's Evening Times will contain a special eight-page supplement on
the new service between Glasgow and London-Luton. Twelve Evening Times
readers who won free tickets will be on the inaugural flight.
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, easyJet chairman, said: ''It is not every day in
your life that you launch an airline and Glasgow being our first
destination has sentimental value for us.
''For this reason we wanted to give a free gift to the people of
Glasgow and West Central Scotland. We look forward to serving and
getting to know the Evening Times readers over the coming years.''
John Scott, editor of the Evening Times, said the unique promotion
would provide a great opportunity for the paper to attract new readers.
He also argued that the introduction of the new flights would be
good for Glasgow. ''Anything that makes travelling between Glasgow and
London easier and cheaper is to be welcomed,'' he said.
The promotion, understood to be the first of its kind in Scotland and
only the second in the UK following the Microsoft deal with the Times in
London for the launch of Windows 95, will involve newsagents receiving
double their normal quota of the Evening Times. Vendors in Glasgow city
centre will also promote the special edition along with special teams in
shopping centres and retail parks.

<HEADLINE>Scottish exports retreat 3.5% in third quarter</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH exports fell further during the third quarter, marking a
further retreat from their peak at the end of 1994, the Scottish Council
Development and Industry (SCDI) said in a survey published today.
''The latest results confirm a slowdown in the rapid rate of growth
experienced by exporters in the past 18 months,'' said SCDI business
information manager Ian Armstrong.
The estimated value of Scottish exports fell 3.5% to #3600m between
July and September from #3730m in the second quarter, due mainly to
lower shipments of chemicals and computers.
However the survey showed a slight increase in exports of electronic
goods, paper products and food and drink items.
SCDI predicted that Scottish exports would recover to about #4130m
during the fourth quarter since sales of whisky and computers usually
receive a boost towards the end of the year.
But the organisation said this optimistic forecast should be treated
with caution since it had earlier predicted a recovery of exports in the
third quarter which failed to materialise.
The SCDI said this year's steady fall in Scottish exports must be
viewed in the context of a retreat from a record shipments of #4290m in
the last quarter of 1994.
''While the slowdown in growth is of some concern, the export
performance of Scotland's key industrial sectors continues at a high
level,'' Mr Armstrong said.
The SCDI is a private sector organisation financed by Scottish
companies, trade unions and local authorities which organises overseas
trade missions and publishes quarterly surveys of Scotland's export
performance.
These surveys are based on the value of goods shipped by 26 companies
representing all major sectors of the Scottish economy and about half of
all exports.
''The projected outlook for the fourth quarter is more encouraging
and, combined with the effect of seasonal trends, an increase in the
index seems likely,'' he added
The SCDI quarterly export index (base 1993) fell to 140.23 in the
third quarter from 145.10 in the second quarter, but was still up on
138.05 registered in the third quarter of 1994.

SUCCESS has grown from the potter's wheel for Scottish potter,
Griselda Hill (pictured right), who will officially open her first shop,
in Edinburgh, this week.
Wemyss Ware, a highly collectable Scottish pottery produced until 50
years ago, is back in fashion thanks to Griselda's faithful
reproductions, which are in increasing demand at home and abroad.
The earthenware cats, pigs, and tableware, have been given a new lease
of life by the Griselda Hill Pottery, based in the Fife hamlet of Ceres.
The shop, in the capital's Victoria Street was previously The Old
Curiosity Shop, and had one of the largest collections of Wemyss Ware in
the world.
Former owner Iris Fox has a Wemyss Ware collection estimated to be
worth over #1m.

<TEXT>
YET more competition in the general insurance market has been
signalled by Halifax's decision to start up a direct selling household
insurance business next year.
The news predictably sent composite insurance shares lower and Royal
Bank of Scotland shed 4p to 507p as it has obvious implications for
Direct Line.
However ,the move does not come as a great surprise given the
society's overall ambitions in personal finance, and the threat should
not be exaggerated. Halifax wants to get its direct banking service
fully up and running before it rolls out a general insurance business in
earnest and this will probably not be until the latter part of 1996.
The group already has an embryonic direct selling operation which will
brought to the attention of its one million current account customers
over the next few months. Feedback from this will be used to fine tune
the service.
Halifax has of course a massive customer base, with two million
borrowers and millions of savers. It currently provides household
insurance to borrowers through a panel of insurers and getting these
accounts into its own operation should be fairly easy. Extending it
beyond that will be more difficult.
There is the inertia factor, which will be increased by the likelihood
that loose customers will have been shaken out by the already keen
competition in the sector. In addition general insurance is a risky
business and Halifax will want to tread carefully given that it has a
learning curve to follow.
There has been a plethora of direct insurers starting up as the major
insurers selling through more traitional means have been pressured into
following Direct Line's lead. But more traditional distribution routes
have been fighting back and the direct writers are no longer having it
all their own way. However, news that such a powerful figure as the
Halifax is joining the crowd can only be good for consumers in keeping
pressure on rates.

ANOTHER week another bid for a regional electricity company. In this
latest round of musical chairs the music stopped with Central and South
West Corporation (CSW), capturing the prize of Seeboard. CSW has a good
acquisition in Seeboard which has been the top rated REC for some time.
The company offers the most value per share for National Grid, due to
the disproportionate shareholding it owns relative to its market
capitalisation.
In addition it is financially strong with zero gearing and is one of
the few RECs still profitably involved in electrical appliance retailing
and has growing gas interests. Shareholders have certainly been looked
after with the group paying generous dividends.
This latest bid has turned the spotlight even more brightly on the
four remaining RECs, London, East Midlands, Yorkshire and Northern.
Having previously demonstrated its desire to own a REC it cannot be out
of the question that US-based Houston Industries will put in the next
bid for one of the remaining RECS.
The UK RECs undoubtedly offer overseas bidders better value than they
could get in their domestic markets. Houston is certainly not short of
cash to mount a bid having sold its cable television interests to Time
Warner for $2200m ealier this year.
However, another multi-utility merger cannot be ruled out given the
Government's recent clearance of North West Water's bid for Norweb. Some
City analysts have suggested that Yorkshire Water could make a move on
Yorkshire Electricity, and Severn Trent could make an offer for East
Midland.
North West Water was adamant that substantial benefits would flow from
a multi-utility in terms of reationalisation savings and tax synergies,
with the potential for more rapid growth of non-regulated earnings than
would exist for either company alone.
However, Thames Water has very publicly ruled itself out of bidding
for London Electricity because it could see no value creation in the
deal for shareholders. What is certain is that the four remaining
independent RECS are unlikely to remain so for much longer.

A YEAR ago industrial production and its manufacturing component were
both sporting growth rates of 5% per annum and were boosting economic
activity to so hectic a pace that the monetary authorities (the Treasury
and the Bank of England) embarked on a policy of raising interest rates.
Now activity is growing at a snail's pace. Retail sales were lower in
September than in the same month a year ago. Production is barely rising
at 1% per annum, and only healthy growth in non-retail services is
keeping the econony ticking over at around its trend rate of growth.
Manufacturing is being hit by the sluggishness of final demand at home
and the slowdown in activity abroad, especially in the US.
In the highly competitive conditions which exist today companies are
unwilling to carry excess stocks for long, and both manufacturers and
retailers are cutting back on stocks built up when the economy began to
slow down.
This is the most likely explanation for the unexpectedly sharp fall in
manufacturing output in September. The quarterly figures suggest that
the clothing and textiles industries are being hardest hit.
They also show durable goods production fell by 0.2% between the
second and third quarters and non-durable goods by 0.6%. By contrast
both investment and intermediate goods industries made positive
contributions.
Consumers have had to cope with higher taxes in April, three
half-point increases in interest rates, and the distractions of the
National Lottery.
But the picture could change quickly. Whatever the Budget may bring,
it will be the first for three years not to increase taxes. Most pundits
expect a gradual return of consumer confidence, especially if the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, finds a safe way of giving
them some of their own money back through lower taxes.
The building societies have trimmed their mortgage rates to stimulate
the moribund housing market, even though the Chancellor himself has not
yet found it necessary to reduce base rates.
However, pressure is building up for Clarke to cut rates early in the
new year once his Budget is out of the way. But if the present slowdown
in activity proves to be no more than a mid-cycle pause for breath the
combination of lower taxes and rates in the spring could come at just
the wrong time for the economy. Governments have a good track record of
getting these things wrong.

MOST businessmen feel the continuing political debate about UK
membership of, and commitment to, the European Union is harming their
business, according to a survey of 1700 firms carred out by the CBI and
British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).
Some 58% consider the debate is unhelpful to the Government's ability
to promote British interests in the EU. Nine out of 10 favour continuing
membership of the Union and a majority want Britain to retain its
options over the single currency.
''There is hesitation and indeed a minority reject monetary union but
business opinion is clearly weighted in favour of it,'' BCC president
Robin Geldard declared. ''Only 13% believe that a single currency would
damage UK business prospects.''
CBI president Sir Bryan Nicholson added: ''What is clear from the
survey is that members of both organisations don't take kindly to the
political squabbles over Europe.''
Mr Geldard appealed for a rational and informed debate ''rather than
the current emotional wrangling,'' while Sir Bryan said that Britain
needed to play a full and constructive role in Europe, ''arguing for
competitiveness, deregulation and job creation''.
A majority of firms, 72%, support the Government's opt-out from the
Social Chapter and 70% are in favour of reducing the burden of EU
legislation, with 68% wanting to improve EU competitiveness worldwide.
Two-thirds have experienced unfair competition within the EU and 44%
complain that British officials are over-zealous in implementing EU
legislation.

SEEBOARD, the regional electricity company (REC) serving South-east
England, including parts of London, has agreed to be taken over by the
Dallas-based Central and South West Corporation (CSW) for #1600m cash,
equivalent to 635p per share. There is a loan note alternative.
News of the bid led Seeboard's shares to surge 97p to 628p.
The offer values Seeboard at 13.6-times adjusted earnings for the year
ended March 31, 1995. The offer represents a premium of 20% over the
closing price of Seeboard shares on November 3, the last trading day
prior to the bid announcement. The price includes Seeboard's interim
dividend payment.
CSW fully supports Seeboard's intention to distribute its 7.3% holding
in the National Grid company to its shareholders and to make a customer
rebate as announced on October 25.
CSW is a public utility company which owns, among other things, four
electric utility operating subsidiaries, providing electricity to
1,700,000 customers. Its geographic area of operation is the second
largest served by any electric utility system in the US. It has a market
capitalisation of around $5200m.
Tom Shockley of CSW Enterprises, the international development arm of
CSW, said he ''could not be more pleased'' to have secured Seeboard's
approval for the bid which he described as a ''full and fair offer''.
He added that the strategic combination of the two groups would
underpin Seeboard's future as a successful electricity and gas company,
allowing both companies to exchange best working practices to improve
levels of customer service and enhance operational efficiencies. In
addition, CSW hopes to gain experience which it can apply to the US
electricty industry which is itself going through a deregulation
process.
Jim Ellis, chief executive of Seeboard, said that the company had not
solicited any mergers with anyone. CSW's was the only formal bid which
it had received. Mr Ellis will be become chairman as well as chief
executive of Seeboard and is to be invited to join the CSW board upon
the offer becoming wholly unconditional.
As part of an on-going efficiency drive, Seeboard, along with the
other RECs, has slashed its workforce since privatisation. Staff numbers
have dropped from 6300 to a current level of around 4000. A further 300
job losses are expected this year, with 100 pencilled in for next year.
Other potential areas ripe for cost-cutting are actively being looked at
although Mr Ellis said that no pressure to accelerate the programme had
come from CSW.
CSW was thwarted in its earlier attempt to takeover a REC when its
joint offer with Houston Industries for Norweb failed. (Norweb was
subsequently taken over by North West Water creating Britain's first
multi-utility.) CSW knew of Norweb's track record because it had worked
with the company on US power projects. City analysts had been expecting
either or both of the US companies to re-enter the fray for the
dwindling number of RECs who remain independent.

THE Powerhouse electrical retailing joint venture between Southern
Electric, Eastern group and Midlands Electricity, has been sold to
Hanson for an undisclosed price. The business had been on the market
since May.
Its net assets at March 31, 1995, were #20.9m. Powerhouse recorded
losses in its first three years in operation. The deal increases
Hanson's exposure to the UK electricity industry following its
successful #2500m takeover of Eastern Group earlier this year.

EUROSTAR trains to Paris and Brussels through the Channel Tunnel are
taking a toll on airline traffic to the cities but apart from this
everything seems to be going well for British Airways.
Growth in the travel market has powered its profits up 23% at #430m
for the six months to September, though the second quarter improvement
was a more leisurely 12%. The interim dividend is raised by a tenth to
3.85p and it can be taken as shares instead of cash.
Traffic on the London-Paris route fell by 13% but the train has
expanded the whole market, with a 30% increase in the number of people
travelling by train or plane.
BA's load factor reached a record 76.9% in the six months, with over
80% achieved in the second quarter, which is the peak holiday season.
Traffic rose by 10%, with growth in premium traffic level-pegging with
economy, compared with a 5.5% increase in capacity. Underlying passenger
yields were maintained.
Chairman Sir Colin Marshall is confident the trend can continue, with
the International Air Transport Association forecasting annual growth of
6.5% into the next century. Traffic growth is now absorbing the excess
capacity which has plagued the industry for five years. Sir Colin sees
the threat of an all-out fares war receding and there are signs of less
discounting. But competitive pressures will continue.
BA is having fewer sleepless nights over its #251m investment in USAir
these days. It has made progress with fleet and route rationalisation
and expects to make a profit this year.
In fact, the improvement in its performance has been such that rivals
are viewing it as a possible takeover target. This would rob BA of its
US feeder into its transatlantic flights, though Sir Colin says it is
inundated with approaches from other US airlines eager to fill any gap.
Meanwhile USAir's traffic feed into BA has jumped by 50% and it will
make a larger contribution to BA's profits this year compared with #70m
last time. The group's European airlines, TAT in France and Deutsche BA,
have improved their performance though are still making losses.
Cost-cutting is proceeding, as it is in the main airline, which
expects to take #150m of costs out this year. Underlying unit costs were
slightly down in the six months. With cashflow up 40%, net debt was
reduced by #225m, taking the net debt to total capital ratio down from
64% to 59%.

<HEADLINE>KLM's recovery slowed by pensions and tax bills</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Amsterdam, Monday -- Dutch KLM's transformation from loss-making
airline into one of Europe's leanest and healthiest carriers has been
hailed a sector success story, but its latest profits indicate the
recovery may be running out of steam.
''KLM's earnings are losing momentum, although the quality is
improving,'' ING Bank analyst Thibaud de Guerre said today.
Last week the Dutch carrier reported a 15% drop in net earnings over
its traditionally high-traffic second quarter to 302m guilders ($190m)
from 354m guilders ($222m).
Profits were badly dented by a sharp increase in staff costs due to
the resumption of pension premium payments after a 21-month ''holiday''
and a hefty 95m guilder ($59m) tax bill.
The strong guilder has also cut net profit by some 150m guilders over
the first two quarters.
Despite the drop in second-quarter earnings, KLM is maintaining its
forecast of a slight gain in 1995/96 profits, as the factors which held
back profits ease off in the second half.
The airline plans to concentrate on more profitable areas of business.
In cargo it has latched on to the ''integrator'' trend, offering a more
sophisticated service direct to major companies.
In passenger business it plans selectively to expand its premium
business class by up to 10% and to reduce the number of cut-price fares
in economy.
To maintain a global network KLM wants to boost its current European
market share from around 6% to 10-15% -- which would require a strategic
European partner long term.
Asked about speculation over a link-up between KLM and British
Airways, which resurfaced recently on news BA's US partner USAir Group
was in merger talks with UAL Corp, Richard Brakenhoff at MeesPierson
said it seemed unlikely in the short term.
KLM has repeatedly stated it would prefer a European partner in a soft
currency country to offset guilder strength, but has stressed it is
currently not in negotiations with anyone. -- Reuter.

UNITED Biscuits, which yesterday announced the #316m sale of its US
cookies and crackers business, is confident it will rid itself of its
heavily loss-making Keebler salty snacks operation within the next two
months.
Shares in United Biscuits added 7p to 268p, having touched an
intra-day high of 281p, as the City registered its relief that the
highly-geared group had been able to realise a reasonable price for the
cookies and crackers part of Keebler. Volume was a hefty 8.5 million
shares.
The sale will give rise to an exceptional gain of about #40m, which
will be booked in the year to December.
However, the picture with Keebler salty snacks, which made losses of
more than $20m (#12.7m) last year and is also up for sale, is less rosy.
United Biscuits finance director John Warren said: ''I don't think
there has ever been a particularly high expectation with regard to what
we would get for salty snacks.''
Describing salty snacks as a ''substantially loss-making business in a
difficult market'', he added that an announcement regarding its disposal
would be made before the year-end.
There had been a suggestion that United Biscuits might enter into a
partnership arrangement in its efforts to get rid of Keebler salty
snacks.
However, Mr Warren, while declining to comment on the status of any
sale negotiations, yesterday ruled out the partnership possibility.
Mr Warren said United Biscuits would be ''out of America in total'',
after it sold the salty snacks business and Keebler's third division, a
much smaller but profitable frozen foods operation.
The cookies and crackers business is being bought by INFLO Holdings
Corporation, a new company which is equally owned by US food producer
Flowers Industries and Artal Luxembourg, a privately-controlled
investment vehicle.
Some of the consideration will be paid in cash, with INFLO also
assuming some debt.
United Biscuits will retain ownership of the Keebler brand outside the
Americas. It uses the Keebler name in its developing operations in China
and Indonesia.
As well as bringing about a much-needed reduction in gearing, which
stood at 93% at July 15, the disposal of the Keebler businesses will
allow United Biscuits to focus on growth of its European businesses,
which include KP, McVitie's and Ross Young.
After the Keebler disposals, more management time will also be devoted
to newer opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.
Bill McCall, an Edinburgh-based director of stockbroker Tilney, said:
''United Biscuits is now looking leaner and fitter than it has for some
time.''
United Biscuits chairman Colin Short, who has shown a determination to
tackle the group's problems head-on since he joined full-time from ICI
on July 1, described the sale of the US cookies and crackers operation
as a very satisfactory outcome.
Pre-tax losses of #48.5m were incurred by United Biscuits in the 28
weeks to July 15, compared with profits of #76.2m for the first 28 weeks
of its previous financial year.
However, the heavy losses were the result of #79.1m of exceptional
charges relating principally to United Biscuits' expensive disposal of
its loss-making Spanish snacks operation to Galletas Siro of Spain, as
well as to past and anticipated losses of Keebler salty snacks, and
reorganisation in Australia.
In its last full financial year, United Biscuits made pre-tax profits
of #134m.

HEFTY destocking by manufacturing industry across a broad front has
hit factory output, which fell by 0.6% in September. In addition the
increase in output for August was revised down from 0.6% to 0.3%.
As a result manufacturing output rose by just 0.2% in the third
quarter and was 1.2% higher than in the same three months a year ago. In
September year-on-year growth was 0.6%.
The gloomy figures boosted hopes of a cut in interest rates after the
Budget. A bout of destocking is a normal feature of the economic cycle
once the pace of activity slows down, but independent economists were
taken aback by its severity.
City analysts had expected factory output to edge ahead in September.
James Capel's Adam Cole said: ''The weakness of production in recent
months suggests that the inventory adjustment currently underway is more
severe than we had assumed.''
He did not think that the latest output figures were likely to change
the Central Statistical Office's initial estimate of third quarter gross
domestic product from 0.5%, but he warned: ''The danger of a more
pronounced slowdown has clearly increased.
''In the absence of a very loose Budget, a base rate cut in the early
months of next year now looks very secure.''
A similar conclusion was reached by Martin Brookes at Goldman Sachs.
''Providing tax cuts in the Budget are kept broadly in line with cuts in
public spending plans, the current easing in activity and inflationary
pressures should permit the Chancellor to cut base rates modestly after
the Budget,'' he said.
The fall in factory output marred the industrial production figures,
which showed a gain of 0.5% in September after a revised fall of 0.2% in
August. In the latest three-months' industrial production was 0.5%
higher. Against the same three months a year ago the increase was 1.2%.
Industrial production benefited from the sharp recovery in oil and gas
output after summer maintenance programmes came to an end. North Sea
output rose by a seasonally adjusted 6.6% between August and September
and is marginally above the previous peak recorded in March.
Between the second and third quarters oil and gas extraction advanced
by 2.9% and was 2.7% ahead of the same period of last year.
The electricity, gas, and water industries also helped to counteract
the downturn in manufacturing. Output of these industries rose by 3.5%
in September as average temperatures returned to near normal levels
after the August heatwave.
Though output of electricity, gas, and water increased by 0.9% between
the second and third quarters, it remained 1.2% lower than in the third
quarter of last year.
The manufacturing figures were weak across the board. Only fuel
refining produced an increase between August and September. The biggest
falls were in engineering, and food, drink, and tobacco (1.3% in each
case).
The quarterly figures, which most pundits would regard as a better
guide than the data for just one month, were slightly more encouraging
with most sectors managing small increases.
The main exception was textiles and clothing where output fell by 2.2%
between the second and third quarters. The weakness of manufacturing
output in general and clothing in particular points to continuing
efforts to reduce stock levels by both manufacturers and retailers.
One relief from the prevailing gloom in manufacturing came in the new
car sales figures for October, which showed an 11.5% increase to 136,605
from October of last year. Stronger fleet sales were mainly responsible.

<HEADLINE>Japanese merger will pool $620bn</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>26</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975503531</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Tokyo, Monday -- A merger between Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Bank would
create the world's biggest bank, but may require job losses during
restructuring.
If a merger, which Daiwa said today is possible, goes ahead, it would
create a banking giant with deposits of an estimated $620bn.
That compares with some $530bn for a merger of Bank of Tokyo and
Mitsubishi Bank, which is due to be born through merger next April.
In terms of assets, the banks would be roughly equal in size, with
about $705bn for the Daiwa merger and $720bn for Tokyo Mitsubishi.
Several industry analysts said that the size and breadth of the merged
Daiwa's operations could help it deal with fiercer competition following
liberalisation of Japan's banking industry.
''We could consider a merger between Daiwa and Sumitomo a positive
incentive for both banks,'' said Nozomu Kunishige, at Kleinwort Benson
International.
But the merged giant could be unwieldy if the two banks do not cut
staff and overlapping operations because of management problems or
policies, analysts said.
However the new bank would have two main advantages over domestic
rivals. It would inherit Daiwa's trust banking operation, which has
given it a strong pension fund business. Daiwa is the only one among
Japan's 11 main banks to have a trust banking operation.
Sumitomo's close ties with many blue-chip Japanese firms could help
develop pension business, analysts said.
Also, the new bank would have Cosmo Securities Co, a brokerage which
became a Daiwa subsidiary in 1993. Japanese banks were recently allowed
to enter the securities business by setting up subsidiaries, but unlike
Cosmo, they are not at present permitted to sell or underwrite stocks.
But James Phillip Fiorillo, at Baring Securities (Japan), said those
two strong points may not remain advantages for long, as Japan
liberalises its financial industry further.
Moreover the business cultures of Daiwa and Sumitomo, both based in
Osaka, are very different, Fiorillo said, with Sumitomo having an
aggressive approach while Daiwa is more conservative, opening the way
for policy clashes.
Sumitomo is expected to play the leading role in any alliance, as a
merger would in essence be a rescue for Daiwa, which is reeling from
punitive actions against it by US and Japanese authorities for its
failure to promptly report trading losses, analysts said.
Some said Sumitomo would therefore not hesitate to cut excess staff at
Daiwa, as it might have done in an equal merger between the two banks.
Sumitomo had over 17,000 employees while Daiwa had over 9600 as of March
this year. -- Reuter.

IN 1994 only 10% of British adults gambled regularly. In 1995 that
figure has risen to 66%. Welcome to the brave new world of the National
Lottery, which celebrates its first birthday this month.
Each week 30 million people spend #60m on lottery tickets. Another
#30m is rubbed out in scratchcards. The National Lottery, to date, has
created 115 instant millionaires, earned tens of millions for the
Treasury, dented givings to charity, led to several suicides, made
Winston Churchill's grandson a fortune, and kept the cheap press
enjoyably engaged in the exploit of folly, envy, backbiting, and malice.
Money ain't everything. Take the fate of Mukhtar Mohidin, a
40-year-old Blackburn factory worker, who last December won the first
''roll-over'' jackpot -- a mindblowing #17.9m. He sought desperately to
remain anonymous. The request was in vain; winners are always known by
enough nasty people to tip off the tabloids. Mohidin has long since fled
Blackburn, and resumed life in the Home Counties under a new identity.
Now and again we are entertained by reports of marriage strains and
bitter fights over whose in-laws are to receive what.
At least Mohidin isn't Mark Gardener, a Hastings double-glazer, who in
June enjoyed a 50% cut of the mighty #22m jackpot. The ink was barely
dry on Gardener's ticket when folk crawled from under stones to screech
invective. His adoptive mother declared, ''I hope he drinks himself to
death''. His real mother managed to top this. ''I have a vision of Mark
finishing up with a Ferrari going into a brick wall -- and I hope it's
tomorrow.''
Gardener's second estranged wife demanded a massive cut, for their
divorce had not become absolute. She settled for #1m. And a
self-described ''one-time best friend'', who claimed once to have saved
Gardener's life, said it was ''the worst thing I ever did''.
Camelot's press officer, Alison Howard, insists that ''despite
negative publicity'' Mr Gardener still says that winning the lottery is
the best thing that's ever happened to him.
Camelot, of course -- now earning vast profits for its directors -- is
keen to minimise damaging tales. To this end, it has a highly honed
machine ready to counsel, and protect, the winners of megabucks. An
ex-policeman and two psychologists run, as a flying squad, to prepare
jackpot winners for the new world of riches. Winners are advised to tell
no-one outwith their immediate family circle. If they want to go public
(and Camelot certainly enjoys the display of ecstatic winning families)
then a press conference is arranged.
If not -- and if some tabloid hack sniffs them out -- Camelot has safe
houses, secret nests where winners can be hidden until some new
sensational scooper is ordained to divert the press.
The stupidity of many winners is unfathomable. They screech the news
to the skies and are then bewildered by the mixed reactions about them.
Rapacious relatives come begging for money. Hysterical in-laws take to
the bottle -- or phone the Sun. Letters arrive by the hundred, asking
for a sub ''to get us out of trouble''; the average sum, apparently,
being #8000.
Winners give up their jobs, move house to posh areas, install their
children at expensive private schools. One couple, who won #2.4m in
April, promptly gave #500,000 to each of their married daughters. (They
and their husbands, one as young as 29, have retired from all
employment.)
Another man, having bought for himself a new house, car, and caravan,
not to mention a massive stereo system, a multi-gym and two Penny Blacks
for his stamp album, got his little girl three priceless porcelain
dolls, his little boy an 80cc motorbike, five train sets, a complete set
of Disney videos, a tank of tropical fish, some finches, and two
chipmunks.
But they had to leave their council house after weeks of abuse and
vandalism. The children were whipped from their school after a teacher,
driven beyond endurance by the boy's incessant bragging about winning
the lottery, rebuked him mightily. The little girl now misses her old
friends. In the photo accompanying David Cohen's excellent article in
the Independent, the family look unutterably miserable.
At least they're not Lee Ryan, 32, who won #6.5m in March. This big
spender has, to date, spent #500,000 on a motorcade of cars (including a
Jaguar, Bentley, Porsche, BMW, and the inevitable Ferrari), #250,000 on
a helicopter, and #700,000 on a country estate. Ryan won't enjoy these
goodies this Christmas; he'll be serving an 18-month prison sentence for
handling stolen cars (an offence he committed before scooping the
jackpot).
Is there anything in this saga of people acquiring grotesque sums of
money to suggest that the National Lottery does society any good?
It has become what we always warned: an additional tax on the poor.
Charities are howling with pain, street collectors coming back with a
legion of tales of being rebuffed ''because I buy lottery tickets and
you get money that way, don't you?'' (In fact only a tiny percentile of
lottery funds reach British charities: Camelot gets a bigger cut, and
the Treasury the biggest of all.)
Nor -- contrary to what we were told last year -- are these funds
treated as bounty over public monies. Already one government department
has turned down a request for subsidy because the cause had already won
a tranche of lottery money, and this -- so conceded the official letter
-- was looked on as part of public spending.
The ''Instants'' scratchcards are a frightening development. In
America, scratchcard addiction is a growing and serious phenomenon,
requiring psychiatric treatment. We read in the summer of one Englishman
who kept buying #50 of scratchcards a week, so revolting staff at a
local newsagent that at length they refused to serve him. Worst of all,
our post offices now stock -- and flaunt -- National Lottery facilities,
in the very place where the most vulnerable members of society go to
collect pensions, cash Giros, and receive various public benefits.
There is, too, a blasphemous aspect to the National Lottery which is
highly offensive to Christians. God is parodied in the TV adverts,
booming ''It's you . . .'' Christians believe in providence, not chance
or ''Lady Luck''. The drawing of lots is a biblical way, under
providence, to decide questions otherwise insoluble -- like apportioning
land or dividing a fishing haul. As a device for fools winning --
stealing -- the money of other fools, it is indefensible.
The saddest thing is that there is no prospect of this dreadful
institution being abolished. Opposition politicians deride Camelot, or
talk of capping jackpot sums. No Labour, Liberal or Nationalist
spokesman dares to advocate its destruction. Why? The National Lottery
is for the mob; the mob, in Major's Britain, is too strong.

ONLY when the detail spills out in the weeks and months following
Kenneth Clarke's Budget on November 28 will we be able to judge, with
any objective confidence, the real quality of the spending deal Michael
Forsyth has accepted for Scotland for the coming year.
Eight days ago the Daily Telegraph was reporting that the tradition of
higher per capita spending for Scotland and Wales was under attack to
fund tax cuts and was urging ministers, in an editorial, to ''end the
pork barrel preference enjoyed by Scotland and Wales''.
By Saturday morning, the Financial Times was telling us that the
Scottish Secretary had been ''singled out'' for tough treatment in this
year's spending round. That was followed by further speculation on
Sunday that the Treasury was determined to slice more than #600m from
the Scottish Office budget next year, with road building, industrial
support, and administration costs the main victims.
Threaded through all the stories was the prospect of the so-called
Barnett formula, which has governed changes in Scotland's spending
allocation since 1978, being changed or even scrapped, something Mr
Forsyth had said would only happen ''over my dead body''.
The Scottish Secretary flew south to Chequers at the weekend,
ostensibly to fight his corner. We do not know whether he carried a
ceremonial dirk in his red box or had a cyanide capsule clenched
menacingly between his teeth. But he is still with us. And a deal was
done.
According to some reports, the Prime Minister intervened personally to
preserve the Barnett formula. But there is considerable confusion about
precisely what Mr Forsyth has managed to salvage. ''Forsyth defeats
spending cuts'' announced one of our rivals on page four yesterday. But
by page six the same paper was warning us that Scotland's road
improvement schemes are still under threat from cuts.
Confused? You should be. The Barnett formula is fast becoming the
political equivalent of Kelvin's second law of thermodynamics. Lots of
people have heard of it. Very few seem to understand what it means or
how it operates.
Barnett, despite numerous reports to the contrary, does not determine
the size of Scotland's slice of the government spending cake each year.
Nor does it, of itself, buttress existing higher levels of government
spending per head in Scotland than in England.
Rather it determines what share Scotland automatically gets of changes
in equivalent UK spending programmes year-on-year. Since 1992, when the
formula was last altered, Scotland gets 10.66% of any changes in
comparable English programmes or 10.06% of changes in programmes which
cover both England and Wales. Before that the Barnett percentages were
11.76% and 11.11% respectively. They were reduced, in Michael Portillo's
period as chief secretary at the Treasury, to reflect Scotland's falling
population.
The trouble with the Barnett formula, from the Government's
perspective, isn't just that it enshrines the alleged pork-barrel
settlement with Scotland. The trouble is that it enshrines an assumption
that government spending is going to grow in real terms every year.
When the budget is growing, restricting Scotland's share of every
additional #100 spent in England to #10.66 rather than the pre-1992
#11.76 is the kind of news back-bench Tory MPs who think Scotland is
feather-bedded want to hear.
But when total government spending is falling in real terms -- as it
is this year and is now certain to do next -- making Scotland's share of
every #100 slashed from the English budget #10.66 rather than #11.76
has, perversely, the opposite effect. It cushions the impact of the cuts
north of the Border. If we could be sure that government spending will
continue to fall in years to come, it would be in Scotland's interest to
see the Barnett percentages reduced even more.
So, when Michael Forsyth tells us he is prepared to lay down his life
to protect the existing formula, he can, at a time of shrinking real
spending, both have his cake and eat it. He can appear to fight
Scotland's corner. And at the same time he can acquiesce in Scotland
sustaining a bigger share of the cuts than might otherwise have been the
case.
One other aspect of the speculation should, perhaps, concern us more.
Under the existing system the Scottish Secretary accepts a fixed
percentage of changes in equivalent English spending programmes. But, in
return, he is allowed to allocate those resources -- the so-called
Scottish block which, this year, accounts for 96.3% of the #14.4bn
expenditure within Mr Forsyth's responsibility -- as he sees fit.
The Government has consistently argued that that kind of discretion is
the kind of practical devolution Scotland really needs. In Scotland in
the Union: A Partnership for Good it said: ''The Government believes
this discretion is vital to ensuring that public spending yields the
maximum benefit in Scotland.''
But, consistently, the speculation of recent days has suggested that,
in return for retaining Barnett, Mr Forsyth has had to agree to deeper
cuts in some areas of his Scottish budget, like road building and
industrial support, than might otherwise have been the case.
IS Barnett being bypassed altogether, where the Treasury decrees that
Scottish programmes must be cut at least as savagely as those south of
the Border? Or has Mr Forsyth been forced to pre-pledge his own package
of cuts as the price of retaining a Barnett-style outcome. Only after
the 28th will we begin to get at the facts.
But if we are indeed seeing some erosion of the Scottish Secretary's
freedom to allocate his block in line with Scottish priorities, we are
also witnessing significant retreat from the practical devolution the
Major Government considers so superior to the constitutional tinkering
favoured by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Taking stock in reverse.

FIVE years ago this week the rag trade, seized by unaccustomed guilt,
turned the better of its two faces towards humanity and staged Fashion
Aid at the Royal Albert Hall. This was vanity's response to Bob Geldof's
rowdy harangue for the rich to feed the impoverished. Much has changed
since then, and much remains the same. But on that night, towards the
end of the first 12 months of the 1990s, we still had hope that this
would be the caring decade and, like Band Aid, Fashion Aid seemed an
honourable means to demonstrate a new world order of compassion.
Well, here in 1995 we now know that this notion was composed of
self-delusion. The only look of starvation which commands attention
today belongs to models on the catwalk, their polished but
undernourished torsos fed only by a gluttony for fame and bank vaults of
money: Linda Evangelista set the fiscal standard three years ago when
she proclaimed there was no point her getting out of bed to work unless
the fee was at least $10,000 a day.
Of course, certain footballers and gold-digging industrialists believe
the same, having turned Gordon Gekko's Wall Street line, ''greed is
good'' into a moral crusade. But on that fine November night in London,
the dressing-up business acquitted itself well by adding more than #1m
to Geldof's coffers for the developing world.
In many ways it was a certifiable scene. Geldof himself, gaunt from
'flu as well as angst, steadfastly clutched the rim of the grand circle
with his left hand, as if seeking some fixed object among the whooping
swirl. On his other hand he bit the fingernails non-stop. Everything
about the event was a contradiction. Against a Faustian backdrop of
flame-red theatre boxes the international sophisticate and the
screeching, street-cred groupie sat together, doling out small fortunes
for landscapes more alien to them than the moon.
Naively at first, but then doggedly, Jasper Conran, the designer, had
set himself the task of bringing together on a single runway the most
noteworthy creations of 18 warring egos; designs of the moment from
quarrelsome fashion stars who normally demand top-of-the-bill exposure
or none at all.
BUT in charity's cause Conran pulled off his impresario role, as model
celebrities and designer royalty, blue-blood aristos, rockers and ravers
swarmed, free of fees, under the spotlights. Fashion believers still
argue about who actually outshone whom: Jerry Hall in a hoopla gown of
crimson and gold; Shirley Bassey like a fin de siecle lampshade in
yellow Zandra Rhodes beadery; The Who's Pete Townsend re-born as
Establishment Man; The Eurythmics in Hamnett's Save The World saffron
robes; Grace Jones as Miyake's warrior queen; the brother of the
Princess of Wales, escorting a scarlet woman on each arm; Boy George
camping it, vamping it, tramping it, in Body Map's black leggings and
undertaker's coat. Or, in that now poignant finale of pretence, Freddie
Mercury got up like a toy soldier, as the model bridegroom to the
Emanuels' frothy bride.
And who could forget the crowd: women nutty about clothes, men nutty
about each other arriving in cliques and claques, in plumes and ruffles,
Regency turbans, cartwheel brims and bustles, sequins and CND jewellery
in gold? Some fashion eccentrics never cave in, they just hold
themselves together with more jewellery than ever. We remember an old
magnifico in the balcony. Hands heavy with semi-precious stones, cheeks
rouged to a poppy bloom, he perched in an alcove as if he were some
ancient, exotic vessel, cracked and veined but still in one piece.
In all it was a party high on self-regard, yet for a while it did act
generously on behalf of others. And it was also the kind of sparky
send-up which London used to pull off with more outrageous success than
any other style capital. Fashion Aid couldn't have happened in New York
with such tremendous brio because the garment district there is caught
in a straitjacket of middle America conformity. It couldn't have
happened either in Paris or Milan, where style still stands aloof from
any braggart rock connections.
But even here its time won't come again, at least not in the grudging
nineties. Those models who earn the biggest bucks for the scantiest
appearance now do absolutely nothing for nothing. The industry has
raised them as monsters and has, itself, reverted to being predatory.
And Fashion Aid's brilliant symbol of giving, that wire coathanger
shaped into the stark outline of Africa? It lies now like a forgotten
curio, tipped into the basement of the rag-trade's careless trash.

DISCONCERTING news for those who favour the quiet life comes from the
Mull of Kintyre where Beatle Paul McCartney MBE has a hideaway and
writer Naomi Mitchison, now just two years short of her first century,
dreams even yet of the collapse of the capitalist system under the
weight of its own greed.
Keith Schellenberg -- the name that launched a thousand schemes -- has
gained a foothold on the thin finger of tranquillity following the
recent sale of his Inner-Hebridean idyll, the Island of Eigg, to a
German.
The occasionally lachrymose Mr Schellenberg, hot-air balloonist and
high-speed performer on the cresta run, has moved lock, stock, and power
boat to Kilean Castle and its 3000 acre estate, a run-down fiefdom for
which, he says, he has ''plans''.
Islanders on Eigg, asked nicely or not at all, will tell the anxious
of Kintyre that Mr Schellenberg had ''plans'' for their little part of
paradise, what became of them and just how their erstwhile laird's
ambitions affected all concerned.
Alternatively they may refer to the title of one of Lady Mitchison's
early works, We Have Been Warned, and leave it at that. Mr Schellenberg,
out of Eigg but by no means down, still has plenty of steam in his
boiler to give his version of events.
Without pressing he will recall the torching of his vintage
Rolls-Royce car and private fire-engine, speak of devotion and
sacrifice, and make much of alleged peasant ingratitude. He has told the
Diary on a number of occasions that he is a much misunderstood man.
Watch this space.
One byte at cherry
FOR students of the small print so frequently found at the bottom of
too-good-to-be-true offers comes a finely computed gem of the genre from
the capital.
A sharp IT war has broken out on the West Side of the city for the
wallets of the ambitious who want to turn their spare bedroom into a
replica of the Star Wars control centre which finally turned President
Reagan's mind.
Even as a new micro-chip supermarket -- ''Byte, the Computer
Super-Store'' -- staged its grand opening, complete with helicopter,
nearby rival PC World advertised a spoiler. In VERY BOLD type it offered
no less than #950 off the price of a top-brand PC, yours for just #299.
But in very small type the advert revealed that the offer applied only
to the first one sold. Hurry while stocks last.
Title fight
NOW a date for your diary. Be there or be square on the fourth and
fifth of January when no less a luminary in the world of Paws Dexter and
Sinister, our very own Lord Lyon King of Arms, Sir Malcolm Innes of
Edingight, sits in due pomp and circumstance to sort out a cousinly
spat.
Just who, he must determine, is the real Earl of Selkirk . . . banker
Alasdair Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton, known to his intimates as the Master
of Selkirk, or the 16-year-old eldest lad of Scottish Office Minister
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton?
What is at stake, it goes without saying, is the academic resolution
of who inherits the title, pure and simple; and the unworthy among you
who may think that the two-day sitting of the Lyon Court is really about
the half million worth of the folding stuff that will go to the winner
should put such tawdry suspicion to the back of their mind. All Govan,
possibly even Possil, we know will be on the edge of their seats for the
outcome.
No holds Bard
IT is brace-yourself time in the publishing word. The Duke of
Rothesay, Earl of Carrick and Baron Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and
Prince and Great Steward of Scotland -- better known as Charles,
estranged husband of Di -- has another seminal work, The Prince's
Choice, ready to hit -- or miss -- the best-seller lists. It is all
about his best-loved passages from the works of William Shakespeare.
Charles has been graciously pleased to admit he did not much care for
Shakespeare when at Gordonstoun but has since developed a taste . . .
his favourite work being Henry V because of its insights into the minds
of commoners and kings.
Will The Prince's Choice, #12.99 in paperback, be the run-away success
that Budgie the Helicopter proved for his sister-in-law? Word from
Strathclyde Police is that there is no contingency plan in hand for
crowd control even though the royal choice is now on sale . . . not even
in Glasgow's West End. What can this mean?
Bargain books
STILL in the book business and great bargains to be had thanks to the
cost-conscious councillors who oversee the libraries run by the district
council in Edinburgh. From time to time the library service there offers
for sale books that are surplus to requirements.
It is not just worn-out Agatha Christie manor house murders beloved by
the elderly confused or Jeffrey Archer pap bought in for the delectation
of that growing band of Shakespeare's people who have difficulty with
joined up thought that find their way into the sales.
Weighty reference works -- in both senses of the word -- jostle for
space with the transient, and all at just 40p a book. Obligingly the
library service marks the original price of the books in the fly-sheet
-- the kind of thing those paying the country's highest council tax like
to know about.
Thus a friend of the Diary is able to tell us that for the modest
outlay of just #4 he acquired this past weekend books that cost #926
when they were first put on the library shelves no more than two years
ago.
Declaring interests
THE early death of ''Harry'' Northumberland at the age of 42 -- he was
not a frequent visitor to Glasow -- triggered a scad of heavyweight
obituaries which revealed that, among other things, the 11th Duke of
Northumberland, godson of the Queen and head of the House of Percy, was
a collector of good works, the apogee his presidency of the Alnwick
Working Men's Club and Institute . . . a post for which his possession
of 100,000 acres and some #200m might appear to some to have made him
singularly unsuited.
In pursuit of the bizarre the Diary has examined the extra-curricular
interests of a few of Scotia's great and good . . . for example, the
Earl of Elgin who, in addition to an interest in marbles that has
survived boyhood, can boast an unrivalled collection of 'Freemans'' with
Bridgeton, Barbados; Regina, Port Elgin; Winnipeg; St Thomas, Ontario;
and Moose Jaw already under his belt.
Agnew of Lochnaw, in addition to a taste in dress that runs to the
baroque, collects military expeditions to places so remote that the
penguins have probably never seen a Rothesay Herald in full fig. East
Greenland has seen Sir Crispin twice, Elephant Island in Antartica just
one, Chilean Patagonia has been done and dusted, Everest tackled,
North-west Nepal conquered . . . and so on and so forth.
The 12th Duke of Argyll, whose late step-mother Margaret is still
fondly remembered by so many, has a collection of titles without equal
but none the less finds time to be Admiral of the Western Coast and
Isles, Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland and the castles of
Dunstaffnage, Dunoon and Carrick, and Tarbert. Why are the rest of us so
idle?

Survey confirms that -- just like at school -- development without
diversion is a winner for women, writes Wendy Jack.
SINGLE-SEX education regularly demonstrates very high academic
achievement for girls, and now a leading women's training consultancy
has published a survey of 1452 women who overwhelmingly believe that
single-sex development courses are more beneficial to them than
mixed-sex equivalents.
The 32-page survey, Women Singled Out, claims to be the only
quantitative examination of the value of women-only development
training.
It is unusual in that it includes the views of both non-management and
unemployed women; and it reveals that 95.7% of women who have attended
women-only development courses believe the all-female aspect was of
benefit to them, while 72.9% said it enhanced their learning.
A large majority of the women (87.5%) stated that they would recommend
a female-only course to other women.
The survey was set up by the Springboard Consultancy, which is headed
by the charismatic Liz Willis (founder of the Industrial Society's
Pepperell Unit back in 1984) and Scot Jenny Daisley. They work
extensively on women's development programmes in the UK as well as
having trainers in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Guiana, France,
and Demark.
The consultancy holds a National Training Award for excellence and
quality in training.
The 1452 women who took part in the survey were drawn from 140 British
organisations, spanning different jobs, ages and races, and had all
attended a broad variety of female-only development training events.
In comparing these courses with those for mixed sexes, the women
reported that they felt:
* More confident
* More able to express views
* More able to be trusting
* More free to be themselves
* More able to take risks
But in 15 years or so of running programmes for women, Willis must
surely feel some dismay, as she reports: ''Confidence-building and
assertiveness training are still the courses that most women in all
sorts of jobs and organisations seek, when we do research for
programmes. It's quite depressing really.''
But why does she think women continue to be dogged by a lack of
confidence all these years down the line?
''My interpretation is that, although there are lots more women at
work and many wonderful stories about pioneering women, the fact remains
that virtually any woman in the world of paid employment, is still a
minority in a majority culture.
''That majority culture is still determined by white, able-bodied men.
Although there may be an awful lot of women at certain levels --
clerical for example -- the culture they're operating in is still not
their culture.
''It's like a stranger in a foreign land, so of course they still lack
confidence because the rules, the way things are done, the vocabulary,
codes of dress and behaviour, are not theirs.''
This majority culture is not particularly successful, says Liz Willis,
and she believes many men don't enjoy it either -- ''which is why I feel
women's development has an awful lot to offer society at large; women
have the opportunity to change the world of work in a way that men
can't, because they are somehow trapped by it''.

They need a wider range of specialist skills, says BILL MAGEE.
INVESTMENT management is fast rising in its importance as a key job in
the City. But what is not widely appreciated is the increasingly
specialised nature of this financial discipline.
Scotland has pride of place in the European marketplace and has, along
with the rest of the UK, experienced more dramatic technical changes in
the past 20 years than at any other time.
New technology, deregulation and an increased internationalism each
lie at the heart of these advances and, to develop his or her career, an
investment manager has had to embrace all three.
A budding manager has to therefore take on board the likelihood that,
once having entered the industry, there will be a requirement to look
into many other areas of the specialism. The days of the old-style more
generalist financial adviser have gone forever.
Whether it be private-client work or other related fields,
inter-personal skills are crucial to success, according to Jeremy
Richardson, director of Noble Securities, the Edinburgh-based portfolio
management company.
''I started in private client stockbroking eight years ago,'' he says,
''and that gave me an excellent background to the different
opportunities offered by companies, private clients and the wide range
of institutions who participate in the marketplace. You must be able to
converse with people, to obtain the confidence and trust of a client,
and to ultimately make their assets perform, in line with investment
objectives and agreed risk.''
But crucial to the success of an investment manager these days is
keeping up with the pace of change.
Cross-border takeovers are on the increase, together with foreign
direct investment, and the development of international groupings.
Stocks are now truly international.
With all of this taken into account, Jeremy Richardson of Nobles says:
''Increasingly it is a requirement for the specialist manager to know
the country or countries involved and to speak the language(s) plus have
some knowledge of the local economy and politics.''
Many managers have found the crossover to more specialised fields
occurring in their late 20s and early 30s. ''This can mean that a
trainee lawyer gets the opportunity to become involved in managing money
and take decisions over where to invest funds.''
David Holland is a case in point. Assistant Secretary with Edinburgh
Fund Managers, he studied business law while going for his BA in
accountancy at Stirling University, subsequently becoming a chartered
accountant.
This came in handy when he became involved with the launch of the
Malvern UK Interest Trust. He had to monitor various economic pointers
and make a manager's report to his board. ''I had to keep abreast of the
corporate action side of the UK market as it affected the trust.''
Successful investment managers can also come from accountancy and the
move into this industry can present opportunities for individuals who
have trained in other seemingly quite divorced areas.
What is apparent is that the field of investment management offers an
impressive and ever-growing list of specialist niche work.

The site supervisor.
Eric Kennedy meets a man who was inspired by the sites he saw.
HARRY GAUGHAN looks at fields rather differently from most of us. He
tends to see potential housing estates, with fine, detached homes,
well-kept gardens, and thriving communities.
To be fair, he doesn't actually want to turn all fields into housing
estates. It's just that, as an award-winning site supervisor, he gets a
bit excited when the opportunity arises.
At present he is in the early stages of turning one greenfield site,
at Alloway in Ayrshire, into an estate of 39 detached homes. It is an
#8m development. Quite a responsibility for a chap who left school in
1979 with seven O-Levels and a wish to become a dentist.
Harry Gaughan thrives, however, on responsibility. That is one of the
secrets of success at this job, where an ability to co-ordinate the
activities of a wide variety of trades is a must.
Harry is a joiner to trade, having abandoned his dentistry ideas at
the age of 16 when he saw the money being made by some of his pals. He
took an all-trades craft exam in which he ended up in the top five per
cent of 1500 West of Scotland candidates and this led to an influx of
offers.
He accepted one, as an apprentice joiner in Paisley, served his time
for three years, and was kept on after that. Meanwhile, he had been
attending Reid Kerr College in the town, and he achieved Advanced City
and Guilds Certificates with Distinction for Carpentry and Joinery, and
for Communications Skills.
After a further two years with the Paisley firm he began freelancing,
working on a variety of contracts. It was, he says, ''part of the
learning curve'' and it gave him a chance to observe site supervisors in
action.
He thought: I could do that. And after a period working with Renfrew
District Council, he took a #4500 pay cut to accept a job as an
assistant site supervisor with a major quality builder.
He worked at sites in East Kilbride, Stirling, Newton Mearns and
Wemyss Bay.
Then he became a fully-fledged supervisor at a site in Cumbernauld,
building 49 detached houses and meeting with conspicuous success.
At his first attempt he won the NHBC Pride In The Job award for Site
Supervisor of the Year in Scotland, in the face of competition from 1800
others. Then he finished in the top nine out of 22,000 when he
represented Scotland in the national event. His pay-cut gamble had paid
off and his earnings now are far ahead of what he once had as a joiner.
His site won a Seal of Excellence in September of this year, but
meanwhile Harry has been asked to take over at Alloway. He loves the job
and gets there at 7.30am ''to welcome the guys on site''.
After that, he is constantly busy checking supplies of everything from
sand to glue, cement to timber, liaising with people from the water,
electricity and gas boards, meeting with building-control officials, and
resolving problems.
''There's never the luxury of lunch hour,'' he says, ''but I love
every minute of it. I like dealing with people and enjoy seeing a job
well done.''
And although there are building management courses at universities and
colleges throughout the country, he considers a trades background to be
at least equal in importance to success. ''Especially in joinery,'' he
adds with a smile.

How a desire for parental participation got some brave adults back
into the classroom to acquire vital computing skills.
IT is quite common these days for adults to return to school --
secondary school, that is. Now the story has taken an unusual twist with
eight parents of St Mary's Primary School in the Maryhill area of
Glasgow successfully completing the Scotvec module ''Introduction to
Computer Application Packages''.
Before an assembled gathering of the staff and all 270 pupils of St
Mary's, the eight parents were presented with their certificates and
bouquets of flowers by the head teacher, Alice Quinn, and local regional
councillor Neelam Bakshi.
In the process of their own study the parents have developed the
ability to help pupils acquire computer skills in class and Councillor
Bakshi was gratified that ''the children have the chance to see their
parents in a different role, in a learning environment; this in turn can
have a beneficial effect on home relationships''.
According to Alice Quinn, the initiative arose from collaborative work
that St Mary's was undertaking with parents on child development. The
desire to acquire basic computing skills was frequently expressed and
Mrs Quinn's depute, Heidi Fawcett, set up and taught parental workshops.
''They were keen to learn about computers but they were terrified,''
she said. ''The workshops were designed to put them at their ease. We
have eleven computers, including four Apple Macs, so the parents were
able to work with classes on a timetabled basis.''
Mrs Fawcett approached Frank Murphy, a community education officer
based in Maryhill, to take the parents' enthusiasm forward. ''They were
interested in their own right,'' he said, ''but also because they heard
their kids talking about computing. My idea was to bring in Anniesland
College to set up an outreach class and that was arranged through Tommy
Burns, their community liaison coordinator.''
Said Mr Burns: ''We are all about taking the college to the students.
We asked Stephen McInally, a part-time lecturer in computing, to tutor
the group. He took them through the basics of word processing, graphics
and databases to achieve their module.''
Stephen McInally found the group ''very keen'', once they got past
their initial apprehension. ''It went extremely well -- none of them
really struggled. Now they want to go on to more advanced work in areas
like desktop publishing.''
The spin-off is already becoming evident. As well as continuing with
their studies, the eight parents -- all of whom already make their
services available in other areas of the operation of the school, such
as the tuckshop -- will go on cooperating with teachers in training the
pupils to use computers.
On top of that, a new group of parents is starting to prepare for the
same Scotvec module. A positive trend has been established.
Head teacher Alice Quinn -- who reminded the pupil assembly that
''education is not just for the young, it is a lifelong activity'' --
saw the initiative as ''raising the morale and self-esteem of the
parents''.
The initial group of eight were all women -- though one of the
original members was a man who left after obtaining employment through
his work with the school.
The women, some of whom had not taken their own education forward at
all since leaving school, regarded the blossoming of their confidence as
a major outcome of the tuition, which took place for two hours a week in
the evening.
One of the parents completing the Scotvec module was Jackie McCartney,
who, because of her earlier contribution to the life of the school, had
been recruited as a special needs auxiliary. ''We saw her skills in
various areas of the school,'' said Alice Quinn, ''and had the chance to
observe her working with children.''
Jackie McCartney confessed that ''I didn't have a clue about computers
but the tutor was fantastic; he made us feel relaxed and took the time
to sit down and explain things to each of us''.
Angela Hodgkins was grateful that the course had worked wonders with
her confidence. Holding the classes in St Mary's had been a great
benefit because ''travelling to college in the evening would have taken
a lot of extra time and we prefer our kids to be in bed at set times''.
She is keen to proceed to desktop publishing because ''we could put out
a PTA newsletter and become a printing resource for the community''.
Patricia Wilson, who coaches the St Mary's pupils in netball, said:
''My son is really interested in computers so I wanted to learn a lot
more about them. I was five weeks late in starting the module but, with
the tutor's help, I soon caught up.
''Now I want to go on because, like some of the other parents, I hope
my computing abilities can help me to find a good job.''

NB from an unwilling scribe: JOHN McLENNAN laments the failure of an
education system that has left a 20-year-old literally unable to sign
on.
ONE thing's for sure: he won't be reading this. He can't. He's still
illiterate.
It's four and a half years since I acted as his scribe, which involved
reading out questions to him and writing down his answers when he was
taking his Standard Grade exams in a secondary school.
It was a bizarre experience, but I had more or less forgotten about
David (not his real name) until a few weeks ago when his mother phoned
me out of the blue to ask if I could do anything for her son who,
despite having attended various adult literacy classes since leaving
school, was still unable to read or write.
My response was of necessity evasive since what David really needs is
one-to-one teaching with an experienced primary teacher able to diagnose
and correct the mistakes others made during his primary and secondary
schooling.
When it came down to it, what did I really know about David? What for
that matter can anyone who is literate know about someone who isn't? The
ability to read and write is so much a part of normality for most of us
that to conceive what it's like not to be able to do these things
requires a leap of the imagination into the quite different life of an
illiterate person.
I imagine David's life to be something like this . . .
''Seeing there was no-one around, he stopped in front of the community
centre notice-board on his way home and pretended to read about local
events and services. But, as always, the unyielding lines of print
defied him to penetrate their universal code. He could recognise some of
the word-shapes from his schooldays but even these were now no more than
fragments of useless childhood memory.''
The most serious effect of illiteracy is to set those who suffer from
it apart from the rest of society. Excluded from the written word,
illiterates have to engage in a lifetime of serial pretence.
Because he can't write, David -- who has been unemployed since leaving
school -- literally can't sign on to quality for unemployment benefit.
He can only make his mark. This must be a recurring and humiliating
experience for him.
To conceal his illiteracy from others he pretends to be reading the
community centre notice-board but he knows there is no way short of a
miracle he can ever have access to the information on it. Unless, that
is, the miracle manifests itself in the form of someone able to teach
him to read -- as, in one of the primary schools he attended, one of his
teachers had actually succeeded in doing.
''He could feel the darkness coming on inside his head as it always
did when he tried but couldn't think how to say the words on the
notice-board. He could hardly remember a time when there had been no
darkness. It was long ago, in Miss Nairn's class. But when Miss Nairn
left without warning the darkness started.
''At first it only lasted a few minutes, when he couldn't say the
words in his new reading book properly. In Miss Nairn's class he had
always been at the same place in his reading book as the rest because
Miss Nairn knew different ways of showing you how the letters were
joined and how to sound them to make a new word.
''After Miss Nairn left he had fallen further and further behind in
his reading and none of the other teachers seemed to know how to help.
It was the same when he went up to secondary school.''
From what I gathered, and was able to observe, about David's
schooling, that is a reasonably accurate outline of how the system came
to fail him.
The truth is that David should not be in the desperate predicament of
being unable to read or write at 20 years of age. When I met up with him
towards the end of his last year at secondary school I started him on a
reading scheme supplied by a retired teacher in which he made
encouraging progress.
Does this mean, then, that the prime reason for his illiteracy was
simply the inability -- with one exception in one of his primary schools
-- of the various teachers whose hands he had passed through to
understand and overcome his difficulties?
I want to draw attention here to the fact that one particular pupil,
whom I happen to know about, spent 11 years in our schooling system, as
it now exists, without learning the basic skills of reading and writing.
In failing to carry out its statutory duty to educate David to an
acceptable level, the education authority may well have been negligent.
But it is no compensation for an illiterate candidate to be entered for
SCE examinations with a scribe doing his reading and writing for him.

Teaching English as a foreign langauage there can be a revelation,
says Nick Harris.
HAVE you heard the myth about Japanese sizes? Class sizes, that is.
The myth says that all Japanese schoolchildren are educated in large,
tightly-controlled units; that there are no discipline problems; and
that the system is the epitome of success.
The best way to explore the myth, and find out more about Japanese
society as a whole, is to go and work there. Increasing numbers of
people are doing so, especially TEFLers (Teachers of English as a
Foreign Language).
This year, the Jet Programme (Japan Exchange and Teaching) will again
be one of the largest employers of teachers from Britain. It plans to
recruit 450 this year, on one-year contracts that are often renewable.
The programme emphasises that the ''exchange'' aspect is as important
as the ''teaching'' aspect. The main aim is to promote
''internationalisation'', a buzzword in Japan today.
Former Jet teacher Paddy McAleenan, 23, sees a valid side to this
approach: ''You're working with children, and their perspective of
foreigners is very narrow. They're subjected to American TV and culture,
and little else. We help to integrate other cultures and extend their
view of the world outside Japan.''
The teaching can be demanding, and working hours vary from school to
school. A 35-hour week is normal, but this may include only 15 teaching
hours.
Some people find the Japanese syllabus restricting. ''It can be a very
frustrating experience,'' says one former Jet teacher, ''trying to get
kids to talk when they've been reared on translation strictly based on
grammar.''
The benefits of teaching in Japan include large salaries, amounting to
3.6m yen (#22,000) tax-free for most UK participants. Fringe benefits
can include free or subsidised housing, return flights to Japan, and
numerous conferences in five-star hotels.
There can be drawbacks, however. Apart from well-publicised dangers
such as earthquakes and gas attacks (relatively insignificant in
everyday life), the main problems are loneliness, isolation, and
discrimination.
Loneliness and isolation are particularly problematic to people placed
in rural areas. Bill Falshaw, 30, spent a year in a small fishing town
in western Japan. ''There are days when you just want to go out and have
fun,'' he says. ''Then you realise there's nowhere to go within a
hundred kilometers.''
Discrimination is mostly positive, but some people do have negative
encounters. ''I had friends who were refused service in shops because
they were foreigners,'' says Nick Marriott, 25. ''I was often asked
ridiculous questions like whether we had electricity or not in Britain.
The level of naivete can be amazing.''
As a teacher on the Jet programme, one has numerous opportunities to
travel within Japan, and more widely throughout Asia. ''Foreign holidays
are something I really look forward to,'' says Aidy McGreevy, who's 26
and entering a second year in Japan. ''I've been to Thailand, Singapore
and Indonesia this year, but then again I really needed the breaks.''
Spokesperson for Jet, Suzanne Sutton, is a former teacher on the
programme. ''On a personal level, it's a very enriching experience. It
gives you a wonderful perspective on your own country and culture.''
Candidates for this year's programme should have a British passport,
have received a degree by July 1996, and ideally be aged under 35
(though the age limit is sometimes stretched).
Applicants with previous experience of living abroad are favoured for
their ability to adapt to changes in environment.
Linguistic ability is beneficial because it displays an awareness of
grammar, and other problems which learners of a foreign language may
encounter. It may also show a willingness to learn Japanese
(acknowledged as extremely beneficial, but not strictly necessary).
A Jet information tour involving visits to 47 UK universities and
colleges will end this week. Information and application forms can be
obtained by phoning (0171) 224 8896, or writing to the Jet Programme
Desk, 33 Seymour Place, London, W1H 6AT. This year's deadline is
December 8.
* Nick Harris taught in Western Japan for a year under the auspices of
the programme.

Norman Dunsmore on a framework for school-industry linkage.
CHILDREN entering primary school at the age of five are not too young
to be introduced to the world of business and industry. That is one of
the key messages contained in the document Education Industry Links in
Scotland 5-18 -- a Framework for Action, published by the Scottish
Consultative Council on the Curriculum.
Written by representatives of a wide range of business and educational
interests, it is directed at employers, school and college teaching
staff, local authorities, education business partnerships, local
enterprise companies, and careers staff.
Its stated aims are:
* To help existing partners to make priorities about their activities,
and to encourage new partners.
* To support all schools and businesses in giving their best to the
partnership.
* To underpin the partnership by providing advice on a rationale for
EIL, on benefits for the partners involved, on the place of education
industry activities in the school curriculum, and on co-ordination
within a local area.
* To support local and national action.
What principally distinguishes the new document is its attempt to
provide both a rationale based on common interests, and a structure
consisting of clearly-defined curricular activities which all concerned
can subscribe to and support.
In a section on the considerable benefits of EIL, the most significant
of those listed for employees is a much-needed ''better understanding of
modern education . . .'' which includes a welcome, but for time-cost
reasons unlikely to be realised, recommendation for more employee
placements in schools.
More contentiously, exerting ''influence on the curriculum to ensure
potential employees have (relevant) skills'' is offered as a benefit for
the company. But some educationists might not be too comfortable with
this, perhaps viewing it as interference.
The most attractive benefit for the schools will probably be ''sharing
resources such as people, equipment and consumables'' and, for teachers,
improved insights into the needs of industry, including (required)
skills, updated subject specific knowledge and resource material
development with industry.
Of the desired outcomes for pupils, only those described under
Knowledge and Understanding -- such as business and wealth creation and
principles in starting and running a business -- have a clearly
industrial flavour.
The core skills of using number and information technology,
communicating, personal and interpersonal skills, and problem-solving,
are already widely present across the primary and secondary curriculum,
and will be even more prominent on implementation of Higher Still.
Similarly, the required qualities described, such as self-esteem and
valuing others, are those which teachers have always striven to promote
and have no special place in education industry links. However, the
added emphasis the document places on these areas is worthwhile.
The most important part of the document is the planned programme of
EIL outcomes in the curriculum, ranging from primary one through to
sixth year in secondary education, organised under three headings:
* Jobs and Work
* Working Environment
* Industry
Examples are also given of activities through which these might be
delivered. The majority are already well established in the classroom
and include visits out of and visitors into school, role play, and
discussion, not to mention most parts of any good guidance course.
Although this built-in model certainly makes more educational sense
than the bolt-on alternative, some activities -- such as industrial
awareness days and enterprise projects -- can really only be organised
in an extra-curricular context.
This is also true of work experience which generally occurs at the end
of third year or in fourth year and is central to the whole concept of
EIL. As a growing percentage of youngsters are staying on at school to
the end of fifth year and even sixth year, however, some consideration
might usefully be given to moving work experience to a later stage.
Cynics or sceptics often denounce EIL, unfairly I think, as nothing
more than a sophisticated mechanism for transforming ruggedly
independent individuals into compliant factory-fodder. While the skill
and attitude requirements of industry and the workings of the free
market are certainly given their place in this document, so also are the
personal challenges of entrepreneurship, and the wider socio-economic
issues of health and safety, equal opportunities, and trade unionism.
Of real concern, however, must be the ability -- never mind the will
-- of the business world to respond appropriately to the increasing
demands which will be made of it.
About 24,000 copies of the document are being distributed to schools
and other interested parties through the education business
partnerships. Its impact and influence should be considerable.

Businesses are increasingly ready to buy in the humanskills needed for
specific roles. Geraldine Abrahamsmeets an enterprising supplier for
tomorrow's world.
THE most important assets of any company are its people, yet all too
often these precious human resources are under-used or under-valued,
costing a company dearly in terms of inefficient work practice and poor
working relationships.
It is all about fitting square pegs into square holes, according to
Shirley Smith, managing director of Steinbeck Resources which provides
personnel and human resource (HR) management support services to
companies in Scotland.
Companies not trained to recruit and select the most suitable people
for specific jobs can count the cost in terms of the disruption
experienced by the other team members or colleagues as well as in the
lost opportunity of a satisfactory recruit.
While many larger organisations are more likely to have strong
in-house personnel departments, the business environment is currently
undergoing such radical changes that increasing numbers are likely to
buy in HR skills customised to their own needs.
Shirley Smith is hoping that by the time that kind of thinking has
become the norm -- within the next five years, she feels -- Steinbeck
will be well placed as a major provider of outsourced and
consultancy-based HR services.
Clients so far have included small firms starting out with the backing
of the Local Enterprise Companies, large inward investment operations
and major organisations from the manufacturing and service industries,
including a number of multinational companies.
Before setting up Steinbeck 18 months ago, she had built a strong
track record in personnel and human resource management, putting much of
her earlier success down to being in the right place at the right time.
Her first job -- after a degree in business organisation at Heriot
Watt then a post-graduate course in Aberdeen -- was working in
administrative organisation with the Scottish Association of Youth Clubs
in Edinburgh.
Then she moved on to the GL Group, where she worked as the personal
assistant to the chief executive. Her wish to move into personnel
coincided with the company's need for a personnel manager. The staff of
the three main companies within the group totalled 160 and were involved
in manufacturing, telecommunications, and selling office products.
In 1987, she joined Avex Electronics in East Kilbride as director of
HR. The anticipated staff level of 300 grew to 1000 in four years, and
her job changed from being ''hands on' to leading a team of 12 people
involved in areas like personnel management, training, occupational
health and security.
She stayed with the company for seven years and in her last year had
the opportunity to travel in Europe and the US looking at world-class
manufacturing best practice with clients in the electronics sector, and
covering pro-active areas like team-working and quality to see how these
practices could be implemented at Avex.
With that kind of boardroom-level experience behind her, Shirley was
thrilled when the company offered some voluntary redundancies, because
it meant that for the first time in her life she had the chance to start
her own business. It was something she now felt capable of doing, and
she had the money to do it.
''Looking at the competition in terms of other consultancies and
recruitment agencies, I felt I could pull together some good people,
look after them well, train them well, pay them well and have a business
that was refreshingly different,'' she exp lains.
''Businesses of the future will be structured quite differently --
they will be more flexible in resourcing strategies but concentrate on
what they do best. Companies have already been outsourcing finance, IT,
catering and so on, so why not HR? It will be one of the major
outsourced services of the future.''
According to Shirley Smith, the advantage of outsourcing HR is
increased flexibility, an opportunity to buy in skills only when a
company needs them, making it cost-effective.
If outsourcing services is the future, so are the work practices of
this young company. It has two ''skills banks'' of employees and
associates, all operating from workstations based in their homes and
linked by computers and modems. This allows them to share software and
communicate with each other electronically through the Internet.
The selection criteria are stringent. ''Our employees and associates
must be graduates who have operated at a senior level in at least two
industry sectors in pro-active blue chip organisations,'' says Shirley.
''They must have experience of best practice in the UK at the present
time, must be easy to get on with and prepared to input at high
standards.''
Steinbeck covers areas of HR like recruitment, psychometric testing,
running assessment centres, outplacement, performance management issues,
training needs analysis.
''It involves getting to know the company and weighing up what it
needs -- that is why I have a big pool of people from diverse
backgrounds, with diverse personalities that can be fitted and matched
to the needs of the companies.
''Although we provide short-term support, it is also about building up
relationships and partnerships with companies so that they believe they
are getting the quality, service and results they need.''
Performance management skills is another specialism which ensures that
when companies introduce a performance appraisal or a performance
management system, the managers as well as the appraisees are equipped
to handle it.
Helping people to take ownership of their own development is very
important part of the work, and something to which Shirley Smith is
totally committed.
''Because careers are shorter, there is a greater need to move around
and have more flexible skills and abilities at your fingertips, so that
you are able to turn your hand to the jobs that will be available in the
future.
''The more pro-active companies have come to realise the importance of
this. They know they can't offer people jobs for life any more but they
can equip them with the skills so that they can be employable for
life.''
Practising what it preaches, Steinbeck Resources Ltd -- which has just
earned an Investors in People award -- is always looking for people
working on a flexible basis to meet short- and long-term contracts with
a whole variety of clients.
A potential employee or associate must be a member of the Institute of
Personnel and Development, a graduate, with high personal standards.
Conversely, any company looking for short-term placement can access the
pool of experienced people who can meet their needs.

WHOEVER do television schedules (they could be the same wags who
compose train timetables) have been at it again. Day is night to them.
It is their regular prank to hold back grown-up shows until after
grown-up people have toddled to bed. So at the weekend with The Big
Sleep.
After midnight was too late for an old (1946) motion picture to be out
playing.
To antique viewers who treasure the box as a movie museum was left
little choice. Somehow they had to stay bright when the street outside
went dark with something more than night. If watching Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall makes an apt midnight feast, for fans of Raymond
Chandler, who wrote the book of the film, it was tough. Not all of them
are as insomniac as was their master.
Skipping sleep for The Big Sleep was a harsh alternative. Chandler's
yarn goes away back to 1939. He toiled for three months to create it.
Could it not wait until the morning?
Troubled is the business of staying loyal to Raymond Chandler. He is
being messed about with worse than having his offspring kept up late.
Earnest efforts are being made to turn him into a stone-faced figurehead
of the literary establishment. Direly to his gun-in-the-kidney books are
being added douce layers of respectability.
Having Philip Marlowe, his private investigator hero, go down mean
streets in the wee hours, if only on the wee screen, at least helps keep
his feet in the weeds. Scholarly cleansing, however, keeps happening.
Marlowe is forever being given a fresher shirt and shinier suit of
armour.
Now his creator has been solemnly saluted as a Great American Writer.
Most of his work has been entombed in two black-covered encyclopaedic
volumes of the Library of America. He is the first crime writer to be so
hallowed.
In grouchy old age, Chandler would have spat bullets at so stuffy a
cloak. ''I'm just a fellow who jacked up a few pulp novelettes into book
form,'' he liked to say. He thought that P Marlowe had as much social
conscience as a horse. He went on: ''The trouble with the Marlowe
character is he has been written and talked about too much. He's getting
self-conscious, trying to live up to his reputation among the
quasi-intellectuals. The boy is bothered.''
Academic publication is a far country from where Marlowe was brought
up. His beginnings were in the lurid pages of a magazine called Black
Mask. The mother and father of The Big Sleep were two hack tales.
Marlowe has no mention in them. In one he answers to Carmody, while in
the other he is a man with no name. ''A shamus,'' is how he introduces
himself. ''The name doesn't matter.''
Later, he is knocked out when a tube weighted with nickels is applied
to his face. He gets asked how he feels. ''Great,'' he says, ''except
somebody built a filling station on my jaw.''
It is a rougher, truer line than the three pair of hands from the
scriptwriting department got into the film version. But even Chandler
wanted to forget the movie's genesis. Because he had recycled the two
short stories to make his first novel, he thought they should be allowed
to lie in peace. In his word, they had been ''cannibalised''. He did not
want their carcasses exposed again for public sale.
With those cheery images was the time improved awaiting the television
to warm up. Such doodling inside the head beat staring at the wallpaper,
but only just. A packet of chocolate digestives was the only wakey-wakey
nourishment to hand.
A good part of going out to the pictures used to be the waiting. There
was that magic moment on the cinema pavement when the queue edged under
the canopy out of the rain. Being permitted to pay for a ticket felt
like a privilege. Sitting through an endless travelogue about Bulgaria
became an act of preparation. Even watching a Johnny Mack Brown cowboy
film helped sharpen the anticipation of the main event.
Television offers fewer preliminaries. Waiting for the start is just
long.
When even the alfresco synod of young night people who every Friday
debate the world's problems after closing time had left the street,
there was nowt for it but to exhume Killer in the Rain and The Curtain,
the two rough stories which pupped The Big Sleep.
Not in the film, one of the novel's great lines goes: ''She was
wearing a pair of long jade earrings. They were nice earrings and had
probably cost a couple of hundred dollars. She wasn't wearing anything
else.''
Black Mask treated that vision more sparsely. How the apprentice
Chandler handled her was: ''She was wearing a pair of long jade
earrings, and apart from those she was stark naked . . .'' The rest is
oblivion. A bigger sleep set in than the movie.
When ancient viewer came awake, La Bacall had long left the room.
Evidence that she had ever arrived was only a trail of
chocolate-digestive crumbs on the carpet. It was a lonesome moment that
needed Raymond Chandler to describe.
He once had Philip Marlowe say about one of his heavier mornings: ''I
woke up with a motorman's glove in my mouth.'' What he meant had never
been clear before. But staying up late always teaches you something.

THE political debate in Britain on the linked subjects of Europe and a
single currency has brought unrelieved misery to those with a balanced
and informed interest. Many if not all politicians have been neither
balanced nor informed. Instead they have substituted hysteria,
partisanship, and a brand of irresponsible behaviour which has been
ultimately damaging to the national interest. For proof of this last
assertion we need look no further than the Governor of the Bank of
England. It should be a source of shame to some Tory MPs that Mr Eddie
George was forced earlier this year to warn them that loose and
speculative discussions on European monetary union were partly
responsible for a weakness of sterling. Unhappily, those who are pleased
to call themselves Euro-sceptics, but who could more accurately be
described as Euro-wreckers, have not held their tongues, as anyone who
listened to the Conservative Party conference could testify. We could
have assumed that Tory MPs, who are supposed to represent the party of
business and who are, moreover, popularly believed to have a good deal
of business experience, would have either listened to seasoned
businessmen on this subject or have developed more sensible attitudes.
It is true that the right-wing Institute of Directors is extremely
sceptical of the benefits of a single currency, arguing bluntly that it
would damage the national interest, but the bulk of business sentiment
appears to point in quite a different direction.
We should be grateful for the joint efforts of the Confederation of
British Industry and the British Chambers of Commerce for funding a
proper opinion poll of British business. It shows conclusively that
British businessmen are sick of shrill and badly informed debate,
believe overwhelmingly that Britain must remain part of the EU, and tend
on balance to favour economic and monetary union, although many remain
agnostic on the last point. This fits well with earlier studies of the
issue which argued in the summer that a single currency could lead to
low inflation, lower interest rates, and a stable and successful
economic climate. The reasons for approval given in the CBI/chambers
survey are essentially pragmatic: basically businessmen believe that
Europe is good for British business.
It is true that this is not a new argument but it is one which must be
repeated. A defining moment in the debate as far as Scotland is
concerned came earlier this year when Mr Major opened a Japanese factory
here and insisted that it was present because of the opportunities that
Britain offered. The Japanese management added that it was there because
of the opportunities that Britain offered within Europe. For these
reasons we have the greatest sympathy with those, like the CBI, who are
angry at the confusion and rhetoric which has bedevilled the debate over
Europe and the single currency. Europe is, quite simply, vital to our
future. The single currency could play an important part in our economic
development but it will remain necessary for the convergence criteria to
be met before it could be established in full. It is important, as the
business survey argues, that Britain is not hustled into making a
commitment to rule out British membership of a single currency in the
lifetime of the next Parliament. That would be foolish and would damage
British business in Europe which is already labouring under certain
handicaps because of the perceived attitude of the British Government.
The CBI will now produce for members a detailed and practical leaflet
setting out the issues on both sides of the argument. We wish it well
and hope that certain politicians might yet aspire to such common sense.

WHAT is all this fuss about parents taking photos of their children in
their most natural and beautiful state? Thus do my own siblings appear
in some family photographs. Both my bairns were born bare, and in the
nude did their parents unashamedly conceive them.
Neither their parents nor mine were perverts or child molesters, nor
did such thoughts remotely enter our heads. Nor were any of the boys at
school with me. Quite unselfconsciously we would swim in loch or river
as naked as the fish therein, and without one hint of indecency. Can
indecency not, after all, appear among the fully-clothed? Is the human
eye not less inquisitive about what it sees than what it does not see?
Scandinavian visitors to Scotland have also bathed in our lochs, when
the weather is warm enough, attired in their birthday suits, then
sunbathed in similar attire on the shore, only to be warned off by some
unwilling uniformed constable to whom they had been reported by some
narrow-minded native.
They behold Scots women in saunas and are at a loss to understand why
swimsuits are retained therein, and why the Scots are ashamed of their
own bodies.
Now, if the police are to be called in every time some child appears
in the nude, do we not have more than the makings of a Gestapo state? As
almost always, is it not the Gestapo who are the real criminals?

MR BLAIR has just advised the Shadow Social Security Minister to
''think the unthinkable'' and come up with some precise policies in time
for the next election. It is, however, only three years since Mr Blair's
predecessor appointed the Social Justice Commission to review social
policy comprehensively. It did so, though it was far longer on analysis
than prescription and there seemed little unthinkable about its
presentation, particularly in terms of traditional Labour attitudes. It
looks very much as if Mr Blair is simply abandoning it and starting
again but from a practical -- and immediate -- political perspective
rather than the more abstract and long-term approach embodied in the
commission. The fact is that the costs of social welfare provision are
beginning to worry many observers who suspect that they may prove to be
insupportable if they keep spiralling at anything like the rate of the
past decade. Mr Lilley, the present Minister of Social Security, is one
who shares that particular worry but there are other voices which argue
that the fears may be exaggerated.
The area is vital both for its role in supporting people in need and
in convincing those whose financial contributions provide that support
that it is necessary and desirable for them to do so. The potential
clash of interest between beneficiaries and contributors has been
identified by all political parties as a coming political issue, as has
the more obviously administrative problem of matching resources to
demand. The context is not only one where people are living longer into
an expensive old age but the scale of advance in drugs as well as
sophisticated medical techniques increases costs rapidly. Almost every
state budget for welfare is either under strain now or can be identified
as likely to encounter strain in the near future, hence the recent
stress on the need for private pension provision and the proliferation
of private medical insurance schemes. In these areas already it is
possible to see some overlap with the NHS, and this can be expected to
grow under the Tories. Would the unthinkable mean it might also grow
under Labour, especially given the way in which Bupa, the biggest
private medical insurance operation is a non-profit making charity? Or
might the unthinkable mean that child benefit should be confined to
those who need it most either by its confinement to them or by its
taxation in well-to-do hands.
The area is one where it is hard to envisage much chopping and
changing between governments. Whatever new dispensation emerges should
be expected to command much the same consensus which accompanied the
Beveridge Report and the adoptions of its main recommendations in the
late 1940s. That means that the parties should aim to establish common
ground rather than the present competing policies with very different
implications for levels of taxation. Mr Blair, for example, is thought
to want to move quickly to counter Tory attempts to deal with provision
of long-term care for the elderly which does not entail them losing
their homes (something Mr Clarke may address in this month's Budget).
The best answer may be like the Social Justice Commission, but without
its inevitable partisan base. We need a Royal Commission on Social
Welfare in all its aspects, from health and national insurance to the
links between taxation and benefits. Its main aim would be to come up
with recommendations which can command wide acceptance, not least
because popular expectations of what we can deliver collectively may be
too generous as a guide to the future. If what is delivered is not to be
reduced, its funding has to be increased, almost certainly by individual
provision (which may not be entirely voluntary).

A HIGH-PROFILE personality and a photo of a child. A blast of media
publicity from day one. People debating the innocence or guilt of that
person who hasn't even been charged. The police denying they leaked it.
More about Eric Cullen? No, it's another victim of the same old trick,
this time ITN's Julia Somerville (November 4).
Yet again, the police have been careful to caution her (suggesting
guilt) but not to charge her. That would have brought down the curtain
on reporting because of sub judice. And that wouldn't have served the
purpose of damning her on the basis that there's no smoke without fire.
Once more the police have gone for a high-profile scalp and succeeded
only in creating a high-profile scandal. They were lucky in the Eric
Cullen case that by throwing piles of muck at an abuse victim for two
years some stuck. Ms Somerville has by contrast -- and quite rightly --
gone on the offensive in attacking police methods almost immediately.
I hope her actions will demonstrate to many people what I've
encountered at close range in re-investigating the Eric Cullen case --
that publicising details of an inquiry that requires great sensitivity
completely defeats the purpose.
The tactic will not endear us to the actions of the police force but
simply and unfairly further diminish our faith in those officers who are
attempting to maintain law and order.
I've seen the tactics destroying a life. I trust Ms Somerville will
have the strength to expose just what ulterior motives lay behind the
publicity she has had to endure these last few days.

GEORGE KYNOCH'S tantrums about local government staffing and Michael
Forsyth's announcement that he is to publish local authority spending
league tables begs the question: what is the Government going to do
about that proven financial disaster, the unelected quango?
Following hard on the heels of the Highland NHS Health Trust financial
fiasco we now have an example of quango business wizardry with Ross and
Cromarty Enterprise's five-figure contribution to a Tain company that
promptly went down the plug-hole.
Messrs Kynoch and Forsyth might be interested to know that RACE and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise staff were so busy that they couldn't
even be bothered to turn up at a liquidator's meeting to ask where over
#100,000 of public money had gone.
The Tories have been bellowing about all the financial and business
expertise that their place-men (and the odd woman) bring to these cosy
little clubs. Well, where is it?
Local authorities are not all havens of probity, financial brilliance,
or top-notch management but, considering the constraints they work
under, they don't do that badly and they are accountable to the
community. If a local authority had acted in the way that the Highland
NHS Trust, RACE or HIE have, Tories would be screaming for the
resignations of everyone in sight.
What really hurts Tories is that local government is popularly elected
and democratic, concepts totaly alien to Tories in Scotland.

THE current row in Parliament about the recommendations of the Nolan
Committee centres around one particular aspect of MPs' earnings. Under
the present rules, as I understand it, if an MP, by virtue of his
position as an MP, becomes a consultant or an adviser to a particular
organisation, then he or she must disclose that interest to the House of
Commons.
Nolan and the Labour Party would go a stage further and require that
such MPs should now record publicly how much they receive in
remuneration for such work. The argument being that they would not have
found themselves in these positions had they not been MPs and, as you
pointed out in your editorial (November 2), knowing the amount is in
part a measure of their activity on behalf of the organisation.
Having spent the first 30 years of my working life as a public servant
my rate of pay was always public knowledge to anyone who could be
bothered to find out. So I have no particular quibble with the idea.
It is an infringement of civil liberties, perhaps, and for that reason
it could be argued that disclosure of the interest would be sufficient,
without a figure being put to it, this being Mr Major's point of view as
I understand it.
The same argument concerning MPs' interests must therefore apply to
those MPs who write regular columns in the newspapers where they out
forward views on behalf of their political party and for which they
receive payment.
I suggest that Brian Wilson and Alex Salmond should declare how much
they are paid for their regular columns in The Herald. At least we
readers could form a view on whether we are getting value for money.

AT 8.15 on Sunday evening my best friend died. A post mortem showed
that he died of a massive heart attack. As a witness to the incident I
can state clearly that his death was immediately preceded by the
explosion of a gigantic firework.
He died quickly but in a state of severe panic. My friend was
subjected to this experience from a small private garden. He was killed
as a direct result of uncaring, unthinking, selfish individuals who were
more concerned with their own entertainment than with any regard for
others.
My friend was a trusted companion. He protected not only my property
but everyone who lives here. His name was Ben Lucas. He was our dog. Guy
Fawkes Night murdered him.

WHAT surprises me about the articles by Jill Crawshaw is how
haphazardly she made her arrangements. To pay #250 for a
London/Inverness air fare was needlessly extravagant as there are
promotional fares for weekend travel at less than half that price.
If she wanted to sample the West Highland rail line she could have
flown to Glasgow for as little as #79.00 return and bought a ScotRail
package at #119.00 which includes rail travel Glasgow to Fort William
and two nights' hotel accommodation.
There are many country house hotels all over rural Scotland where good
accommodation and excellent food can be had for #50 to #60, dinner, bed
and breakfast.
I suspect that her travel agent was ill-informed of anything north of
Watford and could not put together an attractive and cost-effective
itinerary. She herself seems to have wandered about in a fairly aimless
fashion and the fact that it was a very wet weekend made matters worse.
Of course she is right to complain about surly service or
unimaginative cuisine but I think with some careful forward planning and
a good travel agent she might have gained a more balanced impression of
Scotland.

IT isn't much fun to be munching on your breakfast toast and then to
read that some sadistic, despicable monster has massacred 25 seal pups
in Orkney (October 30).
It didn't take these pathetic, little creatures very long to encounter
the blackest, cruellest part of the human psyche.
If I lived in Orkney I couldn't sleep or rest until the person
responsible was exposed and charged, even although the punishment will
undoubtedly be a #10 fine or 20 minutes community work.
Someone capable of this atrocity is capable of anything.

WHEN I recall the terrible prolonged sufferings of my late parishioner
Willie McRobert in Ballater, who died from ''farmer's lung'' without any
thought of financial compensation, the award of #65,000 for death from
mesothelioma makes me sad and angry.
As a parish minister for 25 years with lots of compassion for all who
suffer pain and sickness, not forgetting the sight and the plight of the
starving hordes in Calcutta in 1944, I still think the fact is that we
live in a beautiful but dangerous world where the gift of life can be
snuffed out at any moment and this gift is debased by litigation for
compensation.

WHEN are you going to get it into your heads that schizophrenia has
nothing to do with split personalities and certainly nothing to do with
taking two different approaches to one problem?
I refer to your introduction to Calum Macdonald's article on customer
service, ''Calum Macdonald advocates the schizophrenic approach'',
meaning using a nice or nasty manner as appropriate to get good service
(November 3).
Schizophrenia is a mental illness the symptoms of which include
becoming detached from reality, hearing voices, seeing hallucinatory
visions, losing one's drive and initiative, or feelings of persecution,
among others.
It does not involve having more than one personality. It is time
people stopped thinking of the illness in terms of Jekyll and Hyde.

WITH regard to Jill Crawshaw's objections to ''memorials to the
nation's past sufferings'', it doesn't seem to have occurred to her that
these memorials are primarily for the benefit of the Scottish people.
It is about time Scotland realised the dangers inherent in becoming a
giant theme park, but by all means let us improve the transport
infrastructure and give a warm welcome to those visitors who come
wanting to learn a bit more about the country and its history.

FOR the past few years my wife and I have taken autumn break holidays
in different parts of Scotland and have been extremely pleased with what
we found.
We have been extremely pleased at breaks in Ballater, at an old
coaching inn at Dunkeld, in Kelso, Hownam, St Andrews, and Broadford,
and have also spent single nights in various other hotels around
Scotland with no disasters to report. Our most expensive, most
uncomfortable, and noisiest hotel was in London.
Jill Crawshaw's articles have probably served a useful purpose but
credit should be given where it is due. There are many good, comfortable

BERT McCANN describes a caring arena in which 'bad boys' make good --
a circus school that crosses Belfast's sectarian divide.
DURING the past 25 troubled years, the performing and creative arts
has provided one of the few meeting points for young people from the
opposing sides of the divided community of Northern Ireland.
The Belfast Community Circus School, which has just marked its 10th
anniversary, has been one arena in which youngsters on either side of
the sectarian divide from Belfast and beyond could meet, and get to know
one another while sharing skills of the circus.
One of the BCCS's most important roles has been as facilitator and
supporter of new and emerging community circus groups. One of the
companies -- Circus 1-3 is made up of boys who live in the residential
care establishment, St Patricks in West Belfast. It is an open
establishment caring for about 60 young men up to 19 years of age who
are subject to Training School Orders, which used to be from one to
three years' duration -- hence the troupe's name. It is now a maximum of
two years' duration with the aim to reintegrate the boys back into the
community after less than 18 months.
Kathryn Montgomery was appointed last July as full-time development
worker after a spell as a volunteer with the company. She explains: ''In
1991 St Pats saw that there was great potential benefits in involving
the children in circus and along with BCCS set up a pilot training
programme.
''The children who live at St Pats come from all over Northern Ireland
but more usually from the local area. Most are here because of family or
social problems or they're beyond the control of children's homes. A few
have been found guilty of offences which led to them being rejected by
their community. As a result they are stigmatised as bad boys when in
reality their problem is low self esteem,'' she says.
''The arts and especially circus work is a wonderful way to stimulate
the imagination, raise self esteem and it gives the boys a sense of
control over their own lives and personal decision-making. Circus
activity helps the young people involved to see how they can go about
changing their behaviour patterns, learning what is appropriate
behaviour and most importantly how a person's actions can affect other
people.''
Miracles are worked on an annual budget of #32,000 which is provided
by the Northern Ireland Office, Making Belfast Work, the North and West
Belfast Health and Social Services Trust and Children In Need.
Aberdeen-based firm Business Air recently provided flights to the
National Association of Youth Circuses first aid course in Leed's and to
the Acrobatic Convention in Sheffield.
Seventeen-year-old Colm Murdoch, a native of nationalist West Belfast
and a former resident of St Pats, is now a paid tutor with Circus 1-3.
He lives independently in his own flat, with family relationships
restored, and he is well-qualifed to express an opinion on the
effectiveness of the scheme.
''Being involved with the circus changed me completely. I was a
frightened wee boy when I came to St Pats and Circus 1-3 brought me out
of myself and broadened my horizons.

THERE are good and bad hotels in every country, but any experienced
traveller has only him/herself to blame for patronising the latter. Jill
Crawshaw must be a singularly unfortunate traveller to have ended up in
the accommodation she describes.
With the overwhelming number of excellent places to stay at in
Scotland, she certainly shows a singular degree of ineptitude in
selecting the few places that any knowledgable person would have, by
instinct, learned to avoid.

JULIE Davidson has apparently been on the receiving end of some
Scottish Tourist Board inefficiency (November 3).
But isn't it a shame that a thoroughly Scottish newspaper like The
Herald should feel it perfectly reasonable and sensible to denigrate
initiatives like the Autumn Gold campaign before it even has a chance to
get off the ground?
Autumn Gold, which was spearheaded by Stakis chief executive David
Michels, aimed to add vitality to the industry in Scotland by increasing
tourism in October and November. It was hoped it would put Scotland on a
footing with New England as an appealing autumn-break destination.
It would be foolish to imagine that one season will reap golden
rewards. It will clearly take a great deal more voluntary time and
unpaid effort on the part of the Autumn Gold committee before solid
benefits become apparent.
In the meantime, shouldn't everyone be mindful of the fact that, while
admittedly there is work to be done, nothing will hinder that process
more than public swipes at the very initiatives needed to raise
Scotland's profile in the tourism arena?

PROFOUND gloom accompanied my reading of JillCrawshaw's articles as
her dismal account brought a shudder of recognition. I believed every
word she wrote and anyone associated with the tourist business should
take note.
I am a Blue Badge Tourist Guide and my job is to promote Scotland.
This should be easy. We have some of the most stunningly beautiful
scenery to be seen anywhere. This is our greatest asset and it comes
free.
Our history is studded with romantic characters and bloodthirsty
events. The film and television industry is exploiting this to our
advantage and the publicity also comes free.
Tartan, haggis, and even Nessie should not be sneered at. They
originated here and they represent an aspect of Scotland which is
recognised the world over. It is only to be regretted that they are so
often promoted by tawdry gift-shops and expensive heritage centres.
So what else is wrong? Just about everthing from over-priced
accommodation to over-cooked vegetables. Indifferent staff,
misinformation, illogical closing times, and gloomy, loomless mill shops
are mentioned in the articles -- but the list could go on and on.
Of course many people have experienced Highland hospitality -- and
come back for more year after year, but the fact that just one person
has such a sorry tale to tell should be of concern to us all.
I believe we could learn a lot from America. They know how to look
after visitors over there. We want them to visit us over here -- and
come back again.

IT takes more than an abundance of hope to fulfil one's ambitions if
you're a woman. It also takes guile, courage, opportunism -- and not a
little cynicism if I read Beth Henley's 1990 play right.
A slyly subversive satire on the old macho values of the wild west,
Lisa Forrell's production certainly looks great. Jeff Carpenter's
open-skied and elephant-high corn panorama with Kevin Brown's inspired
bluesy guitar score takes us straight into those days on the prairies
when a man had to do what a man had to do and women knew their place --
''a good wife, gentle and submissive'' as Myriam Cyr's gullible,
sweet-natured Bess puts it.
Beside the teasing however, and like her previous award-winning Crimes
of the Heart, Henley describes a darker side in this tale of two
mail-order brides encountering poverty, sex, and domination in 1860s
Wyoming. As Maryam d'Abo's head-strong Macon admits right at the
beginning ''I'd rip wings off an angel if it helped me fly''. She's the
one, you think, who'll flee the nest dragging Bess along with her.
But Henley has other ideas in mind. Not quite Thelma and Louise
(though the Evian-sponsored flyer encourages you to think so) Bess
becomes the lecture-circuit celebrity. Captured by Indians, her story is
touted across the nation while Macon ends up penniless, without husband
or home. Betrayed on all sides -- in friendship as much as ideals --
Bess has learnt her lessons well.
A salutary tale, Forrell's production doesn't always carry the force
it promises but Cyr's dark-eyed Bess and Corey Johnson as her initially
saturnine, then leech-like husband radiate a passionate irony.

INCOGNITO constituted more than the headlining band on Sunday, it was
the watchword. There was Branford Marsalis, a saxophonist whose
reputation over the past 15 years could reasonably be said to have
merited some superstarish swagger, disdaining as much as a name check
while leading support band Buckshot LeFonque.
Instead Marsalis let his music, and his rapper, do the talking. Tough,
bulls-eye hitting saxophone lines and tightly integrated musicianship
abounded. Over one of the set's mellower grooves The Unknown Soldier
rapped loquaciously and winningly, although he later protesteth too much
by insisting that bebop and hip-hop can co-operate since the previous
number had already proved this conclusively, with Marsalis and the
scratch deejay swopping gleeful phrases over a guitar riff that Keith
Richard might covet.
Some overwrought soul balladeering from the otherwise impressive
Stevie Wonder disciple Frank McComb aside, Buckshot LeFonque were
street-wise and bang up to the minute. Incognito, by comparison, sounded
suburban and, their assertions of good music's timelessness
notwithstanding, dated. Physically, they filled the stage with their 13
bodies, the requisite gear and assorted pot plants. Aurally, they filled
the room and had the dancers dancing from beat one.
Well-disciplined, proficient and capable admittedly of building
considerable momentum, their original music's inherent anonymity
nonetheless gives them the air of a slightly hipper James Last
Orchestra. Despite the four singers' whooping, soulful exhortations, the
most memorable song was the Isleys' Harvest for the World, with Still a
Friend of Mine a close second if only for Bluey Maunick's optimism in
believing that such a modest work, sung suitably loudly there and then,
could bring about world peace.

Mark Fisher reflects on how intense rehearsals and endless enthusiam
has gained a Perth production international acclaim.
WHEN the best-of-the-year lists are drawn up in a few weeks' time I
shall have little hesitation in putting Perth Theatre's touring
production of A Man with Connections up there at the top. You don't see
acting of this intensity every day -- volatile, edgy, emotionally
draining; on the outside it's about the institutionalised corruption of
Soviet society, on the inside it's about the painful stripping away of a
complex and contradictory relationship -- and you see every agonising
tear.
It's just entered the final week of its run (until Saturday at
Glasgow's Tron), having completed a short Scottish tour and a
three-performance stint in Pskov, in the north-west of Russia.
The play, by Alexander Gelman, was first seen in Scotland at the
Traverse Theatre in 1988 when it won a Fringe First award, and has
subsequently been seen as far afield as London and Los Angeles. Being
relatively cheap to stage with only one set and two actors, it seemed a
good one to pick up on when Perth Theatre organised a short Russian
season last autumn.
Along with another Gelman play, The Bench, which was directed by Joan
Knight , A Man with Connections was put on in Perth Theatre's studio. It
starred two Scottish actors, Kenneth Bryans and Irene Macdougall, and
was directed by Vadim Radun of the Pskov Pushkin Drama Theatre.
For the two actors it was a gruelling and radically new experience.
Radun, who had directed the play in Russia with a rehearsal period of
three months, not the three weeks standard to British theatre, arrived
with his concept worked out down to the last gesture. Far from creating
their characters in the slow, organic Stanislavsky-based style we assume
all Russian theatre adheres to, Bryans and Macdougall were given their
instructions from above, handed down in a seemingly complete package.
For the first week of rehearsal, they sat round a table while Radun,
talking through a translator, painstakingly guided them through the
play, detailing every motivation and every physical action. Only in the
second week did they get the chance to put it all to the test.
''Vadim's approach was so totally different to ours, it wasn't always
easy or pleasant, but it was never ever dull,'' recalled Macdougall in a
rehearsal diary published in Theatre Scotland magazine. ''The rigid
frameworks laid out for us, began to allow a freedom I had never
experienced before. We had to take emotional and physical risks that
began to seem almost ordinary.''
The approach was radical, but it paid off. One critic described it as
''one of the most intense and rigorously-felt pieces of virtuoso
acting'' they had ever seen in a Scottish theatre. Watched by relatively
few on that initial short studio run, it seemed imperative that more
people should get the chance to see it.
Driven by the actors' enthusiasm and drafting in assistant director
Dominic Hill to restage it, the production returned a year later,
opening in Scotland last month.
If the rehearsals were an eye-opener, the visit to Russia two weeks
ago continued the process. ''I felt like I'd lived 10 months in Russia,
not 10 days,'' says Macdougall, shocked by the country's economic chaos,
its bountiful hospitality and its curious cultural values that made her
a third-class citizen as a woman, but a first-class citizen as a guest.
She says she's never had so many bad dreams in so short a space of time,
even though she wouldn't have missed the experience for anything.
The plan had originally been to perform in Pskov, Moscow and St
Petersburg, but two weeks before departure, lack of resources led to the
cancellation of all but the one date in Pskov at Radun's home theatre.
So successful did that turn out to be that a further two performances
were hastily scheduled, vigorously attended by audiences of largely
non-English speakers.
As well as an engrossed but vocal contribution from the audience, the
performers had to cope with the theatre's scratch approach to lighting,
the technicians refusing to work from notes and going entirely on the
mood of the moment. There were endless speeches to be made -- pre-show,
post-show, you name it -- countless presents to be exchanged, and the
tactful negotiation involved in dealing with the two men and two women
in the resident company who had staked their reputation on their
performances as Andrei and Natasha in Radun's earlier productions of the
play.
''On the first night the two leading actors had had too much to drink
and during the interval they decided to have a bit of a stramash outside
Kenny's dressing-room door,'' laughs Macdougall. ''They weren't angry
with us, but they were angry with each other, because there's tremendous
competition between the two of them about who was the best Andrei. The
women who played Natasha were just lovely and seemed rather desperate to
perform it with Kenny! One of them said she enjoyed seeing Russia and
Scotland marry on stage and she felt we brought a naturalism to it that
they don't.
''There are moments when Kenny and I spark off each other very
strongly and I think that's something that they hadn't had in their
production. That's why they so wanted to do it with Kenny; they'd
probably had a very difficult time with these two rather boorish actors
that were just outside our dressing room!''
Inter-cast rivalry aside, generosity was never lacking. ''After our
first night, all the actors brought in bits of food and drink that
they'd prepared, which for us seems very easy but for them is very
difficult,'' says Macdougall, explaining that the actors hadn't been
paid for three months and the theatre's phone had been cut off along
with half the city's gas supply because the administration couldn't
afford to pay for the heating.
''It's a very adhoc system out there at the moment. We didn't know
what lights we were going to get any night and the show never started at
the same time. But there was no question that the audience and the
actors enjoyed it. There was a tremendous warmth.''
Macdougall is committed enough to this play to hope that it might be
revived again next year. She and Bryans have toyed with the idea of
teaming it with Gelman's The Bench, which Bryans did when it first went
on at the Traverse, and which would certainly make a compelling
mini-repertoire for the two of them.
''You do some plays and you think they're going to be part of you
forever,'' says Macdougall. ''Its life's not over yet.''
* A Man with Connections plays at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, until
Saturday.

heaven, there are four brands of individuality: black or white, long or
short sleeved. Twenty notes buys you a place in the gang. Simple.
So there we were, a barrowload of heavy metal fans and myself, giving
it devilish finger signs and screaming for The Maiden.
Suddenly they were upon us, five bad-assed show ponies prancing around
the stage. Maiden! Maiden! As they blasted into their latest single, Man
on the Edge, the crowd's roars turned shrill. Our bodies fibrillated in
time to the music. Maiden! Maiden!
And then we noticed that dozens of fans were on stage, singing along
to the chorus of Heaven Can Wait. A kind of Ging Gang Goolly around the
fires of hell, with Steve Harris and Janick Gere running through every
guitar cliche ever conceived. Outstanding.
Of course it couldn't last. With the first notes of Fortunes of War
from the X-Factor album, frenzied campery gave way to the odious
balladeering for which heavy metal is so justly reviled. The spell was
broken and we saw The Maiden for what they really are: middle-aged men
playing mediocre music. Sad really.

THE play opens to the strains of Ella Fitzgerald singing the song of
the title. It is, we are informed, the 18th choice in an imaginary
desert island discs list being compiled by Edward, an Irishman who has
been taken hostage in the Lebanon. Ella's angelic refrain lingers. In
Frank McGuinness's tight, well-constructed drama, which is based on the
experiences of Brian Keenan and John McCarthy, there is ambiguity about
exactly who is watching.
On a literal level it is the hostages' guards, the young, sullen,
unseen men. In this sense whoever is watching is a threat, a danger.
However, threaded through the dialogue of three imprisoned men are their
hopes of other forces looking on -- the protective gaze of a dead wife
or dead father. Not guards but guardian angels. And eventually one of
the hostages becomes one of these ghostly guardians, with his cell mates
desperately trying to find some sense of sacrifice in his abrupt murder.
McGuinness convincingly conveys the strategies employed by those in
such desperate straits, fending off boredom and terror through frantic
keep-fit, elaborate tall-tales or even the kind of pointless squabbles
which allow them to vent frustration. It's a well-scripted piece, if
somewhat stereotypical, but the cast do a good job of lifting their
roles above the level of caricature, with Thomas Gemmell as the American
doctor Adam, Tom Kelly as the prissy English academic Michael, and a
particularly fine performance from Stephen McCreadie as the loquacious
Irish journalist.
The design is uninspired and, despite its minimalism, fails to convey
a necessary sense of claustrophobia, but it's an accomplished debut
production from new company Heretic.

Music
THE white gloves and whistles brigade were out in full force as The
Shamen took to the stage. The enigmatic rapper and DJ, Mr C, started the
ball rolling with a 15-minute continuous pop-techno loop, working the
crowd into a frenzy of anticipation for the evening's proceedings.
The impromptu change of venue from the Barrowland seemed to affect
no-one save perhaps the bouncy few who had to move, crab-like, out of
their line of vision to allow their bop-tastic tendencies to take
control. But the 900 that turned up would barely have dirtied the floor
of a hall that holds 3000.
The effect of the computer-generated images at the back of the stage
didn't work quite as well as they would have at the Barrowland or indeed
as they did at the T in the Park groove tents, but to the Shamenic
followers it was not important. What was important was that The Shamen,
whose commercial sound bangs hard enough to stir the dead, are still
pleasing to the ears of those who said they were the pioneers of the
current dance scene.
The relatively recent appointment of Victoria Wilson-James, former
Soul II Soul singer, has succeeded in giving them wider scope for
variety.

SARAH VILLIERS meets Andrew O'Connor and learns some of thehigh-flying
Barnum star's dreams.
THE life philosophy of Andrew O'Connor, who takes to the stage -- and
the high wire -- tonight at the Kings Theatre in Edinburgh in the title
role of Barnum, must be ''anything they can do I can do better''.
O'Connor, who is a big name in light entertainment as a presenter of
shows like Copycats and Happy Families and who picked up plaudits for
his lead performance in Me and My Girl last year, is so driven by
ambition he practically breaks the speed limits of success.
Even during a rare break from a physically exhausting tour schedule --
eight shows a week -- O'Connor fizzes with adrenelin. During a chat with
him in a cafe in Muswell Hill, near his London home, I gulp down
espresso after espresso looking for a similar energy hit. O'Connor asks
for a weak cappuccino. This is a man who has no need of artificial
stimulants.
The 32 year old gets his buzz from showbiz, having fashioned a career
from an early age as a leading child actor for both ITV and the BBC,
clocking up appearances in shows like The Canal Children, Maiden's Trip,
Sounding Brass and Kappatoo. ''Yes, I still have the videos,'' he admits
but insists the only reason for going on a televisual trip down memory
lane would be to show them to his three-year-old son, Charlie.
He looks horrified at the idea of encouraging Charlie into a similar
career but insists he has no regrets about starting his working life so
young. The hang-ups of the child actor don't sit easily on O'Connor's
shoulders. ''Are you kidding? I loved every minute of it. I was a kid
and I had my own television series and it was like all my dreams had
come true.''
He looked for fresh dreams during his teens, developing an interest in
magic which eventually won him the Young Magician of the Year Award at
the age of 18. He toured the cabaret circuit for a few years with an act
but his magic days are definitely over.
''Go on, do a trick,'' I plead to no avail. ''No, I don't do that
anymore,'' he groans. ''I hate people who bore everyone at parties by
doing tricks.'' These days he only shows off his sleight of hand to
Charlie although he has introduced elements of his magician's training
into the Barnum act.
He has also introduced new circus tricks never seen in the show
before. It's that ''I can do better'' ethos. The spectre of Michael
Crawford looms large over this musical and O'Connor was determined not
to be outshone by a past legend. He spent eight weeks at a circus school
in Hackney in intense physical preparation for the role, losing a stone
and a half in the process.
When Jim Dale and Paul Nicholas played Barnum they didn't attempt to
replicate Crawford's feat of walking the highwire. O'Connor not only
walks the highwire, he walks it backwards. And sings at the same time.
And he not only juggles, he juggles with fire. Still singing, of course.
''It is a hard work and I'm constantly on stage. Tom Thumb's number is
usually when Barnum has a rest but I appear on stilts at that point. It
just ups the ante that little bit more, we take the show onto another
level.''
He believes the only time he can relax enough to actually enjoy his
performance is during the final number when he can breathe a sigh of
relief that he's still intact.''My favourite moment is when I've just
come down the death slide, juggled with fire -- which is very scary for
me and for the people around me even if it is great for the audience --
and then I finally just go and sit on a little elephant stand and do the
closing song, and only then, knowing that the show is over and nothing
went wrong does the tension go.''
He's philosophical about the effort and risk. ''Look, there are people
working down mines eight hours a day,'' he shrugs.
You get the impression that anything is worth the spotlight which he
admits he craves. He insists that if he ever opens a West End musical
his artistic aspirations will be fulfilled -- and his finger is in a few
pies to that end, although he's tight-lipped about the details ''in case
someone steals the idea''.
However, as well as performing he also develops concepts for game
shows, writes sit-coms, runs a television production company and admits
he would love to make films. At which stage an Oscar would be a new
goal, surely? His eyes positively glitter and he smiles in agreement.
He's a man who clearly relishes fresh challenges. Perhaps it's more a
case of ''anything I can do, I can do better.''

As yet another Hamlet prepares to give us a taste of his quality,
Jackie McGlone tells of the role's irresistible lure.
FROM my teens, I have been hooked on Hamlet. I have seen nearly all of
them since the sixties. But you always remember your first love. Mine
was David Warner, the student prince in Peter Hall's 1965 production.
Warner was tall and thin, yet he looked so frail that the merest puff of
ire from Glenda Jackson's angry Ophelia might blow him over.
He was a scruffy undergraduate in spectacles and long, red scarf, and
he lay around on the floor, lank blond hair ruffled, his cloak rucked up
like a belted mackintosh.
''It was apparent,'' sniffed the critic J C Trewin, ''that he pleased
people of his own generation enormously. Anyone's first Hamlet must be
the centrepiece in his gallery of royal Elsinore, and I suspected that
for many at Stratford, this Hamlet, with whom they could identify, was
their first. The premiere ended among storming cheers. That night, and
thereafter, crowds at the stage door might have been waiting to salute a
pop star . . . It was an hour for rebellion and Warner grew into the
centre of that cult . . .''
Since then I reckon I have seen more than 30 gloomy Danes onstage, as
well as countless film and TV versions of the most famous play in the
world -- extracts from it fill 18 columns of our principal dictionary of
quotations. People collect Hamlets. Trewin actually wrote a book, called
Five and Eighty Hamlets (a number which I hope to best before I shuffle
off this mortal coil), in which he wistfully recalled every
procrastinating prince he had ever seen, man and boy and critic.
The historian and biographer Bernard Crick is another dedicated,
serial Hamletiser. Since the war he reckons to have seen them all.
''There's none so bad I cannot enjoy and none so good I can't fault
it,'' he once confessed in the Literary Review, as he proceeded to
analyse his addiction. ''The text is just so good that when I go mad --
or feigning mad -- I will be found writing Notes Towards a Perfect
Production of Hamlet.''
The perfect production of Hamlet will, of course, bring out every
theme in full harmony, reckons Crick, and not claim to have found the
''secret'' of Hamlet -- which is not, as Olivier famously had it, simply
the tragedy of a man who can not make up his mind. Crick recalls with
varying degrees of pleasure Alec Guinness, David Warner, Nicol
Williamson, Alan Howard, Albert Finney, Ben Kingsley, Michael
Pennington, and Jonathan Pryce's raving royal.
Academic John Wilsher said, in a lecture at the Shakespeare Institute
in Stratford upon Avon recently, that the test of a good Hamlet is
whether you could bear to be trapped in a railway compartment with the
melancholy prince. His thesis being that with many another Shakespearean
hero (Henry V, for instance), you'd be reaching for the communication
cord before the end of the first iambic pentameter.
No Hamlet, even David Warner's, has impressed me as much as that of
Pryce's clinically mad prince in 1979. Here was Hamlet -- in the words
of Sir Peter Hall -- ''a mirror that gives back the reflection of the
age that contemplates it''.
This was Shakespeare filtered through the imagination of R D Laing.
When Pryce produced the voice of the ghost of his father from somewhere
deep in his guts you really didn't know whether it was just in his
imagination, or because he was schizophrenic.
I've seen a one-man Hamlet on the Edinburgh fringe. I've seen Charles
Marowitz tear the play to tatters. I've seen The Roaring Girls Hamlet.
And I've seen David Hayman giving it laldy in the nude at the Citz in
1970. All of these sweet princes, including Derek Jacobi, Ian McKellen,
Michael Pennington (Claudius in the recent Peter Hall production),
Kenneth Branagh (the first time around for his own Renaissance Theatre
Company, the second time for the RSC), Mark Rylance (in pyjamas), Roger
Rees, Tom Courtenay, Albert Finney, Steven (''I AM Hamlet'') Berkoff,
Alan Howard, Robert Lindsay (in polo-neck sweater and denims), Kevin
McMonagle (in a frock), Andrew Wilde, Phillip Franks, Ralph Fiennes,
Iain Glen, Alan Cumming (in Lycra shorts), Alan Rickman, Stephen
Dillane, Arthur Smith, and Frances De La Tour, were memorable.
For no actor, or indeed actress, can entirely fail or succeed as
Hamlet, as Giles Havergal once noted in The Herald. Indeed, you can't
make a Hamlet without breaking egos.
A glut of Hamlets? Yes, please. And now enter stage right, the latest
contender for the crown. The director Kenny Ireland opens his first
Hamlet for Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum on Friday. Only then shall we
discover whether the young Scottish actor Tom McGovern has that within
which passeth show.
I'll be there on the opening night, lest Kenny Ireland should
materialise in front of the arras before the house lights dim and
announce that his leading actor is indisposed. At which point I shall
stand up in the stalls, reveal that I am word-perfect in the role, and
ready to give Scotland its first, main-stage, gloomy dame.

As Marcella Evaristi launches an occasional series, she finds that
while men and women can converse on the big things in life, the little
things cause the problems.
I AM convinced that there are greater differences, whether nurtured or
natural, which will, like rust stains on silk, rarely shift. They show
up in life's minutiae, where mega-niggles are recognised and despaired
of on both sides.
Like surreal dreams giving up their meanings, mega-niggles are
ultimately more revealing than any rational discussion. The nearly-New
Men will give nothing away when discussing a world conference on women's
rights. And unlike their fathers' generation, they will vocally describe
their partners' -- and ex-partners' -- birth experiences, from La Leche
to the creche, beaming with remembered pride and involvement, becoming
conversational labour monitors themselves.
They will happily confer, in mixed company, on the merits of Camille
Paglia's telly programme about penises with genial ease, without nudge
or wink. But in the area of the seemingly trivial, the gender world
splits. On Really Unimportant subjects the barriers are up, for the
mega-niggle is the conduit for the subterranean murkiness of our
desires, the primal swamp of unreconstructed needs. And oh boy, and dear
girl, are they differen t . . .
The Really Unimportant Telephone
The nearly-New Man holds the strange belief that the telephone is a
simple instrument of communication, useful, in its place, for the swift
imparting of information. He lifts the receiver, dials, establishes
contact with the acquaintance of his choice and having established that
his friend is ''Fine'' his expansiveness becomes exhausted and a time,
date and venue of a meeting is decided quickly before he faints. I lie.
This is how he talks to his best friend. With others he is more
economical. If he could take the vowels out, he would.
And when he regales his friends with the story of how an ex of his
would talk for an hour on the phone to a girlfriend she is due to meet
in 30 minutes, the creche-conference-condoms-are-OK partisanship
switches to a terribly different atmosphere. The men groan and guffaw in
consensual recognition of the patent insanity of women given access to a
phone. They lift their glasses and become a sailors' chorus from South
Pacific -- listen carefully, attune yourself and you'll catch the words
-- ''she'll talk on the telephone for hours, with a pound and a half of
cream upon her face! There aint nothing like a . . . Whose round is it
anyway, lads?''
Now any normal, lightly moisturised feminist (Dames don't do that
pound and half stuff anymore . . . blocks the pores) finds it quite
unfathomable that men, who -- through social conditioning, of course --
have been taught to appreciate all things technological, cannot
therefore properly appreciate one of the most endearing inventions ever
to be respectfully cradled between earring and bra-strap.
Wham, bam, thank you -- Slam! Well, it's just no way to treat a
sensitive receiver: a receptive delicate instrument: a tremulous bridge
clearly deserving of a better spiel. The nearly-New Man just uses the
phone for his own ends. The Feminist Dame identifies with her
Lifeline-Box, and surrounds it with ritual objects to make a little
altar. The address book, the libation -- either coffee, Frascati, or
Strathmore (which can be either mineral water or the water of life,
depending on the state of the heart or the state of the thighs) -- and
the cigarettes. Some modern versions of the ceremony allow nicotine
patches instead of the latter, but call me old-fashioned, it's just not
the same.
Of course, jungle toms could crudely bang on the blunt information,
but civilised usage surely deserves, instead of rude put-downs, some
tailing-away, a tactful tangent off -- an ''a propos'' for politeness
sake at least. A little phone-play, gentlemen, please . . .
For you really don't know what you're missing. I have had intense and
guiltless discourse with international operators in the privacy of my
own kitchen. Believe me, I have regularly shared wild jokes with wrong
numbers. I have reached dismissive Moscow Ayrshire in a rushed romantic
need for Moscow Russia, but at least I got through to a future anecdote.
All expense forgotten, as if it was me that was sponsored by Acurist, I
have phoned Italy for hours to tell my mother absolutely everything
happening in my world, except how the sheriff's officers looked (funeral
director shoes, Jehovah Witness charm, a tragi-comic double act with two
straight men), but I have never been economical on the telephone.
Slammed it down, yes, but differently from him. A world of humming wires
away. Because I redial a new number immediately, and relate everything I
would have said to someone nicer.
And don't tell me all those guys phonecalling on their mobiles are
relating. They're just saying ''Catch me sitting by a phone. Like some
wired-up dame.'' Faxed-up beyond belief these people.
But I think I'd better get off this line of thought now -- some
empathetic person, vowel perfect, might be inhaling by her altar, trying
to get through to me . . .
The Really Unimportant Packing Quarrel
It is a February of neuralgia and bleak dampness, and nearly-New Man
and his Feminist Dame have decided to go on holiday. They share a sense
of impetuosity and are joined in their hip knowledge that Tenerife is
naff, but the tickets were late deal cheap, and hell, they only want the
sun, some Rioja and each other. All is well.
Fem D is having a whale of a time, choosing sun-block in her raincoat,
buying dozens of T-shirts at the touch of a Switch. Out of season
bargains beckon her like foreign waiters, unrestrained and confident of
their appeal. Her relationship with nearly-New Man, her working -- but
about-to holiday -- life, and that felt tip line through the original
price tag, all strike her as a good deal. She buys four sarongs for a
song.
Meanwhile nearly-New Man is daydreaming at his work. Holidays for him,
good holidays -- not the Rhodes-to-marital ruin vacations he had with
his first wife -- are minimalist by definition. He remembers himself
grape-picking in France, 18-years-old and wiry, his stomach flat, his
skin turning deeply brown with unctions. Sockless, suit-less, proud
owner of no suitcase, desired by every passing chic, and happy. The only
sag then was in young nearly-New Man's nearly empty rucksack. Doesn't
matter if it's only Playa de las Americas he's off to, with its time
shares and its desirable tourist architecture, he's going to travel
light and light-headed again.
So she comes home happy to pack. She hauls the suitcases on to the
bed, then lights candles, she pours herself a glass of hope. She's heard
about his dreadful holidays, she's going to redress the balance. She
feels young for both of them. Six black pairs of shoes, several silks,
cleansers, and . . .
He's back, and he is appalled. Their bed is like a Benetton shop,
piled up with the same things in different colours, none of which he
wants.
They face each other. Two wounded adverts for the wrong destination.
When he swipes the piles of newly bought cotton on to the carpet and she
begins to cry, he feels nothing, not because he's not a nice guy, but
because he's just lost youthful France for paunchy Tenerife, and because
he will never be universally desired by passing chic again.
''How many pairs of black shoes do you need for a week beside a
swimming pool?'' he bellows.
But, of course, she doesn't answer. Feminist Dame is heading for the
phone.
So, you see, the mega-niggle is the warning sign, before the
declaration of war. Ignore it at your partnership-peril. Otherwise, the
significant other may start nurturing mutinous thoughts. Which, after
all, is only natural.

* FIRST on my Christmas list this year is Shaving Fun Ken, around #10
from Mattel. Barbie's boyfriend really comes into his own with a
cut-and-come-again beard which ''girls can have fun shaving''; and it
reappears, inexorably, at room temperature. He probably hails from the
same preparatory school of real life as toy ironing boards and Fisher
Price plastic stoves. Better get used to that five o'clock shadow,
girls, although Shaving Fun Barbie might have been more educational.
Just think of the endless fun your daughter could have choosing between
strip wax, sugaring, Immac or plain old daddy's razor to keep Barbie
looking a real doll.
* THE Rowanberry Bunch would like to make you an offer you can't
refuse. Far from being the delightfully rural mobster outfit its name
suggests this Glasgow-based, five-strong singing group (plus pianist),
is looking for good causes to sing for; from opera to show songs they're
just waiting for your call on 0141 886 6923.
* NEW on the magazine stands this month is HorseWoman, a glossy
equestrian monthly wisely aimed specifically at women. While the Grand
Prix of the horse world may be dominated by men the country's stables
are run by and for women, largely through the unstinting labour of an
army of teenage, horse-mad girls. Perhaps this accounts for the
sentimental pin-up pics of handsome horses and the first part of Orlando
(the story of a girl, her horse and a seemingly impossible dream), but
why, oh why must every paragraph on the contents page end with a girlish
piece of double punctuation?!!? Nevertheless, a brave effort, and full
marks to the fashion section; about time someone recognised it's not
just your horse that needs a bit of grooming.
* NESTLING alongside is the first edition of 1st In-Line ''the UK's
first and only pure in-line skating magazine''. We're really back to
basics here; articles on what to call the sport (rollerblading is a
no-no, apparently), what to buy to start off, tips on how to fall over
and the telling phrase: ''Yes, in-line skaters are the tomorrow people''
indicate that all that's going on today, at the very beginnings of the
sport, is a frenzied buying spree. One day they'll have competitions and
outings and in-line personalities to write about, but at the moment they
have to content themselves with ultimate Rollerbabe Kim Wilde ''It's a
great way to centre yourself, unwind and get back to who you are,'' says
the blonde bombshell, wiping the sweat from her brow after a quick glide
down Venice Beach, California. ''Just having the blades on is a great
unifier.''

LESLEY DUNCAN discovers how memories of life in Nazi Germany have
informed one 'Scottish' author's writing.
MARIANNE MacKinnon has the endearing habit of interjecting the
occasional interrogatory ''ja?'' into her conversation. That and
something indefinable about her high-cheekboned face are the only clues
to suggest she is not the native Scot her name might imply.
Nor is the tall, dark-haired woman in the suburban bungalow under the
Campsies a conventional housewife. Rather she is a writer whose own life
story has been as unusual as any fiction. Those who have read her first
autobiographical book, The Naked Years, will know at least the early
part of that story. How she grew up in Germany under the Hitler regime,
came to young womanhood as the Nazi world crumbled, and -- like her
fellow German citizens -- had to adjust to all the privations and
extremities of the war and occupation years.
This remarkably candid testimony to life on the other side of what
Britons saw as the great moral crusade against evil has elicited thanks
to its author from British -- and even some Jewish -- readers for
shedding light on the experiences of ordinary Germans at the time.
The young Marianne MacKinnon came to Britain in 1948. Then, the only
work open to her was domestic or nursing. ''When I finished scrubbing
floors I got my books out,'' she recalls. Having studied English
literature extra-murally at Oxford, she subsequently trained as a nurse
in Windsor and met her Scots husband when working in a British military
hospital in Germany.
Marriage in 1957 was followed by years in Hong Kong -- where her
husband was in British Intelligence -- and the Continent. Her three sons
were educated at Dollar Academy and Glasgow University. And it was to
Scotland she came when her marriage broke down in 1979.
She worked until her retirement in the modern languages department at
Strathclyde University and only then did the poet and short-story writer
take to more ambitious writing. The Naked Years (which won the Constable
Trophy of the Scottish Association of Writers) was followed by a second
book of autobiography, The Alien Years. ''I wrote this,'' she says,
''because I had so many readers' letters asking for a sequel.
''I thought, why shouldn't the British reader know what we felt like,
the first young Germans coming over at a time when every German was
still a Kraut or a bloody Nazi?''
Then, the past exorcised, came the fictional The Deluge, set in
Florence.
Marianne MacKinnon has published her latest book herself, after
commercial publishers praised it but were not sanguine about its
profit-making possibilities. Their timidity may well prove misjudged.
It's a thriller. The ending of the Cold War hasn't discouraged such
books, merely diverted them into ever more ingenious plots. Marianne
MacKinnon is not a second Le Carre but she brings special authority to
writing about Germany, East and West, past and present.
Her new book's title The Quarry is a play on words, indicating at once
the focal point of the plot and describing the plight of the middle-aged
heroine, Christa.
The plot of The Quarry may well seem its least convincing feature,
involving as it does Christa's search for family silver buried in a
suitcase in the aforementioned quarry in the former GDR. As it happens,
much of the background and many of the subsidiary characters are based
on real life.
Stretching credulity, however, is the notion that the selfsame
suitcase should now hold sensitive documents about the disbanded secret
police. Add the ingredient of a noble, persecuted, lonely East German
writer, and a happy outcome of some banality might be foreseen. It's a
tribute to Marianne MacKinnon's intelli and flair with her adopted
language that the book is so much better than this framework might
suggest.
Christa's widow's bleakness is described all too convincingly: ''You
could plug all the holes in your life, Christa thought, but those raw,
solitary moments still kept dropping in as from a desolate landscape
where even the gods were absent.''
There are more tangibly desolate landscapes as Christa journeys
through the former East Berlin. There is no room for nostalgia about the
old regime in the description of neglect and dereliction.
Christa develops as more than than a fictional convenience. Her escape
from the old Stasi men through woods and ditches, by foot and bicycle,
is like something out of The Thirty-nine Steps (a compliment). There is,
however, one rather startling scene when she is mystically ravished by
moonlight while sneaking a nocturnal dip in a lake. Indeed, a candour
about sexual desire in the middle-aged runs through The Quarry.
Before the ending with afternoon coffee and cake, German-style, the
heroine has to endure further adventures and is even immured in a
convent, while a priest who used to be an MI5 agent, resolves the
situation. This apparently improbable character is based on a former
colleague of the author's husband.
Marianne MacKinnon made herself experience life in a convent to write
about it.
She says of herself, ''My whole life has never been made easy but
inside I feel very strong and still have my faith.'' She finds a
Wordworthian kind of peace working in her garden -- though it is lines
from Keats that she stretches for: ''Beauty is truth, truth beauty . . .
I'm always looking for beauty though it doesn't always hide the ugliness
in life.''
She has carved the garden herself from a sloping site originally
disfigured by builder's detritus. Its trees and shrubs, now covered in
the multi-hues of autumn, set off late roses to effect even on a dank
autumn afternoon.
Mrs MacKinnon looks out on her little domain with the same clear-eyed
view she brings to her next decade, sustained by the appreciation of her
public and by her own robust and positive outlook on life and
creativity. ''I haven't made much financial gain,'' she says of her
writing. ''Readers' letters are my reward -- and personal
satisfaction.''

Hillcrest Books at #14.95.

magistrate yesterday.
Boualem Bensaid, 27, convicted in his absence in Algeria of a 1992
airport attack which killed nine people, is a suspect in French bombings
that have killed eight people and injured hundreds of others since July.
Police believe Bensaid telephoned Abdelkader Benouif, the alleged
mastermind of the bombings who was arrested in London at the weekend, to
report on the French bombings.

Barclay McBain reports on a headmaster's hi-tech move to turn the
tables on truants.
PUBLICATION next month of the latest school-by-school tables of
attendance and absence rates will reopen the debate about the true
extent of truancy in Scottish education, and about the way it should be
classified.
Truancy does polarise views, but common ground tends to be found on
the sort of non-attendance which most disrupts schools. According to a
survey of young people who left school in 1993, nearly two-thirds
admitted that they had played truant. About half said they had skipped a
lesson now and then. And Scottish secondary heads reported in 1991 that
50% of their pupils were truants.
As Cameron Munro, director of the Scottish initiative on attendance
and absence, pointed out yesterday: ''The biggest issue for
non-attendance is skipping individual classes.'' This might involve a
pupil going home to complete a piece of work which she's to hand in
later in the morning; another deciding to slip out of school because he
doesn't like his next period teacher; or a third truanting because he
hates PE.
Truancy increases the further up the school you look. It is readily
detectable in the primary sector because pupils do not move from class
to class but it worsens after second year in the secondary sector, when
pupil groups move about in line with their Standard Grade subjects. And
keeping tabs on sixth-year pupils who enjoy flexi-time which allows them
to come into school when they have classes can be a nightmare for heads.
The present system for monitoring attendance throughout the day in the
secondary sector depends largely on teachers who complete morning
registers, which are then collated. Teachers continue the monitoring
process by checking the register each time the class changes. It is
time-consuming, cumbersome, and not particularly efficient, as Alan
Cameron, head of Ellon Academy near Aberdeen, discovered when police
investigated an incident involving drugs.
It was said to have happened when the pupil should have been in
school. ''I spoke to three teachers. One said he wasn't in that class
but he was, while two said he was in theirs, but he wasn't. That
highlights the whole issue of accountability.''
Ellon Academy, one of Scotland's biggest schools with 1700 pupils, is
a high-achieving establishment but Cameron decided that something had to
be done after half of his fourth and fifth years reported in a survey
that they had been short-term truants.
And last year's attendance tables showed the school had a
higher-than-average absence rate of 10% among fifth and sixth years.
''That was a cause for concern,'' said the head. Under standard
monitoring, period-by-period truancy was, at best, being picked up the
next day. Now, however, the school is literally taking a swipe at
truancy in fifth and sixth years, where the problem is worst.
The school secured funding of #10,000 from Grampian region to install
an electronic registration system in those areas used by fifth and sixth
years which works in tandem with its computerised administration set-up.
The pupils are issued with personalised, credit-card style cards which
they ''swipe'' through electronic card readers under teacher supervision
each time they change period. The teacher's card also goes through to
signal the beginning of the lesson. When the class ends, pupils and
teacher are automatically ''swiped out''.
Each ''swipe'' is passed along the line to the school's central
computer, which enables the school to track down a fifth or sixth year
at any time of the day. It allows the school to analyse attendance
trends, right down to identifying pupils who regularly leave class to go
to the toilet -- for a cigarette. And it picks up on instances of
teacher late-coming.
''The system doesn't lie. It tells the time that pupils come in. They
know they can no longer get off with missing classes,'' Cameron
explained. No pupil or teacher has come to the head with any civil
liberties concerns. And he is in no doubt that the system has reduced
truancy at the top of the school. ''This system works well. It is a much
better, more effective, and more efficient registration system.''
Not surprisingly, other heads are interested. But cost is the big
hurdle -- #10,000 would buy half a teacher for a year. The system,
however, has saved the equivalent of the time of more than one full-time
teacher which would otherwise have gone on standard registrations
throughout the school.
The swipe system is being assessed by the region and Cameron hopes
funding will be available to extend it to all pupils. Only then will he
be able to put his hand on his heart and declare with utter confidence
that he knows such and such a pupil was in school at such and such a
time.

THE outcome of an extradition case involving leading IRA men in a
Dublin court could have an enormous impact on the fragile ceasefire in
Ulster.
If a Dublin district court judge refuses to extradite Nessan Quinlivan
and Pearse McAuley, who escaped from Brixton Prison four years ago,
relations between the British and Irish governments will come under
severe strain.
The rejection of the extradition application would enrage the right
wing of the Conservative Party and the Ulster Unionists. Such a decision
would revive taunts that Dublin remains soft on IRA terrorists.
But if the judge orders their return, this move could fuel strong
anti-British feelings among IRA hardliners at a critical time when Sinn
Fein remains at loggerheads with the British Government over the
decommissioning of paramilitary arms and ammunition.
The opening of the extradition case in Dublin yesterday coincided with
talks in Jerusalem between Prime Ministers John Major and John Bruton on
the stalled peace process.
Tomorrow senior British and Irish officials will meet in London in a
new attempt to agree on a formula for the holding of all-party talks in
Northern Ireland. There was notable nervousness in Dublin political
circles yesterday that the court case will add a new chapter to a long
series of extradition failures that have soured relations between London
and Dublin over the past decade.
Quinlivan and McAuley were among four IRA prisoners given early parole
yesterday morning from Portlaoise jail in the Irish midlands. Detectives
arrested the pair at the prison doors and they were detained on
extradition warrants sent by British police last week.
They were brought before a special sitting of the Dublin district
court. Both IRA men were served with four extradition warrants issued
from the Old Bailey and Bow Street magistrates court. The warrants
specified that the two are charged with conspiracy to murder Sir Charles
Tidbury, a brewery boss, as well as conspiracy to cause explosions. They
also face prison escape charges. The two were remanded to Mountjoy Jail
and were ordered to reappear in the district court in seven days' time.
The importance attached to this case by the IRA was evident from a
protest outside the court organised by groups campaigning for the
release of political prisoners and for an end to extradition of
Republicans to Britain or Northern Ireland.
Irish Government officials said last night that they were confident
that legislation introduced in 1994 had removed a notorious loophole
which had enabled terrorists to escape extradition to Britain by
claiming that their crimes were politically motivated to secure a united
Ireland. This followed the embarrassing release by a Dublin judge of
Joseph Magee, 27, from Armagh on the grounds that the murder of a
British soldier in Derby in April 1992 was politically motivated.
In a controversial judgment, Mr Justice Fergus Flood said that the
Irish National Liberation Army had claimed responsibility for ''the
carefully planned assassination, and that the weapon used was a
non-automatic gun which indicated that the killing had not posed a
collective danger to life''.
The judge also claimed that Magee would not have received a fair trial
in England on account of ''lurid and sensational coverage'' in the
media.
In a number of other high-profile cases extradition was refused on
grounds that pre-trial publicity in Britain would militate against a
fair trial.
The new spirit of co-operation between London and Dublin in recent
years contrasts sharply with the low point in relations when in 1988 the
Irish Attorney General rejected a warrant for the extradition of a
Catholic priest, Father Patrick Ryan, believed to be a central figure in
the IRA's international fundraising network for arms and ammunition.
This refusal provoked the then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to
accuse the Dublin Government of ''a lack of resolve'' in the battle
against terrorism.
But the Irish Attorney General insisted that remarks by Mrs Thatcher
and others about the priest, along with ''inflamatory'' coverage in the
British media, put his chances of a fair trial at risk.
Yesterday's release of Quinlivan and McAuley was part of the Irish
Government's policy of early release for IRA prisoners. Since the
calling of the IRA ceasefire 14 months ago, Dublin has released 36 IRA
prisoners.
But yesterday was the first time IRA prisoners were released without
advance publicity. This caution reflects the current tensions between
the two governments over the next step of the peace process in Northern
Ireland.
The early release of prisoners is seen as the key issue in the peace
process as a result of the emphasis placed on it by the Provisional IRA
in the early stages of negotiations.
But once again a controversial courtroom decision on extradition could
upset the calculations and secret diplomacy of the politicians.

Ottawa
POLICE guarding Prime Minister Jean Chretien took six or seven minutes
to respond after his wife reported a knife-wielding man had broken into
their official residence, it emerged today.
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Phil Murray said the
Mounties had launched an inquiry into how security at the 24 Sussex
Place residence could have been so grossly violated and how this could
be prevented in future.
''Quite clearly the fact this incident occurred is completely
unacceptable,'' Murray told a news conference. ''Our operational
procedures require an immediate response.
''We're going to get to the bottom of it and determine why there were
shortcomings in security and, most importantly, to make sure this kind
of incident doesn't recur in the future.''
Coming only 12 hours after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was
assassinated, the incident shocked Canadians, and federal
Solicitor-General Herb Gray said he was expecting a thorough report
within the next two weeks.
''There have already been enhancements of security measures at 24
Sussex in light of the incident,'' Gray told reporters, adding that this
was the first incident of its kind.
A 34-year-old convenience store worker, Andre Dallaire, was arrested
in the break-in. The Chretiens were unhurt.
Daillaire, 34, of Longueuil, Quebec, was charged with breaking and
entering, being unlawfully in a dwelling, and possession of a weapon. A
court appearance was delayed pending a psychiatric assessment.
Although Dallaire is from the French-speaking province of Quebec,
where a sovereignty referendum failed last week, police refused to
speculate on whether he had political motives.
The break-in highlighted a string of security shortfalls.
Mounties on guard first surrounded the house in an apparent attempt to
stop the intruder's escape before entering and arresting Dallaire six or
seven minutes after Aline Chretien's call. The delay drew heavy fire
from local media.
Police, without giving details, said the intruder was on the grounds
of the official residence for at least 44 minutes, most of that time
undetected. He was able to break a glass door -- the noise that alerted
Mrs Chretien -- without triggering any alarms.
When Mrs Chretien came face-to-face with the man, who was armed with a
jackknife, she quickly slammed a door on him and locked it before he
could enter. Chretien, who left yesterday for Rabin's funeral, praised
her cool reaction.
Officials said no officers had been suspended. A senior RCMP agent,
unconnected with the premier's security, is making the inquiry.
In the Montreal suburb of Longeuil, Sergeant Normand Landry said
Dallaire had no criminal record. His family reported him missing and he
was wanted for questioning regarding a small sum of money that was
missing from the convenience store where he worked.--Reuter/AP.

With the failure of fragmented policies in the drugs battle, Dr Ian
Oliver advocates a concerted frontal attack.
LAW enforcement has manifestly failed to deal with the problem of
illegal drugs and the United Kingdom is awash with everything from
cannabis to crack cocaine; drugs are freely available to anyone who
wants them in almost every location in the country.
There have been some spectacular successes on the part of law
enforcement officers whose continued hard work and dedication in
combating this evil is unfailing, but the problem is one of dealing with
a Hydra-headed monster: cut off one head and two more spring up in its
place. The rewards for the dealers and suppliers are so huge that almost
any risk, including death, is seen to be worth taking to peddle this
trade.
Similarly, the harm/demand reduction programmes have not had the
success that most people would wish. Huge amounts of money have been
spent on treatment, needle exchanges and education packages and still
the demand for drugs is unquenchable. So what has gone wrong? First
there is a whole generation of people who are either ignorant of the
extent of the problem and its terrible consequences or they are
indulging in a ''denial syndrome'' which refuses to recognise that there
is anything to be concerned about.
There are several advantages to this in that if one denies a problem
then there is no obligation to address it: time and money does not need
to be spent in dealing with the issue and, most advantageous of all, one
cannot be blamed for it.
Second is that although there are many excellent initiatives ongoing
by some concerned and dedicated people, and although central government
has belatedly woken up to the enemy within every community, the
responses lack co-ordination; they are fragmented and too often work in
ignorance or disregard of one another.
Dangerous drugs are probably the biggest single threat to the fabric
of our society and the problem has to be combatted in a major, united,
and co-ordinated manner or we are destined for disaster. We cannot fight
a major enemy by dissipated skirmishes -- we need a sustained and
co-ordinated frontal attack. It is not good enough to give money to
local agencies or drug action teams and expect them to be able to tackle
a national problem.
That is rather like scattering a thousand-piece jigsaw on the floor
and expecting everyone to see the picture.
There is a cogent argument for the appointment of either a national
''Drug Czar'' or a minister with a specific portfolio to bring together
all the pieces of the jigsaw; to create a national co-ordinated strategy
and to enable local people to react accordingly.
There is an appalling ignorance of the extent of the problem with
parents, in schools, and in the workplace. It is incumbent upon central
government to ensure the availability of information and guidance for
every parent through GPs, clinics, health visitors, local drugs
information consultants, so that a properly informed home environment
that understands the nature of the world in which the young are living
can be created.
Every educational institution from kindergarten to university should
teach, as part of a core curriculum, ''skills for living'' courses which
address substance abuse. It is not good enough to appoint one guidance
teacher in a school -- the whole staff should know and understand the
problem and deal with it in a caring manner.
It is necessary for every employer to adopt an employment policy which
addresses alcohol and drugs abuse. Any employer who does not believe
that substance abuse is affecting his business is naive. There is a
legal and moral obligation to face up to the responsibility of business
and, where safety is involved, that employment policy ought to include
the possibility of ''random'' testing -- either ''with cause'' or where
public safety is involved. Such testing is common in the United States
and is not regarded as an abuse of civil liberties.
Legislation and funding must be wholly appropriate to the need.
Failure to recognise the devastating consequences of allowing this evil
to flourish will result in the United Kingdom becoming a seriously
damaged country both economically and socially.
''All that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good people do
nothing.''
* Dr Ian Oliver is chief constable of Grampian Police.

Derek Reid, chief executive of the Scottish Tourist Board, reponds to
the controversy evoked by The Herald tourism series.
IT is perfectly proper, indeed healthy, for The Herald to focus so
much coverage in the past week on tourism, arguably Scotland's largest
industry. What has been missing from the debate, however, is any
acknowledgement that the industry is aware of its problems and is
starting to face up to them.
We believe that 1995 will turn out to be one of the best tourism years
we have enjoyed for some time. But there is no mood of
self-congratulation at the Scottish Tourist Board or in the industry at
large.
Your editorial on November 1 asserted that the Scottish tourist
industry ''had a mountain to climb''. Your editorial on November 4
suggested that the STB ''must show the way''. I agree. But you need look
no further than our annual report published in July to see plenty of
evidence that these issues are recognised and are beginning to be
tackled.
Serious and professional people in the industry -- at all levels in
all sectors -- do not deserve to have their recent achievements
overlooked by your newspaper. As it is time to introduce some
perspective and some balance into this debate, I offer this appraisal of
Scottish tourism's problems and the solution to them.
The patient is not terminally ill. Scotland's tourism assets are world
class and they are familiar to all of us. Our scenery, our heritage, our
culture and our activities. But these assets have not been supported, in
general, by world-class service, hospitality, and cuisine. Indeed, we
are an awful long way from achieving these goals, although there are
many places in Scotland where service, hospitality, cuisine, and
marketing are on an outstanding level.
It is noteworthy that your own series on tourism was published in a
week that began with the Scottish Hospitality Industry Congress and
ended with the Thistle Awards in Tourism -- the former an industry at
which these issues were discussed; the latter a gala evening to
recognise and celebrate those people who are delivering best practice.
Declaring our aspiration to be a world-class tourism culture is one
thing. Achieving it is quite another. This is a long war, fought on many
fronts, and against opposition that is well organised and well
resourced. It will take time. There is no instant remedy available.
The STB alone will not deliver the industry into this happy state of
affairs. Improvements in marketing, training, accommodation,
hospitality, cuisine, infrastructure, transport, and information are
necessary.
We shall require the continuing and indeed increased co-operation of
government, local enterprise companies, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands
and Islands Enterprise, local authorities, area tourist boards, trade
bodies and the private sector, as well as from millions of Scots men and
women who realise that tourism is, perhaps, the only industry in parts
of Scotland with the potential to create and safeguard jobs on a
meaningful scale. This message also needs to be adopted and understood
in our schools, our colleges and our universities -- and by the media.
This process began with the National Tourism Strategy presented by the
Secretary of State and the Minister for Tourism in 1993. It recognised
the problems Scotland was facing, as well as the opportunities, and
realigned the responsibilities for its promotion and support.
Essentially, the STB assumed responsibility for marketing Scotland,
with the local enterprise company network taking on the role of
financial assistance to tourism projects and the delivery of training at
a local level. More importantly, over the past two years the industry
has united behind new initiatives in a way that would have been
considered fanciful only a few years ago.
We have gone back to the drawing board and asked ourselves searching
questions. And in our marketing we have opted to give consumers what
they want (based on research) rather than what we think they want. This
whole process was as exhaustive as it was thorough -- and it has led to
a raft of new proposals and initiatives that will begin the process of
re-positioning Scottish tourism industry.
Among these are:
* Tourism Training Scotland -- An industry-led initiative offering a
wide range of courses to tourism businesses at local level through the
SEN/LEC network. Chaired by Peter Lederer, managing director, Gleneagles
Hotel.
* Autumn Gold -- A marketing solution to the problem of
''seasonality'', backed by STB advertising, in the form of special
offers to consumers in October and November. Chaired by David Michels,
chief executive, Stakis plc.
* ''When Will You Go?'' -- An STB advertising campaign in England
designed to present Scotland to younger consumers and ''up-weighted'' in
the Carlton and Granada areas.
* ''It's Your Country, Try It!'' -- A parallel campaign to persuade
Scots to discover the country on their doorstep.
* The Natural Cooking of Scotland -- An initiative designed to ensure
that more of Scotland's natural larder stays in Scotland and is
presented in a simple but appetising way. Chaired by Ken McCulloch of
One Devonshire Gardens and Malmaison.
* Signposting -- Pointing visitors in the right direction by
simplifying and clarifying road signs is the task of this working party.
Chaired by Philippa Grant, STB board member.
* Activity Holidays -- Promoting world-class activities by bringing

* Introduced new consumer advertising campaigns to France, Germany,

* Developed promotions with 20th Century Fox and United International
Pictures to maximise the impact for tourism of Braveheart and Rob Roy.

business, conference and incentive travel.
* Hosted 409 travel writers from the UK and overseas whose coverage
was worth #8.1m in advertising equivalence.
Make no mistake, these initiatives represent radical and fundamental
change to the industry's historical methodology. But I am confident, and
more importantly the industry is confident, that they will lead, over
time, to meaningful change. They will not, overnight, eradicate poor
service, poor food and poor facilities. But they will lead us, over
time, to a state of affairs where such things are as rare as they are
unacceptable.
Incidentally, I assume that when the STB insists that participation in
its grading schemes is a condition of entry into our publications and
that only graded establishments should be members of area tourist
boards, that we can rely upon the support of your newspaper.
It is yet another step, designed to improve the quality of our
product, along the road to a world-class tourism culture.

Geneva
THE British-born former wife of the Aga Khan, Princess Salimah, today
won a court's permission to auction #10m worth of sumptuous jewels.
However a lawyer for the Aga Khan -- one of the world's richest men --
immediately said he might appeal in a bid to halt the sale, planned for
next Monday at Christie's in Geneva.
The featured piece is a deep blue, heart-shaped diamond of 13.78
carats called the Begum Blue, which is expected to fetch more than #6m.
About 250 jewels are in the collection, many of them designed for the
princess by famous jewellers such as Van Cleef and Arpels, Cartier, and
Bulgari.
The Geneva court lifted a temporary restraining order issued at the
request of the Aga Khan last month. The judges ruled that his right
under the couple's divorce deal of first refusal to buy a portion of the
jewels would be protected under the auction plan.
The jewels were given to the princess by the Aga Khan, members of his
family, and others. The Aga Khan and the princess, the former fashion
model Sarah Croker-Poole, were married for 25 years. Their divorce
became final last March.--AP.

Paris
A FAILED French writer who shot dead Nazi collaborator Rene Bousquet
to gain public attention went on trial for murder today, repentant but
fulfilling for a few days his ambition of grabbing the headlines.
Christian Didier, 51, shot Rene Bousquet two years ago, months before
the 84-year-old former police chief for the war-time collaborationist
Vichy regime was to go on trial for his role in the deportation of tens
of thousands of Jews from France.
Repentant, Didier told the Paris assize court: ''Killing a human
being, even the worst of bastards, is horrible.
''I was convinced I had erased a dark stain on France and I realised
that killing is monstrous,'' he said.
Didier, who had previously staged bizarre publicity stunts, had
expected applause for the June 1993 assassination.
Instead he became the object of widespread scorn, among leaders of the
Jewish community also, for robbing France of the long-awaited trial of
Bousquet, who was the highest-ranking Vichy official still alive.
Didier has said he posed as a messenger bringing court documents in
order to gain entry to Bousquet's home. When Bousquet opened the door,
he shot him five times.
He faces a charge of premeditated murder, carrying a possible 30-year
prison sentence. Doctors declared him sane despite a history of
psychiatric trouble.
Didier told the court he had been traumatised in the womb by the
Second World War before being born in 1944.
His widowed mother Marie-Therese Didier, 77, with whom he lived in
Saint-Die, told the court he had wanted to avenge war victims.
''In Saint-Die, they tell me he cannot be punished, taking into
account who he shot,'' she said.
Didier had earlier been given a four-month prison sentence for
entering the Lyons prison of the late ex-Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie with
a firearm, disguised as a doctor.
Some 75,000 Jews were deported under Bousquet's authority as Vichy
police chief. He is held directly responsible for a June 1942 two-day
round-up of more than 12,000 Jewish men, women and children. Only a
handful of these survived death camps.
Bousquet was tried for minor crimes after the war, then won
rehabilitation and even became an acquaintance of ex-president Francois
Mitterrand.
Another former Vichy official, Paul Touvier, was jailed for life last
year over the execution of Jewish hostages by German forces in
Rilleux-la-Pape, near Lyons.
A third former Vichy official, Maurice Papon, has been charged with
crimes against humanity but has so far managed to avoid trial.--Reuter.

THE brother of Rabin's killer prepared a dumdum bullet used to murder
the Israeli premier, police told a court yesterday.
''Hagai Amir took a bullet, drilled a hole in it, and turned it into a
lethal bullet which causes far more damage than a regular one,'' a
police officer said.
A Tel Aviv magistrate ordered 27-year-old Hagai, arrested on Saturday,
held in custody for another seven days.
At an earlier hearing, his 25-year-old brother Yigal confessed to
killing Rabin at a peace rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday. He was ordered
held for 15 days.
Yigal told the court he acted alone but at the later hearing for his
brother, the police officer said detectives believed Hagai ''was a
willing accomplice in this assassination, even if he only failed to
prevent the crime''.
''On the day of the incident, they both sat and watched television and
Hagai saw Yigal leave. We believe he knew where he was going and didn't
try to stop him,'' the court heard.
Police said one of the bullets the brother prepared was taken out of
Rabin's body in Tel Avi's Ichilov Hospital the night of the killing. --

Washington
THE Bosnian peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, are in crisis over demands
that two prominent Bosnian Serbs be turned over to the war crimes
tribunal in The Hague.
Radovan Karadzic, president of the so-called Serb Republic of Bosnia,
and General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb army, are
accused of serious war crimes.
The Bosnian Government and the Hague tribunal have demanded that they
be brought to justice immediately, and the Americans have insisted that
they be removed from all positions of authority, as a first step to
putting them on trial. So far, the Serbian leader, President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, has refused both demands.
Mr Milosevic has taken upon himself the role of negotiator for all
Serbs, meaning that he is ready to force the Bosnian Serbs to accept the
best terms he can get, however distasteful.
He has apparently abandoned all hope of recovering the lands lost in
Croatia in August, and is prepared to jettison Mr Karadzic and General
Mladic. In exchange, the sanctions that have crippled Serbia would be
lifted.
However, arresting the men and handing them over to trial would be a
hard pill to swallow. General Mladic still has a large force under his
command, and both retain the loyalties of most Bosnian Serbs. They can
both be expected to resist extradition by all means at their disposal.
Mr Milosevic has reportedly agreed that they should be handed over,
but only after they have been tried and convicted. This is seen by the
Bosnians and Americans as a means of evading the demand entirely.
Meanwhile, the direct talks between Serbia and Croatia on the return
of eastern Slavonia have stalled. It is possible, therefore, that the
peace talks will break down entirely and war resume.

United Nations
LIBYA said today that President Bill Clinton, by calling two suspects
in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing criminals, had confirmed they could not
get a fair trial.
''For the American president, the highest authority in the land, to
describe the two suspects as criminals, before they are convicted in a
court of law, is extremely grave,'' Libya's UN mission said.
''It means that he has convicted them before they are tried. This is
reason enough for the suspects to refuse to stand trial in the United
States or Scotland, where they have been already convicted by the
highest officials.''
The statement referred to Clinton's remarks on Saturday at Arlington
National Cemetery near Washington where he dedicated a memorial to the
270 victims of the bombing, for which two alleged Libyan agents have
been indicted in the United States and Scotland.
Clinton said during the ceremony: ''We must never, never relax our
efforts until the criminals are brought to justice.''
1  Libya has offered to allow the suspects to be tried under Scottish
law, before a Scottish judge, at the World Court at The Hague, but
Washington and London say this is not acceptable.
Libya's statement urged the Security Council to lift the ''unjust
sanctions'' and to call on the US and Britain to agree to a trial at The
Hague or in a neutral country.--Reuter.

Berlin
GERMAN police commandos stormed a Berlin day-care centre today and
freed unharmed two children held hostage by an armed man for nearly
three hours.
The 29-year-old man had barricaded himself inside the centre in the
city's Koepenick district with five children between four and six.
Police were able to evacuate other children and employees from the
centre when the man, who lives locally, was distracted.
After police sealed off the area, the unemployed locksmith released
two children two hours into the ordeal. He later freed another child
carrying a demand that he speak to his sister.
Police stormed the building half-an-hour later and took the man into
custody.
It was the second hostage drama in the German capital in a week. Last
Tuesday, German police commandos freed four hostages held for two hours
by a gunman who holed up in a car rental agency after robbing a bank.
No-one was injured although shots were fired.--Reuter.

ISRAEL'S Shin Bet secret service yesterday launched an investigation
of the massive security failure that led to the assassination of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Questions are being asked about why Rabin was not wearing a
bulletproof vest, how bodyguards let an armed man get so close, and
whether security agents were paying enough attention to the threat from
right-wing Israeli extremists.
Rabin's widow Leah told Israeli television that she did not believe
security agents ever offered her husband a protective vest but that he
would have refused to wear one.
''I never heard of the words 'protective vest'. I don't think anyone
suggested it to him and I think that if they had, he would have said,
'Please, guys, be real','' said Mrs Rabin.
She added: ''He never felt threatened.''
The Shin Bet yesterday set up an internal committee that included two
of its former directors, a civilian lawyer, and a military investigator.
Israeli media said acting Prime Minister Shimon Peres was expected to
order an independent probe soon.
Yaacov Perry, a former Shin Bet chief, told army radio that a
preliminary report had already been handed to the current boss of the
secret service, who is known only as ''K''.
''There is no solution for the man who decides to act alone,'' Perry
said.
The independent commission is expected to be headed by the same
retired supreme court judge who oversaw the probe into the Hebron mosque
massacre in February 1994.
Assassin Yigal Amir has said he killed Rabin to halt the Mideast peace
process.
Amir had links to right-wing extremists, including the leader of Eyal,
an offshoot of the anti-Arab Kach party founded by the late Rabbi Meir
Kahane.
In recent weeks, angry debate over the future of the West Bank has
spilled into the streets, with right-wingers heckling Rabin at public
appearances and calling him a ''murderer'' and ''Nazi''.
Rabin's cabinet members have also been threatened and have been given
extra bodyguards and armoured cars.
Intelligence expert Yossi Melman said security had been ''a total
failure because the handwriting has been on the wall for the past
month''. -- AP

TWO British disc jockeys were given suspended prison sentences, fined,
and ordered to leave Thailand today after admitting possessing
pornography.
Clifford James Armstrong, 34, a former orderly in the Royal Army
Medical Corps from London, and Ian David Baker, 44, from Manchester,
were each given three-month suspended sentences, a year's probation, and
fined #70 each.
A spokesman for Bangkok's Smile Radio confirmed that 20 other English
speaking staff would remain suspended from the radio station and would
have to find or be found jobs elsewhere.
The Thai authorities insist that the radio station no longer broadcast
in English, he said.
The accused were suspended last month after a disaffected member of
staff claimed that the station phones were being used to set up dates
with boys.
No evidence was found to suggest that they broadcast a sex-contact
number. However police found pornographic material at their homes last
month.

A TEARFUL eulogy by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's 18-year-old
granddaughter Noa Ben-Artzi Philosof pulled heartstrings around the
world. Here is what she said at his funeral:
''Forgive me if I do not want to talk about peace. I want to talk
about my grandfather. You always awake from a nightmare but since
yesterday I only awake into a nightmare -- the nightmare of life without
you and that is impossible to fathom.
''The television does not stop broadcasting your pictures and you are
so alive and real that I can almost touch you, but only just, because I
can't anymore.
''Grandfather, you were the pillar of fire in front of the camp and
now we are just a camp left alone in the dark and we are so cold and
sad.
''I know they are speaking in terms of a national disaster. But how
can you try to console an entire nation or let it share in your private
pain when grandmother cannot stop crying and we are mute, feeling the
vast emptiness now that you are gone?
''Few really knew you. They can say many things about you but I feel
they do not know at all the enormous extent of the pain and tragedy.
''And yes, this is a holocaust -- at least for us, the family and
friends -- because we are left without a pillar of fire.
''Grandfather, you were and still are our hero. I wanted you to know
that in everything I've done in life, I saw you before my eyes.
''Your esteem and love were with us in every step we took and along
every road we walked. We live in the light of your values, always.
''You never abandoned us and now you have been abandoned. And now here
you are, my eternal hero, cold and alone and I can do nothing to save
you. You are so wonderful.
''Great men have already eulogised you but no-one has felt, like I
have, the caress of your warm and soft hands, or your warm embrace which
was reserved for us alone and your half-smile which always told me so
much. That same smile, is no longer and froze with you.
''I harbour no feelings of revenge because the pain and my loss are so
great -- too great. The earth crumbled under our feet and somehow we are
trying to sit in the empty space that is left -- but with little
success.
''I cannot finish but apparently a strange hand, a miserable hand has
already finished for me.
''Given no choice, I part with you, my hero, and ask you to rest in
peace and think of us and miss us because here down below we love you so
much.
''Angels in heaven who are with you now, I ask you to protect him, and
protect him well because you are deserving of this protection.
''We love you, grandfather, forever.''

Tbilisi
FORMER Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, savouring his
sweeping victory in Georgia's presidential election, said today he had
won backing for a programme for ''saving the country''.
Early official results gave Shevardnadze 70% of the vote compared with
17% for his closest rival, his former protege Dzhumber Patiashvili.
''I am happy that the Georgian people have accepted my programme,''
Shevardnadze said in a radio interview.
''I think that this confidence referendum has been won and a big
majority of the population has accepted my programme of saving the
country.''
Shevardnadze later flew to Israel for the funeral of assassinated
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, with whom he had close contacts as Soviet
Foreign Minister until he resigned in 1990.
He received a further boost when the Central Electoral Commission said
his centre-party Citizen's Union was well ahead in the parliamentary
race with about 90% of the votes counted.
That would mean Shevardnadze could continue his radical economic
reforms and maintain good relations with Russia, which have been opposed
by right-wing parties.
Shevardnadze, 67, who has been Georgia's leader since 1992 without
having the title of president, needed a simple majority to win the
presidential election outright in the first round.
''Such support is great. This is our common victory, it is Georgia's
victory,'' said Shevardnadze, who in August survived an assassination
attempt when a bomb went off near his motorcade.--Reuter.

Singapore
A BRITISH fugitive urged a court to convict him of manslaughter
instead of murder -- which carries the death penalty -- saying he killed
a South African tourist accidentally.
However John Martin Scripps' lawyer offered no explanation of why the
body of the victim, Gerard Lowe, was found chopped into pieces.
The trial has exposed a suspected international trail of crimes by
Scripps, a self-confessed drug runner who has spent most of his adult
life in British prisons.
He was serving 13 years for a drugs offence when he fled British
custody during weekend parole in October 1994. A manslaughter conviction
would put him in prison for life.
The ''killing occurred in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a
sudden quarrel'', defence lawyer Edmond Pereira told the High Court.
''We urge the court to (conclude) that the accused is not guilty of
murder but guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder,'' he
said in his closing submission.
In her final statement, prosecutor Jennifer Marie rejected that
version, saying the killing was an ''intentional and conscious'' act.
Scripps is also wanted in Thailand for the murders of Sheila Damude,
49, a Canadian teacher, and her 23-year-old son, Darin, whose
dismembered bodies were found in the resort town of Phuket.
Scripps befriended Lowe, a Johannesburg engineer, at Singapore airport
on March 8 and the two shared a hotel room.
The prosecution says Scripps, who worked as a butcher in prison,
dismembered Lowe, dumped the body parts in a river, and used Lowe's
credit cards for a shopping spree and to withdraw money from a bank.
Scripps, 35, denies dismembering Lowe. He says he hit out with a
hammer after Lowe made a homosexual pass. Then, he says, he panicked,
fled the hotel, and sought an unnamed British friend staying in another
hotel. The friend disposed of the body, Scripps claimed.
Doubts have been raised about this story because Scripps refuses to
name the friend, saying he was a dangerous drug dealer who would harm
his family.
The prosecution said Scripps was ''a man who has no qualms in lying
continuously, consistently, even on the witness stand, on any and every
matter''.
Pereira, however, argued that even if Scripps was lying about the
existence of the British friend, this was irrelevant to the charge of
murder.
''The involvement of the British friend is confined to the disposal of
the body. It does not change the evidence of what happened in the
(hotel) room on March 8,'' he said.
Scripps flew from Singapore to Thailand on March 11 and the next day
met the Canadian couple in Phuket, where they shared a taxi from the
airport to a hotel. Scripps was found to be carrying their belongings
when he was arrested on March 19 on returning to Singapore.
Scripps has also been linked to the murder of a British holidaymaker
in Cancun, Mexico.
The trial continues today.--AP.

'You were the pillar of fire in front of the camp and now we are just
a camp left alone in the dark and we are so cold and sad . . . we are
mute, feeling the vast emptiness now that you are gone'.
DEPUTY Prime Minister Michael Heseltine yesterday led tributes in the
Commons to assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
MPs on all sides saluted his courage as a soldier and as a politician,
and said the peace process to which he was committed must continue.
The Prime Minister, Labour leader Tony Blair, and Liberal Democrat
leader Paddy Ashdown all were attending Mr Rabin's funeral yesterday.
Mr Heseltine told MPs: ''As Mr Major said yesterday, no one has done
more for peace in the Middle East.''
Mr Heseltine said that under Mr Rabin's leadership, Israel had taken a
''historic'' decision to embark on its land-for-peace policy and cease
rule over the Palestinian people.
''This was a difficult decision but a right and a brave one.''
He added that Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was touring the Middle
East this week to reaffirm Britain's support for the peace process and
encourage those countries to do the same.
Labour deputy leader John Prescott said: ''Yitzhak Rabin was a brave
soldier, an outstanding leader, and a great statesman. He paid the
ultimate price.''
Tory former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath said he had known Mr Rabin
as a soldier in the Six Day War and then as Prime Minister.
''One admired his integrity and his straightforwardness. One always
knew one could trust him in what he said.''
Former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said his concern had been for
Israel's safety, not his own: ''For a democratic politician in that kind
of position, the risks are very great. He deliberately ran those risks.
For such men, there is no such thing as total security.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Alex Carlile said Mr Rabin had combined
''physical heroism, moral courage, and excellent intellectual
judgment''.
In the Lords, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, told
peers that the shooting of Mr Rabin was a ''reminder how demonic
religion can become when it is perverted by hatred and fundamentalism''.
''We are not ashamed, we are not afraid, nor are we anything but
determined to fulfil the legacy for which my friend fell as did my
grandfather in this very city when I was with him and but a young boy.''
King Hussein of Jordan
''Look at the leaders from all over the Middle East and around the
world who have journeyed here today for Yitzhak Rabin and for peace.
Though we no longer hear his deep and booming voice, it is he who has
brought us together again here in word and deed for peace.''
President Bill Clinton
''His earnest efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East are a
testament to his vision which we share to end the suffering of all the
peoples of our region.''

NAHA: Tension was high on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa
yesterday on the eve of the trial of three US servicemen accused of a
raping a 12-year-old girl. The furore over the case has raised questions
about the future of American military bases in Japan, and overshadowed
this month's summit between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama.

THE Princess of Wales endured a stylised nightmare yesterday when she
found herself sharing a stage with another blonde in a distinctly
lookalike outfit.
Former TV news reader Angela Rippon faced the princess in front of
more than 600 guests in the Hilton Hotel ballroom in London's Park Lane.
They were there for an awards ceremony organised by the charity Help
the Aged, of which the princess is patron.
Miss Rippon, who was hosting the ceremony in honour of retirees who
serve the community, began by publicly accepting what everyone else had
already noticed.
''As you can see, blue is the colour of the day here,'' she said, to
general laughter.
At the other side of the flower-bedecked stage, the princess smiled.
She was wearing a powder-blue coat-dress, with matching high-heeled
shoes.
Miss Rippon wore a thigh-length jacket of similar hue but her brown
skirt and shoes were hidden behind the rostrum.
Both outfits had three large gold buttons on each sleeve, with six
similar buttons down the front.
After leaving the stage, the pair posed for an official photograph
with the award winners and presenters.
Miss Rippon tactfully seated herself well away from the princess.
After the princess had left, Miss Rippon said their similar choice in
outfits had not been mentioned.
''She didn't mention it at all, but I'm sure she was amused by it,''
Said Miss Rippon. ''After all, great minds think alike.''
She had bought the jacket in the south of France at the beginning of
the year, she said. It was made by the Paris-based fashion firm Electre.
Asked if she thought the princess's outfit could have been made by the
same firm, she said: ''I don't know, I haven't seen one like the
princess is wearing.
''But I expect hers cost a great deal more than mine.''

THE boyfriend of Julia Somerville, the ITN newsreader at the centre of
allegations over pictures of her naked seven-year-old daughter, often
used a whole roll of film on one subject, his business partner insisted
yesterday.
Mr Jeremy Dixon, 56, and 48-year-old Miss Somerville were arrested
last week after a Boots photo-lab technician, Mr Sheldon Atkinson,
reported the bathtime snaps to police.
Mr Atkinson told the Sun newspaper that the entire roll of film which
Mr Dixon took to be developed contained naked shots of the girl.
However, Mr Dixon's partner in his central London architects'
practice, Mr Edward Jones, spoke out in defence of his old college
friend who he has known for 40 years.
''I know him as well as anyone and from that knowledge I know him to
be a person of great integrity, a very generous person and a rather
moral person,'' he said.
''This whole thing is outrageous and can only be a terrible mistake.''
Mr Jones's comments came shortly after Miss Somerville returned to
work in a chauffeur-driven limousine at ITN headquarters in central
London to present the lunchtime bulletin.
The mother-of-two smiled for photographers awaiting her arrival but
refused to comment about the pictures.
Earlier it emerged that Mr Atkinson had been suspended on full pay by
Boots, pending an investigation over his newspaper comments.
Mr Jones said Mr Dixon often carried his camera with him and would
think nothing of shooting a whole roll of film ''very quickly and very
professionally'' on a single subject.
''He does not mix his subjects, even if it's a subject which requires
only four or five photos.
''In our office we have got boxes and boxes of photographs and many of
them are of the same subject.''
Mr Jones added: ''I cannot over-stress the point that Jeremy has great
integrity and moral standing and he is a great family person.
''He has three children of his own -- two daughters and a son -- and
he is devoted to Julia's children.''
He confirmed that Miss Somerville had asked Mr Dixon to take the
pictures.
A Boots spokeswoman said Mr Atkinson, 24, would not be working at any
of the chain's branches until the investigation was completed.
Although he worked for Boots as a film developer, he is an employee of
Kodak, which will conduct the inquiry.
* Britain's leading child protection charity yesterday backed photo
labs which monitor pictures of children. The National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children said it was right that workers should
call in police if they were worried.
A spokeswoman said: ''It is better to take a risk and to be wrong than
not to and leave a child to suffer years of abuse.''

<HEADLINE>Healthy foetus dies through label mix-up. Hospital sued over abortion mistakes</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975503607</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO women are suing a hospital where doctors aborted a healthy foetus
after a mix-up, it emerged yesterday.
One of the women was the mother of a healthy child whose life was
terminated because of a mix-up over labels.
The other woman, Ms Michelle Woods, had been told she was carrying a
healthy boy when in fact her baby was a Down's Syndrome girl.
She also had an abortion.
The incidents happened at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, which has
accepted it was a case of human error.
A letter of apology has been sent to both women and extra checks have
been introduced to prevent the mistake happening again.
Mr Chris Coe, head of communications at Addenbrooke's, said yesterday:
''I believe legal action is being taken by both women.''
It is understood the action is likely to be settled out of court.
The mix-up occurred in a laboratory, when two test samples were
labelled wrongly.
It was a simple error but one which had dreadful consequences for the
families involved.
The woman whose healthy foetus was aborted has not been identified.
Two inquiries were held into the tragedy in September. One was an
internal investigation and the other an external one by a doctor in
charge of a similar laboratory at another hospital.
Both decided there were no flaws in laboratory procedure at
Addenbrooke's and blamed human error.
Mr Coe said: ''Nothing like this has ever happened before. The staff
have been spoken to and they are devastated.''
Professor Martin Bobrow, clinical director of medical genetics at
Addenbrooke's, said: ''We have offered an unqualified apology to these
two families. My staff are devastated that such a mistake, which has
never happened here before, could have occurred.''
A statement from Addenbrooke's NHS Trust said the error was discovered
on September 4.
Both women were patients at West Suffolk Hospital in August when their
samples were sent to the regional genetics laboratory at Addenbrooke's
to be tested for Down's Syndrome.
The statement added: ''An error in labelling samples led to one of
these patients being incorrectly informed that her baby had Down's
Syndrome, and she subsequently terminated her pregnancy.
''The other patient was wrongly informed that her baby was healthy and
was told of the mistake by her consultant while still in the early days
of pregnancy, and therefore able to make choices about her unborn baby's
future.''
Routine tests on the aborted foetus of the healthy baby confirmed that
it did not have Down's Syndrome.
''A subsequent internal inquiry revealed that the two patients'
samples had interchanged labels and human error was found to be the
cause of this mistake,'' said the statement.
The external inquiry found ''there were not flaws in the laboratory's
protocols that contributed to the error''.
However, procedures in the laboratory had been tightened. Mr Coe said
this involved the introduction of extra checks.
Because of the number of people working in the laboratory and the
large number of samples they dealt with, it was impossible to say who
was individually responsible for the mistake, Mr Coe said.
Ms Woods, 28, and partner Russell Barnard, 44, from Thetford, Norfolk,
had been looking forward to the birth of their first child. Ms Woods has
three children from an earlier marriage.
She is quoted as saying: ''I feel sorry for the other lady because she
suffered much more. If she hadn't had the termination, she would have
had a perfect baby.''

<TEXT>
A BUSINESSMAN who backed a campaign against a sauna which was
allegedly going to be used as a brothel has been jailed for three months
for threatening a woman at knifepoint and demanding sex.
Michael Anthony forced the 43-year-old woman to take off her pyjamas
before she was able to call for help from her daughter, Edinburgh
Sheriff Court heard.
The woman said she was able to call the police when Anthony tried to
stop her daughter going to a neighbour for help.
Sheriff Annella Cowan had earlier found Anthony, 42, of Allanfield,
Edinburgh, guilty of assaulting the woman at a house in Edinburgh on May
20, brandishing a knife, threatening to kill her, demanding sex, and
cutting her on the thumb with the knife.
She told Anthony that prison was the only appropriate sentence.
''I found you guilty of a violent and terrifying attack on a woman in
the safety of her own home,'' said Sheriff Cowan.
Anthony, an unemployed business consultant, had denied the charge and
claimed he was acting in self defence.
After the case, he claimed he had been set up by the woman because of
his involvement with Ms Debra Scanlan's successful legal battle against
Edinburgh District Council over its licensing of a sauna which, she
claimed, would be used as a brothel.
However, Sheriff Annella Cowan described the woman as a ''credible and
reliable'' witness and added that there was sufficient evidence, which
she believed, to back her up.
Depute-fiscal Neil Allan told the sheriff in his summing up that
Anthony was a ''deviously manipulative man who has not told the truth in
his evidence''.
Solicitor Mark Harrower, however, pointed out that Sheriff Cowan had
been asked to believe that ''a family man who is a businessman, who has
no history of this sort of behaviour simply went wild with a knife one
evening''.
Anthony had never been in trouble before and the incident was a one
off, said Mr Harrower.

SINCE being privatised five years ago, the water industry south of the
Border has cut capital investment by over #250m while profits have risen
by three times that amount.
This damning claim comes from a Labour Party report which shows water
companies have cut capital investment by #282m while profits have risen
by #755m since privatisation.
Launching the report yesterday, Shadow Environment Secretary Frank
Dobson said it proved water companies could not be trusted to invest
sufficiently in their infrastructure. Mr Dobson called for the
introduction of mandatory targets to force them to act to prevent the
millions of gallons lost daily through leaking pipework.
After Labour drew attention to the widespread leakage last August, the
industry undertook ''the biggest programme of leakage reduction in
history'' but gave no further details, said Mr Dobson.
The water companies had cut their capital investment every year but
one since privatisation and Labour claims that in 1994-95 the water
industry spent less on capital investment than at any time since
privatisation.

NEW legislation which denies direct access to the Court of Criminal
Appeal in Scotland may increase the risk of miscarriages of justice, the
Faculty of Advocates warned yesterday.
The faculty's criminal law group also thinks that the provisions of
the 1995 Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act which introduce a sifting
process to weed out ''hopeless' appeals may be in breach of the European
Convention on Human Rights.
The faculty has issued guidance on the new appeal process to every
firm of solicitors in Scotland with the aim of minimising the risk that
good appeals will be thrown out during the behind-the-scenes sifting
process.
At the moment, all appeals ranging from the most trivial breach of the
peace to murder are heard in open court by three judges.
The Government has introduced a weeding-out process to be conducted by
a judge in private with the aim of reducing the ever-increasing caseload
of the bench.
According to one estimate, over the past five years the workload of
the Supreme Court has increased at the rate of 8% a year. About 3000
cases a year are marked for appeal but up to 40% of these are abandoned,
many not until the day of the hearing, by which time the judges have
already spent a considerable amount of time studying the appeal papers.
Under the new system, which was introduced at the end of September,
grounds of appeal are lodged as before but are now inspected by a single
judge along with documents such as the report of the trial judge and a
transcript of his charge to the jury.
The judge grants leave to appeal if he thinks the papers disclose a
stateable ground of appeal. Where leave is refused, there is an appeal
to two or three judges by way of a letter from the appellant or his
solicitor.
The faculty does not oppose the weeding-out process in principle but
is concerned that it all takes place in chambers outwith the presence of
the parties involved and there is no provision for verbal argument to be
presented to the judge.
At a news conference in Edinburgh yesterday, Mr Andrew Hardie QC, Dean
of the Faculty of Advocates, said: ''We are anxious to draw to the
attention of the public and the profession at large that there is a risk
in these new provisions of substantial miscarriages of justice.
''The reason for that concern is that the provisions have removed the
right to appear. The provisions relating to sifting do not enable an
appellant to be represented and make submissions to the court.
Miss Leeona Dorrian QC, convener of the advocates criminal law group,
explained: ''The only document which may be put before the judges is
that containing the original grounds of appeal. If that is flawed or
poorly presented, a stateable appeal may be refused and an inappropriate
conviction or sentence may stand by default.
''Responsibility for initiating an application for leave to appeal
lies with the appellant's solicitors. It is their duty to ensure that
the grounds of appeal and application letter are as detailed as possible
and skilfully drafted, since these are the only means through which any
degree of argument can be advanced.''
Miss Dorrian added that in a system which relied entirely on written
submissions, it was essential that these should be of the highest
possible standard in the interests of justice.
''Our hope is that by issuing this document throughout Scotland it
will have done something to prevent the risk of a good appeal failing to
pass the sifting process,'' she said.
In the paper issued to solicitors, the criminal law group says it is
difficult to assess how strictly the judges will interpret the
''arguable grounds'' test.
''On the one hand, the Lord Advocate in debates in the House of Lords
indicated that the purpose was simply to weed out ''frivolous'' appeals,
appeals clearly without merit.
''On the other hand, the suspicion remains that the purpose behind the
legislation is time-saving and cost-cutting, whereby the number of
appeals on the court roll is signficantly reduced.''

THE Crown Office yesterday presented an upbeat view of the
procurator-fiscal service, insisting that new procedures should cut down
on unnecessary work and delays.
Publication of its annual report follows the fiasco at Falkirk last
week. Thirteen cases collapsed at district court because of lack of a
prosecutor owing to severe pressure on a service also having to cope
with extensive High Court work.
''In 1994/95, our staff numbers continued to fall, reflecting the
benefits of the introduction of new technology and the need to maintain
tight control of running costs,'' the report says.
Actual spending on the service fell last year from #43.6m to #41.5m,
largely due to a fall in capital expenditure and administrative costs.
Workload, excluding minor road traffic offences, remained virtually the
same, processing an average of 5400 reports every week.
The report draws comfort from the advent of the Criminal Procedure
(Scotland) Act.
''Our ability to work effectively continues to be hampered by the late
stage at which cases are concluded.
''For a long time, we have been of the view that many of the cases
which are dealt with by a plea of guilty could be disposed of earlier
than they are, if suitable procedures could be put in place to encourage
earlier resolution without placing undue pressure on accused persons.''
''We believe that some of the new provisions will help to create such
a climate,'' the report says.
It points to the increasing role within the new Act for intermediate
diets, where numbers of guilty pleas have doubled in each of the last
two years, and the rise in 1994 in the number of sheriff court cases
disposed of at first calling.
''There may therefore be some room for cautious optimism,'' the report
adds.

STRATHCLYDE region was accused yesterday of leaving Scots textile
workers in the cold after it emerged that 500 official council scarves,
a number of which are tartan, bear the label ''made in Germany''.
The items, which are given to female councillors to wear when
representing the region and offered to overseas visitors as souvenirs,
will be the subject of a protest against the Labour administration by
SNP members tomorrow.
Bearing the official council logo and in a variety of colours
including the Black Watch tartan, the scarves were bought on tender from
the Glasgow-based firm The Trophy Shop and cost the region #3.85 each.
Ms Kim Nicoll, SNP member for Irvine Valley, said: ''I could hardly
believe my eyes when I saw the label. So much for Labour's commitment to
the Scottish workforce.
''Part of the point of merchandising is to promote your area but how
can Strathclyde be seen to have a clear brand message with tartan which
is 'made in Germany'.
''Is the administration really saying that they couldn't find a
Scottish company to produce the scarves?''
Made in Scotland, the marketing arm of the Scottish craft and giftware
industry, said it was ''surprised'' by the council's decision.
A spokesman added: ''We have a database of more than 500 Scottish
companies and would encourage everyone placing such orders to approach
us so we can give them suppliers' prices.
''We are confident that within these companies there would have been
one at least who could have supplied the council.''
However, a council spokeswoman said: ''We are bound by EU requirements
to offer such contracts to European tender.
''Wherever possible, the council does try to buy Scottish but in this
case the most competitive price came from Germany. We have to attempt to
offer local taxpayers the best value for money.''
Speaking on behalf of the Trophy Shop, Mr Gerry McAleer said: ''We
were simply asked to supply a number of scarves. There was no
stipulation as to where they should be made.''

A PROPOSED agreement between European employers and trades unions
would give working parents the right to 12 weeks unpaid parental leave
but not in the UK because of the Government's opt-out from the social
provisions of the Maastricht treaty.
The TUC, however, last night described the ground- breaking agreement
as ''a milestone in the development of social partnership in Europe''
and said it would challenge UK employers to opt-in on parental leave,
something for which the TUC had campaigned for many years.
The proposed deal, which has still to be ratified, is the first time
that employers and unions have used the provision in the EU Maastricht
Treaty that allows the social partners to negotiate new Europe-wide
social protection measures, which are then automatically implemented by
the EU.
TUC general secretary John Monks said the agreement showed that
employers and unions throughout Europe could sit down and work out
sensible arrangements on a social partnership basis.
''Unfortunately, Britain's parents will not automatically get these
new legal rights but trade unions will now start to negotiate with
employers with the aim of securing them in this country.''
The first targets would be companies which that operate across Europe,
many of whom had already ignored the UK opt-out by including British
employees in their works councils.

LABOUR'S new parliamentary social security team has been ordered by Mr
Tony Blair to prepare, over the next year, a series of radical proposals
to overhaul the welfare state, as part of his rolling project to reform
every aspect of party policy.
Mr Chris Smith, the new Shadow Social Security Secretary, will seek to
take further the recommendations of the Commission on Social Justice set
up by the late leader John Smith, which Mr Blair considers are not
radical enough.
He wants new proposals in advance of the General Election to help
present Labour as more adventurous on welfare reform than the
Conservatives. He has asked Mr Smith to ''think the unthinkable'' in an
attempt to develop a co-ordinated policy.
Last night a Labour source claimed Mr Blair has long made clear his
intentions of reforming social welfare policy. ''There is nothing new to
this. He's always said that he sees radical reform of the welfare state
as part of the project. The Social Justice Commission was not endorsed
when it came out, it was never Labour party policy.''
The Commission, established in 1992 by John Smith, published its
report last year, shortly after Mr Blair was elected leader. He
responded to its proposals by promising to examine them and select those
he thought appropriate. But he is said to be fundamentally disatisfied
with its attempt to reinterpret the welfare state.
Mr Smith took over his post last month in the Shadow Cabinet
reshuffle, following the appointment of Mr Donald Dewar as Chief Whip.
He and his team will begin a round of meetings with academics to look
at possible reforms, including ways of targeting child benefoit more
effectively, welfare-to-work schemes for single parents, and ways of
integrating the tax and benefit systems.

WITH MPs under pressure these days to declare anything and everything
since Nolan, Mr Michael Heseltine only narrowly escaped the indignity of
being asked how much he forks out to what Mr Dennis Skinner called ''his
personal hairdresser''.
The Bolsover battler made the reasonable point that, although charged
with cutting Government red tape and slimming down the Whitehall
machine, Hezza has actually started up another Government department --
his own.
Mr Skinner poured scorn on Hezza's #150,000 desk diary, before
becoming really personal and dragging in the man's barber.
Clearly, tending the Heseltine mane is a challenging task and the man
who does it deserves our admiration for his contribution to one of
Britain's most famous profiles.
However, barbering is one of the things Labour never nationalised and
perhaps even Mr Skinner's revolutionary fervour does not extend to
creating state barber shops with no choice about who is going to trim
your locks.
Also, a spokesman later made clear that Mr Heseltine pays his
hairdresser out of his own pocket.
The Deputy Prime Minister's department has three other Ministers as
well, which seems a lot for one devoted to cutting the impact of
Government on business.
Labour, however, has rather forfeited the right to cast the first
stone by providing four Front Benchers to shadow them -- if ''shadow''
can rightly be used to describe the substantial Mr John Prescott.
Mr Tony Banks (Newham North-West -- Lab.), usually a stinging gadfly
of a questioner, obsequiously informed Mr Heseltine that he was doing a
really excellent job and after a few further compliments told him ''to
have a nice day.''
Fears that Mr Banks might be about to head across the floor in the
reverse direction to Mr Alan Howarth were checked as he revealed that he
is anxious for the Millennium Commission, of which Mr Heseltine is a
member, to site a new building amidst the other architectural glories of
Newham and felt that a bit of public crawling was a price worth paying.
An indication that perhaps the Heseltine team feel that deregulation
and competition -- important though they undoubtedly are -- do not
provide a full week's work for four grown Ministers, came when Mr Dale
Campbell-Savours (Workington -- Lab.) complained that Mr Heseltine has
taken to answering parliamentary questions on matters which are outside
his departmental remit.
The Deputy Prime Minister had taken on himself to reply to questions
on the European Union budget, social democracy, and other matters all of
which sounded a bit more interesting than deregulation, competition, the
civil service and market testing, which is what his department is
responsible for.
It could be that, as Number Two in a Conservative Government, he feels
the current findings of political market testing so depressing that he
is turning to things like the EU budget and social democracy as light
relief.
Mr Campbell-Savours, who would have made a splendid Roundhead preacher
denouncing the follies and vanities of Cavaliers like Sir Hezza and his
sleek deputy Master Roger Freeman, pointed out witheringly that, so keen
had the DPM been to widen his horizons that his answers frequently bore
''little relation to the questions actually tabled.''
The Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd, conceded that there was ''some
concern about this matter''. I'll say. Ministers answering questions
they haven't even been asked amounts to a revolution in the style of
Government which puts Nolan in the shade.

SOCIAL Security Secretary Peter Lilley yesterday announced eight
areas,including parts of Scotland, which will benefit from a #75m pilot
project to top up low earnings.
Mr Lilley told the Commons at Question Time that the Earnings Top-Up
Scheme would ''make work more worthwhile for unemployed people without
dependent children and with limited earning power''.
The pilot scheme will run for three years from October 1996.
The initiative is aimed at complementing Family Credit by giving
people on low incomes the incentive to stay in work rather than leave
work and rely on benefits.
About 20,000 are expected to gain extra money under the pilot scheme
with a possible 500,000 set to get extra cash when the scheme goes
nationwide, a spokesman for the Department of Social Security said.
Mr Lilley said in a Commons written reply that people in four areas
would be paid at a higher rate and four areas at a lower rate.
The higher rate will apply in Central Scotland (Perth, Crieff,
Dumbarton and Stirling), Sunderland, Doncaster and Bournemouth. This is
estimated to work out at #18 a week for single people under 25 and #25
for couples.
Those eligible for the extra cash in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, parts of
Yorkshire (Castleford, Pontefract, Wakefield, Dewsbury and Barnsley),
Southend, and north Wales (Bangor and Caernarfon, Conway and Colwyn,
Denbigh, Dolgellau and Barmouth, Holyhead, Shotton, Flint and Rhyll, and
Wrexham) will be paid a lower rate.

WORK to build the British Gas pipeline in the Northern Channel of the
Irish Sea was completed last Friday, the Department of Trade and
Industry confirmed last night, but gas will not begin to flow until late
next year, to allow for safety tests.
Ayrshire MPs yesterday met Energy Minister Tim Eggar, who told them
the Health and Safety Executive will have to certify the work before it
can become operational.
News that the pipeline has been finished surprised the MPs, who had
planned to demand that work be suspended.
They claimed that the excavation of the seabed had disturbed a
deep-sea munitions dump in Beaufort's Dyke, a 263- fathom trench between
Galloway and Northern Ireland, sending flares and incendiary devices to
the surface and on to nearby Scottish and Irish beaches.
Last month, the Scottish Office agreed to commission an emergency
survey of the arms dump ''to allay public fears'' in response to a
public outcry over allegations that British Gas's work had disturbed the
wartime munitions.
Mr Eggar told the MPs that the HSE had imposed a prohibition order
suspending the work from October 13 to October 16 to investigate claims.
However, he insisted that objects in a photograph published in a
newspaper which were claimed to be depth charges had been identified by
Glasgow University experts as an oil drum and a hot water boiler.
The MPs emerged from the meeting unhappy at not having been told
earlier that the work had been completed, but expressed satisfaction
that Mr Eggar had agreed to look at ways of improving communications
between MPs and the four Government departments who had jurisdiction in
the affair.
Mr Brian Donohoe, Labour MP for Cunninghame South, said: ''As far as
I'm concerned, today demonstrates that we have been given the runaround.
We will not in the future allow ourselves to find that at a meeting we
are told that the exercise is all over.''
Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley,
said: ''We collectively are still anxious about the position and will be
until the survey is completed. We will remain vigilant on the whole
issue.''
A spokeswoman for the DTI said British Gas would carry out its own
survey of the work, in addition to the one to be carried out for the
Scottish office. There was no proof that the emergence of munitions on
the beaches could be linked to the pipeline, she said.

THE resolution of the state spending argument in Cabinet has played
out well for the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, whose Divorce Reform
Bill, backed by all the churches south of the Border, now will appear in
the Queen's Speech for legislation in what might be the last session of
this Parliament before a General Election.
Last week, the Bill was in doubt because Government spokesmen were
saying that there might not be parliamentary time for it if the
Chancellor's Budget statement on taxation and spending required
additional Bills.
Weekend deals done between the Treasury and spending Ministers like Mr
Forsyth, Education Secretary Gillian Shephard, Social Security Secretary
Peter Lilley, and Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell, appear to have
settled the problem of parliamentary time for legislation.
Lord Mackay's Divorce Reform Bill is still to be drafted but it is now
certain to be given the time required next year.
Some Tory right-wingers object to proposals to introduce ''no fault''
divorces and to reduce the maximum waiting period for divorce from five
years to one.
Mr Roger Gale (Thanet North), who was vociferous in his opposition to
the now shelved Family Home and Domestic Violence Bill, said: ''I would
be concerned if we were to enact legislation to make it easier to break
up a marriage but from I have seen this actually makes it harder in some
ways.''
The decision to press ahead with the Bill was welcomed as a way of
slowing down divorce procedure by the former director of Relate, David
French.
''This is excellent news for anyone who believes in marriage or
understands the pain that divorce inflicts,'' he said.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth appears to have rescued Scotland
from the full impact of state spending cuts agreed over the weekend by
Cabinet Ministers. His #14.5bn budget will be reduced, but by not as
much as the Treasury was demanding. .
The precise implications for the Scottish budget are still unclear,
but what is certain is that Mr Forsyth has staved off the worst impact
of what may amount to be #5000m cuts throughout Whitehall.
He has fought successfully to resist the altering of the highly
complicated ''Barnett/Goschen formula,'' by which Scottish spending
totals are calculated.
Scottish Offices sources indicated yesterday that the Prime Minister
had backed Mr Forsyth's defence of the existing system against efforts
by Treasury Secretary William Waldegrave to change the formula.
Not only would the overall Scottish Office budget be cut by no more
than corresponding cuts in the south, Mr Forsyth would continue to have
full control over how to share out that cake, it was claimed.
However, with education and health expected to be spared the cuts both
north and south of the Border, the pattern is likely to look so similar
that critics will say the Scottish Secretary has had his traditional
right to set spending patterns eroded.
The death of the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, brought about
a dramatic round of ministerial telephone calls over the weekend because
the matter had to be settled before the Prime Minister left for
Jerusalem.
Last Thursday's Cabinet gave the Scottish Secretary and his Welsh
colleague, William Hague, a bad time. A special Cabinet meeting was
scheduled for yesterday to resolve the difficulties but Mr Rabin's
assassination pre-empted this.
Over the weekend, Mr Forsyth was on the phone to Mr Waldegrave.
However, Mr Forsyth had still not got a deal until the Prime Minister
came to his aid on Saturday night.
The Barnett/Goschen formula, whereby Scotland has received 10.66% of
state spending increases, always has implied that when public
expenditure cuts are being made Scotland should bear a similar
percentage.
Despite the fact that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke told The Herald
recently that this formula would survive, the Treasury has been bearing
down on Mr Forsyth very severely in its search for spending cuts to give
credibility to tax cuts.
Last Thursday's Cabinet was bleak for the Scottish Secretary, and his
position might have remained the same had the special spending Cabinet
scheduled for yesterday gone ahead.
However, the Israeli Premier's assassination intervened and the Prime
Minister and his Chancellor were in a hurry to get the issue settled.
By the time that Mr Forsyth went to the Prime Minister's lunch at
Chequers on Sunday, along with all the others who supported Mr Major in
his leadership election last summer, the issue was settled.
Mr Major is backing Mr Forsyth as far as he can, as part of his
passionate defence of the Union against the devolution arguments.
Last night Cabinet colleagues were reporting that Mr Forsyth has done
''rather well''.
The Scottish Secretary appears to have called in all his influence on
Mr Major to get a budget settlement that he can sell to Scotland as a
good deal when the Government is in the process of radical expenditure
cuts.
His Cabinet colleagues last night were reporting that he has managed
this by arguing successfully not only on the economic realities of
Scotland but also the political realities of the Tory case against a
Scottish parliament with which the Prime Minister passionately agrees.
Mr Forsyth's opponents played down his apparent success in winning the
Prime Minister's backing for the existing formula. Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson said: .''The so-called battle for Barnett has
been nothing more than a phoney war designed to make Michael Forsyth
look like the saviour of Scotland,''
''Even Kenneth Clarke himself in The Herald last month made it clear
that there was never any question of reducing Scottish spending to
English levels. The real test for Michael Forsyth isn't whether Barnett
stays but whether he can protect Scotland against cuts in real terms in
Scottish spending.''
This was echoed by SNP Treasury spokesman John Swinney, who said that
since the then Treasury Secretary Michael Portillo cut the formula to a
pro-rata population share of any spending increases the new threat had
''a false ring.''
''It seems also to be the case the Forsyth has effectively lost his
ability to exercise discretion in allocating the Scottish block. It is
Scotland that will lose out because of Forsyth's antics.''
The Chancellor wants #3bn cut from a total spend of #263bn to give him
scope for tax cuts. If, as indicated yesterday, that is applied to
Scotland evenly, it would mean a cut in the Scottish block of #14.5bn of
some #281m.
With health and education spending expected to be spared cuts, and
with Mr Forsyth committing himself to more policemen on the beat, other
areas of spending such as transport and local authority services will
bear the brunt.
The president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities,
Rosemary McKenna, called it a ''black day for local government and a
black day for the people.''
She pointed out that efficiency savings were being demanded in
addition to supposed reorganisation savings of #30m. With some areas
ring-fenced, others would suffer. ''It is very worrying,'' she said.
''Housing, vital social work services and all non-statutory services
such as nurseries will be affected.

A SIGNAL that the Government plans a tougher line on the reporting of
pupil exclusions from school was given yesterday by Mr Raymond
Robertson, the Scottish Office Minister for Education.
He announced that next month's school-by-school tables of attendance
and absence rates will for the first time give separate figures on
exclusions.
The extra statistics were necessary because the debate about
classifying exclusions needed facts and figures, he told delegates
attending the launch of the Scottish initiative on attendance and
absence.
Authorities such as Lothian region classify temporary pupil exclusions
as authorised, or explained, absences.
However, the Minister said, based on Scottish law, an excluded child
was normally judged to have failed to attend school without reasonable
excuse.
''It is therefore logical and consistent to categorise temporary
exclusions as unauthorised,'' he said.
Some authorities and schools are concerned about the classification
putting them in a bad light.
However, Mr Robertson warned that action could be taken to standardise
classification across the country.
The information on temporary exclusions will be presented in the
number of pupil half-days lost throughout Scotland.
The authorities which are responsible for educating the majority of
Scottish pupils do not operate a policy of permanent exclusions from
school.
Research is under way into all aspects of exclusions policies,
including finding alternatives.
Mr Robertson said truancy was a problem which the Government would not
sweep under the carpet. ''It is plain common sense that there are links
between attendance levels and pupils' attainment and success.''
The links would be confirmed by Scottish Office-commissioned research
which would show that pupils' academic prospects were equally harmed,
whether their absence was authorised or unauthorised.
Other research had confirmed that many pupils were deliberately
missing school, he said. Secondary heads had reported that one in three
pupils were absent at least once from secondary school in one surveyed
week.
Such levels disrupted classrooms and frustrated teachers, the Minister
said..
''The concern about attendance may be greater at the upper stages of
secondary schooling, but the evidence suggests that problems can start
right back in primary schools,'' he said.
The Minister plans to tackle discipline in tandem with initiatives on
school ethos and attendance and absence.
Mr Robertson called on parents to work with schools and authorities
against truancy but criticised those parents who condoned their
children's absence.

GLASGOW Pollok MP Jimmy Dunnachie has dropped out of the running for
the new Govan seat, but his intervention still leaves a bitter
nomination struggle between local councillor and Glasgow Central MP Mike
Watson.
His original decision to stand was seen as a deliberate ploy to open
up the contest and allow Councillor Sarwar a chance to challenge for the
nomination, but in his letter to the Labour Party's Scottish Council
announcing his intention to retire from Westminster politics at the next
General Election he denied any such deal had taken place.
''I wish my good friend of many years' standing, Mohammed Sarwar,
every success in his efforts to win the Govan nomination,'' he wrote.
''I would emphasise that no deals, as have been suggested, have taken
place between Sarwar and myself.''
Mr Dunnachie concluded with a ringing endorsement of his ally: ''In
recent months, Mohammed Sarwar has had the book thrown at him in what
has been described as a dirty political campaign. But he has towered
above the jibes to survive with honour.''
Mr Watson did not respond to the news yesterday but one of his close
allies said the move was entirely predictable and showed up what a
manoeuvre the entire affair had been. This would eventually work in Mr
Watson's favour, he suggested.
Meanwhile, Glasgow Hillhead MP George Galloway beat challenger Shiona
Waldron at the second of three party branch nomination meetings for the
new Kelvin seat.
Mr Galloway set up a large video screen and telephone link to a
meeting of the Anderston/City branch so that he could make his
presentation without missing the Nolan vote at Westminster. He was
nominated by 24 votes to 11.
Ms Waldron has decided to take temporary leave of absence from her job
as a depute-fiscal to see through the fight in the next few days and her
supporters believe she can push Mr Galloway into a full-scale selection
battle.
She said she was unable to comment on the vote as she was forbidden to
do so by the selection procedures.
A third would-be challenger, David Gilmore, 28, who works at the
Castlemilk Law Centre, failed to find a seconder. The final branch
meeting, at Scotstoun/Broomhill, takes place tonight, but the definition
of the two-thirds margin the MP needs to stave off a full ballot is
disputed by the two sides.

HEART surgery of a different kind is being pioneered in Scotland using
revolutionary laser treatment, according to consultant heart surgeon
Ciro Campanella.
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary NHS Trust is piloting developments in the
treatment of heart disease, using laser equipment which improves the
flow of blood through the heart.
Two patients have already gone through the new treatment. Mrs
Josephine Paterson from Leith, and 63-year-old former lorry driver
Robert McGregor, from Caithness, are currently recovering from the new
treatment -- and expect to be home soon.
Similar treatment has already been done at Papworth in England, famed
for its pioneering work in heart treatment and transplants, but the
equipment costing #100,000, in Edinburgh, will help hundreds of patients
and give them a better quality of life.
Basically, the laser punches holes into the heart muscle, improving
blood flow. The system was developed after studying the hearts of
reptiles. In snakes, blood is released from the inner chamber to the
surrounding muscle.
Mr Campanella explained yesterday that while the human heart was
different to those of reptiles, the theory was that if holes were bored
into the heart chamber, the muscle could be nourished by the improvement
of blood flow.
''It is a very straightforward procedure and we are confident with it.
If coronary bypass surgery cannot be done, the laser can be applied,''
he said.
Mrs Paterson said: ''I feel fine. Since last April, I could hardly
breathe and could not walk up a hill, due to angina.
''It is lovely to wake up in the morning and be able to breathe, and
forget about the tablets I have been chewing for ages.''
Mr McGregor had to give up his driving job due to his condition and
agreed it was ''wonderful'' to wake up pain free.
''I am feeling better than I have done in months,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Drying clothes started fatal fire</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975503640</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WARNING against drying clothes in front of a fire was issued
yesterday at the end of an inquiry into the deaths of a mother and three
young children.
The fatal accident inquiry at Dumfries Sheriff Court examined the
deaths of Ms Elizabeth McPhillips, 17, her two children John Wallace,
nine months, and Sarah Jane, 21 months, and another child Sophie Reid,
five months.
It found the house, at 19 Shawhill Court, Annan, Dumfriesshire, was
gutted after clothing, left to dry on a fire guard in the living room,
caught fire on February 9.
Sheriff Kenneth Barr said the deaths might have been prevented had
batteries not been removed from the smoke detectors in the house.
He determined the fire had spread throughout the two-storey house and
was the cause of death of all four.
The inquiry heard how Sophie Reid's brother, Stefan, had woken their
mother, Sharon, enabling them to escape the blazing house. But Ms
McPhillips and daughter, Sarah Jane, were found burned to death in an
upstairs bedroom and babies John and Sophie were found in the living
room after desperate attempts to rescue them had failed.
''The evidence led at the inquiry clearly established the cause of the
fire to have been ignition of the clothing which had been placed to dry
on top of the guard around the gas fire in the living room,'' said
Sheriff Barr.
''Clothing placed in such a position can become so hot as to ignite
even although a flame has not been applied directly to it.
''I have dealt in my findings with danger inherent in this way of
drying clothes in the hope that the publicity occasioned by this inquiry
will make this danger more appreciated.
''The other finding as to precaution relates to smoke detectors. The
evidence established that there were no batteries in the two detectors
in the house, although there had been such batteries in September 1994
when plumbers engaged in other work routinely checked the
smoke-detection equipment.
''Clearly, had the smoke detectors been operational on February 9, the
likelihood is that the adults in the house would have had earlier
warning of the outbreak of the fire and would have had more time to
react to it before it became so fully and extensively established.''
0 Sheriff Barr also addressed concerns that the windows of the house
had hampered rescue attempts and that the carpet had fuelled the spread
of the fire.
He said: ''There was no evidence that the design of this particular
window had any material part in causing or contributing to the deaths
which occurred in this fire.''
Sheriff Barr said he could not make a recommendation regarding the
carpet as tests carried out at the Fire Research Station at Gasront had
not included a comparison with more traditional types of carpet.

A MAJOR campaign to reduce the number of deaths and injuries from
pedestrian road accidents among Scotland's pre- school age children was
launched yesterday.
Every Scottish child is to be targeted, with the assistance of health
board records, in a bid to recruit them to a nationwide Children's
Traffic Club through which they will be provided with free road safety
advice up to the age of five.
The hope is that the initiative -- borrowed from Scandinavian
countries, where the club concept was introduced more than 25 years ago
-- will contribute to existing efforts to reduce child casualty figures
by one-third by the end of the century, compared with the 1980-1985
average.
The launch of the club is to be backed up by a new television
commercial which was filmed at Kyleakin Primary School, on Skye, where
pupils helped create animated characters and backdrops.
The Scottish Office is providing #320,000 annually towards the running
of the club, which will also receive support from the General Accident
insurance company and health boards.
Speaking at the launch of the club in Edinburgh, Scottish Roads and
Transport Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said child pedestrian
fatalities last year had fallen by 14% compared with 1993 and were now
60% below their early 1980s level. Non-fatal casualties had been reduced
to 27% below their level 10 years ago.
However, he stressed: ''One child casualty is one too many.''

TWO IRA men who are high on Britain's list of wanted terrorists are to
make a courtroom bid for bail following the start of extradition
proceedings against them in Dublin yesterday.
Legal efforts to return Brixton prison escapers Nessan Quinlivan and
Pearse McCauley to British police custody began within hours of their
dawn release from the Irish Republic's top-security Portlaoise jail.
They were freed after completing only part of sentences imposed for
firearms offences after their arrests in Ireland two years ago, in the
Dublin Government's continuing response to the Northern Ireland peace
process.
Two other IRA prisoners -- armed robbers serving long jail terms --
got out at the same time, increasing to 36 the number of terrorists
released by the Irish authorities since the start of last year's
ceasefires in Ulster.
However, Quinlivan and McCauley were re-arrested by Irish police and
transferred the 50 miles to Dublin for their court appearances.
The latest prison moves were criticised on both sides of the sectarian
divide in Northern Ireland.
Unionist politicians said the releases amounted to major concessions
to the IRA and republicans condemned the extradition proceedings.
The two men, both aged 30, were remanded in custody for a week. Their
lawyers indicated that the case would be taken to the Irish High Court
later this week in a bid to win bail, pending what are certain to be
lengthy legal procedures.
Quinlivan, from Limerick, and McCauley, from Strabane, County Tyrone,
Northern Ireland, escaped from Brixton in 1991 after producing a gun.
They had been awaiting trial on conspiracy to murder and cause
explosions and firearms charges.
Both were subsequently arrested and jailed in the Irish Republic, with
the extradition applications shelved until yesterday's release move.
A handful of demonstrators protested outside the Dublin courtroom.
They carried placards querying the extradition development in the light
of the current peace process.
Sinn Fein vice-president Pat Doherty, condemning the extradition move,
said it highlighted the British Government's attitude to the issue of
''political'' prisoners.

LORRY driver Robert Duncan was caught by a Customs surveillance team
after he helped to smuggle nearly #60,000 worth of vodka and tobacco
into Scotland, Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
The court was told how Duncan and another man, Thomas Gillespie, were
involved in a scheme to bring cheap vodka into the country from Spain.
Customs officers swooped on Duncan at a seafood premises in Aberdeen.
Duncan, 38, of Berrymuir Road, Macduff, Banffshire, admitted evading
#56,573 in excise duty on vodka and tobacco.
A Customs spokesman said yesterday it was one of the biggest seizures
made in Scotland.
The court heard that Duncan and Gillespie, of Addiewell, West Calder,
West Lothian, had swopped lorries at Kinross service station, off the
M90 between Aberdeen and Edinburgh.
Depute fiscal Derek Buchanan said Customs officers followed Duncan on
two occasions to Hibernia Seafoods in Palmerston Road, Aberdeen.
The first time they saw boxes being unloaded from the back of Duncan's
lorry. On the second occasion, Customs officers and police moved in.
Defence agent Greer McRobert said Duncan was a self-employed lorry
driver and that the scheme involved him getting half the profit from the
smuggled drink.
Sheriff David Kelbie deferred sentence on Duncan for six months for
good behaviour and said it was likely he would be given a fine.
The Crown has deserted criminal proceedings against Gillespie.
* A man who brought a trailer load of alcohol and cigarettes across
the Channel was caught when he tried to sell a crate of beer in
Inverness.
Rowallan Quick, 33, of Mason Road, Inverness, pleaded guilty at
Inverness Sheriff Court yesterday to evading payment of excise duty and
was fined #2500.
Customs officers seized more than 1000 litres of beer and more than
300 litres of wine and spirits as well as tobacco when they examined
Quick's van and trailer.
The vehicles were forfeit to the Crown along with their contents.

Brussels
EURO-MPs are investigating claims that CIA operatives in Britain spied
on the European Union during Gatt world trade negotiations two years
ago.
Mr David Martin, Labour Euro-MP for Lothian, said he viewed with
''horror'' the idea that the Americans were conducting espionage
activities against the EU.
As a vice-president of the European Parliament, he would be looking
into the allegations.
Four of his colleagues -- English Euro-MPs Mr David Bowe, Mr Roger
Barton, Mr Peter Crampton, and Mr Peter Truscott -- have tabled
questions about the activities of personnel working for the CIA in the
UK. Mr Bowe (Cleveland and Richmond) says covert monitoring of EU talks
in the critical period leading to final agreement in the Gatt talks gave
the US an unfair competitive advantage.
He said he had evidence that CIA personnel in Britain had moved into
commercial espionage after the Cold War and he is expected to back up
his claims at next month's parliamentary plenary in Strasbourg.
A spokesman for the UK permanent representation in Brussels said last
night: ''All I can say is that in the kind of negotiation going on at
that time it was important to make sure our negotiating partners in the
end game were kept on the pitch. This meant information being passed on
to the Americans but not in any way which reduced the EU's negotiating
leverage.''
He added: ''If the idea is that the Americans were using
non-conventional means to get information, then I could not comment. I
would have no idea about that.''

A PRISON officer was injured taking part in a mock riot, the object of
which was to learn how to avoid serious injury during a real
disturbance.
A judge has ruled, however, that prison authorities were not to blame
for allowing missiles such as fire extinguishers and metal bars to be
thrown down on Mr Charles Brisco.
Lord Hamilton ruled at the Court of Session that without such
realistic training, prison officers would be at serious risk of severe
injury in actual riot conditions.
Mr Brisco sued the Secretary of State for Scotland, who is reponsible
for the prison service, after the incident at Barlinnie prison in August
1991. It was agreed he should receive #2000 damages if he won his case.
He was taking part in control and restraint training to learn how to
deal with disturbances and avoid serious injury or even death at the
hands of rioting inmates.
He was wearing a helmet and body armour, carrying a shield, and formed
part of a nine-man team advancing in ranks of three. The front line had
six-foot tall shields and the middle line, including Mr Brisco, had
three-foot shields.
Two officers played the role of prisoners and dropped missiles,
including fire extinguishers, metal bars, and heavy pieces of wood from
above.
As the men below negotiated a staircase, their overhead shields, which
had been locked together, disengaged briefly and a piece of wood came
through the gap.
It struck Mr Brisco on the foot and, in spite of his hard-toed boots,
he suffered a fracture of his little toe.
He argued that the prison authorities should not have allowed missiles
of any kind to be thrown while the men were negotiating the stairs and
when it was difficult to keep the shields in a locked position.
Alternatively, he claimed that only soft or light items should have
been thrown.
He accepted that while restraint and control training would inevitably
involve some risk, it was neither necessary nor reasonable to expose
officers to all the risks they might meet during an actual riot.
Lord Hamilton said: ''The violence to which prison officers may be
exposed in the course of action to bring disturbances, including serious
riots, under control, may be of an extreme and life-threatening
character.
''It is accordingly necessary that they be properly trained to deal
with such situations in a way which will minimise the risk of serious
injury or even death to themselves and their fellow officers.''
The judge took the view that effective training involved the
simulation of riot conditions but not assaults which equipment and
protective clothing could not reasonably be expected to withstand.
''On the other hand, the shields are designed to cope with assaults
from above with relatively substantial items such as chairs, wooden
posts, and the like,'' he said.

THE chief executive of the financially-troubled Highland Communities
NHS Trust, Mr St John Hattersley, yesterday resigned from his
#57,000-a-year job ahead of an overwhelming vote of no confidence in him
by doctors and dentists.
Following Mr Hattersley's resignation, there were calls for the trust
chairman, Mr Donald John Mackay, and other board members to consider
their positions.
The trust is responsible for 14 small hospitals throughout the
Highlands and the provision of mental health and community services. In
August, it was revealed that the trust was facing a #1.8m deficit in the
current financial year, with #1m having been attributed to errors in
budget negotiations with Highland Health Board.
In September, Mr Hattersley, 43, announced plans for #1.3m savings,
which included cutting up to 45 jobs. Consideration was also to be given
to closing one of four wards at themain geriatric hospitals in
Inverness. Nurses and support staff announced they would ballot members
on a no-confidence motion and last week, in an unprecedented move,
doctors and dentists said they would do likewise.
The results of these ballots were due this week but yesterday morning
Mr Hattersley issued a statement saying: ''Having taken soundings over
the last few days, it is clear that I no longer have the confidence of
the majority of the doctors and dentists who work for the trust. No
chief executive can be effective unless they have the support of the
staff through whom services are provided.
''In the present circumstances, it is difficult to see how I could
rebuild this confidence and I have therefore written to Donald John
Mackay, chairman of the Highland Communities NHS Trust, submitting my
resignation. I believe that in doing this, I will provide an opportunity
for someone else to step in to lead the trust in a way which will unite
staff and management in the common aim of providing the best services
for patients.''
A trust spokesman said Mr Hattersley would not be making any further
statement and would not be available for interview. Similar advice
accompanied the statement issued by Mr Mackay after an emergency board
meeting yesterday afternoon. This made no mention of any further
resignations.
The statement read: ''The chief executive has always had the support
of the trust board but he recognises that he has lost the confidence of
the majority of the medical and dental staff. In the current difficult
circumstances, the board feels that this conclusion is courageous and
responsible. They accept his decision with great regret, in view of his
integrity, his commitment to the NHS, and his dedication. They wish him
all success in the future.''
Some had expected more. Mr David Robertson, interim staff side
chairman within the trust, said Mr Hattersley's resignation would not
''fully appease'' the staff.
''The resignation of the chief executive is only one step towards
recognition of the trust's failure. It appears to be a recognition only
by him. The trust, by very definition, has failed in its function.
Honesty demands that they recognise that too.
''The Joint Staffs Consultative Committee has had constructive talks
today for the first time and expects to continue to negotiate with
managers to try to relieve Government and trust-created problems for
patients and staff.''
The trust's former finance director, Mr Alastair Christie, who was
sacked following allegations of staff harassment and has since claimed
he was made a scapegoat for the #1m blunder with the health board,
meanwhile called on Mr Mackay to follow his chief executive's example.
Dr Alastair Scott-Brown, a consultant psychiatrist in Inverness, who
was speaking on behalf of the medical and dental staff, said he would
not necessarily want to call for further resignations.
However, doctors and dentists were still deeply concerned about the
trust's financial difficulties. ''The recovery plan is now available but
we are convinced that the proposed financial targets cannot be met.
Services are so mutually inter-dependent that reductions in one area
must have a knock-on effect across all others,'' he said.
Meanwhile, a Scottish Office spokesman said Mr Mackay's position was
unaffected and it would be up to the trust to appoint a new chief
executive.
* Before coming to the Highlands in 1993, Mr St John Hattersley was
chief executive of the Cornwall &amp; Isles of Scilly Family Health Services
Authority, responsible for primary care services. A member of the
Institute of Health Services Management, his first experience within the
NHS was as a nursing assistant.

OPERATION Eagle drug squad officers hailed their first success in
court yesterday when a dealer was jailed for seven years.
Hugh Moffat, 33, was one of the first people arrested in the massive
Strathclyde police anti-drugs drive. Yesterday, he was the first dealer
caught in the operation, which was launched in July, to appear at the
High Court in Glasgow.
Moffat was caught when he sold heroin to undercover police officers
posing as addicts and using marked banknotes at his house in Closburn
Street, Possilpark, Glasgow.
Advocate-depute Bill Dunlop said police found almost 700 Temazepam
tablets with a street value of #2000 and heroin worth about #1000 in his
house.
Moffat, who admitted trafficking in both drugs, had already served a
five-year sentence for drug dealing, the court heard.
Mr Dunlop did not mention Operation Eagle in court and defence
advocate John Morris claimed Moffat was a ''pathetic patsy'' for the
major dealers who rarely were caught.
Since Operation Eagle was launched, 4500 people have been arrested and
drugs valued at #5m have been seized, along with #400,000 in cash and
220,000 Temazepam tablets.
It has been hailed as one of the most successful anti-drugs drives in
Europe and police from all over the world want to visit Strathclyde
police headquarters to learn from the drugs unit.
A police spokesman said: ''Our financial investigation unit will now
look into Moffat's affairs with a view to stripping away any assets he
has from drug dealing.''

A GLASGOW charity founded by parents yesterday opened the first in a
series of small, family-style homes for young adults with profound or
complex learning difficulties.
The McFarlane Homes charity believes the project demonstrates that
Care in the Community can work. It plans several other such schemes and
hopes that many other community groups will follow its example.
Netherlee House has been built in the Netherlee area of the city at a
cost of #460,000 and will accommodate 10 residents. Half of them are
coming from long-stay care at Lennox Castle Hospital, which is to be
closed in a phased programme over the next few years. The rest come from
families who are no longer able to care for their loved ones at home.
The charity aims to provide quality permanent care and accommodation
in the heart of the community.
Yesterday's opening ceremony was performed by Provost Leslie Rosin, of
Eastwood District Council, who praised the ''warm and homely'' features
of the building. The facilities include individual bedrooms as well as a
kitchen, a dining room, a large lounge, and a smaller sitting room.

A FATHER last night hit out at a seven-year sentence imposed on a
14-year-old boy who raped his daughter, 12, and indecently assaulted her
friend after they picnicked in a country park.
''I am disgusted. He should have got 15 years and maybe life. If you
are old enough to commit the crime, you are old enough to pay the full
penalty,'' said the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
''The police will have to watch him when he comes out.''
He said his daughter was slowly recovering from her ordeal: ''She was
very upset but she is beginning to come through it now.
''Kids should be able to go to places like that without animals like
him attacking them.''
He was present at Manchester Crown Court to hear Mr Justice Sachs tell
the rapist: ''You are, in my view, extremely dangerous.
''It is a sick and sad world when young girls can't go out in to the
open air, in to the countryside, because they were subjected by you to
this awful experience.''
The boy, wearing a dark green suit and watched by his parents, stared
impassively ahead as the judge added: ''But I am not a psychologist or
psychiatrist or a commentator on the ills of society.
''I am here to pass upon you the proper sentences for these deeply
nasty offences. That is the task of a judge.''
The boy got seven years after pleading guilty to rape. He was also
given detention sentences of between two and seven years after admitting
kidnap and indecent assault relating to three separate incidents. All
will run concurrently.
The court heard how the boy, who the judge ruled could not be named,
pounced on the two 12-year-old girls at Waterworks Country Park, Oldham,
Greater Manchester, on May 31, 1995.
He tied the naked girls to a tree stump with their shoe-laces,
blindfolded them with their socks, raped one, and indecently assaulted
the other.
They were on school holidays and went for a picnic on their bicycles.
As they started to leave, the boy followed them.
He had been watching them for up to 15 minutes, said Mr Michael
Shorrock QC, prosecuting.
''They were confronted by the defendant. They didn't know who he was.
He was wearing a black balaclava pulled over his face.''
The boy threatened the girls with a knife, made them go to a secluded
spot, and ordered them to strip. He also hit them.
After the attack, he took their clothes. The girls freed themselves
and were found, naked and very distressed, by two passers-by.
The court heard how the boy had planned the attack for a month. He
carried out a similar attack on March 19, on two girls, aged 11 and 12,
in the same area.
Again wearing a balaclava mask and brandishing a knife, he threatened
them and told them to remove their lower clothing before indecently
assaulting them. He stopped when a woman on a horse approached.
He also indecently assaulted another 11-year-old girl on May 30, the
day before the rape.
It was through this attack that police traced the boy because friends
of this girl knew his name.
When questioned by police, the boy admitted the indecent assaults. He
said he planned the first double assault, in March, two weeks before.
''I got the idea from watching a video,'' he told officers.
Mr Shorrock added: ''He admitted wanting to have sex with a girl. His
plan was to do exactly what he did.''

ON the eve of its scheduled auction, the Victoria Cross won by
possibly the most famous Gordon Highlander has been saved as a key
exhibit for the regiment's new #1m museum due to open in Aberdeen next
year.
The famous Dargai VC, awarded to ''Cock o' The North'' piper George
Findlater, and four other decorations won by the Aberdeenshire-born
hero, were to have been offered for sale at an auction in London today
and were expected to fetch more than #55,000.
However, it was announced yesterday that the decorations had been
withdrawn.
Last night, Mr Stuart Allan, who was appointed curator of the new
museum earlier this year, said the medals had been bought privately for
the museum for an undisclosed sum.
He said the agreement was made possible by the generosity of the
Findlater family and through the co-operation of auctioneers Spink and
Son Ltd, both of whom felt that the medals belonged in the regimental
museum.
It was thanks to the generosity of an anonymous private donor, a
substantial grant from the National Museums of Scotland's National Fund
for Acquisitions, and a grant from the Heritage Memorial Fund that the
medals now would be preserved and exhibited for the people of North-east
Scotland, he added.
He said they were within sight of their #1m target for the museum and
the development was now assured.
Lieutenant-General Sir Peter Graham last night was handed the VC and
other medals by Mr Michael Spink, senior director of the auctioneers,
who said: ''We are delighted with the outcome of the negotiations and we
hope that many people will be able to visit the museum and see the
Victoria Cross in its rightful home''
Piper Findlater, who became known as the Hero of Dargai, was shot
through both feet during the attack on Dargai Heights in 1897.
Although unable to stand, he sat up during heavy fire and continued to
play the regimental march -- Cock o' The North -- to spur on his
regiment and encourage their charge during the most famous episode in
the six-month campaign undertaken by the Tirah Expeditionary Force on
the North West Frontier between October 1897 and April 1898.
Orders were given for the hill to be taken ''at all costs'' and, under
murderous crossfire, Findlater -- despite his appalling injuries --
inspired his colleagues with his ''warlike strains''.
The sound of the pipes at the height of the battle encouraged the
Gordon Highlanders to new heights of courage.
Invalided home to recuperate in hospital, Findlater was hailed a hero.
Queen Victoria, moved by public euphoria, presented the VC even before
it had been engraved.
Born at Forgue, Aberdeenshire, in 1872, he was promoted to pipe-major
after the award and retired to Cairnhill Farm, Forglen, Aberdeenshire.
On the outbreak of the First World War, he rejoined the colours and
went with his regiment to France. He was wounded at Loos in July 1915
and invalided out of the Army.
He returned to Aberdeenshire to farm and died at home in 1942, aged
70.

A LAWYER accused of fraud and embezzlement amounting to almost #4m
appeared in the High Court in Glasgow yesterday.
Mr Giles Davies, 40, of Corwar House, Barrhill, Ayrshire, was not
asked to plead and his case was adjourned until next week.
The trial is expected to last about five weeks and 245 witnesses from
across Britain and from Canada, Australia, and other parts of the world
have been cited. Almost 1000 productions, including files and other
documents, have been lodged for the case.
Mr Davies is charged with embezzling #1.7m and almost $1m during a
nine-year period between December 1983 and May 1992 while working as a
solicitor at 66 Victoria Street, Newton Stewart, Wigtownshire, and at 4
Bank Street, Dumfries, and his home in Barrhill.
He is also accused of embezzling #1.4m between December 1991 and May
l992. A third charge alleges that Mr Davies obtained #48,000 by fraud
involving a bank bridging loan.
Temporary Judge Sheriff Robin McEwan, QC, who is to hear the case,
granted yesterday's adjournment.

SIPPING Stag's Breath Highland liqueur in a Finnish pinewood cabin
with a waft of Nepalese scent in the nostrils is just one of the
possibilities offered to delegates at the Junior Chamber International
(JCI) world trade show which opened at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow
yesterday.
The show, which runs until Friday, is the centrepiece of the 50th JCI
world congress, hosted by Glasgow, which was launched on Sunday.
Filling the 70 exhibition stands are companies from countries as
diverse as Togo, Mongolia, Malta, and Croatia. More than 4000 delegates
are expected to attend.
The show aims to provide ''a cocktail of education, information, and
entertainment'' in keeping with the ethos of JCI.
Opening the show, Glasgow city councillor Denis Murphy said: ''The
theme of the congress is 'success through enterprise' and I hope that
the trade show will demonstrate to delegates that we have here in
Glasgow and the west of Scotland is able to compete with the best the
world has to offer.''

EVERTON manager Joe Royle visited his jailed striker, Duncan Ferguson,
in Barlinnie last night. Flanked by the club's chairman, Mr Peter
Johnson, and managing director, Mr Cliff Finch, he refused to comment on
how the player was faring.
The footballer was jailed for three months on October 11 for assault
while playing for Rangers last year.
His solicitor, Mr Blair Morgan, spent half-an-hour talking to him
during last night's visiting period. He said the Scottish Prison Service
would be announcing a release date ''in due course'' and added that the
visit by the Everton officials was ''personal''.
Royle had taken videos of football matches to Barlinnie but prison
officials did not allow him to hand them over, said Mr Morgan. The
footballer was reading football magazines and had received ''sackfuls''
of mail from Everton fans, he added.

TWO Costa Ricans have come to Britain in search of a
multimillion-pound family fortune which has been missing for almost 200
years.
Mauricio Umana and Luis Soto say they are among about 500 descendants
of Juan Rafael Aguilar who have a claim on his fortune, believed to be
worth anything up to #1bn.
Aguilar's father, Toribio Aguilar Salazar, was a wealthy Spanish
banker who deposited his riches in an English bank in 1805, seeing
Britain as a safe haven from the Napoleonic Wars.
When he died, his estate passed to Aguilar who had emigrated to Costa
Rica and established a coffee plantation. He is believed to have never
claimed his inheritance.
Rumours about the money have circulated in Costa Rica since then and
Aguilar's family have passed down the legend of their lost fortune from
generation to generation.
By 1931, when the last attempt to trace the cash was made, it was
thought that the fortune was worth #105m. Its present value is
incalculable but the family's London solicitors Nabarro Nathanson said a
conservative estimate would be around #1bn.
However, they added that bank charges over the years may have left it
worthless, depending on the conditions agreed when it was first
deposited.
Speaking through an interpreter, Spanish-speaking Mr Umana said: ''We
are optimistic about tracking down the money but realistic enough to
know that the chances of finding it after all these years are remote.
''Whether we find the money or not, we will at least have resolved a
family tale that has passed from father to son.''
Any money found would be used to set up a trust fund to benefit all of
the family members, most of whom work on farms, in factories, and on
construction sites, he said.
The two men have been granted power of attorney and authorised by the
family to do whatever is necessary to find the money.
Solicitor Alison Spicer said that finding out where the money was
originally deposited was the biggest hurdle facing them.
She said: ''The banking system has dramatically changed over the last
200 years. There has been a consolidation of banks and records were
destroyed during bombing raids in the Second World War.
''We also do not know which city the money was deposited in. It could
be London or any of the other major port towns of that time.
''We have already been in touch with all the major UK banks and they
have been very helpful but we have so far drawn a blank.''
The cash may not even have been put in a bank but in some other
financial institution and bankers' charges agreed when it was deposited
could have eaten it away, she added.

THE newly-launched Conservative newspaper, the Scottish Leader,
provoked controversy yesterday over claims that a ''tartan tax'' to fund
a Scottish parliament would cost taxpayers north of the Border an extra
#24 a month.
The front page attacked Labour and Liberal Democrat plans and said a
new tax would be imposed to pay for ''129 more politicians and party
place-men and for thousands of bureaucrats''.
The article claimed it would strip the new local councils of power,
setting itself up ''as a large, expensive regional council''.
Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said the figures
quoted failed to take account of national insurance contributions and
branded the publication ''shoddy'' and ''dishonest''.
''The most notable feature of this glorified newsletter is its gross
cover-up of the Tories' tax record,'' said Mr Robertson.
He added: ''The 'tartan tax' is a piece of pure Forsyth fiction. David
McLetchie's admission that the Tories are using the term 'tartan tax' as
a revenge for Labour's campaign against the poll tax shows the depths to
which the Tories will stoop. The tartan tax is a lie. The poll tax was
all too real.''
The leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Jim Wallace, said
continued Tory claims of a tartan tax showed a ''total lack of
understanding'' of the proposals.
A spokesman for the Scottish National Party said: ''This publication
should be called The Misleader, because all it does is recycle fiddled
figures and run Scotland down.''
The four-page newspaper, which is to be distributed to almost 500,000
homes across Scotland, was launched by the party in the Edinburgh
constituency of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.

THE call for full disclosure of private interests by MPs yesterday
received the support of the smaller parliamentary parties.
At a Westminster news conference, Shadow Leader of the House Mrs Ann
Taylor said the Scottish and Welsh Nationalists, as well as the two main
Ulster parties, would call on their MPs to oppose the committee's
recommendation.
Mrs Taylor, flanked by Liberal Democrat MP Robert Maclennan and SNP
leader Alex Salmond, said those MPs who failed to support full
disclosure, or who did not vote, would be held accountable by the
electorate.
''It is so important that we believe our constituents will not
understand if we dodge this issue,'' Mrs Taylor said. ''It's a free
vote. Free votes don't have sanctions except with constituents. Every
single vote of every single MP will matter today. Every Member of
Parliament will have to be ready to explain how they voted.''
She named former Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux, Social
Democratic and Labour Party MP Seamus Mallon, and Plaid Cymru leader
Daffyd Wygley as those who backed Labour. ''They will be encouraging
their parliamentary colleagues to do likewise,'' she said.
Mr Maclennan said the intention was to ensure that MPs' declared
earnings that were related to their work as MPs.
''That seems to me the least Parliament can do to satisfy the needs of
the moment,'' Mr Maclennan said. ''It's not a party political issue. It
is Parliament as a whole whose reputation is at stake.''
Mr Salmond said disclosure of earnings was a minimum requirement in
the light of public concern. Some would argue for MPs to be banned from
having any outside interests, he said.
''Some of us would be happy to argue that tax returns should be
published as the price of being in public life,'' he said.

SCHOOLBOY Tory Justin Hinchcliffe branded party chairman Brian
Mawhinney a ''dictator'' and said he would start his own party after
being suspended from his local Conservative association.
Justin, 14, gained media notoriety after being chosen to represent
Tottenham Tories at last month's party conference.
The boy, who revels in his claim to be ''even more Right-wing than
Margaret Thatcher'', yesterday hit back at his suspension.
Justin said: ''They said being a member of the Conservative Party was
affecting my education. That's totally untrue. The fact is they've
suspended me because of my right-wing views. The dictator -- I should
say Dr Brian Mawhinney -- was behind all this.''
Justin said his party would be called the Independent Conservatives
but have the same policies as the existing Tory party.

AMID noisy scenes and calls of ''resign'' from the Labour benches, MPs
voted last night in favour of a proposals that they should have to
disclose how much they are paid for outside consultancy work.
In a move which clearly will be seen as a snub to John Major and other
senior Conservatives, they voted by 322 to 271, a majority of 51, in
favour of a Labour proposal which says earnings must be declared.
A full copy of earnings in bands of up to #1000, #1000 to #5000, #5000
to #10,000 and then upwards in bands of #5000 will now have to be lodged
with the parliamentary Commissioner for Standards at the same time as it
is placed in the Register of Members' Interests.
Labour MPs waved their order papers when the result was declared.
Commons Leader Tony Newton had urged MPs to back recommendations from
the Select Committee on Public Standards and throw out Labour's call for
the full disclosure of payments relating to their position as Members of
Parliament.
Opening last night's debate, he hailed the package of reforms as ''the
most significant strengthening of the rules for decades'' and said it
represented a ''carefully thought out and comprehensive package''.
However Labour's Shadow Leader of the House, Ann Taylor, said members
of the House who were relying on the argument that the select committee
was going further than the Nolan Report as justification for
non-disclosure of money from parliamentary-related work should be aware
that ''the argument just does not hold up.''
The debate featured a strong contribution from former Tory Prime
Minister Sir Edward Heath, who said he did not think the public had the
right to know what MPs earned outside the Commons.
''It has a right to know about our public salaries, of course, but we
have a right to privacy,'' he said. ''It has a right to know about our
public position and our public rewards, but not about our private
activities.''
Mr Newton claimed, as Mr Major had previously, that the proposal to
ban paid advocacy went significantly further than the curbs proposed by
Lord Nolan, but it soon became clear that MPs from both sides of the
Commons were concerned about its possible impact.
Several Tories complained it would inhibit their ability to speak up
on issues and Labour's Tony Banks, who previously has expressed
reservations about the change, said he received support from the
International Fund for Animal Welfare to employ an additional member of
staff.
''If I continue to do so am I then prevented from initiating debates
and asking questions and putting down Bills or early day Motions?''
Mr Newton told him that under the changes ''if you are receiving
payment or a benefit in kind such as the payment for a research
assistant the answer would be 'yes'.''
The ban on advocacy was a major extension to the House's rules, he
said, adding: ''The key to our approach is that members should not be
paid to initiate parliamentary proceedings or to initiate them on behalf
of clients to whom they are paid advisers. In other words, they should
not advocate in Parliament the cause of outside interests from which
they receive remuneration.''
Mrs Taylor recalled that last week Mr Major had said MPs were entitled
to the same tax privacy as others. Labour agreed with this, but the
point was irrelevant to what was being debated.
Nolan had said that full declaration was especially important in
respect of paid activities relating to Parliament, she said.
''The select committee points out that these payments are only
received by MPs because we are Members of this House. We would not be
receiving them if we were not Members of this House. Therefore they
should be public and therefore our constituents do have a right to
know.''
She claimed the scares about income tax returns being made public were
no more than smokescreens and a diversion from the central issue.
Tory former Minister Sir John Stanley (Tonbridge and Malling) backed
the disclosure move.
''I personally do not have any objection on grounds of principle to
the proposition that where a Member of this House supplements their
income by providing parliamentary services to outside bodies, then both
the source of those outside interests and the quantum of the sums earned
should be declarable.''
For the Liberal Democrats, Robert Maclennan, urged full disclosure,
describing as ''specious and unconvincing'' the claims that the need for
it has been removed by banning paid advocacy.
However, he said the debate did not concern only political morality
and ''the venal behaviour of some, and I believe not very many, MPs''
He said it also was about the huge increase in the volume of
legislation going through Parliament and the inadequacy of consultation
about it with the people it would affect.
This had led to the growth in the ''army'' of consultants lobbying
Parliament.
Tory ex-Minister Sir Terence Higgins (Worthing), a member of the
select committee into the Nolan recommendations, claimed that the issue
of MPs' salaries had to be dealt with at the same time as the Nolan
recommendations.
Sir Terence, who has three directorships and lists one consultancy and
one role as an adviser in the Register of Members Interests, said that
unless MPs were paid an appropriate salary, the Commons would be filled
with ''placemen and paranoics''.
He said: ''We are in a serious recruitment crisis as far as this House
is concerned.''
Sir Terence urged that MPs' pay should be doubled and Ministers'
trebled.

FORMER police chief Alison Halford has told how she was questioned by
Cypriot police after allegedly kneeing an airport official in the groin
after her holiday flight was delayed.
The former Merseyside assistant chief constable said she was accused
of assaulting a Cyprus Airways manager at Larnaca Airport during her
return trip from a two-week holiday in Paphos.
Miss Halford, 55, who was involved in a sex discrimination case
against Merseyside Police, accused the manager of ''the most horrible
display of rudeness and surliness I have ever seen''.
She claims she was assaulted after she tried to challenge a Cyprus
Airways' duty manager about why her flight to Manchester was delayed.
Miss Halford said the manager lost his temper and pushed her.
Police were called but no action was taken and the flight eventually
left, 30 hours late, said Miss Halford, who is now a county councillor
in Flintshire, North Wales.
A spokesman for Cyprus Airways said it was investigating the incident.

A COUPLE, whose heart-defect baby died after being turned away from a
hospital emergency department without full-time doctors, yesterday
rejected the findings of an inquiry into the tragedy.
Ryan Smith, 11 months, died at a GP's surgery after a staff nurse at
the Accident and Emergency Department at Berwick-upon-Tweed Infirmary,
Northumberland, asked his parents to take him there.
The inquiry into Ryan's death on October 3 found it probably would
have occurred whether he was treated at the hospital or the surgery.
But the report said the significance of his condition was not fully
appreciated and recommended that in future all children under the age of
12 should have their temperature, pulse, and respiration recorded.
It also suggested there should be a minimum of two nurses on duty at
the emergency department.
A nurse has already been suspended and could face disciplinary action
after Ryan's medical record was altered following his death but the
inquiry ruled that action had no effect on the case.
It also concluded that employment of a resident doctor at Berwick was
not justified and would not have made any difference in Ryan's case.
Gordon and Angela Smith, of Berwick, rejected the inquiry's findings
at a news conference yesterday.
''How the staff nurse failed to recognise how seriously ill Ryan was,
we will never understand,'' Mrs Smith said.
''If the staff nurse had examined Ryan, we feel sure he would never
have been moved from this highly equipped hospital to a
not-so-well-equipped GP's surgery.
''It seems obvious to Gordon and myself that, as Ryan didn't receive
immediate medical treatment he desperately needed, it possibly
contributed to his death.
''If he had been admitted to the hospital, it surely would have
avoided our baby a lot of pain and distress which he did suffer, which
we witnessed in the GP's surgery.
''Then at least we would have the satisfaction of knowing everything
that was humanly possible was done for Ryan. This uncertainty will live
with us for the rest of our lives.''

SOLDIERS and statesmen sobbed and sirens wailed as Israel yesterday
buried its war hero and peacemaker Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated by a
fellow Jew who opposed his peace with Palestinians.
Mourners, ranging from US President Bill Clinton to Rabin's
granddaughter, eulogised the prime minister who died after being shot at
a Saturday night peace rally in Tel Aviv.
The whole of Israel stood in silent tribute for two minutes when
sirens that each year commemorate the Nazi Holocaust marked the start of
the two-hour funeral on a Jerusalem hilltop. Seven soldiers fired three
volleys over the grave of the Six Day War army commander to conclude the
emotional ceremony. Around 4500 mourners stood beneath the pines and
cypresses of Mount Herzl National Cemetery.
Jewish student Yigal Amir confessed in a Tel Aviv court yesterday to
killing Rabin, saying: ''I acted alone but maybe with God.''
At the funeral, President Clinton, wearing a black Jewish skullcap,
told Israelis: ''The American people mourn with you in the loss of your
leader and I am one with you, for he was my partner and friend.
''Your Prime Minister was a martyr for peace but he was a victim of
hate. Surely we must learn from his martyrdom that if people cannot let
go of the hatred of their enemies, they risk sowing the seeds of hatred
among themselves.''
He said Rabin ''took up arms to defend Israel's freedom and laid down
his life to secure Israel's future''.
''Now it falls to all of us who love peace and all of us who loved him
to carry on the struggle to which he gave life and for which he gave his
life,'' said the US president, ending his address with: ''And shalom,
haver (friend).''
The presence at the funeral of officials from six Arab states, and
from Israel's former arch-enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
would have been unthinkable just three years ago and was a measure of
the diplomatic breakthrough achieved by the Jewish state under Rabin.
Jordan's King Hussein and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, two of
Rabin's key partners in Middle East peacemaking, both delivered
eulogies.
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, who did not attend for what were called
political and security reasons, watched the ceremony on television at
his Gaza City office. ''He was quite moved,'' an aide reported. ''He
said: 'We have lost a cousin. It's a tragedy'.''
Israel Television focused repeatedly on King Hussein in his
red-and-white chequered keffiyeh headdress, his face etched in sorrow.
His speech was an emotional, personal tribute to a friend and partner.
''He had courage, he had vision, and he had a commitment to peace,''
the monarch said as he stood beside Rabin's coffin draped in the
blue-and-white Star of David flag.
The most moving tribute came not from the men of power praising a
fellow world leader but from Rabin's granddaughter, emotionally
describing the grandfather she loved.

HUNDREDS of air travellers were caught up in an unofficial strike by
British Airways staff at Heathrow yesterday.
Dozens of flights were cancelled and others delayed for at least 90
minutes.
The 90 BA supervisors are protesting at the airline's decision to
employ language students at the airport. A BA spokeswoman said the
students were to help non-English speaking passengers at check-in desks.
Most passengers were accommodated on alternative airlines but those
connecting to international flights had to reclaim their bags on arrival
and check in again.
A spokesman for the Transport and General Workers Union said he could
not comment because the action was unofficial.

THE US Department of Energy, the British Embassy in Washington, and

public outcry over Dounreay's proposal to reprocess spent nuclear fuel

The group has published a leaked letter between the two departments

The letter allegedly is from the US Office of Spent Fuel Management at
the Department of Energy to Dr David Lumley of the DTI in London and Mr
Mark Hammond of the British Embassy in Washington.
It mentions correspondence from groups protesting against Dounreay's
declared intention to reprocess a considerable number of the 15,000
spent nuclear fuel rods currently stockpiled at research reactors around
the world awaiting transfer.
The fuel is of American origin and had been due to be returned there,
but its movement has been delayed as the US Department of Energy
consulted public opinion throughout the summer.
The UK Government has said there will be no such consultation here.
A DTI spokeswoman said last night that she could make no comment on
the letter at this stage, but Dounreay had been reprocessing nuclear
fuel for more than 30 years.

FOUR men were shot to death and another was critically wounded
yesterday when two gunmen walked into a crowded restaurant in Boston's
Charlestown district and opened fire on them at their lunch table.
The shooting occurred during the peak lunch hour when two gunmen
entered the Ninety Nine restaurant, got into an argument with the
victims at their table, then pumped several shots into them at close
range, police said.
Captain Edward McNelly confirmed that four men had been killed and a
fifth was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital with a serious
stomach wound.
The suspects were arrested as they ran into a nearby car park where a
getaway car was waiting. Witnesses said two off-duty policemen who were
having lunch chased the gunmen as they left the restaurant, shouted at
them to ''freeze'', then arrested them.
When asked if it had been a gangland execution, Boston Police
Commissioner Paul Evans replied: ''If it was a hit, it was a very sloppy
hit -- broad daylight and in a crowded restaurant.''

MPs will have to declare their earnings from outside interests, the
House of Commons decided overwhelmingly last night in a historic vote.
Supporters of disclosure carried the day by 322 votes to 271, a larger
than expected margin of 51.
About 20 Conservative MPs joined Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and
minor parties to sweep away the current practice that, while interests
are registered, details of earnings are confidential. Among them was Mr
Allan Stewart, MP for Eastwood.
Mr Stewart said: ''I was voting for Parliament and not in any sense
against the Government or for the Labour Party. I think there's
widespread concern about standards in public life.
''Despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of MPs are very
decent and completely honest and hard-working, to disclose earnings is a
perfectly reasonable proposition. MPs individually will be far better
off as a result and will stop all sorts of misleading rumours going
round about outside earnings.''
Though technically a free vote on a House of Commons matter, both
Government and Opposition lobbied their MPs hard. Mr Major said publicly
that he expected Tory MPs to back him in the lobbies. A good number had
no stomach for doing so and abstained, including Sir Hector Monro
(Dumfries) and Mr Phil Gallie (Ayr).
Mr Stewart said he consulted with his Eastwood constituency chairman,
who did not press him to vote for disclosure. Nor was he pressured by
Tory Whips, he said, despite the reports that the Government had worked
hard to ensure victory. Instead, he was approached by a Tory member of
the Select Committee, who asked him to carefully consider the Government
position.
In another historic decision, opposed by only two MPs, the Commons
voted to ban any MP from acting as an advocate for outside paymasters by
asking questions, initiating debates or tabling amendments to Bills.
Mrs Ann Taylor, Shadow Leader of the Commons, said: ''This has been a
very good night for the reputation of Parliament and a terrible night
for the reputation of John Major.
Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, said: ''This is the start of the
derailing of the Tory gravy train. It is a personal humiliation for John
Major who, having bowed to pressure from his back benchers, is now
stranded like a beached whale.''
However, Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the Commons and chairman of the
Select Committee whose recommendations were before the House, said: ''I
don't think the Prime Minister will see this as some kind of defeat. He
accepted the broad thrust of the Nolan Report.
''He sought to have some of the problems addressed and now they have
been addressed.''
Mr Newton refused to say he was disappointed by the outcome. ''We have
made the most important strengthening of the rules of the House of
Commons for certainly 20 years, in my view 50 or more years.''
The Prime Minister, absent at Mr Yitzhak Rabin's funeral, told the
Commons last week that if MPs were banned from acting as advocates of
their paymaster's causes there was no need for what they earned
otherwise as consultants to be made public.
However, Labour spokesman Jeff Rooker told MPs minutes before the
vote: ''Secrecy of earnings which are directly related to elected
membership of this House sends a message that we are on the make. This
taints us with sleaze.''
The new rules will apply from next week when the new session of
Parliament opens on November 15. MPs will have to set out any contracts
they have in writing and what they gain from them expressed in bands of
up to #1000, #1000-#5000, #5000-#10,000 and thereafter in bands of
#5000.
An attempt by some angry Tories to defeat another Labour proposal that
these details must be available for public inspection was beaten by 325
votes to 202, majority 123.
Even a Tory who wanted disclosure delayed until the next Parliament,
Mr David Wilshire (Spelthorne), said: ''I am fed up with being called a
sleazebag.'' He said he was sure most MPs were decent and honourable but
the well-publicised activities of a few had led the public to another
conclusion and MPs had to do something about it.
''If it hurts, I'm afraid we have only ourselves to blame,'' he said.
Members who have outside earnings not connected with their work as
MPs, for example lawyers and farmers, will not have to declare earnings
from their occupation. Mrs Taylor said there was no question of Labour
proposing, as had been put about, that MPs' income tax returns would be
made public.
The size of the Tory revolt, those who stayed away -- most of the
60-odd abstainers -- as well as those who voted with Labour, indicated
that Mr Major has again been poorly served by his Whips' office. Had
they warned him that was likely to happen he might have avoided going
out on a limb against disclosure.
He may also be regretting setting up the Nolan committee into
standards in public life whose findings mostly applied to Conservative
MPs, instead of dealing with the cash-for-questions issue which sparked
its appointment, in another way.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''This is a stinging
humiliation for the Prime Minister and for the Cabinet, who have been
totally wrong-footed.''
There was speculation last night that the move to make MPs publish
details of their earnings could result in some MPs on the Tory side
stepping down at the next election rather than face public scrutiny.
A Tory die-hard opponent of disclosure moves, Sir Michael Neubert
(Romford) last night threatened to flout the new rule. He made plain
that there was nothing to force him to abide by the rules of the House
because they were not laid down in law.
