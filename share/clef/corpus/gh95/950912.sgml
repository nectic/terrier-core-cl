A WOMAN student died from stab wounds, police said last night.
Rachael Lean's body was found in undergrowth near the RAF base where
her father is stationed.
But detectives still do not know when Miss Lean, 18, died, or how many
wounds she suffered. No weapon has yet been found and no motive has been
established, they said.
A 27-year-old woman, thought to be a friend of Miss Lean, was arrested
on Sunday evening after going to North Walsham police station in
Norfolk.
Last night, Cromer magistrates granted detectives a further 36 hours
to question her.
Sergeant John Smith, of Norfolk Constabulary, said Miss Lean's
divorced parents, Peter and Vanessa, would formally identify the body
this morning.
He said: ''Final inquiries into the post-mortem are not yet complete.
The family has been extremely helpful considering the circumstances,
particularly because the body has not yet been finally identified.''
Miss Lean failed to return to her home in Buxton last Tuesday after
going to the Naafi shop at the RAF Coltishall base.
Her body was found on Sunday, a few hundred yards from a private road
near the base.
Miss Lean was last seen chatting to a friend, Maria Hnatiuk, who then
left for Bristol to visit her mother.
Miss Lean's father, Peter, 43, an RAF technician serving with a Jaguar
squadron on UN Bosnian peace-keeping missions, flew home on Thursday to
help his estranged wife and their 16-year-old son Steven with the
search.
Close relatives have gathered at the Leans' home to offer their
support.
Family friend Jack Tomlinson, a retired vicar, said last night: ''I
think they knew, and the whole village knew, when the body was found
that it had to be Rachael's. The family has really come together over
this. Several relatives have come down to the house, it is just full of
family.
''I think the children in the village will be devastated by this.
Peter is trying to prepare for what must come next.''
Miss Lean had a part-time job at the Marks &amp; Spencer store in Norwich
for two years.
Personnel manager Trish Hitchins said: ''We are all devastated by the
news. Rachael was one of our staff and she was a lovely girl. We are
feeling very much for her parents and we are very concerned about the
situation.''

It's tough as Old Firm head into the unknown. . . one having to avoid
a war zone, the other on a journey of discovery.
CELTIC'S European plans were changed again yesterday after warnings to
their travel agents had informed them that they were entering a ''war
zone.''
The initial arrangement had been to take Celtic into Istanbul tonight
and then, 24 hours before the match, to move them directly across the
Black Sea to the resort town of Batumi where they play their European
Cup-winners' Cup tie against the local side, Dinamo.
Yesterday, that was altered, and what would have been a flight of an
hour and 50 minutes was changed into a three-hour journey -- added to
the five-hour trip which will take the team into the Turkish capital.
A spokesman for the travel company told me last night:''We have been
banned from taking the original route because we would be flying through
a war zone. The charter plane which will take us in must now take a
three-hour journey instead of what we had planned, which was less than
two hours.
''This has not been an easy trip to organise because of the lack of
information available to anyone who is entering Georgia. Even the kick
off was changed today because of a problem with their floodlights. And
that has altered our plans for the journey back home.
''We are essentially going into the unknown, and Celtic realise
that.''
Meanwhile, back at Celtic Park, manager Tommy Burns is ready for this
trip. Burns looks at the whole thing in terms of his club and their
recent lack of European involvement.
''Look,''he told me yesterday, ''this is a first time in Europe for
some players and a chance to get back there for some of the others. We
are all looking forward to that part of it, the football side. That is
what counts most.''
Burns, of course, is right. The travel troubles and the accommodation
worries and the inoculations don't matter to the vast public who follow
Celtic.
They have had most of these troubles themselves by now when they go on
holiday, and all that matters is how Celtic perform.
When it comes down to that, then the fans can anticipate them playing
on a high after Sunday's exhibition at Pittodrie.
But, even there, Celtic have their worries. The two men who limped off
in Aberdeen remain in doubt.
And it could even be the case that striker Pierre van Hooydonk, the
new Parkhead hero, could be left behind. Again, the giant Dutchman could
be a victim of the travel difficulties which surround Celtic's trip to
Georgia.
He has a hamstring strain and Burns worries over the added
complications which could hit the player when he has to face long
journeys in cramped conditions.
Celtic face around nine hours in the air each way and Burns admits:
''That is a worry when a player has this type of injury. We might decide
to leave Pierre at home and have him ready for the game against
Motherwell.''
As well as van Hooydonk, Celtic also have concerns over Tosh McKinlay
who suffered a back injury in the weekend clash. Yesterday Burns
appeared confident that McKinlay would be OK for the European trip but,
again, the troublesome travel may come into play before any decision is
made.
McKinlay has had back problems before, and it could be that these are
something he is able to shrug off. That has to be the hope for the
Scottish Cup holders.
As well as the nightmare travel scenario, the team have to accommodate
a four-hour time problem, and yesterday, they also had a kick-off change
to contend with.
Now the match will start at five o'clock local time (1pm here) because
the new floodlights at the ground have not been finished in time.
Surprise, surprise.

GOLF TIP
* THIS week's tip comes from STEVE CRAIG, the professional at
Dunfermline Golf Club.
THIS is the hinge-hit-hinge drill that will help produce the proper
release, and clubhead speed, through the ball.
The aim is to have the hands hinged at the same angle at hip height on
both the backswing and follow through (see above).
On the downswing the right hand APPEARS to roll over the left. The
common fault among handicap players is that they try and keep the right
hand under the left in the hitting area and on the follow through.
As a result, the blade opens and the ball will fly low and right. The
shot is also likely to be hit rather thin.
With the correct action, the clubface will stay square through impact,
the clubhead will be released properly and there will be good, fast
action with the hands.
I have my own releasing device -- it was put together by an engineer
at Rosyth dockyard -- that helps promote the correct action.
It is a very heavy weighted, short golf shaft that is angled up to at
around 30 degrees towards the golfer. When you make a swing, it is
impossible to do anything except release the hands properly. Everyone
should have one.

GLASGOW promoter Tommy Gilmour yesterday pulled off one of his most
successful deals ever when he announced that Paul Weir, the WBO
light-flyweight champion from Irvine, would defend his title against
Baby Jake Matlala in Glasgow -- despite a huge offer to have the fight
staged in South Africa.
Weir will meet the former flyweight champion of the world, the man who
dethroned Scotland's Pat Clinton, at the Kelvin Hall on Saturday,
November 18, and with the capacity restricted to 2500, it is certain to
be a sell-out.
The City of Glasgow, through Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall, has invited
South African President Nelson Mandela to be guest of honour on the big
night. ''I think there is a good chance the president will accept,''
said Gilmour. ''He is a freeman of the city, and, on the same day,
England will be playing the South African rugby side at Twickenham. He
could attend both events.''
The showdown looked certain to go to South Africa, but Gilmour,
despite big money being offered by Sun City, has beaten everyone to the
punch-up.
The Glasgow promotion will cost around #300,000, but according to the
promoter, three major sponsors are battling for the right to pour in
cash. ''I've even had offers of sponsorship from South Africa, because
Baby Jake is a national hero over there,'' said Gilmour.
''Paul offered to take a #25,000 cut in his money if I got the fight
for Glasgow. But being his manager as well as promoter, I wouldn't have
that. Paul will get the same cash for fighting at home as he would have
done for going to Sun City.''
Matlala lost his flyweight crown to Mexico's Alberto Jiminez in a
tremendous fight in South Africa last November, but, because of his all
action style, he is still a major attraction.
Said Gilmour: ''This is a genuine fight where the home guy is no
certainty to win.
''But what a great opportunity this is for Paul. If he wins it will
give him security for the rest of his life and, in beating Baby Jake it
will turn him from being a good fighter into a great fighter.''
This will be 33-year-old Matlala's fifty-fifth contest and his seventh
world title fight.
Weir, however, is confident he can hold on to his title. He said:
''The recognition factor is the important thing about this fight,
because everyone knows Baby Jake's capabilities -- he's a great fighter,
who never stops. Every fight he is involved in is exciting.
''No one, however, has seen the best of Paul Weir yet. They have maybe
seen me at my best in one or two rounds of my previous fights, but this
time I'll have to produce it for maybe 12 rounds to let people see I am
the real article.''
The fight will be shown live on ITV and will also be beamed live to
millions in South Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas.
A major undercard will be announced, probably next week, and tickets
will be on sale from today, priced from #60-#20.

HE HAS not been dropped too often in his long career but Alex McLeish
still had that famous vital spark to parascend into Strathclyde Park
yesterday as a spectacular launch of a fund-raising scheme for the
Cancer Relief MacMillan Fund. The Motherwell manager was doing his bit
for the World's Biggest Coffee Morning on September 29, sponsored by
Nescafe, when thousands of people throughout Britain are expected to
turn out to try to set a new coffee-drinking record.
The target is the Guinness Book Of Records entry set by Cancer Relief
last year of 433,544 drinkers and, if successful, it is hoped to raise
more than #1m. Happily, McLeish, not for the first time, landed on his
feet.
Above, McLeish has a bit of the gung-ho look about him as he enjoys
heading for terra firma, while on the left, his enjoyment of the
''exercise'' is obvious -- much better than the slog of training.

RANGERS begin their journey to Bucharest this morning prepared to do
what ever will be necessary to secure their first Champions League point
at least, but the Ibrox side are also setting out on a journey of
discovery. Walter Smith and his players will find out as much about
themselves as their opponents, Steaua Bucharest, tomorrow night which
will be the first real test of the strengths and desires of the new-look
Rangers.
Thus far, the defensive system put in place by Smith has held firm,
and the desperately required flair he is trying to introduce mainly
through Brian Laudrup and Paul Gascoigne is beginning to shine through,
but it is in Romania that Rangers will step into the big boys'
playground for the first time this season.
Beating premier-division opposition is one thing, but dealing with
Steaua is another and Rangers' supporters should forget the pre-season
tournament at Ibrox in which Rangers beat the Romanian champions 4-0.
It will, as Smith and his captain, Richard Gough, point out, be a
different match entirely. ''Steaua are a very good side and the game
against them will begin to provide the answers to all the questions we
want to ask of ourselves,'' said Gough.
''We are now heading into a period of about a month which will tell us
everything about ourselves as individuals and as a team. In fact, this
month could lay the foundations for the rest of the season.''
Gough believes that if Rangers can emerge on top from the games
against Steaua and Borussia in the Champions' League, and two matches,
one in the Coca Cola Cup the other in the premier division, against
Celtic, he and his team-mates would be entitled to take great heart and
believe a productive season lies ahead. ''We have played well so far,
but I think seven of the eight games we have had so far, including the
pre-season tournament, have been at Ibrox,'' Gough added.
''The real tests are about to start now, and they will show us all how
far down the line we are and how far we have still to go.''
Gough, Gordan Petric, and Alan McLaren are operating a three-man back
line and the captain himself has had to adapt more than the two others
because he has been used mainly in a zonal system. ''I am enjoying it
and we seem comfortable, but I don't want to say it is perfect, again
because it has still to be tested at the highest level.''
The Romanians, who beat Rangers in the European Cup in season 1988-89
only to lose 4-0 to AC Milan in the Nou Camp final, dropped their first
point of this season at the weekend when they came back from having been
2-0 down against FC Petrolul Ploiesti for a 2-2 draw. Smith had Steaua
watched in that match and he is certain Rangers face an extremely
difficult time, but he is not travelling in fear of what will happen on
Wednesday even though he has had to leave behind Mark Hateley, Stuart
McCall, and Trevor Steven.
''We are trying to adapt to a different style and we have brought in
some new players who will need some time to settle in, but I think I
have two or three players who can be crucial in that they will help us
all adjust,'' Smith said. ''I always thought Petric would be a plus for
us, and while he settles properly, Gough will help at the back and
Laudrup and Gascoigne can do something with their individual skills.''
The idea in Bucharest will be to retain possession for as long as
possible and Gough is confident Rangers have players who can do that,
pointing out: ''We don't play as flat at the back and we tend to give
the midfield more space to create. We are not as direct, and I'd say we
are playing more football, although this game in Bucharest will not be
about back heels and nutmegs.''
McLaren and Laudrup didn't train yesterday because of slight injuries,
but Smith says both will be fit for tomorrow night.
There must be hopes, too, that any Rangers fans who travel to
Bucharest will behave themselves following reports last night that the
club had been fined #2500 by UEFA after their supporters supposedly had
burned a Greek flag just before the qualifier in Cyprus against
Anorthosis Famagusta in Larnaca.

CHRIS Eubank is likely to outline his initial plans for the future
later in the week. But there will be no change of mind -- it will still
be in boxing. The former WBO super-middleweight champion stressed again
yesterday: ''There is no question of me quitting. I just need direction
and time to get my mind together.''
Eubank could now look to Germany in his quest for more big money to
satisfy his extravagant spending habits, although it threatens to be a
difficult earning exercise coming on the back of two successive
championship losses.

CITY of Glasgow Ragazzi will play both legs of their European
Champions' Cup tie against Norwegians Batsfjord at home next month,
agreeing to split the costs with their opponents and avoid a trip to the
Arctic Circle.
Batsfjord are Norway's most northerly club and it would have taken
Ragazzi the best part of two days to get there for the first-round tie.
The first leg will be played at Glasgow's Kelvin Hall on October 20
with the return at the same venue two days later.

THE fear of easy going has frightened off Portland Handicap winner
Hello Mister from Saturdays's Ayr Gold Cup, the 10-1 joint second
favourite having been taken out of the list of runners yesterday.
''He's been taken out because of the ground,'' said owner Brian
Mitten. ''It is forecast rain and that would not be suitable for him.
Great St Wilfrid Handicap winner Double Blue, a 16-1 chance, was the
other most notable absentee yesterday. However, trainer Mark Johnston
will be represented by Branston Abby, quoted at 5-1 favourite after her
Listed race win at Doncaster last week.
Only 37 of the 138 originally entered for the race were taken out
yesterday. With a safety limit of 29, it is likely that many will miss a
run even in the consolation Silver Cup for those eliminated from the
feature race.
Explaining Double Blue's withdrawal, Johnston said: ''The horse is
fine but we never really thought that it was his kind of race. Besides,
we have got two others, which is more than enough.
''Branston Abby is fine but we are looking for a jockey for
Loveyoumillions. We hoped Jason Weaver could ride him but the weights
don't look like going up and he can't do 8st 2lb.''
There is unlikely to be any raising of the weights at the overnight
stage, as 1993 winner Hard To Figure, who tops the handicap on 9st 10lb,
was described as ''a definite runner'' by a spokeswoman for trainer Ron
Hodges.
Latest betting -- 6-1 Branston Abby, 8-1 Espartero, 10-1 Astrac, 12-1
Top Banana, 14-1 Benzoe, Royal Figurine, 16-1 Actual Fact, Alzianah,
Patto, No Extras, Venture Capitalist, Bold Efort, Cool Jazz, 20-1

IT would have been no great surprise when we arrived at Stark's Park
yesterday to have found the Raith Rovers players crouching behind the
dugout muttering dark curses, most of them involving Ibrox and its
environs. But footballers in the pro game learn from an early age that
yesterday's kick in the teeth can be transformed into today's dazzling
smile.
The 4-0 defeat at Ibrox on Saturday unquestionably stunned the premier
division's new team, and the players, according to manager Jimmy
Nicholl, were very low the following day. Now he and his men have to
restoke the burner for the UEFA Cup first leg against Akranes of Iceland
tonight at their home park.
''I decided that I was not going to destroy them mentally after they
had been destroyed physically by Rangers,'' said Nicholl, ''and the fact
that they were a quiet bunch was evidence enough of how they felt.
''In a way we have to use that to our advantage. If we had got a good
result, even beaten Rangers, they might have been coming in thinking
that there was nothing Akranes could do to hurt them. I told them now we
have to look for something good coming from something bad.''
Psychologists might learn a few things from the management brigade.
Nicholl also has to pick a team, and in that context he is considering
giving himself his first team outing of the season. ''I will certainly
be looking at that as a starter if Jim McInally is not fit enough to
play. We took him off at Ibrox when the game was lost and he has
improved a little from the virus that has been bothering him.
''I'll look at him in the morning and decide then. I need someone to
sit in the middle of the midfield, and if he is not there I might be the
best choice.''
Nicholl was worried when it was suggested that another midfielder,
Danny Lennon, would be counted as a foreign player as he played for
Northern Ireland in a 'B' international. However, he was relieved to
hear that the former Hibs man is an assimilated player in any case and,
therefore, counts as Scottish for UEFA match purposes.
The likelihood then is that, if McInally is out, Nicholl, Julian
Broddle, and Tony Rougier would be the three permitted foreigners. The
manager is inclined to think that some of his players had Europe on
their minds at Ibrox, although this may be an attempt at reassuring
himself rather than the way it was.
''At least we changed things at half-time and kept the score down. At
that point I was worried it was going to be seven or eight,'' said
Nicholl. ''There is no doubt that Akranes are a better team than the
Faroes side we met in the preliminary round. This will be a stiffer
task.'' added Nicholl, the man who last played in Europe with Rangers.
He would like to think the team would get a good start to raise morale
and worry the Icelanders, who have been outstanding in their own league
this season. His own last match is best not considered too closely, a
reserve game against Aberdeen which they lost 8-0 on Thursday. ''I
contributed my share to it.''
He is not a man to let disappointments overtake his overall optimism
and he hopes he has transmitted that to the team. Captain Shaun Dennis,
who has been playing with a recurring disc problem which will be
operated on whenever it surfaces again, believes his mates are
determined to make amends for the embarrassment of the weekend.
''Akranes seem to be a good side so we will have to avoid losing silly
goals like we did at Ibrox,'' said the defender, ''but it will be
important for us to get a win.
''We usually like to kick downhill and put the other team under
pressure as we did against the Faroes side. We are all aware of what
getting through means. Now that we are out of the Coca-Cola Cup, this is
our only chance to get some big football nights.''
The damage to morale is never easy to assess in a team but if they can
avoid any early blunders, Raith might do well enough to keep their hopes
alive for their return in Reykjavik in a fortnight.

GERRY Creaney, the former Celtic striker, and Paul Walsh yesterday
swapped clubs after a week of negotiating between Portsmouth and
Manchester City.
Portsmouth manager Terry Fenwick immediately used the profit on
Creaney's sale to sign West Ham's Martin Allen in a deal that will be
worth #500,000.
The Walsh-Creaney deal was held up over the weekend but Walsh has now
completed a #500,000 transfer back to his old club and is eligible for
today's Division 1 match at Sunderland.
Creaney made the move in the opposite direction in a deal which will
be worth more than #1m once he has fulfilled appearance obligations.
* ROY Aitken, the Abrdeen manager, has promised that his club will
continue to be crowd pleasers and title contenders. The first defeat of
the season by Celtic did nothing to change his plans to transform the
Pittodrie club.
''We are in the entertainment business and I want to bring supporters
through the turnstiles,'' said Aitken. ''My players are geared to
attacking football and will always score goals. But I want to win games
as well.
''I feel for them not taking anything out of the game with Celtic.
However, They must learn how to win games by tightening it up and being
more diligent in their work. I will be speaking to them this week to
eradicate these faults.''
Scotland striker Duncan Shearer will continue his comeback against
Celtic reserves today at Parkhead, while winger Joe Miller, carried off
on Sunday with a leg injury, should be fit to face Hibs this week.
* SPANISH striker Emilio Butragueno was on target for the first time
since leaving Real Madrid to play in Mexico, scoring both goals as
Celaya drew 2-2 with Puebla.

ALEX Ferguson begins his latest European adventure in southern Russia
today convinced that the lessons learned from last year's Champions'
League are the key to success.
Ferguson, who as expected gives Ryan Giggs his first start of the
season away to Rotor Volgograd, knows that United's displays away from
Old Trafford were nothing short of disastrous last term.
''We've got to make sure we're better equipped to handle away games
and that's got to start here,'' said the manager.
Liverpool have been protected by a security blanket after a flight
into the unknown. UEFA Cup opponents Vladikavkaz play only 50 miles from
the border with war-torn Chechnya.
It is a testing background for youngsters Jamie Redknapp and Steve
McManaman as they attempt to build a platform in the first-round tie.
Manager Roy Evans knows that his club must draw from their experience
of more than 150 matches in Europe. Evans is unable to call on the
injured Ian Rush and John Scales, but left Liverpool in a defiant mood.
''We are going there to get the right result,'' said Evans. ''We are
not thinking about the security angle -- we are going there to play
football.''
Leeds, who meet Monaco in a UEFA Cup match, hope to have defender Gary
Kelly and midfielder Carlton Palmer in their line-up. Both were injured
recently but Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson believes they will be ready
for the match in Stade Louis II.

MIDDLESEX produced a one-run victory over Leicestershire at Uxbridge
yesterday to postpone Warwickshire's title party -- and keep their own
Britannic Assurance Championship ambitions alive.
Dermot Reeve's side looked to have a second consecutive title in the
bag after polishing off Derbyshire by 10 wickets at Edgbaston. Now
Warwickshire will enter Thursday's final round of matches with a
15-point lead over Middlesex -- knowing that hosts Kent are unlikely to
do them any favours at Canterbury. If Middlesex win well at Somerset
then Reeve's men will have to produce their fourteenth championship
triumph of the season to retain the title.
Leicestershire were set a target of 251 to win. With nine deliveries
and one wicket remaining, the visitors required only two runs to secure
victory. Alan Mullally, however, swung Tufnell high on the leg side and
John Emburey ran in from deep mid-wicket to take the catch.

ALBION Rovers were last night in transfer talks with Berwick in a bid
to sign keeper Marc Osborne. Manager Jimmy Crease also was negotiating
with former Rangers midfield player Bobby Russell in the hope he would
sign after having been a trialist on Saturday.
If the deals come off both will be included tonight for the Challenge
Cup tie against Brechin. ''I am hopeful and it could be money well
spent,'' said Crease. ''If we get through we could be in line for a tie
against one of the bigger clubs which would bring us in much-needed
cash.''
Hamilton are hoping that history will repeat itself tonight. For the
homeless club want to kick-start their season with another outstanding
Challenge Cup result.
Despite being pointless in the league, Hamilton have knocked out
holders Airdrie. And now they face a trip to Dundee United. ''When I
came here three years ago we had a poor start,'' said Accies manager
Iain Munro. ''But a win against Dumbarton in this competition provided
confidence.''
Crawford Baptie, sent off when Hamilton were beaten at Tannadice, will
be back as will former Celtic player Raymond McStay.
United manager Billy Kirkwood is keen to win the match. ''We are not
treating this game lightly,'' he said. Scott Crabbe and Paddy Connolly
will be given the chance to impress.
Dunfermline should see off Forfar, whose manager, Tommy Campbell,
said: ''We know how good they are, but this is a welcome test for our
side.''
Clydebank meet St Johnstone, while Alloa's fringe players will get
their chance tonight against Stirling Albion following their league
defeat on Saturday.
Stirling will be without suspended Ian McInnes, and manager Kevin
Drinkell pointed out: ''We had to play with 10 men for an hour on
Saturday and that has meant tired legs. I will freshen the side.''
Jimmy Fisher has joined the Stenhousemuir injury list but Adrian
Sproat and Neil Aitken are available to face Montrose.
* TWO goals from Leeds United's Andy Gray helped Scotland to a 4-1 win
in their opening European Championship under-18 tie in Lithuania
yesterday. The other Scottish goals came from Michael Craig and Paul
McShane.
Now the young Scots will meet the host nation tomorrow.

West Ham 1, Chelsea 3
JOHN Spencer was bruised, battered, but happy when he took his leave
of Upton Park last night, the little Scot having scored twice for
Chelsea -- on his twenty-fifth birthday -- in his Premiership success.
Spencer scored in each half as well as earning Chelsea a penalty that
was missed by Dennis Wise.
At one point Spencer was forced to leave the field with blood gushing
from a head wound. But, unfortunately for West Ham, he returned, his
head swathed in bandages, to kill off their hopes of a comeback.
Chelsea were a yard quicker in thought and deed, controlling the game,
apart from a short period in the second half when the Hammers made a
fight of it.
The visitors struck twice in three minutes. Ruud Gullit found Scott
Minto with a long pass. Minto centred for Mark Hughes to head down, and
Wise to force in after 32 minutes.
Three minutes later Spencer was on target, his low shot from 30 yards
beating Ludek Miklosko's despairing dive.
Don Hutchison scored for West Ham after 73 minutes, but Spencer was
not yet finished, and he had a simple tap-in with seconds remaining.
The Scots' performance brought praise from his manager, Glenn Hoddle.
''Little John is a really strong character,'' he said. ''It was a nasty
gash, but I had no worries about him.''
Dundee 3, Cowdenbeath 0
DUNDEE had little difficulty in this Challenge Cup match at Dens Park
last night.
Even before Andy Cargill had scored an eighth-minute opener, the
indications were there that Jim Duffy's hosts were in no mood to allow
the tie to slip out of their command.
The surprise was that it took Dundee until 35 minutes to add to their
lead, Hamilton racing clear and hitting an accurate cross to the far
post for Anderson to nod home.
The home side completed the scoring after 70 minutes -- with major
assistance from their keeper Michel Pageaud. His clearance despatched
Anderson down the left, and when his cross came in, the dangerous George
Shaw was on hand to deflect the ball home from close range.

TRAINER Geoff Lewis missed what he thought would have been a winner
yesterday, through no fault of his own.
Sketchbook was withdrawn from the maiden race at Nottingham after the
horse could not be stabled at the track.
Following a long trip to the track from Epsom, the horsebox containing
Lewis's only runner arrived at the course. But there were no spare
boxes.
''I am disappointed,'' said Lewis. ''I genuinely thought the horse
would win. Here I was with one of the favourites and we have to turn
around and come back home with nothing.''

HOWEVER much a lover of individual sports you may be, there is nothing
that brings out the collective John Bull stiff upper lip more than
picking a group of single-minded, self-motivated players, throwing them
into an alien scenario, e.g. playing for others, and telling them their
country needs them.
The Great Britain and Ireland team that won the Walker Cup at the
weekend was another example, following the many we have now seen from
their professional brothers in the Ryder Cup, of a kind of
Hampden/Wembley mentality overtaking golfers whose usual brief is
looking after No.1.
The BBC cameras which peered through the mist and rain of Porthcawl
captured the astonishing motivation that waving the team flag above a
group of individuals can produce. So many clenched fists, arms raised
aloft, cuddles and trots of delight were spotted that we might have been
at the cup final.
It is such a contrast to the relatively calm, controlled, and
disciplined way of life for the best golfers in the country. Normally,
as the the sport in which they excel demands, they have to try to
contain their emotions. However boiling they are deep within, they have
to maintain an aura of self-discipline, of cool professionalism, and
quite proper respect for opponents.
That respect, happily, seems to be intact but for the odd crackpot,
like American Dottie Mochrie, who made noises in the Solheim Cup which
old Braveheart himself would have deemed excessive.
Jingoism is to be despised but a touch of patriotism does no wrong, as
the home team displayed at Porthcawl, none more so than the Scots. In
Gordon Sherry Scotland has one of these embryo stars who cannot but help
take the limelight, a kind of budding Ally McCoist of the fairways.
The Big G is not a self-seeking publicist, far from it. In fact,
during both the Scottish Open at Carnoustie and the Open itself at St
Andrews, Sherry became weary of the constant attention but succumbed to
it as part of the business, although he became rather adept at it.
However, he is one of these characters who cannot help but find
himself in the thick of the excitement and therefore the attention. His
height, 6ft 8ins, does make him hard to miss, admittedly, but his sheer
exuberance after he had won the first point in the crucial singles at
Porthcawl seemed to dominate the rest of the broadcast.
At the end of the Open he said that everything he did would be to make
make sure he was in the right frame of mind and phsycially ready for the
Walker Cup. He was telling it like it was, was he not?
The man seems to me to be a born leader, an inspirational sportsman
who gets as much fun out of seeing his team win as he does with his own
success.
If he maintains his learning curve and eventually gets his game honed
to the professional consistency he has every chance of being a leader in
the top echelons of the game. He would have made a right good Kilmarnock
centre half after all.
* ALL in all, it has not been a bad time to be born of the tartan. As
well as the exploits of Sherry, Stephen Gallacher, and Graham Rankin in
the Walker Cup, Colin Montgomerie and Sam Torrance had a rare old tussle
in the Lancome Trophy in Paris, with Monty just pipping his rival.
The two are first and second in the Volvo Order of Merit, effectively
the two best on the European Tour, and might well be mainstays in the
Ryder Cup team next week.
When you note that the senior international football team has
virtually qualified for Europe after beating Finland 1-0 last Wednesday,
the same day as the Under-21s trounced the young Finns 5-0, you can see
why it is permissible to have a wee wave of the Saltire. However, make
it quick, there are three major European ties coming up shortly and we
don't want to tempt fate.
Once Rangers have dealt with Steaua Bucharest in the Champions'
League, Celtic have sorted out Batumi in the Cup-winners' Cup, and Raith
Rovers have taught Akranes a thing or two we can haul it out again and
hve another party.

RYDER CUP LATEST
JOSE Maria Olazabal yesterday admitted defeat in his year-long
struggle with a foot injury and withdrew from Europe's team to meet the
United States in the thirty-first Ryder Cup match next week at Oak Hill,
Rochester, New York. As one wild card selection Olazabal could be
replaced by another and the captain, Bernard Gallacher, has opted to
call in Ian Woosnam as the Spaniard's replacement.
Gallacher himself, currently combating a bout of flu, commented:
''Jose Maria had hoped to prove his fitness after he had been picked for
the team, but he acknowledges that his right foot is no better -- if
anything a little worse -- and he was reluctant to be vulnerable as a
team member.''
Woosnam, who is 37, will now play in his seventh successive match
since 1983 at a course to which he has proved he can successfully
respond and of which he should have fond memories, having finished
runner-up there to Curtis Strange -- by coincidence a selection for the
American side -- in the 1989 US Open.
However, as the contest for places reached its climax last month
Woosnam, although he was Europe's leading points scorer in 1993 with
4[1/2] from five games, began to sound querulous and disinterested as to
whether he made the side or not. No doubt his reprieve and the imminent
joining of battle will help him to reconcentrate his mind and take a
more positive attitude.
Gallacher is certainly upbeat about replacing one former Masters
champion with another. ''I'm delighted Ian has agreed to play,'' he
said. ''He has that unique ability to raise his game to meet the big
occasion.'' If so, Woosnam's game, and especially his holing out, will
have to improve no end.
Although Olazabal's golf leading up to the team's formation two weeks
ago was better than Woosnam's, the pronounced limp caused by a growth
between two toes on his right foot was an indication of the constant
discomfort he was in walking between shots. His selection left him
nothing more than a hostage to fortune.
Finally, at last week's Lancome tournament the cumulative effect of
the injury on Olazabal's concentration became evident. Over the first
three rounds, when with five holes to play he was comfortably under par,
Olazabal dropped strokes. If he could not hold his game together over
one round he was less likely still to do so attempting to play two
matches a day.
In four matches since 1987 Olazabal, aged 29, formed an invaluable
partnership with his Spanish compatriot, Severiano Ballesteros. In 15
foursomes and fourball games they won 11 times, halved two, and lost
only twice. They might have been about to be sent to the well once too
often, but their dissolution forces Gallacher to consider other
permutations.

BASKETBALL
FANS will hear today whether their dream trip to London next month to
see the NBA champions, Houston Rockets, is on or off.
It depends on whether Shaquille O'Neill or Michael Jordan wins in the
dispute which has upset the sport in America.
Rockets are due to take part in the McDonald's championship at the
London Arena on October 19, 20, and 21. But if the result of the NBA
players vote, due today, on whether to accept a new labour deal goes
against the players' union, the present lock-out by the owners will
continue.
O'Neill has come out in favour of the deal while Jordan and agent
David Falk are against.
It will be the most exciting line-up of top teams seen in Britain, and
scores of Scottish fans were set to make the trip.
NBA commissioner David Stern has confirmed that the McDonald's Open
will be cancelled if the players vote for decertification of the union.
''We'll have to cancel it straightaway -- it wouldn't be fair to the
sponsors,'' he said.
O'Neill's support may be crucial: ''We owe it to the fans, sponsors,
and ourselves not to lose any of the season,'' he said. ''We must learn
from what happened to baseball.''

PAULINE Robertson, Susan Fraser, Diane Renilson, Rhona Simpson, and
Susan MacDonald have retained their places in the Great Britain squad
for the Olympic qualifying tournament which starts in Cape Town in
November.
The Scots' selection will come as a surprise, as speculation was rife
following the team's recent tour to Australia that, in the light of
Great Britain's poor results, there could have been casualties.
But it may be that a sixth Scottish player, Tracy Robb, also could
make the trip to South Africa with the squad. Hilary Rose, understudy to
first-choice keeper Jo Thompson in the Australian xperience, was injured
and so must now prove her fitness.
Should she fail then Robb is in line for promotion as the Western
player is the only keeper left among the six reserves which also
includes the two English players, Tina Cullen and Lucy Young's, and
Charlotte Merrett, who were the three players rejected after the
Australian venture. The squad is:
J O Thompson, H Rose, J Atkins (capt), A Bennett, K Brown, C Cook, L
Cope, M Davies, T Miller, M Nicholls, and J Sixsmith (all England), S
Fraser, S MacDonald, D Renilson, P Robertson (vice capt) and R Simpson
(all Scotland).

WATSONIANS' committee are about to put the finishing touches to the
commercial deal offered by millionaire businessman John Connor and an
announcement is imminent.
Connor said yesterday that things were ''looking good'' for the
creation of Scotland's first club backed by wealthy outsiders.
He added that even if, as is looking likely, the Scottish clubs agree
to a short-term moratorium on payments to players at club level, then
this would not affect his hoped-for relationship with Watsonians.
''Initially, it is not our intention to pay the players,'' said
Connor. ''Who knows what will happen in the future but at the outset,
our money would be used to market the club and set up a first-rate
public relations system designed to bring the crowds to Myreside.
''There is a lot of PR work to be done if the game is to take off in
the way that many of us hope it will, and in Gavin Hastings, we have the
man on the spot to handle that side of things.''
Connor and a consortium of businessmen plan to pump between
#100,000-#200,000 into Watsonians and, since the World Cup, negotiations
-- unsuccessful as it turned out -- have taken place with Kiwis Sean
Fitzpatrick and Jonah Lomu.
''Depending on how things go, there could be an announcement within a
matter if days,'' added Connor.
* SCOTTISH Ford Dealers have renewed their sponsorship of the Scottish
Rugby Union, and Murrayfield staff plus the union's development officers
are to be re-equipped with new cars.
Dealers' chairman Jackson Carlaw said yesterday: ''Your playing
abilities and good sportsmanship continue to win the hearts and minds of
supporters the world over. Our products are being put to good use,
taking the game into the communities, and helping to develop the pool of
youth talent which is eager to learn rugby skills.''
* SCOTLAND flanker Rob Wainwright, tipped to captain the side
following the retirement of Gavin Hastings, is named as one of the
players of the year in the new edition of the Rothman's Rugby Yearbook.

METEOROLOGICALLY, the east and north-east of Scotland is regarded as
the rain shadow, but Sod's Law was in operation on Thursday when this
column sampled the five-year-old Hawkshill course at Newmachar, eight
miles north of Aberdeen, in what turned out to be the biggest deluge of
the season so far.
The good news, having travelled 170 miles, was that the course was
open. ''Rain like this a couple of years ago would have closed it for a
week,'' said manager George McIntosh, pointing out that much effort has
been made to improve the drainage on this Dave Thomas layout on what was
previously rough grazing, heathland, and bog.
Conditions might have made you think not so much of a swing arc as
Noah's Ark, but Henry Cooper, showing that fighting spirit of old, had
just teed off as the celebrity guest of the Amec company day, and the
pattern had been set.
McIntosh warned: ''It's a tough start. There's a risk of losing balls
at any of the first 18 holes.'' One, indeed, was left behind in the
large water hazard fronting the first green.
The next two offered the chance to appreciate, through gritted teeth,
stands of mature silver birch and Scots pines which attractively define
many of the holes and make the course look as if it has been there much
longer.
Such visits confirmed that the course heavily punishes those who stray
off line. It will become even more penal as the 15,000 new trees that
have been planted grow.
Here, then, is part of the reason why a further 18 holes, also Dave
Thomas-designed, but shorter, flatter, and with less rough, are about to
come on stream, helped by a #240,000 grant from Grampian Enterprise. The
fairways were seeded at the end of last month and the course is expected
to be in play in August.
Around 40 women members have resigned during the club's short history,
mostly because the Hawkshill course is too tough. The new layout will be
less demanding for women, juniors, and, okay, men as well. One measure
is that the present 6605-yard course has a par of 72, but a standard
scratch of 74.
That's not the whole story, though. Already demand from members and
visitors (#20 a round and #30 a day during the week) far outstrips
tee-off times available. There are 555 members paying annual subs of
#325 and a waiting list of 200. The second course, which is planned as a
6300-yard par 72 at its full length, would accommodate the surplus.
There are also some 300 others in categories such as life, junior, and
corporate. The last-named group put up more than #400,000 without which
the project could never have begun, but they bought privileges over a
10-year period, five years of which are still to run during which their
heavy use is generating no further income in green fees.
However, the club have persuaded Gordon District Council to buy the
former farmland for the second course and lease it back in the same way
as they did with the original course, which the club have now bought
outright.
The evolution is far beyond community policeman Charlie Keith's dream
to build his own course in response to the overplayed public courses and
long waiting lists at clubs in the Aberdeen area. Starting with a
meeting in the local village hall in 1979, it has become a rare example
of a successful new private-members' club featuring as it also does a
#350,000 clubhouse and a driving range big enough to contain John Daly.
So modern is the club that women golfers pay the same subs as men and
have equal rights including Saturday medals. They have the tee to
themselves from 1pm to 2pm.
The PGA in Scotland are among those who rate the course highly. As
well as several pro-ams, they have staged the Scottish Assistants'
championship there twice -- on the last occasion Cawder's Alan Tait set
a record 65 -- and discussions have been held with a view to bringing
more prestigious 72-holers there.
Already the club have had a string of successes in regional events.
Members Craig Thomson and Alistair Crombie, moreover, are in the
North-East district team, and 15-year-old one-handicapper Graham Gordon
was winner by 11 shots of the Doug Sanders North-East Boys' championship
this year at Hazlehead.
The course still is short of maturity, notably the greens around which
there is much well-positioned mounding, and every hole has its own
distinctive visual appeal. There is danger, though, at the eighth where,
on the tee, a sign instructs players not to hit intentionally down the
seventh which runs parallel. Presumably if you go there by accident
that's fine.
No such warning is given at the eleventh. Over a mound on the right
and well in range is the unseen second tee, as was personally
discovered. That might have caused a momentous incident. I could have
knocked out Henry Cooper.

WE asked for an explanation and we got it following the photo last
week of six golfers all on the same green at Greenock and an incidental
forefront to the equally rare sight of the passing-by of the QE2.
One of our suggestions, a threeball sixsome, was even nearly right. It
was actually a mixed foursome gone slightly wrong.
This was the last group out and as there was an odd number of couples,
it was sanctioned that six could go out together because it would
against the rules for the last pair to form a oneball twosome.
We have the names of this legitimate grouping. They are: Michael
Bryant and his mother Felicity, George Paton and his wife Margaret, and
the unrelated team of Jack McIlravey and Helen McFarlane.
No, none of them were winners.

IF you strike gold, then things are going well. Many people feel that
two of the best months in Scotland are May (snow on the hills, midges
still relatively dormant and vibrant greenery starting to appear) and
October (cool, clear air without it being desperately cold, lovely
autumn colours and the decline of the dreaded midge).
It is good news, therefore, that the Scottish tourism industry is
getting stuck in about marketing the attractions of the autumn season
and as we all appreciate the gold in our pocket there is a strong,
financial incentive as well.

<HEADLINE>Red tape is at the topof farmers' stress list</HEADLINE>

A SURVEY among farmers visiting the Royal Highland Show and the Royal
Show at Stoneleigh has shown that filling in Government forms comes top
of their stress list.
The dislike of form filling scores equally with bad weather and
''adjusting to new Government regulations and policies'' as a factor
which causes stress.
Farmers approached at both shows were asked to indicate the severity
of the stress factor under various headings on a scale of one to five.
These top-scoring activities each scored 3.3, closely followed by
machinery breakdown at busy times which came in at 3.2, along with
complying with environmental regulations.
The lowest score, at 2.6, was concern about the continuing viability
of the farm. Lack of ready cash was the second-lowest stress factor, at
2.7.
The data was collected on behalf of the Centre of Management in
Agriculture at Edinburgh University, which reported it in its journal.
The TSB's September analysis of the Scottish agricultural industry
suggests that bankers will be comforted by the finding that stress
induced by financial worries features at a level lower than that
reported in other studies.
''This may be due to the time of sampling, with UK agriculture
enjoying high levels of EU support, low interest rates and robust farm
prices,'' the TSB bulletin said. ''There was a significantly higher
level of stress caused by financial factors reported by sheep and cattle
farmers compared to cereal farmers.''
The TSB's agricultural adviser, Donald MacRae, commented that the
survey demonstrated the closeness of the relationship between the
farming industry and politicians. ''On the one hand the Government's
requirements cause the most stress -- but Government support gives most
financial security.''
Among issues ranked as medium stress were unplanned interruptions
(2.6), making major purchases (2.5) and ''few holidays away from the
farm'' (2.5). Financial concerns scored a middle ranking in that section
with debt load and worries about owing money both coming in at 2.4.
The low-stress list was headed by concerns about financing retirement
and worries about keeping the farm in the family (both 2.2). Bottom of
that list were ''not seeing enough people'' (1.7), ''having to travel
long distances'' (1.5) and ''lack of close neighbours'' (1.4).

BRITAIN'S Ware potato crop will be about half-a-million tonnes short
of last year, Potato Marketing Board chairman John Heading has
predicted.
''Yields are extremely variable making accurate output predictions
difficult, but I think a half-a-million tonne shortfall in comparison to
1994 will be about right,'' he said, speaking during an international
potato event at Emmeloord in Holland.
Mr Heading was much clearer, however, in his assessment of Britain's
long-term potato prospects. ''We have made great progress technically
during the past few years and can now claim to lead Europe in seed
potato quality, cultivation and harvesting equipment, and in storage
facilities,'' he said.
''Twenty years ago people travelled to Holland to see the best in
potato production technology; now they come to Britain.''
He was also bullish concerning future trade opportunities, pointing
out that 29,000 tonnes of British potatoes were exported to Holland
during the 1994-95 season and 58,000 tonnes to Spain, compared with 1100
and 12,000 tonnes respectively in 1993-94.
''These increases were weather based, of course, but I believe we can
hold 50% of our extra sales on a long-term basis as the varieties we
have been exporting have shown up well in both Holland and Spain,'' he
said.
''Our technological progress also means that we can now grow potatoes
successfully on land which we couldn't have considered for commercial
planting 10 to 15 years ago. Growers in Holland, meantime, are already
producing to their limit and are using tighter crop rotations than is
common in Britain.''
As if to add weight to Mr Heading's argument, Dutch growers at
Emmeloord were given a sharp reminder that their land resources could
become even tighter in the future.
''Potatoes are the crop which places the heaviest burden on the
environment with a dependence on pesticides and fertilisers which is
still too high,'' said Dutch agriculture minister Jozias Van Aartsen.
''In particular, I am worried about emissions to surface waters. They
will have to be drastically reduced.''
Mr Van Aartsen warned that as a voluntary scheme to introduce
''crop-free margins'' in potato fields to reduce emissions had failed,
his government was preparing to take statutory action.
On a brighter note for Dutch seed potato growers, and visiting
representatives from Scotland's seed industry, a positive sales message
emerged during a seminar on potato developments in the former Eastern
bloc countries.
''During the next 15 years yields will double in the former Eastern
bloc but will be balanced by a halving in production area,'' said Gert
Lodewijk, president of the Dutch Union of Potato Traders.
''This will create a permanent market for our seed potatoes but will
not lead to the massive upsurge in Ware potato competition which some
have predicted. You only have to look at Holland and the UK today to see
that Ware only moves between the two countries when supplies are
unusually short in one or other.
''The former Eastern bloc will be the same in that it will not become
a long-term opportunity for Ware exports but will, equally, not become a
Ware import threat.''

COMMENT
THE price of goods leaving the factory gates rose just 0.2% in August,
taking the percentage change over the year down from July's 4.5% to
4.4%, the first fall in producer price inflation since July 1994.
The core output rate, which excludes food, beverages, tobacco, and
petrol, held steady at 5%, the first time it has not risen for 11
months.
Yesterday, the figures were being widely interpreted as indicating
that the next move in interest rates could be down rather than up
following an unexpected decline in manufacturing output in July. There
was also a sharp fall in the number of retailers reporting higher sales
volumes in the CBI August Distributive Trades Survey.
The Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, is believed to have
considerably softened his stance on interest rates following data
showing that economic growth was slowing.
The probability, though, is that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke will leave
rates well alone for the time being. The official Retail Price Index for
August is due on Thursday and will come under the usual close scrutiny,
while on Wednesday of next week the minutes of the July 27 monetary
meeting between the Governor and the Chancellor will be published. They
also met last week, after which interest rates were left on hold.
Input prices, the amount industry pays for its raw materials, were
also better than expected. The original July figure of a 10.3% increase
has been revised down to 9.6%, while in August there was a further fall
to 8.9%. This was helped by the stronger pound and weaker prices in some
raw materials.
The Treasury described the data as encouraging though one month's
figures in isolation have to be treated with caution. It was clear from
the recent CBI survey that at present manufacturers are still restrained
from passing on their price increases to the customer in the current
highly-competitive climate. But there are fears that any resurgence in
consumer demand would enable prices to be passed on, consequently
stoking up inflation.
As it is, some economists believe that for the Government to hit its
inflation target of an underlying 2.5% year-on-year or below this level
by the spring of 1997, a further rise in base rates will still be
necessary at some stage.
Even the CBI, which last week called for no immediate change in rates
in view of economic uncertainties, had suggested that a half-point rise
to 7.25% in base rates by the year-end should put the Government on
course to hit its inflation target provided there is no significant tax
giveaway to consumers.
There is little sign that consumers have been gearing up their
spending. In fact, almost the reverse if the CBI Distributive Trades
Survey for last month is any guide, though August can be a maverick
month and the particularly hot weather could have had an adverse impact
on the High Street. If the official retail sales figures for the month,
also due on Thursday with the RPI, show the same pattern as the CBI
survey, then this would compound worries among some analysts that the
recovery really is showing signs of faltering.
However, in the past, CBI surveys and official data have often shown
differing experiences. Given the fact that August was an exceptional
month, and retail sales data tends to be a volatile series, perhaps in
this case markets really should be chary of overreacting to a single
month's figures.
The CBI survey did, after all, show that the underlying three-month
trend in sales remains on an upward path. Moreover, retailers expect
sales volumes to have picked up this month.

MAGNUM Power has announced a breakthrough in winning commercial
acceptance for its miniature device that keeps computers going in the
event of power failure, writes ROBERT POWELL.
A leading US manufacturer of power supply equipment has agreed to make
its own products compatible with the Scottish company's Built-In
Uninterruptible Power Supply (BI-UPS) units.
This make it easier for computer manufacturers to offer Magnum's
invention as a standard feature of their products or as an optional
add-on.
Magnum, which is based in Coatbridge, has signed an agreement with
Golden Systems of Simi Valley, California for the supply of BI-UPS
compatible power units to computer manufacturers.
The deal with Golden Systems, a leading supplier of power supply
equipment to the US computer industry, is a welcome boost for Magnum
following recent setbacks.
The company's notoriously volatile shares shot up 20p to 168p in
response.
Magnum originally planned to break into the American market by
supplying a large US retailer with BI-UPS for its electronic tills.
But this fell through, forcing the company to admit in July that it
would not break even until 1996, a year later than planned.
Company secretary Robert Hynd declined to put a sales value on the new
agreement with Golden Systems, but he described it as an important
start.
Magnum is trying to negotiate similar deals with other companies which
make power supply equipment for computers.
The BI-UPS is a card-shaped device which can keep a computer
operational for between 30 minutes and seven hours in the event of power
failure.
It is much smaller and lighter than traditional power back-up systems
and Magnum claims it is also much cheaper.
The company was founded in 1987 and floated on the Stock Exchange in
August last year. It made a pre-tax loss of #2.34m during the 12 months
to May 31.

AEROSOL manufacturers from around the world are converging on Glasgow
this week to discuss ideas and look for new business at an international
exhibition and congress, writes ROBERT POWELL.
The aerosol industry has recovered from a scare over its use of
ozone-depleting CFC gas in the late 1980s and has switched to new and
safer propellants.
Now the industry is bouncing back. The UK squirts its way through a
billion aerosols a year and national demand for aerosol products ranging
from deodorant to oven cleaner, is growing by 11% a year.
''The UK has the highest consumption of aerosols anywhere,'' said Sue
Rogers, the director of the British Aerosol Manufacturers' Association.
''The average UK household will use 34 per year.''
Given the large domestic market, many multinational firms have located
all their European aerosol filling operations in the UK, boosting the
industry still further. Britain produces a quarter of European
production.
The latest growth area for aerosols is body care. There is a booming
market in the UK for shaving gel dispensers and aerosols are becoming
increasingly popular for squirting on perfume and deodorant.
''It comes down to preference and convenience and there isn't anything
else that works as well,'' Ms Rogers said.
The aerosol industry is also expanding worldwide. This is reflected by
the presence of delegations from 43 countries at the September 14-18
Aerosols 95 exhibition of the European Aerosol Federation at the SECC in
Glasgow.
The exhibition, which is held in a European city every four years, has
attracted strong delegations from China, Japan, the United States, and
Eastern Europe as well as from the Western European members of the
federation itself.
Scotland's contribution to the aerosol industry is relatively modest.
Glasgow-based Sanmex International and Barony Universal Products of
Auchinleck, Ayrshire, are the only Scottish exhibitors at this week's
international trade fair.

SHARES in British Polythene Industries yesterday leapt 19p to an
all-time high of 698p, as the City registered its satisfaction with the
Greenock-based company's half-time results.
Pre-tax profits were up 34% at #11.5m and shareholders were rewarded
with a 22% hike in the dividend to 5.5p.
British Polythene has bought 36 businesses in the last eight years and
its acquisitive strategy is certainly proving successful.
The five purchases it made between March and June contributed #223,000
to interim operating profits and #4.51m to turnover.
British Polythene, which is keen to expand further its flexible
packaging and recycling operations, should be announcing more
acquisitions in the near future.
Yesterday's results prompted some analysts to upgrade their profit
forecasts, with a final pre-tax profit figure of about #24m now
expected. This would be an increase of about 26% on the previous year's
#19.1m.
Like-for-like sales were up 45% at #168m, largely reflecting the
company's success in passing on rises in raw material costs to
customers.
Although British Polythene's markets in the agricultural and building
sectors are, on balance, down, executive chairman Cameron McLatchie
emphasised that the group as a whole continued to grow organically, as
well as by acquisition, and he is certain that the stream of
acquisitions will continue during the second half.
Mr McLatchie pointed out that British Polythene now had the largest
market capitalisation, sales and profits of any packaging company in the
west of Scotland.
With the Greenock-based company's share price having risen even more
strongly than that of Glasgow-based Macfarlane Group (Clansman) in
recent months, British Polythene's market capitalisation of nearly #260m
is now slightly ahead of Macfarlane's #250m.
During the first half, British Polythene, which is the biggest
producer of polythene film in Europe, invested #5m in plant and
machinery. The company expects investment in the second half to be three
times this level.
Mr McLatchie said the board believed British Polythene could now
deliver reasonable results throughout the polymer price cycle, and
looked forward to the added benefits which would flow from the company's
ongoing investment programme.

CARADON shares dropped 18p to 203p after the company, whose interests
include Mira showers, Twyfords bathrooms, Everest windows and doors and
security cheque printing, reported a #600,000 drop in interim profits to
#90.2m and warned of a further decline in profitability in the remainder
of the year.
Caradon, like many others, is suffering the effects of sluggish demand
in the construction industry. One of Europe's biggest building materials
groups, it has a high exposure to the housing repair and maintenance
markets and as such it has been hit by the prolonged lack of consumer
confidence in the sector.
Refurbishment is the largest single area of construction and underpins
all other construction activity. In addition, it has been hit by
destocking among its builders' merchants customer base.
Chief executive Peter Jansen said that after a reasonably good first
quarter, market conditions for the building products business
deteriorated. However, the company has been successful in passing on
higher raw material prices to customers, particularly in the UK and the
rest of Europe.
A rapid and unexpected sharp decline in US housebuilding had a severe
impact on the doors and windows businesses.
The company warned that restructuring charges and job losses were
likely. It is, however, operationally very highly geared. In the medium
term, significant recovery potential exists in the group's UK and US
building related markets.
In the meantime, it can draw some comfort from its strong cash flow
and balance sheet.

<HEADLINE>Losses and debt fall but jewellery group still under pressure. Rebels seek Signet revamp</HEADLINE>

REBEL shareholders in Signet called for an immediate capital
restructuring by the jewellery retailer which is labouring under a heavy
debt burden.
Julian Treger, who speaks for the dissident holder of preference
stock, UK Active Value Fund, described Signet's interim results as very
disappointing. They show the usual first-half losses down from #25.9m to
#21.3m and net debt #36m lighter at #343m.
Mr Treger claimed that if the sale of the Salisburys handbag and
fashion accessories chain was taken out then the trading situation had
deteriorated.
''The bottom line is that the company is becalmed and that is probably
a reflection of poor retailing skills,'' he said at the annual meeting
which was held soon after the interim results were published. Signet
chairman James McAdam maintained that the underlying position was little
changed.
Rebel shareholders, who are thought to control 17% or 18% of the
shares, tried unsuccessfully earlier this year to force the company to
break itself up. Mr Treger said yesterday that Preference shareholders
should get the issued value of their shares plus accrued interest,
currently topping #86m, in any capital restructuring.
He indicated that he could muster enough votes to defeat a
restructuring proposal not to his liking. A 75% majority of those voting
is required.
Mr McAdam said the rebels were looking into a ''re-arrangement of the
group's share capital, with or without some form of new equity
participation.'' But it would have to be acceptable to all shareholders
and not unduly favour certain classes.
He told shareholders that the group had not received any sensible
offers for various businesses. He dismissed speculation about the
possible sale of Ernest Jones, saying that the whole of the UK business
was worth more than its parts.
Selling Jones would create a competitor to the H Samuel chain and
erode Signet's substantial share of the UK jewellery market.
First-half UK sales were down 2%, with heavy discounting in the High
Street, but gross margins were maintained. The performance of
refurbished Jones shops is said to be very encouraging and 70% have
received the treatment. Trials for a new Samuel format are under way.
US sales were flat and cost-cutting programme is expected to yield
savings of $28m a year. Mr McAdam pointed out that consumer confidence
in the US and UK remains fragile but it is the all-important Christmas
selling season which will determine the full-year results.
Signet shares eased 1[1/4]p to 14[1/4]p.

THE fur didn't exactly fly when Dalgety bought the Felix catfood brand
in Europe to add to its Arthur's brand last winter, but some analysts
were sceptical about the purchase and the #440m price paid, writes
CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
The cynics' case has been strengthened by news from Dalgety that the
integration costs will be higher than originally envisaged, though the
potential is also said to be better.
The group sees short-term disadvantages in that earnings will be
reduced but the payoff will come through later as it has established
businesses which have leading positions in markets with growth
potential.
Before reorganisation costs of #33.4m, Dalgety's profits were higher
but only by 6% at #127m for the year to June. Petfoods was just 2% up at
#27m, in spite of a contribution from the Quaker Oats European petfoods
business, which introduced Felix to Arthur.
Felix is said to have performed well across Europe, where feeding cats
with canned food rather than kitchen scraps is a growth market. But
their British cousins appear sated as the market is static. However,
Felix improved UK market share from 21% to 23%.
The canned dogfood market, where Dalgety's main brand is Prime,
declined.
The sale of Pot Noodle has pulled gearing back to 42% but only after
Dalgety put the #150m value ascribed to the Felix brand into the balance
sheet.
The impending sale of Golden Wonder crisps and snacks and Homepride
flour and cooking sauces will bring in about #300m. Rather unfortunately
these businesses appear to be thriving, with underlying profits up 12%
at #21.3m.
Pigs deserve a pat on the back as a strong performance by Dalgety's
pig breeding company helped its agriculture sector to a 23% gain in
profits at #42.4m.
As the group warned, the rights issue to finance the Felix purchase
depressed earnings per share, which fell by 8.5% to 33.2p. Yet dividends
are raised by 9% to 22p after a final of 13.5p.
Despite this the shares fell 12p to 460p, not helped when S G Strauss
Turnbull joined the Dalgety doubters by issuing a ''sell'' note.

ALISTAIR Mowat is leaving the board of Scottish &amp; Newcastle to make
way for a reorganisation of its international beer division following
the group's #425m takeover of Courage, writes ROBERT POWELL.
An S&amp;N spokesman said Mr Mowat, 56, would leave the board on September
30, relinquishing his post as head of the international beer division.
It had been felt appropriate to bring in a new team to integrate the
rapidly-expanding overseas operations of S&amp;N and Courage, he added.
Mr Mowat joined S&amp;N in 1964 after three years with Unilever. He worked
in several departments, including personnel and marketing, before
joining the board as an executive director in 1982.
Chief executive Brian Stewart will assume Mr Mowat's responsibilities
for international beer sales.
The main thrust of S&amp;N's export drive has traditionally been North
America, where Newcastle Brown Ale has done particularly well. However,
Courage's exports are mainly focussed on Continental Europe, where it
holds the marketing franchise for Foster's lager.
The integration of Courage into S&amp;N is unlikely to lead to further
boardroom changes since the responsibility for all UK beer activities
was hived off to a new subsidiary called Scottish Courage after the
takeover went through last month.
This is chaired by Guy Dickson, who was previously the head of S&amp;N's
beer division.

GEOFF Runcie, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, believes
the city ''has a lot to share with the broader business community'', not
least its experience of reinventing itself.
In view of this, Mr Runcie believes Glasgow would be an ideal location
for the 1998 British Chambers of Commerce annual conference. Aberdeen
was the scene of this year's event.
Yesterday, Mr Runcie personally lodged the bid to stage the conference
with the director-general of British Chambers of Commerce, Ron Taylor,
in London. The theme of the bid -- backed up with a video and detailed
document -- is ''tomorrow is here''.
Mr Runcie said there were certain sectors of the Scottish business
community which failed to grasp the fact that they could not wait until
tomorrow to deal with international competition, but had to tackle it
today.
He added that it was vital trade was developed in international
markets and in the domestic market to take on the international
competition.
The video shows Glasgow as a dynamic and cosmopolitan city, ideally
equipped to stage a major conference on the threshold of a new
millenium. It was recently host to a conference of the Association of
Scottish Chambers of Commerce and a national transport conference
entitled Getting Scotland Moving, during which Scotland was urged to
become more involved in the Government's Private Finance Inititaive.
Mr Runcie firmly believes greater partnership between the private and
public sectors is the way forward if Britain is to fund some of the
national infrastructure projects for which there are insufficient public
funds.
''It's an important tool in the race to keep us competitive,'' he
said. However, he added that there were too many bureaucratic hurdles
for companies wanting to get involved.
Glasgow's chamber is itself keen to look outward and work with
organisations in both the private and public sector. Indeed, its bid to
host the conference is sponsored by 18 different organisations including
Glasgow Development Agency, Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and other
Scottish Chambers of Commerce.
There have been concerns expressed that devolution may drive business
away. Mr Runcie said the business community was ''a little bewildered''
by the talk of constitutional change in the absence of any details. He
said politicians had not yet made detailed commitments so the business
community could not make a coherent response.
Established in 1783, Glasgow's is the oldest chamber in the
English-speaking world. It has 2100 members in all sorts of businesses
employing a total of 150,000 people. It is up against competition from
Manchester, Birmingham, Blackpool, Brighton and Dorset to host the
conference. The winning bid will be announced on Thursday.
If Glasgow is successful it will be one of a number of events
guaranteed to bring people into the city. In 1999, it will be City of
Architecture and Design.

KINGDOM Cheese Company of Cowdenbeath has bought a yoghurt factory at
Kendal in the Lake District with the help of a #1.5m cash injection from
venture capital firm 3i and loans from Clydesdale Bank.
The move will enable Kingdom to expand its production of mozzarella
and soft cheese and diversify into yoghurt.
The company will transfer all soft cheese production to Kendal so its
Fife plant can make more mozzarella for the pizza trade.
The Kendal factory will continue to make Lakeland brand yoghurt, but
cottage cheese, cream cheese and other types of soft cheese will also be
manufactured in a vacant part of the facility.

A barefooted John Linklater talks to light-footed Brian Cox about his
new role as a singing, dancing rogue, which takes him full circle to the
days when the family coal bunker was his stage
SOMETHING is afoot. Actor Brian Cox answers the door and asks you to
take your shoes off. You are standing on terracotta tiles in your sock
soles, admiring this Spanish-style hacienda conversion that has been
extended from the tiny shell of a simple Camden mews property, and
everyone is at it. Cox is barefoot. His sister Betty is in white socks.
Only sister May has received a dispensation. She is wearing trainers.
''I think it's ridiculous,'' confides May, wise to Brian's ploys since
he was a three-year-old and she was into her teens back in the days when
they were growing up as a big Catholic family in a Dundee tenement. Are
we protecting his fancy new floor? Is it another of Brian's Zen things?
Are they expecting a flood? Much giggling and shaking of heads.
Maybe, in fact, I have got the answer here to the question I arrived
with. What was all this about reviews during the summer that said Brian
Cox, heavyweight classical actor, was light on his feet? Here he was,
sunk in a pile of enormous cushions on the floor, flaunting them. ''The
Barefoot Contessa,'' digs Betty. His feet are remarkably white.
Put them in a pair of two-tone brogues, with loud checks plus chutzpah
and on stage he becomes the capering figure of ''Professor'' Harold
Hill, conman, huckster and redeemable rogue in the Open Air Theatre
production of The Music Man which has packed up its 76 trombones from
Regent's Park to bring River City to Edinburgh's Festival Theatre for a
week. Cox is coming back as a song and dance man.
''He's just come full circle, because that's all he ever did as a wee
boy,'' says Betty. It was the coal bunker and his mother's expensive
curtains. He was always performing on that impromptu stage. He used to
take over the driver's microphone on special bus outings. There were
Brian's ''wee turns'' when he would reprise scenes he had seen at the
''pictures''. Al Jolson, a speciality. And always there would be family
sing-songs. Big audiences, too. When they all got together there would
be over a hundred when you took in a dozen uncles and aunts, and all the
cousins. ''A good grounding for him,'' says May, his first ''manager''.
The sisters have seen his Harold Hill. ''Brilliant,'' says May. ''It
was entirely different from his Shakespeare. He looked as though he was
enjoying it.'' Does she mean for a change? ''Most fat people are quite
light on their feet,'' adds Betty, thinking about that review. Brian
insists she should make that ''stocky''. He has lost two stones for the
role.
Fortunately for him, the sisters' taxi arrives to take them to the
station, but they'll be back for the show in Edinburgh this week. So,
little chance for Brian Cox to rest on his laurels. ''It's just great to
do something that's entirely different,'' he says. ''As Betty says, it
was full circle for me. I wanted to do something with entertainment
value, and not just a heavy message. Something also that makes people
say, 'I didn't know you could do that'.''
The only musical Cox has ever done was Pilgrim years ago, and he quit
when they wanted to adapt it into a rock version. His training, in the
1960s, was slanted towards social realism. Saturday Night And Sunday
Morning, and not much time left for any weekend spirit of fun.
''When I was a young actor, musicals weren't fashionable, so I was
part of a generation that missed out,'' Cox reflects. ''Nobody ever
thought of me in relation to musicals. They thought of me as dour.
Social realism and then the classical theatre. So this whole Irish side
of me that you see in my sisters and the family, never found expression.
In a way, The Music Man is much truer to me in spirit than Ibsen's The
Master Builder, and it's a lot truer to why I started in this
business.''
The chance came when he started directing rehearsals for Richard III
for Open Air Theatre. He had been taking singing lessons with Ian Adam,
who coached Michael Crawford for Phantom, and the company's further plan
for The Music Man in Regents Park was an attractive proposition. He
offered himself, did an audition with a newly reconditioned tenor that
is more familiar in the great Shakespearean monologues and television
narrations and voice-overs than singing Till There Was You. He was in.
''You're putting your voice through more hoops than you would with
King Lear,'' he says. ''With King Lear you know where you're set on a
speaking pattern. Here you're dealing with speaking, singing, and
speak-singing. You're flipping around asking your voice to do
acrobatics.'' Not just light on his feet, then. Light on his repertoire
of vocal technique. ''I'm only learning,'' he insists. He is a bit of a
belter, they tell him, and he has to husband his voice.
''I'm not a dancer,'' he admits. ''I can't dance to save myself. But I
can move. I keep it as delicate as I can. Have you ever seen Cagney's
musicals? He rests, comes to a stop and settles, so the whole
performance flows.''
Cox uses what he can from Cagney, the former hoofer turned screen
gangster, and from Burt Lancaster, the former circus catcher turned
preacher/salesman in Elmer Gantry. ''Lancaster had to understand rhythm
because he started in the circus as the guy hanging upside down who
caught the other performers as they fell. It was pure flow. Cagney
started out as a little Irish tap dancer, a show boy. They both belong
to that brilliant American tradition that understands the relationship
from Vaudeville to straight.''
So, what has all this to do with our both sitting with our shoes off?
''Well, we just wanted this house to be quiet and relaxed,'' says Cox.
''I just wanted that softer feeling of rounded lines and arches and
putting your feet up at the fire.'' He shows me round the rest of the
house, the rest-room outside for meditation, his office with a portrait
of Fulton McKay -- ''My faither'' -- the larchwood cupboard sculpted
into white plaster outside the duplex bedroom and a kiva fireplace in
the corner. Elegant and homely.
The house took a year to build, but Cox and partner Siri Neal were so
much on the road last year, both acting in The Master Builder, that they
never got the chance to spend time here. Siri is going to be in America
for two months, having landed Juliet and Lady Macbeth in touring
productions. It's an occupational hazard, but Cox at least has landed on
his feet, domestically speaking. ''Now I'm in the park, and I'm able to
enjoy home,'' Cox says. That's the secret of light feet. It's being able
to put them up at home for a change.
* The Music Man, at Festival Theatre, Edinburgh today (Tuesday) until
Saturday.

Sara Villiers meets enthusiastic youngsters starting out on the road
to stardom through new drama ventures
IDLY leafing through the pages of The Stage, Glasgow drama teacher
Jenny Ogston's attention was caught by a feature on Stagecoach, a
performing arts course for youngsters which was set up by London actress
Melanie Manuel.
Fed up after years of ferrying her stage-mad kids around various
singing, acting, and dancing classes, Manuel, with business partner
David Sprigg, set up an all-encompassing course which offered three
hours of professional tuition with rotating classes in drama, dance, and
singing.
The three-in-one format proved a huge success and, from relatively
humble beginnings in 1988, Stagecoach quickly expanded. It's now the
largest part-time stage school in the country, with a busy drama centre
in Walton-on-Thames, direct-managed Saturday morning and after-school
classes across London and, following a decision to franchise last year,
over 60 centres throughout England.
Ogston was impressed by the initiative; when she turned the page and
saw an advertisement offering Stagecoach franchises she immediately
filled the coupon and posted it off. With qualifications from the RSAMD,
Jordanhill, and Glasgow University and many years teaching and directing
experience, including stints with Scottish Opera's Opera for Youth and
Manchester's Mermaid Puppet Company, she had ideal credentials but
reckons the green light she received from Stagecoach had more to do with
the fact that for the past 12 years she has run a business -- a petrol
sta tion, a job she laughingly describes is ''like being in a soap
opera''.
Thus, the first Scottish Stagecoach opened its doors for business on
Saturday morning at Duff Memorial Halls in Busby.
Ogston has recruited an impressive array of tutors, including
Inverness Eden Court Theatre's drama-artist in residence, Kieran
Gillespie, with Moira Paterson teaching singing, and Claire-Ann Hamilton
teaching modern dance. Ogston ''gets to ring the bell'' -- the children,
who are aged six-16, are split into three age-related stages and change
classes to the hour.
Places are limited to 45 to keep the pupil-teacher ratio at a
relatively high 15-to-one. One week into the 15-week course -- the
classes run concurrently with school terms -- there are still 10 places
left. While Stagecoach is renowned in the South, its reputation is
relatively unknown in Scotland -- although so far, Ogston hasn't had to
contend with enquiries about bus timetables.
The cost for the first term is #195, which seems like a hefty sum --
''especially to parents who might be used to paying about a pound an
hour for local dance classes'', admits Ogston -- until you consider the
substance of what's on offer . . . over 45 hours of professional
tuition.
A half-price discount for the second child in a family makes it a more
attractive proposition -- working out at about #9 a child each morning
for Doreen Clayton, whose daughters Louise, 14, and Deborah, 10, have
enrolled. ''I was really impressed by the whole concept, everything from
the prospectus, which was really explanatory, to the tutors; they're
just so full of vigour,'' says Doreen.
''It was brilliant, even better than I thought it would be, they
really kept you on the go,'' reckons Deborah. ''The dancing was
brilliant, you get to choose your own music, like chart music or Disney
songs, but I liked it all.'' Her sister agrees: ''All the teachers are
really nice, great at getting the best out of you. Everyone is so
enthusiastic and I enjoyed it.''
Louise already has her heart set on becoming a stage actress but while
Stagecoach has a national agency which can place talented youngsters in
professional engagements Ogston emphasises that it is intended for
children of all abilities, as instrumental in building self-confidence
and communication skills as offering a grounding in professional
techniques.
''Parents will be invited into classes twice a year to see their
children's progress, but we are not working towards a single
performance. Stagecoach is a training school, not a youth theatre group
and we're not in the business of rehearsing -- that means only some get
the limelight and you end up with bored children,'' says Ogston.
Contrasting the ''let's put on a show'' ethos is what has driven
another Glasgow drama entrepreneur -- 16-year-old Hannah Paling, from
Pollokshields, who has been running Patchwork Drama Group of Children
for the past two years. At 14, frustrated by the lengthy waiting-lists
for local youth theatre groups, she created Patchwork, putting up
adverts locally, recruiting 18 children and staging the resultant
variety show at the Eastwood Theatre in Giffnock.
''There was just such a lack of stuff going on for kids my age,
although at 16 there are more opportunities as you can get involved with
adult groups. I love everything to do with the theatre and I was just so
desperate to be involved that I had to make something happen for
myself.''
She's since put on another three shows; producing, directing,
choreographing and performing in all of them, as well as making the
costumes. She's currently immersed in the final stages of Patchwork's
fifth show, Annie, which runs at the Eastwood Theatre from September
18-21, at 7.30pm. Hoping to embark on a course in Musical Theatre in
London next year, she is anxious that Patchwork will live on and is
appealing for anyone interested in involvement to contact her. No doubt
the persistent allure of the smell of the greasepaint and the roar of
the crowd will ensure that ventures as varied as Stagecoach and
Patchwork will continue to flourish.

ON home turf the Citizens' Theatre company's Festival production of
Friedrich Von Schiller's tragedy, set in the court of Philip II of
Spain, is, incredibly, even more emotionally absorbing. Compared to the
austere splendour of the Royal Lyceum, which was perhaps a more suitable
space for Philip Prowse's grandiose but stark black and gold set, the
Citz mainhouse theatre offers the kind of intimate setting which
heightens the ferocious intensity of the performances.
These are of such conviction and strength that it is almost exhausting
to watch them, so intently do they hold your concentration. To say it is
a demanding play is not to infer that it is a difficult play, it is just
increasingly rare -- and therefore all the more gratifying -- to come
across drama which gets its audience to engage so thoroughly with the
text. The machinations are complex but always completely compulsive.
The tragedy here is quite unrelenting, with Schiller releasing
dramatic devastation in each of the five acts and it is remarkable that
the cast sustain the heightened tension although it is interesting to
note that increased confidence with the script is evinced through a more
pointed unleashing of the humorous flourishes in Robert David
MacDonald's translation.
There is much to enjoy in the acting, from Benedick Bates's capricious
prince, Don Carlos, to Giles Havergal's coolly cruel Philip but most
outstanding is Andrew Woodall as the Marquis of Posa, the free thinker
who embodies Schiller's liberal ideals, and who faces death with a noble
but very humane wistfulness -- ''I have sacrificed a few short evening
hours to save the splendour of a summer's day''. Definitely the
highlight of the theatrical year so far.
* School pupils taking part in workshops based on Don Carlos at the
Citizens' today are submitting their own reviews of the show to The
Herald. The best of them will appear in Arts next week.

VARIETY came back to the King's on Sunday night, but probably not the
sort that the theatre is used to. What the evening lacked in jokes, it
more than made up for in the wide range of musical styles and
disciplines that it offered.
Classical fans undoubtedly got the best deal: the orchestra of
Scottish Opera played throughout the first half, but only managed to
start -- 10 minutes after official kick-off time -- once its members had
rightly shooshed the noisy audience, and once their conductor, Richard
Armstrong, had directed several pleading looks towards the gods.
The applause between movements of Hummel's Trumpet Concerto, performed
by John Wallace, was further proof that not only was I not the only
gala-goer to be a classical ignoramus, but also that I was not the only
one to be enjoying the opportunity to sample the selection of classical
titbits on offer.
The selection ranged from the overture to Beethoven's Fidelio to
Scottish composer James MacMillan's compelling They Saw The Stone Had
Been Rolled Away, played by members of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra,
and conducted by MacMillan himself.
Another of the highlights was a sneak preview of Scottish Ballet's
Haydn Pieces, a witty piece accompanied by three piano sonatas and
choreographed by Mark Baldwin.
As ever, jazz was relegated to last place; although it might have been
a case of saving the best for last. Tenor saxophonist Tommy Smith and
keyboards man Steve Hamilton performed Smith's
specially-written-for-the-occasion Artistic Freedom -- a haunting,
introspective and utterly magical number based on a Korean folk song.

* IN football management parlance, Peebles-born Harry Thompson is the
comedy backroom-boy who's done great, he's given 110%, and he's invented
Have I Got News For You, chaired by Angus Deayton. Playing to the final
whistle, Thompson is also involved in They Think It's All Over, a
six-part BBC1 comedy quiz kicking off on Thursday night with sport, as
opposed to politics, at its core.
The two shows are deliberately different, says Thompson, whose
producer skills have also shaped Harry Enfield and Chums and The Mary
Whitehouse Experience. ''Have I Got News For You is unaffectionate and
has a moral agenda, whereas They Think It's All Over is affectionate,
sillier, jollier, with no points to make,'' he says.
There are, however, points at stake. Two teams, led by English
cricket's erstwhile golden boy, David Gower, and English football's
saintly striker, Gary Lineker, will do battle by donning blindfolds and
identifying top sportsmen by touch alone, or making comic remarks about
famous goalmouth misses. Mirthmakers Rory McGrath and Lee Hurst provide
assistance; Nick Hancock referees.
Writing was Thompson's entree into radio and TV. Having graduated from
Oxford into the dole queue, Harry decided to employ his history degree.
''I wrote The Man In The Iron Mask as a serious archival detective
story. It took me four years, and led to two biographical commissions:
of Tintin and Private Eye co-founder Richard Ingrams.''
Thompson next moved to Radio 4's News Quiz, finding himself Ingrams'
boss. He began writing TV sketches in partnership with Private Eye's
current editor, Ian Hislop, and his forthcoming biography is of the
organ's inestimable owner, Peter Cook.
In his spare time Thompson enjoys playing cricket, very badly. Peter
Cook would approve wholeheartedly.

WATCHING this RSC production so soon after the Edinburgh Festival I
couldn't help noticing how similar is the journey taken by Lanark in
Alasdair Gray's novel to that of Peer Gynt in Ibsen's play.
It's a long, unwieldy dramatic poem (all the more poetic in
Christopher Fry's lyrical and ironic translation) in which Gynt travels
from youth to old age through a series of improbable and dreamlike
encounters.
Like Lanark, Gynt himself is less a character, more a vehicle for
existential doubt -- his wild flights of fantasy, his entrepreneurial
ventures, his transient relationships with other people, beset by a fear
that he has not been true to himself, that he has failed to achieve his
potential, that he is guilty of some terrible sin.
These self-doubts reflect our own insecurities and keep us engaged
even as the plot sprawls waywardly across its epic path. Certainly this
is the case in John Barton's refreshingly simple in-the-round staging,
which brings not just clarity but emotional weight to the tale.
In the title role Alex Jennings plays a game of two halves.
In act one, transposed to a rural Irish setting he is the young Gynt
full of child-like wonder and playful amusement at his own tall tales.
By act two, in an entertaining shift that suggests a journey even longer
than Ibsen envisaged, he is reinvented as Peter Gynt, an
English-accented colonialist, explorer, and exploiter, shooting the wild
life and abusing the locals.
It's a rich, endearing, and unshowy performance which, backed up by a
strong chorus of actors and a bouncy musical score, half-English plain
song, half-Germanic folk, opens up an illuminating line through a
difficult play.

''LOOK at me, I'm dancing!'' Perfect feel-good froth for the fifties,
this most popular of musicals might have been, but Salad Days still
lights up the heart and sets the toes a-tapping.
And in a time when dancing has taken on a political significance, at
least the beat of the repetitive variety, the story of a magic piano
which incurs the wrath of the Minister for Pleasure and Pastimes by
causing all who hear it to dance, even has its own modern parallels.
Not that such an agenda is apparent in Ned Sherrin's faithfully
authentic production.
This is a straightforward fortieth anniversary tour which will appeal
to all who hanker after good, old-fashioned gaiety.
The almost, but not quite, lewd Egyptian arms dance, the saucy songs
and outrageous fashion show are faithful to a time of innocence.
Simon Connolly and Nicola Fulljames are perfectly naive as the bright
young things who find Minnie the piano and fall in love while causing
all of London to dance.
However, while Fulljames has has a purity of voice which reaches,
without becoming grating, Connolly does not have enough vocal power for
his role.
But any lack of vitality is more than made up for by Kit
Hesketh-Harvey, who leaps out in an increasingly bizarre series of
characters. It is a gentle humour but he poses, preens, and flatters to
great comedic effect.
This might be pure corn and none is more corny than Gary Fairhall as
policeman Boots, but this is a gentle night out which will cause no
offence. Except during the creaky changes of scenery which, unlike the
production, has passed its salad days.

Male brutality lands hundreds of women in hospital each year. Jean
West asks what sort of system allows such a vicious circle to continue
The health service does not have a strategy, the only thing it has are
Scottish Office adverts on television
A SILENT conspiracy has been gathering apace behind the drawn screens
of Scotland's accident and emergency departments. Women, often nursing
the most spectacular injuries -- black eyes, broken ribs, internal
bleeding, miscarriages -- are drifting in and out of hospital, and in
again, no questions asked.
Treatment is routinely provided for a variety of conditions associated
with abuse, but the abuse itself goes undetected. Professionals are
still inadvertently colluding with the perpetrators and prevention
strategies are not coming into play.
Some NHS trusts in Scotland would say they have established guidelines
to treat these patients. In practice they are rarely used. No national
system exists.
American researchers Cosgrove and Fullin explain the effects of this
kind of negligence: ''Just as when the police officer fails to show up
when called, the clergyman who advises a woman to go home and pray, the
doctor who gently patches up injuries but avoids asking who inflicted
them, all are co-operating with the abusive man.
''He learns that there are no consequences to his actions -- even his
violent actions. He can beat up 'his woman' if he wants to and get away
with it.''
Estimates suggest that severe violence occurs in as many as one in 100
marriages and between one and three and one in five will witness some
kind of violence.
In a study of violent incidents reported to police in Edinburgh and
Glasgow, one-third were cases involving family members. Three quarters
of these involved men assaulting their wives.
Susan Hart of Edinburgh District Council's Zero Tolerance campaign,
which tackles this kind of abuse, said: ''It makes financial sense for
the health service to take this seriously. The cost of each admission
and working days lost through injury is huge. A report in London showed
8% of women experiencing violence had to stay in hospital overnight and
20% had to take time off work,'' Hart said.
The Home Affairs Committee Report on Domestic Violence 1993 concurred.
''In our view, the drain on public funds of domestic violence is so
great that it would be a false economy not to spend money in tackling
the problem from its roots.''
Despite this understanding, little recognition has been given to the
problem in health care professionals' training or medical literature.
Research shows the health service is often the first port of call for
desperate victims. They are more likely than non-victims to suffer
persistent poor health, chronic pain, depressions, addictions, problem
pregnancies, and to attempt suicide.
It should also be said, however, this does not reflect the whole
problem. Many sufferers still nurse their own wounds, too frightened to
seek help. But the tangible relentless nature of assaults, which weakens
both mind and body, is being largely ignored.
Bowker and Maurer, in a non-random sample of 1000 abused women, found
batterings were common and severe, with 46% reporting 20 or more
beatings and 56% reporting being raped by their partners as well as
abused.
American studies show men who abuse women are likely to do the same to
their children.
Psychological repercussions are, not surprisingly, common. Some 85% of
acute admissions to psychiatric hospitals are women who have experienced
domestic violence.
Staff at the Western Glasgow Hospital University NHS Trust are among
the first to make a comprehensive study of abuse and its far-reaching
consequences.
Siobhan Hair, of the city's department of public health, said: ''The
A&amp;E department study into women presenting themselves to the health
service is in recognition that domestic violence has implications for
its work.
''Work in the United States shows it is possible to improve practice
through these means. As far as I know no-one else has addressed this
problem in Scotland,'' said Hair.
The Hidden Figure, a London survey conducted by Jayne Mooney in 1993,
suggested women will report domestic violence to their GPs as often as
to the police (22%).
When a trained domestic violence counsellor was introduced to a GPs'
practice in Leeds as a pilot project, there was a 300% increase in
diagnosis. The GPs also reported their own awareness had been heightened
by the presence of the counsellor and the good practice guidelines.
Helva Groucher, Leeds equality adviser for the health service, said:
''Leeds health service is contributing to an interagency approach to
help lift domestic violence on the health agenda. If we could identify
the problem early on it would contribute to better health for women,
reduce further risk to their safety, and cut hospital admissions.''
Ignorance and indifference are not the only obstacles to detection.
The cunning of perpetrators, who often accompany their partners, can
dupe professionals.
One woman, who took part in a North London study, said: ''The staff
never thought to ask him to wait outside. When I went down to the
casualty, he would say I fell down the stairs . . . he would be there
when I was going to get X-rayed and my head stitched.''
Gail Williamson, in her thesis Domestic Violence and the Health
Service, points out that a survey of nurses in an Edinburgh hospital
revealed two-thirds had worked with victims of domestic violence. But
only 14% felt they had sufficient knowledge to deal with the problem
effectively.
Even though the hospital management stated that staff were adequately
trained in this area, fewer than one in 10 nurses said they thought they
had been.
Williamson said that although some political parties had been drawing
up strategies in certain fields to address domestic violence, the health
service was not a priority.
''At the level of the trust hospital, the management has ignored the
issue, and the recent health reforms do not look set to challenge this,
as although the power structure in the health sector has been altered,
the gender balance in decision-making remains the same,'' she explained.
A spokeswoman for Edinburgh Royal Infirmary said: ''Women often come
into our A&amp;E department and don't say they have been battered. If they
do say they have been beaten by their husband or partner, and are
looking for help, we refer them to Women's Aid. Someone from there would
then collect them but the department must never know where they are
taken.''
The Royal College of Nursing has acknowledged a need to educate its
members on the subject.
Alex McMann, service development manager with the Scottish RCN Board,
said: ''The health service in Scotland does not have a strategy, the
only thing it has are Scottish Office adverts on television. That's as
far as it goes. The RCN is now trying to formulate some policy,
something concrete. We see it as a potential threat to women, children,
families. Repeatedly in A&amp;E women will come in with black eyes,
fractured bones, telling us they just fell again. You start to wonder
why a 25-year-old has so many injuries. A pattern develops. The constant
threat to the person's life is the big worry.''
He added: ''It's a delicate issue. A lot of women are frightened
because of risks to themselves or their kids. Specialist training is
needed.'' The ethical implications of dismissing domestic violence
symptoms as mere accidental injury are far-reaching for the sufferer. By
not diagnosing abuse and reporting it to the relevant authorities, it is
most likely to continue to escalate.
Women are being repaired for another round in the ring, prepared for a
possible serious or life-threatening injury.
Treating the wound and not the cause minimises it, and the
prescription of certain treatments, for example tranquillisers or pain
killers, can be potentially dangerous for the suicidal. Inability to
find help often gives victims the message that they are trapped -- there
is no escape. No wonder campaigners are asking for a lifeline.

IT WOULD be true to say that my family consider me to be somewhat
obsessive about tidiness, especially in the house. You will gather that
they don't totally share my views on the acceptable level of discarded
toys, clothes, little bits of paper and so on which seem to grow on
every horizontal surface in every room. Even the unoccupied ones.
Recently we have seen the rise of the leave-dirty-clothes-on-the-floor
movement, which assumes that the household's Widow Twanky (me) has
nothing better to do than guess where the dirty washing may be lurking
today. Perhaps they're cleverer than that, they know that given time the
dirty washing will come looking for me.
The story isn't ended once I've tracked the washing down. I've then
got to sort it all out. Finding everything inside out is old hat.
My son sets a different trap; he finds pockets I don't know exist and
fills them with all sorts of stuff unlikely to improve the wash. I'm
used to crisp packets -- with crisps -- bits of paper, the odd coin.
Post-holiday we've seen shells, sizable bits of seashore, and even a
crab's claw. Nothing still alive -- yet. It's when I hear odd jingling
or chuntering noises from the washing machine I know I lost to a
six-year-old.
Tidiness around the house also involves in large measure a continuous
war against paper. So much for computers ridding us of the need to chop
down trees; they just let more people know our name and address so they
can send us rubbish in the form of adverts and fliers.
These are often attractively designed, with pretty pictures -- so the
children hang on to them for ''making things''. Once so transformed,
often with some imagination, it's unfair to toss out these works of art
without a decent interval -- a couple of weeks, say. So we live in a
sort of evolving sea of cuttings, monsters, castles, and robots. Glue
sticks and scissors find their way into the most unlikely places. As
''put the cap on'' might just as well be said in Japanese to our lot, we
end up with an assortment of glued together but otherwise totally
unrelated items.
I know I have the Battle of Bedrooms to come -- and I know who will
win, and it isn't me. So far our children are too young to ban us from
their rooms, so we still have some control over how many building bricks
we wade through to say goodnight, and whether wall-to-wall cuddly toys
are really a good idea.
I even get to clear up the bricks myself occasionally, when the
children are at school, and they still haven't worked out that it is
neither of them who has made the masterpiece -- and left the rest strewn
across the floor. It's a bit of the ''Do as I say, not as I do'', but I
did mean to clear it up, really . . .

DOROTHY ROWE'S GUIDE TO LIFE, #14.99 hardback,
pp September 4, HarperCollins.
IT may sound heavy going but this is actually a fun book. Anything
that starts off with ''the secret of life is that there is no secret''
could never be a pontificating lecture. The author is apparently
world-renowned for her work on how we communicate and why we suffer, and
if this is a typical example of her work I'm not surprised.
Death, depression, emotion, and truth are all given the same
no-nonsense treatment, and the reader is aimed firmly at a hopeful
future. Rowe sums up her guide with a choice. You can exist. Or you can
live.
BABY IT'S YOU, Annette Karmiloff-Smith, #9.99 paperback, pp August 3,
Ebury Press.
THIS book is based on the Channel 4 series of the same name and
documents the first three years of a baby's development. It is a
fascinating read, and not only for doting parents, as babies are
described with the same detachment applied to any other little animals.
The paradox in this is that the author sets out to identify all the
characteristics which define us as human beings and so distinguish us
from the rest of the animal world.
The human baby is normally portrayed as a cute, helpless little mite
with interests only in food, play, and sleep. Karmiloff-Smith dismisses
these adult preconceptions and centres instead on the hard work involved
in the first two years, when a child absorbs more information than at
any other time of their life.
Diaries kept by parents illustrate this, as they focus on
developmental milestones which might otherwise go unnoticed. Walking
upright, using tools, conversing, thinking, and interacting socially are
all skills which transform helpless infants into constantly developing
human beings. Looking at life from a baby's point of view provides a
totally different angle from traditional child-rearing practices.
Worth a look before the TV series is repeated this autumn on Channel
4.
LONERS -- THE LIFE PATH OF UNUSUAL CHILDREN, Sula Wolff, #13.99
paperback, #40 hardback. Published August 17 by Routledge.
WE like children to conform and fit in with their peers. Loners make
us uncomfortable and we worry for their future. Wolff's study of a group
of maladjusted children through school into adult life is an
investigation into the Loner Syndrome, with recommendations for
treatment and education.
Clinical recognition of the condition is the author's aim, and she
warns against confusing it with other disorders such as autism. This
could hinder rather than help sufferers as child loners do not
necessarily become adult loners. They could be gifted, have special
interests or unusual fantasy lives, and forcing them into group
activities causes great unhappiness. Shunning the company of others may
not be classic social behaviour, but loners can still lead successful
and productive lives.

AS recessions go, the one Finland endured from 1990 to 1993, which
gouged a gaping 13% hole in output, has left, arguably, a much tougher
legacy of hard choices than those facing post-recession, pre-millennium
Britain.
We have had so much experience of boom and bust in recent decades that
we have almost come to believe it the only possible reality. Such is the
poverty of our current economic imagination that we regard growth rates
much above 3% a year as wildly unsustainable. The Bank of England
underwrites such baleful orthodoxy.
We are finding it equally hard to adjust to the prospect of
permanently low levels of inflation, with everyone from bankers to
homeowners dreaming wistfully of the wonders a little bit of inflation
used to work on anything from bad debt provision to house prices.
And, if we have an industrial strategy, it is to avoid, like the
plague, any taint of the Maastricht social chapter and, as a result, woo
footloose inward investment by offering it a lower cost option than our
cosseted, minimum-waged European Union neighbours. For Finland -- one of
our newest partners in that Union, the fifth-largest country in western
Europe, but with a population the size of Scotland's, and like Scotland
located on Europe's periphery -- economic aspirations have,
traditionally, been at odds with Britain's approach.
The Finnish economy will grow by 5% this year while inflation is
currently little more than 1%. Most Finns still subscribe to the Nordic
version of the inclusive welfare society. The words state enterprise are
not regarded as some quaint, unworkable contradiction in terms.
Consensus, even in politics, is regarded as a virtue. And high taxes are
the acceptable and accepted price of that welfare society. Or, rather,
they have been up till now. But as I discovered for myself over the past
week, Finnish confidence has been deeply disturbed by the shock of their
economic bubble bursting. How Finns, in Helsinki and in the provinces,
react to the new challenges facing them, will help determine whether the
British approach or the higher aspirations/higher expectation model
pursued, with varying emphases, by the Germans, the Finns, and the
Swedes will prevail in the longer term.
Where we, in Britain, have long since become inured to escalating base
levels of official joblessness -- from one million in the late 1970s, to
1.7 million in the late eighties, to well over two million now -- the
Finns can scarcely believe that their unemployment rate -- a stable 5%
or so throughout the seventies and eighties -- rocketed to more than 18%
in the four years to 1994 and is not now expected to drop below 10%
before the end of the century. That stark fact is testing the
long-standing Finnish consensus belief in a well-funded comprehensive
state welfare system, which means high levels of personal taxation but
delivers, as of right, a quality of services and personal support
increasingly assigned to market forces in post-Thatcher Britain.
Finnish state debt has soared to help pay for the unprecedented
numbers of unemployed. In Finland, if you lose an established job, you
are currently entitled to unemployment benefit of roughly two-thirds of
salary for the first 500 days. And, if you then work for six months of a
municipally-inspired scheme, you are entitled to another 500 days, on
the same generous terms.
Add a banking crisis which siphoned off some #6000m in state rescue
subsidies and it isn't hard to see why government debt in Finland
climbed from 10% of GDP to 57% during the recession. Getting that debt
ratio down, keeping inflation low, and tackling structural unemployment
are the three key tasks facing Finland's new coalition government which,
incidentally, spans the social democratic and communist left to the
conservative right.
The early omens are mixed. Five per cent growth this year looks even
more impressive when you recall that the political upheaval in the
Soviet Union cost Finland, for a time, markets which used to account for
nearly a quarter of total exports. Thanks to a 40% surge in
competitiveness and the export-led success of major indigenous
companies, like the telecommunications group Nokia, three more years of
5%-a-year growth -- the Finance Ministry's optimal scenario -- looks
just about plausible.
Although peripheral, Finland stands at an enviable geographic position
in the Baltic as gateway between the capitalist West and the emerging,
industrialising former communist East. Unlike the Swedes, Finns remain
as positive about European Union membership as they were in their
referendum before joining. The Finnish Government is at the front of the
queue of those eager to join a single European currency.
But, behind that kind of ebullience, the impact of mass unemployment
is troubling politicians and people alike. While I was there over the
past week, annual pay talks with the trade unions were deadlocked, not
because the unions were being greedy but because they wanted savings
made from their acceptance of a 2% deal used to reverse small cuts the
government is proposing to make in welfare benefits for the unemployed.
In a country where opinion surveys perversely show nearly as big a
majority for radical reform of the welfare system as for keeping it as
it is, the traditional consensus approach appears to be deserting Finns
just where they need it most. Many privately admit that their welfare
system was never designed to deal with mass unemployment. The danger now
is that, even if new jobs are created, the incentives available not to
work could prove too tempting to too many.
However, creating the new jobs will not be easy. I asked both a
leading SDP politician and a senior civil servant in the Finance
Ministry where the new work will come from. Both told me it was easier
to say where the jobs will not come from. Manufacturing. Financial
services. Public administration. All will shed labour, I was told or, at
best, create small numbers of extra jobs. New jobs will come from new
small-to-medium companies, working in sectors we've yet to dream of.
It was a familiar response. One I've encountered many times here.
Governments don't create jobs, only the conditions in which new work can
emerge. ''Look at America,'' said the civil servant. ''The O J Simpson
trial has created 40,000 jobs.''

YOUR diatribe against Dounreay, published as a leader column on
September 7, was littered with errors and misrepresentations.I repeat
here some of what was written, along with the actual facts in each case.
'' . . . the nuclear plant which has skewed the local economy (and)
done little to encourage meaningful and diverse industrial
development''. The existence of Dounreay over 40 years has, in fact,
fostered a wide diversity of local businesses , both large and small,
during this period. These have all provided additional employment and
contributed to the North Highlands economy.
'' . . . wrought untold harm to a tourist industry which could have
delivered significant prosperity.'' Tourism levels are higher in
Caithness this year than last, and several thousands of these visitors
called to see the new Dounreay Exhibition Centre during their holiday.
'' . . . nor does the pollution inspectorate, the Dounreay management
. . . have the slightest idea of whether anyone is at risk of coming
into contact with the particles.'' The 13 or so particles which have
been discovered on the enclosed foreshore at Dounreay each year since
1984 represent no risk to the public. This is because the terrain on the
seaward side of the foreshore represents a barrier to the public, and
the site security arrangements prevent access from the landward side.
There are, in addition, prominent warning notices which would prevent
any genuine member of the public from even attempting to gain access to
the foreshore.
Only one particle has even been found on the coast away from the
Dounreay foreshore and that was in 1984. Despite regular monitoring of
local beaches, none has been found since.
A wide body of evidence supports the claim that recent finds of
contamination from the early days do not present a significant hazard to
people on or off the site and this view is supported by independent
bodies.
On one point we would agree with the writer of your leader: Caithness
is ''a dramatic and wonderful place''. Which is why many of us are
pleased to live and work here. Fortunately, due to Dounreay, we have the
opportunity to do so.

THE initiative by Strathclyde police to question householders
concerning the quality of public service it provides is to be welcomed
as a constructive exercise.
A similar pilot venture along the Ayrshire coast earlier this year
brought bobbies back on the beat in Largs and surrounding villages with
a resultant decrease in reported crime.
In this latest survey for which the force recognises a need it is to
be hoped that suggestions from the public are treated with respect.

IN your profile of me (September 9) you reported me as saying that
there was ''no chance of a single currency in 1999''. Since this may be
subject to misinterpretation, I hope you will print this letter in
clarification.
My precise words were that I thought there was ''no chance of a single
currency involving all of the countries of the European Union by 1999''
-- a far more limited and fairly uncontroversial statement.
I then went on to say that since a single currency is almost certain
to come about in steps not all at once, de facto all member states have
an ''opt-out'', and thus the oddity of Britain's position is simply that
we have required the fact of the opt-out option to be explicitly
recognised.
There remains, however, a very significant possibility that some
members will move to a single currency in 1999. Britain will therefore
need to consider carefully whether and when to be part of a single
currency in the light of circumstances as they emerge through time.

LONG gone are the days of F Olbrich's nostalgia when Highers were
intended as a selective test for a small and privileged elite (September
7).
Another misconception is to see Scotvec modules solely as an
alternative for ''those not capable'' of Highers, whereas in some cases
they are supplementary and in other used as stepping stones to Highers
over two years. They are certainly not to become a replacement under an
assumed name.
The drive behind Higher Still, far from diluting university entrance
criteria, is to consolidate traditional standards whilst ensuring that
the performance of all students staying on at school or college after
Standard Grade is measurable in an integrated system, according to
individual abilities, interests, and aspirations.
Consistent progression in the lifelong learning process, including
changes of direction, should be more straightforward.
Providing continued challenge to academically gifted students is
another essential element rather than the current fast-slow pace of S5
and S6, hence the Advanced Higher Option.
What's in a name? It has yet to be decided. Getting the system itself
right is the priority. For that reason a small army of professionals and
volunteers has been co-opted by the Scottish Office to develop,
scrutinise, and criticise the details.
Public consultation must be, and be seen to be, genuine and effective.
That is why as a parent I am involved with one of the task groups and I
hope that other critics will also take a constructive interest.

ON behalf of my radiological colleagues I wish to correct a few
factual inaccuracies in your article, Keyhole to new treatment
(September 4).
HCI was not the first hospital in the country to insert a stent graft.
A stent graft similar to the type described was actually inserted in
Glasgow Royal Infirmary over one year ago.
The suggestion that this keyhole surgery facility was not available
elsewhere in Scotland is nonsense -- many operative procedures involving
the placement of stents in the major blood vessels are performed
regularly by specialist Interventional Radiologists in the major
teaching hospitals in Scotland and elsewhere in the UK.
The NHS in Scotland is quite capable of providing such high technology
treatment, although it is largely confined to the largest centres at
present.

Eric Kennedy discovers that being a wine merchant can be a heady
career
IT'S easy to see why people become wine merchants. All that foreign
travel, basking in the sun with copious glasses of the finest fruits of
the vine.
Ian Cumming confirms that this is the popular image. Then he proceeds
to tell it as it is. ''Try standing in a freezing-cold cellar in the
Loire Valley on a January morning,'' he says, ''tasting some rather
nasty, acidic young wines which won't be fit for drinking for some time.
It's not a lot of fun. And the trade in general entails a lot of
jolly-hard work.''
He doesn't go quite as far as saying he doesn't really know why he
does it. The wine trade is a fine way of earning one's living and of
course it can be rewarding and exciting.
The important thing, says Cumming, is to know the business. ''Too many
wine merchants have gone to the wall in recent years,'' he says. ''It's
not a place for the amateur.''
In his case, knowledge of the trade, of wine making and importing was
built up over a number of years after he left Charterhouse public school
in Surrey and took a foreign students' course at Grenoble University,
learning about the French language and culture.
This led to a job in wine cellars in Burgundy, learning about the
bottling and binning of wines and working in the laboratory. It was here
that he learned how to analyse wines for acidity, tannin and sugar, and
how to treat them as necessary.
On his return to England he worked for a London wine importer, was
taken on as a management trainee by a brewery (for this was the time
when the breweries were starting to become interested in wines), and
returned to the Continent in a battered Morris Minor to tour vineyards
in France, Spain, and Portugal.
This vastly increased his breadth of knowledge of wines, and sherry in
particular, and on his return to Britain he became North of England
representative for one of sherry's big names. He moved on to become
manager of a retailing operation in Wales before becoming the South of
England representative of a large wine importer.
In 1968 he decided to move to Scotland. The ancient wine company of
Whighams was up for sale and Cumming fell in love with his
eighteenth-century cellars in Ayr's Academy Street.
He bought the business and has thoroughly enjoyed his 27 years there
so far, merging last year with England's second-oldest wine merchant,
Corney &amp; Barrow -- holder of three royal warrants and suppliers to the
Houses of Parliament.
His company organises wine tastings, has a wine society for private
customers, and has access to the world's most expensive wines -- Chateau
Petrus, a Bordeaux at anything between #300 and #400 a bottle, and
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, a similarly-priced Burgundy.
It also has many perfectly acceptable wines at only a few pounds a
bottle, and was the first importer to introduce wines from Slovakia.
One way of entering the trade these days is to take a Wine and Spirit
Education Trust course at a college, leading to a basic certificate,
higher certificate, diploma, or Master of Wine qualification. This
facilitates entry to the trade and the rest is good, honest hard work.
Did anyone ever suggest otherwise?

YOUR editorial on British Gas service charges falls into the trap of

systems in a safe and professional manner (September 6). Furthermore,
your suggestion that customers who switch to smaller independent
operators in the field ''will be compromising their own safety'' is not
only wrong but is sensationalism.
Although British Gas may be a major player in the field, they have no
right to a near monopoly position nor is their reputation as solid and
untarnished as you suggest.
For a number of years, members of the Scottish and Northern Ireland
Plumbing Employers' Federation have questioned whether British Gas
charges were a true reflection of the cost of the service provided. The
increases announced therefore come as no particular surprise.
SNIPEF member firms must use properly qualified tradespeople, carry
appropriate levels of public liability insurance cover, and must work in
accordance with our Code of Fair Trading which can deal with any
complaints which may arise. Hardly the mark of a so-called ''cowboy''.
Private contractors will view these increased charges as a welcome
opportunity and customers should not be fooled into thinking that only
British Gas can safely work on their heating systems.
Competition is already in the market-place and local people should
take advantage of the services offered by their local contractors, many
of whom are also able to offer an insurance-backed competitive servicing
agreement.
The sentiment that only British Gas is qualified to work on gas
systems is a myth and customs should wake up to the fact that their own
local contractors can offer them a similar and very competitive service.

THE reason cited by British Gas for putting up the price of
maintenance contracts is increased competition from outside firms. Under
normal circumstances when a company faces intense competition it reduces
prices.
Perhaps someone from British Gas will explain how it expects to gain
more customers and fight off competition by increasing prices.

IN his article on the Dangerous Dogs Act, 1991, George Hume rightly
suggests this appalling piece of legislation was hastily put together as
a reaction to media hysteria over dog attacks (September 8).
A few weeks of devil dog headlines in the tabloid press forced the
then Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, into one of the greatest legislative
blunders of recent times.
One of the first cases I dealt with after the Act came into force
concerned a man who removed the muzzle of his registered and neutered
pit-bull-type dog to allow it to vomit. Had he not done this the dog
would have choked and he would have been guilty of cruelty to the
animal.
As it was he was spotted by a police officer and charged under the
Act. His deed of common sense and compassion earned him a criminal
record and a #250 fine. The court had no option but to put his dog to
death.
Kenneth Baker had a hidden agenda when he introduced the Dangerous
Dogs Act. His swift action killed off moves to introduce a national dog
registration scheme which would have humanely reduced the vast numbers
of unwanted dogs, encouraged caring pet ownership, and allowed the
courts to deal responsibly with dangerous dogs on a case by case basis.
It can only be hoped that a future Government will throw out the
Dangerous Dogs Act and replace it with long overdue legislation which
will offer people protection from genuinely dangerous animals while also
curbing the cruelty and neglect which dogs endure on a massive scale.

GEORGE Birrell's column on the subject of whether an independent
Scotland would have a surplus or deficit of wealth (September 7) misses
the point altogether, which is that the vast majority of Scots have the
desire to have control over their own ability to remedy any deficit or
celebrate any surplus in the wealth of their own country.
Depending on which viewpoint you wish to believe, we are either net
contributors to the union or else ''ungrateful spongers'' who should be
grateful for England's generosity.
What is not in doubt is that we, on the democracy balance sheet at
least, are very definitely net losers and in the red.
Whatever the financial pros and cons of Scotland being independent,
the tone of apology in George Birrell's article makes me cringe. I wish
he and others who frequently defend the Union would stop apologising for
being Scottish.

FEW forms of warfare are as futile in the field, as useful to
beleaguered politicians, or as agreeable to a vengeful public as a
really good campaign of offensive bombing. Over the past couple of
weeks, as millions have settled down to enjoy the steady bombardment of
the Serbians by gallant little Nato, few seem ready to ask if bombing
can actually wring any good from the Balkan bloodbath.
The blitz has stopped, and started, as talks have stopped, and
started. Every so often there is a change in target, with the present
attack focusing on Serbian anti-aircraft defences. This weekend saw the
deployment of cruise missiles, with sly Tomahawks slicing over the
countryside like so many rattlesnakes. The hatreds in the wreck of
Yugoslavia remain as strong as ever. The Serbians remain as belligerent
as ever. The talks, on periodic resumption, appear to accomplish as
little as ever.
Yet, throughout our pleasantly civilised nations of the West, there
spreads smug satisfaction at the thought of Serbian dismay and Serbian
victimhood. So the rockets whoosh on and the planes scream in -- boom,
boom, boom -- and our statesmen feel useful, heroic, and cannily careful
of Western lives.
History, however, does not burst with examples of victories wrought by
bombing. It is, in truth, terrorism on a massive scale; in so far as
aerial bombardment can achieve anything, it is to terrorise a populace
and intimidate their leaders and, with every crater and every bang,
further to weaken national morale. Strategic, surgical, tactical bombing
is a myth.
The notorious missions of Bomber Command to Nazi Germany in the 1940s
killed tens of thousands of civilians (not to mention legions of the
poor bombers themselves), but did not seriously damage Hitler's war
machine, nor greatly shorten the conflict. In 1982, during the Falklands
conflict, much was made of RAF raids on Port Stanley airport. The war
was over before the MoD had to admit that, in fact, repeated raids had
done little more than strip the tarmac off the runway.
In the Gulf war of 1991, the grinding bombardment of Desert Storm was
brightened by lots of clever film shot from the noses of ''smart
bombs''; we were told of bombs that could follow street-maps, bombs that
could turn at 45-degree angles, bombs that could direct blast to any
point of the compass, bombs that could squirt incendiary vapour through
keyholes and vapourise whole bunkers. The barons of the arms industry
gloated, and assorted Third World despots reached for their chequebooks.
This whole corporate video sounded wonderful at the time. In fact, the
strategic bombing of Baghdad and Basra accomplished little. There were
the usual disasters of ''target error'', if that is a fitting
description of razed hospitals and smouldering orphanages.
What did work was the bombing in the desert; a relentless, 24-hour
pounding of Saddam's entrenched, reluctant and largely conscripted Army.
Again, the success was more psychological than physical. Hundreds of
troops simply turned and fled; others, by the time the big push finally
began, were in no mental or physical state seriously to resist. Bombing
is a terror. If that terror is well directed, and if the people under
fire are psychologically vulnerable, then aerial bombardment can be of
some effect.
Conscripts are one thing; civilians quite another. As long as
statesmen keep calm, even the most viciously bombarded populace can be
rallied to new heights of endeavour and hatred against the enemy. What
do you suppose the ''spirit of the Blitz'' was all about? Did Clydebank,
pulverised in 1941, collapse into a whimper of appeasement? Rather, it
was, ''Eh, thae gi'en iz worse than thae gi'en Coventry!'', and the
Clydesiders were more fiercely patriotic than ever.
Politicians of our century like air-to-ground bombing, because it is
highly economic in offensive lives (especially if anti-aircraft systems
on the ground have been flattened to scrap), hugely gratifying to
fireside viewers at home, and has a pleasant air of Armageddon and the
Last Judgment about it. But warfare is a serious business and any
competent general, free of nervous political influence, will tell you
quietly that bombing is, largely, inefficient and unhelpful.
In the Balkans theatre, this Nato bombing campaign appears peculiarly
pointless and silly. What, precisely, is the strategic point of Western
involvement in the Balkans? A war aim should be simple and, in
principle, achievable -- pushing Saddam out of Kuwait, Galtieri out of
the Falklands, Hitler out of existence.
In the Balkans, the issues are, to say the least, diffuse. In sum, we
want the Serbs to be nice sensible folk and to stop killing people.
History affords no evidence, however, that bombing campaigns render a
folk peace-loving and reasonable. Further, even if all the tactical
goals of this bombing project are met -- heavy artillery removed, radar
systems flattened, and so on -- the Serbs will remain in charge of
territory at present held, in command of many ruthless troops on the
ground, and with their peculiarly Balkan viciousness raised to new
heights of vigour and venom. Short of a massive commitment of Western
ground-troops and a full-blown war, what can actually be done to shift
them?
It is also far from obvious why the Serbs are singled out for peculiar
Western opprobrium, save that they are, in the main, more successful and
coherent than their neighbours. Nothing in the whole wretched conflict
has shown them to have a monopoly of horror. Croats, Muslims, and the
rest have alike demonstrated their skills in massacre, torture, rape,
and small-scale genocide.
The brutal truth remains, as I have long insisted, that there is not a
single important strategic issue at stake for the West in the Balkans,
and that there is nothing worthy of the waste of a single Western life.
In Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia thrive hatreds and bloodlusts lost
in the mists of millennia. No faction can be held morally superior to
another. None is guiltless of slaughter and cruelty. None is worthy of
our support or intervention.
To impose peace on the region, we would need a new Hitler, a new
Stalin, a new Tito, and a prolonged aggressive war with the aim of
creating a new, semi-despotic Yugoslavia. It would take years to
accomplish, require the full military involvement of every Nato state,
imperil the security of all Europe, and succeed in suppression of those
ethnic hatreds only by revival of a super-Balkan state with a monopoly
of terror.
Western diplomats and generals should quit their war games, leave the
Balkans to it, and slink back home.

IT says much about Italy's torn nerves that the merchants of Venice
are intent on running the city's cafe musicians out of town. For the
past few seasons the purveyors of fancy goods around the Piazza San
Marco have blamed poor takings on the country's political shambles.
But impotent in the midst of such pervasive crisis, the traders are
now directing their frustration at a more available target: those little
orchestras that serve up a sweet confectionery of Viennese waltzes and
operetta scores to tourists gathered at open-air tables in the square.
''They play so loudly they are ruining my business,'' says Paola
Cazzavillan, a jeweller next to the Cafe Lavena. So incensed is she by
Strauss and Lehar crescendos that she has obtained a court order against
all cafe musicians in the piazza, which gives them seven days to temper
their recitals with some pianissimo, or be gone.
Anyone who knows Italy will realise this fight is not about
dispatching the real culprits of Venetian racket -- those itinerant
rockers with amplified guitars, those pompous brass bands thumping away
so perilously close to caricature, or, indeed, the tone-deaf gondolieri.
No, Cazzavillan and her cronies are after the melancholy violinists who,
by mid-day, are already in their penguin suits, looking as if they've
never made it home from playing at La Fenice the night before. For
generations they have been performing at Lavena, Quadri and Florian, the
piazza's most celebrated cafe.
They come from everywhere, these musicians: some the victims of
orchestra cut-backs around the world, others the lay-offs from
cruise-ship entertainment, and still more, the artist-exiles from
communism's fallen states. Occasionally the standard of playing is
patchy with one virtuoso nimbly gliding over the bum accompaniment of
less accomplished cousins. But the simple pleasure of cafe music is that
it allows us another means of visiting the past. The cafes, meanwhile,
treble their prices but even this does not deter custom. Venice is never
short of foreigners whose thirst compels them to pay a fortune for a
chic al fresco cuppa which, of course, may then be dumped on by a
pigeon.
But given this tradition, why have complaints about the decibel level
of the Merry Widow surfaced only this year? On retailers' urgings Judge
Sara Natto issued her instruction after day-time noise tests revealed
that the piazza music exceeded the 65 decibels limit. ''We play soft,
romantic classics,'' retorts Florian's manager, Roberto Comin, adding
that any unrestrained loudness comes only from applause and laughing
lovers. And this might be the more honest reason for mercantile anger.
''In order to hear one another my customers and I have to shout above
the music,'' says Cazzavillan crossly. But the fact is that tourists
obviously find the expensive sound of music cheaper than Venetian
shopping, and are no longer bothering to browse through pampering
boutiques.
To some extent Venice has always displayed a lack of gallantry to
travelling minstrels. Some years ago a group of exceptionally gifted
young jazz performers from Edinburgh established a pitch not far from
the grand canal. Within hours they had earned so much money that local
buskers complained to the police who promptly expelled them from the
city. But street entertainers anywhere are stoics and it is this sort of
challenge which keeps them on the move. And many will tell you that when
they do have time to win spontaneous audiences the rapport always beats
legitimate concert halls.
In Moscow at the metro station near Arbat Street rush-hour commuters
jolt to a standstill to form an attentive semi-circle around a Mozart
string quartet. Dollar notes, rather than roubles, flutter into a violin
case, and seeing the hard currency two hovering militia men decide not
to break up the gathering, probably concluding that their tolerance
demands a cut. In London, Paris, or New York -- all cities where
complaints about noise are on the increase -- it is not the man with the
flugelhorn whom careworn silencers are out to ambush. Neither is it that
vagrant flamenco dancer who fills pedestrian walkways with clattering
heels and castanets.
The rumpus of street theatre is as old as time itself and those
determined to muzzle it are usually killjoys propelled by devious
self-interest. So, what Signora Cazzavillan may have ringing in her ears
is not music but handclaps for some commercial venture more engaging
than her own.

WE rest easier in our beds knowing that the education of our bairns is
in good hands. A copy of the minutes of the senior management team at
Uddingston Grammar School, in one of the less dark parts of Lanarkshire,
finds its way to our desk.
There is a lot of stuff in the minutes about SVS, TVEI, and ISEP about
which we will not detain you since we do not know what the SMT (senior
management team) are talking about in these connections.
We did understand, however, the last item on the agenda, which reads:
''Alton Towers Visit -- Mr Kilpatrick proposed that a group of teachers
should be allowed to visit Alton Towers with a group of senior pupils on
Inset Day 2. The purpose of this visit would be to devise guidelines for
future school trips to Alton Towers and similar visits. This was
considered acceptable.''
An Inset day, for the uninitiated, is an in-service day -- a day when
teachers don't have to take classes but work on extra-curricular matters
of great importance. Like taking the weans on the waltzers at Alton
Towers.
Coining it in
STILL in the world of education we hear of a teacher who was given the
task of looking after the sweetie machine newly installed as a
fund-raising initiative in an academy somewhere in the North-east. The
dominie had to replenish the change in the machine and, being unaware of
the correct procedure, was observed by pupils loading a large quantity
of coins through the money slot. Having created a large credit on the
luminous display, he left possibly happy with a job well done. On his
departure, the pupils, slightly more aware of the mysteries of
technology, indulged in a feeding frenzy.
Heartbreaking
YOU can always rely on the Evening Standard, the newspaper known for
its anti-Scottish bias, to show its ignorance of anything outside
London. Their coverage of the film Braveheart refers to Mel Gibson as
''Scottish freedom fighter Walter Wallace''.
* Spotted outside the MGM cinema in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, a
chap with a decided Cockney accent trying to sell The Big Issue to the
audience who have just had their anti-English prejudices well and truly
fired up by watching Braveheart.
Fruit of Scotland
A SAD but true story from a tattoo parlour from Norman Miller of
Rutherglen who has connections in this particular industry. It concerns
a Scottish chap who decided to have a wee skin decoration while on
holiday in Kerala, India.
He requested a tattoo of a thistle with the word Scotland below it.
The Indian tattooist was keen but confused as to exactly what was
required.
The Scot eventually did a drawing of what he wanted and the work
proceeded. The result was not very much to the customer's satisfaction.
The tattooist had looked at the drawing, checked it with his own
reference book, and executed an absolutely perfect pineapple with the
word Scotland entwined around the bottom.
Singing the blues
DUNFERMLINE is a very historic toun as can be seen by the district
council's appointment of a Master of Song for the town's abbey. Great to
see the old traditions upheld and that the remuneration, as noted in the
council minutes, is an annual payment of #100 Scots. Very Scottish --
and very cheap since #100 Scots is only just over #8 in ordinary money.
Close calls
OUR research into the world of the pub quiz has revealed that this
intellectual pursuit brings out the very worst in people. We hear from
Eric Dunn of Brodick that even some of the good folk of Arran have been
cheating.
The quiz in question takes place in the Ormidale Hotel under the aegis
of patron Tommy Gilmour. He eschews the use of namby-pamby technology
such as microphones and perambulates the three public areas of the hotel
repeating the questions as often as the competitors feel necessary.
This has resulted in some teams resorting to the mobile telephone to
contact relatives who had an expertise in certain subjects. They were
prepared to do so despite the fact that the cost of the telephone calls
far exceeded the value of the prize -- one measly free drink for each
member of the winning team.
Richard Mills of Bellahouston, Glasgow, reports some very organised
sleight of hand in a quiz in an unnamed public house. The trick was to
enter two teams, one of which he describes as ''the dummy team''.
The idea is that the dummy team submit early their sheet, filled with
wrong answers, and ask the quiz-master to put them out of their misery
as to their ignorance of the answer. The correct answers are quickly
transmitted to the real team to fill any gaps in their sheet.
Mr Mills adds: ''Diaries, newspapers, dictionaries, and old, drunk
people are also quite useful sources, although the latter cannot always
be relied upon. The Encyclopaedia Britannica is also quite handy but a
bit tricky to hide under the table.''
Both Mr Dunn and Mr Mills receive a copy of the book How to Win Any
Pub Quiz (Guinness Publishing, #7.99) the better to pursue their
cheating at these social events. We have more copies of the book to hand
out in return for secrets of the pub quiz. And there will be a bottle of
Glengoyne 10-year-old malt for the best, most outrageous piece of
nefarious conduct at a pub quiz.

YOU might think that a golf course in a Scottish setting beyond the
dreams of even Hollywood, coupled with a world-class design sufficient
to attract the patronage of the rich and famous, would bring inevitable
success in the tough, competitive world of the golf.
But with many new courses currently struggling to survive and players
becoming more knowledgable and discriminating about the game and the
courses, it takes something special to get the formula right.
Ken Siems, whose job it is to ensure the greens at the 18-hole Loch
Lomond Golf Club a few miles north of Glasgow are in pristine condition,
believes he is well on the way to achieving that. But he's not there
yet.
Appointed earlier this year as golf course superintendent and directly
responsible to its American developer Lyle Anderson, he manages the
lochside grounds and is responsible for training and educating staff. He
also purchases capital equipment and oversees the course maintenance
programme set up by course designer and former Open champion, Tom
Weiskopf.
Although the greens look almost perfect to the untrained eye, Ken
says: ''The course is not yet in good condition. It will maybe take
another two years. This is a difficult place to grow quality grass.
Drainage is the biggest problem because it rains a lot and you don't
have control of growth-limiting factors like temperature and light.
''From a maintenance standpoint, however, it is a pretty good course.
It is fairly open with no bottlenecks so it's easy to move the equipment
around. We spend a lot of time on training, using the facilities at the
Scottish colleges that have greenkeeping programmes.''
These include Elmwood College in Fife and Oatridge College in Lothian.
Both are approved by the training committee of the British and
International Golf Greenkeepers Association (BIGGA) to offer full and
part-time training at craft, supervisory and management levels. Langside
College in Glasgow is approved to offer part-time training and Kyle and
Carrick District Council in Ayr is approved to offer training to craft
level only.
So, basic training can be had on home ground, but it is Ken's
international background and training that serve him well because of the
huge scope of the work of a modern greenkeeper. Although a Canadian, he
was trained in America at Pennsylvania State University, graduating in
turfgrass management. He is recognised by the industry as one of the
leading turfgrass specialists in Europe, having developed his expertise
working at Augusta National during a period that included the 1983 and
1984 Masters, serving as head superintendent at Islington Golf Club,
Toronto, and then at the 36-hole East Sussex National Golf Club, home of
the European Open.
He says: ''I am more of a businessman now than a greenkeeper and I
wish I had done a business degree first. I still have a lot to learn --
better accounting techniques, better ways to present proposals. But I'm
happy to be in Britain. It has brought me balance. I have the best of
both worlds. I enjoy working with nature but also with business.''
He was tempted to Scotland, he says, because of the beauty and design
of the Loch Lomond course and because of Lyle Anderson's reputation for
working well with environmentalists and planners. ''I don't think there
is a prettier course in the world,'' he adds.
''It has natural beauty -- the mountains and the loch, and colour --
the trees, flowers, bushes and shrubs. Strategically, it is also a
well-designed course which tests every club. That is important to the
golfer. And there are no unfair shots. I also wanted to work for a
world-class project.''
At Loch Lomond he supervises a broad-based international team of 20
which includes people from Britain, Spain and Iceland. He says: ''Things
are changing so much right now. The biggest issues are environmental
ones. To succeed at this job, you have to be a conservationist, a
chemist, a biologist, a mathematician, a good communicator and a
businessman.''
Ken explains: ''You have to understand soil science and how
fertilisers and pesticides affect soils and you need to understand the
biology of the turfgrass plant so you can plan your programmes.
''However, about 85% of my time is spent in the office keeping control
of budgets, forecasting, ordering materials and writing reports, and I
have to liaise with the staff and with the developer. Working for a
developer, who is an entrepreneur, is different from working for a club.
The budget is usually handed to the greenkeepers and they work within it
but I start from nothing and have to justify every penny.''
Ken, 33, is helped by assistant superintendent Mike Wattam who has
also worked at the East Sussex National Golf Club. Ken says: ''He is my
right-hand man, the eyes and ears of the golf course. He manages the
crew and the mowing programmes. The greens are cut every day and because
of the unpredictability of the weather, we write dry day and wet day
programmes each night. There are also water features and a wildlife
sanctuary to look after, together with a tree health-care programme.''
Most of all, he stresses the importance of training and educating a
team which is adaptable in a constantly changing and increasingly
computerised industry: ''I have many different computer programmes. For
example, the irrigation systems can be totally run from a PC in my
office. But these programmes can be overused and I can't justify that.
People are the most important thing. Computers, however, can be used to
tackle problems. I can link up to international universities and use
their resources for research.''
Behind all the technique and knowledge and research, however, the job
is singularly about golf. And, therefore, a labour of love. Designer Tom
Weiskopf has said that Loch Lomond is the best course he has built. He
said at the time: ''I love being back here. My Open win gave me what I
have and I'll never forget that. Golf in Britain is not a pastime, it's
a way of life.''
It is within that spirit that Ken Siems and his team work.

Dick Louden reports on the swing towards the Scots in schools and an
accompanying heightened sense of national identity
It's hauf like a bird and hauf like a bogle
And juist stands in the sun there and bouks.
It's a wunder its heid disna burst
The way it's aye raxin its chouks.
HUGH MacDiarmid's well-loved poem The Bubblyjock is about to soar
further in popularity thanks to an upsurge in interest in the Scots
language at school level. This can be traced back to 1991, when the
Scottish Office Education Department first published its 5-14 national
guidelines.
Suddenly a language whose use in schools had been actively discouraged
for a century received the official stamp of approval. ''The first tasks
of schools are to enable pupils to be confident and creative in this
language,'' the guidelines stated, going on to assert that ''Scottish
writing and writing about Scotland should permeate the curriculum and be
introduced from an early stage, taking its place beside English
literature''.
Stuart McHardy, director of the Scots Language Resource Centre in
Perth, is understandably gratified at this recognition. He points to the
beneficial outcome -- a number of small publishing houses are now
issuing material in Scots ''aimed aither directly at schools or at
bairns in general''.
The Scottish Children's Press in Aberdeen has released four titles
over the last few months and has many others in the pipeline including,
says Stuart McHardy with the self-effacing modesty of the true Scot, The
Wild Haggis an the Greetin-faced Nyaff, by one S. McHardy''. Derek
Rodger of Argyll Publishing in Glendaruel, Argyll is producing a series
of Scots legends in the native tongue, the first being William Wallace,
A Scots Life by Glenn Telfer, just published to coincide with the
release of the film Braveheart.
Now comes the latest publication designed for schools, Doadie's
Boadie, which claims to be ''jist whit workers at the chalkface have
tellt us they need -- an want!'' Doadie's Boadie, which can be purchased
at #8 including postage and packing from the Perth resource centre, is a
60-page resource pack on the teaching of the human anatomy with
acetates, flash cards, poetry and a short story (all in Scots).
A major contributor to Doadie's Boadie was Liz Niven, Scots language
development officer in Dumfries and Galloway, where Scots is the
everyday language of many pupils. She feels that the resurgence of Scots
at school level arises not only from the status accorded to it by the
5-14 guidelines but also because there is now ''a heightened awareness
of Scottish identity''.
She has put together a regional pack, issued to all 132 schools in
Dumfries and Galloway, which includes Scots literature past and present,
booklists, four tapes of local people reading in Scots and a wealth of
ideas for classroom presentation. Also available is a book called Solway
Stills, reworked from a 1970s publication Galloway Gallimaufry, which
contains a collection of literature about the local area.
Also lending fresh impetus to the development of Scots in schools is
the newly established Merlin Press based in Scone, Perthshire. Its
founder, Dr Sheila Douglas, is an experienced teacher, writer, folk
singer and broadcaster who is now to be language tutor on the new degree
courses in Scottish music at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama. She has just completed an introductory 5-14 package for schools
consisting of a teachers' starter pack and 20 Scotsheets, which have
been very favourably received by teachers in regions where piloting has
taken place. The pack is accompanied by a cassette tape containing all
the word lists, poems, songs and stories.
The teacher pack provides a rationale for the use of the Scots
language; a list of Scots words and their usage (for example, blate --
shy, pauchle -- swindle, smeddum -- spirit); a guide to Scots writing
(dialect and slang, spelling and the apostrophe barrier -- no
apostrophes must be inserted in place of letters supposedly missed out
for example walkin NOT walkin'); a guide to Scots storytelling;
vocabulary connections between Scots and foreign words (bairn -- Danish,
barn; besom -- Dutch, bezem); plus a bibliography of Scots song books
from Allan Ramsey's The Teatable Miscellany (1724) onwards.
The Scotsheets, which are not meant to be ready-made lesson sheets but
raw material for teachers to work with in introducing Scots to the 5-14
curriculum, offer vocabulary, usage, suggestions for activities and
projects and a range of enjoyable rhymes, poems, stories and songs:
Jenny's jist a wee lass, wi a wee pony-tail,
Hir hauns an feets are totie, hir neb's as smaa's a nail.
But Jenny can dae aathing, she's as brainy as she's braw,
An she has sic a kin hairt, she's loed by ane an aa.
Next year this upsurge in the Scots language will achieve an even
sharper focus. 1996 is the bicentenary of the death of Robert Burns and
a host of celebratory events will be organised across the country.
Another important landmark will be the publication of a new bilingual
dictionary by the Scottish National Dictionary Association.
For schools there will be another major event with the publication in
January by the Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum of The
Kist, a special resource to assist schools in the promotion of Scots and
Gaelic across the 5-14 curriculum. Containing 160 pages of poetry, prose
and drama, The Kist will represent all the main dialects of Scots and
there will be glossaries of difficult words, plus some Gaelic texts with
translations.
Backed up by a teacher's pack consisting of a handbook, audio tapes
and extensive teacher's notes, including sheets of pupil assignments and
guidance on assessment, The Kist will be the natural culmination of all
the recent publishing activity designed to enhance the use of the Scots
language in our schools. In the words of Stuart McHardy, ''that canna be
bad ava''.

John Hodgart makes an impassioned plea for linguistic diversity in our
clasrooms and culture
'HERE's tae us -- wha's like us?'' Gey few it wid seem, judgin bi the
attitude o maist Scots tae their mither tungs.
Shairly ane o the weirdest contradictions o Scottish culture is that
while we're often fond o crawin aboot oor mony claims tae fame, we often
hae nae mair confidence than wee coorin timorous tung-tied beasties when
it comes tae expressin oorsels in oor ain native Lowland Scots. We pey
respectfu homage tae oor great national Bard aince a year, but for the
rest o the time leuk doun oor snoots at onybody that actually tries tae
yaise the very tung that Burns immortalised. In maist Scottish schuils,
the annual Burns' Competition has been the only time o year when ony
kinna Scots wis tholed.
Thus the paradox o oor independent Scottish educational system that we
are sae prood o, a system that has played a major pairt in pitten doun
the native tungs o Scotland an inflictin nearhaun fatal damage tae oor
ability tae express oorsels in Scots wi ony real confidence. Sadly we
are socially an educationally conditioned tae accept that there's only
ane ''correct'' way for educatit folk tae speak an write, an it
certainly isnae in oor mither tungs.
An imperialistic mono-lingualism o ''correct'' English has aye ruled
in oor schuils an in the past it wis enforced bi a muckle dod o
Lochgelly leather, an instrument pairtly uised tae enforce a linguistic
reign o terror, mainly against workin class weans that couldnae or
widnae conform tae their middle class teachers' concept o ''educatit''
speech.
Yet in spite o aw the educational an social prejudices tryin tae kill
aff Scots, it thrawnly refuses tae wither awa, for its roots are teuch
an deep, as maist Scots continue yaisin it in some form, or at least
unnerstaun it, whether in oor ain local dialects or in a maist
distinctive variety o Standard English, nou referred tae as Standard
Scots English. An even mair hopefu sign is that a lot o folk are nou
waukenin up tae the fact that tryin tae develop oor weans' confidence in
English bi rootin oot their local dialect is actually linguistically
counter-productive, educationally hermfu, culturally destructive, an is
in fact a form o racism that shoud be tolerated nae langer.
It wid seem that Scottish education is mibbie beginnin tae realise
that in being bi-lingual, we actually hae a great cultural asset,
through bein able tae express oorsels in equal confidence in baith Scots
and English. However that can only happen if oor mither tungs are gien
equal respect in oor schuils alangside Scots Standard English. Nae
greater pruif o a linguistic revolution in official thinkin is the fact
that it is noo official policy tae encourage Scots an Gaelic in oor
schuils, fae 5-14 through tae the new Highers.
However, guid intentions need pittin intae practice an we hae tae ask
whit we really need in the short term bi wey o teacher-support, an in
the langer term teacher-trainin, tae mak this kinna policy a reality at
the chalk-face? Clearly it has tae be supportit bi adequate in-service,
furstly for primary an ''English'' teachers but eventually for aw
teachers, in aw subjects.
We hae tae stert somewhaur an nae doot the first thing we'll still
need tae dae is convince mony teachers o the educational advantages o a
positive policy towards Scots. While there is nae doot that mony
teachers, especially teachers o ither subjects in saicondary schuil,
badly need tae develop a faur greater degree o linguistic awareness than
their ain education has providit, primary or English teachers shoudnae
think that, tae cope wi some form o bi-dialectism, they necessarily need
a mair sophisticatit level o linguistic skill an knowledge than maist
already hae. Aw that language teachers really need is a guid grasp o the
concepts o linguistic diversity an flexibility, a reasonable familiarity
wi the features o the local dialect, an how it differs fae the standard
variety, as weill as an ability tae teach weans how tae yaise a variety
o different language registers in speech an writin. No aw that faur awa
shairly fae whit mony are already attemptin?
In the langer term tho, we hae tae leuk at teacher trainin an ask if
we can really gae on acceptin it as the norm that maist teachers learn
virtually nuthin at college aboot ane o the maist vital aspects of
teachin, the nature o language, an especially their pupils' language,
while plenty o ''English'' teachers still enter Scottish classrooms
withoot haein studied ony Scottish literature or language.
Shairly it shoud be an essential pairt o aw teachers' training that
they shoud dae a short course on linguistic variety an diversity in
Scottish culture, while it shoud be obligatory for primary an saicondary
English teachers tae hae duin at least a basic university course on
Scottish literature an language, an possibly tae hae duin a short course
on actually yaisin the language, tae improve their bi-lingual
confidence. While a teacher's education disnae end at the college, it
wid certainly mak them a lot better qualified tae teach the subject, an
hopefully a lot mair enthusiastic aboot it.
The Scottish Office has giein us a clear statement o the richt o Scots
tae an important place in the curriculum an spellt oot that teachers hae
a duty tae develop an unnerstaunin an appreciation o its literature
amang their pupils. Thus folk in posts o senior management at regional
an local level hae a public responsibility tae see that this is in fact
bein taen seriously, an no jist left tae enthusiastic individuals
guddlin awa on their ain. Indeed, schuils an teachers that fail tae
ensure that oor ain culture has a key role in the curriculum are no only
failin tae implement their employer's policy, but are failin in their
duty as Scottish teachers.
If we really are serious aboot defendin oor diverse cultural identity,
an mibbie tryin tae cure oor perverse cultural cringe, we need tae mak
siccar that aw weans lea the schuil literate in their ain native tungs
as weill as oor ain distinctive form o standard English.

WILLIAM Russell is right to dismiss the film Braveheart as historical
rubbish. It is basically a star-studded adventure film in the genre of
Carry On up the Khyber.
It is amusing and full of action but to link it with William Wallace
is going a bit too far. Some of my pupils were especially critical of
the historical accuracy of Braveheart; their view was shared by the
regulars of the Wallace Cave in Lanark.
Many writers did not consider historical accuracy terribly important,
but it is, considering the role William Wallace played in the
independence struggle. It is only through an examination of the history
of this period that we can understand what made Scotland a nation.

SINCE Dumfries and Galloway has so many Scots speakers, it is perhaps
not surprising that it is the first region to have appointed a full-time
Scots language development officer. Liz Niven has held the post for four
years on secondment and in that time her influence has spread across
schools in the area.
She previously taught at Douglas Ewart High in Newton Stewart, where
the use of the Scots language in the classroom is, not unnaturally,
blossoming. Head teacher James Judge is supportive of the development,
which is being vigorously taken forward by Gillian Barclay, principal
teacher of English, and her department.
''I see it as part and parcel of my everyday job to encourage this,''
she said. ''The pupils must be made to feel valued when they use their
own spoken language. Some pupils still have the perception that there is
something wrong with speaking in their own voice -- they use separate
playground and classroom voices. However, now they're gaining confidence
and relaxing. They have strong opinions about the Scots language and
they are starting to express them.''
It takes time. ''Some children still feel they have to be given
permission by teachers to use their playground voice,'' Gillian Barclay
explained. ''Things are moving, though. The English department all use
Scots and have done for years. It varies across departments and there's
no school policy yet because developments like this have to happen in
their own time.''
She will be happy when youngsters stop talking about speaking
''properly''. ''If you ask them what they mean by 'proper', they say
'polite','' she said. If they want to try writing in Scots, she
encourages them to go ahead, especially if they see it as enriching
their message. ''Some are not so comfortable with the written word and
we don't press them,'' she added. ''Others show real creativity as they
experiment with, and enjoy, their own language.''
Her second-year class had few inhibitions. Emma Barlow, who moved from
Newcastle at the age of eight and has not shed her Geordie accent, had
to ask her new friends to translate at the beginning -- now she speaks
more Scots than English. Derek McCutcheon said: ''A've lived in Creetown
aw ma life. Maist o the fowk speak like this. A've thrie wee brithers --
they aw tak like me.''
Linzi Brown from Whithorn said: ''Awbodie in Whithorn taks like this.
So should ither fowk that come here.''
Ryan Murray summed up his home village succinctly -- ''Creebridge is
jist a street fou o foggeys. When a speak a feel awkward, bit ithers
have nae problem understaunin me. A think awbodie should ken oor
language a wee bit mair.''
At Park Primary in Stranraer, where Liz Niven's husband John is head
teacher, the Scots language is common currency. The school serves a
deprived area and John Niven sees the use of Scots as ''one aspect of
our ethos-building approach''. He regards it as a vital part of
encouraging the youngsters to communicate and build up trust. ''Some of
our staff are more accustomed to the 'correct' approach,'' he said,
''but we have discussed it and we are agreed that we must not stifle
communication''.
Sheila McConnell, who teaches primary seven, is a convert to the
cause. She said: ''My parents drummed it into me that I must speak
'proper'. Until recently I discouraged my pupils from speaking Scots. It
was Mrs Niven who persuaded me. Now I use it myself in class. I do it to
encourage them.''
One of her pupils, Tammie Balfour, thought that, if you speak Scots,
''yi jist soun different. No better or worse, jist different. Some o ma
mum's friens don't speak like me an she asks me no tae speak like this
when they're visiting.''
June Carrie was less confident. ''A taped masel tae see how a soun
when a'm singin,'' she explained. ''It sounded stupid. A want tae tak
like Glesca fowk. Or the Americans -- they tak cool.''
Tommy Crosbie said: ''Aw ma family tak the same as me but ma grannie
was brought up tae speak English very correct -- like 'yes', no 'ay'.
Still, A like the way a speak.''
So did Michael Hamilton, who was born in Dumfries. ''Fowk tak
different there,'' he said. ''Oor next door neighbour shouts at us when
we hop ower her fence. Wan time she chased us wi a brush. We nick
rhubarb fae oor friens tae. A like oor language -- English is too
posh.''

Geraldine Abrahams learns about the changing interface of a global
hotel group which empowers its staff and is fuelling moves in Scotland
BEFORE the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988 and the City of Culture
celebrations in 1990, it would have been unthinkable for anyone to
suggest that Glasgow could possibly sustain more than one or two large
city-centre hotels.
In 1995, it has become accepted that hotels will open and they will
thrive, providing a growing number of jobs for people and equipping them
with the kind of service-based skills that will take them safely into
the next century without fear of obsolescence.
On Monday December 4, Glasgow's latest hotel, the Holiday Inn Garden
Court, will open its doors at the top of West Nile Street in the heart
of what its promotional material refers to as Theatreland, providing a
welcome after-theatre drink or meal venue.
So far, it has created around 200 jobs during the construction period,
with everyone from the architects, designers, main contractors,
electricians, plumbers, computer programmers to the carpet layers all
working to bring the building to fruition eight weeks ahead of its
original schedule.
When the hotel actually opens, it will employ around 100 people in a
wide variety of roles, in areas like management, housekeeping,
reception, in the restaurants, bars and kitchens, as well as various
maintenance and computer/technology-based jobs.
Owner Maurice Taylor is well known in the Scottish hotel business, and
general manager Tony Wright has worked with Holiday Inn, the franchisor,
for 12 years. Between them they have a combination of skills and that,
together with Maurice's idealism and Tony's pragmatism should ensure the
hotel's success.
While Maurice will search the flea markets of Paris to re-create his
successful La Bonne Auberge restaurant in the hotel, heralding what he
hopes is a new era of pavement cafe society in Glasgow, Tony will be
re-introducing Holiday Inn concepts to Glasgow.
With state of the art technology, this hotel will be part of the
worldwide network of 2000 hotels with around 500,000 bedrooms. Holiday
Inn's registration office in Amsterdam has set a 1995 target of one
million bed nights.
Garden Court will be one of the 99.9% of hotels in the mid-scale
market. Holiday Inn tries to fit the scaling from one end of the banding
to the other, and as a three/four star hotel, Garden Court will offer
high bedrooms and restaurants, with some limitations of service.
It is likely to be marketed at 25% below the four-star range of
hotels, attracting mainly corporate business, with groups and families
coming in for special weekend breaks and packages. Most of the marketing
is via Holiday Inn's teletext.
This will be the first Holiday Inn hotel in the UK with an interface
which means that the computer will be able to provide a more efficient
service to guests who have stayed at other Holiday Inns.
With the press of a button and via a television screen, staff will
also be able to communicate information and problems immediately leaving
them more time to talk to people.
Maurice Taylor, once an engineering apprentice, knows how important
that can be. He started in the industry as a night porter working in the
long corridors of the Turnberry Hotel in Ayrshire.
A timely chat with a guest one night led to his moving onwards and
upwards through the hotel and restaurant system, eventually opening his
own. This well-trodden route has given him a natural affinity with staff
at every level and he sees Garden Court staff as having even more doors
opening through the Holiday Inn network.
''There will be plenty of opportunity for development and transfer
within Holiday Inns,'' he said. ''The job in Glasgow is a career in
Holiday Inn worldwide.''
Over the next few weeks, general manager Tony Wright will begin to
recruit the management team. He has already circulated some information
within the Holiday Inn network, and expects to have filled some
positions by October. He will also advertise through The Herald and
other local papers.
The local Job Centre will feature largely when it comes to recruiting
most of the other staff, and an Open Day will be arranged towards the
end of October, concentrating on selection and interview. A telephone
number has been advertised and several enquiries have already been
received.
While experience in the industry is important, great emphasis will be
placed on generic qualities like good communication, commitment to
customer care, and friendly outgoing personalities are seen as vital to
the job.
''I have come here from Warrington,'' said Tony, ''and the staff there
have always worked together very much as a team. There is a real family
atmosphere, and an attention to detail. Those are the kind of qualities
we will be looking for, where staff are prepared to go that one step
further.''
Such commitment has its rewards and while there is no obligation for
the new hotel to adopt all of the Holiday Inn practices, many of the
staff incentive schemes will be taken on board -- like special
presentations, extra holidays and complementary hotel vouchers.
Staff in Glasgow will also be able to stay with their families at any
Holiday Inn worldwide for $25 or #16 per night -- room rate -- with a
50% discount on food and beverage.
Training is a top priority with Holiday Inn, and early in November,
trainer Glenda Tutte will arrive to induct the management staff.
When the rest of the staff start on November 20, they will have a
two-day induction from a personnel manager of another Holiday Inn, who
will go through Continuous Service Improvement (CSIP) and World of
Welcome (WOW) guest-orientated training programmes which encourage staff
to be pro-active in caring for guests. There will be ongoing assessment
and appraisal of staff.
''This is a people business,'' said Maurice Taylor. ''No matter how
much money or technological expertise is put into this building, the
most vital role in the whole thing is to pick the right people -- to
create a team, and to share success with them all. Each member of staff
is vital to the operation.''

WRITING about Braveheart, Niall Stuart like many others has confused
nationalism with chauvinism (September 8).
What is wrong with nationalism? It inspires to nationhood; many
countries have this nationalism that asserts a sense of national
identity.
Norway is fiercely nationalist but who would compare the Norweigans to
the Nazis of Germany? The nationalism of Germany's Nazis was
chauvinistic, which asserts a sense of national identity that claims
superiority over others.
To say that this is the case in Scotland is an insult to the Scottish
people, no matter what one's political stance is.

THE four letters under the collective heading Braveheart illustrate
the irrationality, hysteria, and lack of political credibility in the
unionist attempts to denigrate the SNP (September 8).
Michael Ashmore asserts that Scotland's folk heroes belong to all
Scots. Maybe so. However, as he is obviously a unionist, I am curious as
to why he would want to express admiration for a freedom fighter for
Scottish independence.
Andrew Brocklehurst remarks that the SNP won less than a quarter of
the vote at the last election. Perhaps he would care to remind us of how
representative of Scottish public opinion his party currently is. In
relation to his assertion that the SNP's link with William Wallace is
stupid, is the objective of Scottish independence not common to both?
As for Messrs Stuart and Park, one accuses the SNP of being
narrow-minded nationalists while the other accuses them of the heinous
crime of being broad-minded internationalists. Perhaps they should
research the difference between nationalism of liberation and
self-determination, and the chauvinistic nationalism of Mr
Brocklehurst's party (currently collectively shared with their unionist
allies under the guidance of Messrs Blair and Ashdown).

DAVID MACPHERSON expresses the opinion that John Macleod's writing is
never vicious (September 8).
In his infamous piece on Michael Barrymore John Macleod refers to the
late Derek Jarman as ''a manifest lump of evil''. Surely a vicious
statement by anyone's standards about someone no longer in a position to
defend himself.
I also suspect other statements made by John Macleod will be regarded
as equally malicious by gay readers. Perhaps, however, there aren't too
many left by now.
As well as John Macleod's regular diatribes, several other columnists
on your newspaper clearly share some of his views on homosexuality.

HYMAN KAPLAN, who he? In a landslide of letters (two) every Tom, Dick,
and Harriet have been asking questions about the prince of night school
pupils. More, more, they have cried.
Last Tuesday Kaplan was dumped on their heads here. At the time Hymie
had seemed topical again. All the enrolling for evening classes makes
him a September man. Truth to tell, he was only a squiggle in the
classroom jotter of my memory.
Not everybody's thin layer of learning is the same. What every other
schoolboy is supposed to know need not include, say, being aware of the
place in football lore of Davie Lapsley or of why Paisley sometimes gets
called Seestu.
Kaplan, though, dwells in a different league. He is not of the
ordinary world. He ought to be as famous as Popeye.
Hyman Kaplan was a creation of Leonard Q Ross, except there was no
such person. Nobody ever got called Leonard Q Ross. It was a name used
to hide behind by a remarkable man of letters who in his ordinary life
answered to Leo Rosten. He was an essayist, novelist, biographer,
scriptwriter, and populariser of philosophy. He edited a lexicon of
Yiddish words.
He produced a social tract that took the lid off Hollywood, while in
Washington he did a thesis about newspaper correspondents at the White
House. For a change from the mush and jargon of sociology Leo Rosten
invented Kaplan. For his hobby of being a weekend humorist he took a
second name.
Hymie also had his own way with his name. In school exercises it was
always printed in capital letters. If memory serves, he used red crayon
outlined in blue. Between the letters appeared sparkling stars. So he
was H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N. The stars were green.
His way with the rest of the language was also colourful. He had his
own rules. By Hyman's way of it the opposite of height was lowth. He
thought the plural of sandwich was delicatessen. Asked to give the
principal parts of ''to die,'' he responded with die, dead, funeral.
On one memorable evening in class he defined diameter as a machine
that counts dimes.
The college where Kaplan was a perpetual student was the American
Night Preparatory School for Adults, founded l9l0. It taught English and
civics to immigrants so they could qualify for citizenship.
Hyman, from Kiev, had for fellow pupils other incomers who had fled
from revolution in Greece, pogroms in Poland, or drought in Italy. To
show that they could write English most of the men wore like a medal in
their breast pockets a fountain pen. Kaplan carried two.
His genius was to remain unimpressed by the centuries of usage and
experiment which had gone into the language. In his smiling,
cherub-faced way he agreed there had to be proper ways of doing English,
only they did not apply to him.
He could not, for instance, be induced to respect the work of Herman
Melville. ''Mopy Dick,'' quoth Hymie, ''gives more attention to fish dan
to pipple.''
His classmates included Miss Rose Mitnick, the star student although
too shy ever to win a gold star, and Olga Tarnova, who worked for a
milliner in Greenwich village and had very long eye lashes.
A pedantic foe of Kaplan was Peter Studniczka, who for a bible and
constant companion carried a battered copy of l000 Words Commonly
Misspelled.
Like Kaplan, the class teacher, the long-suffering, angelically
patient Mr Parkhill, believed it was possible to take spelling too
seriously.
Here is a practical aspect of Leo Rosten's work that has kept it wise
and current since Kaplan first appeared as a magazine character in l924.
Every generation since has complained that the generation coming after
it cannot spell. Perhaps, it was ever thus.
Mr Parkhill, pronounced Pockheel by Kaplan, taught his class not to
lie awake at night worrying about spelling. It had nothing to do with
their worth as citizens or even with their intelligence.
It is a thought echoed by Charles Dickens with whom Leo Rosten has
been compared.
In Pickwick Papers when Sam Weller steps briskly into the witness box
in the case of Bardell against Pickwick, he is asked by Mr Justice
Stareleigh, a short fat man who seemed all face and waistcoat: ''What's
your name, sir?''
''Sam Weller, my Lord.''
''Do you spell it with a V or a W?'' inquired the judge.
''That depends upon the taste and fancy of the speller, my Lord,''
replied Sam. ''I have never had occasion to spell it more than once or
twice in my life, but I spell it with a V.''
How Mr Parkhill put it was: ''After all one does not need to spell
English in order to use it.''
Right enough, he was talking to a class who included a non-comformist
who insisted that every rule of grammar had to prove its case anew every
time. Hyman Kaplan made the whole language go back to scratch.
If host and hostess go together, he wanted to know, why is there no
feminine of ghost? Asked to define a blessing, he wrote: ''Dat's an okay
fromm God.''
It is clear what Hymie meant. The spelling is immaterial, which is a
big enough lesson for any Tuesday day school. (Davie Lapsley is a former
mighty captain of St Mirren. Telling how Paisley became Seestu would
take the whole page.)

THE TUC's annual conference is serving notice that the period of good
labour relations, at least as measured by a low incidence of strikes,
may be passing. A new note of militancy can certainly be heard even from
the TUC's own moderate leadership, and a fresh confidence can be
identified among trade unionists just as a new public awareness of
unions' positive qualities has, according to opinion polls, re-emerged
in the past three years, and was certainly demonstrated in the sympathy
for the striking railway workers last year, if less assuredly this
summer. Ballots are to be held later this week among BT engineers and
the civil servants running the Employment Service to see whether strikes
should take place next month over their grievances. Though the first is
not about pay, the second is to reject an offer of 2.75%, which is far
from derisory in an age of low inflation, and at a time when many
employees are being offered nothing at all. (Perhaps that is exactly
what evidence of renewed militancy involves.)
Actually it all remains to be seen: this week will show whether last
month's small rise in unemployment was merely a blip or the beginning of
a new trend. If the latter is the case, new militancy would be
ill-timed: it is always hard to promote strike action, however
justified, when jobs are shrinking. Even at the moment, the idea that
employees of the Employment Service are ''desperate to leave,'' as their
general-secretary is reported as saying, seems improbable. Though their
frustration may be beyond dispute, it is hard to imagine them easily
migrating to similar but better-paid jobs, a difficulty they share with
many white-collar workers. The whole labour market has changed -- and
not just because of anything done by governmental deregulation -- and it
has changed for the worse from employees' points of view in that it is
much less secure and may be offering fewer full-time jobs. There is no
doubt that all this is resented but, as American experience has shown,
it is hard for organised labour to counter. Any new militancy will have
a hard task.
Perhaps the way forward will be for the unions to use political
institutions to their advantage. The demand for a national minimum wage
by parliamentary enactment is an example of one such way forward,
although the AEU's leadership being reminded of the need to protect
differentials is an indication of one traditional source of doubt about
the egalitarian effects. The possibility that the national minimum could
be phased in over five years will make it more appealing to Mr Blair who
apparently worries about its immediate impact on jobs. The Government
also worries about the impact of our adhesion to the Social Chapter of
the Maastricht Agreement -- which is why it negotiated the opt-out from
its provisions. But the head of the EU Commission, following his
predecessor's rapport with the TUC, addressed the conference yesterday
and recommended it press for Britain's accession to the chapter's
provisions. There seems little reason to doubt his belief that we will
eventually adhere (a Labour Government certainly would), but Downing
Street is as cool to his rhetoric as it was to Mr Delors'.
The drawback with the institutional approach to improvements for
workers is that its focus is inevitably, apart from the minimum wage,
focused on social wages. What tends to inspire militancy are claims for
cash rises for particular groups. Even the German economy has not
avoided that phenomenon. Not only ''bad employers'' may be worried if
the new militancy proves to involve more than talk.

THE Russians are irked and getting unhappier by the minute at the
situation in Bosnia. One of the many questions confronting Nato and the
United Nations is how seriously these Russian objections should be
treated. From the Russian point of view the bombing and shelling of
Bosnian Serb targets was bad enough but the use of Tomahawk cruise
missiles is perceived as being much worse. Nato has said repeatedly that
the launching of cruise missiles does not represent an escalation of the
action against the Bosnian Serbs. This is unconvincing. While it can be
appreciated that the missiles were needed to knock out the sophisticated
Serb radar system (even if they have failed to do this satisfactorily)
Nato spokesmen have sounded cagey when discussing the possibility of the
civilian casualties claimed by the Bosnian Serbs. The simple fact is
that a cruise missile is an escalation over the conventional bombing and
shelling already used and to claim otherwise is disingenuous. Nor have
the Russians been mollified by the dismissive tone used by EU Foreign
Ministers in response to their complaints. The antics of the Russian
parliament, the Duma, which postured angrily against the bombing and
shelling, are not sufficiently serious to be taken into great
consideration. The warnings of President Yeltsin are a different matter.
Those who suspect the Russian President of working up the issue before
a home audience in the volatile period leading up to Russian elections
are probably correct. Yeltsin has to counteract the effects of extreme
nationalists, most of whom are vociferously on the side of the Serbs. It
seems that he and the more responsible members of the Russian Government
are genuinely upset at the way in which Nato and the United Nations have
treated their objections. Little improvement in this was shown last
night when Nato Secretary-General Willy Claes flatly rejected Russian
appeals to stop the bombing campaign. In effect Mr Claes said that even
if Russia could not accept Nato military activities Nato would carry on
regardless. Now, this may be the right position to adopt. Nato and the
United Nations have made fools of themselves on previous occasions by
exhibiting chronic indecision. Mr Claes may be sensible to imply that
Russian views on this subject are of little weight, but he could do it
more tactfully.
President Yeltsin has gone on holiday but nobody should expect that
this will lessen complaints from Moscow, though Vitaly Churkin's meeting
with Nato ambassadors yesterday was less testing than expected. Churkin
told the ambassadors that Russia is worried about matters getting out of
hand. His hints that Nato action might affect efforts to build a
constructive relationship between them were delivered diplomatically,
but were marred by earlier comments from Russia's blowhard Defence
Minister Pavel Grachev. He warned Nato to stop air strikes or face a
Russian reassessment of Nato's Partnership for Peace programme which
Russia signed this year only after protracted hesitation. These
difficulties could be dealt with in a different manner if the air
strikes and missile launches had succeeded in lifting the siege of
Sarajevo and the threats to the other safe areas. Unfortunately they
have not. The Bosnian Serb military appears independent of Bosnian Serb
political control and one person who can put sufficient pressure on the
military is the Serbian leader, President Slobodan Milosevic. He is
tempted by the possibility of the lifting of sanctions against his
country, but he is also susceptible to pressure from the Russians. Nato
and the UN are hopeful that Moscow will apply this pressure so that it
may filter down to the Bosnian Serb military. For this utterly pragmatic
reason, and leaving aside the problems of the bombing policy, the
Russians should be treated with a little more care and consideration.

Ian Bruce argues that Nato's use of cruise missiles in the Bosnian
conflict is not a sudden escalation but the next logical step in putting
pressure on the Serbs
TOMAHAWK cruise missiles are the rich man's method of waging risk-free
war. At $2m apiece, they do not come cheap, but they are less than 10%
the price of a conventional fighter bomber. More importantly, they do
not put a vulnerable and expensively trained pilot in harm's way.
The salvo which slammed into Bosnian Serb anti-aircraft missile sites
around Banja Luka early yesterday were the latest Block 3 version of
Tomahawk, capable of delivering a 700lb high-explosive message to within
30 yards of a target at ranges of up to 1800 miles.
The impact of the strike was calculated to be psychological as well as
inflicting substantial damage on an air defence network which still
poses a considerable threat to Nato war plans. While underlining the
alliances' total military superiority, it was also a pointed reminder to
the Serb high command that it can run, but it can no longer hide behind
a surface-to-air missile screen.
Operation Deny Flight is a fortnight old today. More than 2000 manned
sorties have so far failed to persuade Serb leaders to come to the
negotiating table intent on anything but prevarication. Stalling for
time and double-dealing are about the only weapons left in Serb General
Ratko Mladic's depleted armoury and he has played them for all they are
worth.
But his military machine is being damaged in a campaign of steady
attrition. He had to resort to ham radio operators yesterday to find out
how hard his own forces had been hit. Precision strikes and bombing of
key strategic bridges have also weakened his ability to transfer units
and hardwear from one battlefront to another. More tellingly, it has
also restricted the movement of ammunition and other vital supplies.
The two keys to success in any military operation are control of
communications and logistics. A commander who lacks the means to
discover the big picture and react to it has lost the initiative. A
commander who cannot supply his men has lost the battle, and perhaps the
war.
Public perception of Nato air operations was that a short, sharp blitz
of Serb gun batteries would end the three-year-old bloodbath. It was
always a false and unrealistic expectation. The air campaign, given the
relatively limited resources allotted to it, is based on graduated steps
of punitive action with a target list stretching over several months if
necessary. The object was never to deliver a crippling blow to Serb
forces in the hope of a quick-fix political solution. Both Muslims and
Croats are waiting in the wings, eager for revenge and territory, and
the Serbs cannot be left defenceless if the conflict is to be halted in
its tracks.
Far from being an escalation, the Tomahawk attack was the next logical
step in a policy of gradual response. It is aimed at upping the pain
threshold rather than inflicting a knockout punch.
So far, the Serbs have been sparing in their use of radar-controlled
missiles. They know that Nato has weapons designed to lock on to radars
and ride down their beams to their obliteration. Two Nato aircraft are
thought to have been downed by radar-guided Sams over the past three
years, but the only aircraft lost in the past fortnight fell victim to a
simple, shoulder-fire, heat-seeking weapon.
Elimination of the more dangerous and surprisingly sophisticated air
defence network placed to protect key military headquarters and other
installations is a necessary prelude to further pinpoint attacks by
bombers. The Tomahawks were sent in to pave the way for unchallenged
control of the air at medium and high altitudes.
With the Sam threat suppressed, the only remaining dangers at low
level are heat-seekers and the Soviet-designed ZSU-23 rapid-fire cannon.
These mobile guns can spit out up to 4000 rounds a minute putting up a
wall of lead into the path of attacking war planes. They are simple but
deadly, as a number of allied airmen discovered in the Gulf.
The US Navy launched 284 Tomahawk missiles against Iraqi targets in
1991. About 80% of these found their targets, as opposed to just 55% of
all other ''smart'' weapons employed. Some were shot down, making easy
targets at the relatively low speed of 550mph. But several went
completely astray and killed civilians, prompting a top priority review
of their computer guidance software.
The Pentagon has spent nearly $40m modifying the system. The result is
a thinking bomb which is now programmed to check its flight path via a
series of links with the Global Positioning System, a satellite network
accurate to a few yards. On the final run-in to target, the Tomahawk can
assess any drift from its planned course and either correct it or veer
off to impact on the nearest plot of uninhabited land to minimise the
risk of ''collateral damage'' -- dead civilians. Its terrain-following
radar is linked to maps stored within its internal computer.
The Tomahawk is not perfect, but it is many times more accurate than a
bomb dropped by a manned aircraft. It skims in at under 100ft making it
impervious to weather conditions, and it has the unique advantage that
it knows no fear. Quite understandably, pilots beginning a bomb run can
be distracted by streams of enemy tracer arcing up to meet them from
ground defences.
If there is any single significance in the Tomahawk barrage, apart
from a prime opportunity to test the new missile under combat
conditions, it is perhaps a very unsubtle message to General Mladic. If
the strike can pinpoint and destroy his Sams leaving his headquarters
vulnerable then the next salvo could easily be directed closer to home.
It also emphasises the point that trying to buy time until winter cloud
blankets the war zone is no protection against an opponent holding all
of the hi-tech cards in his computer-guided hand.

Tom Gallagher considers whether Sarajevo's reputation for religious
tolerance could be a casualty of the Bosnian conflict
UNNOTICED last month as Krajina was emptied of its Serbs and Sarajevo
was subjected to more bombardment, was the outbreak of political strife
in that tormented capital. Since 1992 the battle for survival had pushed
political rivalries into the background. But following the string of
reverses suffered by the rebel Serb foes of the Bosnian government,
splits in the Sarajevo leadership have burst into the open.
This is not an ethnic dispute between Serb and Croat members of the
government and the dominant Muslims but one between liberal and
clericalist Muslims. The spokesman of the moderates is Haris Silajdzic,
the Prime Minister, while radicals are grouped around President Alija
Izetbegovic.
Before the war, to be Muslim in Bosnia was an identity tag which did
not carry a great deal of religious significance. Fewer than 10% of
Muslims practised their faith. Not only Sarajevo but other Bosnian towns
were known for their cosmopolitan feel. But the outbreak of a war which,
in 1992, was directed mainly against Muslim civilians, has revived
dormant religious sentiments.
Many young intellectuals who previously wore their religion lightly
and were more interested in the music of Madonna than in the religious
message from Mecca, have changed their outlook. They have concluded that
it is because of their religion and oriental image that the West has
stood aside and allowed a European city like Sarajevo to be pounded to
rubble, with 10,000 dead and 60,000 wounded.
Their spokesman is the young minister of education and culture, Enes
Karic, who has openly declared that there is no future for Muslims in
Europe unless they have a state of their own. With financial backing
from conservative Muslim states, he has started to alter the previously
secular education system to give it more of an Islamic flavour.
The sense of abandonment by the West has been expressed with bitter
poignancy by Dr Mustafa Ceric, the Imam of Sarajevo. He is no bigot but
a highly educated divine who taught and preached for five years in
America and was an advocate of Muslim-Christian dialogue even after the
war started. But by the first anniversary of the Sarajevo siege his
anger towards the West was palpable.
According to Ceric: ''We are being killed because we want to live
together. You see, we Bosnians are defending your principles in Europe.
We are defending the principles of the United Nations and its
Secretary-General -- and he is the only one who is breaking these
principles. I ask you, is there anything left of humanity in the West?
Is there anything left of justice or humanism? Because humanism is
buried here in Bosnia. I don't know who is going to resurrect it.''
The newspaper Ljiljan (whose name stands for the lilies which are the
Bosnian state's official emblem) has become the voice of the new Muslim
awareness in Bosnia. It is financed by well-wishers in Muslim states and
has begun to question the usefulness of mixed marriages in a Bosnia
transformed by ethnic cleansing and war.
Ljiljan is close to the SDA, the ruling Democratic Action Party of
President Izetbegovic, a man whose mildness is tempered by unshakeable
religious views. He is certainly not the intolerant zealot that Serb
propagandists harp on about. But he has promoted individuals who wish to
forge a national identity for Bosnia derived in large part from its
Islamic heritage.
In conditions of war, the SDA has extended its hold throughout the
state. Its influence is felt particularly in television but also in the
army and in the economic sphere; inevitably, fears have been expressed
that a one-party state may be in the making.
The appointment of an urbane Muslim like Mohammed Filipovic to head
the Bosnian embassy in London and the survival of an independent mayor
like Tuzla's, who is known to many British aid workers, shows that
pluralism still has life in it. But it will be a delayed victory for the
rebel Serb tormentors of Bosnia if their victims begin to assume some of
the extremist traits that were unfairly assigned to them in the past.
Perhaps it will even prove relatively easy for hardliners in the SDA
and Dr Karadzic's extremist Serbs to reach a compromise resulting in a
truncated Muslim state in central Bosnia.
That sectarian solution would be bitterly opposed above all in
Sarajevo where 40% of the inhabitants were the offspring of mixed
marriages. Multi-cultural living is still a reality there after more
than 1200 days under siege. Rebel Serb shells do not discriminate on a
religious basis and in each of the biggest massacres perpetrated by
Karadzic's side, non-Muslims invariably have been among the dead.
Oslobodenje, the daily Sarajevo newspaper, is the voice of
multi-cultural Bosnia. Only on one day did the war prevent it appearing.
Backing from well-wishers, particularly the Open Society Fund of
maverick financier George Soros, has kept it going. It is a staunch
backer of Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic who is the chief liberal voice
in the Sarajevo leadership.
A Muslim and a trained historian, Dr Silajdzic's skills as a diplomat
and a fund-raiser brought international recognition and cash to Bosnia
in the desperate years of 1992-93 when it had little else going for it.
Early on, the goodwill towards Bosnia that he encountered in Europe and
north America convinced him that governments imposing an arms embargo
and virtual surrender terms on his state were not speaking for the bulk
of its citizens.
In the spring he broke ranks with some of his colleagues by boycotting
a ceremony in which political leaders paid homage to the Bosnian army's
most overtly Islamic unit, the 7th Muslim Brigade. He rallied liberal
Muslims and Serbs and Croats on the ruling council, unhappy that the war
was being seen in terms of the defence of Bosnian Muslims alone.
The split widened in the summer following the appointment of a new
Bosnian vice-president, Edhem Bicakoic, who did not conceal his
clericalist outlook. Silajdzic blamed some military reverses on
politicisation of sections of the army with promotions being based on
political reliability rather thn military competence.
He also complained that he was unable to give a satisfactory account
to foreign donors of some money that he raised because it was controlled
by the ruling party rather than the government.
Last month Silajdzic finally tendered his resignation, the last straw
apparently being an amendment to the constitution which laid down that,
in war conditions, only a Muslim could be head of state. With the Imam
of Sarajevo already second only to the President in terms of protocol,
this would have suggested multi-culturalism was ebbing fast.
But the Prime Minister was persuaded to reconsider, his departure
being likely to weaken the image of the Bosnian government, especially
in the West.
Now that the shifting fortunes of war and diplomacy have at last eased
pressure on Sarajevo, it is decisions that the government makes itself
rather than ones imposed on it by others which will determine Bosnia's
fate. The decline of Karadzic's Serb statelet offers some useful lessons
for Sarajevo.
Extremism and intolerance got such a grip among the rulers of Pale and
Banja Luka that they began to make elementary blunders that weakened
their position enormously. A Bosnia where diversity and free choice
continue to be a way of life will be far less easy to isolate and
discredit. But until it becomes possible for politicians to go before
the people in elections, it is difficult to tell how much of Bosnian
multi-culturalism still survives.

Carole Hodge explains how Serbs are challenging Serbs in the struggle
against the ethnic partitioning of Bosnia
AT the end of a week when Karadzic's Serbs continued to shell civilian
targets in Sarajevo, Tuzla, Bihac, and elsewhere in defiance of Nato air
strikes, and US diplomats shuttled between Belgrade, Moscow, and Geneva
in search of a solution in which the password to peace is partition, an
assembly of Bosnian politicians, lawyers, university professors,
writers, and others flew from Sarajevo to London to press their case for
the survival of the sovereign, multi-ethnic state of Bosnia.
The dichotomy between the two positions contains an irony for more
reasons than one. While the international peace talks still focus on the
51%-49% division of Bosnia Herzegovina between the Bosnian/Croat
Federation and the Serbs respectively, a solution supported with varying
degrees of enthusiasm by the Contact Group of five countries (America,
Britain, France, Russia, and Germany) plus Serbian President Milosevic,
the ethnic partition of Bosnia Herzegovina appears to be opposed by the
majority of Bosnians themselves.
The remarkable feature of Saturday's gathering at Central Hall,
Westminster is that the majority of Bosnians who spoke were in fact
Bosnian Serbs, representing the Serb Civic Council in Sarajevo.
Sharing a platform with the Bosnian ambassador to Britain, Dr Muhamed
Filipovic, himself of Muslim ethnic origin, they illustrated
individually and collectively the folly of a policy which seems to be
reconciled to ethnic divisions in a country which has been characterised
by its multi-ethnicity for a millennium, and to ratify internationally
the existence of an entity within Bosnia, Republika Srpska, which has
been founded on ''ethnic cleansing'' and genocide.
The first speaker, Mico Rakic, introduced by the Bosnian ambassador as
''a true fighter against fascism'' (both having fought together in the
Yugoslav partisan movement in the Second World War), appealed to British
people to help multi-ethnicity in Bosnia Herzegovina to survive.
Dr Rakic, himself of Serbian ethnic origin, explained how his eldest
daughter had married a Jew, his younger daughter a Croat, and his sister
a Muslim, and that if Bosnia was divided along ethnic lines, Europe
would lose some of its most important attributes of civilisation.
Dragoljub Stojanov, an economist, was born in Serbia of mixed
Vojvodinian/Croatian parentage, and settled in Sarajevo in 1948. He
explained the serious dilemma he personally would be faced with if
forced to choose between a Muslim/Croat Federation and an ethnically
segregated Serb state, while Mirko Pejanovic described the Serb Civic
Council, of which he is president, as the ''humanitarian opposition'' to
the regime of Karadzic who killed 12,000 people in Sarajevo, in his
intent to prove to the world that he could not live together with
Bosnians and Croats.
Dr Pejanovic claimed that out of the 1.3 million Serbs who lived in
Bosnia prior to the current conflict, 500,000 were now refugees abroad,
while 150,000 live in the area under the control of the legal Bosnian
Government, and estimated that not more than 500,000 Serbs remained
under Karadzic's control.
General Jovan Divjak, the Serbian deputy commander of the Bosnian
Government forces, spoke of his pride in being a member of the Bosnian
army, and pointed out that most of the territory held by Karadzic's
forces was in fact seized by Yugoslav National Army units from Serbia
and Montenegro.
He stressed the need for Nato air strikes to continue and the arms
embargo to be lifted in order to achieve balance on the ground and end
the siege of Sarajevo, an appeal which will be carried by the Serb Civic
Council to Washington next week.
The sanity of the moral and pragmatic arguments behind the plea of the
Serb Civic Council to the international community to support the
endurance of multi-ethnicity in Bosnia Herzegovina seems irrefutable.
For if the existence of a racially segregated state in the middle of
Europe is supported by the international community, then a precedent is
set for ethnic apartheid through aggression elsewhere, and racial
intolerance, a phenomenon Britain has officially militated against for
decades.
But there is something else, too. If Dr Pejanovic's figures are right,
this means that 49% of Bosnian territory is being awarded to about 11%
of the population. Even if twice as many Serbs as Dr Pejanovic estimates
remain in Karadzic-controlled territory, it would still be the case that
49% of territory was being allocated to only 22% of the population!
This, along with the fact that the territory was acquired through the
most brutal aggression known to Europe since the 1940s, and is presided
over by indicted war criminals, brings the wisdom and integrity of the
international community even further into question.
Added to this is the announcement by Dr Biljana Plavsic, one of
Radovan Karadzic's leading deputies, on Bosnian Serb TV last weekend
that any Serbs leaving the territory they now occupied in so-called
Republika Srpska would be ''severely dealt with'' under martial law.
Since the international community shows no stomach for enforcing
withdrawal from land taken by force, the current status quo might well
prevail, with Karadzic's Serbs -- estimated at somewhere between 11% and
22% of the total Bosnian population -- still in occupation of 72% of
Bosnia Herzegovina.
Apart from the clear injustice of such a situation, bearing in mind
the millions of dispossessed civilians and refugees in Bosnia, it is
important to consider the social unrest which is likely to develop
within the Bosnian/Croat Federation, which will continue to be
overcrowded and increasingly unbalanced, both politically and
militarily, as Croatia grows in power.
Should the victims of the aggression be denied the chance to regain
lost territory and return to their homes, and to witness the punishment
of the perpetrators of genocide, then sooner or later there is likely to
be renewed conflict between Bosnian Muslims and Croats, as each ethnic
group struggles for its own survival in deteriorating conditions. The
long-term outcome of such a conflict would probably be a Serb/Croat
carve-up, and the total disappearance of the internationally recognised
sovereign state of Bosnia Herzegovina, along with its multi-ethnic,
multi-cultural traditions.
An alternative to all this is to heed the voice of the Bosnian
majority, which in turn means adhering to the tenets of the Geneva
Convention, the United Nations Charter, the numerous UN Security Council
and Nato resolutions, and the recommendations of the Council of Europe,
as well as to the principles of the London Conference of 1992, which
stipulated inter alia that the international community would not permit
the partition of Bosnia Herzegovina by conquest.
Or have we moved into an era where such principles no longer apply?

Malcolm Dickson looks at how constituency changes could affect the
major parties at the next General Election
A LARGE majority of voters at the next General Election will support
candidates in seats that have been altered following the deliberations
of the Boundary Commissions for Scotland, England, and Wales. Almost 500
of the new total of 659 Westminster seats will be fought under new
constituency names and boundaries.
Such changes, of course, are not merely arbitrary but are introduced
after a considerable analysis of the way in which our population's
structure changes over time. The commission's job is essentially to
provide a recommendation of how parliamentary seats should be allocated
on the basis of population.
We live in a society which sees population change occur over much
shorter periods than ever before and it is therefore fundamental that
the commission does its job correctly.
This current round of changes is particularly interesting, not only
because of the extent of the changes, but also in relation to just what
our population is like nowadays and, perhaps most important of all, what
the changes imply for the subsequent fortunes of the political parties.
Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of the University of Plymouth have
made some estimates of how the boundary changes might have affected the
result of the 1992 General Election. Overall, they suggest that the
Tories would have had a slightly higher majority of 27 rather than 21.
This estimate is based on projections of the results in the new
parliamentary seats based on results in individual wards at local
government level. These wards are also used by the commission as one of
its fundamental building blocks in drawing up new constituency
boundaries.
But how accurate a picture is this of how the parties might now be
standing if the new boundaries had been the basis of the 1992 General
Election? Like all psephological estimates there can be a disagreement
over how one might arrive at the final figures. In providing a rough
idea of how the things might have gone in 1992, this new research is
very reasonable. However, the result in 1992 was, some might argue, a
distortion of the true political make-up of the country.
It can be pointed out by advocates of electoral reform that changes in
constituency boundaries merely amount to a remixing of voters into new
groups that will still be subject to the first-past-the-post voting
system which does not allow a fair reflection of the proportions of
votes cast for the political parties.
Another factor which is evident, even from Rallings and Thrasher's
study, is that the number of marginal constituencies (that is
constituencies where sitting MPs have majorities of around 2000 or
less), is still broadly the same at around 160. The significance of this
is only established when considering the proportion of marginals 30 to
40 years ago. Then marginals accounted for around half of the
parliamentary seats. Our political system has polarised in electoral
terms.
For example in Scotland, if we look at the change between the General
Elections of 1987 and 1992 (excluding by-elections which were won and
subsequently returned to the party originally holding the seat), only
one seat out of 72 -- that of Aberdeen South -- changed hands. Yet over
the same period, the SNP's share of the vote had increased 50% but they
won no more seats. The Liberal-Democrats, on the other hand, lost over
6% of their vote share yet held on to the same number of seats.
The overall effect of the boundary changes provides little scope for
the breaking of the dominance of Labour and Conservatives in British
terms and Labour's dominance in both Wales and Scotland. The new seats,
if fought in 1992, would have resulted in Scotland in one more for
Labour, one less for the Liberal-Democrats with the other parties
unchanged. In other words, very little change.
But of course it is not the job of the Boundary Commission to alter
the political complexion of Westminster, but to make adjustments that
take account of the changes in the population. It is perhaps in this
area that any estimates of previous or subsequent electoral success come
under the most pressure.
In 1992, research carried out by Jeremy Smith of Warwick University
and Ian McLean of Nuffield College, Oxford, discovered that Labour may
have lost up to seven seats and the Liberal-Democrats up to three
because of incomplete electoral registers which had seen large numbers
of people fail to register to vote as a result of the poll tax.
Indeed, the recorded population of England in the 1991 census is over
500,000 short of the Government's estimates of the true numbers. It is
easy to see how significant this is when the total population shortfall
in Britain is equivalent to 10 parliamentary constituencies.
Yet the commission in its deliberations has no provision to allow for,
or take account of, levels of non-registration of electors. While the
poll tax may have come and gone, the problem over the missing voters has
not been rectified. The introduction of the council tax has not seen any
tendency in individuals re-enrolling. If this continues to be the case,
with many never re-enrolling, then the advantage that this gave to the
Conservatives in 1992 will last over a considerably longer period.
In the final analysis, Labour would be reasonably pleased with the
seven-seat advantage to the Tories that has been suggested. However,
with the deficient electoral registers forming the basis of the current
redrawing of boundaries, then Labour's loss may be compounded by
anything up to 20 seats.
With some recent Gallup and Mori opinion-poll evidence of a chipping
away at Labour's lead, Tony Blair's public warnings over the possibility
of his party becoming complacent may turn out not to be far off the
mark.
We live in a society which sees population change occur over much
shorter periods than ever before

As Hong Kong prepares for the most democratic elections the colony has
ever enjoyed, Chris Dobson examines the irony that they could soon be
cast aside by China
HONG KONG is preparing for its last democratic elections before 1997
with psychedelic posters, promotional T-shirts and videos, a media
blitz, and the constant reminder that in less than 700 days the whole
system is under threat of being scrapped by China.
From 7.30am next Sunday, up to 2.5 million registered voters will be
able to cast their ballot papers at almost 500 polling booths for the
138 candidates fighting for 60 seats in the colony's Legislative
Council. They will have a choice of 11 parties, varying from the
pro-Chinese Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, through
independent and neutral candidates, to a loose liberal democratic
alliance which is being tipped to do well.
Political campaigner, barrister, and Democratic Party chairman Martin
Lee believes his group could win up to a sixth of the seats and will
become a ''very strong minority''.
''The democrats are doing well in the election,'' Lee said. We have
put forward 15 candidates and at least 10 will come through.''
To add to potential confusion on the ballot papers, more than one
million of the electorate will also be able to vote for two different
categories covering geographical regions and functional or
professional-based constituencies, like medical or financial services.
The results should be known by the following day, September 18, and
the new legislators will take their seats for the final term under
British rule next month, in what is supposed to be a four-year
appointment.
But as well as being the last democratic election, it will also be the
first where all of the seats will be chosen by the voters, rather than
partly appointed by the administration.
''These are the most democratic elections for the legislature we have
ever had in Hong Kong,'' said Kerry McGlynn, spokesman for the last
British Governor, Chris Patten.
''The campaign is being conducted in the way you would expect of a
place like Hong Kong, with a great deal of skill and enthusiasm. There
is never any sign of political extremism.
''So if the Chinese side want to dismantle the legislature that has
been elected in a democratically free, fair, and open way, they are
going to have a difficult job explaining it away to the community of
Hong Kong, to the people who voted for the legislature, and to the
international community.
''The international community will make a judgment on China, on the
way it behaves after 1997 and the promises it makes.''
When Patten pushed through a package of democratic reforms, including
the forthcoming elections, Beijing, in a series of hostile attacks,
threatened to dismantle the assembly on its resumption of sovereignty on
July 1, 1997, and appoint its own assembly before holding separate
elections.
Political observers believe Beijing will wait to see how well the
pro-China camp, which is being partly funded by Chinese banks and other
institutions, fares in the results before taking action, if any.
''I don't think the Chinese leaders know what they will do after they
take over in 1997,'' said Lee, who received an award from the American
Bar Association in Chicago last month for his campaigning efforts and
who was later barred from entering China for an international law
conference.
''We are not in a position to comment on it,'' Kevin Wong, a spokesman
for the Hong Kong government's registration and electoral office, said
of China's threat. ''But we just do what we have to do.''
At the last Legislative Council elections in 1991 there was a turnout
of 47% for the functional and 39.1% for the geographical constituencies,
which McGlynn said was better than many Western countries could hope
for.
But out of a population of nearly six million, and a potential
electorate of 3.9 million voters, only 2.5 million have registered to
vote.
In a bid to encourage those who have registered to turn out on Sunday,
senior government officials, including the acting Chief Secretary,
Donald Tsang, made a public appearance last Friday wearing special
''election T-shirts''.
A garish poster, with greens, reds, and purples splashed over a
bespectacled female candidate, looking like it should be promoting an
underground rave party, has been erected around Hong Kong islands by
independent politician Christine Loh.
Loh, a British-educated lawyer, has also made a promotional video
showing her pressing the flesh and has even got behind a microphone to
sing about her actions.

If Paisley's drug pushers thought her recent stroke would knock the
fight out of MP Irene Adams, they were wrong, as Margaret Vaughan
discovers
THE dark menace of the drugs gangs doesn't scare Irene Adams. Lying
flat on a hospital bed in New York, powerless against the enemy that
might destroy her, did scare her. Waiting for the massive seizure
doctors warned might follow the ''mini-stroke'' that left her hand and
leg paralysed, was the worst of all nightmares. She was frightened then,
she says, more than she ever has been. That's saying something for a
woman whose outspoken campaign against the Paisley drugs pushers brought
death threats and harassment of her children.
It's four weeks now since she woke in a darkened hotel bedroom at 4am
to find that her left leg collapsed under her when she got out of bed.
When she tried to open the bathroom door, her left hand wouldn't work.
She went back to sleep hoping it would get better. By 9am it hadn't.
Her daughter, Barbara, called a doctor. Adams, the Labour MP for
Paisley North, was admitted to the Rosewell Hospital. She had suffered
what the neurosurgeon described as a transitory ischaemic attack.
It was a Sunday, five years to the day since her husband Allen, an MP,
had collapsed on holiday in Spain. He died three weeks later. ''It was
dreadful, especially for the children. They had been through this before
with their father. We were at the start of our holiday and the day
before we'd had fun shopping and going for a meal and looking forward to
the rest of our trip. Now here was their mother lying in a hospital bed.
We did fear the worst.''
Within minutes of arriving at the hospital, Adams began to feel ill:
''Before I could count to 10 I was on a trolley and wired up to every
kind of monitoring machine you can imagine. They told me I was having a
small stroke, and there was nothing they could do but wait once it had
started.
''They said that this might be as bad as it was going to get -- or it
could get very bad indeed. They would only know by monitoring me for 12
hours. The most frightening thing was that I hadn't felt ill, there had
been no warning.''
By the following morning Adams was able to move her fingers a little.
Some feeling returned to her leg. The worst was over. She was, she says,
very lucky. Her 23-year-old daughter and son Allen, 17, were profoundly
relieved when she was released from hospital three days later.
Adams has nothing but praise for the treatment she received: brain
scans, ECG, ultrasound monitoring: ''The tests were done and the results
were back within two hours. It was first-class treatment, exceptionally
efficient and impressive, but it was at a price. It cost in all $10,000,
plus another $300 for physiotherapy.''
Conscious of the risks, since her husband's collapse, Adams says she
is always careful to ensure she is insured to the hilt on holiday: ''I'd
taken out full medical insurance for the three of us. I know #58 a head
sounds a lot, but given that the cost of my medical bill did not include
any surgery or major medication, it obviously pays to be heavily
insured.''
Her insurers swung into fast and efficient action after one telephone
call and flew the family home five days ahead of their scheduled return:
''I'd urge anyone going abroad to take out insurance with a reputable
company. At least I didn't have to worry about the bills.''
Adams has now recovered 95% of the power lost to her hand and leg. She
has taken the doctors' advice and stopped smoking: ''I'm chewing madly
on nicotine gum at the moment.''
She has been checked out by her GP since her return -- ''The treatment
here was terrific, as well'' -- and hopes to be given a clean bill of
health within the next few weeks.
Her experience, though, has left her wondering about the provision
available for stroke victims here at home: ''I have to wonder, and I
would like to know, what happens at the sharp end at the hospitals here,
to find out what happens to people in similar circumstances.
''I'm told that the kind of scan I had -- a CAT scan -- is not
available at the local Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley, and that
patients have to be sent to Gartnavel if they need one.
''Yet I was able to have the test done at 9 o'clock on the Tuesday
morning and be sitting with the neurosurgeon discussing the results two
hours later. Here, as we know, people have to wait weeks for the results
of tests.
''It seems to be that we have the equipment and the know-how. What we
seem to be short of are the bodies to operate it.''
The prognosis for Adams seems to be good. Doctors have said a
recurrence is no more likely than in anyone else. The New York doctor
called to her hotel room told her he saw many cases like hers, perhaps
brought on by the intense muggy heat causing high blood pressure.
She has tholed her four-week assize of rest and recuperation, on
medical instructions. Now she is itching to get back to tackling the
other external sources of fear in her constituency. Today, as Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth visits Paisley to announce a tightening up on
controls of Temazepam, Adams serves notice on the drugs pushers that she
is still not afraid and that her campaigning will continue with all the
vigour and determination she can muster. And that's saying something.

PAUL ELLIOTT, the former Celtic player, yesterday praised the people
of Scotland who had rallied round to help stamp out racism in football.
The footballer, who has played in Italy, Scotland and England, was at
the Congress to help launch a campaign to end racism in the game.
Before the debate, Elliott said that there had been considerable
difficulties when he went to play in Scotland in 1989.
''With the help of journalists and the media generally, we were able
to overcome it to a great extent.
''The fact that I was playing for Celtic and Mark Walters playing for
Rangers meant we were able to put the spotlight on the issue, and, with
the help of the media and the Commission for Racial Equality, the
wonderfully warm-hearted attitude of the Scottish people was shown to
us.''
However, Elliott, a former Chelsea captain and now a PFA official,also
told of the racist chants to which he had been subjected in his career.
Fans taunted him with ''monkey'' chants and threw bananas on to the
field.
''Why should black players have to suffer this kind of abuse?'', he
said. ''Around 25% of professional footballers are black, and although
there have been phenomenal improvements in the problem we need to keep
the lid on it.''
Mr Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the PFA, which recently has
been reaffliated to the TUC, moved the motion.
He said that racism was still prevalent in football and ''we must help
stamp it out and then keep a sharp watch.
'In the Premier and Endsleigh Leagues, there are now 25 per cent black
players but in managment and coaching we need to do more,'' he said.
Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the Civil Service Union
CPSA, said: ''Saturday should not be the day when racist filth is
shouted at players who are taking part in our national game.''
Mr Reamsbottom told the Congress there had been just 36 prosecutions
for racist or indecent chants at football matches over the past year
because of a loophole in the 1986 Public Order Act.
''It is an absolute disgrace that for far too long our national game
has been blighted by the presence of racists,'' he added.
Maureen Rooney, of the Amalagamated Engineering and Electrical Union,
said there needed to be a specific law to crack down on racist abuse at
football matches.
She also called for people found guilty of racial abuse at matches to
be expelled from unions if they were members.

CONGRESS was told yesterday of the particular safety fears of British
Telecom engineers in Scotland.
A national ballot for industrial action is being held over measures
which would mean engineers working alone and climbing telegraph poles
during the hours of darkness because of a drive by BT to extend customer
services.
In Brighton yesterday, Ann Robertson, from Edinburgh and the national
executive member for 25,000 members of the Communication Workers' Union
concerned, told of the special problems in Scotland.
''The large tenements in our cities tend to be surrounded by
steel-spiked railing.
''The danger of working in the dark above these railings and other
dangers present in working on dark estates where there is already a
security risk would makes things worse.
''The risk to people working in Scotland's rural areas would seem
obvious to all -- and of course we would be at risk longer, with our
longer dark days,'' Ms Robertson said.
The union has released a confidential BT memo describing the approach
to negotiationg a deal, and acknowledging that the vote against the new
measures would succeed and there would have to be compromise.
The union argues that, apart from the lighting aspect, the company has
not taken security into account.
''Attacks on staff are more prevalent than ever,'' it said in a
statement. The ballot on industrial action will take two weeks with the
annoucment of the result on September 26.
The BT workers' ballot comes at a time when there is hard evidence of
renewed union militancy.
In another dispute, about 20,000 members of the Civil and Public
Services Association at the Employment Service start voting tomorrow on
a strike call in protest at an imposed 2.75% pay increase, which the
union said was the worst in the Civil Service this year.
General secretary Barry Reamsbottom said workers in JobCentres and
employment service offices would strike if the ballot produced a ''yes''
vote, which he predicted would disrupt introduction of the new
Jobseekers allowance.
''The staff have been treated shabbily and are desperate to leave. The
service is really soaking up militancy among moderates,'' he said.
''We cannot take this provocative and cavalier treatment lying down.
Faced with an unreasonable, uncaring employer, I have always believed
that sometimes you are given no other option but to use your weapon of
last resort, strike action.''
Meanwhile, the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union warned of
industrial action against companies which have not cut hours to 37.5 or
37 a week.
Acting general secretary Ken Jackson said: ''We are entirely with
(general secretary) John Monks when he says most employers are good
employers but there are lots of bad ones and now we are going to take
them on.''
''If we are to create more jobs we have to follow the German example
and shorten the working week to 35 hours for all.''
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB, pledged that his union
will support members who decide to take industrial action over the
campaign to win a national minimum rate of #4 an hour.

Congress reports
EUROPEAN Commission president Jacques Santer yesterday disappointed
TUC delegates by only hinting that -- and not actually demanding --
Britain should end its opt-out of key EU policies, including the Social
Chapter.
With next year's EU Inter-Governmental conference on the revision of
the Maastricht treaty in the offing, delegates were hoping that Mr
Santer, from Luxembourg, would use his key address to Congress to nudge
the Government in that direction.
Apparently anxious not to be counter-productive by offending John
Major, Mr Santer played safe in long address.
However, in interviews on radio and television, he went further,
saying that Britain's attitude could not be tolerated indefinitely, and
that ending Britain's opt-out would be on the agenda for next year's
Inter-Governmental meeting.
Mr Santer even conceded that his contribution would have been seen as
disappointing by delegates.
Not suprisingly, TUC general secretary John Monks was far more
insistent that the opt- out must go. The opt-out was on the way out and
next year's meeting must insist that all countries were playing to the
same set of rules, he said.
Mr Monks told delegates: ''The British opt-out is like a sand-castle
in the face of an incoming tide. Some of the towers have already
crumbled and the only question is how soon it will take them all to
topple over.''
The Prime Minsiter, touring the North-east of England, , said he was
''pleased'' with Mr Santer's reported comments.
However, he emphasised that whatever the EU president had said,
Britain had no intention of relinquishing its Maastricht opt-out.
''From our point of view, without wishing to be ungracious in the
light of what he has said, we regard the opt-out as something that is
not negotiable in any event,'' he said.
''I agreed that opt-out. It is not negotiable. We intend to sustain
the opt-out because we believe it is in the interest of Britain to do
so.''
The GMB general union announced yesterday that six more multi-national
companies, including chemicals group ICI, have agreed to sign up to a
European works council which will give their British employees increased
rights to consultation and information.
The union's general secretary, Mr John Edmonds, said: ''The UK opt-out
is becoming a virtual reality. In the real world, employers and unions
are signing up to the European way of doing business.''
Earlier, Mr Santer said: ''I can't imagine that in future we can make
a real social market economy without also a minimum of social standards,
of social rights for workers.
''There is also a question of the functioning of the internal market
for the 15 member states.''
Speaking on BBC Radio, Mr Santer added: ''It's also in the interest of
the British economy.''
Leading Tory Euro-sceptic Sir Teddy Taylor predicted that the
Government would be forced to step into line over the Social Chapter --
despite its claim that it would not be bound by it.
''Unfortunately, Mr Santer is quite right. We keep on deluding
ourselves that we have some freedom because of our exemption,'' he said.
''But we are living in cloud cuckoo land because we think we are
exempt from something when we are not exempt at all. It is deplorable,
but I am afraid that, not for the first time, Mr Santer is seeing things
as they are.''

EDUCATIONAL Institute of Scotland representative Norma Watson told the
Congress that the only good thing to come from the Government's
pre-school voucher scheme was that it had put education for the
under-fives at the top of the education agenda.
Putting forward a motion on nursery education, Ms Watson told
delegates that ''the childcare record in the United Kingdom is the worst
in the European Union.''
She added: ''In Scotland, some local authorities have succeeded in
providing nursery education places for the great majority of
four-year-olds.
''But the provision in other areas is at deplorable low levels, with
no provision at all in many places.''
Ms Watson called for a campaign aimed at the provision of available
places on demand in an appropriate setting for every child.
She also urged statutory funding for local authorities to provide
nursery education for every three and four-year-old where parents wanted
it.

TUC president Leif Mills told delegates that the need for full
employment was the greatest issue facing the country.
In his Congress address, he called for a programme of public works as
an answer to the present unemployment, as in the United States in the
1930s depression.
He said it cost #9000 a year to keep a worker out of employment.
''But sufficient houses are not being built, public transport is
inadequate and public services run down because there are insufficient
people to provide them.
''There is no magic wand, but a measured, considered response would
help.'' Mr Mills said.
The TUC president followed a theme running through this year's
Congress which seeks to put a distance between the unions and the Labour
Party.
He reminded delegates that they were not a political party, and
certainly not an alternative government.
''Our job is to press and cajole those who have power, not to seize
power for ourselves.''
GPMU print union leader Tony Dubbins (above) has declined ''for
personal reasons'' the post of TUC president, which he was due to take
up for a year from the end of this week. His wife died recently and his
union is in turmoil after its annual summer conference was abandoned
because delegates refused to accept newly-elected president Doug
Douglas, who went to the courts against his union after his election was
ruled out on a technicality. By stepping aside, at least for this year,
Mr Dubbins opens the way for Transport and General Workers' Union
national organiser Margaret Prosser to move up a place in the pecking
order to become the first women TUC president since Ada Maddox (of
the-then Nalgo) five years ago
ENGINEERS' leader Jimmy Airlie was in good  form when he seconded the
vote of thanks to TUC president Leif Mills.  Mr Airlie recalled  that he
first met Mr Mills 37 years ago when they came together in the military
police when doing their national service.  He said that as a corporal
and being from Glasgow, he looked at Mr Mills, a second lieutenant and
an Oxford scholar and thought: ''What a prat.'' However, he  had come to
think better of him since.  He added that the TUC president's ability as
a classical scholar may have led to Bill Jordan, the AEEU former
president and a political opponent of Mr Airlie's, to have taken up the
position as a European trade union leader.  ''If so, it just shows that
it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good,'' he said.
CIVIL servant Stuart Currie, from Musselburgh,  a member of the Civil
and Public Services Association, was awarded the TUC's award for youth
at the Congress yesterday.

THE first big oilfield to operate in the British sector of the North
Sea celebrates 20 years of production today -- a birthday it was never
expected to reach.
When the giant Forties complex started pumping crude oil from below
the seabed, it was expected to run dry in commercial terms by 1992.
But, with the aid of developments in technology, operators BP have
pushed the expected life of the country's biggest single oilfield beyond
the year 2000.
The field asset manager, Mr John Mogford, said: ''It would be nice if
Forties got to 40. It is certainly realistic to say it should have a
30th birthday.''
Each of the four main production platforms in Forties contains four
times more steel than the Eiffel Tower and each is big enough to
encapsulate almost the whole of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.
Forties has now given up some 92% of its recoverable reserves of oil,
generating more than #18bn in oil revenue for the UK.
Today's milestone is being marked in Aberdeen with a celebration meal
for dignitaries but it will be business as usual for the 600 men and
women working out in the field.
They and the other 600 Forties workers with whom they alternate will
each have a bottle of 20-year-old malt whisky delivered to their homes.

<HEADLINE>#100,000 for tourism to cash in on Braveheart</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976421080</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A #100,000 package to take advantage of the tourism spin-off from Mel
Gibson's Braveheart was announced yesterday by Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth.
The money will be spent by the Scottish Tourist Board in the
development of marketing campaigns in Germany and France to maximise the
impact of the film about the life of William Wallace.
Mr Forsyth, who attended the premiere in Stirling earlier this month,
cited Crocodile Dundee as an example of how films could benefit tourism.
''Having seen Braveheart, I am convinced that it will do much for
Scotland as a tourist destination. We must seize this opportunity to
capitalise further on encouraging early-season figures showing an
increase of tourist activity in Scotland,'' he said.
The tourist board said plans had already been made to ensure that the
cash was spent effectively.
Welcoming the funding, Mr Tom Buncle, the board's director of
international marketing, said: ''Our task must be to convert awareness
of Scotland into a visit. We will discuss the specific approach with our
partners in the Loch Lomond, Stirling, and Trossachs Tourist Board, the
Scottish travel trade, British Tourist Authority, and 20th Century
Fox.''
* Edinburgh Tourist Board yesterday announced a 67% increase in
visitors to the capital during August compared with 1994 figures.

<HEADLINE>Chevron to pull out of island airport</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Chevron oil company yesterday decided to pull out of Unst airport
in Shetland with the loss of up to 35 jobs.
On the same day, it was announced that redundancies at the island's
other main employer, RAF Saxa Vord, would be much less than feared and
could be reversed.
For the past 16 years Chevron has used the airstrip next to the
village of Baltasound as a forward transit base for offshore workers.
Fixed-wing planes from the mainland transfer passengers to helicopters
at Unst for the 90-mile hop to the Ninian, Heather, Hutton, and
Murchison oilfields.
Chevron's general manager, Mr Gary Fitzgerald, said in Aberdeen that
an ''excellent service'' had been received from Unst but it was no
longer competitive.
Unst councillor Joan Easten said she was ''very disappointed, but not
despairing'' at the news. She added: ''The people there have done a very
good job over the years and have kept going for the past 18 months with
this uncertainty hanging over them.''
She announced that the council, with help from Shetland Enterprise,
was undertaking an appraisal of the economic effects of the pull-out and
compiling a register of skills in Unst.
''We hope we can help them find other jobs,'' she said.
She believed the scheduled air service to Unst and the air ambulance,
both operated by Loganair/BA Express, were secure but the airstrip's
income would obviously decline when Chevron left next March.
Neither Mrs Easten nor council convener Lewis Smith would comment on
Chevron's ''preferred option'' to move the helicopter base 30 miles
south to the airport at Scatsta, next to the Sullom Voe oil terminal.
Meanwhile, the RAF has agreed to shelve plans to ''contractorise'' its
radar base at Saxa Vord hill on the northern tip of Unst.
Mr Smith said that after talks with the council the RAF had agreed to
remove Saxa Vord from a national job cuts programme. It would either
remain as it was, with military personnel running the radar and some
redundancies among civilian staff, or the entire base would be
contracted out to civilian contractors, creating long-term jobs in Unst.

Fairground-owner Alan Codona is one of three new Deputy Lord
Lieutenants being appointed in Aberdeen later today. His appointment is
a break in the tradition of conferring the honour on local dignitaries
and politicians.
Glasgow-born Mr Codona, 49, has run the family's amusement and leisure
business, based at Aberdeen's beach, for more than 25 years. He moved to
the city in 1969 when he won a contract to build a permanent funfair.
The other appointees are Mr John Lamond, a former Lord Provost of the

<TEXT>
A POLICEMAN stole #440 from a pensioner's handbag after she reported a
burglary, a court heard yesterday.
Mrs Daisy Whitelaw, 83, said she had no qualms about showing him where
her money was hidden. ''A policeman doesn't take anything,'' she said.
The jury at St Albans Crown Court convicted Derek Parfitt, 36, of
theft.
Adjourning the case for reports, Judge Colin Colston told Parfitt, who
is married with two children, that he could have bail. However, he
added: ''I make it plain to you that in putting the case back, I hold
out to you no promise whatsoever as to what the outcome will be.
''This is a very grave offence indeed, committed by you when you were
a serving policeman in the Hertfordshire Constabulary.''
Parfitt was stationed at Hemel Hempstead police station as a constable
when on October 11 last year he and a woman officer went to Mrs
Whitelaw's warden-controlled flat.
She had phoned the station to say two youngsters had carried out a
burglary and got away with #6.
In her flat, Mrs Whitelaw showed the officer a roll of banknotes to
demonstrate what could have been taken.
Moments later he removed the money, the court heard.
Parfitt, of Hemel Hempstead, hid the cash in the toe of a boot in the
men's washroom at the police station.
It was still there the next day when police searched the station
following a second call from Mrs Whitelaw to say that more money had
gone missing from her flat.
Parfitt claimed he had been under stress due to a change of jobs and
two complaints being lodged against him.

AN industrial tribunal has ruled that a Scottish police force did not
sexually discriminate against a policeman by not letting him work the
same shifts as his wife.
Alexander Dunnet, of Fingal Avenue, Portree, Skye, who is now
stationed at Thurso, formerly worked as a policeman at Portree.
While stationed there he met WPC Audrey McKay and married her in
August 1994.
While at Portree both officers worked on the same shift, but they were
put on different shifts when they returned from honeymoon last
September.
PC Dunnet had asked for clarification of the force's policy on the
situation, and referred to Northern Constabulary's equal opportunities
policy, pointing out that there were precedents in the force of married
officers working on the same shift.
The tribunal noted that the force did not allow married officers in a
small station to work on the same shift because: ''It is a cardinal rule
of evidence in the law of Scotland that an accused person may be
convicted only, generally speaking, upon corroborated evidence.
''For that reason, police officers usually require to work in pairs.
Questions of credibility arise daily in trials in the criminal courts.
''The general objective of securing public confidence in the
administration of justice may not be achieved if a spouse officer or
another officer gives evidence in circumstances where it might be said
that the content of the evidence of that spouse officer owed more to an
obligation of loyalty to the spouse than to the truth.''
The constabulary pointed out that an officer could be ''over-zealous''
in a confrontation if he or she was married to the other officer
involved.
The tribunal added: ''The reasons for the practice adopted by the
respondents are sound reasons both from an operational and public
confidence standpoint.''
The tribunal noted that there had been occasions when married officers
had worked on the same shift but these were ''few and far between'' and
some of the examples were not comparable as the couples worked in a
large police station.
In dismissing PC Dunnet's case that he had been sexually discriminated
against because he was married, the tribunal stated: ''It was the
operational problem and matters affecting the public interest which
flowed from the relationship, and not his marital status, which was the
foundation of the decision which the respondents reached.''

THE rent is a king's ransom and the landlady is the Queen but this
residence at Hampton Court -- overlooking the former home of Henry VIII
-- is likely to be snapped up at a #400 a week. Laurel Cottage (2 bdrms,
receptn, kit, bthrm, gdns) will be advertised to let within 10 days, the
first of 60 royal properties to be leased out commercially to reimburse
the taxpayers.
Rents will go towards reducing grants paid from the public purse to
maintain the occupied royal palaces, such as Buckingham Palace and
Windsor Castle. Palace officials aim to reduce the Government's annual
grant from #20.5m to #15m by 2000. The former staff properties are all
on the edge of royal estates and outside police security cordons.

Other cakes affected were three from the Extremely Chocolatey range --
the Chocolate Covered Cake, 6 Milk Chocolate Mocha Fingers, and 6 Mini

A RECORD number of Glasgow businesses, shocked to see their rateable
values more than double in many cases, are lodging appeals against their
revaluation notices.
Their appeal deadline is Friday, but city assessors have already begun
to process 8819 letters. Several thousand remained unopened even as
another 3400 objections poured in yesterday.
It is clear that the 14,000 objections logged by Glasgow during the
previous revaluation exercise five years ago will be beaten. It is
likely more than one in two non-domestic ratepayers will appeal.
But Mr David Henry, president of the Scottish Assessors Association,
yesterday predicted that the number of appeals throughout Scotland was
likely to be down on that recorded in 1990.
He said that introduction of a unified business rate, plus phasing
arrangements or transitional relief announced by the Scottish Office,
should soften the impact of rises and would probably result in fewer
appeals.
The transitional scheme means that year-on-year increases will be
restricted to 10%.
However, Mr Bill Anderson, Scottish secretary of the Federation of
Small Businesses, urged: ''For God's sake, appeal . . . because you are
still being penalised.''
He insisted that there was still no ''level playing field'' between
Scottish and English rate bills, regardless of the new unified business
rate.
Examples cited included similar commercial properties in Harrogate and
Glasgow. While the former's rate bill had fallen from #2160 to #1750,
the Glasgow bill had increased from #4153 to #4564, 160% higher than its
English rival.
Mr Anderson argued that rateable values were higher in Scotland
because it had not suffered a property slump, and he warned that the
differentials would do ''exceptional damage'' to businesses north of the
Border in competition with English firms.
Mr Anderson, who recently met Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch
to complain at an apparent growing disparity between rate bills north
and south of the Border, believes the Government might have to
reintroduce industrial derating, which ended on April 1.
The closing date for commercial appeals in Strathclyde is Friday, but
for most of Scotland stands at September 30.
Borders Regional Council, where businesses face an average 32%
increase, could not rule out a record number of appeals. Last time
round, 25% of ratepayers objected. With almost three weeks to go, some
20% have submitted complaints.
In Tayside, a spokesman said that ''thousands'' had lodged objections.
Rateable values in its area are rising in real terms by about 50%.
There are more than 200,000 non-domestic properties in Scotland. They
face uplifts in rateable value ranging from minimal increases up to as
much as 150%. The average rise is about 32%.
Marks and Spencer -- whose store in Glasgow's Argyle Street has a
rateable value of #1,635,000 -- yesterday confirmed that it had lodged a
blanket appeal on behalf of all its Scottish concerns.

COUNCILLORS on Edinburgh's new unitary authority are set to differ on
smoking rules.
Staff and councillors from smoke-free Lothian region will have to
reach agreement with their more liberal counterparts at Edinburgh
District before the new administration takes over next April.
Existing policies mean regional workers wishing to smoke have to go
outside. District staff can use designated smoking areas within their
building.
Yesterday, the leader of Edinburgh District Council, where the new
administration will meet, predicted that smoking would be ''one of the
thorny issues''.
Non-smoking Councillor Lesley Hinds said: ''I think the new authority
will have to look at both policies and decide to compromise.''
Ms Hinds described smoking as ''a difficult subject'' and admitted
that there were arguments on both sides.
''Rooms make it easier for staff who do smoke to get the opportunity
to go away to smoke, leaving their colleagues behind to deal with
telephones and work,'' she said.
At Lothian region vice convener Brian Fallon, also a non-smoker,
played down the issue and maintained that there would be no
confrontation over cigarettes.
He said: ''The issue of smoking, either a total ban or partial ban, is
something which will have to be discussed. There are many more important
things to be decided by the new council before April 1.''
Councillor Susan Dalgety, a smoker who led the call for smoking areas
in the district council, said she expected strong support for such
facilities.
''There will be a big lobby looking for designated smoking areas,''
she said.
The district's Conservative group leader, Councillor Daphne Sleigh,
said she would also back the district policy.
''At the end of the day, it is so unattractive to go into a designated
smoking area that it might even act as a deterrent.''

THE manager of a children's nursery is to write to cereal maker
Kelloggs after finding a chocolate covered earwig while eating a
breakfast of Coco Pops.
Ms Alison Thomson, 29, found the insect in a bowl of cereal at the
nursery in Houston, Renfrewshire.
At first glance, Ms Thomson thought the earwig was a lump of
chocolate, but when she looked at it more closely she realised it was a
dead insect.
She said: ''I thought it was just a piece of chocolate, but after
closer inspection I was disgusted to find it was an earwig.''
Ms Thomson now plans to write to Kelloggs to complain about the
insect. It came from a CoCo Pops box which was part of a Variety Pack
containing eight different breakfast cereals, bought from Safeways,
Paisley.
She said: ''I'm absolutely furious about this. This is a nursery, and
there is a chance we could have given the Coco Pops and the earwig to
one of the children. I'm writing to Kelloggs to find out what it intends
to do about this. Obviously there's something wrong if a dead insect
gets into a box of cereal.''
A spokeswoman for Kelloggs said the company would carry out an inquiry
to find out how the earwig got into the cereal, which is made and
packaged at a plant in Manchester.

THE genteel world of Highland dancing has been sent reeling by a
furious row which has seen dark mutterings about vendettas and bogus
entry forms.
On the surface the event looked innocuous enough -- a dancing
competition which had been expected to attract 200 youngsters at this
year's Royal National Mod.
However, Mod organisers An Comunn Gaidhealach have called in lawyers
and banned the competition from being held as part of the official
programme at Golspie, Sutherland, next month.
Yesterday, the dance competition organisers, the Lewis Highland
Dancing Society, held a news conference in Stornoway and vowed to go
ahead regardless of An Comunn's support. The society also urged young
dancers around Scotland to tear up entry forms bearing the official Mod
logo and re-apply.
It had planned to put on the competition at Brora High School but will
now stage it at Dornoch Academy.
Society treasurer Lynn Maclean released a letter from the Mod office
in Golspie saying the society had no permission to use An Comunn's name
or to refer to the Mod at all. Mod secretary Kenny Maclean (no relation)
had ordered the society to stop sending out ''bogus'' entry forms.
Mrs Maclean said: ''We cannot understand why we have been dropped by
An Comunn when the association has supported the Highland dancing events
since 1989 when they were even included in the official Mod programme.''
But Mrs Maclean, who also released copies of lawyers' letters, would
not comment on suggestions that the ban was not entirely unconnected
with her husband Donnie Maclean's sacking as An Comunn's director last
year.
Earlier this year, an industrial tribunal ruled that he was unfairly
dismissed although his compensation was substantially cut because the
tribunal found Mr Maclean, 58, had contributed to the circumstances of
his sacking.
Asked if she felt there was a vendetta, she replied: ''I cannot
comment on that. It is up to people to make up their own minds.
''The original entry forms have now been withdrawn and new ones sent
out. The closing date for entries was September 30 but we will now have
to extend that deadline.''
She hoped the competitions would be included in next year's Mod at
Blairgowrie where the local committee had been most helpful.
However, An Comunn's chief executive, Mr Donald John MacSween, was
dancing to a different tune.
He said: ''At no time has An Comunn been approached about organising a
Highland dancing competition. Any use of the Mod logo or the Mod's name
will be slapped down, and rightfully so.
''It would not be right to let entrepreneurs just come in and organise
'official' competitions when the income is just going into their own
pockets.''
He added: ''It may be there might be such competitions in future, but
if so they will be organised by An Comunn and not by private
entrepreneurs.''

AUTHOR Salman Rushdie faced a small demonstration in Edinburgh last
night in the latest phase of his return to public life.
Hindus joined with Muslims to jeer him as he arrived at the Traverse
Theatre to give readings from his latest novel, The Moor's Last Sigh.
Passages from this are viewed as insulting by Hindus in the same way
as Satanic Verses outraged Muslims and led to a fatwa, or death
sentence, imposed by the Ayatollah Khomeni six years ago.
Mr Rushdie said he would be pressing the European Union to consider
imposing penalties on Iran to ''tighten the screw'' for the fatwa on him
to be lifted.
He was speaking after hearing from the Foreign Office that an Iranian
delegation had said last week that the fatwa would not be carried out.
He said: ''To my mind that will not do. At the very least what one
needs with people as unreliable as the Iranians are written and binding
commitments.''
Police outnumbered the 30 demonstrators at the Traverse Theatre. A
smiling Mr Rushdie was jeered as he waved to the crowd as he went in for
the readings with fellow novelist A S Byatt. It was his first public
appearance where several days notice had been given in advance.
Mr Yousaf Inait, convener of the Scottish Muslim Council for Religious
Affairs, said he would be writing to the Chief Constable of Lothian and
Borders Police asking how much security for the visit had cost and for
the bill to be sent to Waterstone's booksellers which had organised it.
''He has come to promote his book and make money for himself and his
publishers,'' Mr Inait said.
''Why should we as ratepayers pay for his protection when this is a
commercial venture?'' Mr Naren Sood, former chairman of Lothian Racial
Equality Council, said Mr Rushdie had made repeated and calculated
insults to both Hindus and Muslims.
''This has absolutely nothing to do with freedom of speech. He pitches
his so-called literature for Western audiences for his own
aggrandisement, in pursuit of personal publicity and personal profit,''
he said.
Mr Mohammed Aslam, secretary of the Pakistan Association in Edinburgh
and East of Scotland, said Mr Rushdie was not helping ethnic community
organisations in promoting racial harmony.

FEARS were growing last night for missing judge's daughter Anna Stott
and her 18-month-old child.
Mrs Stott, 20, has not been seen since Friday morning, when a
neighbour spotted her wheeling blonde-haired Katie from her
semi-detached home in a pushchair.
Although she is understood to have left behind a note, police are
worried because Mrs Stott took no change of clothes for her and Katie or
cash.
Mrs Stott is the daughter of Sheffield Crown Court judge Patrick
Robertshaw.
She moved with her self-employed builder husband Robert, 32, to their
new home in Darton, Barnsley, in June, from Huddersfield.
Yesterday her distraught husband made a desperate plea for her to come
home, or at least contact him.
Mr Stott said: ''Anna, please come home, or contact somebody, a
relative, a friend or the police. You have nothing to worry about.''
He added: ''I am appealing to anyone who has seen them or knows their
whereabouts to contact the police straight away.''
Police Sergeant Janet Skingle said: ''We are treating this very
seriously because she has gone missing with her baby and no-one has seen
her.
''A friend saw her the previous evening and everything seemed fine.
She even asked about babysitting arrangements.''
Inspector Barry Stones added: ''There may have been personal, domestic
and financial problems but there is nothing to suggest she would do
anything untoward.''

LABOUR councillors moved swiftly yesterday to keep the lid on a
simmering scandal in Glasgow over missing public funds.
They voted down a combined move -- by three Tory and Militant Labour
members -- to force council officials to return in a month's time to
give an updated report to the investigating committee and face further
questions.
Instead the matter will surface before the community action committee
only if there are considered to be ''developments'' to report.
Fraud Squad detectives have investigated the affairs of Cranhill
Community Council and three other local urban aid projects all in the
Easterhouse area for the past month.
Police were called in after city council auditors found missing
monies, incomplete records and, in one instance, an unjustified
''second'' bank account.
Militant Labour councillor Chic Stevenson first raised his concern in
letters to council officers last June. He now accuses the Labour
administration of being involved in a ''cover up'' by delaying action
into the scandal until after the May elections.
The Tory group leader, Councillor William Aitken, pointed out at
yesterday's meeting that the scale of the audit was relatively small. It
was, he said, into the affairs of a community project -- not into a huge
business corporation.
He asked: ''How can it take seven months to carry out an audit and
come up with a report?''
Mr Ian Drummond, the council's legal adviser, said the audit team set
up in January had considerable difficulty in extracting information.
''Additional matters then came to light and their investigation
widened,'' he said.
The auditors' findings were passed to senior members of the Labour
administration, he said, ''shortly before'' the matter was reported to
last month's committee meeting.
Councillor Stevenson said he was surprised that no-one was allowed to
name publicly the person at the centre of the police inquiries.
''I think this may have led to the matter not being pursued so
vigorously,'' he said.
''I would dispute that,'' answered Mr Drummond.

PARIS: French police failed for the second time in three days to
capture a top suspect in a wave of bombings when they cast a fresh
dragnet yesterday on suspected Muslim fundamentalists in Paris and
Grenoble. The fingerprints of Khaled Kelkal, 24, were found on a bomb
that failed to explode by a high-speed rail line. In Paris, police
arrested some 40 suspects after raids on dozens of homes as a security
crackdown continued.

A RUSSIAN MP said she was taking legal action against
ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky for assaulting her in a brawl in
Parliament.
Zhirinovsky seized Yevgenia Tishkovskaya round the neck and face and
tugged her by the hair during a tussle in the Duma, or lower house, on
Saturday.
The brawling, shown repeatedly by television channels, erupted during
an angry debate on Bosnia.
Tishkovskaya waded in to help an Orthodox priest, who had the cricifix
ripped from his neck in a scuffle with a right-wing MP. Soon, however,
she found herself grappling with Zhirinovsky.
Viewers saw him pull Tishkovskaya by the hand. When she landed a
punch, he seized her around the neck and twisted her face, dislodging
her glasses.
As she was being led away, Zhirinovsky reached out and seized her by
the hair. ''Get out of here, scum,'' he shouted.
She said she would ask the Duma to strip Zhirinovsky of his
parliamentary immunity and was seeking 100 million roubles (#14,000)
from him for ''insult and moral damage''.--Reuter.

A BRITISH hairdresser who married a Masai warrior she met on holiday
in Kenya delivered a protest note to the British embassy in Nairobi
today after his deportation from Britain last week.
Cheryl Mason, 35, who married 25-year-old Daniel Lekimencho in a blaze
of publicity on St Valentine's day, said she wanted an apology from the
government for the injustice against her husband.
''I am going to fight to put this situation right. I want an apology
from the British Government, I am a citizen,'' she told reporters and a
crowd of amused bystanders who gathered at the British High Commission.
The Home Office gave Mr Lekimencho until September 7 to leave the
country after refusing to renew his visitor's visa. He and Ms Mason
arrived back in Kenya on Friday.
''I am making an appeal to the British High Commission about the
injustice of my husband and the bad things said about our marriage. They
have put me in a category of tourists who come here and abuse Kenyan
men,'' said Ms Mason.
British High Commission officials said the mission had received her
protest note but declined to comment on the case.
The Home Office does not automatically grant residency to the spouses
of British citizens, especially in cases where it suspects the marriage
is not genuine.
Ms Mason, who has three children and has been married twice before,
met Mr Lekimencho two years ago on a package tour to Kenya where he
performed in a cultural group. She had left her children back home on
the Isle of Wight in the care of her husband Mike.
Within weeks of her return to Britain she took a flight back to Kenya
then returned home to tell him: ''It's over. I have found the man of my
dreams.''
At first the couple planned to live at Mr Lekimencho's home in
north-west Kenya. Three months later, however, they flew back to
London.--Reuter.

A CYPRUS court said today it would accept a policeman's evidence that
he had found a bloody palm print on a vehicle allegedly used by three
British soldiers accused of battering a Danish tour guide to death.
The Cyprus Assize Court decision ended four days of legal wrangling
after defence lawyers argued that the reference to blood was
prejudicial.
''The Assizes has not been convinced that striking this from court
records could affect a proper and fair trial,'' ruled court president
Judge Takis Eliades.
Justin Fowler, 27, Jeff Pernell, 23, and Alan Ford, 26, have denied
charges that they used an army shovel to bludgeon 23-year-old Danish
tour guide Louise Jensen to death.
The three, all members of the Royal Greenjackets, were arrested in a
yellow Mini Moke near their base at Dhekelia an hour after the woman
disappeared. Police say they were wearing bloodstained clothes.
Ms Jensen's body was found in a makeshift grave two days later.
Hearings continue next week. The accused remain in custody in the
capital Nicosia.
* Fifty British soldiers were today working to scoop up an oil slick
that landed on a popular Cyprus beach.
A British official said the slick on the Lady's Mile beach, west of
Limassol and located inside base territory, was about 870yd long.
The source of the oil was not known but ''most likely'' it was a ship
pumping out its bilges against international rules.
The soldiers, working by hand, were collecting the oil into plastic
bags ''before it can sink into the sand and become a long-term
nuisance'', the spokesman said.--Reuter/AP.

Witnesses said the gunman shouted ''Why did you do it?'' twice before
firing close to 20 bullets while repeatedly reloading the revolver.
Police said they were holding the gunman, who is in his early 20s.
Norwegian television showed court officials diving for cover in a room
with the shots ringing in the court entrance hall nearby.
NTB said the 46-year-old victim, a Norwegian of Egyptian origin, died
on the way to hospital. He had been due to stand trial on charges of
sexually abusing the 21-year-old daughter of his former common-law wife
for several years, since the girl was 14.

<HEADLINE>World Court urged to halt nuclear tests</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEW Zealand today told the World Court that earlier French nuclear
testing had so damaged the land beneath Mururoa Atoll that new tests
could cause ''a substantial escape of radioactive material''.
It asked the court in The Hague to order a halt to a new round of
nuclear blasts in the South Seas.
France broke a 22-year boycott of the UN court to defend itself.
New Zealand and France were summoned to explain their positions before
the judges rule whether to reopen New Zealand's 1973 case against French
nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
New Zealand's attorney general, Paul East, told the court that French
underground testing in the 1970s and 1980s caused so much damage to the
atoll's substructure that new testing could cause ''a substantial escape
of radioactive material and risk to the marine environment''.
''There is now reason to fear that these risks are substantially
higher than was previously believed to be the case,'' he said.
The first blast in the latest series planned by Paris provoked
international outrage and led to riots in Papeete, the capital of French
Polynesia.
East said the court provided the best hope of defusing the ''tension
and anger'' that had led to the Tahiti rioting.
''We are all looking to the Court as a legitimate legal avenue to stop
nuclear testing at Mururoa,'' he said.
New Zealand wants an emergency test ban while the case is being heard
by the World Court's 16 judges.
East said that international law ''places the onus of proof on France
to supply satisfactory evidence that this testing is safe''.
However, even if the court agrees to re-hear the case started in the
70s, and imposes an interim test ban until it rules, there is no
guarantee that France will honour such a ban.
France ignored a similar interim test ban in 1973, and began what
became a 22-year boycott of the court, which has no enforcement powers
and must rely on voluntarily compliance with its rulings.
PRIME Minister John Major has been pressed by the Kirk to break his
silence and publicly condemn the resumption of French nuclear testing.
The convener of the church and nation committee, the Rev Andrew
McLellan, has told him in a letter that if the Government continues to
say nothing, the UK will have been ''silently complicit'' in ''a sad,
destructive and painful story''.
The letter, a copy of which has also gone to Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind, expresses the hope that ''things are being said privately'' to
the French Government.
However it states that this would not be enough and urges: ''It is not
too late for the British Government to make clear and public its
condemnation of French actions.''

<HEADLINE>Women back down over sexual rights. Vatican and Iran win war of words</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976421107</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IRAN and the Vatican claimed victory today over a European bid to
enshrine ''sexual rights'' at the world women's conference.
The two groups of religious conservatives, representing Islam and the
Roman Catholic Church, forced EU delegates at the UN Fourth World
Conference on Women to back down on the wording in its final declaration
of so-called sexual rights of non-traditional families, such as single
parents or same sex parents.
However wrangling at the UN's biggest-ever conference over whether
parents should educate their children about sex delayed agreement on one
of the most contentious sections of the declaration.
Arguing late into the night behind closed doors, the delegates reached
a compromise to delete the EU-sponsored phrase ''sexual rights'' from
the draft Platform for Action. It could have been interpreted to include
non-traditional families, such as homosexual partnerships, and was
replaced by ''human rights''.
''It was Iran that caused the deletion of the phrase 'sexual rights'
from the document and the European Union was very much against this,''
said Iranian Vice President for Women's Affairs Shahla Habibi.
''They are going home empty-handed because of this deletion,'' she
said.
Critics of the European sexual-rights drive, including the Vatican,
attacked it for seeking to legitimise what they regard as immoral family
unions, including those of homosexual partners.
The delegation representing the Pope hailed as a turning point its
weekend broadside against wording which, it claimed, sought to roll back
parental rights, belittle motherhood, and undermine religious faith.
''The facts show that our decision to make public the situation with a
statement was right,'' said Vatican spokesman Joaquim Navarro-Valls.
Some sectors are still fighting on, however. James Morrow, a Scottish
priest attending as a journalist from the Scottish Catholic Observer,
said the Platform for Action was against Christianity.
''It omits four vital words -- God, husband, wife, and father. This is
a clear message from the United Nations that women who are discriminated
against get no recommendation to turn to their husband, father, or to
God for help. This is an attack on the family.''
The accord that lined up the Vatican and Iran in an informal alliance
against the EU over family rights still left other areas of dispute in
the draft declaration, such as parental responsibilities. This includes
the contentious issue of sex education.
However Gertrude Mongella, conference secretary-general, said
delegates were on track to have a declaration and platform for action
agreed by the end of the event on Friday.
''We are seeing a revolution taking place all around us,'' she said.
''Listening to speakers I am more convinced than ever that countries
are saying loudly and clearly: 'We want to resolve the problems of women
and to do that we must take action.' Everyone is looking for action.''

THIS is the week that General Colin Powell comes out of the closet.
The nearest thing we have to a real hero is selling his memoirs, but he
is also trying out the idea of running for president.
The book, of which excerpts appear in the current edition of Time
magazine, is appropriately coy about the general's political ambitions,
which means he is seriously thinking about his chances. He says he is
not comfortable in either political party, but leans to the Republicans,
and dislikes the two extremes.
The Democrats hope that if he makes a run for the presidency, he will
do so as an independent, a contingency the Republicans fear. A serious
third party candidate would certainly help President Clinton more than
the Republican candidate: Ross Perot sent Mr Clinton to the White House
by taking 19% of the votes in 1992, most of them from President Bush.
Increasing numbers of Republicans are therefore urging the general to
run as a Republican. It would cost a great deal of money, so he will
have to declare his candidacy soon. But he is so well known, and so
popular, that he would certainly do far better than most of the official
candidates, in far less time.
He might very well win the New Hampshire primary. The precedent
everyone is quoting is General Eisenhower's campaign in 1952. Ike
pretended to be uninterested, but won all the same, easily defeating
Senator Robert Taft, the party's favourite.
The Taft candidate today is Bob Dole. General Powell's supporters
argue that Mr Dole might win the nomination, but would lose the
election. The general, if he were nominated, would stand a good chance
of winning.
Could he win the nomination? After New Hampshire comes a whole series
of big states. Senator Dole has New York all locked up, Senator Gramm
will probably do well in Texas and the South. However there would be
plenty of room left for General Powell, especially if he had won in New
Hampshire.
As for running as a third party candidate, he might do as well, or
even slightly better, than Ross Perot: but it is most unlikely that he
could win. And if he did, he would be even less effective than Mr
Clinton or Mr Bush, trying to govern with Congress in the hands of the
opposition.

USING the ocean floor as a giant dustbin for low-level toxic waste
might not pose an intolerable threat, a marine expert said yesterday.
However, Dr Martin Angel, from the Institute of Oceanographic Studies,
told the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement
of Science at Newcastle University -- Britain's biggest showcase of
research and invention -- that Shell had picked the wrong site for its
aborted plan to dump the Brent Spar oil platform.
Instead of the 2000-metre deep site proposed, Dr Angel suggested a
site twice as deep out in the Atlantic south-west of Britain.
''It is possible that at 2000 metres they would have been putting it
on living resources,'' he said. ''But at 4000 metres there is no
biological connection between the surface and depths lower than 3000
metres.
Dr Angel admitted that the site he proposed, named Porcupine-Thistle,
was outwith Britain's own economic zone.
But he said: ''If you accept wiping out one per cent of the life on
the ocean floor in the Atlantic, that puts 90,000 square kilometres at
your disposal.
''If you are going to wipe out one per cent of the British ocean floor
that does not leave you many options.
''Although the matter needs more research, our knowledge has increased
substantially over the past 30 years.
''Greenpeace says it is ethically wrong to pollute the ocean floor. Is
it not unethical to pollute the land and the atmosphere?''
He pointed out that a lot of organic waste from landfill sites found
its way into the oceans of its own accord, leaching through the ground
into the rivers and out to sea.
''Good management is about how you put it on the ocean floor; we have
to look at whether it should be in containers to seal it.''
Dr Angel did not deny that some damage was bound to be done if the
ocean was used for dumping.
However, one of the problems about the threat to bio-diversity was
that if you scooped a sample of water from the deep ocean then --
getting down to the level of the smallest organisms, like nematodes --
you might find 100 different species in it.
''When you extrapolate that to the rest of the ocean we have to ask
ourselves whether we are interfering with the ecological systems that
keep the planet habitable.''
Dr Ward pointed out that the Atlantic was littered with the wreckage
of millions of tonnes of shipping sunk during the Second World War, each
equivalent to a Brent Spar.
He also suggested that sunken nuclear submarines, of which there were
several, could be used to monitor the spread of toxic waste through the
ocean by following the trail of radioactivity from their reactors.
''To understand the longer-term consequences of deep-sea dumping we
would have to run an experimental dump for 10 years. This would cost
#30-40m, but this would be offset by enabling us to dump one million
tonnes of waste as part of the trial.''
* The Prime Minister was accused of snubbing scientists by not
attending the meeting. Mr Major was invited in February to the festival,
but he declined, saying he was not due to be in Newcastle.
However, it emerged yesterday that he was in the city after all as
part of his autumn campaign.
Dr John Mulvey, executive secretary of the Save British Science
Society, said Mr Major's failure to make an appearance underlined the
Government's low regard for science.
''Even if Mr Major had just turned up for half-an-hour or an hour it
would have been a slap on the back,'' he said.
A spokesman at Conservative Central Office denied that the scientists
had been snubbed by Mr Major.
At the time the request was made in February there had been no plans
to do the trip, which was organised much later.

AL-FARAN guerrillas holding two Britons and two other Westerners
hostage in Kashmir are planning to stage a kidnapping in the Indian
capital over the next few days, officials say.
Authorities have intercepted radio messages from Al-Faran indicating
that the shadowy group might try to kidnap an Indian official or Western
diplomat by Friday.
Western embassies issued alerts to their nationals in New Delhi,
warning of a possible kidnap attempt and urging them to take extra
security precautions.
''The US embassy has received information that a terrorist group may
attempt to kidnap a Western diplomat or Indian Government official in
New Delhi during the next 10 days,'' said American officials.
At least one mission contacted prominent companies warning them of the
security threat.
One diplomat said his embassy was considering replacing special
diplomatic licence plates so envoys' cars would be harder to identify.
Al-Faran is holding Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, American
Donald Hutchings, and German Dirk Hasert.
American John Childs was captured on July 4 with Hutchings, Mangan and
Wells, but escaped four days later. On the same day, Al-Faran abducted
Hasert and Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, who was found beheaded on
August 13.--Reuter.

THE judge in the O J Simpson murder trial ruled today that a key
prosecution witness, detective Mark Fuhrman, could not be forced to give
further testimony.
However Judge Lance Ito granted the football legend's defence team
permission to appeal against his decision.
Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the murders in June last year of his
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Simpson's lawyers have painted Fuhrman, who has refused to testify
further, as a rogue, racist cop who planted a bloodstained glove on
Simpson's estate to frame the black sports hero.
In a day of fast-moving developments, lawyer Johnnie Cochran said the
defence was not in a position to rest and told the judge he had a
mystery witness who would contradict portions of Fuhrman's testimony.
''There is a critical witness in this case who shall remain
nameless,'' Cochran said, but gave no details of the testimony the
witness would provide.
He added: ''We may want to call him (Fuhrman) back for further
impeachment.''
After a morning session without the jury present, Ito brought the
panel into court and told them that because of the ''unusual and unique
legal issues, I am not going to require the defence at this time to
rest''.
Over the objections of lead prosecutor Marcia Clark, Ito ordered the
prosecution to begin its rebuttal phase.
Clark responded by bringing on a string of witnesses who testified to
photographing Simpson at work as a commentator on National Football
League games wearing gloves which looked the same as those used in the
murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
Earlier, in response to a defence motion, Ito said he would not strike
Fuhrman's testimony of how he found a bloodstained glove on Simpson's
estate the morning after the football legend's ex-wife and her friend
were murdered. He also turned down a defence request that he instruct
the jury to forget the glove had ever been found.
Simpson's defence also lost its fight to have the jury hear more
recordings taped before the murders in which Fuhrman frequently uses the
racial epithet ''nigger'' and boasts about planting and manufacturing
evidence.
Fuhrman had testified that he had not used the racial slur in the last
10 years.--Reuter.

A SCOUT leader who admitted four sex attacks on boys from his troop
over a three-year period was yesterday warned that he could face a jail
sentence.
Peter Atkins, 25, of Steele Avenue, Dalkeith, Midlothian, admitted
charges of sexual assault involving teenage boys when he appeared at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Deferring sentence for background reports until October 2, Sheriff
Iain Macphail heard how Atkins was originally granted bail with a
condition that he did not become involved with youth groups.
The sheriff warned: ''I must emphasise that bail being continued does
not mean that the court has ruled out a custodial sentence. These
charges involved a very serious breach of trust.''
The court was told that Atkins preyed on the youngsters when he was an
assistant Scout leader.
Depute-fiscal Pamela Watson said that the boys, aged 13, 14, 16, and
17, were all wakened by Atkins touching them through their sleeping bags
or underwear.
She described how one of the youngsters had gone on a camping trip
with Atkins to Dumfriesshire, but said the trip was cut short when he
was molested on the first night.
The teenager locked himself in Atkins's car for the rest of the night
and demanded he drove them both home the next morning.
The court heard how another of the victims could not bring himself to
talk about his ordeal for two months before confiding in his sister. She
confronted Atkins, but he denied everything.
Another youngster was said to have slapped Atkins's hand away to find
him touching him again a short time later.
The youngest boy was said to have displayed behavioural problems for
about a year after the assault and his mother eventually contacted
police.
0 Mrs Watson said another victim had felt unable to go to the
authorities.
''He didn't think he could go to them because Atkins was a
well-respected figure and he didn't think anyone would believe what had
happened,'' she said.
Defending, advocate Mr Raj Jandoo said Atkins was ''deeply sorry''
about the offences. He had sought psychiatric help from his own GP
before matters came to light.

GENETIC sequencing of viruses is being used to pin the blame on HIV
patients who have infected their partners.
Dr Paul Harvey, an Oxford University zoologist, said constructing a
virus family tree could locate the virus most closely related to that of
the victim.
''We can now compare the genetic sequence of the victim's viruses with
those of possible suspects and determine where the virus comes from,''
he said.
One case was called off just as it was to go to court when it was
discovered that the person being sued was not the one who had passed on
the infection.
Similar research had shown that hepatitis C, the biggest source of
fatal liver disease, had been spreading through blood transfusions and
other routes for nearly 40 years before it was isolated and identified
in 1989.

<HEADLINE>Pension poverty fears for women</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976421131</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PLANS to equalise the pensionable age by raising it to 65 for women
will drive them further into a poverty trap, according to the Economic
and Social Research Council.
Professor Sara Arber, a sociologist from Surrey University, said that
only a quarter of women aged 60 to 64 were working.
Those without a husband or surviving share of his occupational pension
would find themselves depending on income support.
Even an occupational pension -- either their own or their husband's --
might do little more than render them ineligible for income support, and
all the attendant benefits like housing benefit, she said.
Research carried out by Professor Arber for the ESRC showed that,
currently, the average weekly income for older women was #61, less than
two-thirds that of men, at #106.
''This difference is caused mainly by the effects of occupational
pension income, which is closely linked to type of occupation,
employment pattern, and lifetime earnings,'' said Professor Arber.
Older British women were far less likely than men to receive any
income from an occupational pension, and the amounts were also less,
because of the effects of child care and household work on women's
employment history.
This pattern was unlikely to change -- even though more women were
working than ever -- by the year 2010, when the pension age is raised to
65.
In 1991, just 24% of women aged 40 to 59 belonged to an occupational
pension scheme. Most women continued to interrupt their employment to
have children, and usually cashed in any occupational pension they had
at the time.
Having children was the major factor influencing whether women in
mid-life had an occupational pension.
''Current public policy has promoted private pension through
incentives, while allowing the value of State pensions to fall,'' said
Professor Arber.
Whereas the State pension was worth 20% of average earnings in 1980,
it has fallen to just more than 16%, and is expected to fall to 10% by
2010.
But she pointed out: ''Only half of widows older than 65 have a
surviving share of their husband's occupational pension. The overall
value, on average, is #10 a week.
''For many women, who neverthess pay into occupational or personal
pension plans on the assumption that they are providing for their old
age, the reality will be that they are no better off.
''The small amounts of pension accumulated will just take them above
the benefit threshold.
''It is a pension trap. Current Government policies will result in
large numbers of older women in poverty and dependent on state
benefits,'' she said.

TWO waitresses told an industrial tribunal yesterday that they had
been shocked and upset by racist jokes told by comedian Bernard Manning
when they worked at a Round Table dinner.
They claimed 500 men in a plush hotel banqueting suite roared with
laughter as the comic told jokes about the Ku Klux Klan.
Freda Burton, 24, and Sonia Rhule, 31, both of Derby, are claiming
compensation from the management of the Pennine Hotel, Derby, for
alleged racial discrimination.
The tribunal heard that when the two waitresses went in to clear the
tables, Manning made them the butt of jokes.
Mrs Burton told the Nottingham tribunal that Manning made racist and
sexual comments when she dropped a cup and bent to pick it up.
She also claimed the two women were harassed by four guests. One of
them made a sexual remark to Mrs Rhule.
Mrs Burton said: ''She was so upset, she could hardly speak at first.
She asked him to repeat what he had said and he did.''
Then his friend said they had paid money to go to a function which had
been a poor night. He said they wanted to have some fun with the
waitresses.
He told her: ''You are a nobody, just a waitress''.
She said: ''At this stage I could take no more and left the function
room to find the manager to complain.
''I became aware that the banqueting manager was standing by the bar
and Sonia had already told him what had happened. The hotel manager took
no steps to stop the abuse.''
Macbool Javaid, solicitor for the Commission for Racial Equality,
which brought the case, told the hearing: ''These ladies were exposed to
the venom and racism of a comedian . . . without anyone intervening.
''They were subjected to some of the most wild racist abuse
imaginable. The employers ought to have seen the likelihood of this
happening and taken appropriate action.''
Hotel manager Andrew Pemberton told the tribunal the Round Table was
more to blame than Manning.
''I took the view that the complaint was not so much against Mr
Manning but more against members of the Round Table,'' he said.
''The contents of the letter the girls wrote to me were quite
shocking. I was horrified.''
Mr Pemberton said the Round Table had tried to book the hotel's
function room, called the Derwent Room, again this year but he refused
to have them.
The case has been adjourned until November 1 when a judgment will be
announced.

ROSS and Cromarty District Council has agreed to pay a consultancy
firm to advise its chief executive on how to find a new job.
The move has infuriated one councillor, who said any such offer should
be extended to everyone facing redundancy in the run-up to the unitary
Highland Council.
A private meeting of the policy and resources committee yesterday
agreed to pay up to #5000 for a firm to advise Mr Rory Mair after he
indicated his intention to leave local authority employment by April
1996.
However, Councillor Douglas Briggs dissented, and after the
closed-doors meeting said he had received the backing of only one other
councillor, Mr David Philip.
He said: ''This is a misuse of public money. If this is being offered
to one member of staff, it should be extended to all the others who face
redundancy or voluntary severance in the run-up to the unitary Highland
Council.
''If this was offered to everyone else, it would have major cost
implications for the council.''
Mr Mair denied there was anything underhand or unusual in the move.
He said: ''I and another two senior officials have said that our
probable careers lie outwith local government. Only 15 out of 60
existing local government chief executives have found jobs with the new
authorities.
''The Society of Local Authority Chief Executives has negotiated a
low-cost package with a management consultancy firm, and they have
agreed to help any local government chief executive in Scotland to plan
their future career. I put this to the councillors, and they have agreed
to finance it.''

<RECORDNO>976421134</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ONE of Britain's youngest and most dangerous criminal masterminds was
jailed for 24 years at the Old Bailey yesterday for a catalogue of armed
robberies and escape.
James Doyle, 31, grinned as he was led to cells from a courtroom
guarded by armed police.
He was convicted of armed raids on banks and building societies
between 1991 and 1992.
Each was meticulously planned. ''They were executed with something
akin to military efficiency,'' Judge Nina Lowry told Doyle, whom she
described as a ''very dangerous criminal''.
Doyle's gang terrorised cashiers and customers at his numerous
targets. His ''tactics of surprise and speed were nearly always
successful. It was very difficult for police to discover who was
responsible,'' said the judge.
Police believe Doyle carried out 104 raids over a four-year period --
the longest string of robberies on their records in this country --
which netted hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Even after Doyle and his gang members were finally caught red-handed
in an armed police ambush during an extensive Flying Squad operation, he
engineered a daring escape before his trial.
Doyle was taken by prison officers to Moorfields Hospital in London to
see a consultant about a permanent eye problem. He had been there before
and knew the layout.
He asked to use the lavatory. Once inside, a masked gunman burst in,
forced the officers to the floor and ordered them to release Doyle from
handcuffs. He fled to Ireland, but was extradited.
Doyle spent much of his spoils on himself. He loved high-living and
took the same pride in his designer clothes as he did in drafting and
organising his crimes.
His calculations even included counting the seconds if and when an
alarm went off so that the robbers could escape before help arrived.
''There are a number of features in this case which make it
exceptionally grave. The robberies were ruthless and people were put
into dreadful fear,'' said Judge Lowry.
The judge commended Detective Inspector Bob Berger and his team of
Flying Squad officers for their ''hard and long work on a difficult and
complex case concerning a very dangerous criminal''.
All of Doyle's men, totalling six or seven, were friends living in the
same north London area. They drew on an arsenal of weapons and live
ammunition stored in safe deposit boxes later discovered by police.
The gang was finally smashed by Operation Crozon which had employed up
to 150 officers to track down Doyle by studying his methods and targets.
Doyle was also finally caught red-handed on film. A camera crew was
shooting a documentary -- Scotland Yard -- for independent television at
the scene of the ambush -- outside a bank in Harrow, north London.
It was used in court to help convict Doyle, of Wembley, of conspiracy
to rob, which he denied.
Mr Berger said later: ''No other team have committed that number of
robberies that we know about.''
Tight security surrounded Doyle's eight-week trial. The jury had
police protection throughout. Armed police patrolled outside the locked
courtroom.
Doyle's gang's main hallmark was the choice of their getaway car --
nippy and unobtrusive Vauxhall Astras, the jury were told.
All of his men were firm friends. ''They went on holiday together and
were a closely knit unit -- an essential quality for a group of young
men who decided to try their hands at armed robbery,'' said Jonathan
Laidlaw, prosecuting.
Doyle, a bachelor, was described by police as a dangerous
professional. ''If cornered, I am sure he would not think twice about
pulling the trigger,'' said Mr Berger.
Doyle's gang opened fire on a police motorcyclist as they escaped from
their penultimate robbery. Police constable Eric Coppin spotted their
car making an illegal U-turn as they sped away. Five shots were fired,
but no-one was injured.
The gang escaped -- but left behind vital evidence -- empty bullet
shells and clothing. They made another mistake when the second getaway
car they were using was given a parking ticket. It was traced back to
one of the gang.
The breakthrough came when one of the gang was filmed without his
balaclava mask outside one bank target and was recognised as Doyle, who
had previous convictions for robbery and violence.

AN alien weed which wrecks wild brown trout fisheries and poses a
threat to other freshwater life has been discovered in the Western Isles
for the first time.
Scottish Natural Heritage scientists confirmed yesterday that Canadian
pondweed had been found in Loch nam Faolieann, near Daliburgh, in South
Uist.
It is the first such sighting in the Outer Hebrides of the invasive
weed. Its rapid growth not only starves the water of oxygen but chokes
the native plants on which aquatic life, a food source for trout,
thrives.
John Love, South Uist SNH officer, said it was not known how the
pondweed reached the isles.
One theory was that the plant -- commonly sold for aquaria, including
goldfish bowls -- was dumped inadvertently into the loch by a pet owner.
The machair lochs of the Uists provide ideal growing conditions for
the weed. It can be transferred easily from water to water on the feet
or feathers of birds and survive several days out of water.
So far, the weed is contained to one loch, but locals are being urged
to stay alert.
Mr Love said that SNH was looking at ways to eradicate the pondweed,
discovered during a national survey of plantlife in Britain's freshwater
lochs.

As the level of carbon dioxide rises, the rate at which the fruit
respires slows down.
Mr Sainsbury said research was establishing the precise conditions
required to control the respiration rate of each fruit variety.
To put theory into practice, the fruit would be placed in sealed
refrigerated transit containers equipped with reservoirs of oxygen and
carbon dioxide.
Gas levels would be computer controlled.
Mr Sainsbury said: ''This technology not only extends the life of the
fruit by up to six weeks, enabling the more cost-effective form of
transport by sea, but also extends the season of availability, making
good-eating, quality fruit available for extended periods at reasonable
cost.''

PREGNANT brides need no longer have any fears about walking down the
aisle.
The first white wedding maternity dress to save the bride's blushes
went on display yesterday at the annual bridal fair in Harrogate,
Yorkshire.
Model Donna Carter, 30, stuffed padding up the front of the silk
dupion gown to fake an eight-month pregnancy.
''It's a beautiful dress and very elegant, and it feels very
comfortable,'' she said.
Orders have been flooding in to the maker, Ellis Bridals, of Wood
Green, north London, at its stand at the Harrogate fair, which attracts
buyers worldwide.
Designer Jennie Andrews, 28, said: ''This is the first year a dress
for pregnant brides has gone on the market.
''There was that gap in the market for maternity wedding dresses. It
is only fair that pregant brides should have a beautiful dress. After
all they are blooming.
''It is a sign of the times. Being unmarried and pregnant is no longer
a taboo, and churches are now allowing marriages to take place when the
bride is obviously pregnant.''
A Harrogate minister, the Rev Martin Short, said more and more brides
were getting married when pregnant.
''The church continues to look after and marry people, whether or not
they follow the Christian ideal, and everyone who lives in England is
entitled to be married in the local parish church.''

A MAN was given four life sentences yesterday for a sex attack on a
12-year-old girl who was kept captive and forced inside a suitcase.
Brett Mills, 34, of Croydon, who the judge recommended should serve a
minimum of 18 years, has cost the taxpayer more than #1m as he tried to
beat the legal system.
Relatives of the girl, who moved from her home and school after the
attack in March last year, applauded as Mills was led to the cells at
the Old Bailey.
Seconds later, through the padded dock door, Mills could be heard
screaming and shouting obscenities.
He had lured the girl from West Croydon railway station in London to
his nearby flat and kept her captive overnight.
He beat her, stripped her naked, forced her into a suitcase, and took
her to his girlfriend's where he raped her.
Judge Richard Lowry said Mills had shown no remorse and no insight
into the physical and mental suffering he inflicted on his young victim.
''You behaved with ruthless selfish cruelty. You inflicted dreadful
suffering on this young girl of 12 and the effect on her has been
appalling.
''Before this event she was a little young for her age, a follower
rather than a leader, but a normal happy child,'' the judge said.
He said Mills had forced the girl to relive her ordeal by giving
evidence twice and her condition as now reported by her mother ''makes
the saddest possible reading''.
Although the girl's condition might improve, the judge said: ''The
memories can never be expunged.''
Afterwards, the victim's grandfather praised Judge Lowry's handling of
the case and for tolerating insults which Mills repeatedly hurled at
him.
Mills dismissed six sets of solicitors and counsel during the course
of the case, causing a first trial at the beginning of the year to be
halted after the girl's evidence when he sacked his legal team.
When the second trial started, she again had to face the ordeal of
giving evidence.
During that trial Mills sacked his final set of lawyers and defended
himself.
He tried to abort the trial by slashing his stomach with a razor blade
which he had smuggled into the dock. The wound was only superficial and
the trial continued after a short adjournment.
Throughout the trial Mills tried to insinuate the girl had encouraged
him and consented to what occurred.
Yesterday, as the judge described the agonies the defendant had
subjected her to, Mills shouted from the dock: ''That's rubbish.''
Mills also refused to mitigate fully on his own behalf saying: ''I
shouldn't get a sentence, I shouldn't have been found guilty. I proved
my innocence all the way through the trial.''
He had accused the girl, the court, and the police of ''fitting me
up''.
Mills, with previous convictions for dishonesty and violence, was told
by the judge ''the story of this case beggars belief''.
Charges against Mills's then girlfriend, Susan Bailey, of Thornton
Heath, south London, of aiding and abetting the attack on the
schoolgirl, which she denied, were dropped by the prosecution and formal
not guilty verdicts entered.

A BRIDE was left sitting alone at her wedding reception after her
groom was ejected, a court heard yesterday.
But worse was to come when Lorna Webster, 28, learned that her husband
of a few hours had been stabbed 10 times by his brother.
She was left behind when stewards threw her husband John Leonard, 31,
off the Tuxedo Princess disco boat on the Clyde in Glasgow.
A row between John and his brother Stephen, 28, of Aberfeldy Street,
Dennistoun, Glasgow, continued after John was ''put ashore'', the High
Court in Glasgow heard.
Stephen Leonard yesterday admitted seriously assaulting his brother to
the danger of his life and permanent impairment by punching, kicking,
and repeatedly stabbing him.
Later on the night of the stabbing doctors carried out an emergency
heart operation on John in a ward at the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow.
Advocate-depute Valerie Stacey, prosecuting, said: ''It was discovered
he had a wound to his heart and surgeons could not wait to get him to
the operating theatre and had to perform an operation in the ward.''
Solicitor advocate Robert McCormack, defending, said: ''After the
groom was ejected from his reception, the row continued later and John
grabbed Stephen by the throat.
''Stephen lashed out with the knife at his brother with an almost
fatal result. Both brothers now regret what happened.''
Lord Weir heard the brothers had not been in contact since the
incident and he deferred sentence for three weeks.

THE 47th annual Emmy Awards made it a good year for doctors on
television, with programmes such as ER, Frasier, and Chicago Hope taking
the biggest awards on Sunday night.
ER, the drama about life and death in a Chicago-area hospital
emergency room, won top honours in American television's version of
film's Academy Awards -- for best directing, writing, and supporting
actress.
However, it lost out to rival hospital drama Chicago Hope, in the best
actor category, and also failed to win best drama. That accolade went to
ABC's NYPD Blue, giving the controversial police series a total of three
awards overall.
Making a rare appearance, Barbra Streisand won five Emmys, including
three technical awards, for Barbra Streisand The Concert, and Glenn
Close won best actress in a television movie for Serving in Silence: The
Margarethe Cammermeyer Story.
NBC's Frasier, a comedy based on a call-in psychiatrist show, grabbed
five awards, including best actor for former Cheers star Kelsey Grammer,
best supporting actor, and best comedy series.
ER's eight Emmys tied Hill Street Blues for the most awards in a
single season and the most awards for a series in its first season. With
Frasier, it gave NBC 28 awards overall, more than any other network.
Among the major categories, Mandy Patinkin, star of Chicago Hope, won
for best drama actor, while Kathy Baker, who plays Dr Jill Brock in the
CBS series Picket Fences, won her second Emmy for best drama actress.

<TEXT>
THE family of teenager Stephen Lawrence last night said it wished to
keep the prosecution of his alleged killers private.
The decision to resist Crown Prosecution Service ''interference'' was
announced after a ruling at Belmarsh Magistrates Court, south-east
London, to commit two men charged with Stephen's murder to a trial
before an Old Bailey jury.
Family and supporters of the Lawrences, who have attended each day of
the four-week hearing, hissed ''Yes'' when stipendiary magistrate David
Cooper ruled that Neil Acourt, 20, and Luke Knight 18, would be
committed for trial.
The two men, both from Eltham, south-east London, were released on
conditional bail after the hearing.
Two other men, also facing murder charges, were discharged earlier
this week.
The case brought by the Lawrences is only the fourth private murder
prosecution in 130 years.
Their decision to prosecute was made when the CPS dropped charges
against two young men a few months after Stephen -- an A-level student
who dreamed of becoming an architect -- was stabbed to death at a bus
shelter in April 1993.
After telling of the ''tremendous obstacles'' the family had overcome
to reach this stage, Stephen's mother Doreen told gathered newsmen: ''No
family should ever have to experience the last two years of our lives.
''This is the worst kind of fame. We have been brought into the public
spotlight, not by our own acts, but by the failure of others who were
under a public duty to act.
''The decision of the court today stands as the first clear indictment
of that failure.''
In a statement, the CPS said: ''We will not take over a private
prosecution simply because it has been committed to crown court, but we
will reconsider the case in the light of the evidence aired at the
committal and any representations from the parties involved.''
The Lawrence's lawyer, Mr Imran Khan, said that, once the case had
started, the prosecution had been offered no assistance and no
representations were made during the course of the hearing, despite an
earlier ruling to do so by the magistrate.
The two men released earlier this week were Jamie Acourt, 19, Neil's
brother, and David Norris, 19.
A fifth man, Gary Dobson, 19, also of south-east London, is due to
make a second appearance before Greenwich magistrates after he was
arrested for murder as a result of the private prosecution.

IRISH development chiefs conceded last night that Scotland appeared to
have succeeded in its bid to bring a Taiwanese screen manufacturer, 3000
jobs, and #750m of investment to Mossend, Lanarkshire.
Ireland was believed to be the only other country being seriously
considered by the Chungwha Picture Tube Company, a subsidiary of Tatung,
as a site for a new electronics plant.
Officials of the Irish Industrial Development Authority admitted they
would be surprised if the Taiwanese did not come to Scotland.
Officially, the authority would only say: ''We are in discussion with
the company, but we can't say any more than that.'' However, a senior
source admitted: ''We don't have a good track record in Taiwan and have
never succeeded there. The Taiwanese seem to have enormous loyalty to
the United Kingdom in general.
''If we did land this it would be a major breakthrough, but nobody
here is getting excited about it. Scotland is very much the front
runner.''
One of the reasons given for the Scots' apparent success is support
for the bid from the highest level. Neither the UK nor Ireland recognise
the Taiwanese government and both officially back Chinese claims of
sovereignty.
The Scots bid has been enhanced by the inclusion of Industry Minister
George Kynoch in negotiations in Taiwan.
He said yesterday that although Scotland was the only UK location
being considered, other countries were still being looked at.
Locate in Scotland said in a statement: ''We can confirm we are in
discussions with Chungwha Picture Tube Company. The company are moving
closer to making a decision and as a result of our discussions so far,
they narrowed their UK options and Scotland is the only UK option they
are considering. They are, however, still considering other European
locations.''
The decision by Chungwha to come to Mossend would be the biggest
inward investment in the country's history. A decision is expected in
six weeks.

Brussels
AN unusually conciliatory tone on Europe was set yesterday by Mr Roger
Freeman, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Cabinet Minister
in charge of dealing with the European Union on deregulation.
Mr Freeman, who works for the pro-European deputy prime minister, Mr
Michael Heseltine, on industrial competitiveness, went as far as to
praise Mr Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, for his
call yesterday at the TUC for more consultation in the business world.
At the same time, he refused to criticise Mr Santer's passionate
championing of the proposed single European currency. The point had not
been discussed, he said.
Mr Freeman is the first Cabinet Minister to visit Brussels since Tory
Euro-sceptics were rebuffed by Mr Major's defeat of Mr John Redwood in
this summer's leadership challenge.
In contrast to some Cabinet Ministers, whose visits to Brussels are
marked by hostile comments, Mr Freeman said: ''I am taking a
constructive attitude. I am not going to hector or lecture the other
member states.''
But he would not be drawn on whether his style reflected a sea change
in Government attitudes to Europe, which are currently threatening the
survival of the divided Conservative Party.
At the start of a tour of all other 14 EU member states to discuss
regulatory reform and improved competitiveness as a means of improving
employment, Mr Freeman held talks with senior European Commission
officials and European employers.
He said he hoped this process would conclude -- at the Madrid summit
in December -- with consolidation, review, and perhaps removal of some
unnecessary EU directives which hampered business. The Government will
spell out its suggestions in detail next month.
Examples of industries which should gain from the British initiative
include those in biotechnology, food hygiene, and labelling, Mr Freeman
said.
''We are not asking for withdrawal of environmental or social
legislation, which is put in place and which I know is firmly embedded
in the attitude and approach of other member states,'' he promised.
However, he insisted that business wanted clarity and certainty.
Asked his reaction to Mr Santer's call for a fresh momentum in talks
between European employers and trade unions, and an improved social
dialogue, Mr Freeman said: ''It must be right that we consult widely. I
am not in favour of simply consulting business representatives.''
He added: ''Good consultation makes good law. I think President Santer
is absolutely right to call for fewer regulations, and the way to do
this is to consult properly.''

A FURIOUS reaction last night greeted the announcement that a 47-pupil
primary in the Stirling constituency of Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth is to become the second opted-out school in Scotland.
Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson yesterday confirmed
during a visit to Scotland's first self-governing school, Dornoch
Academy in Sutherland, that St Mary's primary in Dunblane would opt out
next month.
St Mary's parents voted for self-governing status more than two years
ago because they were opposed to Central region's plans for the
150-year-old Episcopalian school.
But opting out was delayed because of a dispute about the future of
the building which was resolved when the school's Episcopalian trustee
approved its sale.
The parent-dominated board of management which will take over the
running of St Mary's will receive a grant -- estimated at about #100,000
-- from the Scottish Office to buy the building.
More funding will be needed to upgrade the school, which has no staff
room and an outside toilet for boys.
Mrs Maria Fyfe, MP for Maryhill, who speaks on Scottish education for
Labour, said: ''A #100,000 grant from the Scottish Office is totally
indefensible. Other children's school books are falling apart and water
is coming through classroom ceilings.
''Is Michael Forsyth that desperate? This will be only the second
opt-out in six years of trying to persuade parents along a path they
have rejected.''
Central region's deputy leader, Councillor Tom Coll, said it was
''nonsensical'' to spend large sums of money on St Mary's when a
state-of-the-art #3m primary was to open in Dunblane next year.
It would be more than capable of accommodating St Mary's pupils, he
said.
The region's acting director of education, Mr Graeme Young, questioned
the viability of allowing a small primary school to ''go it alone'',
with funding being provided directly by the Scottish Office.
Only three pupils started in primary one at the beginning of the
school session last month, he said.
''I would hope that parents realise the difficulties involved in
keeping a school this size up and running and that large amounts of
public money will have to be used to meet this cost.
''Already the running cost per pupil is almost double in St Mary's
compared to an average primary in the region. Money will also have to be
spent on the building itself and the cost may have to be met in time by
the new Stirling unitary authority,'' Mr Young said.
He warned that parents in a self-governing school would lose out on
resources which council-run schools enjoyed such as psychological,
advisory, and special educational needs services.
The roll has fallen from about 60 pupils but school board chairman
Alan Bateman said he hoped it could ''creep back up again''.
Mr Bateman, who has one child at St Mary's, said he was ''very
pleased'' that the opting-out application had been granted. He said:
''Our priority is to make space for a bursar. Then we can stand back and
decide what we need to do with the school.''
Central region had estimated that upgrading the school would cost
about #300,000, a figure which Mr Batemen disputed. He thought the
school would cost less than #100,000 to buy, but declined to be more
specific.
The Scottish Office said any application for capital grant to
refurbish St Mary's would be considered. An official could not provide
any information about the cost of buying the building.
At Dornoch Academy, Mr Robertson said self-governing status had
enabled the school to spend more on books and equipment by making
savings on energy and other costs.
Parents, staff, and the community had a more direct and immediate say
in how the school was run, he said.
But Golspie High parents, who are deeply concerned about the impact on
local education of allowing Dornoch Academy to become a six-year
secondary, criticised Mr Robertson for declining to travel the 11 miles
from the opted-out school to hear about their worries.
Mr Robertson said it would have been ''extraordinarily arrogant'' of
him to encourage schools to opt out without seeing at first hand a
self-governing school in operation.
He said: ''I have invited the Golspie people to come and see me and
talk about anything they want.''
The chairwoman of Golspie High school board, Mrs Christine Port, said:
''We are opposed to Dornoch upgrading because there is already a surplus
of school places in Sutherland. If the six-year upgrading is granted it
will have very serious consequences for local authority schools, in
particular Golspie.''
Dornoch Academy currently provides education for first and second year
pupils. Its roll has fallen by 35% since opting out but Mr Robertson was
confident that it would recapture the pupils it had lost after the
current uncertainty about upgrading to six-year status had been
resolved. Proposals to upgrade are out for consultation.

A FIVE-year-old boy with behavioural problems has been expelled from
school after nine days.
Shaun Murray was ousted from his Primary One class at Trinity Primary
School, Edinburgh, for what education chiefs have called ''disruptive
behaviour''.
Last night his father Steven, 31, was attempting to have his son
reinstated, saying Shaun had deep-rooted behavioural problems and lacked
the ability to concentrate.
Teachers said Shaun's constant chattering and refusal to stay in his
seat distracted other children in his class and affected their studies.
Mr Murray, a single parent of Leith, near Edinburgh, said: ''Sean's a
great kid. He does get out of hand at times, but that's not his fault.
''He just can't concentrate. His mum and I split up in the past year
and that's really affected him, and he's also had to battle against a
really nasty type of eczema. It's no wonder the wee lad has got
problems.''
Mr Murray said he first noticed Shaun's lack of concentration when he
was at nursery in Janaury.
''The nursery got Shaun a child psychologist who told me my son might
need an auxiliary teacher to sit with him at the school and help him get
together again.
''I was told it had all been arranged, but when he started school his
headmistress said she knew nothing about it.''
Within nine days of Shaun starting at the primary school, Mr Murray
was summoned to see the head teacher, Miss Isobel Hall, and told he must
take his son out of the school.
''I was so angry,'' Mr Murray said. ''Surely teachers are meant to
give extra help to children like Shaun, not throw them out?
''Shaun doesn't understand why he's now stuck in the house and not at
school with the rest of his pals.
''I've had to tell him he's not at school because he's got a cold but
I can't keep telling him that forever.''
Shaun, cuddling his three-year-old sister Ashley, said: ''I love
school and I'm missing my friends. But I'm going back once my cold is
better.''
Last night Colin Dalrymple, of Lothian Regional Council's Education
Department, confirmed Shaun's expulsion.
''A meeting is to be held imminently with Mr Murray and
representatives of the Education Department and the school,'' Mr
Dalrymple said.
''Our prime concern is what is best for Shaun. It would be jumping the
gun to say he needed a full-time auxiliary teacher or to be sent to a
special-needs school.
''We still need to analyse exactly what's best for him and once that
is done the appropriate action will be taken.''

DUMBARTON MP John McFall yesterday criticised the Scottish Sports
Council for its late objection on behalf of water-skiers to the by-law
plans for Loch Lomond, claiming they were ''playing Russian roulette
with people's lives in my area''.
He said: ''The council is either being used as a pawn or is using
others as pawns in an attempt to negate an extensive and exhaustive
public consultation exercise which ended on May 27.''
The Scottish Secretary is seeking advice from Scottish Office lawyers
and environment officials on how to deal with the cuts the Scottish
Sports Council wants to the proposed by-laws which, it had been hoped,
would have been in place this summer.
Mr McFall today chairs his third seminar on the future of Loch Lomond
at Duck Bay Marina.
He wants to see the welfare of Loch Lomond having a high place on the
agendas of the new unitary councils which will form the new joint
committee to run Loch Lomond and the Trossachs -- Dumbarton and
Clydebank Council, Stirling Council, and Argyll and Bute Council.
Mr McFall will also announce he has the backing of Dunbartonshire
Enterprise to head up a consultation process on ideas for a Millenium
Fund project.
He was scathing about the delay to the introduction of loch by-laws.
''There are no other material considerations or facts which have been
put forward by the water ski-ing interests or the Scottish Sports
Council. As far as I can see, it is simply a delaying tactic.
''I will use all my powers to stop that from happening.''

BRITAIN and Ireland yesterday attempted to put the stalled Ulster
peace process back on track.
Senior civil servants of both governments met in London to seek an
agreement to end the deadlock over IRA arms and clear the way for a
meeting between prime ministers John Major and John Bruton.
However, Mr Peter Robinson, East Belfast Democratic Unionist MP, said
any Unionist taking part in talks with the Irish Government within the
parameters of the British and Irish framework document would be a
''traitor''.
He also claimed that because of the IRA ceasefire, the RUC was now
under orders not to ''interfere'' with any known Provisionals.
Mr Robinson alleged: ''Each and every IRA demand has or will be met in
whole or part, and no matter what opposition surfaces to the sell-out,
the British Government intends to push it through.''
Mr Gerry Adams,Sinn Fein president, on his way to Washington,
confirmed he was not interested in any international arms commission
which London and Dublin want established.
''Sinn Fein doesn't have any room to manoeuvre,'' he insisted. ''We
have a willingness to be involved in all-party talks. We want to bring
nothing more than our mandate to those negotiations.''
An SDLP delegation, headed by Mr John Hume, also had talks in Belfast
yesterday with Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, and
''offered ideas'' on how progress might be made, the Northern Ireland
Office said.
Downing Street and Dublin are anxious for a break in the weapons
impasse which has effectively put the peace process on hold.
The civil servants talked in London for several hours in an effort to
reverse last week's setback when a Chequers summit between Mr Major and
Mr Bruton was postponed.
But there was no sign last night that the Government was ready to
shift from its weapons demands.

Move to help distillers in their bid to ease duty burden.
EXCLUSIVE
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has called in representatives of
the Scotch Whisky Association to offer his help in persuading the
Treasury to ease the tax burden on one of Scotland's leading industries.
He has pledged to take a leading role in persuading Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke to ease the tax burden on whisky, which distillers claim is
affecting sales at home and abroad.
The meeting, offered by Mr Forsyth, marks a departure from his
predecessors, who have supported distillers in principle, but seldom
taken the initiative. When he was promoted earlier this summer, Mr
Forsyth promised to consult widely.
In its pre-Budget submission to the Treasury, the SWA will ask Mr
Clarke to introduce a programme of stepped cuts in the excise duty paid
on whisky, probably in the form of year-on-year reductions of 3 to 5%.
The SWA plans to involve other Ministers in the lobbying effort by
arguing that the health of the whisky industry is crucial, not just to
Scotland, but to the UK.
It will seek meetings with Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and Trade
Secretary Ian Lang who, as former Scottish Secretaries, are expected to
be sympathetic. Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg will also be involved.
Mr Forsyth's involvement will, for the moment, be limited to
correspondence with the Treasury in which he will put the SWA's case and
support its demands for a regular reductions. Meeting with Treasury
Ministers could follow.
The Treasury, however, is expected to resist. The Government has
shifted the tax burden from direct to indirect taxation, a trend it is
unlikely to reverse.
Although it has shown a willingness to freeze excise duty on spirits
in successive recent Budgets, pressure to reduce the public sector
borrowing requirement while delivering a pre-election cut in income tax
makes reducing what is perceived as an essential source of revenue
impossible.
Mr Campbell Evans, a spokesman for the SWA, said: ''We hope to see the
start of a staged reduction of excise duties on spirits. We will want a
commitment to a step by step reduction of excise duty over a number of
years.''
The SWA is particularly concerned about the high price of a bottle of
whisky in the UK compared to prices on the continent. An #11 bottle here
costs #5.30 in Spain and #8.50 in France.
Tax makes up 67% of the British price, and the SWA claims whisky sales
at home have fallen as a result, thereby reducing the amount of tax
revenue.

A CLIMBER who survived 26 hours on a Perthshire mountain after falling
200ft told one of his rescuers: ''I never prayed so hard in all my life
to stay alive.''
Mr David Thornton, 29, of Washington, Tyne and Wear, is due to begin a
new job as a Christian youth leader in a fortnight.
Mr Thornton hurtled 50ft down a steep slope then plunged over a 150ft
cliff face, landing on rocks below, on 3372ft Ben Challum. He escaped
with deep head cuts, a broken ankle, and a cracked hip bone.
Last night he was detained in the Vale of Leven Hospital, Alexandria,
Dunbartonshire, where his condition was described as ''comfortable''.
The first rescuer to reach him, joiner Donald King, 22, said: ''When I
got to David he looked in a very bad way. His head had been bleeding
badly from massive wounds. At first he had used a T-shirt to stauch the
bleeding, then he got a field dressing from his rucksack and applied
that himself.''
Mr King, of Bonaly Terrace, Colinton, Edinburgh, who was climbing
alone, had met two sisters at the summit on Saturday.
After reaching the top in mist, it cleared suddenly. As he looked down
the mountain, he heard six faint blasts on a whistle, the international
climbing distress signal.
Mr King said: ''All three of us tried to locate the sound and finally
we spotted David's orange survival bag. We all climbed down to him. The
girls told me they were first-aiders and we decided we should check the
condition of the injured man.
''We also checked our location on the map and the girls then went off
for help, leaving their water bottle behind for David.''
Mr King remained with the injured climber until they were spotted by
the crew of a Royal Navy rescue helicopter.

FORMER Barings Bank trader Nick Leeson's bid to talk Britain into
seeking his extradition from a German prison appeared to have failed
last night.
The Serious Fraud Office is expected to announce in the next few days
that it will not fight Singapore for the right to put the 28-year-old on
trial.
Officers spent six days questioning Leeson in his Frankfurt jail about
the #860m collapse of Barings.
Leeson's wife Lisa and lawyer Stephen Pollard are due to hold a news
conference in London today to capitalise on the publicity generated by
his first media interview, shown on BBC1 last night.
Leeson has offered to plead guilty to seven charges, including five of
false accounting, in a British court, but the SFO has previously
indicated that it will only seek his extradition if Singapore's request
fails.
Government officials in Singapore were adamant yesterday that Leeson
should be tried there.
A Frankfurt court is expected to rule on Singapore's application
toward the end of this month or the beginning of October, but the final
decision rests with Bonn.

MORE than 500 tourism businesses are taking part in the Autumn Gold
promotion, which aims to increase autumn tourism in Scotland by up to 7%
in its first year. More tourist attractions will be open during the
autumn and the Scottish tourism industry is giving away millions of
pounds worth of extra value in the form of special one-off offers.
All the holiday-makers need to take advantage of the offers is an
Autumn Goldcard, which will guarantee them a special offer wherever they
see the Autumn Gold sign. Travel by bus, train and plane will be reduced
by up to 50%, hotels are offering complimentary meals and three nights
for the price of two, and castles, restaurants, distilleries and museums
are staying open longer and giving people special added value offers.
Participating companies include British Airways, British Midland,
Stagecoach, Scotrail and Intercity, Stakis, Thistle and Mount Charlotte
Hotels, Lovat Hotels, the National Trust for Scotland, Historic Scotland
and literally hundreds of others.
''New England in the fall has got nothing on the New Scotland,'' said
Tom, star of Shirley Valentine.
''The autumn flowers, trees and wildlife are simply breathtaking and
the towns and cities are packed with things to see and do but not so
packed with people. Personally, I would love to do a bit of golfing,
followed up by a distillery tour, a visit to a few castles and perhaps a
night out in Edinburgh. With an Autumn Goldcard I could do that for not
much more than the price of staying at home.''
''Autumn Gold represents a significant breakthrough for our
industry,'' said Ian Grant, chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board.
''For the first time, tourism businesses and organisations are tackling
the issue of extending the season in a tangible way. By presenting
attractive offers in a collective, promotional package Autumn Gold will
fulfil consumers' demand for value from their short breaks to Scotland.
''Anyone who has ever been knows how stunning Scotland is in the
autumn and anyone who brings their Autumn Goldcard here in October and
November will have a break they'll never forget.''
The Autumn Gold offers will be valid from Friday, September 29 to
Thursday November 30 inclusive. To receive a free Autumn Goldcard and
brochure listing a selection of the offers available you can either
phone the Autumn Goldline on 0345 511511 or write to Autumn Gold, c/o
Holiday Scotland, FREEPOST, Glasgow G3 7BR.
Anyone who has ever been knows how stunning Scotland is in the autumn
and anyone who brings their Autumn Goldcard here in October and
November will have a break they'll never forget.''

<HEADLINE>Sleeping pill 'jelly' found in packet of sweets</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976421152</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A GRANDMOTHER discovered a Temazepam tablet in a packet of sweeties
she bought for her grand-daughter's fifth birthday party.
Mrs Margaret Fraser, 55, found the sleeping tablet in a tube of
Smarties she was planning to use to decorate cakes for the children's
celebration.
Now police have pledged they will track down the cuplrit who put the
drug in the sweetie tube.
Temazepam pills, known as ''jellies'', are the subject of a crackdown
on illegal possession to be announced today in Paisley by Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth.
The gel-filled sleeping tablets are used by heroin abusers.
Politicians and police have called for a ban on the substance.
Last night Mrs Fraser said: ''I was shocked when I saw the pill come
out of the tube. I dread to think what the consequences could have been
if I hadn't found it first.''
Mrs Fraser, of Douglas, Dundee, said she bought the tube of Smarties
from a Poundstretcher store in the Lochee area of the city.
A spokeswoman for Nestle Rowntree, the manufacturers of Smarties,
said: ''This is a matter we are extremely concerned about. All products
leave our factory in good and safe condition.''
The spokeswoman said she ''couldn't really speculate'' about how the
sleeping pill got into the sweets and added that that was a matter for
the police and the authorities.
''We are assisting the police with their inquiries. Until those
inquiries are complete, there's really not much more we can say at this
stage.''
Last night, Detective Chief Inspector Scott Robertson, of Tayside
Police, said: ''I can confirm that a capsule of Temazepam was found in a
packet of sweets bought in Dundee on Friday, September 1.
''The capsule was not actually found until the packet was opened on
Friday the eight and the fact that we have received no other reports of
similar finds does suggest an isolated incident.''
Police are now working with the sweet manufacturers, the shop where
the sweets were bought, and the environmental health department.
Mr Robertson added: ''We're currently working to establish where and
when the drug was actually put into the packet.
''Obviously putting anything into children's sweets is a totally
irresponsible, thoughtless, and criminal act and it's very fortunate
that no-one has been affected by this stupidity.''
Last night a spokesman for Poundstretcher said: ''We are treating it
very seriously and have instigated a full investigation.''

THE camp looks like a war zone -- only the rumble of thunder in the
distance is not the sound of tanks or Nato jets dropping bombs, but
earth-movers as they drive the extension of the M77 ever onwards.
It was hereabouts that former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart
confronted the self-styled Eco warriors -- a fracas that ended in court
yesterday with Mr Stewart fined #200 for breach of the peace.
In contrast to the noisy scenes that greeted Mr Stewart as he left
Paisley Sheriff Court, the camp is strangely quiet.
At its height, the camp had about 24 frontline troops, whose ranks on
action days ran in the hundreds. Now there are only 12 left. At
lunchtime yesterday, there were only eight people sitting round the
fire. Four had gone to court but the others had remained, believing that
Mr Stewart would plead guilty by letter and not in person.
The mood is muted. They had won a court battle, but lost the war.
''We have saved 200 to 300 trees and got the road modified. As far as
the M77 goes, we have done all we can to stop it,'' said Colin MacLeod,
28, who still lives in the trenches with his wife, Gehan, 25, and raw
recruit Tawny, who is only 10 weeks old.
They would not be celebrating Mr Stewart's comeuppance, said Mr
MacLeod. ''We have had people doing three months for just being involved
in peaceful protests. Mr Stewart's fine does not balance the situation.
''All we have is one MP making a fool of himself while we are still
suffering this crazy road. But it better than him getting away with
it.''
It is the refrain taken up by Heather McMahon, 31. With her Mohican
hairstyle and a skull tattooed on her shaven head, she looks fearsome,
but the looks are belied by a soft voice.
She had been set to give evidence against the MP with Mrs MacLeod, but
had been told by police that he was pleading guilty and that she would
not be needed in court.
''A fine of #200 is nothing to him, but at least he got fined. If it
had been the other way about, we would have been sent to jail. It always
comes down to the difference in class.''
Mrs MacLeod said: ''We thought it might be too embarrassing for the
establishment to prosecute him. At least we know now that there are not
two laws in existence, one for them, and one for us.''

ONE way to relax before the long haul into the depths of winter is to
take a romantic short break. A couple of days away, just the two of you,
with nothing to worry about except each other.
Lovebirds looking for a romantic atmosphere will find all they need in
a country hotel, where the invariably stunning settings give a real
feeling of getting far away, but in reality they can be just an hour's
drive from the city.
Autumn evenings in country hotels are perfect for candlelit dinners,
where the only worries are what to wear, and which wines will best
accompany your choice of food.
Some hotels can offer added privacy, allowing you to dine in your room
-- and when it is decked out with a four-poster bed swathed in linen and
lace and there's a fire roaring in the grate, who needs other company?
This level of luxury won't always come cheaply but for special
occasions, memories last after the money is spent.
Hotel staff are more than willing to help out with any extras or
special requirements which add a personal touch to your break. Something
as simple as your favourite flowers in your room can set the romantic
tone. Ask for details when you book.
It may be that you're more romantically inclined towards the sea and
Scotland's rugged coastline, which never loses its beauty, whatever the
season.
Days need nothing more than long walks skimming stones along the
shore, and a fresh seafood lunch or dinner. The beautiful seafront
hotels in coastal towns can be even more welcoming when summer and the
ice-cream vendors have gone.
Autumn can also be the perfect time of year to enjoy wildlife. It's
simple to go further afield, with regular ferries to the islands, where
the choice of accommodation will come as a pleasant surprise.
A romantic break doesn't need to be filled with activity, simply
having time to talk about things that are forgotten in the swirl of
daily routine is reward enough.
For a weekend of unrivalled luxury, choose a hotel which offers a
leisure centre with swimming, sauna, massage and a jacuzzi. Or load up
the car with champagne, strawberries and the most delicious foods you
can think of and head for a secluded log cabin or lodge, situated in one
of Scotland's most beautiful areas.
Romance doesn't have to be hearts and flowers. Treat your partner to a
Murder Mystery Weekend, a medieval banquet or a weekend away to see a
top show in Glasgow or Edinburgh. Even the big cities can offer quiet
times together, with beautiful parkland and quiet tearooms to keep out
the autumn chill.
The choice of escape can be as varied as each couple. A long weekend
of good food, wine and luxurious long lies or a cultural extravaganza
where being without domestic hassles is bliss in itself -- Scotland can
offer it all.

Rennie McOwan offers would-be walkers some hints on how to tackle
Scotland's most controversial long-distance footpath
YOU make the acquaintance of all kinds of people in the outdoors . . .
James Bond (well, nearly), cattle raiders, the Redcoats who built
military roads in a wilderness and the clanspeople who attacked them,
goblins and navvies, faeries and poets, shepherds and writers.
All you have to do is plan, read, get equipped for walking and set
out.
Walking ''official'' long distance footpaths is not everyone's cup of
tea because they can cause environmental controversy, but for other
people they can also open the door to all kinds of other, personal
expeditions as well as being a challenge in themselves. No verdict is
possible without experience.
The West Highland Way, which runs for 95 miles (152 km) from Milngavie
on the outskirts of Glasgow, to the old military base of Fort William,
now a busy town in Lochaber and formerly called Maryburgh, takes the
explorer through constantly changing scenery.
Rich farmland is followed by moors, glens, the shores of Loch Lomond,
18th century military and cattle drove routes and the fringe of great
hills.
It is busy and popular, and its creation is a lively subject for an
argument. One verdict is that corridor-routes are contrary to
traditional (and responsible) freedom to roam, large numbers of people
inevitably erode the track, and that wilderness quality is diluted by
way-marker signs, management controls and tourism facilities.
Another verdict is that the Way provides an acceptable route through
some sensitive ground, that its safety-level encourages newcomers to go
to the outdoors in confidence, that visitors like its clear-cut
character, that it can be an introduction to wider wandering and it
brings immense tourism benefits.
The jury is still out on this one, and the walker can do sections of
the route, if that is desired. The best parts are the views of Loch
Lomond-side (walkers are asked to avoid Conic Hill during springtime
lambing), the former military road from close to the old drovers inn at
Inveroran, on the fringe of the Black Mount, with glorious views across
wild Rannoch Moor and to the big mountains of Glen Coe, the Wall of
Rannoch and Mamores, and the so-called Devil's Staircase from the
eastern end of Glen Coe over the hills to the ''aluminium village'' of
Kinlochleven.
Some of the soldiers detailed to block the exit from Glen Coe during
the notorious massacre of 1692 marched over the Devil's Staircase. They
arrived too late to stop many of the escaping MacDonalds, perhaps
deliberately because their orders to massacre their unsuspecting hosts
filled some of them with revulsion.
It is wise to take time to plan walking the Way, to allow extra days
or hours to climb wayside hills such as Ben Dorain, near Bridge of
Orchy, so beloved of the Gaelic poet, Duncan Ban MacIntyre,
Fair-Duncan-of-the-Songs, or to visit historical sites, such as St
Fillan's Priory, near Tyndrum, where the fugitive King Robert the Bruce
was once given shelter and where sacred relics of St Fillan were once
cared for by guardians called Dewar.
It is worthwhile deviating from the route to walk from Kinlochleven up
to the Blackwater Dam and to see the graves of the navvies and to
understand how the burns, rivers and lochs of the Highlands were
harnessed to use water power in the production of aluminium.
Take time to browse, think and look around. Red deer, wild goats and
occasional eagles can all be seen.
The Way sticks mainly to lower ground -- the highest point is 1450ft
(450 metres) -- but the weather in Scotland can be cold and wet. Ensure
you are adequately clad.
Carrying a gigantic pack for long distances is no fun. Some people
start on the Way with colossal burdens and have to give up. Some do not
break themselves in before they start on the walk. Others begin with new
boots, whose stiffness or poor-fit cause blisters. Take anti-midge
lotion. The best plan is to work out how much you feel you can do in a
day.
Seven to nine miles is a sensible distance for newcomers. Book
accommodation ahead and have changes of clothes sent on by parcel in
advance (and send the old stuff back).Read up about the route, and it
will greatly add to your enjoyment.
James Bond? A memorial stands close to the highest point of the Way
which commemorates diplomat, traveller, soldier, and secret agent Peter
Fleming, who died from a heart attack on August 18, 1971.
He was the brother of Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond
novels, and some of his adventures helped Ian shape the character of the
best-known fiction secret agent of all time.
Walk the Way with sense. It is a glorious walk for the autumn because
the air is cool, the scourge of the midge has lessened or gone, the deer
can be heard roaring on the hills and moors, and the stags strive to
protect their harem of hinds. The changing colours are memorable.
You should not be shaken. Hopefully you will be stirred.

THE area is bounded by two major rivers which have defined the land
which lies between them. It has largely survived some of the worst
ravages inflicted by the industrial age, and has become different from
the rest of Scotland.
Today Fife, bounded by the Forth and Tay, is a major player in the
tourism industry, vying with more recognised resorts seeking to cash in
on the #2bn spent in Scotland each year. It has more than recovered its
beauty and its attraction as a land of resort.
For centuries it was a difficult place for travellers to reach,
involving a tedious land journey or a hazardous sea crossing over the
unpredictable waters of the Forth.
Today, it is a wonderful place for tourists to discover.
It has, within its boundaries, glorious long and clean beaches, lovely
hills, and coastal walks to catch and hold the interest of the casual
stroller or the serious rambler.
It has golf courses renowned around the world, and others tucked away
in seemingly incongruous places to tempt the beginner, the
low-handicappers or the holidaymaker.
Inland there are small towns with restaurants supplying the finest
cuisine. At the Peat Inn, in the tiny village of the same name, parties
of diners have been known to fly into Scotland by private plane and
reach the restaurant by hired limousine to enjoy the gourmet food.
In contrast, in small fishing towns like Pittenweem and Anstruther,
there are quayside fish and chip shops with summertime queues of
customers who wait an hour for quality meals to feed a family at
reasonable prices.
Just outside St Andrews is the Craigtoun Park, where one entry payment
opens the entire park to families, allowing them to choose as many
activities as they like. On offer are swings, rides, gardens, boating,
walks, putting and bowling greens.
From Kincardine and Dunfermline in the South of the region to Cupar
and St Andrews in the North, there is a feast of activity and relaxation
for the tourist.
The East Coast of Fife has been a tourist attraction for the majority
of the Scottish population since the explosion of the railways in the
late 1880s.
That magnificent feat of Victorian engineering, the Forth Bridge,
thrust its shining rails across what was then a county to the banks of
the River Tay, where another bridge led into Dundee and the counties
north of Angus and Aberdeenshire.
In those days the county, built on aeons-old seams of coal, prospered
mightily. That particularly useful product had been discovered by
medieval monks, and in Victorian days was to transform the West of the
county into an industrial wasteland of sour and unkempt pit bings and
factories.
But satellite industries like engineering, linen, and paper mills grew
and spilled their prosperity on to the favoured coastal towns.
As generations of miners toiled to extract the coal to feed industries
in the South, Glasgow business-men took summer houses in little resorts
like Aberdour, Largo, Elie, Crail and St Andrews to send their families
away from the city to the more salubrious airs of the coast.
And tourism grew. In the l930s and 40s, particulary after the Second
World War, beaches were packed with working families from Glasgow and
Edinburgh enjoying the Fair holidays in Fife.
Then it all died back with the advent of the cheap package holiday in
the Mediterranean resorts of Spain, Italy and Greece.
Today the pits, the bings, the dirt and the neglected land have gone
to be replaced by country parks and clean lochs.
The favoured resorts like St Andrews, secure, almost self-satisfied,
with its place in the world of international golf, are now recognising
that they cannot rest on past reputations.
Work is now being done to bring attention to the many attractions
apart from the traditional holiday pursuits available in the region.
Dunfermline, seat of the Scottish court for more than 500 years, is
promoting its history alongside a year-long diary of events like jazz
and arts festivals.
Former pit bings have been levelled and leisure parks incorporating
golf courses and trout lochs have been built.
New sports like clay pigeon shooting, water skiing and wind surfing
have been developed and are thriving.
Hoteliers and professional tourism managers are seeking ways to extend
the season to accomodate the more leisured population.
Fife, once a kingdom described as a ''beggar's mantle fringed with
gold'', is all of that once more, and more.

Andrew Douglas finds Scotland's golf courses do not close for the
winter
SCOTLAND'S golf courses, and there's almost 450 of them, don't close
down for the autumn and winter months. And with modern equipment such as
the fairway and greens verti-drain machines lending a hand, greenkeepers
are able to keep their courses in good condition.
It is only those exceptionally low-lying courses that become heavy to
play through the winter but most progressive clubs have installed
drainage systems to reduce the problem in troubled areas.
Consequently, many golfers who at one time cast their clubs into the
darkness of the attic until the first signs of spring, are now enjoying
their sport all year round. Undoubtedly those courses by the coast enjoy
an upsurge in interest through the winter. Links courses drain and wear
well because of their sandy subsoil, and the often higher temperature
and drier conditions near the sea help encourage growth to keep up with
the summer's deterioration.
Courses whose reputations are at stake will have invested heavily in
their most important asset, and the ''course closed'' sign will have
long been despatched to the skip with the narrow-wheeled caddy-car. But
many clubs ban caddy cars throughout the winter months because they
believe damage may be caused.
But where to go for that golfing break?
In Scotland no-one is far from the coast, and if one is to match the
pleasures and conditions enjoyed in the summer game it will be the links
course that must first be considered.
Accommodation is plentiful in all of Scotland's seaside towns, and
golf packages are often a feature of the hotel and guest house trade.
Packages are regularly customised to suit the client and are not totally
built around midweek golf. Reduced green fees and preferential tee-off
times are also a feature of many packages; an important consideration if
you wish to cram as many holes as possible into autumn's reduced
daylight hours.
Looking south to the Solway coast, ideal at any time for a family
break, Southerness catches the eye. Host this year to the Scottish
Amateur Championship, it is recognised as being of championship stature
and is becoming increasingly popular with the visitor.
Along this coast also is Powfoot, near Annan, boasting its own hotel
overlooking the links. The course was designed by James Braid and twists
and turns between huge sand dunes. Try also Dunskey, a natural
phenomenon and Braid's last, Stranraer.
Into Ayrshire, and a blaze of courses meets the eye with a variety of
green fees to accompany. Brunston Castle at Dailly was built by Bob
Lowe, a Belgian diamond merchant who after spending many a holiday at
nearby Turnberry fell in love with the area, bought the land and built a
course. Opened three years ago, it has settled well and is a good course
offering excellent value for money.
Because many of Ayrshire's courses are owned by the council, green
fees are low. The good and the famous are a bit more expensive to play
but their condition is generally exceptional and worth the cost.
Belleisle, by Burns Cottage; Barassie, St Cuthbert, St Nicholas and
Prestwick Old where the first of our Open championships was played;
Western Gailes, and West Kilbride which goes out and in on a narrow
strip of land making it a hooker's dream are all in this category.
Throughout Scotland the pattern continues. Courses designed by
well-known golf course architects and courses that just evolved, in fact
were always there, waiting for man to come along with his hickories and
featherie ball to make a game of it.
In the Highlands, courses at Nairn, Royal Dornoch and the scenic Brora
are all geared for the golfing break with accommodation on the doorstep;
yards of golfers drive through the roads of Fife to Aberdour, Lundin,
Levin, Balbirnie, Crail and of course St Andrews with its selection of
Old, New, Jubilee and Eden and where a discount might even be negotiated
at this time of year.
In the Borders a brochure Freedom of the Fairways can be obtained from
the local tourist board which gives information on green fees and
conditions of play. The area has many fine mansion houses that have been
converted into hotels and for that special break the Dryburgh Abbey
Hotel within a pitching wedge of the abbey itself may fill that role.
Golfing in Scotland is certainly an all-year-round sport with
interesting, challenging and friendly courses everywhere which when
coupled with a huge variety of hotels make that golfing break away a
memorable occasion.

WHERE in Scotland can visitors sit under a palm tree, explore miles of
deserted sandy beaches, play golf on ''the best first hole in the
world'', enjoy uncrowded roads and the charms of ''the most remote town
in mainland Britain'' and yet be within easy travelling distance of
Glasgow?
It is the birthplace of, and inspiration for, William McTaggart, one
of Scotland's greatest landscape painters. Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney sang
about it and still has a house there. So no prizes for correctly
identifying the beautiful Kintyre Peninsula, that favourite haunt of
Para Handy who finally ''sealed the knot'' in Campbeltown.
For the active, there are five golf courses -- including that ''best
first hole'' at Machrihanish, fishing, walking, wind surfing, sailing,
diving, pony trekking and clay pigeon shooting.
For those seeking a more relaxing break there are those miles of sand,
gentle forest walks, traditional shops, the oldest (but completely
modernised) operating cinema in Scotland, three heritage centres and a
museum, castles and beautiful old houses to visit.
Or take the craft trail and visit Kintyre's wide range of craft
enterprises. Local artists, goldsmiths, knitwear and clothing,
Scotland's only organic tannery, silk printing, basketry, wood turning
and a host of others make present-buying a pleasure.
Kintyre is rich in history and archaeology with an abundance of
cairns, standing stones and duns. St Columba left his footprints at
Southend, the Vikings ruled, Robert the Bruce wandered Kintyre as a
fugitive and Dunaverty Rock was the scene of a massacre far worse than
Glencoe.
For many, an added attraction of Kintyre is the climate: the lowest
rainfall in the west of Scotland, the influence of the Gulf Stream and
snow-free winters. Wildlife enthusiasts will appreciate the unspoiled
environment and the abundance of birds (over 200 species) including
golden eagles, otters, seals, wild goats and deer.
Almost an island -- Kintyre has the added advantage of the direct road
connection. A two-hour drive leads to Tarbert then it's a further 50
minutes to Campbeltown.
Returning to the island theme, it is possible to go to Kintyre by
ferry. The ferry link from Ardrossan to Arran and then to Kintyre is
very popular and the new ferry crossing from Portavadie to Tarbert is
fast catching up.
(Take the ferry from Gourock to Dunoon, drive across the Cowal
peninsula to Portavadie and then take the new ferry from there to
Tarbert.)

DUNFERMLINE and its surrounding district hide a medieval past, a
history reaching back centuries into the days of a Royal Scotland, a
country ruled by warrior kings, saintly queens and powerful abbots.
It also boasts one of the warmest welcomes for visitors of any town in
the county of Fife.
The centre of the town is a modern bustle of shops, malls, arcades and
multi-national brand name shops -- a city centre in miniature.
It sits easily beside winding streets of Victorian tenements and
elegant town houses which in turn complement the ancient stones of
Dunfermline Abbey.
The abbey itself is virtually a Scottish Westminster Abbey, burial
place of monarchs and saints. More than 20 kings, queens, princes and
powerful churchmen who ruled alongside the royal families are interred
here.
The most famous to lie under the stones of the abbey is the great
Scottish hero and king, Robert the Bruce, buried here under the square
turrets and soaring spires of the much-restored and rebuilt landmark.
Alongside the abbey is the recently restored Abbot House, which dates
back to 1460 and is now a heritage centre, a building of massive
proportions and many rooms, one of Scotland's oldest domestic buildings.
Every room has a story to tell, recalled through entertaining
audio-visual guides. But the area offers more than ancient history.
This year a local initiative allowed visitors into buildings not
normally visited by the public. The police station opened its doors,
with guided tours which included visits to the cells.
One of the most unusual attractions for collectors of the bizarre was
a visit to an unusual lavatory in the Music Institute. It is a relic of
Victorian days with blue glazed bowl and dark wood, and is certainly a
masterpiece of turn-of-the century plumbing.
Other buildings which may be open again for a special occasion could
include the fire station, the old and dignified City Chambers, and worth
a visit at any time is the Andrew Carnegie birthplace and museum.
Carnegie emigrated from Dunfermline with his family in 1848, and by
1901 was the world's richest man, with a fortune of $400 million forged
in his Pittsburg steel mills.
He deemed it would be a sin to die rich, and much of his money came to
improve the lives and lot of the local people of his home town. Among
his many bequests were the beautiful Pittencrieff Park and the Carnegie
Hall, a magnificent concert venue.
Included in the many popular and new ideas introduced this year by the
district tourist authorities have been historical tours of the villages
of Charlestown and Limekilns, early examples of planned industrial
development.
This year the oil complexes at Mossmoran and Braefoot Bay will also
welcome visitors.
One of the biggest tourist venues in Central Scotland, the spectacular
Deep Sea World at North Queensferry, is growing in popularity. The
walk-through aquarium is a world-class attraction.
Away from the tourist trail a mega-concert opportunity is scheduled
for later in the month. Local girl become international star Barbara
Dickson will be appearing at the Carnegie Hall on the 23rd of this
month.
Not far away is the Knockhill racing circuit, and there is a trout
fishery in the Lochore Meadows leisure park. There are country walks,
and the Scottish Water Ski centre at Townhill Loch just to the north.
Dunfermline is just a short drive across the Forth Road Bridge for
people from Edinburgh, and just a little longer from Glasgow. This short
trip opens up the whole of West Fife to tourists for holidays or day
trips.
For more information about the area and where to stay, contact the
Tourist Information Centre: 01383 624330.

Visitors will find Agapanthus and Watsonias in bloom in autumn at
Inverewe Garden, near Gairloch in the West Highlands. These flowers are
native to South Africa.
October and November are popular months for climbing and hillwalking.
Scotland has 279 munros (peaks over 3000ft, latest assessment) and 217
corbets (peaks between 2500-3000ft).
Scotland's oldest inhabited house is Traquair House, Innerleithen,
built in the tenth century.
During October and November, 20% of the total population of Icelandic
Geese visit the Montrose Basin, where the Scottish Wildlife Trust has
recently opened a new visitor centre.
Average rainfall in Edinburgh in the months of October and November is
consistently lower than that in July and August.
Lerwick, Shetland will have seven minutes more daylight than London on
October 1.
The new Skye Bridge, connecting the island to the mainland at Kyle of
Lochalsh, is due to open in early October.
Edinburgh's pubs are not just open late during the Festival. Autumn
visitors can enjoy a drink in the city's bars until two in the morning
-- clubs are open even later.
Autumn is a great time for deer watching. Scotland has a population of
more than 500,000 deer.
The tallest trees in the British Isles can be found in Scotland.
Douglas Firs at The Hermitage in Perth and Dunans in Argyll share the
record at 212ft each.

Rennie McOwan finds some gems of Scotland's heritage
YOU don't always need warm sunshine to see things in a memorable
light. Sir Walter Scott wrote about that in his epic poem, The Lay of
the Last Minstrel, and told of visiting Melrose Abbey at night.
It wasn't one of his better couplets and runs:
''If thou wouldst view fair Melrose aright,
Go visit it by the pale moonlight.''
It sparked off a row because old John Bower, the custodian of the
Abbey in Scott's time, maintained that he never let Scott have the key
for a night visit.
Scott retorted in more verse and the upshot was that Scott enthusiasts
began to make a moonlight pilgrimage to the ruin.
Melrose Abbey, one of the gems of the Scottish Borders, is now in the
care of Historic Scotland and it can indeed look truly evocative at
night, but like a lot of other semi-ruinous buildings it can more easily
take on an atmosphere of the past at the quieter times, at the tail end
of the year when visitor numbers are inevitably fewer.
Historic Scotland opens the Abbey ''out of season'', from October
through to March, on a timetable of 9.30am to 4.30pm from Monday to
Saturday. On Sunday the times are 2pm to 4.30pm.
Don't let the colder days of autumn and winter put you off. The old
stones can still sparkle with life and there is much to see. The
stonework of the Cistercian monks includes a musical angel, a monk
telling his beads, a fat mason with a chisel and mallet and a cook with
his ladle. There are carvings of kitchen plants and flowers and --
honest -- of a pig playing the bagpipes.
The remaining large windows are gloriously attractive and there are
side chapels to the Borders families, including the Scotts, lairds of
Gala, and the Pringles.
King Robert the Bruce's heart was reputedly buried here after the
famous fights the Scots had with the Moors when taking Bruce's heart to
the Holy Land. Douglas and other leaders died when they charged into the
enemy's ranks. Bruce's heart was brought back. His body was buried at
Dunfermline.
There are other famous graves here, including that of Michael Scott, a
reputed wizard. And at the back of it all lie the three peaks of the
Eildon Hills, so beloved of Scott, and which overlook the historic town
and all in an area where the invading Romans left their mark. If you are
going up the Eildons, then watch out for early-dark times.
Melrose is a gem, but it also demonstrates a winter tourism
difficulty. Many great houses, castles and battle sites are still open
to visitors throughout the winter, but others are not. Opening and
closing times vary greatly.
Two organisations in Scotland owning most historic sites are, of
course, Historic Scotland, a Government agency, and the National Trust
for Scotland, which is a charity. Both of these have properties open in
autumn and winter and this particularly true of Historic Scotland who
own so many castles, standing stones and other semi-ruinous buildings.
But the visitor has to be wary of misjudging opening times. I can
recall swearing inwardly when visiting Sweetheart Abbey, south of
Dumfries, founded in 1273 by Devorgilla in memory of her husband, John
Balliol (she also founded Balliol College, Oxford) when I found it shut
at a time when I thought it would be open.
The all important rule is to get hold of the excellent publications
produced by Historic Scotland, at Longmore House, Salisbury Place,
Edinburgh, or the National Trust for Scotland, 5 Charlotte Square,
Edinburgh, or the Scottish Tourist Board, 23 Ravelston Place, Edinburgh,
and then to check these carefully.
Because the weather is colder and the trees have lost their leaves is
no reason for not going a-journeying and a-visiting. There is plenty of
variety.
Some out of season attractions include the Robert Burns trail, the
all-year visitor centre at the former weaving village of New Lanark,
famed for its enlightened working conditions, the Borders Festival in
the second-half of October, moated Caerlaverock Castle, near Dumfries,
and the nearby bird reserve when the geese are flying in.
Edinburgh and Glasgow have their famous galleries and museums (the
castle lends itself to browsing once the summer hordes have dwindled).
Dundee has its Discovery Point where the Antarctic journeys of Captain
Scott are a focal point and Stirling has its famous castle. Not far away
is the Rob Roy Centre, in the town of Callander. You've seen the film,
now examine the reality. The truth is greater than the legend.
Grampian and Fife have attractive driving and walking and the seashore
in autumn and winter can be very stimulating.
The end of October is a fairly common time for some castles and great
houses -- alas -- to close, but with every year that passes the season
for visitors seems to enlarge.
But if the worst comes to the worst, you can be like Sir Walter and
look at the ruins by moonlight from the outside.

A message from Derek Reid, chief executive of the Scottish Tourist
Board
IT isn't every year that the people arriving back from their charter
holidays on the Mediterranean have lighter suntans than those who stayed
at home. This summer's glorious weather has reminded many of us that, in
good weather, there is no finer country on earth than Scotland.
Two consumer holiday guides published this year confirmed the point.
The Which Guide to Scotland said: ''The best reason for choosing to go
on holiday in Scotland this year is this: it is one of the last places
inside the crowded and frenetic European Union where it is possible,
indeed easy, to be left alone in empty countryside. This is not to say
that Scotland, like everywhere else, does not have its tourist traps,
its crowded roads or its popular beauty spots. It is merely to stress
that it is easy to escape from them. Nor is it to imply that Scotland is
a deserted wilderness -- it has great cities, its country hotels and its
festivals.''
The Lonely Planet Guide said: You could hardly call it a secret, but
for a country that has some of the world's most dramatic and unspoilt
scenery, it is curiously under-rated and unknown. Surprisingly, few of
English realise what an extraordinary neighbour they have.''
As for the Scots, we've always been proud of our heritage, our
landscape and our culture. We've not always translated that interest
into a holiday or a short break; but there is evidence that this year
more Scots have ''re-discovered'' their country.
Many of those people may not have taken a holiday in Scotland for some
time, if at all. They will apply the same standards to their domestic
experience as they would overseas. I believe that they will have found
greater improvements in the standards of Scottish hospitality, cuisine,
service and accommodation. What's more, they will have found an industry
marketing itself in a way that would not have been possible a few years
ago.
The Scottish Office has made available to the Scottish Tourist Board
more resources to promote this country to the English and Scots. The
industry has responded by backing a number of campaigns encouraging
short holidays, not just in the height of the summer heatwave, but at
all times of the year.
Our Autumn Gold campaign is an outstanding offer to those considering
a weekend or short holiday in October or November when many would claim
that Scotland is at its loveliest and rivals New England's attractions.
The campaign is backed by more than 500 special offers, discounts and
activities, so that you and your family can enjoy a break whatever the
weather may be doing. Visitor attractions are opening for longer and you
can try your hand at anything from pottery-making to claret-tasting or
cookery classes -- or you can simply relax. Travel by bus, train and
plane will be reduced by up to 50%. Bookings can be made with an Autumn
Gold card and brochure and details can be obtained by calling the Autumn
Goldline on 0345 511511.

Chillier weather needn't cool walkers' enthusiasm, says Rennie McOwan
There can be a crispness in the autumn air invigorating scents of
fallen leaves, and the countryside gradually being shed of its summer
finery and reduced to stark and bare essentials.
But before that cycle is completed there is a period of glorious
colour, of red, yellow, saffron and brown as the leaves flourish for the
last time and then die.
It is a good time to walk, and even after the first snows brush the
mountain summits at the end of October -- known in past times as the
early shepherd which forced flocks and herds on to the lower ground --
there are ample opportunities for highly enjoyable walking.
Scotland in autumn and early winter can be exhilarating, although some
good humour is needed as well on days in which cold rain seems to
saturate the landscape.
Caution is needed when rambling and hillwalking in autumn and
throughout the winter and spring. When the snows are heavy on the hills
then the higher ground should be left to the expert mountaineer,
properly clad and competent in the use of ice axe and crampons.
Temperatures on Ben Nevis in winter are the same as in Arctic Norway,
and more people have been killed on The Ben, as Fort William people call
it, than on the north face of the Eiger.
But there are still plenty of opportunities for enjoyable and safe
walks, in glens, through passes, on islands, along coasts or loch
shores, on lower hills. Plan sensibly and remember that darkness falls
early. A hill or pass easily tramped in the height of summer can be a
different proposition if plastered in deep, soft snow or in a howling
wind.
First of all, ensure your gear is adequate. Well-fitting, stout boots,
thick socks selected for personal comfort, gaiters and overtrousers. You
need an anorak with a hood, a balaclava helmet, mitts, scarf, suitable
underwear and jerseys.
Some people specifically buy thermal underwear, but for gentle strolls
and rambles on the lower ground the kind of gear people put on to go
sledging with the kids will generally suffice.
Plan your route carefully. Ensure it is within your fitness and
timetable capabilities and that you can complete it before dark. Three
miles an hour is an average walking pace, but add time for halts or
going uphill.
In your rucksack you should have a torch, spare jerseys, a plastic
survival bag (which acts as a wind break in time of trouble), food and
drink for the day and extra food, plus map and compass. Tell friends
where you are going.
Show sensitivity towards the needs of farms and estates, take all
rubbish home, leave gates as you find them (closing a gate a farmer
wants open can cause problems), be sensible about house privacy, don't
disturb stock and if you are going on to the hills, check locally to see
if deer stalking is going on.
Most tourism areas have maps or booklets about short walks of three or
four miles, or longer ones ranging from seven to 12 miles. It is often
very difficult in Scotland to find circular walks; the hill terrain
tends not to lend itself readily to that, but Forest Enterprise, the
Government's forestry agency, often way-marks circular walks in
woodland.
But be positive. Plan and act. The rewards can be great: the freshness
in the air and an end of the sultry atmosphere and the swarming insects
of summer, the constantly changing colours, the sense of eternal things,
of seeing the first of the winter migrant birds and the departure of the
summer birds, and of outdoor life as a whole starting to batten itself
down for the winter.
If you are in Fife, it is worth making a trip to the Scottish Deer
Centre, near Cupar. It is packed with interesting displays and
''farmed'' deer and a useful advance lesson about the life of our
biggest land mammal. The centre is open from March 25 to late October,
seven days a week, 10am to 5pm (Tel 01337 810 3917).
Plan your route carefully. Ensure it is within your fitness and
timetable capabilities and that you can complete it before dark

LABOUR leader Tony Blair will walk into a fierce inter-union row over
the implementation of a statutory national minimum wage when he attends
the Trades Union Congress at Brighton today.
A clash is certain after the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical
Union suggested yesterday that the wage should be set as low as #3 an
hour.
The union, which at the weekend reopened the controversy over skill
differentials, followed up by floating the idea of a minimum phased in
over five years.
Acting general secretary Ken Jackson said his union had been
overwhelmed by the response to his call for a Labour government to take
differentials into account when fixing the level at which to set a
national minimum wage.
''We seem to have struck a chord,'' said Mr Jackson, especially with
regard to phasing in.
''Why not start with a low minimum of say #3 an hour and gradually
build up to the agreed final formula figure?'' he suggested.
Many unions, which have agreed to go along with the TUC strategy of
not stating a target figure at this stage, have policies supporting
#4.15 an hour.
The largest union, Unison, hit back immediately, with general
secretary Alan Jinkinson complaining that #3 was ''far too low'', lower
even than Labour's social justice commission's illustrative figure of
#3.50 and the TUC's negotiating target of #4.
While agreeing that differentials needed to be addressed, adopting #3
an hour as a starting figure would be a betrayal of millions of workers
who were looking to the unions to lift them out of poverty, he said.
Ucatt general secretary George Brumwell, who reluctantly withdrew an
amendment calling for #4.15, accused the AEEU of adopting a selfish
attitude which did nothing to help those who are barely able to scratch
a living.
He said the AEEU had broken ranks by calling for wage differentials to
be taken into account, a move which undermined the credible arguments
for a national minimum wage.
Transport and General Workers Union' general secretary Bill Morris
attacked the AEEU for ''making policy on the hoof'' and being out of
step with the TUC's agreed strategy.
Many unions already fear that Labour's reluctance to name a figure
until after an election victory and discussions with employers will
result in a figure well short of #4.15.
This move by the staunchly loyal Blair-supporting AEEU will serve to
increase those fears which are expected to be voiced on the floor of
congress tomorrow.
Mr Blair will also be uneasy about talks of increased militancy after
two unions began balloting for industrial action in separate disputes
over pay and hours.
The Civil and Public Services Association is balloting its 20,000
members at the Employment Service for strikes in protest at an imposed
2.75% pay rise and 25,000 BT engineers are voting for action in protest
at shift changes.
Another dispute flared up last night when talks aimed at settling a
pay dispute at London Underground broke down with the threat of a
48-hour walkout next week.
TUC general secretary John Monks, who warned at the weekend of
increased militancy, was last night sticking by his message that unions
wouldtake on bad employers.
The AEEU also reiterated its intention to take militant action against
''bad'' employers who refused to reduce working hours.

<HEADLINE>Howells reopens devolution 'wobble'</HEADLINE>

A FRESH row over the depth of
Labour's commitment to devolution started yesterday when the party's
constitutional spokesman at the Home Office said change was more of an
issue for the ''chattering classes'' than on the doorsteps.
Welsh MP Kim Howells, a veteran campaigner against Plaid Cymru,
compared nationalism to fascism, but although he appeared to play down
the whole issue of constitutional change, he did reaffirm Labour's
promise to create a Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly.
Coming so soon after party leader Tony Blair finally laid to rest any
suggestion of alleged ''wobbles'' on constitutional change, Mr Howells's
comments seemed to resurrect a question mark.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson was dismissive, however:
''Tony Blair was asked these questions explicitly last week and passed
every test without ambiguity. So, what a junior spokesman in an English
and Welsh department has to offer to add to that I cannnot say. Not a
lot, I would suspect.''
But SNP leader Alex Salmond claimed Mr Howells's comments showed that,
to Labour, Westminster was more important than the needs of Scots
voters. He said: ''For Labour devolution is, and always was, simply a
device to get them through a General Election with their Scottish vote
intact.
''They have been promising to deliver for 100 years, and their
dishonesty about their intentions remains as obvious and transparent as
ever.''
When Mr Howells was given his constitutional portfolio, Welsh
Nationalists compared this to ''putting a rapist in charge of the
nunnery'', but Labour sources insisted that his former antipathy to
devolution now made him a master of the brief, in the manner of a
poacher turned gamekeeper.
He certainly seemed less than enthusiastic about the importance of the
issue yesterday. ''My Home Office role includes dangerous dogs as well
as constitutional affairs,'' he joked.
''It's not an issue, frankly. In seven years of campaigning, I have
been asked about it two or three times on the doorstep, whereas I have
faced two or three hundred questions on education and unemployment. It
is largely a property of the chattering classes rather than the ordinary
voters.''
On the specifics of a Scottish parliament, Mr Howells said that was
for Mr Robertson and a Labour cabinet to decide. ''I'm not as familiar
with the Scottish situation as with that in Wales. I am not lukewarm. I
like to think I am a realist. If anyone can find a way through, George
Robertson will.''

DON'T snarl at your computer . . . one day its grandson might come
along and exact revenge.
According to Professor Kevin Warwick, computers are getting so smart
they could eventually become our masters.
In fact, computers and robots of the future would probably treat us
the way many of us now treat animals.
''In the next few decades we will have machines and computers with far
superior brain power and computational capacity than humans,'' said
Professor Warwick, who is professor of cybernetics at Reading
University.
The potential for a level of intelligence far above humans is clear,
he said.
''Even the most conservative estimates indicate that in the early part
of the next century accessible computational power with known artificial
means, such as electronic circuitry, will be greater than that of
humans,'' he said.
''Clearly, it will be possible in the next 50 years to achieve
artificial intelligence systems which are not only more intelligent than
humans, but also exhibit a significant number of advantages: they will
be faster, more reliable, quicker to learn, more robust, and usually
more accurate.''
Machines would be able to make their own next generation and programme
them.
''I don't believe there is anything to stop robots and machines being
creative in the same way humans are. They could even have emotions,''
said Professor Warwick.
He warned: ''Somebody has to look at whether we should put down a code
of ethics. This will affect the whole of the human race if we just let
it go. It could be a bigger issue than genetics.''

<HEADLINE>Russia condemns Nato air strikes</HEADLINE>

TENSION was growing yesterday over the issue of unleashing yet more
air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs.
As Russia called for an end to the bombing, Nato followed the weekend
Tomahawk cruise missile attack with more strikes.
A squadron of 12 RAF Harrier jump-jets blitzed Serb ammunition dumps
near Sarajevo with 1000lb bombs and four Royal Navy Sea Harriers joined
raids against key targets.
However, one Nato source admitted ''there is a lot of
head-scratching'' over the alliance's apparent inability to force the
Bosnian Serbs to comply with UN demands.
The Security Council has insisted all heavy weapons be withdrawn
outside the exclusion zone declared around Sarajevo, that all UN ''safe
areas'' be guaranteed unconditionally, and that there should be complete
freedom of movement both of people and humanitarian supplies.
Nato commander Admiral Leighton Smith has spoken of launching even
harder attacks, arguing the alliance strategy was a ''graduated
response'' designed to increase pressure until the Serbs caved in.
But crucially he has not said how far the West is willing to go if
Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic refuses to obey the orders of his own
politicians and the international community.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said yesterday in an open letter
to US President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and Prime
Minister John Major: ''Nato has declared war on the Serbs.''
Against this background, Russian envoy Vitaly Churkin emerged from a
Nato meeting in Brussels to say he had asked the alliance to call off
its military operations.
He warned Moscow was ''worried things are getting out of hand'' and
said he had told the session with Nato ambassadors that failure to heed
Moscow's comments could seriously damage the peace process and attempts
by Moscow and the alliance to forge a new relationship.
''We are quite worried and continue to be after this meeting about the
way things are going. We do not see any progress whatsoever towards
improving things in Bosnia Herzegovina,'' he said.
''In our view what is going on now is a very risky thing. Luck is
being pushed, the worry is the luck may run out.''
However, Nato Secretary-General Willy Claes last night flatly rejected
the calls for an immediate end to the bombing.
''Russia is saying they cannot accept Nato military activities. From
that point of view we did not change our point of view at this meeting
or after this meeting,'' he said.
US officials also endorsed the use of Tomahawk missiles and warned
radar-evading ''stealth'' fighters might soon be pressed into action as
well.
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said President Clinton was
determined to do everything possible to ensure the safety of allied
pilots involved in Nato's air campaign.
US envoy Richard Holbrooke briefed President Clinton last night on the
status of efforts to bring peace to Bosnia, and Mr Clinton directed Mr
Holbrooke to return to Europe on Thursday for further peace talks.
Mr Major also gave his full backing to the decision to launch cruise
missiles.
He said: ''We all saw just a few weeks ago what happened when the
Serbs landed a missile right in the middle of the market place and an
awful lot of innocent people were killed.
''The United Nations made it perfectly clear at the time that we
required certain action by the Serbs. That action has not yet been
taken.''
Nato sources said yesterday there was no question at the moment of
moving on to a second range of targets.
One diplomat said Nato's military authorities would not be able to hit
other targets without approval from Brussels and from UN commanders on
the ground.
Meanwhile, Nato diplomats said the alliance appeared to have
overplayed the influence Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic could
exert on Mladic.
''I think there was a feeling once we got Milosevic on board
everything would drop into place,'' said one.
Officials said there was a lot of consultation between capitals under
way to try and bring the peace process back to the fore and prevent Nato
slipping into a state of all-out confrontation with the Serbs.

FORMER Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart was yesterday given the full
support of his constituency party immediately after being fined #200 for a
breach of the peace when confronting protesters in February at the M77
extension site in Glasgow.
While a return to the ministerial ranks, from which he resigned at the start
of the affair, has been ruled out this side of a General Election, he is likely
to play an increasingly prominent part in the Government's campaign to regain
lost ground in Scotland.
Mr Jackson Carlaw, Scottish Tory vice_chairman and a friend of the Eastwood
MP and former president of his local constituency party, made clear: ``Allan's
resignation earlier this year deprived the Scottish Office of one of its most
talented Ministers.
``However, the Government's loss is the party's gain and in the weeks and
months ahead we look forward to Allan deploying his campaigning abilities not
just in Eastwood but throughout Scotland.''
Earlier, Mr Stewart heard Sheriff Colin Higgins at Paisley say he had been
rash and naive in not expecting confrontation when he visited the site. Mr
Stewart later issued a public apology.
As he left Paisley Sheriff Court with his wife, Susie, his son, Gareth, and
his lawyer, Mr Adrian Shinwell, Mr Stewart faced a media scrum intermingled
with a noisy handful of the protesters who had confronted him eight months ago.
Mr Lindsay Keenan, an unemployed member of Scottish Environmental Action and
the man Mr Stewart pushed at the road site in Pollok Castle Estate, Newton
Mearns, said: ``He must clearly resign as an MP for several reasons.
``By pleading guilty in court today he showed he was not being truthful about
his actions immediately after the event. The level of the fine is an absolute
disgrace.''
Mr Stewart would not comment as he left court. But in a statement later he
said he had ``inadvertently breached the law while acting under considerable
provocation from anti_motorway protesters,'' a matter of great regret for which
he apologised. The M77 extension was vital for the safety of his constituents
and the improvement of their environment.
``Not one of the protesters I encountered was a constituent. They were
intruding into our affairs in pursuit of their own agenda,'' he declared.
``All democrats will condemn the behaviour of those who seek by mob rule to
frustrate the will of a democratically_elected local authority and Parliament.
Fortunately they have failed. The M77 extension is going ahead and is on
schedule.''
Mr Ian Muir, the chairman of Mr Stewart's Eastwood constituency party, said
the local party had reaffirmed its fullest support and loyalty for Mr Stewart
whom he described as a ``highly respected, hardworking and loyal MP.''
Mr Stewart yesterday pled guilty through Mr Donald Findlay, QC, to an amended
breach of the peace charge which said he conducted himself in a disorderly
manner at Pollok Castle Estate on February 5, shouted, pushed Lindsay Keenan
and presented a pickaxe.
His son, Jack Gareth Stewart _ known as Gareth _ who was 16 in February, and
his friend, David Clow, also 16 at the time, of Dumbarton Road, Scotstoun, both
appeared in the dock with Mr Stewart and pled guilty to possessing loaded air
pistols at the scene of the same incident in contravention of the Firearms Act.
Sentence was deferred on both youths, now aged 17, for a year against their
good behaviour.
Mr Tom Dysart, depute fiscal, said the background of the incident was the
work on the extension of the M77 through Pollok Estate where protesters had
occupied a derelict building, calling themselves Pollok Free State.
When Mr Stewart's group, which included people working on the site, had
arrived protesters came out of the building, confronting Mr Stewart and his
group.
Mr Dysart said that Mr Stewart had shouted at them: ``Where are you from?''
conduct which they had apparently found intimidating, and confrontation had
ensued between him and Mr Keenan. Mr Stewart had pushed him on the chest,
causing him to stumble.
Mr Stewart had then seen there was potential for more trouble and he and his
group walked away. It was then he came across a pickaxe lying on the site and
he lifted it to shoulder level. The protesters saw this as aggressive and they
were afraid he was going to use it but Mr Stewart had put the pickaxe down. One
of the protesters and one of Mr Stewart's party had called the police.
Because of the poor weather they had gone back to Giffnock Police Station to
take statements and it was there it had come to light that the two boys had
loaded air pistols in holsters under their jackets.
The depute fiscal said that David Clow had said in reply to the police he had
had the gun because ``Mr Stewart said there might be violence.'' Gareth Stewart
had replied to the police he had the gun ``just in case it got out of hand''.
Mr Dysart asked for the weapons to be forfeited.
Mr Findlay said it would have been easy for Mr Stewart as a Minister to have
visited to see the protest for himself with the full panoply of police and
Scottish Office people but rather than take a risk that that kind of entourage
might aggravate the situation he decided to see what was going on for himself.
Mr Keenan, who appeared to be the leader of the protesters asked Mr Stewart
``who the f  he was'', Mr Findlay said, and Mr Stewart had asked him the same
question.
This had led to a shouting match between the two men and Mr Stewart accepted
that he had been wrong to do this.
He walked away when it was clear that no form of sensible dialogue was
possible. Again with hindsight, it was possible to say that when the pickaxe
was drawn to Mr Stewart's attention he should have walked away. He picked it up
to draw attention to the fact it was there and posing the question why it was
there in what was supposed to be a peaceful protest.
People had reacted to it and there was a certain amount of excitement, said
Mr Findlay. If people had been alarmed there was no need to be, but he could
understand that should be so.
Fining Mr Stewart, Sheriff Colin Higgins said he had at the very least acted
ill_advisedly and rashly in the circumstances. He was not entirely able, he
said, to accept counsel's suggestion that Mr Stewart had merely ``presented''
the pickaxe.
``Only someone naive would not have perhaps anticipated a measure of
confrontation and would have been prepared to behave appropriately by acting
sensibly in these circumstances. That did not happen,'' he said.
