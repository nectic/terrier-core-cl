KUWAIT: Britain's GKN Defence is shortly to deliver to Kuwait the
first of more than 250 Desert Warrior armoured fighting vehicles, the
rest of which will be sent over the next three years. The #612m order
signed last year was one of Kuwait's biggest since the 1991 Gulf War.

Leeds may be unable to resist increased offer
SCOTLAND captain Gary McAllister flies out with the national squad
this morning bound for San Marino, but by this summer his final
destination could be Ibrox.
The midfield player's skills won the admiration of Rangers' manager
Walter Smith years ago, and although he has been rebuffed in attempts to
take the 30-year-old away from Leeds United, he remains interested and
determined to succeed.
It is thought that Smith plans to return to Elland Road with a #3m
offer -- #500,000 more than Rangers may have been prepared to pay last
time -- and the chances are Leeds would be unable to resist.
Rangers' midfield would certainly be enhanced by the presence of
McAllister, whose deft touches and sometimes remarkable vision would
also be ideal in European competition.
Signing McAllister, who will earn his thirty-third cap in the
Serravalle Stadium on Wednesday night, would have another benefit other
than his skills, because Rangers would be gaining a top-class performer
as well as a Scot which would make it easier for Smith to play another
foreign player and still cope with UEFA's three non-nationals rule.
As the Scots gathered for a training session at Hampden yesterday,
there was talk of a move to Ibrox also for Blackburn Rovers defender
Colin Hendry, who is enjoying perhaps his best season in English
football. Again being Scottish gives him added appeal.
It is thought they would have to hand over approximately #5m for
McAllister and Hendry, who both have key functions against San Marino.
McAllister's craft will be required to prise open San Marino's defence
which will be densely populated and, with Paul McStay unable to
contribute because of an ankle injury, Scotland must rely even more
heavily than normal on the captain's abilities as well as those of John
Collins.
Brain rather than brawn will be needed in the Serravalle where a draw
would be considered to be a triumph by San Marino, who have scored only
once in four Group 8 matches.
Scotland manager Craig Brown expects the opposition to play in a
1-3-5-1 formation while he will opt for a much more attacking system.
''There is an eagerness about our group of players and it comes from
people like McAllister and Hendry,'' said Brown.
''We will certainly be very positive and I would like a comfortable
win with some good goals. However, when you see the number of people who
will be in their penalty box you will also see how difficult it will be
to work a way through.''
Progress will not be attempted only through the middle, and Pat Nevin
will be granted his twenty-fifth cap and the silver medal which comes
with reaching the halfway point towards the SFA's hall of fame. The
Tranmere Rovers player, whose subtlety and skills have been used
sparingly, will start the match in the hope of taking defenders out of
position and creating space for forwards one of whom will be Duncan
Shearer.
''Nevin will take a bit of watching and Shearer is very bright and
aggressive even though his club, Aberdeen, have problems,'' Brown said.
The manager won't neglect the need for vigilance in San Marino and
Alan McLaren as well as Hendry will be well briefed and reminded that
England lost a goal after only 10 seconds when they played San Marino in
a World Cup qualifying tie a couple of seasons ago.
The senior side will be given an idea of what it will be like for them
when they watch the under-21s play tomorrow night and their manager,
Tommy Craig, said yesterday he would use width with Brian McLaughlin on
the right, and Neil McCann on the left, to break down the opposition.
The young Scots have nine points from four matches so far and are in
second place in a group from which only one will qualify.
The Finnish under-21s, who beat the Scots in Helsinki, have maximum
points from the same number of games but they have still to play in
Scotland.
* RANGERS and Scotland goalkeeper Andy Goram took a major step on the
comeback trail after a calf operation in January when he played the full
90 minutes of his club's 2-2 draw in a friendly at Queen of the South
yesterday.
''I just need some games under my belt now. I was just down to play
one half of this match but after the first 45 minutes I felt no problems
and played on,'' he said.
Striker Ally McCoist -- also due to play after being out for most of
the season with a variety of injuries -- pulled out after feeling some
pain in his ankle when kicking a ball.
* DUNDEE United teenager Steve Fallon will captain Scotland as they
meet England today in the European Youth championship finals in Belgium.
Midfielder Fallon is the son of former Clydebank defender Jim, who is
now coach at Dumbarton. Later this week Scotland will meet Portugal and
Slovakia hoping that they will get through to the final later next week.
Scotland: Cook (Rangers), Bryson (Aberdeen), Borland (Celtic), Fallon
(Dundee United), Watt (Rangers), Galloway (St Mirren), McBride (Celtic),
Easton (Dundee United), Graham (Rangers), Young (Rangers), Thompson
(Dundee United).

TO Pollok Park for the smack of leather on wood. No, not more arrests
on the M77 protest frontline but a bit of cricket at Poloc.
As a youngster living in the South Side, I was always intrigued at how
come such an upmarket sporting concern couldn't even spell their own
name. Then we learned that they were so upmarket they were using the
original 14th-century version, as used in the title Barony of Poloc.
This cricket club was all too posh for us local urchins. Despite the
urgings of our teacher Bob Crampsey that we give cricket a go, we were
too busy kicking a tanner ba' against the park railings and trying to be
the next Pat Crerand.
Anyway, received opinion was that Poloc was very WASP in its approach
and membership profile. Not so, one of the older members told me over a
beer during Saturday's friendly match with Kilmarnoc (sorry,
Kilmarnock). In fact, as much as 15 years ago, their
championship-winning team didn't have a white Scottish Proddie until
number seven in the batting order, the opening players being a Jew, a
couple of Catholics, two Asians, and an Englishman.
There is nothing more pleasant of an afternoon than to be at a cricket
match, watch the occasional over, and have the senior members meander
through the club history. Poloc has been going since 1878, and occupies
a particularly beautiful site at Shawholm, within the Pollok estate.
The ground was granted over by Sir John Stirling-Maxwell at a
peppercorn rent on the condition that the club's activities did not
spoil the tranquility of the park, which was, up intil the 1960s, still
a private family estate.
The club history relates that the Poloc members managed to fit in a
fair bit of social whirl around the sporting fixtures.
In the 1920s, it was all flappers and chaps in straw boaters and the
odd sherry was taken. So much so that one member, making his way home
out of the estate, became involved in an altercation with the butler
from the big house and clouted him.
The Poloc secretary was summoned by Sir John and asked to account for
the member's lamentable behaviour. The secrtary explained that the chap
had been out all day watching cricket and was suffering from sunstroke.
Sir John believed him.
There is also the tale of one Hutton Bremner, who was a member of the
club in 1930. His day job was playing inside-forward for Motherwell FC.
Hutton was included in the line-up for a charity showbiz cricket match
at which the atmosphere was festive. When it came Hutton's turn to bat,
he was lofted a gentle high ball to get him off the mark. For some
unaccountable reason, Hutton chose to rise, header the cricket ball past
short square leg, and collapse on the wicket.
It's an unusual kind of cricket club, Poloc. They also have a golf
course built around their pitch. It consists of six holes,
criss-crossing the wicket area, and all within view of the clubhouse.
This could be the way ahead for golf, except that the zealots who are
members of the Poloc golf section insist on playing round three times.
The club is officially recognised by the R&amp;A who sent them a telegram
on their centenary in 1989. A past captain of the Wee Poloc golf club is
Ernie Walker, godfather of Scottish football.
But cricket is the main pursuit and Poloc are holding their own in the
Tom Shields Western Union League. (The Western Union is actually
sponsored by chartered surveyors D.M. Hall but I have paid for four
property surveys by them in the last three months so I feel entirely
justified in claiming some sponsorship limelight.)
Poloc have been getting the better in recent years of Clydesdale,
their near neighbours with whom they have an Old Firm-style rivalry.
Poloc's Keith Richardson was last year named best Scottish all-rounder.
Ian Holton, an Australian doctor and handy chap with a bat now working
in Glasgow, has joined and is looking promising.
But like any Scottish cricket club, they are looking to rear their own
talent. They have arrangements with local schools to develop mini-minor
teams.
Poloc welcomes any kid from any background to come along to their
junior coaching classes. There cannot be many better ways for a Pollok
kid to spend a summer's evening than learning cricket at Poloc.

GREATER GREENSBORO OPEN
AMERICAN Jim Gallagher continued a local tradition when he came from
seven shots off the pace to win this event in North Carolina yesterday.
The tournament is renowned for producing come-from-behind winners, and
so it proved again as Gallagher shot a closing six-under-par 66 on a
cold day at Forest Oaks.
Not since 1991, when it happened here and at Houston, had anyone
overcome such a large deficit on the final day. Gallagher recorded a
14-under 274 total, which proved good enough for a one-shot triumph over
fellow Americans Peter Jacobsen (72) and Jeff Sluman (74).
Jacobsen, seeking his third win of the year, was two strokes clear
with five to play, but he faltered down the stretch. Needing a par at
the last to force a play-off, he pushed his approach shot into a bunker
and did not get close enough and made bogey.
Sluman, the overnight leader, also had a chance to tie with Gallagher,
but his chip shot for birdie lipped out.
While Jacobsen received $132,000 to go to the top of this year's US
Tour money list, it was Gallagher who celebrated his fourth US Tour
victory. ''When I bogeyed six and seven I thought I had done myself
in,'' said Gallagher, who collected $270,000.
''I only missed three fairways. I kept it in play and gave myself a
chance. I putted well, which I haven't done for a long time.''
As Gallagher mentioned, bogeys at the sixth and seventh could have
been costly, but five birdies in the final eight holes was enough for
victory.
Swede Jesper Parnevik shot even-par 72 to finish sixth, four strokes
behind. The British Open runner-up never launched a charge, but battled
on for a confidence-boosting result. Final scores (USA unless stated):
274 -- J Gallagher 69, 70, 69, 66.
275 -- P Jacobsen 69, 65, 69, 72; J Sluman 70, 65, 66, 74.
276 -- J Adams 70, 66, 70, 70.
277 -- M Calcavecchia 68, 73, 67, 69.
278 -- J Parnevik (Sweden) 70, 68, 68, 72.
279 -- G Boros 73, 67, 70, 69; T Tryba 69, 70, 69, 71; S Stricker 68,
73, 66, 72; B Faxon 65, 71, 71, 72; V Singh (Fiji) 65, 72, 69, 73.
280 -- F Zoeller 70, 71, 70, 69; H Sutton 67, 68, 74, 71.
Other scores included:
295 -- D Feherty (N Ireland) 69, 73, 76, 77.

CRICKET ROUND-UP
THE hope had been that Scotland would at least give Worcestershire a
run for their money in yesterday's Benson &amp; Hedges Cup at New Road.
Instead, it turned into a one-horse race, won by a distance -- and at a
canter -- by the county side, the margin a humiliating 10 wickets.
Hopefully, the Scots can gather themselves for the visit of Derbyshire
to Titwood tomorrow. But, on the evidence of yesterday, another
hammering could be on the card.
The Scots were struggling before a ball was bowled when Director of
Cricket Jim Love -- doubling as captain during the B&amp;H campaign --
called off ill.
Alastair Storie was installed as skipper, with George Reifer pushed
down to No.3.
Worcestershire won the toss and inserted the visitors. In the fourth
over Steve Crawley had a slash at a ball from Tom Moody and found Neal
Radford at first slip.
With the score on 16, Reifer also found the locals gathered behind,
England wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes producing an excellent diving catch.
Mike Smith stroked the first boundary of the innings -- in the
fourteenth over -- off Moody but the wickets continued to fall, Storie
chopping the second ball of Stuart Lampitt's spell straight at Moody in
the gully.
Smith helped himself to three boundaries -- two off benefit-season man
Radford, who then gained revenge, with Rhodes the catcher.
In strolled Scotland's ''hired-hand'' -- former West Indian Test star
Malcolm Marshall, but he soon played on to man-of-the-match Radford for
just 2.
Scotland limped to 75 for seven off 39 overs by lunch, and lost two
more wickets before David Haggo and Kevin Thomson had a stand of 35 -- a
Scottish record for the tenth wicket in this cup -- to take the total
into three figures.
The county side never looked in any danger of failing in their chase
of 119, both openers clocking up 50s. Scoreboard:

CANNES OPEN
SWITZERLAND'S Andre Bossert won the Air France Cannes Open without
hitting a ball at Royal Mougins yesterday when the final day's play was
washed out. Torrential rain which had forced a nine-hour delay on
Saturday returned and prevented a resumption of the third round.
So 31-year-old Bossert, leader by two after two rounds with a
10-under-par total of 132, was declared the winner in the first European
tour event to be cut to 36 holes since the 1984 Monte Carlo Open. ''I
thought I had the game to win, but I will take it coming like this -- a
win is a win,'' said the Johannesburg-born player, the seventh man to
achieve a maiden Volvo Tour victory in 12 tournaments this season.
Prize-money was cut by 25% because of the loss of the last two rounds,
giving Bossert #37,500 rather than #50,000 and joint runners-up Jean Van
de Velde, of France, and Oyvind Rojahn, a Norwegian rookie, #19,541
each. The Ryder Cup points allocation was similarly affected.
Most disappointed players were Essex's Jon Robson and Scot Adam
Hunter. They moved into a share of second place when the third round did
eventually start yesterday, but fell back to sixth and tenth
respectively when the round was wiped out. However, Andrew Coltart, the
Scottish Professional champion, picked up #10,387 for finishing joint
fourth and moves up to fifth in the order of merit and eighteenth in the
Ryder Cup table, two places behind Hunter.
Colin Montgomerie stays second in the table after finishing joint
thirteenth, while Ian Woosnam, joint twenty-first in the defence of his
title, remains seventh.
The washout gave Welshman Mark Mouland a reprieve. He slept through
his alarm call and would have been disqualified otherwise. Leading
scores (British or Irish unless stated):
132 -- A Bossert (Switzerland) 65, 67 (#37,500).
134 -- J van de Velde (France) 64, 70; O Rojahn (Norway) 67, 67
(#19,541 each).
135 -- A Coltart 66, 69; D Gilford 70, 65 (#10,387 each).
136 -- O Sellberg (Sweden) 66, 70; M Gronberg (Sweden) 64, 72; J
Robson 67, 69; D Hospital (Spain) 66, 70.
137 -- R Boxall 67, 70; A Hunter 68, 69; D Robertson 68, 69.
Other scores included: 138 -- C Montgomerie 68, 70; R Drummond 70, 68.
140 -- I Woosnam 67, 73; M Miller 70, 70. 142 -- S Torrance 70, 72. 143

BOXING
AN overweight George Foreman, at 46 the oldest heavyweight champion in
history, held on to his International Boxing Federation title at Las
Vegas on Saturday night.
However, Foreman's doddering, stumbling performance against Germany's
Axel Schulz was indeed, a sad sight to see.
It is difficult to tell whether Schulz can take a great punch, but he
deserves a great deal of credit for his courage in not being intimidated
by Foreman.
Time and again the 26-year-old Schulz answered Foreman's lumbering
punches with quick combinations to the head, or even slugged it out with
the behemoth, who had won the title with one tenth-round sledgehammer
right hand to Michael Moorer's face.
Several times the 16st 12lb Foreman caught Schulz, landing jackhammer
jabs and thudding right to the German's head that seemed to shake the
entire ring. Some of Foreman's body punches to the side began to crumple
the German like an aluminum beer can.
Any number of those right hands seemed identical to the one that
stopped Moorer and steered Foreman to the title.
But Schulz, outweighed by 35 pounds, would right himself and
re-inflate his body to come back with his own combinations.
Schulz, who suffered a minor cut on his forehead, landed punches so
often that by the ninth round Foreman's left eye was nearly swollen shut
from a lump the size of a golf ball.
Foreman said he heard the crowd chanting ''USA, USA, USA'' in the
eleventh round in response to the German fans shouting ''Axel, Axel
Axel.''
Foreman, a preacher when not fighting, said the theme of his Sunday
sermon would be to ''make sure you make good friends. I heard that chant
'USA' and it made me stop looking for one punch. It made me fight. That
chant probably made me win the fight.
''I love this country.''
Foreman, who made 10 million dollars, should also love the three
American judges. They gave him the benefit of the doubts of many
ringsiders that he won the 12-round fight against Schulz, who was so
under-appreciated beforehand that some people promoting the fight could
not spell his name correctly.
Judges Jerry Roth scored it 115-113, Keith Macdonald had it 115-113
and Chuck Giampa saw it even 114-114.
Some television viewers thought Foreman's friends were, indeed,
judging the fight and swamped the hotel switchboard to challenge the
decision.
Foreman tried to make excuses for his performance and claimed Schulz,
butted him.
Schulz said, through an interpreter: ''I scored the points, but I also
had to fight against the referee and judges. I hope George will give me
a rematch in Germany.''
Foreman, asked if he planned to retire, said: ''I'm gonna fight until
I can't fight anymore.''
* WILSON Docherty, the featherweight from Condorrat, is still hurting
three months after losing on points to Paisley's Michael Devaney for the
vacant British title. Tonight, though, he can take the first positive
step towards another chance when he meets Peter Harris, of Swansea, in a
championship eliminator at the St Andrew's Sporting Club in Glasgow,
writes Jim Reynolds.
''I thought I had beaten Michael, but the verdict went against me,''
he said. ''It was the worst moment of my career and I don't ever want to
feel disappointment like that again. I felt I had let so many people
down, because I wasn't at my best. Now I have the chance to make up for
it and I don't aim to blow it.''
Docherty still believes he can join brother Drew, the British
bantamweight title-holder as a champion, and knows that he must win
tonight against a man of vast experience.
The Scot, however, goes into this fight, with the confidence of having
already beaten Harris in Cardiff last August when he boxed superbly to
outpoint the Welshman.
Light-middleweight Billy Collins, of Stirling, is out for his fifth
straight win as a professional when he meets Phil Epton, of Doncaster.
Another two young Scots also put their unbeaten records on the line.
At welter, Tranent's Tommy Quinn, brother of Willie, has won his first
two pro contests inside the distance and now takes on Birmingham's Billy
McDougall. At light, Robert Hay, from Coatbridge, should follow up his
professional debut victory by beating Paul Quarmby, of Hetton.

DAVID Coulthard will ease himself into the cockpit of his Williams
Renault at Imola on Sunday and attempt to win the first grand prix of
his career. When the lights change to green, his car will accelerate
from nought to 90kph in under two seconds.
There will be times in the race, the third of the Formula One season,
when man and manchine will pass in a blur at around 330kph.
Do not let anyone tell you this sport is not exciting or exacting.
Grand prix racing is more than a collection of highly-paid drivers going
around in circles because their sport demands strengths which are beyond
lesser mortals.
Drivers are courageous, dedicated, and fit, even though Nigel
Mansell's problem of fitting his hips into his McLaren caused hilarity
and cost his team in extra finance and round-the-clock work to widen the
cockpit. In fact, a grand prix driver has to live by a regime of eating
and exercising which is geared to making his body and cardiovascular
system strong enough to withstand the rigours of racing which often are
severe.
In the season's first grand prix, in Brazil, Frenchman Jean Alesi
hauled himslef out of his Ferrari after having taken third place and
complained that, for the last few laps, he was barely able to hold on to
the steering wheel.
During the Canadian Grand Prix last year, Coulthard started going
backwards before the end and finished fifth because of a loss of feeling
in his right foot. There was nothing to be done. He couldn't feel the
throttle or the brake, but he couldn't get out to relieve the pain.
The pain barrier is just one of the many he will have to break through
this season if he wishes to hold on to his job with one of the sport's
top four teams. His employers are not interested in his suffering. They
want results.
These drivers labour under the misconception that they are all paid
millions of pounds to perform, but that is not the case, with only a
small number of them in that fortunate position.
Coulthard and the others will start arriving at Imola in midweek to
begin preparations for the first of the European grands prix, the San
Marino, on Sunday and he will be staying not too far from the Scottish
football side who play San Marino in a European Championship qualifying
tie on Wednesday night.
The driver had to decline an official invitation to watch the match
because in the days before a race, he is locked into a routine which he
dare not break. He will study the circuit, fret over alterations to his
car hoping nothing mechanical will stop him as it did in the Argentinian
race a couple of weeks back, and he and his team will plan their race
strategy with a precision which would make Craig Brown's plans for his
match seem haphazard.
All the while Coulthard and the other drivers will be haunted by the
memory of Imola last year, when two drivers lost more than races. Ayrton
Senna, perhaps the best driver the sport has produced, died the day
after Roland Ratzenberger had been killed in practice.
The chances are that if any driver dwells too long on these deaths, or
any of the others which have occurred in F1, the chances of him
suffering a similar fate will increase significantly. When the safe
completion of a race might depend on a driver's ability to live for a
few hours in cramped conditions, fighting against pain while making
split-second decisions and up to 2000 gear changes, total concentration
is essential.
The drivers are alone in a high-speed world trying to win points and
races with the possibility of injury and all to often death only one
lapse removed.
It is a sharp contrast from the world of footballers, most of whom run
the risk of suffering nothing more severe than a broken bone. In fact,
as a group of footballers gather in San Marino they might spare a
thought for Coulthard and his colleagues. They also might take a close
look at the Scottish driver who conducts himself with a humility rarely
experienced in football.

THE gritty determination of Alan McManus was not enough to make up for
a lack of consistently good form recently, as the Scot last night bowed
out of the Embassy World Championship to Nigel Bond, who eventually
shook him off 13-10 to complete the quarter-final line-up.
It was a first win for Bond in eight meetings with McManus, who had
been encouraged by a 10-3 first-round victory over fellow Scot John
Higgins. He won the first frame on Saturday afternoon but was mostly in
arrears by one or two frames, although he four times drew level.
Resuming at 8-8, Bond won the first two frames last night and
maintained that advantage at the interval. The Scot reduced the gap to
10-11 but that was his last success.
Jimmy White, bidding to reach his sixth world final in a row, reached
the quarter-finals for a twelfth successive year but admitted: ''I
cannot possibly win the tournament the way I'm playing.'' The
32-year-old Londoner had a 13-7 victory against Derby's David Roe after
having established a 7-1 lead on Saturday, largely helped by Roe's
indifferent play.
Roe did fight back to 6-9 and 7-10 before White reeled off the last
three frames. He now meets John Parrott in a quarter-final rematch of
their 1991 final that Parrott won to interrupt Scot Stephen Hendry's run
of world titles.
Parrott secured a fighting victory by taking six of the last seven
frames for a 13-11 success over Irishman Joe Swail.
Despite two centuries, two more breaks in the nineties, and a host of
other big breaks Parrott needed an outrageous fluke to set him up.
He had trailed the world No.12 throughout, coming from 10-7 down to
level up at 10-10. He went behind again at 11-10 only to draw level at
11-11.
Then came his moment of good fortune. Needing two of the last three
colours he fluked the blue then potted the pink to lead for the first
time at 12-11.
Willie Thorne yesterday called for a review of the rule book after he
lost 13-7 to left-hander Andy Hicks.
Thorne blamed a decision by referee John Williams in Saturday's night
final frame. As the players indulged in a cat-and-mouse game of rolling
the cue-ball into, and away from, what was left of the pack of reds,
Williams warned that he would give them eight more shots apiece before
re-racking.
Immediately Hicks fluffed a shot while using the rest and Thorne then
failed an attempt at a risky plant. Hicks came back to compile a 64
clearance and take a decisive grip with a 10-6 overnight lead. He
dropped only one more frame yesterday morning to earn a quarter-final
meeting with Peter Ebdon.
''Rules are made to be broken,'' claimed Thorne. ''They were written
for situations when there are 15 reds on the table -- not when a man is
nearly 60 points up.''

JOHN Campbell, for many years Scottish golf correspondent of the Daily
and Sunday Telegraph and also a regular contributor to The Herald, has
died aged 83 after having been in poor health for some time. His wide
knowledge of the game made him a respected and readable commentator.
Campbell was a semi-finalist and quarter-finalist in the 1947 and 1948
Amateur Championships respectively. In these same years he played for
Scotland in the home international matches and in 1952 he won the West
of Scotland championship.

GLASGOW'S Simon Yates landed the $50,000 Coca-Cola Open in Shenzen in
China on Saturday, producing a stirring late comeback to pip New
Zealand's David Smail to the $9000 first prize in the fourth and final
event of the inaugural Volvo China Tour.
Two shots behind with just four holes to play, the Scot tamed windy
conditions at the Mission Hills Golf Club to finish with a one-under-par
71 across the 6970-yard Jack Nicklaus-designed course and a two-round
aggregate of 140.
The win moves Yates to second position in the Chinese Volvo Order of
Merit behind local player Zhang Lian Wei and means he will compete in
Beijing next week in the $400,000 Volvo China Open.
Yates said: ''This is the biggest win of my life and I now hope I can
do well in Beijing. I've never experienced anything quite like that in
my life.'' Leading scores:
140 -- S Yates (Scotland) 69, 71. 141 -- D Smail (New Zealand) 67, 74.
143 -- M Kadir (Malaysia) 72, 71; M Welch (England) 71, 72. 144 -- C

Harvey 78, 73.
* COWGLEN'S Les McLaughlin narrowly missed out on a double win in the
Glasgow Spring Meeting at Cawder on Saturday, winning the scratch prize
by eight strokes but losing the handicap section by a single stroke.
Leading scores:
Scratch: 141 -- L McLaughlin (Cowglen) 71, 70. 149 -- C Kelly (Cawder)
75, 74; N MacRae (Cawder) 73, 76. Handicap: 142 -- N McKenzie (Cawder,

* PETER McLeod, of Alloa, tamed strong winds across his home course to
lift the Clackmannan Spring Meeting on Saturday with a gross round of 73
which was three-over-par but matched the day's standard scratch score.
Leading scores:
Scratch: 73 -- P McLeod (Alloa). 74 -- J Gullane (Tillicoultry); D
Abernethy (Alloa). Handicap: 68 -- S Kerr (Alloa, 10) bih; D Miller
(Tulliallan, 10); B Povey (Braehead, 11).
* HENRY Anderson, of the Police, matched the par of 70 at Glenbervie
on Saturday to win the Stirlingshire Spring Meeting in wet and windy
conditions. His score was two below the day's standard scratch score and
the same margin clear of Jim Leishman of Falkirk. Leading scores:
Scratch: 70 -- H Anderson (Police). 72 -- J Leishman (Falkirk).
Handicap: 68 -- R Thorburn (Bonnybridge, 12); D W Crawford (Grangemouth,

* A REPEAT of last year's Perth and Kinross Boys Matchplay
championship final was dashed at the semi-final stage at Crieff
yesterday when holder Colin Mitchell, of Blairgowrie, was defeated by
clubmate Ross McKay and former beaten finalist Andrew Whyte of Muckhart
went out to Alec Forsyth. Results:
Semi-finals -- A Forsyth (Muckhart) beat A Whyte (Muckhart), 3 and 2;

SWIMMING
GRAEME Smith completed a victory double at the trials in Sheffield
with a record-breaking swim in the 400m freestyle and will be a lone
Scot in the British team at the European championships in Vienna in
August.
The qualifying curtain came down yesterday, and the other hopeful
Scots were on the wrong side. Fraser Walker was sixth in the 100m
backstroke final and then withdrew from yesterday's 400m medley heats.
But for Smith, the event produced further evidence of his world-class
ability. With his first European appearance already secure following
Friday's win in the 1500m freestyle, he held off British record-holder
Paul Palmer to win the 400m in 3min.54.15.sec.
The time was more than four seconds inside his best, and sliced two
seconds from the Scottish record set by Paisley's Campbell McNeil in
1989.
The next generation of teenagers, Paul Latimer, Nicola Steel, Richard
Hope, and his sister, Kirsty, did well to make finals, but are still not
threatening to reach British senior level. Results:
Men. 400m medley -- 1, D Warren (City of Leeds) 4-26.34; 2, B Lafferty
(City of Leeds) 4-26.42; 3, C Jones (City of Cardiff) 4-29.41; 8, P
Latimer (Stockport Metro) 4-41.74. 200m backstroke -- 1, A Ruckwood
(City of Birmingham) 1-59.52; 2, M Harris (Waltham Forest) 2-03.22; 3, J
Salter (City of Birmingham) 2-05.88; 5, R Hope (Warrender) 2-06.99. 50m
freestyle -- 1, M Foster (City of Cardiff) 22.75; 2, M Fibbens
(Hatfield) 23.17; 3, M Carl (Redbridge Boro) 23.18.
Women. 200m freestyle -- 1, K Pickering (Ipswich) 2-01.82; 2, A
Bennett (Nova Centurion) 2-02.86; 3, C Huddart (City of Leeds) 2-03.28.
100m backstroke -- 1, E Tattam (Portsmouth Northsea) 1-04.22; 2, K Osher
(Ealing) 1-04.37; 3, Z Cray (Ipswich) 1-04.48; 6, K Hope (City of
Dundee) 1-05.57; 8, N Steel (Aberdeen) 1-06.25. 100m butterfly --

TWO world records, by George Hilley, the world masters champion from
Langcroft, were the highlight of the British masters championships at
Easterhouse on Saturday.
Making their first appearance in the sport, the newly-formed City of
Glasgow squad took six British titles, also establishing three UK
records and 19 Scottish ones.
A case will now be made for backing for the six champions to compete
at the World Masters event which begin in Vienna on August 31. All
achieved the qualifying total.
Hilley, lifting at 59k, snatched a world best of 75k, and equalled the
jerk record of 97.5k for a new record total, while Scotland's other
world masters champion, John McNiven (Springburn, 64k) the former double
Commonwealth medallist, now 58, set the three UK bests as he totalled
157.5k.
Alex Richardson (Easterhouse, 76k) made seven Scottish records as he
totalled 220k, setting himself up for the European championships in
Gdansk next month. The other title winners were Willie Wilson (Lancroft,
91k), Ian Burke (Langcroft, 83k), and Jim Ferguson (Easterhouse, over
108k).

THE train journey to Edinburgh revealed as much about tennis in
Scotland as the mannner of Ross Matheson's welcome-victory in the first
tournament to be hosted at Craiglockhart's revamped #3.1m national
centre.
In the packed coaches there were many destined to worship at the
Murrayfield shrine's final appearance of debenture Messiah Gavin
Hastings. No sign of tennis enthusiasts. But the rugby crowd was vastly
outnumbered by Trekkies, bound for the capital's Star Trek exhibition.
Behind the decision to boldly go ahead with the Craiglockhart
investment -- a fine arena -- is the laudable motive of making tennis
more accessible to the masses.
But in clinging on to the notion that the sport's domestic problems
may be resolved by better facilities, a more fundamental issue is being
ignored, namely the one exemplified by the ultimate destinations of the
rail passengers.
Tennis is weary of a game which is dominated by serves with the
blast-off force of Starship Enterprise.
Anything that could be described as a rally was a rarity as the 6ft
5ins Matheson, whose serve most recently was measured at 119 mph,
launched them with awesome precision.
Matheson, Scotland's top-ranked player, beat Yorkshire's Gary
Henderson
6-7, 7-5, 6-3 in the final of the Reebok Scottish Tour competition,
collecting #650 for his efforts. The event had been switched indoors
from the new-laid clay which is still slightly soft, and a decision as
to whether this week's tour event will be indoors or out has yet to be
taken.
Though he lost the opening set on a tie break, Matheson never
surrendered a service game, and, indeed, was broken only once in four
matches in the tournament.
But his game, for all its awesome power -- closely matched by that of
Henderson -- is hardly conducive to attracting crowds. ''Boring'' and
''soporific'' were two words overheard in the aftermath, and that was
from enthusiasts.
Matheson, world-ranked 263 and sixth in Britain, held break point in
the opening set, but UK No.8 Henderson survived, then took the tie-break
7-5.
However, Matheson took his next five games to love while making 22
successive service points without reply. ''If I serve as well as that, I
am going to be tough to beat this year,'' said Matheson, whose last
appearance at Craiglockhart, six years ago, brought a 6-3, 6-1 defeat by
John McEnroe, and an invitation from the American to help him prepare
for Wimbledon.
Matheson served 11 aces to Henderson's 17, and three double faults
(all in one game in which he also served three aces) to Henderson's two.
The pair could meet again this week. Henderson has moved into a
caravan, to conserve funds, an indication of the gulf between this level
and the one to which he and Matheson aspire.
To make that move to the higher echelons, Matheson needs to
concentrate on his service return, a deficency exposed more on the fast
indoor surface than it will be on clay.
In the women's final, Russian Federation Cup player Julia Lutrova
reversed the outcome of last weekend's Reebok Tour final when she beat
Oxfordshire teenager Lizzie Jelfs. Lutrova, who eliminated Scotland's
Michele Mair in the semis, won 6-3, 7-5.

YACHTING
DAVID Miles yesterday won the final race in Class 1 of the Kip Marina
Spring Series off Inverkip in his Etechells, Stormpig.
The boat has just returned from England's south coast where a new keel
and deck have been fitted.
Yesterday's opposition was limited to a handful of bigger, handicap
racing boats, but in a blustery north-westerly breeze, Miles showed the
pace required to beat Bateleur by two minutes.
Overall series winner in Class 1 was Salamander XII, John Corson's
J35, which had taken two first places with local sailmaker John Highcock
steering, but dropped to a sixth place in the final race. But this was
sufficient to win the four-race series from Bateleur.
Off Largs a fleet of six identical new Slovenian-built Sigma 8 Metre
One-designs was launched by Regatta Team Scotland, with the Iolair Forth
yacht club's team championships which was contested over five races.
With three windward-leeward races sailed on Saturday then two triangle
courses yesterday the dinghy sailors of Dalgety Bay Sailing Club -- led
by helm Ian Calder amassed three victories and two second places to hold
off runners-up Port Edgar Yacht Club skippered by Jock Blair. Results:
Iolaird Forth Yacht Club's Team Championships -- 1, Dalgety Bay
Sailing Club; 2, Port Edgar Yacht Club; 3, East Lothian Yacht Club.
Kip Marina Spring Series Race 5 -- 1, Stormpig (D Miles)d 2-00.05; 2,
Bateleur (C Bonar) 2-02.16; 3, Looney Tunes (I Cameron) 2-02.56.
Class 2 -- 1, Kooshtie (G Campbell) 1-17.00; 2, Snot Rag (K Marshall)
1-17.20; 3, Troy (R Sutherland) 1-21.20.
Overall -- 1, Salamander (J Corson); 2, Bateleur; 3, Moonshine (J
Fowler).

COMMONWEALTH sprinters Ian Mackie and Doug Walker ended the opening
day of the Scottish men's league yesterday on their knees -- wretching
after a gruelling day's sprinting in the division-one match at
Coatbridge.
But, if this pair's rivalry continues, they could inspire one another
to a glorious future.
Mackie, from Pitreavie, stunned Walker in the 100 metres, beating the
Edinburgh AC runner who held six British professional titles at one
stage last year. Despite cold conditions, and a stiff headwind, Mackie
crossed the line in 10.80 -- with Walker timed at 11.00.
Powerful, and filled out after his first winter's weights work, the
20-year-old Mackie should comfortably make Britain's under-23 team to
face France.
In passing, it is worth noting the performance in the B-string event
by another prodigious talent, Andy Lees, just 15, who won in 11.40.
Edinburgh student Walker had comprehensive revenge in the 200m, in
which he reached the Commonwealth semis in Victoria. Blessed with the
advantage of the lane inside the Fifer, he was just clear coming off the
bend, and strode home more comfortably than the official margin of 20.3
to 21.5 suggests.
Walker's major target this year is just a fortnight away -- the
British Universities Championships on his home track at Meadowbank.
Victory guarantees a place at the World Student Games in Fukuoka, Japan,
later this year.
Inverness's Dave Barnetson was a double winner, taking the high jump
with 1.95m and high hurdles in 15.9.
Glen Stewart had a fine solo 1500m victory for Edinburgh Southern, in
3-47.9, while Kilbarchan's Robert Quinn took the 5000m in 14-16.6.
Inverness thrower Dave Allan had an outstanding start to the season,
winning the hamme with 58.92m, and Mel Fowler, having travelled from
Skye, took the triple jump with 14.30m.
Despite only a single victory in the 20 events (Peter McDevitt, 800m,
1-57.7) Shettleston won the match, 28 points clear of Pitreavie, a
useful start to the defence of the title won by the Glasgow club last
year.
Clydesdale began their promotion bid from division two in fine style.
Notable among their winners was Ewan Calvert who took the 800m in
1-53.7, and Grant Graham (1500m, 3-50.4).
In the match involving divisions three, four, and five, at Wishaw,
Victoria Park teenager Ross Baillie set a third division record of 10.9
for the 100m, running against the elements. He also clocked 15.1 to win
the 110m hurldes.
Chris Smith (Arbroath) had Scotland's best throw of the year to date
in the javelin, 57.90m, also a division record. Details:
Division 1: 1, Shettleston 357 points; 2, BT Pitreavie 329; 3,
Scottish Borders 307[1/2]; 4, Aberdeen 304; 5, Edinburgh AC 284; 6,
Inverness 260; 7, Edinburgh SH 222; 8, Falkirk Victoria 183[1/2].

WALKER Cup squad man Barclay Howard showed his class at Bellshill
yesterday to run out a five-stroke victor in the West of Scotland
championship.
The 42-year-old Cochrane Castle veteran laid the groundwork with a
morning round of five-under-par 66 in testing conditions, which gave him
a four-shot cushion over Scottish cap colleague Graham Rankin. He
consolidated with a level-par 71 in the afternoon.
Paul Burke, of the host club, holed his No.5-iron shot at the 154-yard
seventeenth. Leading scores:
137 -- B Howard (Cochrane Castle) 66, 71.
142 -- G Rankin (Palacerigg) 70, 72.
143 -- D Blair (Bothwell Castle) 72, 71; I Serrals (Hollandbush) 71,
72.
144 -- J Smith (Strathclyde Park) 71, 73; B Smith (Hamilton) 71, 73.
145 -- D Park (Wishaw) 71, 74.
146 -- S Inglis (Falkirk) 77, 69.
* SCOTTISH internationalist Craig Hislop came from behind to notch his
first victory in the Shamash Trophy at Stranraer yesterday. He trailed
Callum White, of New Galloway, by five shots at lunch after his opening
78, but in windy conditions his afternoon 69 wrapped up the title by two
strokes. Leading scores:
147 -- C Hislop (Powfoot) 78, 69.
149 -- A Cunningham (Stranraer) 74, 75.
153 -- R O'Keefe (Stranraer) 78, 75.
154 -- I Reid (Dumfries &amp; Galloway) 77, 77.
155 -- B Scott (Lochmaben) 78, 77; C White (New Galloway) 73, 82.
* AYRSHIRE warmed up for their Area Team championship first-round
clash with the North-East in four weeks with a 9-3 win in their friendly
with Argyll &amp; Bute at Cowal yesterday.
Led by Scottish amateur champion Hugh McKibbin, the visitors went to
lunch 3-1 ahead. They carried the advantage through the afternoon
singles, winning five of the eight ties.

* STIRLING &amp; Clackmannan beat East Lothian 3-1 in the East of Scotland

BOWLS
SCOTLAND defeated England in the last round of the triples event at
the Atlantic Rim women's outdoor championships at Durban, South Africa,
yesterday.
In a good match, Liz Dickson, Eleanor Allan, and Janice Maxwell turned
an 8-13 deficit into a 20-14 victory, and denied Mary Price's English
trio the bronze medal, which went instead to Jersey.
The scores were level at the seventh end but the Scots then conceded a
4, and trailed 8-13 after 11 ends. They then collected two trebles, a
double, and a single to lead 17-13 and, although dropping a single on
the sixteenth end, eased home 20-14 with a single and a double.
The Scots suffered a blow against Israel, who triumphed 18-15 in the
pairs and forced a 17-17 tie in the triples.
Victory in the pairs and triples went to the host nation.
Lorna Trigwell and Jo Peacock finished five points clear of their
nearest rivals, England's Gill Fitzgerald and Norma Shaw, while in the
triples event, Colleen Grondein skipped Lyn Dwyer and Hester Bekker
success using borrowed woods after hers were stolen last weekend.
SCOTS-BORN Mark McMahon won the Mazda Tweed Classic in Gold Coast,
Australia, when he defeated Kelvin Kerow at the weekend.
In the final, McMahon edged home 8-9, 9-8, 8-9, 9-8, 9-6 in a 54-end
marathon that lasted 5hr 10min.

CRICKET
WEST Indies completed a third Test victory over Australia by nine
wickets inside three days in Port Of Spain yesterday to level the series
at 1-1 with one to play.
Spearheaded by Curtly Ambrose, the West Indian fast bowlers engineered
an Australian collapse in the morning when the tourists lost five
wickets for two runs in 15 balls to tilt a low-scoring match decisively
in favour of the home side.
The tourists lost their last seven wickets for the addition of only 20
runs and were all out for 105 in just 36.1 overs, giving them a lead of
only 97. The resurgent Caribbean side then tossed salt into Australian
wounds by wrapping up victory in just 90 minutes for the loss of only
one wicket.
Brian Lara hit the winning runs after Richie Richardson (38 not out)
and Stuart Williams (42) had steered their side to the brink of victory.
Later, the captains said that the pitch was poor. ''The wicket was
underprepared,'' said Aussie Mark Taylor, ''but that didn't decide the
winner of the game.'' Scores:
Australia first innings 128 (S Waugh 63 not out; C Ambrose 5-45). West
Indies first innings 136 (G McGrath 6-47). Australia second innings 105
all out. W Indies second innings 98 for one.

WHITE and GOLD
ALTHOUGH Jack Banks' seven-year-old Mizyan, who goes in the Trent
Bridge Handicap today at Nottingham, will never become a household name,
he is the sort of horse many owners dream of.
He has won on the Flat and over hurdles, acts on turf and sand, and
will probably be sent over fences before long.
And Mizyan is clearly in good heart at present, judged on his latest
run on the Fibresand at Southwell two weeks ago.
Racing over a mile and three-quarters, Mizyan was sent for home three
furlongs out and held on well under a 10st steadier to beat La
Menorquina a length, the pair having drawn 20 lengths clear of their
rivals.
The gelding will run off a 3lb lower mark today and has obvious claims
over his optimum trip and with the ground likely to be in his favour.
Recent course and distance winner Swordking is a big danger and Reg
Akehurst's Special Risk may attract support, though the latter is
nowhere near as well handicapped as he was at the start of last season.
With John Dunlop's horses in fine fine, Khamaseen looks the safest
choice in the #8000-added 'Michelozzo' Conditions Stakes.
The four-year-old finished in excellent fifth in last year's Derby but
did not progress as one might have expected.
Reappearing over a mile-and-a-half in the Doncaster Shield last month,
Khamaseen attempted to make all but was tapped for foot in the closing
stages and could only finish six lengths third to Fire Worshipper.
He will appreciate the stiffer test of stamina and with the advantage
of a run under his belt can make the most of the weight he receives from
Castle Courageous and Poltarf.
Busy Banana can follow up last week's course victory by taking the
Headingly Limited Stakes.
Reportedly not right in himself as a juvenile, Busy Banana is quickly
making up for lost time and saw off 18 rivals in a mile handicap here by
five lengths despite being eased down.
He had earlier won over a mile-and-a-quarter so the step back up in
trip will present no problems.

IT was left to an Englishman based in Lockerbie to produce the only
Scottish-trained winner on the final day of the Grand National meeting
at Ayr.
Master of Troy, trained by Colin Parker and ridden by his son, David,
confounded the punters when he romped home to win the final of the
#16,000 Harcros ''Helping You Build'' Hurdle series.
Although he had won twice last season, at Kelso and Ayr, Master of
Troy had failed to find his form in nine races this term. In an earlier
Harcros qualifier he fell at the first and finished a one-paced fourth
in his last two races.
Parker decided to fit a visor and it worked a treat.
Coming out of the back straight Parker Jr appeared to be working hard
to keep his mount up with the pace, but turning for home he found his
second wind.
At the third last he took the lead and sprinted away from the field to
easily beat Bellton. Josh Gifford's No Pain No Gain, the 6-4 favourite,
was outpaced in sixth place.
For David Parker it was his thirteenth winner of the season and
thirtieth of his career. He is leading amateur at present, three ahead
of Mark Rimmer, and as a result of Saturday's success, he loses his 5lb
allowance.
The sponsors, Harcros, gave their guests a #5 charity bet on the Tote.
Twelve of them backed Master of Troy, and at 33-1 Scottish children's
charities benefited by more than #2000.
Home Counties victory in the sponsored Scottish Champion Hurdle was
another family affair. Trained by Dudley Moffatt and ridden by his son,
Jimmy, the Cheltenham County Hurdle winner cruised into the lead at the
last to beat Simple Arithmetic by six lengths.
Found to be lame on Wednesday he was nursed back to fitness by the
trainer's wife, Jenny, who rides him out every day.
It was a dismal day for favourite followers, with all eight going
down.
Leading Scottish trainer Len Lungo was out of luck. Livio, 3-1
favourite in the Barlett &amp; Sons Novices Hurdle, fell three out when well
beaten.
His jockey, Fraser Perratt, had to go to hospital for a precautionary
examination on his back. In the ''bumper'' Lungo's Castlebay Bob broke
down badly and had to be destroyed.
In the previous race, Nigel Twiston-Davies' Henry Vill fell and was
put down. The meeting attracted an attendance of 14,500.

LIKE all jump jockeys, Warren Marston is held together by a wiry
pragmatism, a win-some-lose-some philosophy which acts as a protective
barrier against the ups and painful downs of one of the most demanding
occupations in sport, but even he must be wondering if the great clerk
of the course in the sky has lost money on him.
Marston is stable jockey for one of the country's most prolific
winning trainers, Jenny Pitman, but as the great lady comes close to the
end of one of her many rewarding seasons, the No.1 jock has missed out
on the stable's spring double that made history.
He chose not to ride Royal Athlete, winner of the Martell Grand
National at Aintree, preferring to partner Garrison Savannah, who
finished ninth. At Ayr on Saturday, the stable did it again when
Willsford won the Stakis Casinos Scottish Grand National, and so did
Marston, but this time he was ''advised'' by his gaffer to partner Do Be
Brief, who ended up tenth.
No-one deserves a double whammy of that magnitude but Marston, who
joined in the celebrations along with the winning jockey at Aintree,
Jason Titley, will have nothing but good wishes for young Rodney
Farrant, who rode Willsford.
Farrant had his disappointment at Liverpool when the most fancied of
Pitman's six runners, Lusty Light, fell at the first.
Maybe Marston will get his turn when the wheel goes the full circle in
due course. Meanwhile, the first lady of steeplechasing was able in her
moment of triumph to admit she felt sorry for the young rider.
''I am gutted for him,'' she said. ''It was my decision to let Rodney
ride Willsford but it was Warren who got the horse going again this
season. He has done a brilliant job on him.''
The Ayr winner, known as ''Willie'' in the yard, thus joins Royal
Athlete, known as ''Alfie,'' in making up a unique double. Pitman is the
first woman to have won the two Nationals, the first woman to have won
the Aintree race, the first woman to have won the Ayr race, and the
first trainer for 21 years to have brought off the double.
It was quite a day for the Pitmans, including her former husband,
Richard, who reported the glorious happenings for his paper. Jenny,
whose smile might well have been still in place from a fortnight
earlier, had swithered for four days about running Royal Athlete but
finally decided to go ahead at about 3pm.
There were a bunch of backers who were to regret her decision, but the
horse ran well for a long time, eventually running out of fuel when he
was pulled up at the fourth from home.
It was further proof that only an extraordinary horse will be able to
emulate the one extraordinary horse to have achieved that distinction,
Red Rum, who did the deed in 1974.
Mrs Pitman, who now has won two Aintree nationals, three Welsh
versions, and the Midlands National twice (''I must go for the Irish
next''), thinks Willsford is a bit extraordinary himself. ''When you put
a camera in front of him he talks,'' she said, leaving some of us
wishing we had visited him in the morning. ''He is a real character.''
She is one of life's characters herself but even she winced mildly
when one of the horse's owners, Arnie Kaplan, invited everyone who felt
that way inclined to come to the party at the Turnberry Hotel.
No reports have reached us yet of how the knees-up went but if the wee
man in the bunnet, clutching a frothy pint (''Where is this Turnberry
place?''), made it, there should have been some unusual fun.
Even if finding the 16-1 winner was beyond most of us, the National
was a marvellous spectacle and a tremendous race in the end betwen two
brave and willing runners, Willsford and Sweet Duke, who ran a wonderful
race for a relative novice.
However, when it came to the last push for the line, it was the
old-timer, the 12-year-old, Willsford, who had the extra determination
to get there first. Lo Stregone was third, with Musthaveaswig, who made
one crucial mistake near the end, fourth.
It was the Pitmans' day, however, and anyone seeking the secret of her
success might want to take the carrot route to victory. She had asked
the owners to buy some carrots for her horses on Friday night. ''We
bought 14lb worth,'' said Kaplin. ''It seemed to do the trick.'' And we
study form.
At least we won't feel as embarrassed as the Uttoxeter steward who
told Jenny last season that she should consider retiring Willsford after
he came in marked by the whip.
''The horse marks easily,'' she said, ''and I told the steward to mind
his own business. I'll do my job, he should do his.''
Not a lady to be trifled with, is Jenny, but she is unquestionably a
National star.

THE Rugby World Cup, savoured and anticipated for so long, is now
almost with us. On Saturday, the Scottish squad departs for two altitude
acclimatization games in Madrid -- against the Spanish Barbarians and
the Spanish national side -- and then all roads lead to Pretoria in
South Africa.
Scotland play pool games against Ivory Coast on May 26 and Tonga four
days later. But the crunch game for the Scottish side is that against
France in the Test arena of the Loftus Versfeld stadium, Pretoria, on
June 3. A defeat against the French would mean a likely meeting with the
All Blacks, so a win over France would be welcome to say the least.
One man perfectly placed to adjudicate on the current respective
merits of Scotland and France is Romanian captain Tiberiu Brinza. Within
the space of 14 days, the accomplished No.8 forward has led his side
against the Scots and the French.
Sixteen days ago in Bucharest, the French struggled to record a 24-15
victory over Romania. At Murrayfield on Saturday, the Scots were much
more impressive as they demolished Romania 49-16.
Brinza is adamant that Scotland are the better side. He declared:
''The French play in a different style but we had much more trouble
today against Scotland than we did against France.
''Some of the spontaneous play of the Scots today caused us real
problems. The play of the Scottish threequarters, in particular, caused
us a lot of trouble.''
Would then, he was asked, Scotland defeat France in Pretoria? Brinza,
even allowing for the fact that his side had just been taken apart by
Scotland and that good manners might have precluded any other answer,
unhesitatingly replied: ''Oh yes.''
For Scotland on Saturday, one of the most encouraging aspects of the
game plan was the manner in which the side strung together passages of
telling continuity rugby with the ball in hand. With the hard ground of
South Africa beckoning, team manager Duncan Paterson had observed in
advance of the game that it was the intention to play fluent rugby, and
so it proved.
Afterwards, the Scottish captain Gavin Hastings declared that this
would be the style which they would take with them to South Africa.
There was some discussion, too, at the after-match press conference as
to the decision to bring brother Scott on for Hastings as the skipper
went lame after a collision with Craig Joiner in the seventy-ninth
minute of the match.
On the replacements' bench, Cameron Glasgow was itching to get on for
his first cap but, instead, the role of filling the captain's boots went
to Scott. There was, perhaps, an argument to be made for getting
Glasgow's debut cap in the bag -- albeit a 60-second one -- before the
departure for South Africa but, said Paterson, the plan had always been
that if misfortune befell the captain, then Hastings Jr should step in.
Whether this indicates that the powers-that-be view Scott as the
likely successor to Gavin in the full back berth once the captain has
hung up his boots next season remains, for the moment, a matter only of
interesting conjecture. More interested than most will be Kenny Logan
and Edinburgh Academicals' Rowen Shepherd.
* BUSINESSMAN John Connor, who is the instigator of a novel plan to
bankroll a Scottish club along the lines of wealthy clubs in England for
the start of next season's revamped league competition, has denied
weekend reports that Watsonians are to be the recipients of his
largesse.
Connor, who runs the Stirling Fibres wastepaper recycling operation,
said yesterday that he had held talks with Boroughmuir and with
Watsonians' captain Gavin Hastings but nothing had yet been decided. He
hoped to make an announcement within the next three weeks. ''I am
furious about this report because it is not true. I have not even spoken
to the Watsonians' committee.''
He said that an initial sum of around #100,000 would be on offer to
kick-start his ambitious plans but more cash would be made available as
the exercise progressed.
* THE Scottish Rugby Union is involved in talks with a number of
Scottish companies over sponsorship of the domestic rugby scene next
season. Chief executive Bill Hogg said yesterday that the contract with
Scottish Brewers, who have been involved, with their McEwan's brand, for
nine years, was due to end this season and that discussions were
continuing with them and other interested parties.
Rival brewers Tennents, who currently back the Jed-Forest sevens and
the Midlands Cup, are viewed as possible contenders for a more
wide-ranging sponsorship package next season, but yesterday marketing
director Mark Hunter would say only: ''At the moment we are involved
with Jed and the Midlands Cup. We would not comment on speculation that
we might be going to expand our involvement. Any such talks have to
remain confidential.''
County kings
STIRLING County, Scottish rugby's senior and youth champions as well
as leaders in the Borders Kings of the Sevens league, retained their own
sevens trophy at Bridgehaugh by beating Currie 19-15 with tries from
Matt McGrandles, Mark McKenzie and Bob Wylie, two converted, to two from
Neil Sneddon and one from Mark Blair, but no conversions. Results:
First round -- Stirling County 21, Grangemouth 10; Gala 28, Kirkcaldy
21; GHK 22, Selkirk 21; Dundee HS FP 24, Dollar Academicals 12; Kelso

Hampden has seats now and safety has been improved but there has been
no real heed paid to the Taylor report
EXCLUSIVE: By JAMES TRAYNOR, Chief Sports Writer
THE jewel in the SFA crown, the Hampden project, is facing serious
competition from a group of businessmen who are planning a new national
stadium complex in Lanarkshire and, like football's governing body, they
are submitting an application for funding to the Millennium Commission.
The consortium's proposal is for a 50,000 all-seater national stadium
and centre for sporting excellence which they believe will cost #120m
and are about to seek #50m from the commission, who will also receive a
submission from the SFA.
Two weeks ago, the association announced plans for a #67m further
upgrading of Hampden, stating they intend seeking half that amount from
the commission, but Brian Stewart, managing director of architectural
and engineering firm RMJM Scotland Limited, believes the plan with which
he is involved to be more worthy of millennium funding.
''I don't think the SFA proposal is a proper millennium project,'' he
said. ''First, Hampden exists, it is there and it has had money from the
Government and the Football Trust.
''Hampden has seats now and safety has been improved, but there has
been no real heed paid to the Taylor Report requirements. What about the
local community problem and the movement of people in and out of the
stadium?''
Stewart and the group with whom he has been working for several years,
insist a new stadium capable of accommodating various sports should be
constructed near Strathclyde Park and their plans include an arena with
a retractable roof.
They believe there is no reason why cities such as Toronto and Fukuoka
in Japan should be the only places to boast skydome-type stadiums and
argue that Scotland has a chance to leap to the front with their design
which has caught the interest of the Royal Fine Art Commission for
Scotland.
The commission have written saying the design for Strathclyde
''exhibits special quality which we think should be illustrated in the
Commission's report for the period 1992-94.''
Stewart realises SFA backing would have strengthened the pedigree of
his project, but Scottish football's governing body are committed to
Hampden. The chief executive, Jim Farry, has long seen the restructuring
of Queen's Park's ground as the only game in town, even though he is
aware of the work being done by Stewart and his colleagues.
''We are in a vicious circle in this country in that if the sports
people and the SFA say something is not possible everyone else thinks we
have no right to set our sights at that level of work,'' said Stewart.
''Instead we are to make do with two coats of paint or whatever, and
that's it.
''However, I'm convinced if we are given the right support the public
will rally to the idea of our kind of stadium and I have to say also
that we in Scotland should be at the cutting edge of technology in
sport. At the moment we are so apathetic. It is as though we are all
waiting for the catalyst.
''This stadium out by Strathclyde Park on the edge of a motorway
network could be what we have been waiting for. There is a new
generation of stadiums being built around the world and why shouldn't we
be up there keeping pace?''
Ernie Walker, only recently appointed to head up an independent review
body for Scottish football, also is au fait with the plan and it will be
interesting to see where he stands these days because he has been a
supporter of Stewart's type of stadium. Indeed, Walker, regarded by FIFA
as an expert on football stadiums, is an admirer of the American-style
facilites and the Strathclyde proposal comes closer to any of those than
Hampden.
Initially, retail and housing developments had been schemed for the
Strathclyde venture, but these became contentious requirements and have
been dropped. The idea now is to go only for the sports complex and
centre for excellence which ought to enhance the chances of Stratchlyde
Regional Council granting planning permission. In turn that would help
the millennium bid.
Stewart and his people do not hide dismay that the SFA turned away,
but they are determined to take their plans, which include medical
research facilities as well as the usual hospitality, conference, and
other attributes expected in modern arenas, as far as possible. An
approach to the Millennium Commission for backing can be seen as a final
assault to break stereotype notions of what stadiums should look like.
However, applications for funding must be in by the end of this month
and if their submission captures the admiration of the commission, they
will have an excellent opportunity of usurping plans for the new Hampden
which incorporate an upgrading of Lesser Hamdpen and the provision of an
indoor arena for the local community.

IT WAS Gavin's day, of course, but for the Scotland centres it was
also the afternoon they published their claims to be the first choices
for the World Cup midfield . . . and made a personal point or two.
Graham Shiel and Tony Stanger, three tries between them, had both been
longing for the opportunity.
They had been together in the Scottish side whipped by South Africa in
November, Stanger a reluctant winger, Shiel immediately dropped in the
aftermath. Tony announced, again, he would wing it no more, Graham sat
uncomplainingly on the replacements' bench.
Shiel, the man of the match in my opinion against Romania, admitted to
being frustrated. ''I think I have been playing as well as any time in
my career.
''All you can do in such circumstances is to wait. I worked hard on my
speed and just hoped for a recall.
''My try this time was a rehearsed move and Chick Chalmers must take a
lot of the credit. I had formed a centre partnership with Tony for the
South and I think we are quite a good blend. It was great to be able to
supply him with the pass for his second score.''
This is a big year for 24-year-old Shiel, a junior site manager with a
Border construction company. In July, just after his return from the
World Cup, he marries Mandy Morgan, the daughter of Scots' coach
Douglas.
Stanger has now scored 18 tries for his country, second in the
all-time list to Ian Smith (24). Apart from his winning touchdown in the
Grand Slam decider with England in 1990, none have given his such
satisfaction as the brace on Saturday.
He has had to work hard to convince the selectors he was able to
switch positions. ''It has come right at last and I have absolutely no
regrets,'' he insisted.
''The first try was simply a burst on to a crash ball but the second
must have looked like it was filmed in slow motion. When Graham gave me
the ball there seemed an awfully long way to go and I took a while to
get there.''
Stanger, who now has 37 caps, is still only 26 and could set a new
club record.
The current Scotland wingers were celebrating a try apiece. ''Once
Craig scored,'' declared the irrepressible Kenny Logan, ''there was no
way I was letting him get ahead of me.''
There was a suspicion that Kenny might have put a foot in touch en
route to the line but, surprisingly, he was having none of it.
''I don't know why the referee took so long to put his hand up to
signal the score. The touch judge eventually gave him the all clear.''
Craig Joiner is building a reputation as a lethal finisher. ''Yes, I
saw Gavin outside me and he did shout for the ball but there was
absolutely no chance he was going to receive it from me. The forwards
supplied us with some fine ball today.''
One of the aforementioned completed the home try-scoring. Bryan
Redpath harried his opposite number Neaga, allowing Eric Peters to go
over for his second international try.
''All down to the wee man,'' insisted the Bath No.8, who has
definitely been one of the discoveries of the season.
Among the impressed spectators was SFA chief executive Jim Farry. ''It
was heartening to see a Scotland team win in such style,'' he told me.
''Everyone in football wishes Gavin and the boys the very best for South
Africa.''

SCOTLAND in recent seasons has been indebted to the tenacity and
skills of their scrum halves, to which the memorable deeds of Roy
Laidlaw and Gary Armstrong bear rich testimony. Although he has not
attained the same eminence, it seems that another of much the same
calibre and potential has taken over the berth in Bryan Redpath, whose
display against Romania embodied many of those admirable qualities that
marked out his famous predecessors.
He has yet to achieve their try-scoring feats but there was shown
against the Romanians a sound grasp of all the basic essentials to the
scrum half role. Clearly, he has worked assiduously on his service but
it isn't only that he now has quick hands with sharp delivery off either
mitt. It is his judgment of range that is also so impressive, one moment
flicking up from the floor a one metre pop pass to Peter Wright, the
next performing a tap offence routine with Kevin McKenzie then adjusting
the length of delivery to suit to perfection the positioning of the
recipient.
Redpath left almost all the punting against Romania to his club
colleague, Craig Chalmers, who seldom has put boot to ball with greater
power or accuracy. Yet there was one typical angled punt from Redpath
that incorporated vision and feel and there was also reaction to a
ricochet and clearance kick in one swift movement that eased a panic
situation.
It spoke volumes for the little Melrose warrior that, having
contributed three times to the splendid sequence leading to the Gavin
Hastings try, including the provision of the scoring pass, he should
shrug off what had all the appearance of a head contact from the
Romanian hooker Valere Tufa. Certainly, as Redpath gave the scoring
pass, Tufa drove in hard and high to catch Redpath on the face with his
head. Whether there was intent or not, in no time at all Redpath was
back in the action as competitive as ever.
His foot pull on opposite number Daniel Neaga was craftily timed to be
legal and lethal in leading to the Eric Peters try. Nor need there be
any doubt about his defence commitment. Big South Africans and Italians
were torpedoed in those ''A'' team performances that re-enhanced his
rating and there was one priceless sinking on Saturday when Romeo
Gontineac threatened break-out as he screeched past three tackles only
to have his pins taken from him in typical Redpath fashion.
Redpath would be the first to acknowledge the aid to his performance
of having a pack that frequently created an advancing delivery platform.
That will be more difficult to attain in the tough tasks that lie ahead.
Yet he is not unacquainted with hard times. After all he played for the
South against the 1993 All Blacks.
He knows also that Derrick Patterson does not lack ambition to add to
the cap he gained against South Africa. It is, indeed, comforting for
Scotland that such a gifted understudy is being set such heady targets
by the chirpy little man in possession.

MICHAEL Jones, one of the world's best flankers, may be left out of
the New Zealand squad for the World Cup in South Africa because his
Christian beliefs prevent him from playing on Sundays and World Cup
quarter-final and semi-final matches are due to be played on the
sabbath.
New Zealand coach Laurie Mains omitted Jones from the final All Black
trial next weekend, saying the forward's stance on Sunday football was
the main reason.
''At this stage we think the playing strength in the loose forward
positions is such that we don't have to take a player who can't play on
Sundays,'' Mains said.
''My faith in God is the most important part of my life,'' he said.
Jones missed the 1991 World Cup semi-final against Australia -- a
match the All Blacks lost -- because the game was played on a Sunday.
New Zealand are also likely to be without No.8 Zinzan Brooke, who is
nursing an Achilles tendon injury.

OK, so Scotland fell asleep for bits of the game, well no wonder.
If you were in that team, doing your bit for Scotland, then you sure
would be in self-preservation mode as there would have been far more
important things on your mind. Like steering clear of injury before the
World Cup for example, or practising a few moves that had been dusted
down and pulled from the shelf.
I'm not going to get emotional or churlish about Gavin Hastings'
retirement, neither the timing of it, nor the method of announcing it.
He announced it in his column in a newspaper, and, like it or lump it,
that's what is going to happen more and more often in rugby.
Gavin Hastings gets paid to write a column, so he is hardly going to
call a press conference to announce something that should appear in his
column. The paper wouldn't like that.
Well done to him and his paper.
The timing certainly put a few on the gate, and God knows what the
crowd would have been had a screaming horde of youngsters not appeared
to cheer their hero on at the last minute.
Ten thousand? Where was everybody?
Where were all the cutely dressed women in their SRU tartan skirts
that usually flock to Murrayfield, chat to the people in the adjacent
seats, eat their picnics in that car park, and haven't a bloody clue
about rugby?
Where, indeed, were their husbands?
Perhaps some of the debenture-holders realise that they can't stand
the sight of their allotted neighbours for the next 20-odd years.
The Romanians may not have the world's biggest travelling support but
that's irrelevant.
We often talk about the, supposedly typical working man in the Borders
who can't get a ticket to go to the game.
This is because so many of those with cash or debenture seats get
ahead of him, and no wonder that even he would have decided not to come
because, after all, why should he, and his pals, have to fill up the
stadium for a lesser game just because the folk with easy access to
tickets don't fancy turning up.
I spoke with a friend at the game and he made the valid point that
regular rugby watchers should have an advantage when it comes to going
to Murrayfield.
The SRU already makes it easier for, say, rugby teachers to get
tickets.
Why can't we, once and for all, shoot all of the fair-weather rugby
watchers that don't turn up for these games, and confiscate their
tickets?
A voucher system for tickets might work. If you turn out on a club
Saturday then you get a credit towards a seat.
That game deserved a big crowd. It isn't every day you can see the
boys in blue.
Saturday certainly showed the disadvantage of the debenture system in
that if you have a longstanding ticket, but don't fancy going, then
nobody else goes.
Well done those that went there.
Those that went to the game will have seen one of the most bizarre and
heart rending episodes in the day when Gavin Hastings went off injured
near the end of the game.
Cameron Glasgow, who I thought was the reserve full back, was taking
his track suit off in the tunnel to get ready to run on to the pitch
with a few minutes left when the management intervened and Scott
Hastings went on instead.
What, then, was Cameron Glasgow doing on the bench? Was he covering
second injury? Was he covering for injuries in the second row or
something then?
Scotland were thumping the Romanians by that stage and a little
sentimentality would not have been out of place to give him a cap.
Were they not doing the same with Kevin McKenzie?
In a season that has seen the Scottish camp handle almost everything
with an astuteness that can only be admired, that was a shambles. There
was absolutely no point in giving Scott Hastings another cap for a few
minutes, and I understand that the members of the Scottish bench were
not at all happy with what happened. And no wonder.
Everyone knows that Scott Hastings is being talked of as a possibility
to succeed his brother at full back, but he was never going to get much
action in the time period that was left.
Apart from that, the team did well to win a tricky game, and despite
getting looser than Cynthia Payne's drawers for a while, they did the
job that was asked of them.
They got back on the winning trail before the start of the World Cup.
Deep down, though, the players themselves will know that they need to go
up a gear or two yet.

IT'S a film. It's a song -- originally by sixties popster Dave Berry
and later covered by Boy George -- and it's a perfect description for
Rugby League. It is, of course, The Crying Game.
For months now, Rugby League has been bleating away to the House of
Commons National Heritage Committee about how awful those Rugby Union
chaps are and how decent, upstanding Rugby League is . . . well, one is
not quite sure what calumnies are being perpetrated against Rugby
League, other than the fact that it is, by its own admission, a game
which in the 100 years of its existence has signally and spectacularly
failed to capture the imagination of potential audiences in the Northern
Hemisphere.
The National Heritage Committee, after a litany of abuse aimed at the
Union code spearheaded by the so-called Parliamentary Rugby League Group
(how quaint, how pathetic) and its chairman Ian McCartney, Wigan RL
supporter and MP for Makerfield, has decided that the Union game should
be starved of government funding unless it ends its ''discrimination''
against Rugby League and admits that its amateurs are, to all intents
and purposes, paid.
McCartney, son of the former Dunbartonshire, Clydebank and Milngavie
Labour MP, Hugh of that ilk, was quoted this week, with reference to the
Rugby Football Union, as saying: ''The RFU has been found guilty and
sentenced to capital punishment. This will hasten the professionalism of
Rugby Union and will shake the establishment to its roots.'' Pass the
sick-bag Alice.
Here is another quotation worthy of note. Rugby League chairman
Maurice Lindsay is the speaker: ''We have to be honest and say that, in
100 years, Rugby League hasn't made the progress that some of us hoped
it would make. We haven't had an international game the stature of other
sports and we haven't had the finance to go hand-in-hand with the
international expansion we desire.''
This is by way of Lindsay's explanation for the fact that Rugby League
has taken the Rupert Murdoch shilling and that it will tamely roll over
and participate in a BSkyB TV bankrolled 14-team summer super league.
The socialist Mr McCartney is, thus far, silent on the takeover of his
game by the arch-capitalist Murdoch.
This is all so tiresome and the facts of the matter are these. Rugby
Union, warts and all, is game which is on the up. The popularity which
it currently enjoys is beyond the wildest expectations of Rugby League.
The Union code will have a worldwide showcase at the World Cup in South
Africa next month and all that League can do is press its nose to the
glass and wonder where it all went wrong for them.
Since the two codes went their separate ways a century ago, Union has
prospered while League in the UK has failed to break out of its
Yorkshire-Lancashire laager. Outwith the Rugby League heartland, the
punters have voted with their feet. They don't like it and the customer
is always right.
One cannot escape the conclusion that what motivates League in its
House of Commons crusade against Union is envy. Of course there are
hypocrisies within the Union code. Probably players in England, Wales
and further afield are paid. But this is matter for the player, the
club, the Rugby Union authorities and, much more significantly, for the
taxman. I'm afraid that what is has to do with Rugby League and a House
of Commons committee just escapes me.
But that is The Crying Game for you. It's a perfectly balanced code
but only because its advocates have chips on both their shoulders.

Win is ideal send-off for South African adventure
Scotland 49, Romania 16
THE TEAMS
Scotland -- A G Hastings (Watsonians); C A Joiner (Melrose), A G
Stanger (Hawick), A G Shiel (Melrose), K M Logan (Stirling County); C M
Chalmers, B W Redpath (both Melrose); D I W Hilton (Bath), K D McKenzie
(Stirling County), P H Wright (Boroughmuir), G W Weir (Melrose), S J

Replacement -- C Draguceanu (Steaua Bucharest) for Gealapu (54m).
Referee -- N Lasaga (France).
IF this was Hollywood then the man who prepares the scripts for Gavin
Hastings would be the hottest property in Tinseltown.
The Scottish captain, winning his fifty-seventh cap on his farewell
appearance at Murrayfield, ran out on to the turf which he has graced
since 1986 accompanied only by team mascot Neil Robertson from Montrose.
His team-mates had paused in the tunnel to allow Hastings his moment in
the limelight.
Just one minute and 45 seconds into the game, the captain opened the
scoring with a try. Somehow, you just knew that he would. He went on to
record a personal tally of 19 points, boosting his Scottish total to
563, and then, in the final minute, caused the 30,000-strong crowd to
gasp a collective intake of breath when he went down injured.
He lay on the ground for a moment or two before limping off with a
bruised left leg. As he left the pitch for the last time, the entire
crowd rose to its feet and awarded Hastings a standing ovation. As a
Murrayfield exit line it couldn't have been scripted better.
With thoughts of South Africa and the World Cup in mind, Hastings has
been downplaying his departure from the domestic stage. ''I told the
rest of the team not to bring the Kleenex, but you knew it was never
going to be an emotional occasion because this is not my last match,''
he said later.
Nor would he want his personal involvement to overshadow what was a
particularly pleasing seven-try performance by the Scottish side. In
many respects this was a no-win game for Scotland.
Romania did not play particularly well but, then again, Scotland did
not let them. They played better when losing 24-15 to France in
Bucharest a fortnight ago but Scotland, who played much better than the
French had done, were always likely to be too strong.
On Saturday, the acid test was always going to be the manner of
victory and in this respect the Scots came through with flying colours.
The centre partnership of Graham Shiel and Tony Stanger -- tested at
District level but not in a Test match -- worked well although there was
some defensive confusion which led to the Romanian try by Nicolae
Racean.
Both Scottish centres, however, scored tries of their own. Stanger, in
fact, had two. The first came after 12 minutes, the big Hawick man
powering through on a free-kick crash ball and the second coming 10
minutes from the end, Hastings, Logan and Morrison setting Shiel off on
a stylish 60-metre dash with Stanger -- looking for all the world like
the winger he doesn't want to be -- finishing off to perfection.
Hastings, having struck the upright with the conversion attempt from his
own try, made no mistake this time and the Scots were looking set for a
convincing performance.
Shiel's try, a set-piece affair from scrummage ball with Craig
Chalmers decoying to the left, came on the half-hour mark and, with
Hastings converting, the Scots had a throughoughly deserved 19-6 lead.
Either side of the interval, though, Scotland allowed the Romanians to
claw their way back into the game. Fly-half Neculai Nichitean had kicked
two first half penalty goals and on the stroke of half-time he came
close with a 40-metre effort.
The Romaninan fight-back was, though, only momentarily delayed. In the
first minute of the second period, from a scrummage near the Scottish
line, Nichitean salvaged something from an appalling pass from scrum
half Neaga and Gontineac linked with Racean who punished poor Scottish
defence as he raced in for the try. Nichitean converted and a Romanian
revival was on the cards.
Four minutes later the resurgence came close to reality when Nichitean
kicked a penalty goal to make it 19-16. This was just a bit too close
for comfort.
The Scots, though, displayed commendable character by getting back
into the groove almost immediately, a Hastings penalty goal keeping the
scoreboard ticking over and a try by Eric Peters putting daylight
between the sides once again.
The try was a copybook poacher's effort by the Bath No.8. Bryan
Redpath harried opppsite number Neaga at the base of the scrum, the ball
went loose and Peters grabbed his chance, and the ball, with both hands
to sprint 20 metres for the touch down.
The Scots had regained control of the game and a Hastings penalty goal
was the precursor to a flurry of tries, Craig Joiner and Stanger scoring
within the space of three minutes. Hastings converted both and the Scots
were looking high, wide and handsome at 42-16.
Seven minutes from the end, and on his sixteenth appearance for
Scotland, Kenny Logan finally scored his first Murrayfield try.
Bridgehaugh's favourite son swept aside the flag as he touched down in
the left corner but, after a moment's consultation with his touch judge,
the French ref said the try was good.
In view of the grin on the Logan visage, which would have put the
Cheshire Cat to shame, Monsieur Lasaga surely wouldn't have had the
heart to say no. Hastings converted with just the hint of a bow to the
crowd and Scotland were just one point shy of the half century. It had
turned into a bit of a Romanian holiday but, with only two games in
Spain remaining next week before the Scottish party departs for the
World Cup, it represented a healthy tonic for the South African
adventure.

Anne Johnstone reports that local authorities are finally getting the
message that city cycling makes sense -- but resources are needed if the
bike is to make a comeback
JUST Get up and GlasGOw, exhorts the health board cycling poster. So
far few have taken up the challenge. So few that cycling barely features
in the city's transport statistics and campaigners claim fewer people
travel by pedal power than in any comparable European city. Cycling
accounts for less than 1% of all commuter trips.
Last month the Scottish Chambers of Commerce managed to hold a major
transport conference, Getting Scotland Moving, without a single item on
the agenda about cycling or any other green mode of transport. Five
years ago this would not have raised a single eyebrow, but this time the
oversight provoked an angry demonstration from an articulate group of
bike campaigners, dressed in business suits to make their point.
It coincided with the publication of an upbeat City Centre Millennium
Plan from Strathclyde region's roads department. In the not too distant
past this department was run by officials and politicians whose
brightest dream was that one day every household in Glasgow would own a
car. No longer. Now the car is seen as the villain of the piece, while
barely a page in the new plan doesn't mention bicycles and the need to
encourage them.
Though short on figures and targets, it promises a package of the very
measures cyclists have been demanding for years: 12 km of cycling
commuter routes; traffic calming, including 20mph zones; provision of
secure parking for cycles and special arrangements for bikes at
junctions.
Charlie Gordon, chair of Strathclyde's road and transportation
committee and front-runner for the same job in Glasgow's new unitary
authority, has said he wants at least 3% of the workforce commuting by
bike by the end of the century. This may sound like small beer by
comparison with European cities where almost a third of workers bike in
from the suburbs, but in Glasgow it represents a significant change in
official thinking.
It may take more than the relatively modest planned investment -- #2m
including #800,000 in the current year -- to reverse the vicious circle
which has been driving bikes off the roads for 40 years. In the 1950s
almost 15 billion miles of travel a year in Britain was by cycle,
compared with 36 billion by car. By the early 1990s bike travel had
shrunk to three billion miles while car trips had swollen to 365
billion.
Although we hear much about the creation of cycle tracks these days,
most have been aimed at the growing legions of recreational cyclists as
opposed to the two-wheeled commuter. Glasgow, for example, doesn't have
one single continuous commuter route to bring cyclists into the city
centre. Ian Spinney, secretary of the Glasgow Cycling Campaign, says
this lack of infrastructure is the main reason for the low numbers of
cyclists.
In turn, low usage appears to be the main reason for the relatively
high number of cycle accidents. Motorists simply don't ''think bike''.
In European countries where cycling is up to 10 times as common as in
Britain, it is also 10 times safer. A survey in Glasgow last year showed
that fear of accidents was the greatest deterrent to cycling, followed
by exhaust fumes.
Whatever the reason, the small number of cyclists in the city has been
used as justification for lack of investment in facilities for them,
ensuring that the vicious circle will continue.
There is a paradox here, summarised neatly at a recent conference by
John Grimshaw, maverick director of Sustrans, the charity which is
aiming to build a 5000-mile national cycle network: ''Although the
bicycle is perhaps the ideal vehicle for today's small, crowded and
polluted planet, it is dangerous and unpleasant to cycle on today's
heavily trafficked roads.''
The other paradox, of course, is that record numbers of bicycles are
being sold but hardly used beyond the occasional weekend foray into the
countryside, carried on the back of a car. Last year more people in the
UK bought bikes than cars but the number using them as a mode of
transport has probably never been lower.
There is nothing inevitable about these trends. Dr Harry Burns,
director of public health for Greater Glasgow Health Board, recently
described the city as ''highly dangerous and unattractive'' for cyclists
and called for a major investment in cycle lanes, commuter paths, cycle
parking and the like. The health board has not only taken a lead in
paying staff a mileage allowance to cycle to work but is also busy
investing in cycle parking and showers to encourage them to do it.
Glasgow Cycling Campaign, eager to present a special award to a city
company which has taken similar measures, failed to come up with a
single candidate.
If local government supplies the infrastructure and employers become
''bike-friendly'' the effects could be dramatic. Other cities in
Northern Europe, just as rainy and windy as Glasgow have shown this. In
the Netherlands, where all major towns and cities have dense networks of
dedicated cycleways, 29% of all journeys are by bike. In Denmark it's
20% and in Germany 11%.
European countries have achieved these statistics simply by taking
cycling seriously. In Groningen, in the Netherlands, restricting car
traffic in the city centre and making cycling an important part of the
town's public relations strategy have resulted in half the population
travelling by bike. In Freiburg, in Germany, a combination of cyclepaths
and new trams have swept the city centre almost free of traffic in
little more than a decade.
The few British cities which have tried to cater for cyclists, despite
a lack of encouragement from a car-fixated Government, have seen
dramatic changes in commuting habits. In 1988 York adopted a cycling
strategy, including 60 km of cycle routes, because its ancient city
centre had become choked with traffic. Today about 20% of trips in the
city centre are by bicycle. John Rigby, of York City Council, says:
''Measures to benefit cyclists require a change in the allocation of
resources, a commitment to depriving motorists of some road space, and a
willingness to experiment with novel solutions.''
The first sign of a change in Government thinking came last summer
with a statement on cycling, endorsing its health, economic and
environmental benefits and suggesting local targets. For the first time
it was admitted that there was a suppressed demand for cycling and a
realisation that we have to change the street environment to make
cycling an attractive choice. Government funding would be available for
such schemes. In the autumn the new message was rammed home further with
the transport report from the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution, calling for a quadrupling of urban cycling in the next 10
years and more thereafter.
In Scotland, roads and transport come under the Scottish Office
Industry Department. Trust Pedal Power, a report for the Cycling Public
Affairs Group last year, says that while the Scottish Office has always
paid lip service to cycling, it has been considered under the heading of
road safety. ''This concentrates on the negative aspects (accidents) and
ignores the important benefits (health, fitness, access, environment).''
However, Scottish regions have more freedom than their English
counterparts to promote their own schemes and three -- Central, Lothian
and Fife -- have given cycling big billing. Lobby groups appear to have
a major impact on how seriously councils view cycling. In Lothian, the
local authorities enjoy a good relationship with the local lobby group,
Spokes. Edinburgh is bidding for #5m of millennium funding for a radial
network of routes for bikes and pedestrians.
In Strathclyde until recently officials have tended to dismiss
cyclists as self-interested fanatics. Relations weren't helped by the
fact that one or two of the most vocal campaigners were also involved in
the M77 protest. Campaigners have dismissed officials as ''tarmac
engineers'' who didn't understand cyclists' needs or the value of
cycling in the fight against congestion and pollution. Now relations are
much better. The campaigners are professional and well-informed.
Officials are more prepared to consider alternatives to a relentless
programme of roadbuilding.
Though it falls short of the city centre, the region has completed its
first cycling commuter route, from Cumbernauld. Next month as part of
the Fit for Life campaign, a new spur will be opened joining the Glasgow
Loch Lomond cycle route along the Clyde with Argyle St near the
Transport Museum. Next year will see the opening of the route all the
way from Loch Lomond to Edinburgh. A number of bike racks have appeared
in Sauciehall St. There are plans to upgrade the Forth and Clyde Canal
towpath and talk about a cycle route through the Kelvin Walkway. ''We're
running very fast to catch up. It's a major priority. All local plans
contain proposals for cycling,'' says Earl Wilkie, cycling officer for
Strathclyde.
Ian Spinney of the Glasgow Cycling Campaign welcomes this sort of
rhetoric but says he'd like to see more action. Most of what has been
achieved and much of what's planned are routes aimed at recreational
cyclists. The Glasgow-Cumbernauld route is little used because it is
poorly designed, according to Spinney. Cyclists have to dismount a
number of times to cross major roads and the route meanders around side
streets. ''If someone is going to use a cycle route to get to work, it
has to be fast,'' says Spinney.
Spinney describes the 12km of planned cycle routes as ''a miserable
step in the right direction''. And although an eye-catching poster shows
cycle routes radiating spoke-like from the city centre, few have
progressed beyond the drawing board and even those don't actually meet
in the city centre. To achieve a truly integrated network, Glasgow would
have to adopt the practice of some European cities and allow cyclists
into pedestrian areas or resurface the network of backlanes. Most
depressing of all, there are fears that even the limited cycling
strategy on offer could fall victim to local government reorganisation.

SCOTLAND face up to their European Championship confrontation with San
Marino on Wednesday night confident of victory over the small republic
which nestles in the shelter of Italy.
But in the style stakes things may not be so clear cut.
Few would dispute the vision and unrivalled skill of Jimmy Johnstone.
But see him as a pin-up? Unlikely.
Jim Leighton was outstanding in the Scottish Cup semi-final against
Celtic and was chosen as man of the match. But a hunk? Probably not.
Let's face it, there aren't too many players with film-star looks in
Scottish football. In fact, there are almost none.
But switch on to Serie A from Italy on a Sunday afternoon and the
screen is swamped with Latin heroes who a) can string three passes
together; b) can speak in sentences often with words of more than one
syllable; and c) have generally got looks to swoon over.
All three are rarely found in Britain, certainly not together.
Moldini, Mancini, and Baggio. Even the names sound more inspiring than
Smith, Brown, and Dodds.
These pampered, bronzed Italian stallions line up for a match with
their flowing locks, turned up collars, and oozing sophistication. Some
of our players have the flowing locks . . .
Mind you, the Scots are up against it. Our climate hardly encourages
glowing tans. More likely it brings out an occasional freckle and
doesn't do much for the Albino legs.
The downside of Italian football in the behaviour and looks
departments unfortunately tends to be with the expatriate English.
Nobody, except his mother, could possibly find David Platt attractive,
despite the designer suits, and even Gazza's mother would be unlikely to
find her cry-baby son appealing. Certainly, his long-suffering
girlfriend, Sheryl, shouldn't after his last performance in a plush
restaurant in London. Tears and the usual wails of regret followed a
fracas which astonished other bemused diners.
But some have returned to this country with that je ne sais quois
which eludes their compatriots. Ray Wilkins is not as butch as his
nickname would suggest. Somewhere along the line he also picked up that
indefinable Italian veneer of style. After a successful playing career,
he now commentates with intelligence and foresight and manages to fit in
managing Queen's Par Rangers.
Mark Hateley has the trademark flowing locks which show he spent a
spell in Italy. However, for some, long hair is not as attractive as it
is for others. And where does he get those jackets? Some of the Scots
who journeyed to Italy for fortune and fame have not made such a
succesful transfer back to the home game.
Graeme Souness returned from foreign parts with a permanent suntan and
a taste for the good life. Joe Jordan came back down to earth when he
returned but both brought something that they hadn't left with. Their
accents. Maybe they should have taken elocution lessons from Gordon
McQueen.
During their sojourn in Italy, Jordan and Souness appear to have
developed some kind of speech defect which required them to end
sentences on a high. It's a shame that their careers didn't do the same.
Somehow, the English appear to make the transition back better than
the Scots. Gary Lineker, the Boys' Own hero, often thought of as Mr
Bland, seems to have made all the right moves, and has now forged a
career in television and radio as well as fitting in a writing sideline.
His only misdemeanour appears to have been a TV advert for crisps which
didn't go down well.
The fans can be scathing about their national football heroes.
''You're so ugly you don't deserve any appearance money,'' one
disgruntled supporter screamed at a Scottish striker.
Scathingly, another shouted to a vertically challenged winger: ''Does
your mammy know you're out. You should be playing in a Subbuteo team.
And where do you buy your clothes anyway? Your best hope's Mothercare.''
And the ultimate: ''Put a mask on. You're frightening the weans,'' has
been heard on more than one occasion in grounds around the country.
Of course, there are some Scottish players who have been likened to
stars of the silver screen. Freddy Kruger, Forrest Gump, and Elephant
Man come to mind.
But, ultimately, as footballers say, it's results that matter and if
Scotland return triumphant on the path to Europe after Wednesday's match
it will hardly matter whether they did so with style and grace as long
as they did it convincingly.
After all, San Marino hold the record for the quickest international
goal and that in 11 seconds against that other style-bereft team . . .
England.

Don't call me a saint, insists the man who helps waifs
A SIGN bearing the warning: Boxing Can Damage Your Health is displayed
prominently on the wall closest to the ring in the St Thomas' Boys and
Girls Club in Sheffield's Wincobank area. It isn't the most salubrious
part of town but it is the best that most of those who live there will
ever experience.
Every city has its share of areas out of which people aspire to leave
and some make through education and subsequently employment
opportunities, while others escape driven by a basic instinct to see
beyond the horizon. There are a few, however, who are given an exit visa
because they passed through the St Thomas' club.
It is in here an Irishman, Brendan Ingle, holds day and evening
classes. He is a boxing trainer and manager, but to leave it at that
would be to demean the 45-year-old who teaches something more
significant than the noble art. Ingle's classes are about life and all
manner of waifs and strays have been arriving at his gym seeking help.
They come with a willingness to box, to be like Prince Naseem Hamed,
who is trained and managed by Ingle, but the World Boxing Council
International super-bantamweight champion -- he will be a full-blown
world champion this year -- represents the glamorous side of the
business which perhaps all of the gym's other fighters will never
experience. They come because the outside seems a much more dangerous
and inhospitable place. They are fighters, but the game is bent. Life is
against them.
They may come to Ingle's door because they have been expelled from
school and have nowhere else to go, like the skinny little 14-year-old
kid -- names are not necessary, because in a sense they are all victims
-- who was thrown out of of school because he was bullying the other
children.
Then there is a lugubrious, muscular man in his middle 20s. He lumbers
around the ring seemingly without purpose and appears backward and
withdrawn, even though he has a physique which should frighten the life
out of people who don't like the feeling of pain.
He has had eight professional fights and has lost eight. ''Never won a
fight, maybe never will,'' he says, ''but I got laid off and I do it for
the money. Also, I like coming here. The atmosphere in here is good.''
Two Irish boys, who have been having trouble coping back home, have
been sent over to Ingle's place and in a week they have opened up. One
is a slow learner who was not given proper support at his school until
he saw no point in being shouted down by teachers who ought to have
known better.
In a week with Ingle, both boys are discovering the art of
communication. When they go back, as they must, they will carry with
them more self-respect and belief than they have ever known. Their
chances of a life have been improved slightly.
''Come into my office,'' Ingle says, extending a hand, and he walks to
the edge of the ring and perches down on the top step of a set of old
wooden stairs squeezed into the space between a wall and the ring.
''This is my office. This is where I do my work.''
An hour passes and he has spoken only to the boxers and would-be
fighters who arrive in ones and twos. They are all ages, two girls who
could barely have been 10 are jabbing in front of a mirror at the far
end of the gym while in the ring are boys aged from under 10 to 55.
No-one takes liberties in Ingle's gym, which is much more than that.
It is a haven for troubled and confused souls of all ages and above the
door it should say St Thomas' Refuge. All are welcome and Ingle will
have time for each of them provided they do two things. If they listen
and learn he will work with them.
After the initial introduction, it was my turn. His technique when
being interviewed is as off-the-wall as his approach to boxing and
although he communicates only with his fighters for the first hour of
our meeting, I watch and I learn.
Four boys are in the ring and in turn they step forward from their
corners, call out their names and addresses, and perform a flip a la
Naseem. Later, when there are eight in the ring, each one walks to the
centre and performs, but this time they have to sing or recite a poem.
One tough-looking kid sings a few lines of I Can Sing a Rainbow while
others offer renditions of Simply the Best, Humpty Dumpty, and Jack and
Jill. One of the Irish boys sings his national anthem in Gaelic.
Remarkably no-one laughed at anyone else and Ingle tells them: ''Ten
out of 10 for all of you for making the effort. Remember, this ring is
your workplace. Get used to it because you work on your own in there.''
He also informs them: ''Basically, people are shy,'' before calling
out: ''What have you learned here?''
One boy shouts back: ''I've learned skills, communicating skills.''
The teenager adds: ''I've learned co-ordination.''
He calls out to others asking questions and hearing replies such as:
''No-one is responsible for me. I am responsible for myself,'' and ''I
need patience and determination.''
''Let me tell you, none of these boys will get hurt in here, although
at its worst and with bad management boxing can be a dirty, rotten,
prostitute and vindictive business,'' Ingle said. ''When there is
someone looking after you who knows the business from A to Z, then
there's no other business like it.
''But it's hard. When a fighter gets #400 for a fight, he gets up
early to train, when he gets #4000 he might get up a little later to
run, and when he gets #40,000 he won't get up at all. He starts taking
short cuts.
''One boy in here says he wants to become world champion, says he
doesn't care about the money, and you know what I told him? I told him
he was an idiot, that he should want to be paid for going in there.
''Prize-fighting is the only game in which you can get killed legally.
It's the hardest game in the world.''
Ingle tells his fighters he is entitled to 10% for training them and
25% for managing them but he intends taking only 25%. He then explains
that if one of them wins #400 he would be left with #300, of which #100
should go into a building society, another #100 into some kind of
pension plan, and #100 would be left to pay bills.
''I make sure they know they must put #100 in a building society and
tell them that amount is for the tax man,'' he said. ''I tell a lad the
tax man will always come for you. You can't beat him and that the tax
man is the only person who beat Al Capone.''
Money, of course, causes arguments and Ingle has lost fighters because
while they are always willing to give him his #100 from a #400 purse,
they are not so sure about giving him his share of a #40,000 cheque.
The story goes that Naseem also had his doubts, but came back to tell
Ingle there would be no problem, that he would receive his due amount.
The pair work as a team and when Naseem goes to work it is with a
flair and confidence missing from other fighters. Ingle's best fighters
possess these qualities, but all of his boys are given a degree of
self-respect no matter how far in the fight business they manage to
travel.
If nothing else the outside world won't be as intimidating a place
when they leave. ''The most important things any of us can give others
are our time and whatever degree of knowledge we have,'' Ingle said
later as we sat in his own place, across from the club.
''My passions are boxing, religion, and politics,'' he said while
waving a hand in the direction of his bookshelves. ''I have Behan in
here, there is Shakespeare, and everyone else. In here I read and over
there in the gym I teach life and social skills.
''It is one of my beliefs that if I am ignorant and you have knowledge
then it is your duty to help me. What is wrong with helping someone
else?
''I was one of a family of 15 and I experienced this when I first came
here looking for work with nothing other than the clothes I stood up in.
I was a young man and maybe I had a resentment of the English because of
the troubles in Ireland, and yet I couldn't believe the hospitality.''
Ingle stayed and worked and married Alma, although life was difficult
as they tried to bring up their five children. Like many working men
there were periods when there was no work to be had and around the time
of Bloody Sunday in '72 he felt his accent was preventing him from
working.
''So I've known despondency, I've experienced racism, people's
prejudices and hard times, and I know what the boys who come into this
gym may be going through,'' he said. ''I talk to them, I get them to
think, to try to understand what is happening to them and why.''
Perhaps as many as 95% of the regulars to his gym won't box and it is
a matter of trying to get them to stand on their own feet. They come in
from depressing backgrounds, broken homes, they may have been abused,
neglected, and brow-beaten, and to some Ingle's club is the last stop
before a life of serious crime.
''I've always been a socialist, a Labour man, and I don't understand
why governments don't do more to help these people,'' he said. ''Surely
it is better to help them and get them in employment, and then we all
benefit.
''In here we communicate. No one brow-beats or brainwashes and when
they leave here these kids just might have a chance, because they will
be able to respect themselves and others a little more.
''Please, if you write anything, don't make me out to be some kind of
saint because I'm not. Far from it.''
I won't, but others might.

<HEADLINE>Homosexuals demand justice at Sachsenhausen memorial</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978731152</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
From MICHAEL SHIELDS, Sachsenhausen, Sunday
HOMOSEXUALS used their first chance to speak at ceremonies marking the
liberation of Nazi concentration camps to demand justice for thousands
persecuted solely for being gay.
Guenter Grau, a German historian, told services marking the 50th
anniversary of the freeing of the Sachsenhausen death camp today that it
was time to recognise the horror inflicted on homosexuals by the Nazis.
''Homosexuals were punished solely for being then what they are today:
men who love men and thus go against the norm,'' he said.
Grau told the biggest crowd assembled at the camp since 1961 that
German courts had willingly served a tyrannical regime and sentenced
about 50,000 men under anti-homosexuality laws toughened by the Nazis in
1935.
''Is this not reason enough to free homosexual men convicted during
the Nazi era of the shame of being sentenced as criminals? Are we not
morally obligated to rehabilitate them and give victims back their
dignity?'' he asked to applause.
''It is not solely the extent of the crimes against homosexuals that
makes them unprecedented. It is the inhumanity of the ideology that
raised them to official state thinking and thus directed them against
all homosexuals.''
About 2700 survivors, some in their old camp uniforms, attended the
events at the former Nazi camps in Sachsenhausen, built in 1936 just
north of Berlin, and at Ravensbrueck, which was the biggest
concentration camp for women.
Soviet and Polish soldiers reached them in the last days of the Second
World War to find only those too sick or injured to take part in forced
''death marches'' to the north.
Ravensbrueck, built 40 miles north of Berlin in 1938, housed about
132,000 women and children and 20,000 men. At first it held political
prisoners in ''protective custody'' but subsequently took Jews, gipsies,
criminals, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, and prisoners-of-war.
At Sachsenhausen, Grau said homosexuals had been stopped from speaking
at previous ceremonies at camps by officials who falsely believed ''the
honour of other prisoners would be besmirched if they were placed on the
same level as criminals''.
Reminding authorities how easy it remained to mobilise violence
against homosexuals, he called on political parties to commit themselves
to upholding human dignity, justice, and freedom.
More than 5000 homosexual men were sent to Nazi camps such as
Sachsenhausen. Some 3000 died.
Sachsenhausen was the death camp from which the SS administered its
campaign of murder and brutalisation. Nazi henchmen came here to learn
their murderous craft used so effectively in other camps.
It first held Communists, Social Democrats, union activists, Jews,
gypsies, pacifists, and criminals. Later most inmates were foreigners
from 47 countries in Nazi-occupied Europe.
About 100,000 people were gassed to death, starved, shot, hanged, or
subjected to grisly medical experiments. Others were marched to death
testing boots for German soldiers.
The lethal toll included more than 10,000 Soviet prisoners-of-war
killed in cold blood with shots to the head.
Polish novelist Andrzej Szczypiorski, a Sachsenhausen survivor, said
he had to force himself to return to the camp for the anniversary
events, overcoming his gut feeling never to walk through its infernal
gates again.
He asked what had happened at that time to the glorious Europe of arts
and music.
''I do not know. Perhaps God felt insulted and turned his mortified,
woeful face away from us,'' he said.
* German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel was heckled at the ceremony
when he referred to Sachsenhausen's subsequent use by communists.
Soviet secret police imprisoned around 50,000 political prisoners at
the camp after the war. Some 13,000 died.
Kinkel continued with his speech despite booing and calls of ''Get
out'' from the crowd of 8000, who apparently objected to his linking of
oppression from both fascists and communists.
''We remember the liberation on April 23, 1945. But Sachsenhausen was
not closed then. More prisoners came here. New suffering took place.
This we cannot forget,'' Kinkel said.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Sunday
PROSPECTS of renewing Bosnia's ceasefire, which expires in one week's
time, appeared increasingly bleak today after peace efforts by UN and
Western envoys ended in failure.
United Nations officials said they would press ahead with attempts to
persuade the warring parties to agree to extend the battered truce.
Privately, however, officials said that the Muslim-led Bosnian
Government and the Bosnian Serbs remained far apart, and both seemed to
be ready to try to settle their differences on the battlefield.
Fresh fighting was reported in northern Bosnia a day after UN special
envoy Yasushi Akashi left Sarajevo, having failed to make progress in
talks aimed at extending the four-month ceasefire which runs out on
April 30.
Akashi warned that current limited offensives could escalate into
all-out war unless it was renewed.
Diplomats from the United States and Germany, representing members of
the five-nation Contact Group on Bosnia, were barred from even entering
Sarajevo by besieging Bosnian Serb forces.
They departed with Akashi in a humiliating setback for the UN mission
and international peace efforts.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said the Contact Group --
Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and the United States -- was likely to
meet soon to discuss how to proceed after the weekend debacle.
Earlier, the UN commander in Sarajevo, General Herve Gobilliard,
attended a memorial service for three French soldiers killed in an
accidental explosion yesterday.
The three explosives specialists were killed while defusing old UN
ammunition at the airport.
Four others wounded in the accident were flown out on the same plane
as their dead comrades.
The deaths brought the number of French UN fatalities in Bosnia to 36
amid a period of uncertainty over continued French participation in the
Bosnian peacekeeping force.
Another French soldier was wounded in the feet today near Sarajevo
airport when he triggered an explosion.--Reuter.

Tokyo, Monday
ONE of the top leaders of a doomsday cult linked to the Tokyo poison
gas attack was stabbed to death by a right-wing extremist on the street
outside the sect's headquarters in the capital yesterday.
Police and dozens of reporters looked on as Hideo Murai, the head of
the science and technology unit of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Aum Supreme
Truth) sect and its second-highest ranking official, was stabbed three
times, twice in the stomach and once in the arm, with a kitchen carving
knife.
Murai underwent emergency surgery at a nearby hospital but died early
today.
Television showed today's attacker pushing through a crowd of
spectators and media people staked out in front of the cult HQ and
slashing at Murai, who was doubled over by the first thrust and then
stabbed twice more.
Murai, who has made daily television appearances to defend the sect,
staggered back inside, bleeding badly, and shortly afterwards was
carried on a stretcher from the building with an oxygen mask over his
face.
The attacker, who identified himself as an extreme rightist named Yuko
Jo, dropped the knife and surrendered to police who had the headquarters
under surveillance.
''He said he just wanted to hurt an AUM leader,'' said a police
spokesman.
He added that 29-year-old Jo was of Korean descent and a member of an
ultra-nationalist group in Mie, central Japan.
Japanese television reported that Jo told police was trying to punish
Murai because of trouble caused by the cult, which has denied any
involvement in the subway gas attack.
Police said the knifeman had waited outside the building for about
eight hours before making his attack.
The attack came as Japanese police said they now had enough evidence
to link key members of the sect to the March 20 subway gassing.
Kyodo news agency said police planned to arrest 20 more sect members
this week on charges of conspiracy to commit murder, including cult
leader Shoko Asahara.
Since the subway attack in which 12 people died and 5000 were injured,
police have carried out almost daily raids on sect facilities,
uncovering all the ingredients needed to make sarin, the nerve gas used.
Police believe Murai's unit made the liquid which was released into
the subway system from plastic bags.
Police have arrested more than 100 top sect followers, leaving Murai
in day-to-day charge of the cult since Asahara went into hiding the day
before the Tokyo attack.
Murai, a trained astrophysicist and graduate of Japan's prestigious
Osaka University, was regarded as one of the sect's most senior members
before he was elevated by the arrests.
Yesterday, the Mainichi newspaper quoted from a diary written by Murai
in 1991 in which he forecast that the cult would take over Japan by the
end of this century.
''Shoko Asahara will be imprisoned in the 1990s, but his trial will
prove the existence of supernatural powers and all 100 million Japanese
will become followers of AUM,'' Murai had written.
Today's stabbing was the latest chapter in a wave of violence that has
deeply shaken Japan, which has long taken the safety of its streets as a
matter of national pride.
Ten days after the subway killings, Japan's top police official, who
was responsible for the subway investigation, was gunned down and nearly
killed as he left home for work.
And, as Parliament passed a law banning the possession of sarin last
week, hundreds of people were sickened by toxic fumes released at a
train station in Yokohama, south of Tokyo.
Nearly two dozen other people needed hospital treatment after a
similar incident at a shopping centre near the same station on
Friday.--Reuter/AP.

Hong Kong, Sunday
THE Princess of Wales flew home from Hong Kong tonight at the end of a
successful fund-raising visit.
Her 50-hour working visit to the British colony helped raise more than
#100,000, or #2000 an hour, for cancer and leprosy charities, and the
Red Cross.
She boarded a scheduled flight to Heathrow after an informal farewell
dinner hosted by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten and his wife Lavender.
The princess combined work with pleasure by attending the men's final
of the Hong Kong Salem Tennis Open today, where she watched America's
Michael Chang beat Swede Jonas Bjorkman in straight sets, 6-3, 6-1.
Earlier, she flew to an Asian island where only men live and few women
are allowed.
Shek Kwu Chau Island, part of Hong Kong's New Territories, is
inhabited by a community of 300 hardened heroin addicts trying to kick
drugs.
The princess was the only woman on the island, except for one Hong
Kong policewoman in a VIP protection squad.
The princess mixed with the men, some of whom have led a life of crime
in the clutches of notorious Triad gangs. She shook hands with tattooed
addicts, chatted, and posed for photographs.
The princess was returning to the treatment and drug rehabilitation
centre she first visited in 1989 when touring Hong Kong with the Prince
of Wales.
She toured the island's facilities, escorted by medical superintendent
Dr Barrie Hollinrake, a Yorkshireman and former ship's doctor who found
his vocation working with addicts.

Rome, Sunday
FORMER Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi today renewed his call for a
snap General Election in Italy as exit polls showed his centre-right
Freedom Alliance taking 45% of the vote in regional elections.
The latest exit poll for Italian television forecast the Freedom
Alliance share of the vote in elections in 15 of Italy's 20 regions at
44.8%, with 36.9% for a centre-left grouping whose main force is the
ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). The rest would go to
smaller parties.
''This is a confirmation, if any were necessary, that there is a need
to go to the polls immediately,'' said media magnate Berlusconi.
''I think that this fact, this vote, must lead to immediate elections
to recover the democratic normality of the country.''
Berlusconi has called repeatedly for a General Election since he was
toppled last December after a mutiny by his Northern League coalition
partner.
He said that the Freedom Alliance planned to demand a meeting with
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro at which they would urge the head of
state to dissolve Parliament.
Italy has been governed since January by a stop-gap government of
technocrats led by former central banker Lamberto Dini, who was Treasury
Minister in the Berlusconi government.
Dini plans to present proposals on pension reforms in the next few
days, the last item on his four-point agenda.
Today's poll predicted victory for Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance in
seven of the regions and centre-left wins in six.
The poll said the outcome was too close to call in a further two
regions where voting had taken place for new regional assemblies and
presidents.
Counting in the elections, which were also for councils in 75
provinces and more than 5000 towns, will begin tomorrow.
With 90% of voters eligible to take part in today's polls, they were
the biggest test of political support since Berlusconi resigned as
premier. --Reuter.

Oklahoma City, Sunday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton called on Americans today to purge themselves
of ''the dark forces'' behind the devastating Oklahoma bomb attack.
More than 12,000 people packed Oklahoma City's Fairground for a
moving, tearful memorial service attended by Clinton, his wife Hillary
and evangelist Billy Graham.
The service was the culmination of a national day of mourning for the
81 known dead and 150 missing.
''One thing we owe those who have sacrificed is the duty to purge
ourselves of the dark forces which gave rise to this evil,'' said
Clinton.
He said these forces ''threaten our common peace, our freedom, our way
of life'', and added: ''Let us teach our children that the God of
comfort is also the God of righteousness.''
Clinton and nearly everyone in the audience wore multi-coloured
ribbons made up of white, yellow, purple, and blue strands. The white
stood for the dead, the yellow for the missing, the purple for children,
and the blue for the state of Oklahoma.
Scattered through the crowd were relatives of the dead and missing,
hugging teddy bears and holding single-stem flowers. Many also had
photographs of their loved ones.
Throughout Oklahoma today, people turned on porch lights and drove
with headlights on at all times as symbols of hope.
Church bells tolled and flags flew at half-mast across America.
''Today, our nation joins with you in grief. We mourn with you. We
share your hope against hope that some may still survive,'' Clinton said
at the memorial service.
''We pledge to do all we can to help you heal the injured, to rebuild
this city, and to bring to justice those who did this evil.''
In a televised interview from Oklahoma City, Clinton later called on
Congress to give the US Government broad new powers to prevent further
terrorist outrages, both foreign and domestic.
He sought funding for laws to enhance government ability to use
court-authorised electronic surveillance, and to set up a special FBI
counter-terrorist centre.
Billy Graham told the service of worship that the blast which tore the
face off the nine-storey Alfred Murrah building was ''a violent
explosion, ripping at the very heart of America''.
Clinton did not visit the explosion site, although his motorcade
travelled along a main road near the town centre where cranes at the
bombed-out building could be seen.
Aides said that the president did not want to disrupt the clean-up and
rescue missions, which resumed today after yesterday's bad weather made
operations unsafe.
Today rescuers hoped better weather would permit them to lift concrete
slabs covering the lower floors, where most of the bodies still to be
found remain.
In a ghoulish development, crews using sophisticated camera equipment
said they had found heatspots in the rubble, but believed that instead
of signs of life, the heat was generated by decomposing bodies.
Before they left Washington, Clinton and Hillary planted a young
dogwood tree on the White House grounds in memory of the dead.
The planting was suggested by six-year-old Allyson Mawn of Washington
after she took part in the president's televised address yesterday,
devoted to reassuring children traumatised by TV footage of the attack.
Allyson suggested planting ''trees to remember the kids that got
hurt''. The dead included at least 12 children at a day-care centre.
The Oklahoma City Philharmonic Orchestra played slow, elegiac anthems
at the memorial service. And, at one point, the entire audience stood
and sang Amazing Grace.
''The tragedy of April 19 shocked the world,'' Oklahoma Governor Frank
Keating said at the service. ''Never in the history of our country have
Americans witnessed such senseless barbarism.''
When the Clintons entered the arena they were greeted by loud cheers
which slowly grew as they reached their seats.--AP/Reuter.

Bruce Hoffman looks at the spread of American right-wing militias who
await the call to arms against imagined enemies
FORTY-EIGHT hours of frenzied speculation ended on Friday evening when
a 27-year-old US Army veteran, Timothy McVeigh, was charged with the
Oklahoma City bombing. McVeigh, an anti-government, right-wing
extremist, reportedly engineered the attack on the federal office
building to mark the second anniversary of the FBI's bloody assault on
Branch Davidian's Waco, Texas, compound.
Obsessed that the Waco raid represented the opening salvo in a US
Government conspiracy to outlaw possession of fire-arms and further
proscribe individual liberties, McVeigh and his alleged accomplices
appear to have acted from a combination of motives -- including
vengeance, protest and resistance. Even more disquieting, as lunatic as
such views and obsessive conspiracy theories sound, they are today held
by a growing number of like-minded Americans.
The Michigan Militia, the 12,000-strong paramilitary, survivalist
organisation that McVeigh has been linked to, believes that the US
Government has already initiated a programme to control completely the
lives of every American. Accordingly, through training in guerrilla
warfare and survivalist techniques, the militia prepares to resist what
it maintains are plans by the Clinton administration to deploy United
Nations forces, utilising cast-off Soviet military equipment, or hordes
of Communist Chinese troops, backed by Latino and black inner-city
American street gangs, to crush any opposition.
An estimated 100 other ''militias'' -- with upwards of 50,000 members
-- have reportedly sprung up in at least 20 other states, stretching
from Pennsylvania to California, and Montana to Texas. These groups, in
fact, are but the latest iterations of a radical right-wing cum
white-supremacist movement that has repeatedly re-invented itself over
the past decade in a bid to attract a more diverse constituency and
larger numbers of adherents.
Although organised hate groups, many embracing similarly far-fetched
conspiracy notions -- such as the Ku Klux Klan and John Birch Society --
have existed in America for decades, the advent of extremist,
white-supremacist paramilitary groups orientated towards
''survivalism'', outdoor skills, guerrilla training, and outright
sedition are a newer phenomenon.
The members of these groups are not full-time, ''professional''
terrorists -- like the more familiar Irish, Basque, Middle Eastern and
left-wing extremists active in Europe throughout the past two decades --
but consider themselves ''minutemen'': ordinary citizens and patriots
ready to take up arms at a moment's notice to defend their inalienable
rights. Self-styled heirs of the tradition of the American Revolution,
it is therefore significant that the Oklahoma City bombing also took
place on the date that the American Revolution began in Boston 220 years
ago.
The aims and motivations of these extremist groups, however, span a
broad spectrum of anti-federalist and seditious beliefs and religious
hatred, masked by a veneer of religious precepts. They are bound
together by their shared hostility to any form of government above the
county level; their vilification of Jews and non-whites as children of
Satan; their obsession with achieving the religious and racial
purification of the US; their belief in a conspiracy theory of powerful
Jewish interests controlling the government, banks and the media; and
their advocacy of the overthrow of the US Government, or the ZOG
(Zionist Occupation Government) as they disparagingly refer to it.
It is particularly alarming that the white supremacists' expressed
raison d'etre -- racism, anti-Semitism and sedition -- is justified and
legitimised on theological grounds. It is at once a political and
grassroots religious movement. The leaders of the movement -- like the
Michigan Militia founder and ''general'', Pastor Norman Olson, the
Idaho-based Aryan Nations' leader, Rev Richard Bulter and the Ku Klux
Klan's Pastor Thom Robb -- cloak themselves with clerical titles in
order to endow their organisations with a theological stance that
condones and justifies violence.
Perhaps most disturbing is that as the carnage and destruction of the
Oklahoma City bombing attests, movements do not appear to exhibit any of
the political, moral or practical considerations that constrain most
other terrorist groups from causing mass death and destruction. There
are, in fact, striking parallels between these groups and religiously
motivated Islamic Shi'a fanatics in the Middle East and even the Aum
Shrinikyo sect, the cult accused of a string of sarin nerve-gas attacks
in Japan.
Indeed, both the Tokyo incident and the Oklahoma City bombing
demonstrate clearly that, contrary to popular belief, terrorism
motivated by a religious imperative is not a phenomenon restricted to
Islamic groups exclusively from the Middle East, as many Americans and
other observers believed in the wake of the bombing. Rather it is a
characteristic of radical sects and religious movements everywhere --
and much as Americans may have resisted admitting it, in the United
States as well.
Dr Bruce Hoffman is chairman of the International Relations Department
and Director of the Centre for Study of Terrorism and Political Violence
at St Andrews University.

Stranraer 2, St Johnstone 6
GEORGE O'Boyle, the first division's leading scorer with 25 strikes to
his credit so far, was the main reason for the Perth side's emphatic
victory at Stair Park on Saturday.
The Northern Ireland internationalist found the back of the net three
times in a match which came fully to the boil only in the closing
stages. If truth be told, the St Johnstone striker could easily have
doubled his tally against the struggling Stranraer defence and, had he
not scored a late brace to make up the hat trick, O'Boyle would probably
have come in for not a little criticism for earlier misses.
Saints had to get by without the touchline exhortations of manager
Paul Sturrock, who was in Holland on a talent-spotting mission.
Undaunted, the Perth men took the initiative and O'Boyle fired a couple
of early warning shots across Stranraer's bow, or to be more precise,
one on either side of Duffy's goal.
It was left to defender Paul Cherry to put Saints ahead. He was first
to the ball in a crowded goalmouth in 11 minutes and headed home
following a Twaddle free kick.
There was a touch of controversy over Saints' second goal. Referee
Bobby Tait ruled that home defender Kenny Brannigan had touched the ball
back to his keeper and awarded an indirect free-kick to the visitors.
The chance was converted in simple fashion with Allan Preston
side-footing the ball to O'Neil, who hammered it home.
Alex McAnespie's team looked to be well on their way to a heavy defeat
when O'Boyle at last found his way to goal after 66 minutes. However,
Saints were stunned by a double whammy by Stranraer midfielder Darren
Henderson.
First, the midfielder blasted home from the edge of the six-yard box
and, a a minute later, his backward header beat Main after he jumped to
meet a McGuire cross.
Stranraer remained on top for a short spell and home hopes of an
equaliser were high. In particular, substitute Lex Grant showed some
inventive touches.
At last O'Boyle rediscovered his shooting boots and killed off
Stranraer's hopes. His second goal was an easy shot past the flailing
Duffy after Saints substitute Gary Farquhar had crossed from the left,
and, with two minutes left, O'Boyle completed his hat trick.
In between these goals Twaddle had been rewarded for his hard work
when his overhead kick had beaten Duffy for Saints' fifth.

Clydebank 1, Hamilton 4
SITTING comfortably suits Hamilton Academical. What can happen to them
to the end of the season is neither up nor down. They have it cushy.
Having made for themselves a soft place in the middle, they have turned
the division table into a sofa. Uppermost in their minds might be
holidays.
So how come they were going about cuffing Clydebank, whose minds ought
to be at their most concentrated?
In the corridors afterwards Kilbowie voices were telling anybody who'd
listen that the four goals they lost might have been 10. In a word that
will be used with much frequency next month, the Bankies were blitzed.
Iain Munro, the Hamilton manager, does not so much give quotes after
matches as conduct seminars. He seeks to educate the scribes. The crude
gist of all he said will have to suffice.
Accies have enrolled many bright but young players who are circulated
in and out of the team to keep them fresh. Right from the start they are
told that if they get on in their trade, offers of better jobs with
bigger clubs will not be discouraged.
Obviously from Saturday's show they are also taught to enjoy their
employment. There was boyish ambition about much of their work.
Peter Duffield added lethal class, taking a hat trick to bring his
total to 24 goals. All of his three hits followed passing moves which
suggested good improvisation based on thorough rehearsal.
Hamilton's gaudy performance started with a black moment for Clydebank
defender Colin Sutherland. A weak attempt to head the ball to his
goalkeeper against a strong wind allowed Steve McCormick to slip in the
opener.
Clydebank played badly but the luck they had was worse.
On the half-hour the unfortunate Sutherland had to leave the field to
be followed off crucially by Scott Murdoch. He had been allowed to limp
for longer than seemed sensible. Since his bruising presence was proving
so important it was understandable.
Without Murdoch, a regrouping for the second half saved Clydebank from
humiliation. They kept Hamilton out until Duffield's third right at the
end.
Ken Eadie scored with one penalty for Clydebank and failed with a
second, Allan Ferguson moving fast and low to his right post.
Eadie's successful shot ended at least one barren sequence. According
to a Kilbowie chronicler in the match programme, Clydebank had failed to
score from a penalty for 76 matches.
Three games remain to survive -- against Stranraer, St Mirren, and
Dunfermline Athletic. ''One victory might do it, but we still have to
win it,'' Brian Wright, the manager, said after the twelfth home league
game without a win. Again according to the anonymous Kilbowie
chronicler, that's as bad as it has ever been for the Bankies.

Dundee 0, Raith Rovers 2.
RAITH Rovers' Under-21 international striker Steve Crawford may yet
turn round and disappoint the clubs who are currenty pursuing him.
After scoring against Dundee to send Raith back to the top of the
first division and back to the role as favourites to reach the premier
division, Crawford shrugged off the transfer talk which has surrounded
him in recent weeks.
''Look,'' he said after the Dens Park victory, ''it would not be the
end of the world for me if Raith won promotion and I was to stay with
them in the top 10.
''That is not something which would upset me. What has upset me a
little bit recently is all the speculation which has been going on about
a possible transfer.
''I think that has affected my performances. That is only my second
goal in two months. The last one was against Clydebank, I think. My
total for the season is 13, but the goals had dried up a bit and I think
it was because of all the talk about my moving.''
Crawford, a success for the Scottish Under-21 side this season, does
not rule out moving on from the Kirkcaldy club -- but it is clearly not
a high priority for the 21-year-old striker.
He admits: ''I am ambitious and if a big club did want me then I would
have to look at it. I will probably sit down in the summer and talk to
the manager about my situation. But I still have a year of my current
contract deal remaining.''
Rangers have been tipped as favourites to bid for the player Raith
boss Jimmy Nicholl values at close to #1m. Motherwell and Celtic are
also interested and Nicholl has already knocked back a bid of #600,000
for the player who joined the Fife club from Rosyth Recreation three
years ago.
On the promotion battle, Crawford stressed: ''We were disappointed
last week when we lost to Airdrie because we all felt we should have won
that game even when we went down to 10 men.
''We deserved to win again today and this time we did. The manager is
a great motivator and while we sagged after the Coca-Cola Cup win -- the
results did dip a little and we had too many drawn games -- he lifted us
and told us to go on and finish the job in the league.
''That's what we want to do.''
Raith scored their goals in a 10-minute second half spell when winger
Barry Wilson scored the first himself in 68 minutes and then set up the
second for Crawford 12 minutes from the end.
For Dundee, of course, who had gone back to the top of the table the
previous week, the result was s serious setback. A victory would have
placed them in prime position for a return to the premier division.
Defeat pushed them down into third place again behind the two Fife
teams, Rovers and Dunfermline.
Groaned Duffy: ''Raith were hungrier for a result than we were today.
I don't know why that was. I know people will put it down to nerves but
I don't accept that.
''Sometimes you send a team out to do a certain job and ask them to
play in a certain way. But once players go out there, for whatever
reason, they start to play a different game from the one you intended.
That happened to us today. I can't explain that.
''Still, before the game I said this was not a decider and that's the
way I still feel about the promotion situation. There are nine points to
play for and it's the positions on May 14, not those on April 22, which
eventually count.''
Raith and Dunfermline must still meet on the run-in and there may yet
be an opportunity for Duffy's men to sneak into a play-off spot, but the
championship itself may now be outwith their reach.
Raith remain without defender Shaun Dennis and striker Ally Graham.
But they did not have these two players at Dundee and their absence made
little difference to the Rovers' performance.
Dennis will be eligible to return for the last game of the season
against Hamilton away from home. Graham, though, would not be free of
suspension until the play-offs.
Manager Jimmy Nicholl, who wants to avoid that route to the top 10,
said: ''I've told Ally that I don't want to see him playing again until
next season. That would mean we would win promotion without the two
extra games.
''We rode our luck a few times out there against Dundee but, really,
they only troubled us with a free kick from Neil McCann in that second
half.
''After we scored I felt our confidence grew. I know how Jim Duffy
must feel -- because we felt the same way last week.
''But nothing is cut and dried and we all know that. We have to
continue this kind of performance now against St Johnstone next week.
This is a very tight league.''
The demands of the season have been severe. The penalties for those
who miss out on promotion could be even more serious. There were almost
8000 people at Dens Park on Saturday.
How many will there be next season if Dundee are left behind in the
lower league struggling for their very survival?

DIVISION TWO:
ALL five games in the second division finished level on Saturday but
there were winners and losers just the same.
Not one of the top six teams found the net, but the leading two can be
thankful that the effect was to bring the winning post a little closer.
Stenhousemuir really were the losers in their goalless encounter
against the leaders Dumbarton.
Murdo MacLeod's team remained a point above Morton and three ahead of
their hosts, thanks to a ridiculous decision by referee Ian Taylor.
The erstwhile strict disciplinarian, who until recent times gave the
impression that he would favour the introduction of capital punishment
for offenders on the football field, distinguished himself in another
way by being the only person at Ochilview who apparently did not see
Dumbarton defender Jim Marsland handle the ball in his own penalty area
five minutes into the second half.
'Muir manager Terry Christie said little later, but at the time of the
incident he sprang from the home dugout like a whippet out of the traps.
He did, however, concede later that Dumbarton had created the two best
chances of the match. But, as he also observed, the windy conditions
spoiled the game.
The Warriors do not seem to carry the kind of luck that accompanies
successful promotion contenders.
They suffered another blow when veteran Adrian Sprott was taken off
injured, and he may have to sit out the rest of the season.
Morton stayed second and were grateful to David Wylie for two fine
late saves which kept out Queen of the South at Greenock. Should Allan
McGraw's side fail to go up, their inability to defeat the Dumfries side
in four league games this season -- two home draws and two away defeats
-- will certainly have been a contributing factor.
Big defender Garry Paterson hit the woodwork for Kevin Drinkell's side
in Stirling Albion's goalless draw at Berwick and Clyde also drew a
blank at Brechin, where the home side's Ralph Brand hit a post and later
the bar.
An 18-yard drive by Stuart Sorbie gave Meadowbank an early lead at
Methil, but Trinidadian Arnold Dawarika netted a second-half penalty for
East Fife that has almost certainly doomed Jim Leishman's team to the
third division.
* STEVE Archibald's East Fife are set for two very glamourous close
season friendlies.
The Methil outfit will travel to play a Barcelona select in July, and
return from their trip to Spain and face up to the might of Alex
Ferguson's Manchester United.
Archibald said: ''Some details have still to be ironed out for the
trip to Barcelona, but it looks like we will play a match against their
reserve side. I reckon their first team must be running scared.
''Seriously, though, the match will give the players an idea of the
skill levels and dedication of the European players and give them
something to work on.
''The Manchester United match will be at Bayview and is a testimonial
for former East Fife player and manager Jimmy Bonthrone.
''Alex knows him from his days with Aberdeen and has promised to bring
a strong squad north for the match.''
A date for the match has yet to be confirmed, but it is likely to be a
curtain-raiser for the new season in August.
Archibald may well face up to his former Spanish employers and his old
manager at Aberdeen in a new playing role.
East Fife faced Meadowbank on Saturday with three at the back,
including manager Archibald at sweeper.
Archibald said: ''The lads adapted well to the new system and it's
something I will be working on over the next few months.''

THE Rugby World Cup, savoured and anticipated for so long, is now
almost with us. On Saturday, the Scottish squad departs for two altitude
acclimatization games in Madrid -- against the Spanish Barbarians and
the Spanish national side -- and then all roads lead to Pretoria in
South Africa.
Scotland play pool games against Ivory Coast on May 26 and Tonga four
days later. But the crunch game for the Scottish side is that against
France in the Test arena of the Loftus Versfeld stadium, Pretoria, on
June 3. A defeat against the French would mean a likely meeting with the
All Blacks, so a win over France would be welcome to say the least.
One man perfectly placed to adjudicate on the current respective
merits of Scotland and France is Romanian captain Tiberiu Brinza. Within
the space of 14 days, the accomplished No.8 forward has led his side
against the Scots and the French.
Sixteen days ago in Bucharest, the French struggled to record a 24-15
victory over Romania. At Murrayfield on Saturday, the Scots were much
more impressive as they demolished Romania 49-16.
Brinza is adamant that Scotland are the better side. He declared:
''The French play in a different style but we had much more trouble
today against Scotland than we did against France.
''Some of the spontaneous play of the Scots today caused us real
problems. The play of the Scottish threequarters, in particular, caused
us a lot of trouble.''
Would then, he was asked, Scotland defeat France in Pretoria? Brinza,
even allowing for the fact that his side had just been taken apart by
Scotland and that good manners might have precluded any other answer,
unhesitatingly replied: ''Oh yes.''
For Scotland on Saturday, one of the most encouraging aspects of the
game plan was the manner in which the side strung together passages of
telling continuity rugby with the ball in hand. With the hard ground of
South Africa beckoning, team manager Duncan Paterson had observed in
advance of the game that it was the intention to play fluent rugby, and
so it proved.
Afterwards, the Scottish captain Gavin Hastings declared that this
would be the style which they would take with them to South Africa.
There was some discussion, too, at the after-match press conference as
to the decision to bring brother Scott on for Hastings as the skipper
went lame after a collision with Craig Joiner in the seventy-ninth
minute of the match.
On the replacements' bench, Cameron Glasgow was itching to get on for
his first cap but, instead, the role of filling the captain's boots went
to Scott. There was, perhaps, an argument to be made for getting
Glasgow's debut cap in the bag -- albeit a 60-second one -- before the
departure for South Africa but, said Paterson, the plan had always been
that if misfortune befell the captain, then Hastings Jr should step in.
Whether this indicates that the powers-that-be view Scott as the
likely successor to Gavin in the full back berth once the captain has
hung up his boots next season remains, for the moment, a matter only of
interesting conjecture. More inter-

FIVE Asians have been arrested for attempting to rig matches at the
World Under-20 Championships in Qatar. Portugal, Honduras, and Cameroons
revealed that their players had been offered sex and bribes to throw
games.
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said: ''Several players were asked to go
shopping so that they could be approached by members of a betting
syndicate.
''We know who these people are and that they have been working in
football for some time now. They brought prostitues here for the players
so that they could be photographed and then blackmailed, if necessary.
''We are certain that there was no sexual contact between them and the
players and that they are totally innocent.
''But corruption is like a cancer. It is difficult to get rid of it
once it takes hold. Only in the beginning is there a chance to stop it
and this is what we are doing now.''
The five are believed to be members of a cartel from Malaysia where
numerous cases of bribery have emerged.
The championships were switched to Qatar by FIFA after Nigeria, the
original venue, was cancelled because of health and security risks.
* FIFA have also promised severe punishment for the Portuguese
internationalist Luis Figo if his club, Sporting Lisbon, lodges an
official complaint over his transfer activities.
Last October, Figo secretly negotiated a #3m move to Juventus at the
end of this season. But when Parma came on the scene two months ago, he
had a change of mind and signed for them.
When both Italian clubs learned of his duplicity, they backed off
leaving Figo with apparently nowhere to go until last week when it was
announced that he had agreed a four-year contract with Barcelona.
Barcelona, however, will not match the valuation that Juventus placed
on the player and are prepared to settle his fee before a tribunal.
The messy business has upset FIFA. Secretary General Sepp Blatter
warned: ''If his club takes action, Figo will not play for a long time.
He could be suspended for the duration of the longest contract he signed
which is for four years.''
* AN astonishing faux pas by Giovanni Trapattoni could cost Bayern
Munich #5m in lost income.
When the Italian coach brought on both his substitutes in last week's
game against Eintracht Frankfurt, Bayern had four amateurs in the team
which breached Bundesliga rules.
Bayern won the game 4-2 but the German FA look likely to overturn the
result in Frankfurt's favour.
General manager Uli Hoeness admitted: ''The loss of two points could
cost us a place in the UEFA Cup next season. Trapattoni's mistake could
be the most expensive ever made.''

'I feel that South Africa has been cleansed of a system foisted upon
us, one which our grandchildren will never understand'
Gary Player is about to complete a double at the Home of Golf. Already
the South African with a Scottish ancestry has been made an honorary
member of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, and now the man who has
established a charitable trust to educate black children is to receive
an honorary doctorate from St Andrews University. ALISTER NICOL reports.
GARY Player is a proud man. He has much of which to be proud. The
trophy room in the mansion on his 1000-acre Blair Atholl ranch, half an
hour's drive from Johannesburg, displays only the most cherished of the
multitude of prizes and awards he has won in a golfing career spanning
five decades in the course of which the wee Man in Black had the
temerity and talent to take on, and beat in their prime, those giants of
American golf, Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. He beat everyone else in
sight as well, recording more than 150 worldwide wins.
The 5ft 6ins Springbok son of a gold miner takes great pride in the
fact that along with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, and Nicklaus he completes
a unique quartet who have landed the Grand Slam of Open, US Open, US
Masters, and USPGA titles.
He is also inordinately proud of his Scottish ancestry. His maternal
grandmother was a Glaswegian and, he revealed to me on a recent visit to
Blair Atholl, his grandfather was born in Iona. Several years ago in
Florida, Player told me, brown eyes gleaming like burnished brass: ''I
feel so proud to be a Scot.'' He had just been to see the movie Chariots
of Fire.
He also is very proud of the fact that last year he was made an
honorary member of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, and
the kid who left school at 14 (his mother died when he was eight) will
positively puff with pride when he is presented with an honorary
doctorate by St Andrews University this year.
Gary Player is also a big-time racehorse breeder in his native South
Africa and in Kentucky, the home of thoroughbred racing in the States,
as well as being a highly successful business man throughout the world.
Pride of place in his achievements has little to do with sport. It is
his Gary Player Foundation in general and his Blair Atholl School in
particular. He established the charitable trust in 1988 with the prime
objective of addressing the crisis in black education in South Africa.
The school, which has close links with Rangers FC, caters for 70
children under six, a further 270 up to the age of 13/14, and a
computer-age community Resource Centre which attracts around 50 adults.
''I am very proud of Blair Atholl school and the work we are doing
here,'' said Player, ''particularly now that South Africa is genuinely a
free democracy. I feel that at last the country has been cleansed of a
system foisted upon us, one which I am sure our grandchildren will never
be able to understand.
''Nelson Mandela is a great man and one whom history may well mark
down as one of the greatest statesmen of all time. He and my other good
friend F W de Clerck thoroughly deserved the Nobel Peace Prize,'' added
Player whose career, and therefore his earning potential in his prime,
was severely handicapped because the rest of the world did not want to
know South Africa.
He suffered physical hardships as well such as having ice thrown in
his eyes during US Tournaments and needing police protection as he
played. He estimates apartheid, with all its ramifications, cost him
''many millions of dollars, no pounds.''
Now at the age of 60 he is doing all he can to assist disadvantaged
black Africans make up some of the leeway, and his efforts have not gone
unnoticed by the new President of the Republic of South Africa.
Gary Player is a rich man with a large home, a large family, and an
increasing number of grandchildren, but among his proudest possessions
is a single sheet of paper.
The notepaper is headed African National Congress and part of the
letter reads: ''The outstanding educational facilities which you are
providing at Blair Atholl School are not only benefiting the
disadvantaged childern in your own area, but can serve as a model for
educational development and renewal in other parts of South Africa.
''I congratulate you and your dedicated staff on the fine work being
undertaken at Blair Atholl and fully support your existing and future
endeavours. I hope that Blair School will continue to play a valuable
and important role in the future of our society.''
The letter is signed ''Nelson R Mandela, President.''

IN ENGLAND, By Steve Tongue
PLAYERS from Blackburn Rovers and Arsenal, as well as numerous
established internationalists, were not the only absentees from Terry
Venables' weekend get-together at Aston Villa's training ground near The
Belfry golf course.
Coach Bryan Robson, as the player-manager of Middlesbrough, also had
more important things on his mind as the Endsleigh League leaders chased
a place in the Premiership.
With England unable to arrange a fixture on Wednesday, the value of
calling together a group of fringe players (only five of the 18 had full
caps) may have been of limited value.
Whatever benefit Venables took from the exercise, however, it was a
good weekend for Robson. A Yorkshire derby away to Barnsley, who still
had play-off ambitions, was a testing fixture and Middlesbrough's 1-1
draw, earned by Jan Aage Fjortoft's goal, took them three points clear
of Bolton, who have played one game less.
The real bonus for Robson had come the night before, when both Bolton
and third-placed Tranmere Rovers were beaten. Wolves could have lifted
themselves into second place, but a last-minute equaliser cost them two
points in a 3-3 draw at Sheffield United.
So with only one automatic promotion place available, as the Premier
League is belatedly reduced from 22 clubs to 20, the top five are
separated by five points, with the first three all having scored the
same number of goals (the deciding factor if teams are level on points.)
To intensify the drama all the more, some of the contenders still have
to go head-to-head, with Tranmere (third) at home to Wolves (fourth) and
then Middlesbrough (top) in the final week of the season.
Forever the poor relations on Merseyside, Tranmere would be a popular
choice to reach the highest division for the first time in their
history, if only to give Scotland's Pat Nevin and Ireland's John
Aldridge another chance to play at that level. For similar reasons, many
are willing Bruce Rioch's Bolton to go up, taking the more precocious
talents of Jason McAteer and centre-half Alan Stubbs with him.
Wolves, seeking a better class of football to put on their
magnificently renovated Molineux stage, have certainly provided their
share of entertainment in recent weeks, 3-3 becoming the most regular
scoreline. Graham Taylor made headlines he would rather have avoided on
Saturday by attempting (unsuccessfully) a citizen's arrest on a
Sheffield United supporter who spat at him following the game.
Of the teams likely to contest the play-offs the outsiders, in every
sense, are Reading, promoted only last season and already guaranteed the
highest league position in their history.
The departure of Mark McGhee to Leicester last December has not
hindered their progress, though their Elm Park ground would be something
of an embarrassment to the Premier League: with two uncovered ends,
seating on only one side and a capacity of 14,000, it is something of a
relic in these post-Taylor days.
The champions of the two lower divisions may well prove to be the
teams who yesterday enjoyed a day out at Wembley in the Auto Windscreens
Shield final. A crowd of 76,663 saw Birmingham beat Carlisle United 1-0
after extra time.

HIGHLAND League champions Huntly can afford to pay as much attention
to the record books as they do to the opposition these days.
A 3-3 draw against Clach nudged their league goal tally to 99, and
with one remaining fixture the Strathbogie men know a memorable
achievement is within their grasp.
Elgin City's 103-goal total from 1989-90 was the highest champions'
total for 25 years but Huntly can overhaul that if they put five past
Fort William on the final day of the season this Saturday.
Ironically, the current champions' manager, Steve Paterson, was in
charge at Elgin when City set that record.
Keeper John Gardiner stepped up to take the penalty which gave the
champions the lead against Clach and Marco De Barros and Gary Whyte
added more.
Yet Clach produced one of their best displays of the season to
surprisingly deny Huntly another win. Stuart Golabeck (2) and Alan
Richardson earned the Inverness side a moral victory.
The suspicion remains that Huntly would have won had they needed the
points, but with their rested stars coming back for the championship
presentation this weekend, Fort William are unlikely to find them in
charitable mood when records are at stake.
Elsewhere in a depleted fixture card, Rothes striker John Teasdale,
the former Wolves and Blackpool striker and Elgin City manager, brought
the curtain down on his colourful career when he retired after their 3-1
defeat at Cove Rangers.
Dave Caldwell (2) and Mike Beattie struck for Cove, who now look
likely to finish second, with Chris Pilichos pulling one back for
Rothes.
Keith's three-game winning run was brought to an end by Brora Rangers
who won 2-1 thanks to David Ross and Andy MacKay. Andy Lavelle got
Keith's consolation.
Gary Clark got the only goal as Lossiemouth were 1-0 winners at Fort
William.

JUNIORS
GLENAFTON had a a convincing win on Saturday in their build-up to this
week's OVD Scottish Cup semi-final at Love Street, Paisley. Goals from
Scott Archer (2) and Gerry Rodger took them through against Kello Rovers
in the Cumnock and Doon Cup.
Whitburn appear to be hitting top form at the right time. They
continued their good run with a 4-0 win against Ormiston. Scottish
internationalist Davie Scott hit a hat trick with Steven McIlhone
netting the other. The other cup semi-finalists Camelon did not play.
Glenafton (23 goals) and Camelon (21 goals) lead the OVD Cup national
goal scoring award. The OVD Award for top goal scorer in the cup
competition is currently being contested by Chris Wilson of Arthurlie
(nine goals) and David Flynn of Camelon and Tom MacKenzie of Glenafton,
who are both on eight.
The pressure at the top of the Reebok League premier division may be
starting to affect leaders Pollok. They could only draw 0-0 with Vale of
Clyde, allowing Arthurlie to narrow the gap to 10 points.
Arthurlie had a narrow 1-0 victory over Petershill, but they owe a
debt to their keeper, Sandy McLean, who had a series of outstanding
saves in the first half to keep Arthurlie in the game. The winning goal
was scored by Steven Convery in the second half.
Neilston Juniors recorded their fourth successive victory -- all away
from home -- and began to move clear of the relegation zone in the first
division. New signings Jimmy Robertson and Billy Green scored the goals
which gave them the points against Forth on Saturday.
With the chasing pack all losing points, Benburb's 1-0 victory over
Blantyre Vics thanks to a Nisbet goal takes them closer to clinching the
first division championship.
A Jim Arthur header gave Irvine Meadow victory over Beith. Results:

'Durranty and Fergie have been a big help. They understand what it is
like to be from Glasgow and to play for Rangers. I mean, suddenly you
are being recognised in the street'
CHARLIE Miller is a Glasgow boy, which is something the young Rangers
players does not let you forget.
His conversation is littered with references to his native city, how
he grew up in Castlemilk, and just how special it all is that he has
been able as a more or less local boy to play in the Ibrox first team.
There have not been too many Glaswegians who have played for the
champions over the years. Now, though, there are three in the first team
squad, Miller, Ian Durrant and Ian Ferguson.
Durrant was a product of the youth policy which was pushed under way
by former manager John Greig, now back at Ibrox as the club's public
relations officer.
Miller has come from the programme which was set up by Graeme Souness
and Walter Smith when they took over at the club nine years ago.
Dundee United chairman Jim McLean, who knows probably more about
developing young players than anyone else in the Scottish game, has long
maintained that the fruits of any development programme won't be seen
for almost a decade.
Young Charlie has come through a year early. He has been a bonus for
Smith in a season when the Ibrox men had to dip deep into their
resources, at times, to get a recognisable team on the park in premier
division matches.
Yet, if he had had his way he would have been playing even sooner.
''I had set myself a target, you always try to do that, don't you,''
he grins, ''and I wanted to get into the team by the time I was 17. That
was my dream, but it has taken me just a little bit longer. Even now, I
am not accepting that I am there to stay because I know how difficult it
is to hold on to a first-team place.
''There was real competition this season, and that could be even more
severe next year if the club brings in the other players they have been
talking about.
''This has been the most important year in my career because I have
played so regularly and I have helped the team get another championship.
''Next year could be the most challenging, but I think that I will be
ready for that.''
Miller's connection with the club goes back to his primary school days
in Castlemilk when he joined Rangers Boys' Club at the age of
nine-and-a-half.
''I had played for another club before then, for six months or so,''
he remembers, but then the chance came to go to the Rangers' club and
that was that.
''My Uncle Jimmy and my Uncle Benny used to encourage me. They came to
the games, they gave me advice, and then I signed for Rangers three
years ago, though I had been training at the club since I was around 12
and they have always been there watching me. They have been big
influences.
''Here at the club Billy Kirkwood and John McGregor were great to me
when I was coming through and Durranty and Fergie have been a big help.
''They understand how things are because, like me, they're Glasgow
boys. They understand what it is like to be from Glasgow and to play for
Rangers. I mean, suddenly you are being recognised in the street and
things like that.
''You just have to get used to that but when you're just an ordinary
Glasgow boy that isn't always easy. They have helped me get through that
kind of thing.''
Others have helped, too. Notably manager Walter Smith who has
carefully kept Miller away from the full glare of the media spotlight.
There is no doubt that Smith recognises the 19-year-old's precocious
talents.
Equally, he wants to nurture these skills until Miller matures into
the player of stature everyone in the game predicts he will be.
Miller said: ''I had one chance last season, up at Aberdeen, and I
didn't do it. I let myself down and I felt I let everyone else down too.
It was a hard lesson for me because before the game I thought that I was
ready.
''When that happens it tends to stay with you, and it means you don't
get carried away.
''It will be important for me next season if I can become a regular in
the first team. It will be important, too, if the team can get into the
Champions' League. I can remember the last time Rangers went through.
The buzz around the place was amazing and, if you look back, Marseille
won it but they were not able to beat us over two games. We were very
close to winning the European Cup that year.''
Outside of football, Miller has few interests. ''I like the racing,''
he grins mischievously, ''and I used to play golf a wee bit up at Linn
Park. But I haven't played for quite a while now. I used to get a bit
fed up playing in the rain and that.''
Away from sport he listens to music, to Pink Floyd and to Bob Marley.
''Reggae is my main thing,'' he says.
Basically, though, like most Glasgow boys -- and if you look at the
current Rangers list of players, you will see more and more potential
local heroes -- Miller's main love is football.
Kenny Dalglish will always be in his personal list of greats, along
with Pele and Maradona, and Ian Durrant will always get a mention from
this son of Castlemilk.
There are no prizes on offer for guessing which city Dalglish and
Durrant were born in. For anyone who doesn't know then Charlie Miller
will tell them -- with a fair degree of civic pride.

THE nicest thing you can say about Motherwell Civic Centre is that it
makes surrounding hovels look picturesque.
Yet it has something to commend it. It is big enough, well-served
enough, and tries hard to attract events as well as customers and
spectators. It attracted both on Saturday night for the European
Championship Thai Boxing.
In what was billed as the biggest Thai Boxing show in Scotland, the
final show was Duncan Airlie James, Scotland's super light heavyweight
and Commonwealth Thai Boxing champion, versus the experienced English
kick-boxer, Mark Russell of Manchester, a roaring match promoted by
Stephen Mair, well known in the business. Airlie James is a professional
and fights full-time and manages himself.
Young entrepreneur Bill McEvoy, a 28-year-old businessman from
Hamilton, who runs, beside a successful building firm, the major
promotions for Pro-Am Kickbox, has several full-time fighters and
believes that the future for the sport is alive and, well, kicking, and
it is people like Mair and McEvoy who are out to develop this sport.
You can add famed boxing promotor Alex Morrison and his daughter
Katherine, who permit many of the kick-boxers to train in their gym. The
fight game in all its forms is very tight indeed and everybody knows
each other in the industry.
In this, the promoters might very well be proved right in their
optimism. The World Kickboxing Association has 44 countries as members,
ranging from Russia to Japan to Australia and every country you can
think of. Clearly, it doesn't have the same level of finance that the
obscenities of orthodox boxing can contrive to achieve, but on the other
hand it doesn't have the obscenities either.
The young men who kick-box (women also participate in this sport,
rather to my own sense of disapprobation) are young and supremely fit,
and though Bill McEvoy is sponsoring his young fighters, he cannot pay
the huge sums commanded in the gloves sport.
Yet he has a stable of people who can attract support. Apart from
other youngsters, he has rather a superb athlete in Jan Cree of
Hamilton, a young lad of 26 who started pro about three years ago having
initially started off in the martial arts business. McCree is from
Whitehill in Hamilton, a less-than-prosperous district, and his father
is of Polish origin. He is already a Scottish international and is rated
world No.8 with two British and two Scottish titles. He was scheduled
for a three-round exhibition bout against Glasgow's Ritchie McCue. I
watched the exhibition. Both lads were pulling punches and kicks. The
way they were pulling I'd rather pull the Finnieston ferry across the
Clyde. Both also started off in the martial arts.
This is a thread running through kick-boxing. Co-ordinator of the
event at the weekend, Ms Joan Gilmartin, started off herself in the
martial arts business, and young Mark Scott, who is shortly to defend
his Scottish title, started in karate as well. He is a most unlikely
kick-boxer really. From Giffnock, he has a accent which I identified
immediately, and indeed correctly, as hailing from Hutcheson's Grammar:
you meet all sorts in specialist sports. Mark was one of the boys in the
corner for Airlie James in his Euro title fight.
Inevitably there is a showbiz element to the tourney, boxing of
whatever kind is like that. Each round was heralded by the usual lovely
marching round the ring which one sees at boxing matches, to the usaul
barrage of wolf-whistles. (The girl was clad in marvellously tight pink
cycling shorts and clearly enjoyed every minute of the admiration
bestowed upon her, so there). Glamour was everywhere, in the lovely
girlfriends and wives and the smart suits of their consorts. It is part
of the culture of sport and will ever remain thus. Even wur photographer
had thought about bringing his own girlfriend and if you don't mind me
saying so Jeff, she wis a stoatir. There is a reason for this. Sport
tends to attract nice and healthy people, and a feeling for publicity at
every level. In the case of this emerging sport in Britain it is
important that this should be so.
But sadly the top of the bill, the James-Russell fight, England v
Scotland, ended in disaster for 33-year-old Airlie James. A kick to the
head saw him downed and knock out in the third round. The gash in his
head was dreadful: I would guess at least two inches, and there was a
lot of blood. (This sort of injury is, in fact, rare in kick-boxing but
don't forget that Thai is a little different in that, as distinct from
kick-boxing -- which, though with antecedents in France and the Basque
country, is of American origin -- the sport is of eastern origin and
permits blows to any part of the body save the groin and the back of the
head). The routine check-up in nearby Laws Hospital saw James attended
to in minutes but it does seem indeed a blow to his career, though
promotor Stephen Mair hopes that a world title fight with Sean Johnston
from Wigan can yet be set up.
It was late when I got back to my native city. Naturally I was asked
where I'd been. I told them Thai kick-boxing in Motherwell. Enjoyed I
said. ''In Motherwell?'' the chums asked. ''Wis it no cold in the
street?'' I drew myself up to whatever height I could manage and told
them flippancy didn't register. I never saw more dedication and nicer
folk. In Motherwell Civic Centre at that.

the results of a photographic survey published yesterday by the British

photographs were taken from an aircraft. It was possible to be so
accurate on numbers because gannets breed in geometrically spaced nests
with an adult bird sitting on the egg at all times.

A PARENTS' organisation is calling for long-term surveillance of
children who have suffered side-effects after being vaccinated against
measles.
The pressure group, Jabs, fears that febrile convulsions in the wake
of vaccination could have long-term consequences for some children,
including epilepsy and learning difficulties.
It claims the recent campaign to immunise every schoolchild in Britain
against measles and rubella -- regardless of whether they had had the
disease or vaccine before -- may have put more children at risk.
Jabs was set up after the triple measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)
vaccine -- introduced for babies in 1988 -- was allegedly followed by a
number of incidents leading to neurological damage and death.
In 1992, two of the three forms of MMR used in the UK, including the
one most widely used in Glasgow, were withdrawn by the Department of
Health because of a series of transient cases of aseptic meningitis,
attributable to the Urabe strain of mumps vaccine used.
However, a recent report by the Public Health Laboratory Service
(PHLS) estimated that one in 3000 babies who receive the MMR vaccine
would be admitted to hospital within 6-11 days suffering febrile
convulsion as a result of the measles component, which remains the same.
Measles vaccine was given to most of Scotland's 800,000 Scottish
schoolchildren in a #2m campaign which ran for three months at the end
of last year.
The aim was to vaccinate children who were too old to have received
the MMR as babies and to boost the immunity of the others -- the vaccine
fails to immunise one child in ten.
The campaign was prompted to counter an anticipated epidemic of
measles, and the fear that there was a growing population of older
children who had been neither vaccinated nor acquired immunity from
younger children. The rubella vaccine was included to reduce the risk
for pregnant mothers whose immunity may have worn off.
The organiser of Jabs, Mrs Jacqueline Fletcher, said yesterday that
instead of vaccinating every child the schools' campaign should have
tested the children's immunity levels.
''I believe if they had done blood testing in schools . . . they would
have found 10% who really needed it and could have got it from their GP.
I don't believe it would have cost much more to do this,'' she said.
Mrs Fletcher revealed that her son Robert had had a convulsion 10 days
after receiving MMR and had developed epilepsy and severe learning
diffficulties.
She said: ''We have been saying that the measles part is causing as
many problems as the mumps.
''If we are getting evidence of convulsions it is important to find
out if they have followed this up to establish if they have resulted in
epilepsy or severe learning difficulties.
''We are asking if the authorities have made arrangements to study
these children as they develop, and if not, why not?''
The PHLS report, published in the Lancet, was based on a study of five
districts in England, linking records of babies with convulsions and
other vaccine-associated conditions.
A PHLS spokesman said that ferbile convulsions were a known
side-effect of measles vaccine, and that the overall results of the
investigation were reassuring.
It was aimed at establishing a more sensitive alternative to the
Yellow Card system, through which doctors report adverse reactions to
drugs or vaccines to the Committee on the Safety of Medicines.
''Some reactions have been under-reported through the Yellow Card
system, but the increased number of vaccine components being given to
children is drawing in more reports which prove to be spurious,'' the
spokesman added.
But Mrs Fletcher pointed out: ''With convulsions we have children who
did not get as far as hospital and the GP took care of it at home.
''The study suggests better surveillance for adverse reaction. We find
adverse reactions are not being reported.
''We have asked parents whose children had convulsions if the doctors
had reported it -- 205 responses came back and in only seven cases had
the doctor told the monitoring body.''

Dunfermline 3, Ayr United
SIMON says a lot but there comes a time when the talking has to stop,
making way for action and that time is now.
Ayr United's manager Simon Stainrod smiled quietly while a television
flickered by his side at East End Park on Saturday.
On the screen was the Division One table, showing the world just what
a mess his club now find themselves in, with only three matches
remaining.
The Englishman's eyes flashed to the screen and his demeanour changed
instantly. ''We are still in there with a little chance,'' he said, but
in his words there was no hint of sincerity.
Ayr are three points adrift from third-bottom place and with it
safety, but now the problem is, so much to do in so little time.
It is not a mission impossible, of course, but Ayr's plight now runs
that scenario a very close second.
Stainrod was still talking a good game, but then he always does, after
this latest defeat, but the glimmer of hope for those connected with the
club is that on Saturday, when Hamilton are faced in Glasgow, Stainrod
will again pull on the boots and be joined by others who have been
critically absent in recent times for the big, final push.
Problems and Ayr United have kept in step all season, and the manager
moaned about how gruesome a time his club were having in the lower
reaches of the table, and how their plight would be less fretful had
Lady Luck glanced in their direction even now and again as regards
injuries and suspensions.
He may well have been correct, but the task now on hand should not be
belittled.
Winning three in a row when one's livelihood is at stake sounds
possible, but what must be remembered is that Ayr have been successful
only five times in the league campaign all season, their players have
yet to collect a win bonus on the road, and two of their last games are
away from Somerset Park.
They should be wished well in the struggle, for the sport would be a
little less colourful had a character like Stainrod to be lost to the
even lower reaches of football obscurity.
Of course, one man's anguish means glee for others and with the result
at Dens Park in mind -- which means that Dunfermline move back up the
table -- smiles were prevalent on the faces of those attached to the
home club on Saturday.
''Win our last three games and we will be champions,'' said East End
Park assistant manager Dick Campbell, adding that his players would not
have to venture out of their Kingdom so to do.
He's right, but, like Ayr, great danger lurks ahead in the remaining
games for the ones who would be king.
They can expect no favours when Airdrie come calling on Saturday, then
Dunfermline must make the arduous trek along to Stark's Park where Raith
Rovers also have their sights set on the title.
However, Campbell had little regard for the future, content with his
men's performance and one in particular.
''I was very pleased for Andy Tod,'' said Campbell.
''We thought about playing him up front, knowing the kind of game to
expect, but I'm pleased that we didn't.
''If there is a better player in the First Division, I haven't seen
him.'' Praise indeed.
Tod completed the scoring with 10 minutes remaining after having been
advised by Campbell from the touchline that perhaps, instead of standing
around idle with a corner about to be taken, he should gallop upfield
and try his luck.
He did what he was told, heading the ball home with authority, adding
to strikes by Norrie McCathie and Craig Robertson.
The scoring may have ended at 80 minutes, but not the entertainment,
for, with three minutes remaining Ayr keeper Stuart McIntosh who had
performed his duties well, proceeded to clutch the ball when well
outside of his zone, and was sent packing.
When quizzing Stainrod about the incident, excuses were dredged up by
some for the young man, but his overseer dismissed such remarks.
''He just took a brainstorm,'' said Stainrod. ''Quite bizarre, wasn't
it?''
Bizarre indeed, and just what Stainrod doesn't need just now.

THE scramble for places in next season's Marine Harvest national
league continues in both north and south, with Saturday's results
ensuring a tight finish.
Glenurquhart's 6-4 win over under-strength Lovat at Kiltarlity means
there could be a three-way tie for the final place, with all three --
Glenurquhart, Lovat and Skye -- having to play Fort William, who are
assured of their own place, in their last game.
Lovat are the least well placed having won 10 points from their 13
matches. Glenurquhart and Skye have 12. Lovat face Fort William first
knowing they are out of the race if they lose.
The crucial league games cannot now take place until May 3 at the
earliest as Fort William are tied up on Camanachd Cup duty this weekend.
In the south, four clubs compete for two places with Oban Camanachd
and Glasgow Mid Argyll now assured of their spots.
Mid Argyll are virtually certain to qualify as a result of Ernie
Crawford's late winner against Oban Celtic.
Mid Argyll have two games left, both against foot-of-the-table
Strachur and only a huge upset will prevent them gaining the points
needed.
The race for league positions in the south now almost certainly hinges
on Oban Celtic's crunch match with Ballachulish this weekend, and Celtic
simply have to win to maintain their interest.

THIRD DIVISION
IT seemed a bit of a gamble at the time when Montrose sacked manager
John Holt a couple of months ago, but their faltering challenge has been
transformed into a relentless charge towards promotion since coach Andy
Dornan took control.
They are now favourites to join Angus neighbours Forfar in the journey
upstairs, by virtue of a run of success which has included good results
in the crucial matches against their rivals.
Now they must do it one more time next Saturday when they are hosts to
East Stirlingshire, who lost this weekend to fall three points behind
them.
Montrose were soon in command at Inverness, where Neil McAvoy gave
them a first-minute lead against Caley Thistle. Colin McGlashan
converted a penalty in 14 minutes, after he had been brought down, and
he made it 3-0 towards the end.
Steve Tosh was the provider as Ian Porteous, with a 10-yard shot, and
David Pew got the Arbroath goals which dumped the 'Shire, who must now
win their three remaining games.
Fortunately for them, they have still to play both their main rivals,
although their closing-day home match against Ross County could be
meaningless if 'Shire lose at Montrose next weekend.
County made heavy weather of beating Albion Rovers 2-1 at Coatbridge.
Andy MacLeod punished an early mistake but a Dave Wilcox header put
Rovers level at the interval only for Robbie Williamson to restore the
lead a minute after the resumption.
Gary Kerr's late 12-yard strike for Queen's Park at Alloa made the
home side's promotion task a near hopeless one and Cowdenbeath were
twice ahead of the new champions at Forfar. An Ian Black shot and Stuart
Wardell penalty each were quickly levelled by Sandy Ross and Don McVicar
respectively.
Cowden are now involved in a four-way battle for sixth place along
with Caley Thistle, Arbroath, and Queen's Park. It may seem meaningless
but the managers will be insisting that places in their squads for next
season are at stake for the players, and non-triers will be saying
farewell to senior football.

WHEN the pressure is on, few teams in Scotland -- or Britain for that
matter -- can hold a candle to Wester Klick Photopoint, the most
successful club in the world of women's hockey.
After losing two matches in the Torrie Stockbrokers National League
this season, it was justifiable thought in many quarters that this would
be the year in which their grip on the domestic scene would be broken.
However, they responded to the challenge over the weekend and after
beating Edinburgh Ladies 1-0 on Saturday in the league and Bonagrass
Grove 2-0 on penalties in yesterday's League Cup final they are now set
for a seventh successive league and cup double.
Their 1-0 defeat of Edinburgh from a strike by Susan MacDonald will
give them most satisfaction for if any side was going to take over the
mantle then the capital girls were the main contenders.
Bonagross Grove from Dundee, another side with thoughts of grandeur,
defended with great stubborness but in truth had it not been for their
goalkeeper Charlotte Jones and a wayward shot by Wendy Fraser there
would have been no need for penalties to settle the issue. Western
keeper Tracey Robb saved all that was thrown at her, allowing Fraser and
Ann Menzie to confirm their victory with successful conversions.
In the other finals, a Bernie Bell goal gave Melrose a 2-1 victory
over Stepps in the final of the League Plate while Heriot Watt
University and Helensburgh captured the Confined Plate and Confined Cup
respectively. Results:
Saturday -- Torrie Stockbrokers National League Division 1 -- Western
Klick Photopoint 1, Edinburgh Ladies 0; Western A 0, Hyndland 3, Heriot
Watt University 4, Grange 0. Divison 2 -- Eglinton 2, Hyndland A 1.
Division 3 -- Hillhead 3, Carmuirs 0. Divison 4 -- Ardrossan 0, Vale of
Leven 0. Confined Plate final -- Heriot Watt University 1, Madras 0.
Confined Cup final -- Hyndland 2, Helensburgh 2 (Helensburgh won 4-3 on
penalties).
Sunday -- League Cup final -- Western Klick Photopoint 0, Bonagross
Grove 0 (Western won 2-0 on penalties). League Plate final -- Melrose 2,
Stepps 1. Torrie Stockbrokers National League -- Division l -- Hyndland

THREE Scots brothers swept the board at a major judo competition --
while on holiday in America.
Schoolboys Daniel, Ross and Ben Watson, scored their success while
visiting friends in Tennessee.
The boys, who train at the Stonehaven Judo Club, near Aberdeen,
entered the state judo competition -- and walked away with first, second
and third prizes.
Mother June, of Woodlands Place, Inverbervie, said: ''They did
extremely well and we are very proud of them all.
''The judges kept mentioning they were from Scotland. I don't think
they have had overseas winners before,'' she said.
Mrs Watson and her husband, John, travelled to America last month to
visit friends in Georgia.
Their sons took their judo gear with them so they could continue
training with their friends' son, a member of the Chattanooga Judo Club
in the neighbouring state of Tennessee.
The club invited them to take part in the Tennessee inter-state
championship, which attracts around 400 competitors each year.
Daniel, 14, Scottish boys' champion and a member of the Scotland
junior squad, threw off challengers from across America and Mexico to
lift gold in his weight group.
Brother Ben, 11, took the bronze, and Ross, nine, the silver in their
respective categories.
Stonehaven club coach Ian Guthrie said: ''The boys were up against
some good competition, and performed really well.
''Daniel was commended by the judges for his performance. He won all
of his fights with perfect scores,'' he added.

WESTERN were yesterday left to reflect on what might have been in the
Scottish Cup final, for while they were beaten 2-1 by Touche Ross
Gordonians, they certainly had the opportunites at least to level the
scores in the closing stages if not win the game itself.
The pendulum appeared to have swung in their favour 10 minutes from
time. David Benson was fouled in the process of shooting for goal but
unfortunately for them, Steve Menzies hit a post with the resulting
penalty.
Worse was to follow for the Glasgow side five minutes later. Roddy
Philp, their captain, took a pass from Neil Menzies but
uncharacteristically the Scotland international shot past when it looked
easier to score.
Touche Ross, very much the underdogs, responded positively and did
well to keep the Western forces at bay. The teams were level at that
point with Western's Murray Laing cancelling out a score six minutes
earlier in the twentieth minute through Richard Freeland by converting a
penalty corner.
Then, three minutes after half-time, came the moment for which this
final will long be remembered. Jimmy Wright, Touche Ross's 18-year-old
winger, took a pass from Andrew Milne, his captain, burst through on the
right flank and with a brilliant drive left Gary Thomson, the Western
goalkeeper, glued to the spot.
This goal was a fitting climax to a memorable weekend for the Aberdeen
club, for on Saturday they laid the foundation for the treble by winning
the reserve and district cup to emulate Kelburne's feat in 1992.
Results:
Saturday: Reserve Cup Final -- Gordonians 3, Kelburne 2. District Cup

TWO policemen suffered stab wounds as they tried to break up scuffles
between Roma and Lazio fans at the Olympic Stadium yesterday as an
unprecedented appeal by Pope John Paul for peace was ignored.
Both were taken to hospital after disarming one fighting fan after the
match which Lazio won 2-0.
Roma captain captain Giuseppe Giannini was another who ignored the
Pope's plea by getting himself sent off in the 80th minute for a vicious
tackle on Roberto Rambaudi.
England's Paul Gascoigne, who recently returned to action after a year
on the sidelines with a broken leg, played as a substitute from the 76th
minute.
Juventus' hopes of winning their first league title since 1986
suffered a setback when they lost 1-0 at home to lowly Padova.
Dutch striker Michel Kreek scored the only goal to give Juventus their
fifth defeat of the season. It also allowed second-placed Parma to keep
alive their fading championship hopes with a 3-0 victory over Inter
Milan.
Parma now have 53 points from 28 games, eight behind Juventus.
Two second-half goals from the Argentinian midfielder Nestor Sensini
and a free-kick from Gianfranco Zola allowed Parma to bring Inter's
eight-match unbeaten run to a halt.
Sampdoria, beaten in the Cup Winners' Cup semi-final by Arsenal in
midweek, again let a two-goal advantage slip in a 2-2 draw against
Fiorentina.
Ruud Gullit scored twice before late efforts from Argentine Gabriel
Batistuta and Francesco Baiano gave the visitors a point.

COMMONS Speaker Betty Boothroyd -- a former Tiller Girl -- had a
nautical wish come true yesterday when a speedboat took her racing
across the Thames in front of the Houses of Parliament.
Miss Boothroyd was given a run over the course of next month's London
Watersports Day, a festival of jet-ski, water-ski and powerboat racing
on the Thames in the heart of the capital.
She roared across it at 55mph yesterday morning and said: ''It
certainly blew the cobwebs away.''
The stretch of river, overlooked by Parliament, the Tate Gallery and
St Thomas's Hospital, is normally out of bounds to such craft, and Tory
MP Nicholas Winterton raised a question in the House after MPs overheard
a practice session last month.
But the Speaker, whose apartments in the Palace of Westminster have a
view of the river, told him: ''I thought it was a wonderful sight to see
the speedboats on the Thames and, in fact, I was rather envious. I
thought I should have been in one of them, but not on the skis!''
Organisers of the May 14 event, which will close the river to other
traffic for a day, were happy to oblige.

As the issue of boardroom pay is raised again, Herald writers consider
executive awards and how these increases have been funded.
COMPANY directors in Scotland are the highest paid in Britain earning
around #95,000 a year, according to a survey published today.
Managers in Scotland are also among the highest paid with average
annual salaries of #38,000, which is only surpassed by their
counterparts in inner London, who can expect an average of #43,000.
The joint survey, by the Institute of Management and the consultancy
Remuneration Economics, also found that women are still poorly
represented at executive level.
According to the study, the directors of large companies fared well in
1994, enjoying a 7% salary increase, and taking home, on average,
bonuses of around #11,000.
The average manager conformed to the stereotype, being male, in his
mid-forties and probably driving a company car. The average director was
described as in his late-forties, earning twice as much as those in
middle-management and had been with his organisation for around 15
years.
Managers and directors in the banking, finance, and insurance sectors
did better than their counterparts in the engineering and manufacturing
sectors.
Mr Peter Stevens of Remuneration Econonics, said that Scotland had a
proportionately higher number of financial organisations and
consequently higher salaries.
The survey found that the number of female managers rose slightly last
year from just below 10% to just more than 10%, while the number of
women directors rose to 3%, heralded as a new peak.
However, when it came to salaries, female directors earned on average
#30,000 less than their male colleagues, while female managers were paid
around #5000 less.
Those women who did make it to the top did so in areas such as
marketing and personnel. Women were thin on the ground in research and
development, manufacturing, and production.
Yesterday, Mr Stevens said that most organisations have been slow to
promote women. ''Women are generally younger then their male
counterparts and have been with their organisations for a shorter period
of time. Large organisations are very slow to react to change and it
will take a long time for women to get to the top.''
A second study shows that greed in the boardroom is trickling down the
company hierarchy and raising pay for business executives, writes
Christopher Sims.
Executive pay awards have risen by an averaged 6% in the past six
months, the highest increase for two years, according to a survey by pay
and benefits consultant Sedgwick Noble Lowndes.
''Our statistics support the view that the upturn in the average award
is the result of noticeably higher pay increases to a significant
minority, rather than a marked improvement for the vast majority of
executives,'' said Mr Andy Christie, a spokesman for Sedgwick Noble.
Among the findings are that while more than one quarter saw their pay
rise by between 5% and 10%, nearly half had rises of at or below the
rate of inflation.
Senior executives in larger companies have done the best, with an
average award of 7.1%. Executive performance-related bonuses are also
sharply up, reflecting the general recovery in profits as recession has
eased.
The average increase was 17% to #12,109. Chief executives enjoyed a
24% increase to almost #30,000, in addition to their average base pay of
#105,000.

Airdrie 1, St Mirren 0
AIRDRIE kept up their fight on two fronts at the weekend when a
last-gasp goal from 21-year-old substitute Jim McIntyre gave them an
undeserved victory over St Mirren in the wind tunnel that was Broadwood.
The three points keep Alex MacDonald's men in touch with the first
division leaders and in with a chance of promotion, but the home
performance was unconvincing, and St Mirren, still battling against
relegation, can feel they were hard done by, especially as they made the
better chances only to see veteran goalkeeper John Martin in unbeatable
form. No wonder he walked off with the man-of-the-match award.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns, whose side faces Airdrie in the Tennents
Scottish Cup final at Hampden next month, took the chance to size up the
opposition, but will have learned very little, except that, like every
other club, the Diamonds can have an off day.
Afterwards, MacDonald asked: ''What is it about football? You get up
in the morning feeling nice and happy, then five minutes into the match,
you become a maniac.
''Obviously, I'm delighted at getting three points, for it sets us up
nicely for next week's match at Dunfermline, but I really feel for the
St Mirren lads.
''They will be so disappointed, because it's not a nice feeling to
lose a match in the last minute.''
MacDonald's views were echoed by goalscorer McIntyre and keeper
Martin, who both admitted: ''I think you could say we stole it.''
The MacDonald humour, however, is never far below the surface. As he
passed the press corps, who were waiting to interview his players, he
said: ''Good night, gentlemen -- I hope you get more out of them than I
did.''
At this stage, results are all that should really matter for Airdrie,
and they must be given credit for battling right to the end when
McIntyre rose to head in a cross from Paul Harvey. The youngster then
heard the stadium announcer tell us all that the scorer was Andy Smith.
''I gave him a sharp look,'' said McIntyre. ''After all, I don't often
get a chance in the first team, and it was my first goal of the season.
It was a great cross from Paul and it came off my head on to my shoulder
before it went in. I suppose you could say it was a 1-2.''
McIntyre was brought from Bristol City last season, but has not
started a match for Airdrie this season, making just 12 appearances as a
substitute. ''I didn't expect to get a game today,'' he said. ''I was
delighted to be involved and to score was a bonus. If we hadn't got the
three points I think our chances of promotion would have gone.
''Our first aim has to be a place in the premier division, but
everyone also wants to be involved in the cup and I'm no different. With
my contract also up in June I also have to convince the manager I'm
worth a new one. When I was at Bristol, I didn't really get much of a
chance and the manager Russell Osman didn't fancy me. Mind you, the
strikers at that time were Andy Cole and Darius Dziekanowski and I
wasn't likely to get a game in front of either of them.''
St Mirren, who should have been a couple of goals ahead by the
interval, are just four points clear of second-bottom Ayr United, and
now have the added worry of an injury to goalkeeper Campbell Money, who
had to be replaced by Alan Combe at half-time, because of an arm injury.
Money had X-rays on Saturday night and said yesterday: ''There is no
break, but there is a possible muscle tear. I'll know the full extent of
the injury tomorrow after seeing a consultant, but it certainly feels a
good bit easier.
''We really should have taken something from the match, but we have
nobody but ourselves to blame. You must score when you're on top during
a match and we blew all our chances. We have three games left, against
Dundee, Clydebank, and Ayr, and we must win one of them.''

THE newly-developed Scotstoun Sports Ground in Glasgow's west end is
to become a centre of excellence for rugby.
Games against Western Province, New South Wales, and King Country will
be staged there next season and it will be the venue for a future
Glasgow Sevens tournament which it is hoped will rival the Melrose
tournament.
Glasgow Sevens also will try to entice the world's best exponents of
the short game to the city.
An attempt is also being made to bring a international tournament to
Glasgow, similar to the one in which the Scotland Under-19 team took
part earlier this month.
Bernard Connolly, director of Parks and Recreation with Glasgow
District Council, said: ''The whole of the council is enthusiastic about
rugby. We saw with the South African game at GHK how important it is.
There will be a major commitment to the game and the SRU president Ken
Smith and his officials are very keen.
''Work on the centre will start soon. Already we have major sponsors
interested in the sevens. A large tournament would be very attractive to
the city.''
Gordon Ash, the treasurer for Glasgow rugby, says Scotstoun will
become the focus for the game in Glasgow.
''There is to be #6m spent on a new stand that will seat 8000, a
running track, a fully equipped scrummage area and a top quality pitch.
It will be a two-year programme with the full-size running track
constructed first.
''Under the new stands there will be an indoor scrummaging area and a
weight training room.''
The floodlights will be upgraded. Indeed, there will be two floodlit
areas, and a proposal has been put forward that the existing sports hall
should be converted to an equestrian centre so that it could be used all
year round.''
Connolly added: ''We hope to raise some money from the Lottery, the
Sports Council, the European Community and the SRU. We will be putting
down the building blocks for the future of rugby and athletics.
''Scotstoun will be the centre of rugby excellence in the West and we
will be meeting with Jim Telfer, the director of rugby, to progress
matters.''
Glasgow has already approved an application for Lottery money for the
venture.
Gordon Ash says Glasgow rugby's administrative centre will eventually
go to Scotstoun.
''It looks as though Ken McEwan and Shade Munro, the men responsible
for educating our youngsters in rugby, will base themselves there, and
that Glasgow rugby's HQ will be there, too.''
Not all Glasgow games will be staged at the new Centre of Excellence.
Ken Crighton, a member of the Glasgow committee, said: ''All of the
clubs have done well in hosting Glasgow games. We will keep doing that.
''There will be more Glasgow games. This is an exiting development and
I can confirm that various items of equipment, including scrummaging
machines, have already been bought. There is even, I believe, talk of
undersoil heating for the pitch.''
Gordon Ash added that funding for the project may be sought from rugby
supporters.
Jim Telfer, the SRU's director of rugby, said yesterday: ''I have been
kept informed of what was happening and obviously I am keen that this
centre of excellence dovetails with the one we have planned in
Edinburgh. We will be having discussions about that.''

BELGIAN captain Marc Degryse could be Celtic's next big-money signing.
The Glasgow club are believed to have started negotiations with the
player's club, Anderlecht, and hope to complete a #1.5m deal at the end
of the season.
I understand Celtic made efforts to sign Degryse before last month's
transfer deadline but Anderlecht decided they needed the player in their
bid to win the Belgian title.
Degryse said: ''I have spoken to Celtic. I know they are building a
team there and have great ambitions.
''Here at Anderlecht that kind of ambition is lacking. I have been
impressed by the Celtic outlook and it is possible that I shall join
them when the season here in Belgium is over.''
Degryse, 29, has won more than 50 caps for his country, scoring 20
goals.
Degryse plays just off the main striker with his club but I was told
from Belgium: ''He often plays a free role, similar to the one Brian
Laudrup has with Rangers.
''Many people here believe that is when he plays best, when he is
given freedom.''
Celtic, meanwhile, have not lost interest in Dimitri Radchenko, the
Russian striker who plays in Spain for Real Santander.
Radchenko told me in Moscow that his club were ready to sell him to
Celtic for a #2.2m fee and added: ''If everything is suitable I could be
playing in Scotland next season.''

THE Scottish Claymores performed a great escape to win their first
game in the World League in Germany, defeating Frankfurt Galaxy, 20-14.
Scottish chances looked down and out with just 59 seconds remaining,
when Claymores' quarterback Matt Blundin was almost sacked on a
third-down-and-18 play deep in Galaxy territory.
However, Blundin managed to evade four German pass rushers to lob a
pass to receiver Darrell Mitchell, who ran the ball over the Galaxy
line. Then on the next play, running back Siran Stacy dived in from two
yards to give the Scots victory and silence the 25,182 home fans.
But there was controversy when Galaxy head coach Ernie Stautner
claimed Blundin was ''in the grasp'' or tackled by his lineman on the
play when the quarterback sneaked the ball to Mitchell.
This followed another refereeing decision which denied the Germans a
touchdown, keeping the Claymores in the game 14-13 behind with 10
minutes remaining.
This was a crucial win for the Scots, who could not afford to drop to
a 0-3 record and now head coach Jim Criner is confident that his team
have at last turned their fortunes around.
''It's not just our first win,'' said Criner, ''it's a win on the
road, against a tough opponent in the fastest turnaround to a game I've
been involved in in 30 years of coaching.
''For our players to come back fighting and play the way we did is a
compliment to their character. It's also a tremendous compliment to our
coaching staff who have had to overcome a lot in the last month in
putting our game plan together.''
The defensive line unit set the tone for the rest of the team in the
first quarter, combining to sack Galaxy quarterback Jim Miller three
times. Running back Stacy got the Claymores off to a great start. But
they could have been 13 points ahead at the break if it were not for
disappointing misses from kicker, Arden Czyzewski.
Galaxy came out firing in the second half. German national player Ingo
Seibert capped the eight play drive blasting into the endzone from two
yards to tie the scores at 7-7.
The Claymores offence found it difficult to move the ball and indeed
gave it up when Stacy fumbled after having been hit at the German
13-yard line.
Then Bobby Olive beat James Williams in the endzone to catch a Paul
Justin pass to give the Germans a 14-7 lead with 10 minutes remaining.
Just when it looked as if all was lost the Germans were forced into a
mistake when the Claymores' defensive line pressured causing a fumbled
snap, and linebacker Brian Jones recovered the ball for the Claymores 10
yards from Galaxy's endzone.
Under pressure, quarterback Blundin found receiver Tim Barnett in the
corner for the touchdown, but Czyzewski missed his kick.
The Scots defence came up with the big play once again, sacking Justin
on his 11-yard line, forcing the Germans to give up the ball, and with
less than a minute remaining, Blundin stayed cool and steered the
Claymores to victory.
In England, the London Monarchs were beaten 17-10 by Amsterdam
Admirals at White Hart Lane.
Just 8763 watched the game in which the Dutch side extended their 100%
record to three games. The attendance does not augur well for the
Monarchs, who were hoping for at least 15,000.

THE newly-developed Scotstoun Sports Ground in Glasgow's west end is
to become a centre of excellence for rugby.
Games against Western Province, New South Wales, and King Country will
be staged there next season and it will be the venue for a future
Glasgow Sevens tournament which it is hoped will rival the Melrose
tournament.
Glasgow Sevens also will try to entice the world's best exponents of
the short game to the city.
An attempt is also being made to bring a international tournament to
Glasgow, similar to the one in which the Scotland Under-19 team took
part earlier this month.
Bernard Connolly, director of Parks and Recreation with Glasgow
District Council, said: ''The whole of the council is enthusiastic about
rugby. We saw with the South African game at GHK how important it is.
There will be a major commitment to the game and the SRU president Ken
Smith and his officials are very keen.
''Work on the centre will start soon. Already we have major sponsors
interested in the sevens. A large tournament would be very attractive to
the city.''
Gordon Ash, the treasurer for Glasgow rugby, says Scotstoun will
become the focus for the game in Glasgow.
''There is to be #6m spent on a new stand that will seat 8000, a
running track, a fully equipped scrummage area and a top quality pitch.
It will be a two-year programme with the full-size running track
constructed first.
''Under the new stands there will be an indoor scrummaging area and a
weight training room.''
The floodlights will be upgraded. Indeed, there will be two floodlit
areas, and a proposal has been put forward that the existing sports hall
should be converted to an equestrian centre so that it could be used all
year round.''
Connolly added: ''We hope to raise some money from the Lottery, the
Sports Council, the European Community and the SRU. We will be putting
down the building blocks for the future of rugby and athletics.
''Scotstoun will be the centre of rugby excellence in the West and we
will be meeting with Jim Telfer, the director of rugby, to progress
matters.''
Glasgow has already approved an application for Lottery money for the
venture.
Gordon Ash says Glasgow rugby's administrative centre will eventually
go to Scotstoun.
''It looks as though Ken McEwan and Shade Munro, the men responsible
for educating our youngsters in rugby, will base themselves there, and
that Glasgow rugby's HQ will be there, too.''
Not all Glasgow games will be staged at the new Centre of Excellence.
Ken Crighton, a member of the Glasgow committee, said: ''All of the
clubs have done well in hosting Glasgow games. We will keep doing that.
''There will be more Glasgow games. This is an exiting development and
I can confirm that various items of equipment, including scrummaging
machines, have already been bought. There is even, I believe, talk of
undersoil heating for the pitch.''
Gordon Ash added that funding for the project may be sought from rugby
supporters.
Jim Telfer, the SRU's director of rugby, said yesterday: ''I have been
kept informed of what was happening and obviously I am keen that this
centre of excellence dovetails with the one we have planned in
Edinburgh. We will be having discussions about that.''

NOBODY came up with the numbers to win the #8.5m jackpot in the
National Lottery draw. That means the money is held over until next week
-- when organisers Camelot expects a top prize of around #17m. This
week's numbers were 8, 18, 20, 33, 36 and 38. The bonus number was 46.

BELGIAN captain Marc Degryse could be Celtic's next big-money signing.
The Glasgow club are believed to have started negotiations with the
player's club, Anderlecht, and hope to complete a #1.5m deal at the end
of the season.
I understand Celtic made efforts to sign Degryse before last month's
transfer deadline but Anderlecht decided they needed the player in their
bid to win the Belgian title.
Degryse said: ''I have spoken to Celtic. I know they are building a
team there and have great ambitions.
''Here at Anderlecht that kind of ambition is lacking. I have been
impressed by the Celtic outlook and it is possible that I shall join
them when the season here in Belgium is over.''
Degryse, 29, has won more than 50 caps for his country, scoring 20
goals.
Degryse plays just off the main striker with his club but I was told
from Belgium: ''He often plays a free role, similar to the one Brian
Laudrup has with Rangers.
''Many people here believe that is when he plays best, when he is
given freedom.''

We've been here 20 years and we face the next 20 without the prospect
of handing over to our children, as my father did with me, the physical
and mental aspects of this life which become even more daunting.
SUNLIGHT is buffing John Scott's demanding landscape into something
magnificent, velveting the cropped grass heights so that outbursts of
gorse seem pinned to them like gaudy brooches. These are the days when a
hill farmer may gaze across his tyrannous acres and begrudge no-one.
From every angle, in the sunlight, the outlook is superb.
But the language of delight cannot hide reality. On reaching one of
the loftiest points of Balkissock Farm, straddling the hills just beyond
Ballantrae in Ayrshire, you look down on the voluptuous grandeur of
Dunnack Valley where ScottishPower intends to trespass. Here on John
Scott's property they would plant 11 pylons, a chain of industrial
scarecrows obviously diminishing the value of his land. ScottishPower
itself concedes that this would be a significant visual intrusion. And
its compensation to him for such impudent occupation? A mere #213.
Even Mr Scott, a benign, reflective man, cannot disguise his anger at
the insult of that sum, and it goes without saying he is an activist in
the lengthy and expensive business of protesting.
The fact is these days, whatever the weather, much of a Scottish hill
farmer's life seems whipped by cold, black winds from every quarter.
Essential subsidies aside, the only money earned by actual toil on
terrain officially designated a less favoured area is also derisory:
last year the net income of such outposts fell by 24%, leaving an
average total profit of #8400.
''Many are earning far less than that,'' says Mr Scott, ''but from
that sum a hill farmer will have to live and re-invest as well as
support his wife and children and perhaps an older generation. And for
much of the year he will work seven days a week.''
A dead lamb will represent a loss of about #25. A sheep sold may make
#40, #60 at the very most.
Mr Scott is 43 and, although farming was not his initial career choice
(he graduated from Edinburgh University in civil engineering), there is
no doubt he loves the fields which he has inherited from his father.
Farming, first at Barrhill nearby, has been in the family for
generations, but he and his wife, Charity, actively discourage their own
two teenagers from making it their vocation.
''We've been here 20 years and we face the next 20 without the
prospect of handing over to our children, as my father did with me, the
physical and mental aspects of this life which become even more
daunting.''
Skimming up and over the land, rising from 300ft to 1300ft, Mr Scott
now herds his sheep by motorbike, like an agile contestant in some
cross-country rally. But as an apprentice shepherd, he would walk 20
miles a day, seven days a week -- a foolproof way, he says, to acquire
arthritic hips.
Since the Old Testament, of course, the whingeing farmer has been a
cliche, but in the case of those struggling against the all or nothing
promise of hostile land any stereotype branding doesn't make the
anxieties less valid.
Mr Scott supplements his own earnings from tending his 1600 acres with
a total of 1200 ewes and 90 cows by working as a part-time fertiliser
salesman, while Mrs Scott operates a small and largely seasonal catering
service called Doorstep Dishes.
Mr Scott believes hill farming, especially in the Highlands, is on a
knife-edge. Yet without this endeavour, a damaging chunk of civilisation
is dislodged. For, by working the land and conserving habitats, by
whitewashing cottages and sheds, securing dykes, and hanging B&amp;B signs
on the gates, by all this ancient husbanding, the good hill farmer
becomes intrinsic to Scotland's modern tourism. He is the real caretaker
of the environment.
However, there is more to it than that. Despite his remoteness, the
hill farmer exists as a vital strand in urban life, the means of its
sustenance and one more reason for its employment. A recent study of the
Grampian region indicates that for every 10 jobs swept away by
agricultural decline, a further 13 are lost in support industries. All
or nothing, boom or bust. Such has always been the fate of those tied to
the earth's umbilical cord.
Now, in the 60 days of the lambing season, the vigiliance and tending
are unremitting with every available hand drawn into the hill farm's
time of harvest.
And in a livelihood where suicide is twice the national rate, the
level of stress mocks the very notion of rural lyricism. Tax fears,
alcoholism, loneliness, a stern eternity of work for the gift of a shaky
future, and a climate chucking the rain of depression at everything for
most of the year . . . these are the demons which counselling therapists
seek to alleviate in country communities today.
But while modern Scotland may have developed beyond recognition, rural
Scotland has rarely altered over generations, and in many instances the
counsellors strive against a raging silence, final as a rock. It remains
part of a small farmer's burden to know the price of everything and note
down the bleak truth in glaring pounds and pence.
Now, adding to the hazards, there is the rise of Direct Action against
the farmer by the fellow citizens he works to feed. Like many, Mr Scott
believes his profession is the victim of clever misinformation peddled
by a militant vegetarian lobby with its own business profits agenda.
''As it happens, I believe 97% of the British public want meat, need
meat, and eat meat. If people are concerned about travelling conditions
for animals, then they should eat British because our standards in that
respect are better than anyone's. In fact, our animals travel to Europe
by a more humane means than most commuters experience in the London tube
during the rush hour.''
These explosions of outrage against farmers, he says, happen only in
times of plenty, but he does believe there must be more liaising with
environmental bodies.
''I was in Coventry two days after Jill Phipps was killed, and I have
a deal of sympathy with the protesters, but in this case they have been
largely mislead. Our livestock is produced to the highest welfare
standards in the world.'' He also reflects that if British industry had
been as efficient as British farming in the past twenty years then in,
his view, we would be as rich as Japan.
But if, as a result of all the demonstrations, animal welfare does
improve throughout the European Union, then Mr Scott agrees it will be
well and good. ''However, much more research should be done into what
actually makes animals contented. A calf is an animal that likes to have
a lot of milk in one feed. Then it lies down for maybe 15 hours behind a
bush, perfectly at ease. It may take half a day for you to find it
again, but it will have come to no harm and be quite content. Now the
welfarers are telling us a calf on a journey must be watered and fed
every few hours. What they don't understand is that disturbing the
creature in such a way actually induces distress. The welfarers are
forgetting that what beasts endure in nature makes them quite tough.''
Unexpectedly, Mr Scott also disputes the view that sentimentality is
meddlesome. He has a colleague, not far away, who is committed to
raising happy pigs and provides them with toys including coloured balls
and showers. ''I myself find it very difficult to send my livestock off
to market. A caring farmer does grow fond of his animals. He detects
their different characters, and, given the constraints of the weather,
he tries to make their lives as enjoyable as possible.
''I go around my sheep four times a day to check their needs and
wants. And if I lose a lamb for any reason I do feel guilty to some
extent, but hill sheep are very hardy which again is why so much of the
present protest is wrong.''
The natural habitat of Mr Scott's Blackfaces are the Scottish
mountains where at least 21 climbers have been killed this year alone.
''These sheep can live there all year round, surviving where humans may
perish.''
Hill-farming convener for the Scottish National Farmers' Union and
president of the Ayr NFU, as well as chairman of one of the Union's
national sub-committees, Mr Scott also sees other enemies afoot: those
bankers and academics who undermine the EU's recent Common Agricultural
Policy reforms. They are, he says, no friends of rural Scotland.
''I would ask them to think again because -- with present income
levels -- the results of their actions would mean wanton destruction.''
Despite his Edinburgh degree, Mr Scott has never worked as an
engineer. Before he could set forth in that direction, the ill health of
his father summoned him home to Balkissock. But where the farm once
supported three full-time employees there is now only one plus a
part-time worker. For the past three years he has also rented 170 acres
at Balig, a low-ground coastal farm with its own stock, but also used
for lambs which cannot be finished on the high land at home.
He doesn't regret not being an engineer. Like the best of his kind, he
lives and works so that his stock may survive decently and profitably,
and that his fields may stay fertile beyond his time.
''I believe very strongly that it is important to improve your lot, to
respect the land and leave it in better order than you found it.'' And,
for all its hardships and uncertainties, the dawn vigils by a strugging
lamb, the untameable vengeance of the weather, a good shepherd still
regards it as a privilege to feed a hungry world.
As for the rest of us, the land remains the ancient source from which
all cultures rise. We stop our cars, and scramble over dykes to touch
the grass, and feel renewed. This, for a moment, is life free of the
city's halter. And then, not fit enough for broken-backed endeavour, we
turn around and grip the steering wheel again.

A SCOTS MP will warn Armed Forces Minister Lord Henley today of what
he believes is ''a Lockerbie-type disaster just waiting to happen''.
Labour's George Foulkes has already phoned a protest to the Minister's
office after a sudden increase in low flying by military planes in the
approaches to Prestwick Airport.
Last night the Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley MP said: ''On Friday
morning my phone was red hot with people from Cumnock, Auchinleck and
Catrine complaining about the sudden and huge increase in low flying
over areas where there has not been low flying in the past.
''In all my time in Westminster I have never had so many people
protesting.''
The MP explained: ''The problem is occurring because the Civil
Aviation Authority took the appalling decision to lift the exclusion
zone for low flying on the flight path into Prestwick . . . on the basis
that the airport was in decline. That certainly is not the case now.''
Mr Foulkes said: ''Everyone is worried about the danger of a mid-air
collision. They feel it is a tragedy waiting to happen -- and I have to
agree with them.''
He will remind Lord Henley of a pledge given two years ago that the
Borders low flying area would have a decrease of 30% in training
flights.
He added: ''It seems some people in London don't understand that this
is a pretty densely populated area.''
The MP will seek a meeting with the CAA to ask them to reverse their
decision on the Prestwick exclusion zone.
He said: ''I know that Matthew Hudson, of Prestwick Airport, is very
unhappy about the situation and I know that he has already expressed his
deep concern about it.''

THERE'S something odd going on at Perth where director Richard Baron
has managed to make this pretty much forgotten post-war English comedy
considerably funnier than he did Oscar Wilde's Importance of Being
Earnest a couple of months ago.
The name of John Dighton does not loom large in the history of British
playwriting, even if his 1948 public school romp did help establish the
career of Margaret Rutherford and enjoyed lasting success on film with
Joyce Grenfell and Alistair Sim.
I won't pretend to have rushed with a sense of burgeoning excitement
to see a play the premise of which is that, because of a bureaucratic
error, a posh boys' school has been forced to share its premises with an
evacuated and equally posh girls' school. Even the traditionally
conservative Perth audience seemed a little shamefaced at turning out
for something so blatantly locked in a soft-centred timewarp.
Period piece it may be, but its over-riding quality is that it's
gloriously and uncomplicatedly funny. In its comedy of cock-up,
confusion and cover-up it is not a million miles away from the more
manic moments of Fawlty Towers and, although it loses ground after its
second-act crescendo, it has more than enough witty lines, knockabout
characters and comic plotting to sustain it to the end.
Baron's production is tight and direct, rich in comic detail (even the
ushers are in school uniform) and never lingering long enough to remind
us of the irrelevance of it all.
And it bubbles over with great performances, notably Victoria
Hardcastle playing the headmistress with broad-hipped swagger, and
Angela Lund who, as the spiffing Miss Gossage, turns lankiness into an
art form.

<HEADLINE>Way Forward group and Euro-rebels set to stymie Cabinet plans for national scheme. Right musters against identity cards</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978731208</RECORDNO>

GOVERNMENT plans for a national identity-card scheme suffered a severe
setback today as the Tory right joined Euro-rebels in a public campaign
of defiance.
The influential Conservative Way Forward group warned Ministers they
would be making a ''serious mistake'' if they attempted to push through
the identity-card scheme.
Rebel MPs, kicked out of the parliamentary Tory party in a row over
Europe, have already signalled their willingness to fight the
introduction of ID cards on the grounds that it would increase pressure
from Brussels to scrap border controls.
But the threat from the right to oppose a scheme for a national ID
card will be regarded as far more serious by Ministers.
It places in jeopardy any chance the Government, already in a
technical Commons minority because of the expelled rebels, might have
had to force the measure through.
The Government claims that a Green Paper, due to be published in the
next few weeks, will outline options but there will be no ministerial
preference expressed.
But Downing Street sources have made it clear that the Cabinet has
moved behind the idea of some form of card being brought in -- if only
on a limited or voluntary basis.
A Conservative Way Forward discussion document warned: ''ID cards may
seem like a harmless mechanism for helping the police, but their
introduction will be hard fought.
''The Government will be making a serious mistake if it ignores
warnings such as this and seeks to push ahead with an identity-card
scheme.''
Conservative Way Forward chairman Lord Parkinson, a close confidante
of Baroness Thatcher during her premiership, said no action should be
taken in advance of a thorough public debate.
''The introduction of identity cards would be a very major step and
would have serious implications for the traditional liberties of the
British people,'' he said.
The document argued that ID cards would fundamentally alter the
relationship between the ordinary citizen and the state by potentially
requiring an individual to justify his or her presence in any place at
any time.
It said there was no conclusive evidence that compulsory ID cards
would cut crime, and voluntary cards -- the likely first step to a
compulsory scheme -- would never be carried by criminals.
''Unlike the rest of Europe, or the USA, our unwritten constitution
gives us no list of protected rights,'' the paper said.
''We are free to do or say what we like so long as we do not commit a
criminal offence or breach the rights of others.
''We can be challenged by no-one to identify or explain ourselves
unless an offence has been committed. Identity cards could alter the
balance of our constitution and bring into question the need for more
fundamental constitutional reform.''
New ''smart card'' technology could mean a huge amount of information
being stored on cards to which ordinary people had little or no access
but which could be accessed by any number of agencies.
The CWF urged the Government to oppose any moves to a Europe-wide ID
card and to resist the temptation to bring in a national scheme ''by
stealth'' through voluntary cards.
Home Secretary Michael Howard dismissed newspaper reports that the
Government had decided that all motorists and benefit claimants would be
forced to carry ID cards.
''It has been known for some time that the Government intends to
publish a wide-ranging consultation paper on the introduction of a
national identity-card scheme,'' he said.
''The document will set out the implications of all the various
options. The Government is not committed to any particular option in
advance of the consultation document.
''The Government welcomes all contributions to the national debate on
this important issue.''

Christopher Portway makes tracks with the buffs
NEARLY 30 years ago, when its existence was threatened by closure, it
did not seem as though the main railway line from Inverness to Wick and
Thurso would survive its centenary. It was on July 28, 1874, that the
final section of the line from Helmsdale northwards was opened for
traffic, and, today the most northerly rail route in Britain is still
going strong. But for how long? Again the closure threat lies heavy in
the air.
The main line to northern Britain ends at Inverness. Thereafter all
lines including those due north of Glasgow except that to Inverness
could be described as branch lines. But what these lack in traffic
density they make up in scenic splendour and historical allure.
A national holiday was declared in Inverness that day in 1860 when the
first turf for the northbound railway line to Wick was cut. In July 1874
the task was completed though a deficiency of funds had to be made up by
the Duke of Sutherland. The distance between Inverness and Wick -- where
a line linking it to Thurso on the north coast had already been
constructed.
At the Muir of Ord the railway skirts the rounded form of Ben Wyvis,
the highest summit in Easter Ross, and at Dingwall is the junction of
another famed line, that of the Kyle of Lochalsh.
At Fean the railway makes the first of its inland detours to skirt an
indented coast thus leading the trains due west to Tain, the ancient
Royal Burgh on the Dornoch Firth. Not until Lairg does the line begin to
revert to its northerly alignment and with Lairg we have a township that
is, virtually, the off-centre hub of the scattered communities of
Sutherland.
At Helmsdale the track turns inland again to skirt the high land of
the Ord of Caithness and enter the Strath of Kildonan, the scene of
Scotland's Klondyke-type gold rush in 1868. Abruptly one obtains a
foretaste of the evocative loneliness of Britain's northernmost
counties, here rich in prehistoric remains.
Such a journey on the Far North Line is a fascinating experience for
the casual traveller -- providing time is not the essence -- as well as
for the railway buff. Although the route lacks the dramatic splendour of
the neighbouring Kyle line, it has its own unique character stemming
from the variety of the landscape it crosses and from the fact that it
takes one almost to John O'Groats itself.
And it is to the Kyle Line that we come next. Again this starts from
Inverness and, oft-threatened with closure, is a treausre of our
island's heritage. Since 1870 trains have traversed the Highlands
between the Cromarty Firth and the Atlantic waters of Loch Carron, but
establishing this 82 miles of railway was no easy task.
The original intention was to drive it all the way to the Kyle of
Lochalsh but, once more, the money ran out -- and there was no
benefactor here to step in with the wherewithal. But when the West
Highland Railway Company decided to extend its line from Fort William to
Mallaig, only a short sail from Skye, a crisis of competition arose.
Somehow the finance was found and Victorian engineers blasted and hewed
their way through uncompromising rock -- sometimes to a depth of nearly
90ft -- to Kyle.
Whether you are a railway enthusiast or not the journey becomes a
worthy excursion. Strathpeffer, ahead of the Dingwall junction with the
northbound railway, was once a fashionable spa where local gentry
refused permission for the tracks to cross their estates. So a costly
and difficult detour had to be made and Strathpeffer paid the price by
obscurity.
The 164-mile line between Glasgow and Mallaig, with a spur to Oban
from the junction at Crianlarich, is known as the West Highland Line.
Twenty miles out and the countryside takes on a grander look as the
train enters the West Highlands proper with, across Loch Lomond, the
hills once roamed by Roy Roy, legendary warrior, robber and
folklore-hero.
At Crianlarich the line is beset by mountains; Ben More, Ben Oss, Ben
Dhu Craig and Ben Lui while, beyond Tyndru, it crosses the great
watershed where the rivers flow to the Atlantic instead of to the North
Sea. The famous horseshow bend and its double viaducts come next with
more peaks soaring in the east, and at Rannoch Moor, a 20-mile by
20-mile desolation of peat bogs, tarns, streams and tiny lochs,
brushwood, earth and ashes.
The highest point of the line -- 1350ft -- is attained at Corrour
where the only snow-shed in Britain protects the trains from winter
snow-drifting and at Tulloch the line changes direction from north to
west to follow the gradually broadening valley to Fort William and Loch
Linnhe.

WITH Holliger conducting Honegger, the SCO's weekend concerts in
Edinburgh and St Andrews were a search for the elusive flavour of
Switzerland. Why Heinz Holliger, the world's most famous oboist, was
appearing exclusively as conductor seemed in itself mysteriously Swiss,
but was surely prompted by the fact that Honegger wrote no oboe
concerto.
At any rate he obtained a beautifully fresh, clear account of his
compatriot's Fourth Symphony, an affectionate portrait of the city of
Basle and a tribute to the founder of the Basle Chamber Orchestra, the
great Paul Sacher.
Evoking cathedral bells, the music -- dating from 1946 -- celebrated
the end of the Second World War, a subject of which Honegger (who lived
in Paris) had first-hand knowledge. But though a feeling of freedom blew
through the score, it all sounded characteristically ambivalent, a
mixture of the pastoral and the sinister, vividly conveyed in the
stalking rhythms of the slow movement.
Honegger was the perpetual pessimist of Les Six, the group of
composers who in the 1920s sought to bring wit and lucidity to music in
France. His early cello concerto, in Boris Pergamenschikow's poised
performance, showed that even he could write that way before the darker
side of his pesonality overcame him.
Two rarely-played cello pieces by Dvorak contributed to the
programme's general air of freshness, as did an ebullient, rather
eccentric performance of Haydn's London symphony, in which Holliger's
reseating of the violins in their classical positions to left and right
of the podium threw their interplay into relief. With an oboist as
conductor, however, it was the woodwind who emerged as the winners.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie visits an island that is a botanists' paradise
FROM the rocky thumb of Cap Corse in the north-east, to the chalk
white cliffs of Bonifacio at the southern tip, the Mediterranean island
of Corsica is a land of limitless variety. In the west, tall rocks
plunge into the sea, while in the east the mountains smooth out into
long beaches, giving in all some 750 miles of fine sandy shores with
bays and coves.
The centre of the uskabds holds the ''maquis'', the eight-foot-high
thick vegetation that is Corsica's original covering. In the Second
World War, it gave its name to the French Resistance Movement because of
the way anything that enters it can disappear in a minute.
We were lucky enough to see a wild pig scurrying away into the maquis,
where hundreds still live, coming down occasionaly on to roads that
twist and turn up to the high peaks of the centre, some more than
80,000ft.
In winter, these mountains with tops under snow from November until
May, give excellent skiing. From April to June, mountains and valleys
are a thick carpet of wild flowers, which smell so beautiful that,
combined with the maquis, they say you can catch the scent of Corsica
long before the boat from Marseilles reaches Ajaccio. This magnificent
and distinctive flora brings in many botanists, and there are wild
mountain sheep, and unusual birds such as nuthatches, buzzards, eagles
and bearded vultures.
If time is not scarce, by sea is the best way to come to Corsica, as
peaceable invaders, unlike the waves of conquerors who for centuries
swept over all the Mediterranean islands from distant Tyre and Carthage
and other Mediterranean city-states. Romans arrived around 300BC, the
start of nearly a thousand years of Roman rule, with remains from the
period in the museum of Ajaccio's old Genoese fort.
The Pisans built many of the best churches after the island became
part of the eleventh-century Pisan diocese, but the Genoese were the
ones who left the strongest mark on the island. Between the sixteenth
and early eighteenth centuries, they built great citadels such as Calvi
and Bonifacio, and also ringed the island with watchtowers.
At the end of the last century, Corsica was a favourite holiday stop
for British colonial families on the way to and from duties in the
distant parts of the Empire. Not many traces of this period remain but
the National School of Music and Dance in Ajaccio was once an Anglican
church.
Corsica's capital, the old seaport of Ajaccio, stands on one of
Europe's most magnificent bays. Facing south-west, it leads to Les Isles
Sanguinaires, so called because the sky turns blood red behind their
cone shapes at sunset. To watch it, we followed a rocky path near the
western point leading to one of the 100-or-so defence towers that line
the coast. Built by the Genoese, their signal fires could send a message
round the 100x50-mile island in one hour -- considerably faster, so
locals say cynically, than the island's telephone service today.
Another favourite place where we liked to linger during that
marvellous sunset, was one of the outside cafes along La Route des
Sanguinaires, very good for hotels and restaurants, none of them very
far from the beach.
Though the city may be Genoese in origin, Ajaccio is very French, with
good restaurants and bistros, which serve Corsican food. Fish and
shellfish are good everywhere, with exotics such as wild boar, game
includes woodcock and partridge. Figatelli is a black smoked pork
sausage and, though I could not myself face suckling pig, the typical
Omelette Broccio, which includes a special Corsican cheese, was
excellent, especially when it follows a glass of Cap Corse, a local
aperitif, rather like a Martini.
Anywhere in Corsica, two names soon come to the fore, the singer Tino
Rossi and the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte -- in that order. Every guide
points out Rossi's house built in the shape of a guitar, and Napoleon's
birthplace in Ajaccio is a museum. His baptismal font is in the
sixteenth-century cathedral and two years before his baptism, so the
story goes, his mother went into labour while attending a cathedral
service.
North from Ajaccio is one of the wonders of Corsica, the Calanques of
Piano, a gorge with a mile of massive rocks and peaks weathered into
amazing shapes. As we walked through, it was easy to identify the names
in the guide book -- the petrified lovers, the eagle, the Indian squaw,
De Gaulle's nose, Churchill's cigar, lots of dragons and other items too
rude to name, all caused by acidity in the rain. With rock and asphodels
hanging over the shapes, the gorge is beautiful.
The central heights make Corsica ideal for energetic holidays, skiing
in winter, and mountain walking and pony-trekking in the summer, also
fishing in many upland streams. The coast lends itself to superb water
sports, and the island is a popular calling place for Mediterranean
sailors. Porto Vecchio in the south-east (note the Italian name) is a
favourite, a marvellous almost fjord-like inlet, five miles long, with
first-class harbour facilities. There are miles of beaches, but
Palombaggia is probably the best with water that, from above, seems
almost transparent.
From Ajaccio, the road south to Bonifacio and on to Sardinia winds
through mountains and along the coast to the town's wonderful Genoese
Citadel, some 180ft above sea level on white chalk cliffs. More than
2000 people go about their daily lives along the narrow streets and in
and out of the ancient buildings of this old fortress-town, a place for
walking, with 187 exhausting steps up from the harbour.

IF I lined up here the number of complaints thrown my way on Saturday
night following the performance of Miaskovsky's Cello Concerto by Truls
Mork and the Royal SNO, there would be no space for anything else. In
sum, they amounted to the fact that the work itself was a load of
rubbish.
True, a masterwork it is not. The irony is, however, that most of the
complainants were the very folk who spend a great deal of energy calling
out for music other than the endlessly reiterated core repertoire. They
must know, surely, that if a piece has never surfaced before, the
chances are that there's a very good reason for it: ie it's a lesser
piece.
You can't win, I guess a programme planner would say. Personally, I
have no problem with the odd curiosity or nonentity -- as with Gliere's
Horn Concerto earlier in the season -- if it gives us a glimpse of a
little-heard composer, and if it's well-played.
And Miaskovsky's rather sprawling and brooding concerto was
well-performed by the gentle giant, Truls Mork, who lavished upon it
some breathtakingly sensitive playing.
The rest of the night was plain sailing with Walter Weller in charge
of the closing concert of the winter season and luxuriously detailed
performances of Strauss's Die Frau ohne Schatten Fantasy and Ein
Heldenleben, the latter magnificently etched with Weller drawing out the
apotheosis (and sending the horns into orbit in the best passage ever
written for them) to glorious length.
Superbly characterful and flighty playing throughout by leader Edwin
Paling in the concerto-like solo part.

SUCCESS is no stranger to Aviall Caledonian Engine Services at
Prestwick. The 1995 Queen's Award for Export Achievement is the fourth
of its kind to come the company's way following similar successes in
1984, 1986 and 1990.
Export earnings, which account for a significant and still growing
proportion of turnover, are derived from the repair and overhaul of gas
turbine aero engines. Client airlines are from North and South America,
from Europe and the Middle and Far East, from China and North Africa,
and the Australian market is a current target for development.
Several recent contract successes have been announced in the past few
months, part of an impressive level of customer growth during the first
quarter of 1995.
''Through our on-going Project 35 activity and radical changes in the
company's organisational structure we have succeeded in increasing
overall efficiency, enabling us to meet the increasing demands of the
aggressive aviation market,'' said Stephen Henderson, managing director
of Aviall Caledonian.
One of the success stories is an exclusive six-year contract from
Monarch to service its Airbus A300-600, A320 and Boeing 737 fleets, a
total of 13 aircraft and 26 flying engines.
''It is a contract which reflects the growing business relationship
between both companies,'' said Stephen Henderson. ''Working closely with
Monarch over the years has enabled us to anticipate their requirements
and subsequently build in that extra service.''
Recent business growth, worth in excess of $30m a year, is regarded by
Aviall as contributing significantly towards their aim of achieving a
target 50% increase in business by 1996.
''This encouraging growth trend started early in 1994,'' said Stephen
Henderson. That was when many airlines embarked on major restructuring,
including out-sourcing for engine repair and overhaul.
''We are ideally placed to take advantage of this trend through our
business process re-engineering with shorter turntimes, competitive
pricing and, most important, focusing on customer needs.''
On the new customer front, Aviall Caledonian has won a six-year
contract to service engines from the Cyprus Airways fleet of Airbus
aircraft.
''Servicing Cyprus Airways aircraft means that we are exporting
Scottish engineering skills to yet another new market,'' said Stephen
Henderson.
Another new customer is Icelandair. Air Mauritius has also renewed an
exclusive contract for engine servicing covering another five-year
period.
An established and important factor in the Aviall Caledonian
portfolio, FedEx, has also signed a five-year contract with the
Prestwick company. Aviall Caledonian will service the engines of FedEx's
growing fleet of Airbus A310 aircraft. This combines with existing
agreements that cover engines for FedEx's DC10 fleets.
Aviall Caledonian's history goes back to 1978 when Sir Adam Thomson of
the then Caledonian Airways Group announced plans to open an aero engine
overhaul plant at Prestwick and Caledonian Airmotive was launched. A
construction and testing period followed and in July 1980 the Prestwick
site was officially opened by the Duke of Edinburgh. In 1980 the
workforce numbered around 90 and it was speculated that this could
increase to 250. There are now more than 800 employees.
Since the beginning the company has been active in marketing its
capabilities throughout the world and increasing the number of engine
types overhauled. Aviall Caledonian remains the only company outside the
USA to provide the overhaul of all types of CF6 engines.
By 1987, when it was acquired by Ryder System the US-based aviation
company, the Scottish company had become Europe's leading independent
aircraft engine repair facility. In November 1993 the company was
renamed Aviall Caledonian Engine Services.

A RECORD 140 Queen's Awards to British firms for export achievement,
announced in a special supplement to the London Gazette, is accompanied
by six awards for environmental achievement and 17 for technological
achievement.
The awards follow one of the highest-ever totals of applications for
consideration with more than 1700 firms seeking the right to declare
success.
Scottish firms feature in all three award categories, recipients
representing a wide spread of industrial and commercial activity
throughout the United Kingdom.
''These awards differ from personal honours,'' said a spokesman for
the Queen's Awards office. ''They are given to an industrial unit as a
whole, to management and employees working as a team.''
A successful firm is entitled to fly an Award flag and display the
emblem in different ways. The qualifications required for consideration
in each category are closely defined. The Queen's Award for Export
Achievement requires a substantial and sustained success in export
earnings to a level ''which is outstanding for the products or services
concerned and for the size of the applicant unit's operations''.
Eligible export earnings can include receipts for the export of goods
produced in this country, for services, merchant profits, royalties and
fees, and several forms of income.
The Queen's Award for Environmental Achievement requires a
''significant advance'' in the application of the development of
products, technology or processes. An award is only granted for
products, technology or processes which have achieved commercial
success.
Applicants must show the significance and difficulty of the
environmental problem concerned and the extent to which the cause is
addressed.
For the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement, a significant
advance leading to increased efficiency in the application of technology
is required.
''An essential factor recognised by the award is a practical
application to industry. An award is only made when there is evidence
that an innovation has achieved commercial success.''
Award presentations in all three categories will be made at formal
ceremonies during the summer and following months. Three representatives
of each firm will also be invited to a formal reception given by the
Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace.
The history of the awards scheme goes back almost 30 years to 1966
when the Queen's Award for Industry was instituted by royal warrant.
Replaced in the 1970s by separate awards for export and technology, that
was joined in 1992 by the new award for environmental achievement.
All three award categories are made with the assistance of an advisory
committee headed by Sir Robin Butler, the Cabinet Secretary. Other
members include Sir Peter Gregson, permanent secretary to the Department
of Trade and Industry, Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering
Council, Sir Derek Hornby, chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board,
Sir Bryan Nicholson, president of the CBI, and Jack Jones representing
the TUC.

FOR Motorola Ltd's European Cellular Subscriber Division, based at
Easter Inch, Bathgate, the Queen's Award for Export Achievement comes at
the end of three years which have seen the division grow from a
greenfield site to a manufacturing unit employing 2300 workers. When
combined with other Motorola branches at East Kilbride and South
Queensferry, the resultant total makes Motorola the largest employer in
Scottish manufacturing industry.
''The award is a real accolade, recognising outstanding team effort,''
said Mr Don Burns, senior vice-president and general manager. ''The
division is based on a 500,000 sq ft facility which is a #100m
investment.
''Almost all our current production is for export, going out to more
than 60 countries world-wide. That includes all of Europe, Africa and
the Middle East, China and Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and
Australia.''
Current Bathgate production includes what Motorola claims to be the
lightest and best-selling cellular telephones in the world, digitally
operated and using satellite links. Their Flare range, offering cellular
phones in 11 different colours, moves the cellular telephone into the
world of fashion accessories.

TWO years ago a group of Glasgow students, fed up with the
shortcomings of existing radio took to the air with a month of
transmitted anarchy. Anyone who could get their records along to the
studio or fancied letting rip over the airwaves could have a slot on
Sweet FM, the Glasgow-wide radio station broadcasting with a special
legal temporary licence issued by the newly deregulated Radio Authority.
It was pirate radio without the pain: and for a city in the throes of
a muffling club curfew it was chance to rave-up relatively uncensored.
John Dower, one of Sweet FM's surviving collaborators remembers. ''We
wanted to hear the sort of records we heard in the clubs, and music we
had in our collections.''
The local DJs who played on Sweet FM knew their audience inside out.
They'd get themselves and their punters vibed up for a night out at the
club. No-one got paid; dissemination of the music they loved and the
brief fame was enough. The station became the unofficial voice of an
ebullient club culture.
After a second broadcast last year, Sweet FM is now trying to shake
off the legacy of self-indulgent student radio and is putting together
another month's listening from today.
The aim is to secure a permanent, professional licence. Assuming that
the station would not be taken seriously in the cold world of legit
broadcasting if it continued with the student tag, the name checks now
go to sponsors rather than flat mates and the in jokes are most
definitely out.
''The market is there,'' says Dower, ''the fact that so many people go
to clubs in Glasgow proves it. Our justification for existing is that
we're regional, we're part of Glasgow. We're not Radio One, we're not
Pete Tong. You'll be able to hear local DJs.''
Getting serious, although potentially disastrous for such a free-form
organisation, shouldn't bruise the creative process. Live sets from
bands such as avant-garde techno meisters Global Communications have
been recorded for broadcast, unthinkable on Radio One or Clyde FM. It
may not be as ''street'' as pirate, but with legitimacy comes access to
bands such as Massive Attack and Orbital who have also been recorded for
broadcast.
It is more than probable that when the Scottish Metropolitan Licences
go up for grabs in 1996, a licence will not be awarded to Sweet FM but
instead go to a bland AOR (adult oriented rock) station as happened in
London with XFM losing out to Chrysalis's bid. In the meantime what we
have in Glasgow is a young, imaginative station that is actually fun to
listen to. Frequency 105.4, Sweet FM. Hook in while you can.

THE Queen's Award for Exports also comes to Polaroid (UK) Ltd at Vale
of Leven, Dumbarton, for the fourth time.
The UK company is a whollyowned subsidiary of the US Polaroid
Corporation in Massachusetts. The Vale of Leven plant was established in
1965, mainly as a film manufacturing operation but has now diversified
into cameras, industrial hardware including aspects of science, security
and medicine, and also sunglass lenses.
It now has some 1450 employees in Scotland and about 90% of what is
made at Vale of Leven is exported, going out to more than 100 countries.
Polaroid (UK) break this down as including 44% to Europe and 44% to the
US. Products are used in many ways, including national identity and
driving licence programmes, and film produced in Scotland was used in ID
programmes in Angola and Mozambique prior to elections.
The Scottish management point to three strategically vital factors
behind the plant's success -- manufacturing excellence, cost efficiency,
and the commitment and flexibility of the workforce. Over the past three
years, all Scottish employees have received training in employee
development, Total Quality Ownership, and where appropriate, leadership
skills.
Mike Fitzpatrick, the company's director of manufacturing and
development, said, ''The granting of the Queen's Award for Export is a
further major honour for us at Vale of Leven and a recognition of our
achievements over the past 30 years. Polaroid is a very busy and
exciting place at present.''
In its progress towards manufacturing excellence, Polaroid has focused
strongly on quality. Major efforts aimed at becoming increasingly
responsive to customers have included the development of close
relationships with Polaroid marketing subsidiaries world-wide.

IS the Royal Scottish Academy a club, a clique, a closed shop or a
good shop-window for a cross-section of Scottish art?
For the last 169 years artists have been submitting work to this,
Scotland's most prestigious annual show. For some it's hopeless; for
others the luck of the draw: right time, right selection panel.
Yet academicians and associates (who put the initials RSA and ARSA
after their name) have the privilege of seeing all their entries, as
many as six works, on the wall. Why? Surely academicians' work should be
good enough to stand the competition. If it deteriorates, as does
happen, it should be thrown out along with the rest.
The RSA has a long and illustrious history. It also has a firm
hierarchy, plus antiquated rituals, dinners, speeches, varnishing days,
gold chains and plumb-coloured cassocks designed by Noel Paton around
1900, and reminiscent of the Meister Singers.
The opening is thus an occasion for evening dress -- not something
everyone wants these days; and with scandalous arrogance, even the 16
prizewinners are excluded from the do. Oh dear. The RSA is not yet of
the twentieth, never mind the twenty-first,century.
So is it all sewn up, or can I detect a welcome breath of fresh air
seeping through the ancient corridors? David Mach was invited to show
his amazing and wonderful eight-foot high wire coathanger portrait bust
of Richard Jobson, as the the star exhibit.
The recent election of Glasgow Boy Adrian Wiszniewski to the rank of
ARSA, together with printmaker Alfons Bytautas and Aberdonian painter
Frank Convery is encouraging, and with folk like Ian McKenzie Smith as
secretary and Will Maclean and Barbara Rae newly on the council, things
are looking up.
Of course, if all the RSAs and ARSAs took advantage of their six-pack
ration, there would be no room left for anyone else. Luckily some, like
Joyce Cairns, who was on this year's hanging committee takes an
altruistic view: ''I reckon it's greedy to take up too much space. One
big picture and one small watercolour is enough.'' She practices what
she preaches, too.
Moreover, going by the 1995 winners, nowadays you don't have to have
an OAP bus pass to win a prize. Many winners, contrary to tradition, are
first-time exhibitors. Phil Braham aged 35, has won the prestigious
Guthrie Award for Three Trees, a luminous landscape suffused with a
melancholy glow, but resonant of some kind of resurrection. I also
admired his snowy Icarus painting, with its subtle tonalities.
At 24, Brendan Kelly wins the #1250 Macfarlane painting prize and
Kenny Hunter's superb neo-classical head of Athena, the Macfarlane
sculpture prize. (Both awards are sensibly geared to first-time
exhibitors to inveigle newcomers).
Other prizewinners include Christopher Kelly, Richard Murphy Simon
Laurie, Cathy Richmond, Stuart Fisher, Jim Ritchie and Anne Bevan. ''We
want as many young people to exhibit as possible,'' says Maclean. Thank
heaven for new blood.
There's still room for well kent folk. Bill Scott, the only
Academician to win anything, gets the Scottish Gallery Award for five
memorable whitewood totems carved and beautifully patinated, while Anda
Paterson's Portuguese Market Day hens, and Dorothy Stirling's sheep, get
the Hutchison prize for best animal images.
With commission at 25% (commercial galleries charge up to 50%) prices
should be low, but I'm afraid the famous Edinburgh hype is in operation
with many (Houston, Blackadder, Snowden, Churchill, McCulloch,
Cunningham) charging up to #20,000 -- and in a recession too.
However, price is no guide. Frances Pelly is a fabulous artist and you
can buy her Moon Mountain Pool for #450, while superb life drawings by
Butler and Snowden are a snip at #300.
Sculpture is good, and cheap. Outstanding pieces by Jake Harvey, who
works with seductive simple metal forms are #550, and the famous George
Wyllie's Good As Gold sandals #450. They bring a smile to the lips, as
does his impressive Blake's Bike.
Award-winner George Macpherson's understated grey poetry costs #350
and Chris Kelly's Bride &amp; Groom a mere #900. ''The shapes are taken from
cabinet makers manuals,'' he told me. ''I use lino with incised burnt
lines.''
Tweedie's Kelvingrove Fountain is #540, Neil's tempting Selkirk
Bannock #380 and Rodger's even more tempting Eve #60. Standen's
atmospheric Tristan and Isolde flying over the bridges costs #95, and
Duffind's Waking Hours #130. Bytautas puts his ambitious Orkney Anthem
at #360, while you can acquire a Tanera print from Will Maclean for just
#250.
But for lottery winners with price and space no object, try Sandy
Fraser's #5000 Cuckoo Coat -- an enigmatic oil depicting 11 figures,
four cocks (one human), two cats, one elephant and a skull in search of
an author.
Quite what is happening I don't know, but Fraser paints with such
consummate skill and conviction that I don't care. This visual riddle
does contain some ancient medical symbolism, for Fraser had just
finished a notable commissioned portrait of Dr Toft, president of the
Royal College of Physicians, which features similar imagery.
I also recommend Dawson Murray's lyrical Lotus Pool -- a bolder, more
abandoned version of his watery atmospherics, and perhaps the best thing
he's ever done; also Bet Low's Orkney panorama, with its palpable curve
of the earth; Earl Haig's structured landscapes and Brendan Kelly's
#7000 prizewinning pop group UV &amp; The Red Lights.
Kelly trained at the Slade and has twice been runner-up in the BP
National Portrait Gallery Awards. His oil reflects his fascination with
different forms of artificial and ultraviolet light. ''I was in a band,
so decided to paint musicians,'' he says.
The RSA has its downside. Too much is predictable with artists like
Mooney, Vettriano, Fullarton, Balmer, McClure, Leon Morrocco and
Morrison churning out the same old thing year after year, decade after
decade. Nothing's perfect -- but things do look set to change for the
better. See what you think.
* The RSA annual exhibition continues until July 8. Next Monday Clare
Henry reviews Triple Vision, an exhibition at Glasgow Print Studio as
part of Mayfest.

AN advertisement for recruits with Hydro Electric prompted a huge
influx of applications. The company had been looking for only 38 meter
readers, but 3000 hopefuls applied.
Personnel officers then had to search through the application forms to
find the staff needed to boost their workforce.
The new employees were required after the company decided to switch
from yearly to quarterly meter readings, in response to customer
demands.
Spokeswoman Mrs Linda Harper said yesterday: ''The huge response far
outweighed anything we have seen in the past. Just sifting through the
applications was a massive task, but we think it has brought us some
real quality employees.''
She added: ''I think we got so many applications because the adverts
asked for no particular skills and said full training would be given.''
The 38 new-starts will be paid #8200 a year plus bonuses for visiting
homes and businesses in their area.
Fifteen have been recruited in both Tayside and Grampian, with another
eight throughout the Highlands.
One of the select few picked was father of three Alan O'Conner, of
Schoolhill Terrace, Lossiemouth, Morayshire, who now works from Hydro's
Elgin office.
Mr O'Conner, 45, had no idea that he had beaten so many others to the
post, but he is delighted with his new job.
He said: ''I worked as a temporary meter reader for five months back
in 1987 and I liked the job then, so I decided to apply when I saw the
advert this time. I enjoy being out and about, and, within reason, you
can plan your own schedules.''
Mr O'Conner has had several jobs since leaving the RAF in the eighties
and had been unemployed since last September when he was made redundant
from his previous job, emptying Post Office mail boxes.

A wide range of companies have been successful in winning awards this
year, Bill Knox reports
THE 12 Scottish companies which have now joined the list of those
entitled to fly the Queen's Award flag for export achievement come in
sizes large and small and are widely scattered in terms of activity as
well as location.
Considered in alphabetical order, they are led by AT and T Global
Information Solutions (Scotland) Ltd in Dundee which designs and
manufactures automated teller machines and other self-service terminals.
Precursors of this large American-owned company have won export awards
on four previous occasions, the last in 1989. Exports have more than
doubled in the past three years and now go to more than 100 countries
throughout the world. Last year the company received in excess of 100
inward visits from financial institutions in more than 30 countries and
made in excess of 200 outward visits. A new product range and associated
software launched in 1991 has been a key element in the company's export
achievements.
Move to Falkirk and two companies, Carron Bathrooms Ltd and Carron
Phoenix Ltd, join the success list.
Carron Bathrooms Ltd began trading in 1982 and manufacture acrylic
baths, shower trays and sinks. They export to the European Union,
Eastern Europe, Scandinavia and the Mediterranean and previously won the
Queen's Award in 1993. The company conforms to, or improves on,
standards required by overseas markets. For example, products sold in
France are accredited with NF, the French standard.
Carron Phoenix Ltd, part of a privately owned Swiss multinational,
also began trading in 1982 and manufactures synthetic and stainless
steel sink tops. New export markets are being developed in Turkey, the
Middle East and Far East. Carron Phoenix is one of only four
manufacturers producing an extremely durable and attractive synthetic
material known as Granite.
''Some 60% of our current total product is exported,'' said Mr Roger
Clark, managing director of Carron Phoenix. ''We export to a total of 40
countries with the Middle East our fastest growth area. Our Granite sink
material, 70% granite rock and 30% acrylic resin, a very hard-wearing
material, is proving particularly attractive in markets throughout the
world.''
Carron Phoenix regard it as something of a record that their export
sales even include selling sink units to Taiwan.
''Our growth in size to our present 310 employees in a 19,000 sq m
plant, is due to a great extent to our export successes,'' said Roger
Clark. ''That drive for export success continues. This year, to date,
our staff have visited a dozen countries in search of new export
orders.''
The Chivas and Glenlivet Group at Paisley have had two of its
constituents, Chivas Brothers Ltd and Glenlivet Distillers as earlier
winners, but this is the first time that the group itself has won an
export award. The operating division of the Canadian-owned Seagram
Distillers Plc, it mainly exports Scotch whisky but also exports gin and
rum. Exports have increased by 70% during the last six years, sold
world-wide, representing more than 90% of total sales.
An example of the contrasting variety on the list of awards is Diamond
Power Speciality Ltd of Dumbarton. Established in 1913, and now a
subsidiary of McDermott International Inc of America, Diamond
manufactures cleaning systems for boilers and heat exchangers, exporting
to more than 40 overseas markets including Africa and the Indian
subcontinent.
It has developed a new export strategy focusing on markets of
perceived growth potential in the Far East, Western and Central Europe,
and the former Soviet Union to offset declining opportunities in
previous traditional markets and has achieved success in the developing
European market for pollution control equipment.
This is the first time that Diamond Power has received the Queens
Award, and managing director Allan Naismith said, ''We are delighted at
the news. It reflects on the excellent combined efforts of all of our
staff. Currently, export sales constitute some 87% of our total
activity.
''Much of our recent export growth has been in Europe, but there is a
current and strong new growth in the Far East, including two new orders
for cleaning equipment for power stations in Japan.''
Diamond Power first came to Dumbarton from Southampton in the 1960s
and today employs more than 130 people. Subsidiaries specialising in
pulp and paper plants cover Sweden and Finland.
Winning an award for the sixth time, Ethicon Ltd of Edinburgh is a
large manufacturer of surgical sutures and specialist wound repair
products and has shown an impressive and steady growth in exports since
the very start of the Queen's Awards scheme. A subsidiary of the US
company Johnson and Johnson, it was established in 1947 and now sells
world-wide to 110 countries outside of North America.
Motorola Ltd European Cellular Subscriber Division, located at
Bathgate and trading since 1985, is another well-known name on the list.
Manufacturing cellular telephones, it now exports to more than 60
countries world-wide.
A hi-tech medical company which quadrupled its exports in just three
years, Shield Diagnostics Ltd of Dundee began trading in 1987 and
manufactures in vitro medical diagnostic kits for auto-immune infectious
diseases, microbiology and cardio-vascular diseases.
The quadrupling of exports, between 1991 and 1994, represented two
thirds of total sales. Forty per cent of exports go to North America and
in Hungary a major success has been achieved with Shield Diagnostics
assisting in a programme of auto-immune assays involving its own
products.
New markets in the Pacific rim, India and North America are targets
for TRAK Microwave Ltd of Dundee, a small but busy subsidiary of the
Tech-Sym Corporation of America. TRAK manufactures a wide range of
ferrite microwave components and sub-systems used in the
telecommunications, aerospace, industrial and medical electronics
industries. They began trading in 1987.
The Scottish success among the six awards for Environmental
Achievement has been achieved by United Distillers Operations in
Edinburgh, sharing the award with United Glass Ltd for the development
of a lightweight bottle for use in the spirits sector of the drinks
market. They have developed a bottle which contains 20% less glass than
conventional bottles of both 70 and 75cl, resulting in a 22% energy
saving, a 20% reduction in raw materials, and 8% more bottles carried on
each lorry load.
In the third award category for Technological Achievement, there is
success for Aberdeen firm Underwater Excavation Ltd for their
development of their jet prop underwater excavation system, basically a
propeller with high-pressure water jets fabricated on the blade tips and
used to rotate it.
It operates without any physical contact with the sea bed and is safe
to use on live pipelines and other sensitive structures. It has
performed 400 times faster than the equipment it replaced on Bruce
Field.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry into grant claims by fish company</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978731222</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE managing director of a Lewis fish processing firm has admitted
that grant claims from his company to Western Isles Enterprise are under
investigation.
Mr Robert Johnston, head of Johnston Seafayre Ltd, based at Marybank,
near Stornoway, said at the weekend that the cause was ''a paperwork
fault'' which he expected would be shortly accepted as such by WIE.
Meanwhile, police in Stornoway confirmed they are carrying out an
inquiry following a complaint from WIE, but they refused to name the
firm involved.
Papers lodged with the Registrar of Companies also revealed that JSL's
auditors resigned last month, following a series of disputes with the
firm's management.
The auditors, Cunningham &amp; Co, of Point Street, Stornoway, submitted a
Statement of Circumstances about why they had resigned.
It confirms the ongoing investigation by WIE into the JSL grant claim.
The auditors go on to say they were ''advised'' that there were no funds
available to pay their own fees.
They had also received a series of faxes and other correspondence from
JSL which ''impugned our professional abilities''.
In his weekend statement, Mr Johnston put the various debts down to
low trading levels since JSL's formation, in the spring of 1993, which
did not permit the settlement of creditors by the due dates.
However, local creditors, including the Western Isles Council,
continued to support the company, he said, as they believed their funds
to be quite safe.
Mr Johnstone also admitted that some of his communications had indeed
impugned the professionalism of the auditors.
''They were recognised to be so and were apologised for in writing
unreservedly,'' he said.
Mr Johnston concluded that JSL was initially under-financed and was
emerging from trading difficulties and had now won contracts with major
supermarket groups around Europe.
''Obviously the bad trading record of the company has produced the
need for further capital injection and a venture capitalist has agreed
in principle to provide that working capital,'' he said.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>15</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978731223</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
I WAS present this week at what could perhaps become a bit of Scottish
farming history. It was the formation of a body to represent the
country's ostrich farmers -- now about 25 in total and still on the
increase.
Who knows, in 10 years time there may be an ostrich committee of the
National Farmers' Union of Scotland -- no jokes please about heads being
stuck in the sand.
The awkward thing is that I cannot tell you what this new body is to
be called because the 20 people present at the meeting could not agree
on whether they should be known as Scottish Ostrich Breeders or the
Scottish Ostrich Association or the Scottish Ostrich Group. An attempt
to reach a compromise with Scottish Ostrich Producers found little
favour, too.
Nothing daunted, they went ahead to appoint a chairman, a
vice-chairman and a treasurer. The question of what they are chairing or
treasuring has been left for a future meeting to decide. This failure to
reach agreement may be interpreted in two ways.
It either bodes ill for the future, with disunity forecast at every
turn, or it speaks volumes for the diplomatic skills of the
founder-chairman, Jim Baillie of Noranbank, near Forfar. He has 90 birds
and is the Scottish pioneer with four years' experience behind him. Let
us say his pragmatism is to be admired.
A video showing ostrich farming in Namibia made it all look rather
easy. Nothing is wasted. There is a market for meat (which is said to be
akin to fillet steak), for the feathers and for the hide which is much
sought after by the leather trade. Mr Baillie was sporting a very natty
waistcoat made from ostrich hide and his wife had a handbag from the
same source.
Most interesting of all -- the ostrich toe nail is sold in the East as
an aphrodisiac. Beats oysters, they say.
I was just considering transferring my loyalty from West Highland
terriers to ostriches when the men from the Scottish Agricultural
College came on with the bad news. There are a lot of risks and a fair
bit of skill is required to bring the eggs through to a successful
hatching.
There are also welfare problems. The method of collecting feathers for
the fashion trade from live birds, demonstrated on the video, is not
approved by the RSPCA and has been banned here.
Perhaps I should think twice before trying to get in on the ground
floor.
Pride before a fall
THIS has been a difficult column to write. I have been overcome by an
obsessive fear that I would misspell the word ostrich. This stems from a
recent occasion when I managed to get too many l's and not enough c's in
broccoli.
My lapse did not go unnoticed. I cannot claim there was an avalanche
of correspondence but there was a steady trickle of letters and
cuttings. As luck would have it, I had used the word more than once and
several correspondents made liberal use of highlighter pens to drive
home their point -- that this was no casual slip of the pen (or the
keyboard) but sheer ignorance.
To make matters worse, I had begun that piece saying ''Ignorance is a
wonderful thing -- if you have the leisure to marvel at its depth.''
Secretly, I was quite proud of that bit and thought I had done rather
well. Next time there was a call to submit entries for some of those
journalism awards this might be worth entering, I thought.
Pride truly does come before a fall. I began to dread the mail
delivery. Sometimes only the misspelling was highlighted. Others took
delight in underlining the word ignorance as well. I was desolate.
There is no excuse. I do recall a moment's doubt as I wrote the word
but, like Tony Hancock at his pathetic best, I believed that the muse
was upon me. The words were flowing. Time enough later for mundane
things like looking up a dictionary. Both the Shorter Oxford and Webster
International were available -- the big versions that run to more than
one volume -- but not immediately to hand. If I broke off to go next
door the spell might be broken.
By the time I finished, of course, I had forgotten the need to check
that one word. Even spelt wrongly it must have looked right because it
evaded all other precautions and got into the paper.
I have now invested in a 1700-page dictionary of my very own which is
immediately to hand. Fingers crossed.

THE letters on foxes from John Bryant of the League Against Cruel
Sports and A R Campbell of Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Hunt made
interesting reading (April 22).
Mr Campbell accused those who oppose hunting of using ''emotional
propaganda'' and then went on to use the old emotive nonsense loved by
hunters. He claimed hunters ''care for the countryside and delight in
watching nature at work'' and that hunting is an ''ancient art''.
Mr Bryant, on the other hand, had no room for emotion in his letter as
he had a wealth of facts and figures from MAFF and DAFS which proved
that when it comes to unsubstantiated propaganda the fields sports lobby
has no equal.
One fact I did find in Mr Campbell's letter was that fox hunting is
legal while hunt sabotage is illegal. This fact is not due to ancient
tradition but to new laws brought in by the Tory Government to suppress
the anti-hunting majority and protect the interests of the minority who
still kill for pleasure.
Such legislation is being extended and, in the case of the Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Bill, fictitious stories of angling sabotage have
been used to support its passage through Parliament.
In using Janet Marshall, chairwoman of the SSPCA, to support
persecution of foxes, Mr Campbell really is scraping the bottom of the
barrel. If Mrs Marshall pays people to shoot foxes on her Ayrshire farm
it shows her ignorance of MAFF and DAFS research. It does not justify
continued hunting of foxes in response to rural myth and unfounded
prejudice.
The SSPCA ought to get its act together on the hunting issue and
refuse the support of people like Alistair Campbell and others who kill
in the name of sport.

YOU may be suffering the time-warp effect yourself -- that
disconcerting feeling that the land in which you now uneasily live is
not the one in which you happily grew up, the suspicion that it no
longer enjoys those immutable certainties that once simplified the
setting of life's course.
This gloomy reflection comes to mind as a result of recent remarks by
Her Majesty the Queen, the provenance of a ''British'' ship, and the
attitude of motor insurance companies toward delinquent youth.
Let me explain. Notwithstanding the certainty of immediate turn-off on
the utterance of the phrase, ''when I was a lad'', I none the less fall
from time to time to thinking that things are not what they were, times
have changed, we have moved on -- and how.
In the immediate post-war years of my youth there was, for example, no
direct phone dialling and speech with even the Inner, never mind the
Outer, Hebrides was an adventure. An illicit glass of beer was the
height of wayward teenage ambition, with today's break-time pick-me-up
of a Tequila Sunrise for the under-10s as yet undreamed of.
There was no television, no drugs, no school trips to Mount Fuji, and
no nonsense. Social workers had not been invented and children slept
safe from the threat of a dawn raid. Food came from kitchens, not
graziers in the High Street, and jobs were for life . . . a 50-year
journey to the same office, shop, or factory with all the grim
inevitability of wartime convoy duty to Murmansk but jobs none the less.
And there was something else: the certain knowledge of a roughly evens
chance of recognition and reward for hard work and good behaviour and
the absolute racing certainty of dire comeuppance if one went the other
way, strayed from the path, and did just too much of one's own thing.
The inevitability of cause and effect -- a great spur to performance.
But that was then. Now a different writ runs and it was endorsed just
the other day by none other than the Queen on the occasion of the
arrival on these shores of the P&amp;O shipping company's latest and
greatest, the Oriana -- 69,000 tonnes of German-built cruise liner which
HM hailed as being ''the best of British''.
To explain a tricky thought process that appeared to many to be on a
par with a backward somersault on a shaky bar, Her Majesty cruised on:
''Though built in Germany she is very much a British ship: British
owned, British registered, and flying the Red Ensign. She has been
largely fitted out by British craftsmen and is almost entirely crewed by
British and Commonwealth seafarers.'' QED -- Oriana IS a British ship,
right down to her flock wallpaper and the chap who delivers sundowners
to the occupants -- possibly holidaying German shipyard workers -- of
deckchairs set out on the lee side. At the risk of being hailed to the
Tower for a swift drubbing with the headsman's axe one asks one's
Majesty: ''Was that speech for real?''
Alas, probably yes, for what followed left no let-out for those who
cling to the comfort blanket of believing that Britain in Wonderland,
and the head of its first family in particular, is even loosely in touch
with reality. Said Her Majesty of Oriana: ''She is a reminder that, for
all the changes of the modern world, we have never lost touch with our
maritime heritage . . .''
Try telling that to the good folk who live beside the Clyde, the Tyne,
the Mersey . . . beside it but no longer by it. Motoring in a foreign
car past the gaunt and redundant ruins of the shipyards that once took
their skills to the world it is unlikely that they will find comfort in
the fact that their Japanese, German, French, Italian, Korean, Spanish,
Swedish, Russian, or Indian-built car is well and truly British owned,
British registered, flies a GB plate, and is driven to the dole queue by
a true Brit.
Away from the luxury of the cruise trade and all who sail in her but
still with cars, specifically those cars owned and run by young people
under 25, a group not greatly beloved by the insurance industry. For
many youngsters keeping a mobile pride-and-joy on the road by dint of
hard work with filler and paint, DIY skills honed to economy, the stroke
that puts them back on their bike is a bill from their insurance company
for just third-party, fire and theft cover on a vehicle that might fetch
#100 at auction. Sums of #400, #500, even #600 are demanded from the
blameless and claimless with no court appearance or shred of evidence to
hint that the mad-hat style of Toad of Toad Hall is their motoring
leitmotif.
The insurers claim experience on their side and are pricing in a
sellers' market. Now, however, delinquent youth, which does not bother
with insurance but takes and drives what it will when it wants, is
causing the insurers to take note of the growing weight of claims made
by those dispossessed and damaged by the criminal fringe.
Their eyes opened to what the uninsured are costing them, the insurers
have determined to get their money too. But given that the cost of cover
for any young person convicted of -- odd expression -- joy riding,
reckless driving, and causing injury or death would be prohibitively
expensive, special cheap rates are to be put on offer to tempt the
criminal in from the cold. Just show your record of convictions and
claim the discount . . . a scheme worthy of the royal seal of approval.

READING the article by Margaret Vaughan and the comments by the
Cockburn Association and the Association for the Protection of Rural
Scotland on the green belt, one would think that Edinburgh was in
imminent danger of being lost in a vast Los Angeles-style urban sprawl,
so fast is the green belt being eroded and under threat by developers
(April 19).
The facts are, of course, somewhat different. Edinburgh is a
relatively small city even by European standards and is not part of a
major conurbation.
Its citizens are fortunate to have within city limits vast areas of
public space -- Holyrood Park, Corstorphine Hill, Blackford Hill, The
Braids to name but a few. A few miles south and east of Princes Street
one is in open countryside and this stretches unbroken all the way to
Carlisle and Newcastle.
The last thing Edinburgh needs is a rigid green belt tied like a noose
around the city. It should be allowed to grow and develop as it has done
over the centuries and not be stifled by a too strict and in my opinion
a largely unnecessary green-belt policy.

THE woman is a phenomenon. More than singer, more than actress, more
than entertainer. In the improbable event of soprano Felicity Lott ever
failing to secure work in the concert hall or on the stage, she could
take on the role of cabaret singer and show all those chanteuses a thing
or deux.
With one spat-out sibilant, at the end of Seymour Barab's bitter-sweet
song of the woman who wants a perfect limousine but who always gets just
''one perfect rose'', apparent sweetness turned to acid in Felicity
Lott's delivery and she caused hilarity among the Theatre Royal audience
who turned out for her recital last night.
The essence of her art is understatement. In her opening Schumann set,
whether in intimate or animated songs, the outstanding quality was a
sense of ease -- no pressure or force in her delivery. Over pianist
Graham Johnson's quietly sparkling accompaniment to Der Nussbaum she
floated the vocal line, weightless and with absolute control over
dynamic and tone.
Of the complexities of Hugo Wolf's songs, she made light. Even in the
dark intensity of Nachtzauber, her purity of tone shone through the
chromaticism weaved by the piano. She and Johnson are a perfect match --
through his flickering piano playing in Fruhling ubers Jahr she spun a
seamless, sustained line.
I overheard somebody saying it was a bit cool. That is the art of
Felicity Lott. In a range of French songs -- from languid Faure to
exuberant Chabrier -- she never overcooked the music. It isn't cool;
it's just intelligent. And such singing informs even lesser material,
such as some of the English songs in her final set.

THE Breadwinner and I are grandparents again. This is altogether a
good thing. It has been the excuse for almost continuous celebration for
a week.
Nine pounds at birth (you know I'm not a slave to the truth but you
wouldn't call me a liar for one ounce). It has the wide forehead with
which our family has been blessed for many generations.
''Big head and little wit, never gaed thegither yet,'' we say proudly,
though the women who have to do the child-bearing even in these days of
women's aspirations are not quite so enthusiastic about big-headed
babies.
I think of life as a series of doors to be negotiated. Birth, marriage
and death are the great big doors. And then there are all sorts of
smaller doors -- going to school, getting your first thrashing, your
first game in a real team, the first time you walked a girl home, being
old enough to vote.
Then there are the stages after coupling; the first child was special.
And the first boy child, even if it did have the hooked nose of the
other side, was special. And that could have been the societal reason
that the boy-child holds the key to continuation of the family name.
That might well have been extra important to me because I was an only
child, and my father having been illegitimate and his uncles having
emigrated, I was effectively the last of the Allans.
I was very pleased by the birth of my first son but I think it was
really more biological than anything to do with the continuation of the
name. There does seem to be something in us that makes us want to see
our genes survive through the male line.
So what now with this latest addition to the family? Is The Farmer,
who already has four grand-daughters, extra pleased that there is
another and that it is a boy?
Well, yes but only because it is a change. It is another of life's
doors that I have gone through. When it comes to the third generation,
male chauvinism no longer seems important to The Farmer. And he is not
interested in the name being carried on to the top of this hill.
It is only this last generation of us here who have been called Allan.
My mother's father was here and his name was Mackie. And his wife's
father and grandfather were here and their name was Yull. The older
Investment, whose name is now Purdie, and her husband are to follow us
here. We were very happy that we had found somebody in the family who
would keep the family's connection with the land.
But the name is hardly a worry to me.
As usual with babies the main thing was that all was well.
All is not well, however, on the ancestral acres. The Farmer has been
caught napping and it has brought the wrath of Mossie down on his head.
The barley is at the crucial stage where the three-tonne crops are
separated from the four-tonne crops. With precision timing we must heap
the manure on to the crop and bang on a great splurge of chemicals so
that growth goes into the production of seeds instead of straw. If you
are late with the chemicals you get the classic ''all show and no
dough'' crop.
And that is what is threatening. I bullied the Man of Few Words to
come and spread a hundred units of nitrogen on our six parkies of winter
barley and he did it on Saturday despite earning a huge hangover at a
wedding on Friday.
I put the chemicals on a third of the crop and then nipped off to
watch Aberdeen play Celtic. Sunday would be time enough for the sprayer.
But it rained all day Sunday and intermittently on Monday. That was
just what the crop thought it needed and it has started to shoot up. I
am looking at a great crop that will fall flat on its face at the first
shower of rain, when the heads start to get heavy.
It was no use telling Mossie that Aberdeen FC has never been relegated
in all its history and must have as much support as possible. It was no
use telling him that the whole of the North-east would be depressed if
they went down. And it was quite pointless to tell him what a great win
we had against Celtic.
''And how much have you lost by nae sprayin your crops?''
I was greatly chastened by Mossie's attitude and realise that if I
don't start behaving better he might resign or, worse and worse, he
might start charging for his advice.
This is Tuesday and when I woke I could hear a great stillness in the
air. No wind to worry me and certainly no rain. I would do it today and
might have a crop yet.
At six-thirty I drew back the curtains and could hardly believe my
eyes. The whole countryside was under a four-inch blanket of snow. It
has mostly gone by mid-afternoon but the ground is far too wet.
Of course, as is always the case in farming, there is always somebody
worse off. Poor Big Hamish has still got 400 acres to sow at his
baronial castle by the sea. What he can have thought this morning when,
with May looming, he looked out and saw the dreaded white blanket, I
shudder to think.
Mossie can't imagine either, but he'd like to find out.
He phoned me about ten o'clock. ''C'mon and we'll go and see how
Hamish is doing. I've got a couple of chains for him in case he's
needing a tow with the one-pass.''
I had to decline. ''Mossie, I'm sorry. But with the mess I've made of
the spraying I just can't bring myself to go for a jolly to see somebody
else's disaster.''
''Oh well'', he said. ''It's nae for me to say maybe, but I've a' my
sprayin done.''

THE delayed arrival of the Pastels came in the wake of their recent
Mobile Safari album, itself a big leap forward for a band who in the
past have struggled to convert good songs into great records.
Their current live incarnation is remarkably brash, hardly the lo-fi
sound associated with them, but rather a big, though not bombastic,
sound which well suits the album's better moments, Basement Scam,
Exploration Team, and Classic Lineup.
Only the false start to Thank You for Being You is a throwback to less
successful past outings. Where the Pastels seem to be opening up with A
World of Possibilities, Tindersticks seem to be drowning in their sea of
possibilities.
Their unusual instrumentation mixed with all the correct reference
points, from Hazelwood and Barry through to Cave and Waits, makes them
an appetising prospect, to which the reverential hush between songs
bears witness.
Sadly though, something appears to be missing throughout. For all the
lushness of the carefully textured sound, the songs, almost all of which
are culled from their recent, retrograde second album, failed to
impress. The vision in most instances outstrips the final execution.
Amid hardly rarified company, No More Affairs stands out as a great,
concise pop moment, while Har and Drunk Tank remind of unfulfilled
potential.
For the moment, Tindersticks' pose is far greater than their musical
poise. All this admittedly sophisticated music to stroke chins to belies
a great band lurking somewhere in the depths of their songs, which
hopefully on future tours and albums will be more to the fore.

IT HAS been called a hell on earth. Judging by the report of the death
toll in Kibeho refugee camp, that description is an understatement. The
reality sounds infinitely worse. Once again we have horrifying evidence
of man's inhumanity to man. Just what has gone wrong in Rwanda? The
civil war is over and whereas that erupted while the world was looking
the other way this is no longer the case. The United Nations has been
heavily involved in the attempts to restore order to the country and has
been hard at work providing relief to the refugees through its various
aid agencies and advice to the Rwandan Government. Yet all it seems able
to do is to warn in advance about dangers and protest afterwards when
the worst has happened. It cannot prevent them. Maybe that is asking too
much. The massacre at the camp is an atrocity by any standards but one
that will go unpunished because nobody is in any position to exact
retribution. That the troops on the Rwandan Patriotic Army should have
opened fire on the refugees comes as no surprise. The army is
Tutsi-dominated and there are still scores to be settled arising from
the genocide of the civil war when a million people died. The Tutsis
blame the genocide on the Hutus, and the refugees are keenly aware they
are a marked people. The grim fact seems to be that all the outside
world can do is wring its hands, hope that one day sanity will return to
these warring peoples, and provide whatever aid in the form of relief
that we can. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees did warn the Rwandan
Government about the urgent need to improve conditions in the camps to
prevent trouble. But if the Government is unwilling or unable to do
anything then events inevitably take their course. There has been
trouble in the camps since they were set up last July when the Hutus
fled from the advancing Rwandan Patriotic Front. But it was the
Government's decision last week to try to shut Kibeho down, believing it
was becoming a breeding ground for Hutu guerrillas, a belief probably
not without foundation, that set the latest events on course. The Hutu
refugees had some sort of safety inside the camps, none, they believed,
outside, and it was an attempt by them to break through a military
cordon which set the troops firing and caused widespread panic among the
80,000 refugees. There should be no misconception about such camps. The
people in them are held against their will. When refugees first arrive a
camp is a welcome haven from danger, but the longer any camp exists, the
closer it becomes to a prison, the rigours of camp discipline become
harder to bear, the society which develops becomes ever more volatile,
and corruption and violence become endemic as the strong men emerge to
run it from the ranks of the inmates. None of that excuses what happened
but it does explain some of the Government's fears about its continued
existence. There are no easy answers because there is nowhere else for
the Hutu refugees to go. In the absence of any better solution the camps
have to be maintained and the Rwandan Government must be persuaded of
this.

A MEMBER of Argyll and Bute District Council's planning committee
could be forced to convert his pub back to its original condition after
carrying out alterations without official planning permission.
Councillor Scott MacClure (Milton), who owns MacClure's Bar in Ferry
Brae, Dunoon, made internal improvements to his pub but may now have to
spend thousands of pounds to rectify the work.
The council's environmental health department said they received a
complaint regarding changes to the pub and were forced to act.
An inside wall had been demolished and a steel support beam erected
between the public bar and the pool table area.
A section 10 order is now being served on Mr MacClure forcing him to
rebuild a load-bearing wall.
Mr MacClure, who recently failed to gain a seat on the new shadow
council for Argyll and Bute, said he was not present at the meeting
where his eventual application was discussed .
He said: ''I am convinced there is a personal vendetta going on here
between another pub owner in the town and the local newspaper, the
Dunoon Observer.
''This action was taken by the council planners after a complaint from
another pub owner in Dunoon.
''I was not at the meeting where this was discussed. As far as I was
concerned my architects had supplied all the necessary information to
the council.''
A spokeswoman for Argyll and Bute District Council said Mr MacClure
would have 28 days to comply with the order during which time he can
appeal. However, if he refuses to meet the planners' request to
reinstate the property to its original condition, he could face legal
proceedings.

ANAIS NIN -- A BIOGRAPHY
By Deirdre Bair
Bloomsbury: #20
HERE is a name so exotic it couldn't be invented by the perfume
industry. Here is a life so bizarre it couldn't be imagined by the
artistic guile its owner strove to cultivate. Yet Anais Nin was an
innovator of real genius, even if her only brilliant creation was
herself: belletrist of literary Paris in the thirties, daring
pornographer in the forties, Greenwich Village diseuse in the fifties,
feminist icon in the sixties and seventies.
She was also famous for sex, for her long, steamy affair with Henry
Miller (and passingly with his wife June); for claiming the seduction of
her father; for tumbling her psychiatrists on their own couches; for
lightning liaisons with publishers, critics and homosexual men (she
enjoyed the challenge but failed with Gore Vidal); for the frantic
energy of her bed-hopping and the driven nature of what she called her
''emotional love tapeworm. Never enough to eat!''
Among the many shocks and frissons in Deirdre Bair's exceptional
biography is the reminder that Anais Nin died only in 1977, her last
years conducted with a stoicism and courage which gave some kind of
validation to a life which was often silly, always self-centred. (She
had a hideous cancer which started in her overworked vagina, reaping
what was sown there, as the moralist might say). She seems to belong to
a more distant past, pre-war Paris and its literary libertarians. In
1980, a few years before she died, I visited the writer Rebecca West (a
giant to Nin's pygmy, if ever there was one) in her Kensington flat and
recorded a long interview.
Dame Rebecca, talking in the present tense about writers late or
living, spent little time on Nin, who claimed intimate friendship with
her in her diaries. Said West, parenthetically: ''She's the only person
I know who committed bigamy quite calmly and got away with it. She also
falsified her memoirs.''
That synopsis of a life, however, with its flavour of judgment,
summarises all that is most extraordinary about Anais Nin: the
transcontinental ''trapeze'' on which she swung between two men for 25
years, her time with each kept secret from the other, and the volumes of
diaries with their tangle of multiple narratives which -- for all we
know and for all the committed scholarship of her biographer's research
-- may still be giving Anais the last laugh.
Not that she had much sense of the ridiculous. From the word go, her
development as a writer was handicapped by an overheated view of herself
as Artist (when she took up Spanish dancing she made her husband partner
her in private performances for their friends) but more seriously
stunted by the obsessive diary-writing, which she started when she was
11.
In the 69 convoluted volumes that followed in varieties of category --
''true,'' ''false'' and ''pornographic'', but which was which? -- fact
and fiction were blurred as she invented and reinvented narratives to
explain and define her life in terms which held the most allure. The
diaries were an addiction, a behavioural problem in the language of
therapy, and some of Anais's analysts recognised that.
When several edited and expurgated volumes were published in the late
60s they sold well, unlike most of her novels and almost everything she
wrote, except her erotica. (The two best known collections are Little
Birds and Delta of Venus). The lush excursions into the interior life
scored an instant hit with the ''Me Generation'', while feminists
endowed her with cult status for her ruminations on female psychology
and her explorations of unfettered female sexuality.
To these areas, certainly, she contributed insights: as well she might
after decades of therapy, as patient and practitioner. (The psyche
shrivels at the thought of Anais Nin as emotional health counsellor). As
speculative accounts of places, periods and personalities they also have
their value, even if their reliability is suspect. But the entire canon,
controlled by her literary executor, Rupert Pole (husband number two),
is a biographer's nightmare.
Did the philandering Joaquim Nin, her Catalan father, really molest
her as a child before walking out on his family when she was 10? Did
their voluptuous relationship resume in adult life, when she exacted her
revenge by teasing him into an incestuous affair, then rejecting him in
turn and ignoring his pleas for help when he was old, ill and penniless?
The scrupulous Deirdre Bair, whose de-coding of the diaries has been
Herculean, must still falter over some of their claims with the words,
''If we are to believe the diaries . . . '' The fact that Bair has
written a book about a chimera, a woman whose fantasies were so
deceiving and self-deceiving she has left behind only the ectoplasm of
her personality, makes her biography none the less fascinating.
As she tracks Nin's traces from 1903 and birth in Cuba to a
well-connected, worthless musician father and stoical, hard-working
Danish-French mother, her interpretative detecting is as thrilling as an
elegant psychological thriller. Whydunnit, Anais? Why swing so
exhaustingly between the two men to whom, in your fashion, you were most
faithful, unable to relinquish either, constructing huge and elaborate
edifices of lies, excuses, timetablings, false mail drops, ''safe''
phone numbers, invented incomes and imaginary work assignments?
Diverting lavish quantities of your undeniable creative energy into
maintaining them?
The prolonged and thundering crescendo to Nin's life (and to Bair's
biography) was the quarter-century spent flying between New York and Los
Angeles and her two husbands: the legitimate, long-suffering Hugo,
banker, stockbroker, frustrated artist and early conspirator in the
erotic experiments of their Paris life, and the (unwittingly)
illegitimate Rupert, step-grandson of Frank Lloyd Wright, the handsome,
parsimonious, non-intellectual forest ranger for whom Anais giddily fell
when she was 44 and he was 28.
Bair's intelligence is too thoughtful to draw the glib conclusion that
Nin engineered this emotional and physical trapeze act because it made
her relationships with both men more exciting. There is enough on record
from friends and acquaintances to be confident that it often troubled
her, and made her ill with fatigue. The explanation, if there is one, is
more complex: the practice of deluding and self-deluding had become
pathological, but she was also devoted to both men, and they to her.
Their separate parts composed the whole that was necessary to her. For
Anais Nin, driven by an emotional appetite that no one man could meet,
no one man was enough; she was forced to assemble her dream lover from
the assets and virtues of two.
You can feel sorry for Anais Nin, but you can't feel admiration. How
can you drum up respect for a phantasm draped in Indian silks and
outlined in kohl eyeliner, changing its shape to elude the grasp of an
unacceptable reality.

<HEADLINE>Future for milk production in Europe</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>JOHN BAX</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>15</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978731233</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE recent dumping of milk on fields and high quota prices are
symptomatic of a larger problem facing milk producers throughout the EU.
The overall EU market for milk and milk products varies from
''stable'' to ''declining'' and the EU production of milk still exceeds
demand by 10%, despite milk quotas.
A conference in Paris last week, organised by the French Grassland
Society (AFPF), examined the current situation for a range of European
milk-producing countries and discussed the options for developing a
sustainable industry for the future.
The situation in France is heightened by the problem of
''desertification'', or rural depopulation.
Since the introduction of quotas in 1984, milk production within the
EU has declined by 12%, although there has been considerable variation
from country to country.
Holland, the UK, Denmark and France have all reduced production by
about 16%, whereas some of the southern European countries, such as
Italy and Spain, have actually increased theirs. Despite this,
threequarters of Europe's milk is still produced in northern Europe
where the larger dairy herds are located.
There are also big variations in herd size. In Italy the average is 13
cows, in Scotland it is 91. The most significant difference, however, is
the average size of quota per herd, which in the UK is approximately
350,000 litres, whereas in France it is only 135,000.
From July this year, under the Gatt agreement, the process of reducing
the export subsidies on surplus EU dairy products which are sold on to
the world market will begin.
The agreed final reduction is 36%, which will inevitably apply
downward pressure on prices.
This is potentially a serious problem for UK milk producers, but it is
an even greater threat to countries such as France where the ability to
increase income is offset by small herd sizes and quotas.
Market forces would suggest that the process of smaller,
less-efficient producers dropping out will accelerate, but this may not
be politically acceptable in France.
There, producers have responded by increasing milk yields per cow at a
faster rate than here in the UK.
In southern Europe, yields of maize are almost double those achieved
in Britain. Higher milk prices for those involved in producing
high-value end-products, such as specialist cheeses like Parmesan and
Comte, means that it is still possible to achieve a respectable standard
of living from 25 cows in these regions.
The future, as in the UK, is unclear but what is certain is that only
the efficient producers, who can supply their milk to high-value
outlets, will prosper.
An element of national subsidy will enable some smaller producers to
continue in the more disadvantaged areas but the process of increasing
herd sizes, coupled with further reductions in the number of herds,
appears to be inevitable.

College at Crichton Royal Farm, Dumfries.

A MAJOR breakthrough in car gearboxes has been developed by Antonov
which is currently under test with several worldscale motor
manufacturers, writes ANDREW WILSON.
There is the expectation that one of the large Japanese manufacturers
will soon sign a contract.
Altogether evaluation tests are under way with 19 manufacturers and
component suppliers who will be able to use existing facilities to
produce the Antonov Transmission System.
The prime market is for cars of under two litres where there are
constraints on size to the fitting of conventional automatic gearboxes
where demand will increase as traffic congestion gets worse.
Developed by engineer Roumen Antonov who refused to collaborate with
the Bulgarian military establishment before escaping to Paris in 1988,
it has only 45 moving parts compared with 200 in the normal box. It
offers a 20% gain in fuel efficiency and is 30% smaller in size with
commensurate reductions in both weight and manufacturing costs.
Mr Antonov is visiting Scotland this week with chief executive Mike
Emmerson as part of the programme of meeting institutions to raise about
#3.5m. Cameron McColl, chief executive of the Memory Corporation, is a
non-executive director.
The monies being raised will be used to complete the commercialisation
of the development with breakeven expected in the first quarter of 1997.
Antonov's revenue will come from royalty income and appears to have the
field to itself.
The listing will be in the Alternative Investments Market under Rule
4.2.

<HEADLINE>Argyll caught in tourism trap as Britain falls behind</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978731235</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WARNING has been sounded that Argyll is too dependent on tourism, at
the same time as a new report shows Britain languishing at the bottom of
the European league for investment in travel and tourism.
In the European Union, travel and tourism is expected to grow by more
than 37% in real terms over the next decade, and will generate an
estimated 19,400,000 direct and indirect jobs in the EU this year, says
the report, by the World Travel and Tourism Council.
However, in Argyll local enterprise company officials say that the
area is over-dependent on tourism and, if it is to progress and survive
economically, an increasingly grant-dependent culture must be changed
over the next year.
In some parts of the area, particularly in north Argyll, the situation
is described as ''mayhem'' where agreements between the LEC and local
business communities are becoming ''increasingly difficult to achieve''.
Mr David McIntyre, chief executive of Argyll and the Islands
Enterprise, said: ''We must wean people off this level of thinking where
they have almost become reliant on grant aid to get businesses up and
running.
''Present Government training schemes are too restrictive and are
totally inflexible for the needs of the area. It's a myth what they say
is being achieved.''
Outlining AIE plans for the next 12 months, which include a budget
spend of more than #10.3m, Mr McIntyre said that, as far as tourism was
concerned, there had to be a change in the balance between this industry
and other sectors of business.
''It is imperative that we increase investment and development of
other sectors, particularly manufacturing. Community groups are not
economically active and they need to be encouraged more to develop their
own initiatives.
''In places like Oban, I am convinced there is something of a culture
barrier, and there is an urgent need for a cohesive response to problems
facing north Argyll. There is also a continuing low level of economic
activity on the Atlantic islands, particularly Coll, Tiree and
Colonsay.''
However, he was more optimistic about places such as Bute, which his
team was sure was ''through the pain-barrier'' in regenerating the local
economy. Around #8m is to be invested in the island over the next year.
''It is also our view that AIE must work in tandem with the new shadow
authority which will take over next year in Argyll and Bute, and it is
vital we do not trip over each other. The opening of the new ferry route
between Kintyre and Northern Ireland towards the end of June will be a
major boost to the whole area.''
During the past 12 months AIE had created 126 new jobs in the area and
helped retain a further 705, spending on average #3500 per job. More
than #13m of private funding had been attracted after AIE had invested
#5.3m.
Over the next year, AIE says it plans to increase priorities towards
training, social development and projects which will attract European
funding.
More than #7m is to be spent on new business development and support
and around #1.2m on youth training.
Meanwhile, the World Travel and Tourism Council report shows that
travel and tourism's share of total UK investment is just 10.41% -- a
lower figure than that of 14 other European countries.
The UK was also well down the list -- and far behind the leader, Spain
-- in the percentage of people employed in travel and tourism.
The report, entitled European Union Travel and Tourism -- Towards 1996
and Beyond, showed:
* Ireland (32.84%) invests most in travel and tourism, followed by
Spain (24.91%);
* 12.19% of people in the UK are employed in travel and tourism
compared with Spain (19.92%), Belgium (16.17%) and Portugal (13.70%);
* Just five countries -- Netherlands (11.33%), Denmark (10.98%),
Finland (10.89%) Ireland (10.91%) and Sweden (10.05%) -- employed fewer
people in travel and tourism than the UK;
* EU travel and tourism will create 1,700,000 new jobs over the next
ten years -- more than 465 a day, or one new job every three minutes;
But Europe's market share of tourists -- like that of the UK -- is
declining relative to other parts of the world.

makes a horrible kind of sense that most people killed by another human
being lose their life to a partner or friend. The very fact of intimacy
gives the opportunity to wound, and calculated insults from strangers
never have the same impact as those hurled by people you love.
Sometimes that intimacy becomes claustrophobic and you read of men and
women who kill those with whom they live, after years of unarmed verbal
combat provide the incentive for a moment of frenzied madness.
These are tragedies, but they are explicable tragedies.
More difficult to deal with are the unprompted actions of psychopaths.
People who kill a stranger in a bar or a bus queue with minimal
provocation. But there too there is a certain rationale if the
individual concerned can be shown to be suffering from the sort of
psychosis which makes them incapable of recognising the normal
behavioural boundaries at the moment of the crime. These are terrifying
episodes, but episodes which are induced, quite literally, by madness.
Nations involved in wars construct different kinds of alibis for the
slaughter in which they become involved. So the battle lines are drawn
in the starkest of terms, with the forces of good repelling the evil
enemy. No matter that each side mirrors the other in its capacity for
self-deception and its incapacity to concede that there may be victims
as well as villains among the people shot, bombed, and maimed.
Thus it is that we justified the carnage on the road to Basra as
allied forces incinerated columns of retreating Iraqi teenagers, driven
involuntarily into conflict by the megalomania of their country's
leader.
Thus it was that we sent bombers to raze non-military targets in
German cities during the Second World War in order, we told ourselves,
to save lives in the longer term.
And the all-purpose excuse is that this is a war situation. This is
different. We are defending our way of life from the forces of darkness.
It's the excuse used by Irish terrorists as they launch rockets at Army
command posts, or Bosnian soldiers as they burn the homes of people with
whom they recently shared their daily lives. But now they are at war,
all civilised bets are off, and all manner of atrocities can be
disguised as acts of heroism.
And then there is Oklahoma. Not a city at war, not the work of a
certified madman, not the culmination of long dispute, but the
cold-blooded killing of perfect strangers. And with that comes not the
smallest degree of comprehension. An act born of sheer fanaticism, it
seems; an act without logic or compassion.
We've witnessed its like before when suicide bombers wreak havoc in
the Middle East, when pubs full of British civilians are blown up by
people whose quarrel happens to be with their government.
At the moment it is alleged that the men who caused the carnage in
America's Midwest have no excuse save a pathological hatred of their own
Government, coupled with the standard unsavoury prejudices of right-wing
minorities towards black and Jewish fellow citizens. Chillingly these
groups say they want to resist the dilution of the ethnic purity of
white America. Where have we heard all that before? And tellingly the
constitutional right they most want to defend is that which allows each
citizen to bear arms. The devotion of the gun lobby in America to the
carrying of a personal firearm is as frightening as it is intense.
Somehow owning the means of killing another American has become
enshrined as a touchstone of American freedom.
It is a devotion which admits no paradox. No politician riding this
popular electoral hobby horse will even privately concede that the more
guns there are on streets or in homes, the more likely it is that
innocent citizens will lose their lives. It is a strange notion of
freedom which argues to increase the likely threats to personal safety.
But crazy as the general enthusiasm for weaponry is, it fails to
explain what kind of mentality can deal with the thought that it is
defensible to end the lives of men, women, and children of whom you know
nothing. That your zealotry makes sense of something so utterly
senseless as this appalling act of revenge against the Government of the
day.
One of the traits which all terrorists of this ilk seem to share is a
dreadful certainty that their cult or sect or political faction walks
the only true path. That terrifying fundamentalist belief in their own
infallibility which links the right-wing Bible-thumper of mid-America to
the ayatollahs of the Middle East.
Often -- as with the Branch Davidians who finally perished at the Waco
siege, or the Japanese adherents of Aum Shinri Kyo, or many of the
neo-Nazi organisations in Europe and America -- the basic admix of
certainty and hatred is delivered by some self-styled charismatic guru.
The devil doesn't just have all the best tunes, he sometimes has the
most persuasive disciples.
The Scottish folk singer, Sheena Wellington, wrote and sings a moving
song entitled Beirut. In it she mourns the victims of extremists
everywhere. And she finishes by asserting that their cause, whatever it
is, isn't worth the life of one baby.
Amen to that.

GLAXO has received a shot in the arm as it gets down to the major task
of integrating Wellcome with a victory in a patent case relating to its
Zantac anti-ulcer drug, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
A US court has ruled that the patent on form 2 ranitidine
hydrochloride, the active ingredient in Zantac, remains valid until the
year 2002. This means that generic drug producers cannot sell a
look-alike drug to Zantac in the US until then.
Zantac is one of the biggest-selling prescription drugs in the world,
with annual sales in the US alone of $2000m and worldwide $3500m. It is
easily Glaxo's top seller and the court result means that its sales
should hold up well until the next century.
The risk of another patent challenge elsewhere must now have receded.
An adverse judgement would have led to a flood of similar lower-priced
drugs causing Zantac's sales to nosedive.
The original case was brought in 1991 by a Canadian company,
Novopharm, which sought to sell a similar drug before 2002. Glaxo won
the first round but Novopharm appealed. The appeals court rejected all
three grounds on which Novopharm claimed that Glaxo's patent was
invalid.
The news should be positive for Glaxo's shares today.

THE doughty former Lord Provost of Glasgow, Peter McCann, is due
thanks for his thought-provoking letter, providing as it does a balanced
view surely worthy of a political figure (April 19). Too large
majorities both in Parliament and at local level are fraught with
temptations.
Just two things in particular, though. First, in furtherance of his
not too relished ''Jaffa Orange'' (Mr Happy), such will prompt those in
Helensburgh to inquire why Labour-controlled Dumbarton District Council
has given the raspberry to its own by denying it the fitting out and
stocking of the new library.
Mr McCann affirms that libraries are the ''public's constant
companion''. Helensburgh's public would much appreciate it if Mr McCann
could have a companionable chat with Dumbarton's provost who has
constantly proved obdurate on this ''partisan'' subject, to the dismay
of the apolitical in the town.
Secondly, in support of his hope for the retention of St Mungo, is it
asking too much for the reinstatement of at least some of its original
text, ''Let Glasgow Flourish By the Preaching of the Word''?
It served well in the past and I am confident its reinstatement would
be endorsed by all its churchmen, and not least by its cardinal.

Washington, Sunday -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin defended the
United States against a barrage of foreign criticism that it is pursuing
reckless economic policies and ignoring the plight of the sickly dollar.
Speaking ahead of the crucial G7 meeting tomorrow of economic
policymakers from major nations, he vehemently denied that the United
States was deliberately trying to drive the dollar down to gain a
competitive edge on world markets.
''We've been exceedingly responsible in tending to the problems of the
economy,'' said Mr Rubin. ''The things we've done, particularly the
budget deficit reduction programme, have played a major part in the
recovery we've experienced.''
But that has not stopped the leaders of Japan, Germany and the
International Monetary Fund from attacking the United States for failing
to do more to shore up its sinking currency.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl last week called US financial and
currency policies ''not acceptable'' and urged Washington to cut its
budget deficit and rescue the dollar.
The unusually blunt public criticism has set the stage for what is
shaping up to be a contentious meeting of finance ministers and central
bank chiefs from the Group of Seven -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States.
The US Treasury Secretary insisted that the United States supports a
strong dollar, saying that would help hold down inflation.
''There is an absolute and strongly-held view in the administration
that a strong dollar is in our interest,'' he said. ''What our tactics
and strategy are to bring that about . . . I choose not to comment on.''
The weak dollar -- it has dropped nearly 20% against the Japanese yen
and over 10% against the German mark this year -- has hit Japan and
Germany hard, robbing them of overseas sales and threatening to undercut
their domestic economic recoveries.
But so far, it's not had much impact on the United States. Inflation
remains moderate and US stock and bond markets have remained buoyant
despite the dollar's drop.
''We have spent the last 2[1/2] years of this administration focused
on the fundamentals of the economy,'' Mr Rubin said. ''I believe the
fundamentals have been greatly strengthened. We have a good economy.''
He dismissed suggestions that the weak dollar was an indictment of US
economic policy, instead pointing to the strength of the domestic stock
market.
''I'm not arguing that the stock market should be used as a referendum
on our economic policies,'' he said. ''But if you want a referendum,
look at the stock market -- it's at an all-time high.''
The Treasury chief sharply criticised Japan over its trade policies,
charging that its markets were ''substantially less'' open than those of
other major industrial nations. ''We think that's a serious problem,''
Mr Rubin said.
He denied that the United States was deliberately countenancing a weak
currency to prod Japan into making concessions on the trade front,
although he acknowledged that the dollar's drop against the yen may put
pressure on Tokyo to do just that.
''I don't think there's been a meeting that I've had in the 2[1/2]
years that I've been here where anybody has suggested using the dollar
as an instrument of trade policy,'' he said. -- Reuter.

CONFIRMATION is expected today that Howard Davies, currently
director-general of the CBI, will be the new deputy governor of the Bank
of England.
He will succeed Rupert Pennant-Rea, who resigned last month after
revelations of his affair with financial journalist Mary Ellen Synon.
The appointment will be widely welcomed in the City, where Mr Davies
is credited with making the CBI more authoritative in its pronouncements
on the economy. He has headed the CBI since 1992.
A rather old-looking 44, Mr Davies is no stranger to Whitehall as he
worked in the Treasury in the early 1980s and served as a special
adviser to former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. He remains
close to the Government, particularly the current Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke.
Like Mr Pennant-Rea he has no previous knowledge of banking, nor
direct experience of running a business. But he worked for several years
for McKinsey, the management consultant, and has been controller of the
Audit Commission, where he became involved with the Bank of England over
local authority losses on City dealings.
Mr Davies is an advocate of closer European integration, which will
act as a counterpoint to the greater scepticism of the Governor Eddie
George.
Mr Davies, who is married with two sons, was born in Blackley,
Manchester, and was educated at the city's grammar school and at Merton
College, Oxford, where he gained an MA in history and modern languages.
After Oxford he joined the Foreign Office and became private secretary
to the British Ambassador in Paris.
During his period at the Treasury between 1976 and 1982, he took a
further degree at Stanford Graduate School of Business in California.

THERE are no great expectations that the scheduled meeting of G7
finance ministers in Washington tomorrow will be able to cobble together
a package to arrest the decline of the tumbling dollar. But the
Americans are unlikely to be left in any doubt about the gravity with
which their apparent neglect of their own currency is viewed elsewhere.
The dollar has lost nearly 20% of its value against the yen this year,
and so it is the Japanese who are pressing hardest for action. The
strength of the yen is threatening to deal a body blow to hopes of a
recovery in the Japanese economy from its worst recession since the war.
Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura has been flirting with the idea of
target zones for currency rates, but he has no firm proposals. France,
struggling to preserve the value of the franc against the German mark,
is also anxious to bring stability to foreign exchange markets. Canada
too is unhappy with the present system. In Germany the strength of the
mark is threatening many export-led areas of economic activity, but its
leaders are more realistic in their search for a solution to the
dollar's woes.
The system of fixed exchange rates broke down in 1971 and has been
replaced by one which allows currencies to float freely against one
another. Within its own domain the European Union is trying to establish
a single currency, an objective fraught with difficulties. Two key
currencies, the pound and the Italian lira, are not even members of the
exchange rate mechanism. The old regime of fixed exchange rates was not
the model of stability the description suggests. There were frequent
devaluations and revaluations hastily devised in times of currency
crisis. Since that period the volume of foreign exchange business has
soared to the point where central banks are to all intents and purposes
powerless to intervene in the markets by using their reserves to support
falling currencies. Recent concerted interventions to bail out the
dollar and constant intervention by the Bank of Japan to stem the yen's
rise have cut no ice. The dollar is widely regarded as a weak currency,
perhaps even one in terminal decline, unless the Americans take action
to reduce their twin deficits.
The US is in hock to future generations and to foreigners who lend it
money to cover its colossal budget deficit. This has given rise to a
huge trade deficit, the largest element of which is with Japan.
President Clinton has been conspicuously unsuccessful in tackling the
budget deficit, which is turning the US into the biggest debtor nation
in history. Yet without action on this front it is difficult to see how
the dollar could be stabilised for long. The next presidential election
is only 18 months away. The budget deficit will be a big issue, but it
is not at all clear that the American public would be prepared to accept
higher taxes and lower Federal spending. The weakness of the dollar is
not as potent an issue across the Atlantic as it is in Europe and Japan.
A depreciating currency has a muted inflationary impact because so many
key imports are priced in dollars. Moreover the dollar's weakness
against the mark and the yen contrasts with its strength against the
Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar, increasingly crucial because of
the North American Free Trade Area. However, the US cannot afford to be
isolationist economically any more than politically. Sooner or later
President Clinton or his successor will have to recognise this.

LLOYD'S of London poured cold water on suggestions that the insurance
market could face closure next year because of its huge losses and past
liabilities.
Lloyd's ''names'' or members have been hit by losses running into
billions of pounds in recent years and thousands are unable or unwilling
to settle their liabilities, with more refusing to act pending the
outcome of complex litigation in progress.
If this situation persists there is a real possibility of the 308-year
old market closing down. This would enable a new form of market to start
afresh but it would be a devastating blow to the City of London and
could put tens of thousands of jobs at risk.
However, a Lloyd's spokesman declared yesterday: ''Lloyd's is trading
and intends to continue to do so. We are attempting to settle
outstanding disputes between names and their agents.
''All aspects of our operations are under review but reports of
closure are speculative. The Council of Lloyd's has made no final
decision on the future of any part of the business.''
Lloyd's is due to report another huge loss next month. Accounts are
published three years in arrears and overall losses of over #1500m are
expected for 1992. However, that should be the final year of deficit as
a return to profits is widely predicted for 1993, possibly of over
#1000m.
Before that can be reported Lloyd's will have to pass the Department
of Trade and Industry's solvency tests which all insurance companies
must take to continue trading. As things stand it will be lucky to get
through and if it fails it would have to close.
So the council is working on another plan to reach a final settlement
with dissident names, following the failure of an earlier one. This will
involve passing old liabilities on to a new company, enabling names
affected to free themselves of the yoke of unlimited personal liability
for losses.
The council may also seek to impose a general levy on names but this
will run into the problem of enforcement.

ON the principle that one believes the opposite of what our political
leaders say, I suppose the news that our nuclear capacity has doubled
should not surprise us (April 19).
I was pleased, however, to read that the Kirk is to press the
Government in scapping Trident. I fear though that the moral or
religious arguments which may be forwarded, however valid, might not
carry adequate weight with a Government concerned exclusively with image
and money.
I am not one of those morally committed to CND and for a long time
there appeared a plausible argument for the Bomb. All that was shown to
be sham, though, by the Argentinians, who demonstrated, it turned out
correctly, a cavalier insouciance over our deterrent when they invaded
the Falklands.
The other problem of Trident, of course, is that every #1 spent
contributes to the weakness of sterling as the money all goes abroad.
The same money spent on education or housing would return immediately to
the Exchequer in large part in the form of reduced unemployment benefit,
VAT, National Insurance, and income tax.
Which would make Britain greater in today's environment -- a stronger
currency and more educated population or a sham deterrent?
Our bluff has been called already. It is silly to keep pretending.

I AM sorry to have to disagree with my old colleague Peter McCann and
the comments in his letter about the old and the new local government
structure (April 19).
He seems to have forgotten that it was the agreed policy of the Labour
Party in Scotland to support most of the recommendations of the Wheatley
Commission -- including the two-tier system -- when its report was
published in 1969.
Subsequently, of course, some modifications were proposed in the White
Paper presented to Parliament in February 1971 by the then Secretary of
State for Scotland, Gordon Campbell.
The Conservative Government did, however, accept the main principles
stated by the commission. There were some further changes made during
the debates in Parliament, but these were for the most part concerned
with boundary changes sought by parochially-minded MPs and peers of all
the main parties.
It is sad that Peter McCann, who had the honour and distinction of
being elected Lord Provost of the new City of Glasgow District Council
in 1975, should be so bitter towards his former friends and colleagues
who took a different road and were elected to, and attained office in,
Strathclyde Regional Council.
The latter did its best to establish good relations with the various
district councils through liaison committees, most of which worked
reasonably well.
It is a pity also that he, after all these years, seems unwilling to
acknowledge that the regional council had to tackle many of the
so-called intractable problems which at the time were beyond the powers
and resources of the old local authorities.
Part-time education, for example, in some of its East End schools and
caused by teacher shortages in Glasgow was one of the problems inherited
by the region and eventually eradicated.
Then there is the considerable improvements brought about by
Strathclyde in public transport, the support given to electric train
services and the extension of the concessionary fares scheme for the
elderly and the disabled.
Another important feature of the 1975 regionalisation in the West of
Scotland was that it brought together, for a common purpose, local
councillors from the adjoining county councils, large and small burghs,
as well as those from the city of Glasgow.
There was, prior to this, undoubtedly some resentment about the old
Glasgow Corporation's apparent dominance in so many fields of activity.
I do hope Peter McCann is not advocating a return to that state of
affairs and that the newly elected City of Glasgow Council will in time
develop administrative, social, and economic policies which will be in
harmony with those of the adjoining local authorities.

THE Bank of Scotland in its tercentenary year dominates the list of
companies reporting this week, writes ANDREW WILSON.
On Wednesday, it is expected to report an improvement in taxable
profits from #269m to around #445m -- the analysts' range of forecasts
being between #430m to #460m.
There should be a reduction in bad-debt provisions of perhaps 25% to
#240m which will be a more staid movement than has been seen with the
English banks. However, that reflects the more stable Scottish economy
which was less hard hit in the recession than the rest of Britain.
Operating profits should have been helped by some growth in the loan
book while the volatility is reduced through there being insignificant
reliance upon dealing activities.
A specialisation in management buy-out senior debt lending where the
returns are much more substantial than on routine corporate financing
should also prove to have been a significant factor.
The general expectation is that the dividend total will rise 15% to
5.8p -- a growth rate which contrasts with the average 23% uplift seen
for those banks with a 1994 calendar year under their belts.
This morning, analysts can get their teeth into cash-rich Associated
British Foods. Although the range for the interim figures is between
#165m and #182m, leading analyst David Lang of Henderson Crosthwaite is
looking for around the #181m seen last time. That included #30m of
exceptional gains.
Although there should have been some slight improvement in the core
milling and baking side recently with some firming in prices,
competition with RHM remains severe.
British Sugar will have been more robust but the crucial factor may
well be the return on the #655m cash stockpile as of last September.
That contributed just #17m last year although the investment in fixed
interest stocks may have generated as much as #45m this time round
according to some estimates.
An unchanged 8.5p dividend is looked for.
Sears should tap profits forward perhaps #3m to around #141m tomorrow
with the British Shoe outcome the crucial ingredient. Selfridges turned
out to be the best performer with 5% better sales when Sears gave a
Christmas trading update, while the recovery at the Freemans mail order
business stalled. There is concern over the progress of the Olympus
sportswear shops which have been have hit by recesssion.
However, a dividend total increase from 3.68p to 4p is thought likely.
ICI will provide a test of the strength of British manufacturing
industry with its first-quarter trading news on Thursday. A jump from
#93m to around #175m is in sight, ignoring exceptional items, helped by
a combination of rising volumes, cost effiencies and increasing prices.
Austin Reed, which also reports on Thursday, is expected by broker
NatWest to have made #6.1m in the last financial year compared with
#4.1m.
January sales were in line with expectations, though an unseasonally
mild autumn hit sales of winter coats. A rise in raw material prices has
not impacted these figures as Austin Reed was covered forward on cotton
prices until this spring.

IT IS now established beyond question that Tony Blair's time has come
as far as the whole Labour movement is concerned. Indeed, it may well be
that his time has come as far as the voters of this country are
concerned.
Here stands a man who has put his stamp on his party in a way that
no-one has done since Clem Attlee in the forties. His self-confidence is
such that he can even praise Margaret Thatcher for her sense of purpose
and determination.
On Saturday, nobody doubts that he will succeed in his bid to reform
Clause 4 of the party constitution and effectively bury the old
nationalisation argument. Carthorse trade unionists have been outflanked
by the 100,000 who have signed up as new members of the Labour Party in
the 12 months since he became leader.
This allows him to state that not only will he do no deals with the
trade unions to get what he wants, but he will trigger more changes that
will further diminish their influence. By the time of the next General
Election, the Tories will be hard put to undermine him as being
dominated still by trade-union interest.
The Clause 4 confrontation has pleased his constituency parties,
rather to the trade unions leaders' surprise. This entitles him to say
to them: ''You had better join the train before it leaves the station.''
Bill Morris, the transport workers' leader seemed rattled yesterday.
His union, he said, has not finally decided about Clause 4 -- this will
be up to its 75-member delegation attending Saturday's special party
conference. Let it be noted that yesterday Blair again rejected Morris's
demand for a commitment now to a #4 minimum wage.
It seems that Morris, whose TGWU is no longer the biggest union, has
been entrapped by Blair's new party democracy. His programme of
consultation within the union about Clause 4's replacement was not done
by individual member-ballot. There are some 7000 TGWU branches, but
there were only 67 responses to the consultation -- and these came
mainly from regional and district committees.
The TGWU's 850,000 members gives the union between 10% and 12% of a
total conference vote. This represents 18% of the total trade union
vote, which in turn is about 70% of the conference vote. This sort
influence in the new Blair Labour movement can be deployed with
authority only if membership ''consultation'' has been carried out
democratically and exhaustively.
No wonder Morris now says, rather limply, that the TGWU delegation
will have a final say on Saturday. His union's opinion, such as it is,
looks like being beached in an overwhelming response to Blair's
requirement to ditch Clause 4. This is a salutary lesson, not only for
the TGWU but all trade unions.
What we are looking at here is not just a new Labour Party, but, as
Blair called it yesterday on BBC radio, a ''reborn'' Labour Party.
Marxism is declared utterly dead. In continental Europe they call them
social democratic parties or Christian democratic parties; they work
their electorates on broad aspirations, based on what can be afforded by
individual nations (heavily subsidised by the European Union).
It is dangerous to make direct comparisons between Britain and
continental Europe, but if Blair has judged the mood of the British
electorate correctly, it may not matter very much any more that there is
little difference between his economic policy and that of the Tories.
No sooner had Blair replaced John Smith as Labour Leader than he was
accused of lacking any policy and lacking vision about what Labour ought
to be doing in the best interests of the country. What talk of this
survives, comes mainly from the Government which first sought to create
''clear blue water'' between Tory and Socialist and now seeks the
opposite. There cannot be ''clear blue water'' because, they say, Blair
has stolen their clothes.
He will continue to do so, so long as his party allows him. And the
evidence is that his party is cheering him on to steal even more. What
is the point of knocking doors for votes with no chance of power? What
is wrong with determining policy on national interest rather than
socialist dogma? This is the essence of Blairism.
Majorism is stuck still in frightful problems while the Tory party in
the Commons remains unprepared to give him blind loyalty in everything
he requires of him. It makes it absolutely impossible for Major (despite
his competent attempts twice a week at Commons Question Time) to force
Blair to define his remedies for a nation doing quite well in world
markets, but without the confidence to acknowledge it.
What is acknowledged on all political sides now is that Britain has to
do well in world markets just to keep our heads above water. You won't
catch Blair in government attempting to reverse the Tory trade union
legislation on strike ballots, secondary picketing, etc. To him that
sort of thing is totally irrelevant to a prosperous Britain. It would be
''daft'', he says.
No wonder he finds himself able to praise Margaret Thatcher. She has
provided a platform for him to relaunch the alternative party of
government. The irony is that, without her, he would be starting from
scratch, much like Major. Given the same breaks by his Tory back
benchers as Blair has enjoyed from his, Major might have done as well at
relaunching Conservatism for the twenty-first century.
The fact is that the fledgling Blair has performed brilliantly as a
successor to Smith and Kinnock. He has turned his battle on Clause 4
into a much bigger publicity coup in the tussle for those all-important
middle-England disaffected Tory voters. You might almost say that there
is little more that he can do to convince them that he will be safe as a
Labour Prime Minister.
Meanwhile, the Tories still dither about whether it would be right to
get the nine whipless ones back into the fold -- a matter of increasing
irrelevance as they allow Blair to build up his leadership credentials
on the back of a united party.
Tory MPs should note that many of their number are standing as
Independents in the May local elections in England and Wales as their
best chance of getting elected. Modern Blair and his candidates have the
luxury of calling themselves Labour with impunity.

THE absence of the ''feel-good'' factor among consumers may not be a
bad thing, according to economists at one of the major high street
banks.
Stronger consumer demand would force up economic growth and unleash
inflation, argue Patrick Foley and Trevor Williams of Lloyds Bank.
The Government and the Bank of England would respond with a much
higher base rate than the current 6.75%, they warn in the bank's latest
economic bulletin published today. ''Hopes for a return of the feel-good
factor, either now or later, are probably misplaced. Consumers are
probably feeling as good as they ever will outside an inflationary
boom.''
Even without a return of the feel-good factor, say the economists,
interest rates are set to rise by about 1% by the end of the year to
curb a short-term increase in inflation.

What a pity that all his learning, hard-won though he told us it was,

Mr Penney's zeal for truth would be easier to swallow if he

I WISH Jim Hewitson would scotch the myth that there were Scots and
English in a modern sense during the Hundred Years War.
Edward III's mother tongue was French, as was David II's. They were
just as French as the Dauphin. Henry V was fighting for his homeland,
Normandy.
He told the starving inhabitants of Rouen, who met him during its
siege in 1419 to seek terms, that it was his own city: they could not
bargain with the proprietor.

IN your article, Stronger rural links -- Labour spells out countryside
priorities (April 14), it is significant that Labour's rural affairs
spokesman, Dr Gavin Strang, says Labour would strengthen the links
between Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise ''with
a more active rural remit''.
My organisation is leading the environmental and economic regeneration
of a devastated part of our ''rural'' landscape, the central belt
between Edinburgh and Glasgow.
If Scottish Enterprise were to give rural development and rural
environments the priority they deserve, it could be one of our most
effective allies in improving the wellbeing and opportunities of the
inhabitants of this region.
However, although Scottish Enterprise refers to environmental
improvement with some very fine words in its strategy, the fact that it
has all but closed down its rural and environment functions in SE
National and across the network demonstrates that it is not as seriously
committed to strategic, region-wide infrastructure and image-improvement
works as it would have us believe.
And, despite being nominally one of the major partners in the Central
Scotland Forest initiative, it declined to provide a senior-ranking
speaker at the recent launch of the Forest Strategy, in contrast to two
other partners who sent their chairmen.
The benefits of image-improvement works take a long time to achieve,
but they last a long time once they are in place. They are essential to
the competitive advantage that a region like Central Scotland, and
indeed the whole of Scotland, needs to attract and continue to attract
vital investments, and which SE should be continuing to help deliver.
We have also been trading on our increasingly vulnerable positive
image and the efforts of others for too long.
Dr Strang appears to have put his finger on a serious flaw in SE's
current practice, and we need the support and interest in environmental
and rural affairs to which he alludes.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday dismissed as
''total rubbish'' reports that Labour leader Tony Blair wants to limit
the size of the proposed Scottish parliament to 112 seats.
Mr Robertson said Labour would decide on its preferred figure only
after it had consulted the party's members, and he was confident that
agreement could be reached with the Scottish Liberal Democrats, its
major partner in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, who want a
145-seat assembly.
He was commenting on a report in a Sunday newspaper which suggested
that Mr Blair had told him he wanted to limit the Scottish parliament to
112 members to ensure Labour control.
Mr Robertson said: ''Tony Blair has been briefed, as you would expect
the party leader to be briefed, on the issue. The leadership has always
taken the view that it should be a parliament of a reasonable size --
not too big, but not too small to do its job.
''But there has been no instruction to me about sticking to 112.''
Mr Robertson said his own personal preference was a figure ''around
that mark''. But he added: ''We are working towards a consensus on the
Scottish Constitutional Convention whereby the agreed figure might well
be between 112 and 145.
''We have achieved a unique and historical consensus over the last few
years and I am hopeful we can achieve consensus on this as well.''
He said Labour would be consulting its members, through party branches
and affiliates, to get their views on the size of the parliament and its
configuration, particularly the question of gender equality.
The consultation exercise was agreed at a meeting of the Scottish
Labour Party's executive on Saturday. General secretary Jack McConnell
said it was hoped that the results would be available by late June or
early July.
A meeting of the convention was to have taken place in June to
finalise details of the assembly plan. But Mr Robertson said yesterday
that this meeting had already been postponed because of the Perth and
Kinross by-election.
Last night, Mr Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats,
said: ''Clearly, there is a gap between the two parties on the number of
seats we would like to see. But we have come a long way on negotiations
between us and I am confident that we will clear the last hurdle.''

IS it a record? Four brave Conservative heads above the parapet in
three days -- even if some may suspect this has something to do with the
Conservative leadership being so busy aiming its bullets at its own
feet.
Whatever the reason, it is good to see Scotland's Conservatives openly
espousing the cause of democracy, pleading with their leaders to listen
to the Scottish people, and to change policy accordingly.
As councillors John Young and Brian Meek know well, the ''wipeout''
prophesied by Allan Stewart has more to do with the Government's
insensitivity and intransigence towards the Scots, above all the Scots'
desire for more democratic control of our own affairs, than all the sex
and sleaze or the divisions over Europe.
Unwanted privatisations of public infrastructure and services,
unaccountable quangos and unfair taxes like the poll tax and VAT on
fuel, are all examples of how we are ruled against, rather than
according to, our wishes and values.
In the local elections the Scots said, ''Listen or disappear'', and
this was hard on those local Conservative councillors who had tried to
listen but had been overruled by London.
It is greatly to be hoped that the Scottish Conservatives will listen
to Lord Cockfield, former Conservative Cabinet Minister and European
Commissioner, and acknowledge that ''the Scots don't like being governed
by the English Government in Westminster'', especially when it is such
''an extreme example'' of the centralised superstate''.
The new federal (in the proper sense of that word) United Kingdoms,
constitutionally comparable with Australia, Germany, or Switzerland, for
which he argues, are surely a political position compatible with
Conservative principles, and manifestly more acceptable to the Scottish
people than the present centralised superstate.
All Scots who look forward to the imminent Scottish parliament and
wish for a genuinely representative democracy welcome these signals and
hope the Scottish Conservatives will now join in the planning for the
new, proportionally representative parliament and will, in due course,
play their part in it so that the full spectrum of Scottish political
opinion is adequately represented.

ALI SYED observes that the election results in Bearsden offer the
Tories no hiding place (April 20).
The same cannot be said of the Labour Party which was most definitely
hiding as it only contested half of the wards in Bearsden. The Bearsden
electors may have pronounced their verdict on the Tories; however, the
same electors were hardly given the chance to pronounce on the Labour
Party.
It is quite ironic that while Tory Blair dallies with Middle England
his Scottish apologists treat Middle Scotland with such contempt.

Have women gone too far in their demands for equality? Or is the
hostility towards them symptomatic of a powerful elite determined to
hang on to every shred of privilege? In the first of a major new series
which examines the changing roles of women and men in modern Scotland,
Kirsty Scott investigates the backlash with leading US feminist Susan
Faludi.
HE WAS trying to get his own back after she turned him down for a
date, but the man who suggested Susan Faludi read an article in Newsweek
ended up changing her life and influencing the lives of countless others
across the world.
It was the late eighties, she was in her late twenties, and the story,
splashed all over the cover of the news magazine, concerned a
Harvard/Yale study which claimed a woman in her forties had as much
chance of being killed by terrorists as she did of getting married.
''He was a friend, a lonely bachelor who was trying to get women to go
out with him and was not having much success,'' says Faludi, through her
distinctive dry laugh. ''He called me and a few other women who had
turned him down and rather maliciously alerted us to this article. You
have to go out and read this, he said. I was flying to New York the next
day to go to a wedding and I bought it in the airport and read it. At
the wedding all the women were talking about the story.
''That was the starting point. The article caused this firestorm of
panic from college-educated women . . . the study was presenting this
Faustian pact. If you go out and achieve something or follow your
aspirations you will be punished. So I decided to do a magazine article
looking at the study itself, and what was so telling is that it didn't
take much reportorial digging to discover that the study was horribly
flawed.''
That discovery and her ensuing article grew into a wider belief that
the study was part of an increasingly adverse reaction to the women's
movement and the idea for her bestselling book Backlash was born.
It was the right book at the right time. Feminism as a concept had
been coming under increasing attack and there were no obvious standard
bearers to lead a recovery. The giants of the women's movement in the
sixties, Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan, had moved on, Camille Paglia
had yet to appear. Faludi became the open, honest face of New Feminism.
Harvard educated and a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter, she relies on
meticulous research to create her theories.
Where Paglia uses the sucker-punch of outrageous pronouncements to get
her point across -- and it is always her point -- Faludi fights with
facts. She's an unlikely feminist icon with her long, centre-parted
Janis Joplin hair, shy smile and quiet capable voice -- more folk singer
than firebrand, Nanci Griffith to Paglia's Madonna.
Backlash struck a chord with women who felt equality was something
they still had to fight for, but who were being told feminism had
already overstepped the mark and was making them miserable.
''What has made women unhappy,'' Faludi wrote, ''is not their
equality, which they don't yet have, but the rising pressure to halt,
and even reverse, women's quest for that equality.''
It's four years since Backlash was published, but despite the fact it
offered fresh impetus to the women's movement, Faludi, speaking in her
home in San Francisco, feels the situation has worsened.
''There's an article in the New York Times this morning by a
conservative woman -- who claims to be a feminist -- who was saying that
women have all their rights now, that we don't need affirmative action
any more, that we don't need any government effort to advance women,''
she says. ''There's this whole group of, unfortunately, women, who often
claim to be feminists, who are making the anti-feminist case very well,
arguing that women have gotten everything they need and it's time to
dismantle the whole effort to push for equality because we are already
there.
''What's really happening is that the door did open for a privileged
group of women at the top, but when you look below that very thin upper
layer you enter a whole different landscape in which women have made
very small progress and in fact their rights have been eroded in the
last decade.
''Social welfare programmes have been cut to the bone so poor or low
income single mothers cannot find a place to live, can't feed their
children. Everything from nutritional care for infants to day care to
housing has just been stripped to the bone. Other rights, reproductive
rights have gone backwards. This woman is living in a tiny bubble at the
top of a very large swamp . . . what's really distressing is I imagine
this is happening elsewhere too.''
She is kept abreast of developments in the UK by a network of
contacts, and has been aware of the recent British debate over the
social changes in women's lives and the question of compensatory
initiatives for men.
There's a long pause, followed by a sigh. ''It's so depressing that
this phenomenon of five minutes' worth of focus on women's rights
immediately triggers this hysteria from men that all their rights have
been taken away. It's exactly what's going on here now. Every other day
you pick up the paper and there's some story from another, usually
privileged, gentleman complaining bitterly that he has been stripped of
all of his basic rights, that women have run away with them. It's like
the two genders are looking through different lenses. It's not even a
question of the glass being half full or half empty. It's a case of does
the glass have one drop or is it overflowing. There's nothing in the
middle.
''I think the backlash has gotten much worse. It's the carrot and
stick approach. In the eighties the carrot was the strategy. Let's tell
women that if they go back to nesting, if they go back to being good
girls, getting married earlier, having their babies earlier we would
applaud them.
''None of that really worked. Women continued to marry later and have
children later and have fewer children and not give up work, and so now
it seems it's the stick approach. You see it most clearly in what's
happened in the anti-abortion movement. The backlash has taken a violent
turn, there is much more hate and hostility. There's a whole move to the
right and so much of it is aimed at women, at taking women's rights
away.
''In the UK it sounds like a similar thing. The male complaint about
too many women taking men's rights away I hear a lot from my
counterparts in the UK. It's such a classic response to very small
changes that women make in society. They are perceived to be huge
changes. I think that's because if feminism was followed through to its
logical conclusion it would challenge every aspect of society and that
is quite terrifying to those who have invested in it, so there's this
desire to cut women off at the pass. The more women push, the louder the
clamour to push back.''
It's a deeply pessimistic argument, but Faludi insists that she clings
to the hope that the only way is up, that things had to get worse before
they can get better.
''In my hopeful moments I like to think that this is the darkest hour
we are undergoing,'' she says with another deep laugh. ''We're getting
very close to a situation where it will be in the interests of men to
change and to accept women's equality and to come up with another way of
defining themselves. All their definitions are impossible to live up to
not because of feminism but because of economic change. They can't be
the sole breadwinners any more, the economy can't permit it. The idea of
man as warrior no longer applies, given the proliferation of nuclear
arms.
''This could be a real time of opportunity because there really is no
going back for men. They are really going to have to come up with
another way which incorporates the changes that women have made. Maybe
men are feeling trapped in a corner but will find a new door.''
She argues vehemently that we all, women and men, need to think more
imaginatively about how we can live, about the parameters of the family,
about the dynamics of male/female relationships. ''Where is it written
that children have to be raised in the nuclear family fashion? The most
screwed up kids are raised in airless suburban households.''
Her own upbringing falls into that very category. She was born in the
Yorktown Heights suburb of New York into a ''little Peyton Place of
Horrors,'' a world where ''all the women were playing the happy
housewife routine, except nobody was happy''.
Her mother was a frustrated writer moulded into a homemaker; her
father a businessman who liked nothing better than pottering around the
kitchen but was never home enough to potter.
''It was a very unhappy marriage and they divorced when I was in my
teens. My mother, all the women in the neighbourhood, they were
straitened in this role that was not comfortable for most of them.
''When the women's movement came along it hit my neighbourhood like a
tornado. Just about every marriage broke up. Now my mother works and is
as happy as a clam and my father potters round the house and is as happy
as a clam.''
She finds it depressing that since this early liberation of women,
disenchantment with feminism has been building to fever pitch.
''There's been an excellent propaganda job done. The younger
generation have largely been convinced that if they say they are a
feminist then men will give them a wide berth, they will be seen as
man-hating, as ugly, seen as these terrible witch-like figures who have
no place in society. Young women in particular are vulnerable to that
message.
''The concept of feminism itself is pretty hard to disagree with, that
women should be treated as human beings, that women deserve the same
liberty and dignity and respect as men. When you put it like that
everyone agrees that it's something you can't argue with, so the way to
fight it is to make feminism into this demon, which is what those who
oppose women's rights have very effectively done -- dressed up feminism
in witch clothes and watched everyone run from it.''
So who are ''they'', the ones behind the backlash, the ones directing
the derision? Faludi doesn't have a conspiracy theory for this one. She
doesn't believe in a small cell of powerful reactionaries, more in
pre-set ideas, pack journalism and a marked swing to the right among the
media.
''There was no great concerted plot to undermine women's efforts to
educate themselves. It's more that we have these pre-conceived notions
about whether or not women should push ahead and we go looking for
evidence to support our beliefs.''
She's distinctly uncomfortable with the whole ''having it all''
notion, which still clings to much of UK feminism, the idea that any
woman's ultimate goal should be career, partner and children.
''There's something about the concept that's so commercial, it's very
acquisitive. I think what we really need and want is not having all of
these things, it's creating a world in which it's possible for all
people to live in a way that's comfortable for them . . . a world in
which we are not so rigidly defined by gender.''
Her position as a role model, a spokesperson, an icon for an entire
generation is not something with which she is entirely happy. She
doesn't seek out publicity and you won't find her shouting the odds on
late night talk shows or picking sound-bite fights with fellow
feminists. At the moment she's working at home on a book on masculinity
and an article on men and pornography.
''I have a kind of fear about the icon thing. Icons tend to get
smashed and they probably should be. There are a lot of other people out
there who are working on this and thank God. I wouldn't want to be the
only one.''

<TEXT>
Paris, Sunday -- The French franc fell in skittish trading after
Socialist Lionel Jospin unexpectedly won the first round of France's
presidential election, but the currency is unlikely to collapse,
economists said.
The franc slipped to between DM3.57-DM3.58 in thin trading, compared
to DM3.5530 late on Friday, but then recovered to around DM3.5688/38.
Projections and partial returns showed Jospin will face conservative
Paris mayor Jacques Chirac in a second round of voting on May 7.
Conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who trailed narrowly
behind Chirac, has conceded defeat.
Economists said the franc was initially shaken by the result but a
Right-Left decider could underpin market confidence.
''It's a classic duel between Right and Left for the second round.
That's positive for the franc,'' said Dominique Graber, deputy chief
economist at Banque Paribas.
Economists said Chirac is likely to beat Jospin on May 7, but the
failure of polls published during the campaign to pick up the strength
of Jospin's support could make investors wary.
''It encourages us to be cautious -- both this evening and in the
run-up to the second round,'' said Antoine Brunet, head of forecasting
at Credit Lyonnais.
''The franc will not shine, but I do not see a collapse,'' he said.
He and others said the franc could drift in the short run towards
DM3.58, near a record low of DM3.5880 set in March.
The last opinion polls markets had seen, before a news blackout was
enforced a week ago, gave Chirac the lead, with Jospin and Balladur
slugging it out for second place.
Darren Williams, European economist at Merrill Lynch in London, said
currency and bond markets would be nervous during the two-week campaign
for the second round. But dollar strength would remain the key currency
factor, even for the franc.
''The dollar closed fairly weak on Friday and if it stays weak
tomorrow, that would be another reason to go towards DM3.58,'' he said.
In early Asian trade the dollar was down at DM1.3595/05 compared to
Friday's New York close of DM1.3670/75 and at 82.05/15 yen compared to
82.70/80.
Merrill Lynch's Williams saw as a positive factor for the franc the
fact that Chirac only narrowly beat his main conservative rival Edouard
Balladur into the second round.
''Chirac will now have to be more careful, having only just squeezed
in,'' he said.
A campaign row over Chirac's criticism of Bank of France Governor
Jean-Claude Trichet's comments on wages policy dented the franc in the
run-up to the first round of the election.
Chirac's attacks on what he calls the hidebound technocrats who have
presided over a huge rise in unemployment over the past decade have
prompted fears among investors that he might be tempted to put jobs

Fast women and fast cars may now be ruled out of Harold Robbins' own
lifestyle by ill health, but they are still the main attractions in his
novels, discovers Douglas Thompson
IT is the tantalising triad -- sex, money and power. For approaching
50 years Harold Robbins has been writing about it and living it and vice
versa. He is the godfather of those who followed him in the business of
producing panting and often pantless prose. His erotic epics comprise
impossibly beautiful people doing intriguing if improbable things, crude
couplings, grandiose larceny and plots with more twists and dangers than
a Grand Prix track.
One who followed was Judith Krantz who wrote Scruples which involved a
cast of characters who didn't have any. That has always tended to be the
pattern of players in the beach-bag bestsellers. Other Robbins
disciples, mostly women, include the late Jacqueline Susann on whose
life Robbins based one of his books (Lonely Lady), Danielle Steel and
Jackie Collins.
The lure, the attraction to readers is the outrageous
fantasy-fulfilment on offer. Another page, another well-steamed helping
of high life. Or low life depending on your point of view.
Harold Robbins could have walked out of any of his 21 novels. His life
is a paperback.
Critics may turn into banshees about him and the literary review
magazines can tut-tut but Robbins the storyteller has communicated with
nearly three-quarters of a billion readers in 42 languages. He boasts:
''I am the world's greatest writer in basic English. I'm a people
writer. My novels are about people. People can identify with either the
characters or their feelings.''
In 1995 he is Russia's best-selling author. And Japan's. And Denmark
and around and around the globe. He says all his books including his
first, 1948's Never Love a Stranger, and his most critically acclaimed,
1951's A Stone for Danny Fisher which chronicled a poor Jewish boy's
struggle to survive in 1940s New York, remain in print.
They have just been joined by The Raiders. It is a sequel to The
Carpetbaggers which is arguably his best known book. In 1961 the almost
cover-to-cover gratuitous sex helped sales soar into the many, many
millions. Three years later the movie starring the late George Peppard
as the novel's central character Jonas Cord -- a mirror image of Howard
Hughes -- achieved similar attention.
Cord in the original was a corporate buccaneer and extraordinary
womaniser. His mantra was sex, money and power. With The Raiders ageing
Jonas has seen the light and the chant has been changed. Now all he
wants is one good woman who luckily is half his age and a cracking
blonde.
Cue to Harold Robbins -- he will be 79 next month -- at his Palm
Springs estate in the Californian desert. Always attentive and by his
side is the fifth Mrs Robbins who is half his age and a cracking blonde.
It is pure Robbins -- fact and fiction mixed into the same potboiler.
Jann Strap was eight-years-old when The Carpetbaggers was first
published. She met the book's author in 1982 when she moved to Los
Angeles from Oklahoma where she was an advertising executive. Robbins
took her on as his assistant.
Three years later fate dealt the high-roller a bad hand. Stepping out
of the shower he slipped, tripped and crashed to the marble floor
sliding into permanently placed porcelain statues. Both his hips were
shattered. Grace Robbins -- his wife of 28 years -- was out of town. It
was Jann Strap who found him. Since then he has undergone a series of
operations, had an electronic painkiller implanted in his stomach, and
suffered nerve damage during surgery to repair his mangled bones. Since
the operation he has been -- and is -- in constant pain.
He takes over-the-counter painkillers four times a day: ''If you take
real strong painkilers you can't think straight, everything's dull.''
Strap and Robbins were ''good friends'' before the accident but it
developed. They were married on St Valentine's Day in 1992 just a week
after his divorce from Grace Robbins became final.
His mobility was ruined as well as his work schedule: ''Now I work two
to four hours a day. Before it was 12 to 16 hours. Because of the pain,
after three or four hours I've had it. It's very difficult. The writing
keeps my mind off the pain a little bit but after a while I can't go on
-- it distracts me too much.''
He retreated to Palm Springs after the accident. His palazzo is on
flat land and there are no stairs to negotiate. That slip in the shower
ended his life of bed-women-homes-boats-cars-and-continent hopping. The
two-fingered typing goes on, slower but, he feels, as effectively.
But no more sailing the Mediterranean in his 85ft motor yacht with
glamorous guests such as David Niven, Roger Moore, Michael Caine,
Charles Bronson, Omar Sharif and Gina Lollobrigida. And ''the girls''.
He recalls sailing the waters ''with two beautiful French whores I hired
as decorations''. The yacht and the girls are gone. So are the villas he
cannot visit in Acapulco and the South of France and the Beverly Hills
estate. Also the cars which included a Lamborghini, a Ferrari, a
Maserati Quattroport, Rolls-Royces, Mercedes and BMWs.
In his high life Robbins became his own best character. He was
fascinated by important money and power. Picasso sketched him. He bought
art, Marc Chagalls and work by Fernand Leger.
He also adored the glamour. When Goodbye Janette was published
statuesque fashion models paraded around a Satanic altar. At one New
Year's party scantily clad girls floated in his Beverly Hills estate
swimming pool, a fortune teller was in one room while a masseuse
entertained guests in another.
The indulgences, divorces and later the incredible medical bills have
cost him millions of dollars. He says he has no idea how much was made
or spent. That was all left to lawyers and accountants.
''I like money. I've had so many things because of it. Now all of a
sudden, I'm living in just one house in just one small town. But you
know what? I don't miss it. Jann gives me unbelievable support and makes
me realise how much I have now that I never had before. Our home and
relationship are more meaningful than anything. Maybe I'm finally
growing up.''
It's taken some time.
He was born Francis Kane on May 21, 1916, and raised in a Roman
Catholic orphanage in Manhattan until he was 11-years-old. He was
adopted by a Jewish family and renamed Harold Rubin. He was 14 when he
got his first job which was stuffing ballot boxes in a union election.
He got $2 a vote. He left school a year later. He went into business
buying crops of peas and corn and sold them on to wholesale distributors
at prices that allowed them to match those of grocery chains. He says
that by 20 he was a millionaire.
Then, he says, he got ''ambitious''. The Second World War was looming
for America. He arranged $1.5 million in financing and bought up
shiploads of sugar which was soon to be in short supply. He paid $4.85
per 100lbs. While his cargo was still afloat President Franklin
Roosevelt froze sugar prices at $4.65. The teenage tycoon went bust and
declared bankruptcy.
He dusted himself off and began working as a shipping clerk in the New
York offices of Universal Pictures. He was paid $27.50 a week.
Ironically, the man who was to make and spend fortunes earned his
spurs with Universal by saving the company money. He reclassified the
mail from first to fourth class and the executives saw a lad with a
future. He worked his way to the accounts department of Universal in
Hollywood as director of budgets.
He was not impressed by a novel Universal had bought to be adapted for
the screen. He told an executive that even he -- an uneducated orphan --
could do better. The executive bet him $100 and said: ''So, do it.''
The publishers instantly accepted Never Love a Stranger for
publication. They suggested Harold Rubin become Harold Robbins. He did.
And over the years he has written his books and his life in tandem.
He has no moans about the movies made from his books: ''The movies are
not mine -- the books are mine. The movies are a phantom created by a
thousand people.''
He says that if he had never made that bet all these years ago he
would be better off today: ''I'd be a multi-millionaire because I was
very good at making deals. I'd probably be a lot wealthier than I am
now. I've spent all my money on operations and hospitals and doctors. It
cost a fortune and there'll be more.''
Which is one of the reasons for The Raiders. He once boasted: ''Every
one of my novels is different. I've never used the same characters and
I've never told the same story. I've never written a sequel.''
Now, he has. ''Well, my values have changed and it seemed to fit. It
works for me. The character is the same but he's changed, he's not the
same. This is an extension of the story rather than a sequel to it. It
is a natural progression.''
There are also financial considerations. The Carpetbaggers has sold
more than 30 million copies and that's a lot of books. If The Raiders
gets even remotely close Harold Robbins could start buying acres of real
estate and fleets of cars again. He says he's not interested. His needs
are different.
''I want to feel better and go back to a lot of sex with my wife.''
Ah, sex and ''the girls''. He recalls walking his dog with Picasso in
the hills above Cannes and talking about ''dirty things''. He said: ''I
used to tell him the best sex you can get is from American girls. He'd
say the best sex you get is from French girls. I think American girls
are the best girls in the world. They get all the good things from all
the people in the world whereas the French are still French. You know
what I mean?''
Nostalgia brings Henry Miller to his mind. They used to have long
talks.
''Maybe we all get old enough that we don't think about sex anymore.
We think about the good things we have in our lives. The warmth and the
affection. I think that's how Miller felt when he got older and in a way
I'm beginning to feel it too.''
But you can bet the price of The Raiders that sex is not in the sunset
of Jonas Cord's life. This is a Harold ''Hot Stuff'' Robbins novel. The
characters are like chandeliers. They swing every which way.
''No, no,'' says Robbins who is clearly tiring. ''I would never want
to disappoint my fans.'' He perks up: ''Or the critics.''I am the
world's greatest writer in basic English. People can identify with
either the characters or their feelings

HANDS up those of you who know who David Martin is. With all respect
to him, it is fair to say that Mr Martin is not exactly a household name
in his native land. I was going to say prophet without honour, but that
might be a political statement.
David Martin is Labour Euro-MP for Lothian, and fairly typical of his
British colleagues in the European Parliament. With a few exceptions --
Glenys Kinnock or Winnie Ewing, for example -- very few of us have heard
of them. Go on, name the eight Scottish Euro-MPs. See what I mean?
The unusual thing about David Martin, a 40-year-old former
stockbroker's assistant and incurable Hibs fan, is that he is rather
famous outside Scotland. Each month in Strasbourg he presides over
meetings of the European Parliament, of which he is a respected
vice-president.
Throughout the core countries of the European Union -- mainly France,
Germany and the Benelux states -- he is regarded as an authority on
European constitutional affairs. His name is widely known in Continental
political circles, where his papers and articles are closely followed by
the cognoscenti.
Some years back he produced the Martin Report, which led in some part
to the Maastricht Treaty. To some he is a federalist fanatic, but most
objective observers would put him down simply as a typical Scot who
supports European integration and who is motivated by domestic political
conditioning. In other words, he thinks Europe could give Scotland a
better deal via Brussels than we get from Westminster these days,
although you should remember he is also an ambitious Labour MEP
constrained in everything he does and says by the need to get Tony Blair
into Downing Street.
Recent times have not been kind to David Martin. He was an obvious
candidate for the job of president of the European Parliament. The late
John Smith stamped on that idea because he wanted Mrs Pauline Green, the
London Labour MEP, to be leader of the big socialist group. Mr Smith
reasoned, correctly, that British MEPs would not be allowed two big jobs
in the new parliament and one of them had to give way. In such ways are
the top jobs in the EP shared out by nationality.
Mr Martin, being an authority on constitutional matters, thought he
might win one of the two posts for MEPs on the inter-government panel
considering the revision of Maastricht. Again he was foiled when the
socialists' choice was a French woman.
In the face of these setbacks he has put on an insouciant smile and,
to show he is a survivor, has just produced another report for the
parliament on how the EU should be developed when the 15 member states'
leaders sit down next year to bring us Maastricht 2. His views are
strikingly modest, less adventurous than even those of the centre-right
European People's Party, whose numbers include British Conservatives.
The heavy hand of Labour's play-safe leadership is not difficult to
detect.
Where once there would have been talk of a United States of Europe,
the federalists' dream, with elected commissioners, an elected Council
of Ministers and huge new powers for the European Parliament to fill in
the so-called democratic deficit, Mr Martin has, in effect, produced a
list of objectives not to pursue.
This latest Martin report is remarkable for what it does not say.
Abolish the national veto in the Council of Ministers and freak the
little-Englander Tories? Only up to a point, Lord Copper. Mr Martin
wants to extend majority voting but not to abolish it, as most states
would probably wish.
Tear down Maastricht's ''pillars'' where the veto serves the more
recalcitrant states (for example, Britain)? Again, not quite. The
complicated pillar structure should merely be ''reformed''.
Make foreign and security policy (including defence) and home affairs
(immigration, fighting crime) subject to a qualified majority which
could mean the UK or other foot-draggers being outvoted? No. ''Specific
features'' of the former pillars would be retained for ''certain items''
for a (unspecified) transitional period.
There's lots more in this ultra-cautious style which fits neatly with
the low-key approach to Maastricht 2 by the big EP socialist group.
British Labour influence is at play there, too.
When the socialists produced a rather more radical working paper on
Maastricht 2 it was immediately accompanied by a ''parallel'' document
personally produced by a worried Mrs Green. It was not difficult to
imagine the conversations which must have taken place between Mrs Green
and Tony Blair's office. Nothing should be suggested which might make
Labour seem dangerous, especially to a wavering middle-Englander.
Thus the green paper effectively superseded the French original and
now has been joined by the Martin report. The effect is to make British
Labour and the European socialists rather less radical in their
Europeanism than the European right. Already there have been leaked
documents from the EP talking, among other things, of a European income
tax (though that particular idea will doubtless be buried).
All of this must be good news for the British Government. Labour, it
seems, is not prepared to take on the Tories with political daring.
Rather, Labour wants almost to be more Tory than the Tories on European
integration, viz Mr Jack Straw's recent criticisms -- which can only be
described as racist -- of other EU countries' immigration systems.
Meanwhile, our Government is quietly planning a rearguard action
against any ''great leap forward'' in EU integration. It talks of a
fairer system of voting in the council, by which it means, of course, an
unfairer one. If Mr Hurd and Mr Major win the day, Britain and the
bigger EU states will have a stronger, not weaker voice, despite the
rise in the number of EU members.
Our diplomats are now talking of double majority voting where a
majority of votes in the council would have to represent a majority of
the EU population. There are other, more complicated, ideas in store,
mostly related to proportionality as Britain heads the drive to
steamroll the growing number of smaller states.
So far none of this involves the Tories' ultimate worry, the single
European currency. Economic and monetary union (Emu) is not even
formally on the Maastricht 2 agenda but already the Spanish, who take
over running the EU from France in June, are hinting that they will try
to hasten the pace.
Thus Britain's Government will find itself facing more opposition from
abroad than from HM Opposition. If Labour continues to dampen the more
adventurous European spirits like David Martin, it will end up merely
playing into the Conservatives' hands. Pity really. Whatever happened to
internationalism?

DEEDEE CUDDIHY discovers why, after 25 years in Scotland, Weight
Watchers have seen a lot less of many members.
DO YOU love chocolate fudge cake, doughnuts, salted peanuts, crisps,
whipped cream and mayonnaise Then don't read on . . . because this is a
story about Weight Watchers UK Limited and the fact that recently they
celebrated 25 years in Scotland. The event was marked in some style at
the McLellan Galleries in Glasgow where the first Scottish meeting was
held.
In attendance was Weight Watchers star, broadcaster Lorraine Kelly who
put on two stones after the birth, last year, of her first baby but took
it off again -- she's back down to 9[1/2] stones -- using WW's Slim and
Trim plan.
Kelly handed over a cheque for #25,000 to the British Heart Foundation
from Weight Watchers. She also launched Weight Watchers special 25 Years
In Scotland Cookbook, a handsome little publication which will not only
give a boost to Scottish cuisine (although I'm a might concerned that
lentil soup for four calls for only 2oz of lentils) but will raise
further funds -- 50p from the sale of each book -- for the British Heart
Foundation.
Also on hand was a select group of veteran Scottish Weight Watchers
some of whom have been with the organisation since it began here back in
1970.
''You mean, they've been slimming for 25 years and still haven't
managed to reach their target weight?'' I asked the company's public
relations person. ''No. They are people who have remained slim --
through thick and thin, as it were.''
Margaret Gibson was there. She went to her first Weight Watchers
meeting in Prestwick in 1971. She had 31lbs to lose following the birth
of two children.
Margaret left a high powered secretarial job at ICI to start a family,
and developed the habit of eating a large tub of ice cream in front of
the telly after the kids had gone to bed.
''I knew I had put on weight,'' Margaret recalls ''but it was seeing a
photograph of myself that someone had taken at a New Year party that
shocked me into doing something about it.
''After I'd reached my target and managed to keep the weight off, the
company asked me if I'd like to become a leader myself. I remember my
knees were knocking when I stood up in front of my first class but even
so, I remember thinking to myself 'this is it; this is what I want'.''
Margaret went on to become an area tutor and then an area manager in
Scotland. Now her patch includes Strathclyde, the Central Belt, Dumfries
and Galloway and Argyll and Bute where official Weight Watchers number
more than 7,000.
''Things have changed a lot since I joined the organisation 24-years
ago,'' says Maragaret. ''The regime was very restrictive then. Once I'd
reached my target weight, I vowed I'd never eat another Brussels sprout
again!''
That was in the days when meetings only took place during weekday
evenings. Now you can Weight Watch morning, noon or night, seven days a
week. In fact, you can even lose weight with the company by post.
''I never push my opinions on anyone,'' Margaret says, ''but I believe
the time eventually comes when even people who claim they are happy
being fat want to do something about their weight problem.
''I can remember when I was about 15 -- years, not stones. I was not
happy about being overweight but was unaware of it -- until an uncle who
had a gut the size of half a beer barrel, remarked that I had got
''rather stout''. If he had used any other expression I probably
wouldn't have bothered but 'stout' was such an unattractive one that I
immediately embarked on the first diet of my life.
''In a pattern that was to repeat itself over the course of the next
decade or so, I ended the diet abruptly less than 24-hours later when I
discovered that my second favourite pudding -- jam tart -- was on the
lunchtime menu at school.
''I know a number of people (usually fat ones) who view dieting as a
feminist issue; just another example of men's tyranny over women and all
the rest of it. But the fact is, dieting has provided many a female --
especially those who don't like knitting or home decorating -- with an
absorbing and relatively harmless hobby.
''However, having a first and then a second child put an end to all my
dieting. I just didn't have the time for it any more. Reluctantly, I
gave my collection of diet books away: Calories Don't Count, Thin Thighs
In 30 Days, The New Diet Does It . . . it was hard to say goodbye to my
old friends.
''The funny thing is, despite the fact that I haven't been on a diet
for ore than ten years, I'm no fatter now than I was then.''
* Weight Watchers' 25 Years In Scotland Cookbook, price #2.95, is
available from the company's Glasgow office at 101 Gorbals Street, G5

<HEADLINE>Estate owners angling for control</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978731260</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO Renfrewshire landowners want to take over management of salmon
fishings on rivers and streams on the south side of the River Clyde.
But the angling clubs and associations which presently manage the
beats, where catches have improved dramatically over the past three
years, fear that the move could price their members out of the market.
Mr Mark Crichton Maitland, of Elderslie Estates at Houston, and Lord
Maclay of Duchal Estates, Kilmacolm, are both proprietors of land
through which the River Gryffe flows.
The two men want to take over control of salmon angling activities and
establish a district salmon fishery board. They have asked Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang to approve a designation order covering an area from
Eaglesham in the south-east and Portencross in the south-west with
everything in between to the south side of the Clyde and the Ayrshire
coast.
If constituted, the land at the centre of the proposal would be called
the Southern Lower Clyde Salmon Fishery District.
Angling clubs, some of which already lease beats from the two estates,
have been taking, particularly from the Gryffe and White Cart, an
average of 100 salmon and 30 sea trout annually.
In a submission to the Scottish Office from chartered surveyors and
property consultants, Cluttons, the landowners claim that the
establishment of the district fishery board would be a first step
towards providing necessary management of the waters to which salmon and
sea trout have returned in recent years.
They say they intend to maintain, improve, and protect the habitat and
environment of the rivers in an attempt to increase stocks and improve
angling conditions.
The application states: ''At the present time, the organisation of
angling in most of the designated area is in the hands of clubs or
associations which, by their nature and method of operation, are not set
up to manage salmon stocks or salmon angling, and inevitably can only be
concerned about the stretch of the river over which they have leases.
''Of particular importance will be the supervision and bailiffing of
the district, and the present unsatisfactory arrangement will change to
one where the bailiffs, through the head bailiff, will have a single
point of contact and one body to report to.''
The applicants spell out a firm intention to tighten up controls and
warn that angling, management, and law enforcement will be handled in
''an organised and official manner in the best interests of salmon and
migratory trout''.
Under the terms of the Salmon Act, any two proprietors of salmon
fisheries can apply to the Secretary of State for Scotland requesting a
designation order for the area proposed as a salmon fishery district.
Before any permission is granted, the applicants have to advertise
their proposal and there is scope for objections and, if appropriate,
holding a public inquiry.
Under the scheme proposed by Mr Mark Crichton Maitland and Lord
Maclay, it would be the intention to close the rivers to fishing from
August 27 to March 31 each year, compared to the much shorter period at
present in operation -- October 31 to February 11.
Their submission claims the restrictions would be implemented in the
interests of conservation and to allow a new stock of fish to build up
and become established.
They add: ''The return of salmon to the rivers in the proposed
district is relatively recent and as a result, there is no effective
control over salmon fishing and the exploitation of stocks.
''In due course, a district board will bring comprehensive management
to all rivers and streams in the area to the benefit of stocks.
''The angling clubs and associations which presently fish in the area
will be able to continue doing so, and, it is anticipated, be able to
enjoy improved angling as stocks increase.''

THE Government is facing a furious fight on two fronts over its
controversial plans to privatise the nuclear industry and allow Scottish
Nuclear to be gobbled up by its English counterpart.
Scottish Conservatives are this week expected to mount an intense
lobbying campaign in favour of retaining a real Scottish presence, while
opposition MPs will meet to prepare a high profile public protest
against the privatisation.
The speed at which the Government has moved has taken observers from
all parties by surprise. On Thursday, the Cabinet is expected to approve
a merger of the Scottish and English nuclear plants in preparation for
flotation in a year's time.
The so-called ''8-0 option'', which it is believed the Government has
settled on, will threaten 500 jobs at Scottish Nuclear's East Kilbride
headquarters by putting the two Scottish and six English nuclear plants
in a single company run from south of the Border.
The proposals are a major setback for the Scottish Office and Scottish
Nuclear who favoured a separate Scottish company being given control of
two English reactors.
Former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart said last night he would
fight against the proposals to surrender Scottish Nuclear to English
control.
''People will not be in favour of this in Scotland and there will be
problems,'' he warned. ''It is unacceptable from the point of view of
control moving from Scotland, and also from the industry viewpoint that
you have no competition.''
Mr Stewart said he backed the creation of two separate companies, each
with four reactors.
''I think the ideal solution would be two Scottish power stations and
two in the North of England controlled from Scotland. I will be lobbying
for that.
'' I will also argue for a separate Scottish company operating just
the two reactors, but I can see that the City would be reluctant to back
a company with just two stations in case there was a problem with one.''
Mr Phil Gallie, Conservative MP for Ayr, said he would be fighting
hard this week to make the Government see sense.
''I think this proposal is a mistake. As a Conservative I like to see
competition and a north and south separation would have been a good
balance.
''Scottish Nuclear has a good record and it would be a shame to lose
that identity.''
Labour's Trade and Industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, warned that
the Government was facing a year of misery in the run-up to the
flotation.
''The nuclear power industry is being sold off to raise money for tax
cuts and that is obscene. There is also the safety question here. We
have never had a nuclear accident in this country under public
ownership. Why change a system that works?
''The public perception is that public ownership rather than private
is the best guarantor of public confidence,'' he said.
Mr Wilson also attacked the Government's plans to retain Nuclear
Electric's ageing Magnox reactors in public ownership allowing hugely
expensive decommissioning costs to be met from the public purse.
''The public will pay the costs of decommissioning while the usual
suspects walk off with the assets.''
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said he was totally
opposed to Scottish Nuclear being run as an outpost of Nuclear Electric
and also raised the spectre of nuclear safety.
''If you merge Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric the likelihood is
that jobs will be lost from Scotland. The other point is that a private
sector operator may be tempted to cut costs.
''The Conservative Party's position in Scotland can only be described
as tenuous. If they allow a company, which the Scottish Secretary
recently described as an example of how things are run here, to be
merged, they will really compound their political problems.''

THE IRA has placed six ''active service units'' in Britain with orders
to resume a full-scale bombing campaign on the mainland if the peace
process in Ulster breaks down, according to security sources.
Indications of a new build-up on the mainland were first detected more
than a year ago, based mainly on information from RUC counter-terrorist
section informants.
However, intelligence officers now have information that at least two
other units have slipped into the country since the IRA declared its
ceasefire last August.
The units, which usually consist of four weapons-trained terrorists
including a bomb-maker, are believed to be well-supplied with
bomb-making materials and weapons.
There are also indications that hardline sections of the IRA in South
Armagh and East Tyrone are unhappy with the cessation of terrorist
action, and hostile to further peace negotiations by Mr Gerry Adams, the
Sinn Fein president.
Mr Adams is believed to have won approval for the ceasefire from the
IRA's Army Council, a seven-member body which rules the military wing,
by only one vote at a meeting in Dublin last summer.
Another meeting of the council is to take place soon, with no
guarantees Mr Adams can continue to placate the militants. There are
even fears he himself could become a target for an internal
assassination team.
Intelligence sources say the IRA has more than one ton of Semtex, the
plastic explosive supplied during the 1980s by Libya. They also have
about 1600 assault rifles and machine-guns, rocket-launchers, and
home-made mortars.
One source said: ''There are caches of weapons and explosives already
on the mainland. The ASUs themselves are scattered throughout the
country, working normally and living unobtrusive lives. That makes them
almost impossible to identify.
''Most are also first-timers, with no track record of terrorist
activity, and no immediately obvious connection to the IRA.''
The potential for a new mainland bombing campaign was one of the
reasons why 25 of Ulster's leading counter-terrorist specialists were en
route for a secret conference at Machrihanish last June when the
helicopter carrying them crashed into a hillside on the Mull of Kintyre,
killing all aboard.
Among the dead were the chief of the RUC's special branch and nine of
his senior officers, six SAS and Army intelligence experts, six
civilians, a mixture of senior civil servants, and MI5 operatives.
The team, known as Ulster's Tactical Coordination Group, was
ostensibly arriving to deliver a briefing on projected IRA deployment to
the mainland. But sources now say there was a hidden agenda. The RUC's
vastly experienced anti-terrorist team was fighting its own internal war
against MI5 interference.
A source explained: ''Senior RUC officers were deeply concerned about
attempts by MI5 to recruit their informants. They felt that the handling
of those informants was careless and dangerous to the individuals
concerned. More importantly, it threatened the recruitment of future
informants.
''The mainland conference scheduled for last June was to have been in
the nature of a showdown between the RUC and MI5 for primacy in
undercover operations within Northern Ireland. That decision would have
been taken at the highest level of Government.''
* Hopes of agreement on the IRA's surrender of weapons were dealt a
fresh blow last night by Mr Adams.
He said ''no evidence'' had been seen or heard to support the
prediction 24 hours earlier by Tory back bencher, Mr Peter
Temple-Morris, who said Ministers would talk with Sinn Fein ''within the
next two weeks''.
Mr Adams also hinted at street protests by republicans.

PRISON inmates should have big pay rises to bring them more in line
with wage earners on the outside, an influential penal group said today.
Britain's 51,500 prisoners earn an average of #7 a week at present,
doing jobs such as cleaning, cooking, gardening, making shoes, and
clothes. Some earn as little as #4.
Instead, their pay should more closely reflect outside pay rates for
similar work so that -- after cash for their families or victims, where
appropriate, was compulsorily deducted -- they stood more chance of a
successful resettlement once released, said the Penal Affairs
Consortium.
''We would like to see it moving up substantially from what it is now,
which is pocket money,'' said Mr Paul Cavadino, the chairman of the
consortium, an alliance of 24 penal organisations representing prison
governors, prison officers, probation officers, boards of visitors, and
others.
Its proposal is one of 40 in its report -- A Joint Manifesto for Penal
Reform -- detailing how the prison service should change, published
today to mark the 100th anniversary of a radical document on prison
welfare by the then Home Office Minister Herbert Gladstone.
The consortium is arguing for a reversal of the Government's current
push towards more jail terms -- it seeks a smaller prison population,
greater use of bail, and community service and positive prison regimes
designed to equip prisoners to lead law-abiding lives.
''This approach would be far more likely to reduce reoffending and
thereby benefit society than the current trend towards a soaring prison
population and increasingly overcrowded prisons,'' said Mr Cavadino.
Among the recommendations are that:
* A sentencing council should be established as part of the Court of
Appeal to establish a comprehensive framework for sentencing.
* Prisoners should ideally be kept near their homes and contact with
their families should be encouraged.
* Greater scope for work, training and education should be provided.
* There should be a substantial increase in the help provided for
ex-offenders when they return to the community, including more
after-care hostels and training schemes.
* A country-wide system of sparing mentally disturbed offenders from
prosecution and custody should be established, involving more medium
secure hospital beds and the ''ring-fencing'' of local authority cash
for community care provision.

POLICE arrested a second suspect in connection with the Oklahoma City
bombing yesterday, but officials said he was not the dark-haired,
tattoed man they are still searching for.
FBI agents arrested David Iniquez in San Bernardino, California, on an
outstanding warrant for military desertion.
However, officials said he did not resemble the suspect known as
''John Doe II'' whose sketches have been circulated around the world.
The first suspect, Timothy McVeigh, 27, was charged with the bombing

AN ELDERLY Glasgow couple are locked in a dispute with a building firm
after their dreams of retiring to a Clydeside penthouse died when the
#120,000 flat developed serious leaks.
Four-and-a-half years after buying the two-storey flat in Carrick
Quay, Dr Hugh Taggart and his wife Agnes, from Newlands, still have not
been able to move in or resolve their problem with the builders.
Dr Taggart and his wife bought the flat when they were planning their
life after Dr Taggart's retiral as a GP.
They were quick to buy the penthouse when it was advertised by the
builder, Carrick Estates Ltd, a joint development between Balfour Beatty
Homes and the Burrell Company.
The couple did not engage a surveyor to check the flat before signing
the deal, something they now admit was a regrettable omission.
The first leak appeared in October 1990, barely four weeks after the
purchase was completed.
Water has continued to seep into the flat since then, rendering it
uninhabitable, according to the Taggarts.
Several attempts to repair leaks, which are believed to stem from
defects in the roof and patio door and window systems, have been made
over the past four years, but all to no avail, say the couple.
These efforts have included a major reconstruction of the penthouse's
flat roof in a two-week operation in July 1993, which apparently stopped
the leaks. But Dr Taggart visited the flat in March 1994 and says that
he found water ''pouring in like a tap had been turned on''.
The situation has been complicated for the couple by the demise of
Carrick Estates Limited, with the responsibility for their flat now
transferred to a company called Clarke Homes Limited.
''We did not get a survey carried out because we thought it's a new
house. We regret that now,'' Dr Taggart said.
''Now, four-and-a-half years on, we still haven't been able to resolve
the problems, nor have we been able to relax and enjoy our retirement.''
The couple, who are pushing for the return of their money, engaged a
surveyor whose report on their flat, the couple alleged, concluded that
there were defects in the roof.
They also contacted the National House Builders Council, whose
representative has visited their property. The couple have now called on
the NHBC to withdraw Clarke Homes Ltd's accreditation. The council was
not available to comment.
Dr Taggart added that they thought they had negotiated a way out of
the situation when their lawyer agreed an offer with a representative of
Clarke Homes Ltd to transfer to another property, located in Edinburgh.
However, this offer appears to have fallen through.
Letters to senior executives in both Balfour Beatty and Clarke Homes
Ltd have now produced an investigation by a Clarke Homes regional
director, who has engaged a surveyor for an independent assessment of
the flat.
The results of this survey are not yet known.
No-one from Clarke Homes was available yesterday to comment on the
couple's allegations.
The couple have been informed by letter, though, that the company
regard the defects as repaired.
The letter, dated January 23, 1995, continues: ''Several attempts have
been made to rectify water ingress through the roof. Such a problem is
often only rectified during a trial and error exercise. Each attempt
when unsuccessful 'closes in' upon the offending area.
''Whilst this is often not a series of events which is pleasing to
either the client or the builder, more often than not this is the course
a problem such as this takes.''
This was described as totally unacceptable by Dr Taggart, whose next
step may be legal action, as the couple are considering suing the
company for the distress and expense caused by the saga.
Dr Taggart admits frustration and confusion with the situation, and
expressed his anger at the perceived attitude of the company.
''What I don't understand is this. If you buy a pair of shoes which
turn out to be faulty, you can take them back to the shop and get your
money back.
''Yet here we are, having spent #120,000 on a house for our retirement
which has been consistently faulty and we're being treated, arrogantly
and viciously, like minor annoyances they can just ignore.
''This whole episode has just made us nauseous. It's turned into a
nightmare.''

<TEXT>
A FIVE-MONTH legal battle to save nearly one ton of Lanark Blue cheese
resumes today.
Cheesemaker Humphrey Errington will be at the Court of Session in
Edinburgh where a judicial review of the case will be heard by Lord
Weir.
Clydesdale District Council's environmental health department obtained
an order from a Justice of the Peace to condemn the batch of cheese in
February. The council's independent test allegedly revealed levels of
the listeria in the blue vein cheese were unacceptably high.
Twenty-four hours before the cheese was to be removed from storage at
Mr Errington's farm near Dunsyre, Lanarkshire, his lawyers obtained a
stay of execution, preventing the cheese being dumped.
Mr Errington said yesterday that a fighting fund from public donations
had grown to #14,000. He said: ''But if the case goes against us and we
have to pay costs things will be very black for us.
''I am grateful for the public's generosity, but #14,000 won't even
look at the total legal bill if we lose. I'm hoping for a decision on
Monday as this thing has dragged on for so long.
''If we lose and the cheese is condemned and we are saddled with the
costs then I will have to decide whether or not we can go on making our
cheese.''
In December last year, stocks of Lanark Blue were withdrawn from sale
after a test allegedly showed an unacceptable level of the listeria.
Mr Errington maintains that, although his cheese does contain
listeria, it is perfectly safe.

BONUSES of up to #2.5m for the top seven executives of British Gas
have been agreed under a new scheme, Labour's consumer spokesman has
claimed.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, the MP for Edinburgh South, said the executives
will get the money, on top of their annual salaries, if British Gas
profits, share price, and dividends rise to an undisclosed level.
The bonus system replaces the share-option scheme, which was scrapped
last year after severe criticism over lucrative payouts.
The new bonuses are paid in shares, valued between 33.3% to 125% of
salary, depending on the company's performance.
Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive of British Gas, could earn a
total bonus of #597,000 on top of his basic #475,000 salary. Mr Richard
Giordano, its chairman, could get slightly less at #562,000, in addition
to his annual pay of #450,000.
The loss of 25,000 jobs and closure of a number of showrooms has
crippled the gas service, leading to a record number of complaints, Mr
Griffiths said.
He demanded that the bonus scheme be abandoned, claiming that the
directors did not deserve such huge increases.
He said: ''This is an insult to 18 million gas consumers who will be
seething with anger as services are cut to the ringing of the till in
the boardroom.
''Record executive bonuses accompany soaring consumer complaints --
this is quite unjust. British Gas has taken leave of its senses.
''These directors should be facing a large pay cut, in line with the
rise in consumer dissatisfaction. British Gas must not be rewarded for
delivering a poorer service.''
''Bonuses must bear some relation to the quality of service delivered,
otherwise they cannot be justified.''
Mr Griffiths revealed that he has drawn up an amendment to the 1995
Gas Bill, currently being considered by a parliamentary committee.
The amendment, which he admitted was unlikely to be passed by the
Conservative-dominated committee on Thursday, would give the gas
industry regulator more power over pay rises.
Mr Griffiths said that the regulator body, Ofgas, should be able
indirectly to force salaries down, by threatening to cut the price of
gas.
Today the Gas Consumer Council officially releases new complaints
figures in the 1994 annual report.
It shows that complaints to GCC Scotland during the first three months
of this year almost trebled, up to 1172 from 405 in the same period last
year.
Mr Euan Robson, the GCC Scottish manager, said that the erosion of
policy-making from Edinburgh to London contributed to the rise. He said
job losses had also affected the quality of service.
He added: ''We are depressed that in 1994 and early 1995, British Gas
failed in Scotland as in the UK.''

FREED hostage Calum Murray spent his first weekend of liberty at a
secret location in London.
Mr Murray, 25, from the Isle of Lewis, looked tired but well on his
arrival at Heathrow from Guinea on Saturday morning.
The road engineer was reluctant to say much about his ordeal which
began almost six months ago at the hands of rebel forces in Sierra
Leone.
The Voluntary Services Overseas, for whom Mr Murray had been working
when he was captured on November 7, put the family up in a London hotel.
This will be a chance for him and his family to escape the glare of
publicity.
They asked for a few days together before they fly home to the village
of Gress where Mr Murray's mother, Katie Ann, is the local postmistress.
''At the family's own request, it will be a priority to get them home
to Lewis at the beginning of the week. Calum's mother, particularly,
wants to get back home to the island as soon as possible,'' said a
spokesman for the family.
There is also to be a debriefing with the Foreign Office at home on
Lewis.
''But it will be after Calum has readjusted to making decisions for
himself again,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman.
A VSO spokesman said everything that happened for the next few days
would be up to Mr Murray and his family, adding: ''The last thing we
want is to put pressure on them.''

THE owners of timeshare properties in the Scandinavian Village at
Aviemore overwhelmingly voted at the weekend to support the confiscation
of properties from those who haven't paid all their fees.
Such action in some cases, however, may itself be illegal. Most of
those affected will be people who have refused to pay legitimate
charges. But also included are some owners who have refused to pay
charges that a sheriff and a sheriff principal have both ruled cannot be
levied legally.
Among this group is Mr Charles Robson, a local government official
from Hampshire, who stands to lose his timeshare valued at #6000. On
principle he had refused to pay charges of between #20 and #30 for linen
and cleaning which were not in the original agreement with Scandinavian
Village Ltd.
The company took him to court and lost. It appealed and in June 1993
Sheriff Principal Douglas Risk issued a written judgment which held that
the company had no right to make the charges and that Mr Robson was
entitled to refuse to pay. He was awarded costs.
The company subsquently appealed against that judgment and won,
because Mr Robson failed to attend. Mr Robson told The Herald yesterday:
''They were successful by default. It was impossible for me to attend
and I made every effort to warn the court. I have, however, already
lodged an appeal and am confident this will uphold Sheriff Principal
Risk's findings. I am not sure how many people are in the same
position.''
On Saturday, however, other owners supported a motion to proceed with
the confiscations. Mr Victor Turnbull, resort manager and company
secretary, said: ''With respect to the resolution put to the membership
of the Scandinavian Village Association, that timeshare licences would
be terminated, where the timeshare owners had failed to pay the
previously approved annual charges, the result of those voting in person
at the meeting was unanimously in favour of the proposal; the overall
result of those voting both personally and by postal vote was 96.75% in
favour.''
Mr Turnbull could not say what percentage of owners voted. He added:
''But it is highly significant. It is the biggest vote we have ever had,
several hundred.''
Mr Robson, however, was not surprised and vowed to continue his fight:
''Members who voted could not know of the court ruling, because it has
never been disclosed to them or allowed to be raised in general
meetings.
''What remains clear from the sheriff's judgment is that the
association cannot make this resolution under its constitution and that
it cannot be binding on those who did not vote in favour of it.
''I am sure that where the process of confiscation results from an
ineffective resolution under the constitution and follows illegal action
by the company, there will be a legal remedy.''
He said that he would be writing to the association, seeking its
agreement that no action be taken until every member is made aware of
the terms of Sheriff Principal Risk's ruling and until the issue has
been fully debated at a general meeting.

A NEW campaign has been launched to curb speeding drivers, but was
immediately decried as a waste of public money unless linked with
tougher sentences.
The three-week long Speedwatch campaign is organised by the
Association of Chief Police Officers and backed by the Scottish Office
and the Scottish Road Safety Campaign. It will clamp down on drivers
speeding in areas with 30mph speed limits and on roads which are
well-known accident blackspots.
However, Mrs Isobel Brydie, chairman of the Scottish Campaign Against
Irresponsible Drivers, said there also had to be new legislation brought
in to allow courts to punish errant drivers more severely, especially
those convicted of causing death by speeding.
The Scottish Office Roads Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, said
that from today police forces throughout Scotland would be stepping up
action against drivers breaking the speed limit. The move is part of the
on-going campaign to reduce death and injury on the roads.
Mrs Brydie said until the law is changed such a campaign would have
only a small impact on the death toll on the roads.
Last year 85,000 motorists were caught speeding, around 10,000 of them
during the '94 Speedwatch campaign.
Mrs Brydie said: ''Such campaigns are a waste of public money unless
there is a change in the law.
''The law is framed so that drivers are getting away with killing
people and facing charges which allow sheriffs to give them only fines
or penalty points.
''Most drivers causing death or severe injury are getting away with a
charge of careless driving.
''Until there is a change in the law to bring in a charge of careless
driving causing death or serious injury or alternatively causing death
through excessive speeding then tinkering and asking drivers nicely to
reduce speed will be a waste of time and money.''
She said it was vital to make speeding offences as socially
unacceptable as drink-driving.
A Scottish Office spokesman said sentencing for speeding motorists was
a matter for the courts and they could not comment on that issue.
However, Lord James said he hoped the Speedwatch campaign would raise
drivers awareness of the dangers of speeding.
He said speed cameras and 20mph speed limit zones can help reduce the
number and severity of accidents in residential areas.
Lord James added: ''While there has been a very welcome drop in the
number of speeding offences in Scotland in the last two years, the
number of speed related accidents remain unacceptably high.''

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday increased the pressure on the trade
unions to back the revolution sweeping the party as initial results
showed overwhelming support in the constituencies for the rewriting of
Clause 4.
Heralding Labour's rebirth as ''an aggressive, left-of-centre party'',
Mr Blair welcomed the endorsement his reforms had received from those
party members who had been allowed to vote on the changes.
Ballotting in 630 constituencies began on Saturday and, by last night,
207 had voted in favour by an average margin of 86%. None had voted
against. The voting will continue until next Saturday's special
conference on Clause 4, and is expected to be decisive.
Signs that opposition to change is crumbling in the face of
grass-roots pressure were last night taken as an indication that Mr
Blair will win Saturday's vote, despite opposition from left-wing
unions.
In interviews yesterday, a confident Mr Blair put yet more distance
between the party and the unions by pointedly refusing to appeal for
their support in his campaign to reform the Labour constitution. How
they voted next Saturday was up to them -- New Labour will make no
deals.
''That is not what my leadership is about,'' he argued, ''and it is
not what the Labour Party wants. There are no deals, no trade offs. That
type of politics has no place within today's Labour Party.'' The vast
majority of trade union members share his view, he added.
A number of unions have yet to make a final decision on how they will
vote on Saturday. The powerful Transport and General Workers Union has
indicated it will vote against change, as will the public sector union
Unison.
But the TGWU leadership is under mounting pressure to move with the
party membership, raising the possibility of a last-minute reversal.
General Secretary Bill Morris said: ''Let's wait and see what the T and
G delegation does. We haven't yet made a decision, despite all the
discussion, despite all the rhetoric.''
He received no encouragement from Mr Blair. As if to underline the
growing rift between the Labour leadership and some sectors of the trade
union movement, Mr Blair emphasised that Labour would do nothing to
reverse the trade union legislation introduced under the Conservatives,
despite pressure from the unions.
Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, he said: ''There
is no support whatever in this country for abandoning all the trade
union legislation the Conservatives introduced. Those arguments are
over, they're done with.''
Instead, Mr Blair described the rebirth of Labour. ''We are witnessing
here a new Labour Party being born, a revolution in that party, in the
way it is run, in the way it is organised, in the way that its members
and its leaders are coming together behind the idea of a strong, modern,
aggressive left-of-centre party capable of taking this country into the
21st century. Now that is a very exciting and new development in British
politics.''
Although the leadership shows increasing confidence that it will carry
the special conference, it faces a mathematical obstacle. The unions
control 70% of the conference vote, and the two largest -- the T&amp;G and
Unison -- are set to vote against change. Constituencies account for the
other 30%.
Reforms agreed two years ago under John Smith call for the union share
of the vote to be reduced to 50% once party membership rises above
300,000. Mr Blair said yesterday the party had signed up 100,000 members
since he was elected leader, taking membership to 330,000.
But the work required to overhaul the voting system makes rapid change
unlikely.
Yesterday, party sources said there would be no moves to precipitate
the change this side of a General Election. But Mr Blair has made clear
that the change will come, and that it is up to the unions to recognise
it.
Meanwhile, Tory chairman Jeremy Hanley revealed he is in
correspondence with BBC director general John Birt over the
corporation's plans to televise parts of Labour's Clause 4 conference.
He said it was a ''political act of theatre'' just before the May 4
local elections in England and Wales.

A PLEDGE to spend as much money as is needed over the next five years
to promote cycling for commuting, business and recreation has been made
by the chair of Strathclyde Regional Council's roads and transportation
committee.
Councillor Charles Gordon's vision, which includes a target of 3% of
all commuter journeys being made by bicycle, includes a huge increase in
cycle parking and a network of new commuter and leisure routes
throughout the city.
Commuters will be able to cycle to the city centre from East Kilbride,
Milngavie, Bearsden, and Newton Mearns, and also use their bicycles on
an extended recreational network at weekends.
Other elements of Councillor Gordon's plan include:
* a #25m city-centre action plan which will feature the needs of
cyclists and pedestrians;
* an East/West cross-city route linking Corkerhill with Stamperland;
* and the completion of links between Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock.
''We want to persuade car owners to switch to public and human-powered
transport. Cycling is now being integrated holistically into the work of
the region and the roads department now makes automatic provision for
the cyclist,'' he said.
The increase in the cycling infrastructure is additional to the plan
for the White Cart walkway and the Glasgow-Edinburgh cycle route.
Councillor Gordon's vision was welcomed by the Glasgow Cycling
Campaign.
Its secretary, Mr Ian Spinney, commented in the campaign's newsletter:
''Nevertheless, it is clear that if all of the projects are funded (in
addition to ongoing cycling-related work within the normal roads
programme), the ongoing investment in cycling infrastructure could reach
several million pounds per annum.
''Although we are now moving in the right direction, the Glasgow
Cycling Campaign is still pressing for capital expenditure on cycling to
reach 5% of the roads budget. But there is one major obstacle looming on
the horizon -- the replacement of Strathclyde region by 10 new unitary
authorities.''
Councillor Gordon said the region's estimated annual spending on
cycling projects was around #850,000 a year.

VETERAN variety star Tessie O'Shea, who has died at her home in
Florida at the age of 82, was larger than life in more ways than one.
The star of stage, screen and radio, rejoiced in the nickname Two-Ton
Tessie.
Starting as a singer in the late years of British music hall, she soon
found her expanding girth casting her in the role of the jolliest girl
at the party, and added comedy to her act.
Her career spanned six decades, fading only in the late 1970s.
She had appeared in the Royal Variety Performance, starred at the
London Palladium and was invited to Windsor Castle by Queen Elizabeth,
now the Queen Mother.
While there she was introduced to the then Princesses Elizabeth and
Margaret, who, she was assured, were two of her greatest fans.
Billed as The Last of the Red Hot Mommas, she went on to live in
America where she was very popular, and at one stage owned two homes
there.
Born in Cardiff in 1913, she was set on the road to stardom from the
age of four, when she won a singing competition in a Weston-super-Mare
pierrot show.
She started dancing lessons while singing in local concerts near her
Cardiff home.
At 11 she went to London to sing in a charity concert, was noticed,
and was soon turning professional.
As a decidedly chubby 15-year-old, she stood in for a sick artiste in
a Blackpool summer show, and was asked by the producer to sing an
American song, Two-Ton Tessie.
The name stuck. For years she weighed around 17 stone, needing clothes
in size 28.
Her career was ending before she heeded health warnings and shed
several stones.
Her last performance was 10 years ago in Washington, when she played
the starring role in a musical.
She had long turned her talents to acting, in both musical and
straight plays and films. She was in The Blue Lamp, Disney's Bedknobs
and Broomsticks and was nominated for an Oscar for her role in The
Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming.
She never married, and once said she was happy to have ''thousands of
pals'' around the world. ''They love my fat girl act,'' she said.

A LONE hillwalker was rescued from a snow-covered Scottish mountain
yesterday after his help sign was spotted by a helicopter.
The pilot of a rescue helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth, on a fly-over
of the Cairngorms, spotted the word ''help'' stamped into the thick snow
beside a bothy. The helicopter was carrying members of Cairngorm
Mountain Rescue Team.
The helicopter, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Alan Dale with Flight
Lieutenant Steve Hayward as co-pilot, found Mr Victor Reardon, 36, of
Gidia Park, Romford, Essex, in the Strath Nethy bothy -- just two miles
from the Cairngorm Ski Centre, where 600 skiers revelled in the
conditions which had forced him to stay there overnight.
Mr Reardon was airlifted to the National Outdoor Training Centre at
Glenmore Lodge, in the foothills of the Cairngorms.
He was taken from there by ambulance to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness,
suffering from frostbite on his hands and feet and mild hypothermia.
On Saturday, Mr Reardon had walked from the Ryvoan Bothy, three miles
to the north, a trek which he expected would take him four hours. But,
because of deep snow, it actually took him 14 hours and it was late on
Saturday before he reached the hut.
When he woke yesterday he attempted to walk back to the Cairngorm Ski
Centre, but after only 200 yards decided it would be safer to stay at
the bothy.
It was then that he stamped out ''help'' with his feet in the deep
snow.
The helicopter had been searching for the bodies of two climbers
feared to have been swept away by a massive avalanche on March 6.
Cairngorm mountain rescue team deputy leader Chris Barley said Mr
Reardon was very lucky. He added: ''It was extremely fortuitous that the
helicopter was in the area at the time and he was able to attract the
crew's attention.''

Thirty years on, and the New Glasgow Society has plenty to celebrate.
It has pioneered much in the post-industrial rehabilitation of Glasgow,
and from it has sprung the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society and the
Forth and Clyde Canal Society. The society started its anniversary
celebrations with a repeat of its inaugural Victorian walk, which began
at the city's St Vincent Street Church yesterday. There will be further
walks, a film show, and civic reception during the week.

<HEADLINE>Three for court in Stephen Lawrence murder case</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978731276</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THREE men are expected to appear in court today on charges connected
with the killing of black schoolboy Stephen Lawrence, after his family
won the right to launch what is believed to be the first private
prosecution for murder in Britain.
Lawyers acting for the family successfully applied to Greenwich
magistrates in south-east London for summonses to be issued against four
men for the murder two years ago of 18-year-old Stephen.
Three were arrested on Saturday, Scotland Yard said. They are being
held at Plumstead police station and are expected to appear today when
charges are expected to be put to them.
Police would not say whether they were seeking a fourth person.
Stephen, from Greenwich, was stabbed by a gang of white youths as he
stood at a bus stop in nearby Eltham in what is alleged to have been a
racially-motivated attack.
Four teenagers were arrested, and two charged with murder in July
1993.
But the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient
evidence to convict them, and the charges were dropped.
Anti-racism demonstrators held several marches through south-east
London after no one was brought to trial.
Leading QC Mr Michael Mansfield headed a team of lawyers who made the
application in private to a stipendiary magistrate.
He asked for summonses and warrants for arrest to be issued against
four individuals.
Their names were not made public, but it is believed they are men
living in the Plumstead and Woolwich areas of south-east London.
Stephen's Jamaican-born parents, Doreen and Neville, were at the court
to hear the application but left without commenting.
They have launched a Price Of Justice appeal to meet possible costs of
#10,000 or more if the prosecution fails.
Their solicitor, Imran Khan, also refused to comment in detail. ''It
is important that nothing is said or done that could cause any prejudice
for any party in these proceedings,'' he said.
A plaque was unveiled yesterday during a memorial service near the
spot in Well Hall Lane, Eltham, where Stephen was murdered. More than
300 people attended the service which was led by the Bishop of Croydon
Dr Wilfred Wood.

THE results of tests on a dead cow suspected of suffering from anthrax
were passed to the Scottish Office yesterday.
The cow was incinerated at Ballygroggan farm at Machrihanish, near
Campbeltown, Kintyre, last week. Officials from the Agriculture and
Fisheries Department sent samples of the dead animal to their main
laboratory in Weybridge, Surrey.
A Scottish Office spokesman said the samples had been examined for the
''possible presence of anthrax''.
He added: ''The carcase of the single cow was burned as a
precautionary measure. Until an outbreak is confirmed or otherwise we
will be monitoring the situation.''
Anthrax is caused by a bacterium, bacillus anthracis, spores from
which can lie dormant in soil and animal products for years.
Five cows died on a Sutherland farm in 1993 in the last suspected
Scottish outbreak.

A MURDER inquiry was launched yesterday after a young woman died
shortly after her boyfriend discovered her lying seriously injured
outside the door of their flat in Port Glasgow.
Police said Ms Sarah Jane ''Sally'' Cannon, 20, was found in the
common close of the couple's ground-floor Inverclyde District Council
home at Kelburn Terrace, just before 1am yesterday. The couple had lived
together for four years.
Ms Cannon's 27-year-old boyfriend, whose name is being withheld by
police, is understood to have made the discovery on his return from a
night out.
The young woman was taken by ambulance to Inverclyde Royal Hospital,
but was dead on arrival. Police have not disclosed how she died.
As detectives made door-to-door inquiries yesterday, one neighbour
described the former Greenock Academy pupil as a ''stunningly attractive
girl'' and said that she had ''led a quiet life''. She was unemployed
but had attended college after leaving school.
The last positive sighting of her is understood to have been made at
Port Glasgow Juniors' Social Club about 8pm on Saturday, when she made a
telephone call.
A murder incident room was set up at Greenock police office yesterday.
Two uniformed police officers stood guard at the front and rear
entrances to Ms Cannon's home as forensic experts examined the close
area.
Ms Cannon's father, John, and her brother, Phillip, 18, could not be
reached for comment. Her mother died some years ago. Ms Cannon's cousin,
Ms Carole Anne Stanton, 26, was too upset to speak at her home in the
town's Bouverie Street.
Detective Inspector John Sherry, leading the inquiry, said he would
like to speak to patrons of Port Glasgow Juniors' Social Club or anyone
else who may have seen Ms Cannon on Saturday night.
He also appealed for anyone who may have seen or heard a disturbance
in the Kelburn Terrace area early yesterday to contact Greenock police
office, on 01475 724444.

SEVEN men were charged yesterday with public order offences after
clashes between rival football fans.
Southend police called in extra officers after being tipped off that
Carlisle United and Birmingham City fans would clash on the seafront on
Saturday night before the Auto Windscreens Shield Final at Wembley
yesterday.
Six Carlisle supporters and one Birmingham fan were arrested and
charged under the public order act with affray or violent behaviour as
around 500 fans gathered on the seafront.
They were released on police bail to appear before Southend
magistrates court on May 13.
The charges came hours after Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Graham
Taylor called upon the English Football Association to take action after
a fan spat in his face at the end of his side's 3-3 draw with Sheffield
United on Saturday. The former England manager chased after the man.
Mr Taylor said yesterday: ''It's not the first time I've been spat at
. . . It just seems that people like myself are easy targets . . . but
we've got to sort this out.''

<HEADLINE>Official in superquarry row 'to retire'</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978731280</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE official who handed a secret report to developers of the planned
Lingerbay superquarry is set to quit Western Isles Council.
Mr Graham Edwards, 51, a #40,000-a-year administrator, yesterday
refused to confirm or deny he was about to resign with a golden
handshake, but council spokesman Nigel Scott said: ''Mr Edwards has
applied for early retirement.''
The council chief executive, Mr Brian Stewart, also confirmed he was
expecting him to go. ''It's been long understood Mr Edwards was likely
to take early retirement when the public inquiry draws to a close.''
Anyone over 50 can apply for premature voluntary retirement. A golden
handshake, based on the final salary, is usually part of such deals.
A council source said: ''If there is any question of an enhanced
package, it would have to go before the personnel sub-committee.'' The
Labour group is committed to halting that process.
Last week the administrator, who has been with the council for 20
years, was named by the chief executive in a letter to Labour group
leader Callum Iain Macmillan as the person responsible for the report
ending up with Redland.
There was a storm a few weeks ago when it was revealed the
consultants' report, into the environmental effects of the plans by
minerals' giant Redland Aggregates, was being withheld from councillors
by officials.
Councillors had not authorised the #40,000 of island taxpayers' money
which it cost.
The final bombshell was an admission by officials that Redland had
been given a copy of the report.
Officials, who had insisted members did not have ''a need to know''
finally relented and have since agreed to give members the report.
Mr Edwards was one of two senior officials seconded to the public
inquiry into the South Harris quarry plan.
Mr Roddy Murray, spokesman for the five-strong Labour group, said last
night: ''Any application for early retirement by this official should be
held back until all questions over the Aspinwall report have been
answered. It was this very official who told members they would never,
ever be allowed to see the public-funded report.
''When he said that, he knew that it was already with Redland. Members
and the public have a right to a full explanation of the
circumstances.''

<HEADLINE>Veterans condemn 'German night' on VE-Day</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH war veterans have condemned an Edinburgh pub's plans for a
four-day Bierfest, to coincide with VE (Victory in Europe) Day, which
will end with a ''Dress Up as your Favourite German'' party.
A leading Tory councillor has described the event at Black Bo's on
Blackfriars Street as a ''sick stunt''.
The pub will also be laying on German bratwurst and brass-band music.
Councillor Tom Ponton -- leader of Lothian region's Conservatives -- who
runs two pubs in Edinburgh, said: ''This is cheapening the whole idea of
VE-Day. I know the pub business is struggling at the moment, but I can't
believe someone could go this far. This is no time for pub parties --
it's sick.''
The pub is not far from St Giles' Cathedral, where Princess Anne will
attend a VE-Day service on the morning of Monday May 8, along with
hundreds of veterans.
Drink for Black Bo's fun night is being supplied by Perth-based German
importer, Mr Olaf Schellenberg. Mr Schellenberg said: ''It's celebrating
the end of the war, I don't think it's tasteless.''
Ex-Royal Marine and president of Longniddry Royal British Legion Club,
Mr Bob Cunningham, 72, was outraged at the proposed festivities.
''This is terribly bad taste. You'll get hoodlums turning up in Nazi
uniforms, and things like that -- they're just dying for the excuse. I'm
surprised at a pub doing this.''
Mr Jack Agnew, 77, of Newton Mearns British Legion branch, who served
as a major with the Royal Corps of Signals, said he was appalled.
He said: ''I think it's an insult and a disgrace. For someone to think
up something like this is incomprehensible.''
The party follows other theme nights at the pub including a St
Valentine's Day Massacre soiree and a Vietnam night, when revellers
dressed as war veterans. Pub staff say a play list of German bands has
been drawn up featuring Bavarian folk music and some classical numbers,
but Wagner, Hitler's favourite composer, has been banned.
Pub owner, Mr Albert Smith, claimed to be baffled that anyone would be
upset. He said: ''It's a sort of festival for VE-Day without the
jingoism, more of a party than anything else. I don't see any reason why
anybody would be offended.
''It's not a big Nuremberg rally or anything like that. We don't want
people coming along in Nazi uniforms.
''After 'Allo 'Allo and everything else you get on television, I don't
think people will be offended. All these things depend on the spirit
they're presented in. This is celebratory.''
The commandant of Erskine Hospital in Renfrew, Colonel Ken Shepherd,
where over 200 of Scotland's Second World War military casualties are
still being treated, said the party was totally inappropriate.
He said: ''I think it's in pretty poor taste, but then a lot of things
are nowadays.''

POLICE said yesterday that no action was to be taken over alleged
racist jokes made by comedian Bernard Manning at a charity dinner, which
was organised by officers.
The comic's performance was secretly audio-taped and will be featured
on ITV's World in Action programme, Black and Blue, tonight.
The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, Mr David Wilmot, was said
to be furious that police officers helped to organise, as well as
attend, the event.
During the show, Manning targeted the only black policeman guest,
34-year-old David McIntosh.
However, Mr McIntosh said later: ''I didn't feel a victim. I expected
to be singled out. Everyone came under attack, including Scousers and
Jews.''
A police spokesman said yesterday: ''No official complaint has been
received by Greater Manchester Police about this event.
''On the basis of evidence which has been provided to us, no criminal
offences have been revealed.''
The event, which took pace at Haydock Park, Merseyside, raised #2500
for disabled officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

AN MP has stepped into a row that has shattered the normally silent
and sedate world of chess. It is over the priceless Lewis chessmen,
which are returning to their home as the centrepiece of an exhibition to
mark the opening of a new Lewis museum for the first time since they
were discovered on a remote Outer Hebridean beach, 164 years ago.
The Norse chess pieces are the most famous and distinctive in the
world. The best pieces are valued at around #1m each.
But when the Isle of Lewis Chess Club asked to use the returning sets
for a commemorative tournament involving Britain's top grandmaster Nigel
Short, they were firmly checkmated.
But Western Isles Labour MP Calum Macdonald said: ''This is utterly
ridiculous. They should be allowed to use the pieces. They are made of
ivory and chess is hardly a contact sport. What damage could they do?''
he said.
''Museum staff will be touching them. I cannot understand why
grandmasters cannot also to use the pieces for what they were after all
intended.''
The 68 pieces -- more than two thirds of the total collection --
loaned for the exhibition by the British Museum and the National Museums
of Scotland, are not to be removed from their glass armour plated
display cabinets where they will be guarded.
The full story over how the British Museum came to own 83 pieces --
they have loaned 57 for the Lewis exhibition -- and the National Museums
of Scotland just 11 is not entirely clear.
But it is believed that crofter Malcolm Macleod found the 850-year-old
carved walrus ivory pieces buried in the white sands near Ardroil at Uig
on the west coast of Lewis.

LABOUR'S inquiry into the running of its Craigielea branch in Paisley
is to be widened to cover every branch in all three Parliamentary
constituencies in Renfrewshire, it was confirmed yesterday, writes
Duncan Black.
It was revealed last week that the Scottish Labour Party had set up an
investigation into the functioning of the Craigielea branch, which
covers Paisley's Ferguslie Park housing estate. That was prompted by
allegations regarding matters such as the calling of meetings and the
recruitment of members.
Now, local party activity throughout the constituencies of Paisley
North, Paisley South and Renfrew West and Inverclyde is to be
investigated. Issues to be examined include problems which arose during
the unitary council elections earlier this month when some wards had no
official Labour candidates and some others had party members standing
against the official candidates.
The decision to conduct the wider inquiry was taken at a scheduled
meeting of the Scottish Labour Party's executive on Saturday. The
inquiry will be conducted by three members of the executive who aim to
complete their investigations within a month.
General secretary Jack McConnell said: ''We want to get to the bottom
of what happened at the council elections and make sure that anyone who
was involved with any damage caused to the party is investigated.''
Mr McConnell said the Craigielea branch would not be allowed to meet
again until party officials were satisfied that it was following the
rules.
Similarly, it was likely that the other branches would be advised not
to meet while the inquiry was being conducted, he added.
The Craigielea branch was suspended last year over complaints which
included alleged failure to give proper notice of meetings, but it was
reconstituted in December.
However, complaints about the branch have resurfaced recently and Mrs
Irene Adams, MP for Paisley North, has claimed some people are trying to
manipulate the branch as part of an orchestrated move to put key Labour
activists in positions of power locally.
Last week, Mrs Adams tabled questions in the House of Commons alleging
that a publicly-funded community business in Ferguslie Park, FCB
Enterprise Security, was being used as a front for illegal activities.
It emerged that the police were already investigating the company, which
has strenuously denied the allegations.
Mrs Adams has stated that the claims regarding the running of Labour's
Craigielea branch and those regarding FCB are separate issues.

UN troops found the bodies of thousands of Hutu men, women, and
children in the Kibeho refugee camp in Rwanda yesterday as the president
claimed only 300 died.
The slaughter took place during hours of shooting, clashes, and
stampedes.
UN special envoy Shaharyar Khan said the official death toll was 5000
but counting was going on and ''many more were buried without UN
knowledge''.
One photographer described the scene as ''a vision from hell'': women
crushed to death, men with their faces blown off, children ripped apart
by grenades, lay among the trampled remains of their belongings.
It was feared up to 8000 had died from shooting by mainly Tutsi troops
or crushed in the panic as 80,000 camp refugees tried to flee the cordon
of army guns round their compound.
Tens of thousands of exhausted survivors were being force-marched
yesterday by the army to Butare, 12 miles away. Many were collapsing
from exhaustion after having had no food or water for five days, since
the troops surrounded the camp last Tuesday in an operation to force its
closure.
Mr Khan said the biggest task for the UN now was to protect those on
the road.
Bulldozers were being sent into the camp to dig mass graves. A UN
spokesman said Government troops were also burying bodies.
The killing started when some Hutus packed into a tiny part of the
camp slashed at each other with machetes in internal disputes. Shooting
started at about noon when rain started and a mass of Hutus began to
move. Troops fired directly into the frightened crowd for an hour and
hundreds were killed as the Hutus stampeded under fire.
''There are people macheted on the inside of the camp, people
stampeded, people who were shot and killed by other weapons: hand
grenades and we believe mortars,'' said Major Peter Seaman of the
Australian UN medical support force.
Witnesses said the troops also bayoneted survivors who tried to
escape.
UN officials and journalists also saw the troops firing
indiscriminately into thousands of fleeing men, women and children.
One Reuter reporter, Julian Bedford, described how he and aid workers
yesterday picked up dead children from the road and laid them aside to
move their car forward. ''When we reached corpses lying three deep we
gave up and turned around.
''Dead babies lay by the roadside. Living babies crawled along after
being deserted by their mothers. Soldiers picked through piles of
belongings abandoned by their owners.''
President Pasteur Bizimungu's claim that only 300 died was
contradicted by all the senior UN officials in Rwanda as well as foreign
witnesses.
However, there was a wide variation among the UN observers.
The commander of the peacekeeping force in Rwanda, Major-General Guy
Tousignant, describing the slaughter as a ''regrettable incident'', said
Australian and Zambian soldiers at Kibeho had counted 4050 corpses.
Major Mark MacKay of the UN's Integrated Operations Centre in Kigali
gave a death toll of about 8000, but the UN Assistance Mission for
Rwanda said in a statement: ''After taking a more scientific count of
the number of deaths, the figure has been revised to approximately
2000.''
President Bizimungu, visiting the corpse-strewn camp yesterday, told
reporters: ''The figure that has been given has been exaggerated. There
were 300 dead.
''It is a pity that people have died but the people inside the camp
had arms and were violent people.
''People have said 8000 died. Have you seen them?'' he asked, standing
before a hillside still dotted with bodies.
Belgium condemned the brutality of Rwandan troops and France called
for those responsible to be punished. The United States said it was
saddened and concerned.
According to the Government version of events, gunmen among the 80,000
Hutus penned into a small compound at Kibeho started the shooting.
The Hutus had refused the mainly-Tutsi army's orders to leave the camp
and return to their villages.
What followed, Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu said in a radio
interview in Paris, was a ''legitimate response'' by troops.
UN aid officials said the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) used mortar
bombs when troops came under fire from a number of armed Hutus.
The UN troops at Kibeho witnessed the killing but did not try to stop
it. Their peacekeeping mandate from the Security Council does not allow
them to use force in such circumstances.
Most RPA soldiers are from Rwanda's Tutsi minority which was the
target of a campaign of genocide by Hutu hardliners last year. An
estimated one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus died.
Photographer Paul Lowe described the scenes at Kibeho as ''like a
vision from hell''.
''Through the carnage walked RPA soldiers carrying umbrellas in one
hand and long sticks in the other which they used to poke the people on
the ground to see if there were any still alive,'' he said.
Last night, the horrors continued, with the thousands struggling along
the muddy road from Kibeho.
The camp itself was relatively quiet: there were still hundreds of
wounded; about 1000 uninjured survivors; and the dead.

THE chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Sandy Macara,
yesterday joined nurses and midwives in attacking Government plans for
''destructive and ideologically-driven'' local NHS pay deals.
Speaking at a Junior Members Forum in Belfast, he said they were
linked to trust managers' perception of success in meeting their
''business plans'' and had nothing to do with the quality of
professional performance.

LORD Younger of Prestwick, the chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland,
is among the British bank bosses who have enjoyed excessive pay
increases paid for by thousands of job losses, Labour claimed yesterday.
Mr Ian McCartney, the Shadow Employment Minister, has produced figures
which show Lord Younger received a 14.6% pay increase in 1994, taking
his salary to #192,332, while the bank made a profit of #532m.
He claims that the benefits to the bank and Lord Younger were paid for
by 4200 job losses since 1990. In total, 72,200 jobs have been shed by
banks since 1990, despite profits totalling more than #6500m.
Labour's analysis claims that the chairmen of six major UK banks
received pay increases of between 14 and 37% in 1994, and that only one
bank director received less than #50,000.
It shows that, between 1993 and 1994, the average pay of the chairmen
of the major banks rose by an average 20.5% to #349,438, while average
profits rose by 38.9% to #6691m.
Mr McCartney said: ''It is obscene that bank bosses who have been
enjoying bumper pay and profits, are axing branches and threatening
thousands of their staff with the sack.
''These figures show that in boardroom after boardroom directors have
been enjoying an orgy of greed, paid for by cutting the jobs of their
employees, and local services to their customers.''
However, Lord Younger's salary was by far the lowest of those produced
by Labour. The nearest was the chairman of Lloyds, who earned #292,931
last year. The chairman of Barclays earned #523,000.

In Paris
SOCIALIST Lionel Jospin overturned all predictions last night by
leading the first round of France's presidential election with
conservative Paris mayor Jacques Chirac forced into second place.
For right-wing Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, once expected to romp
to an easy victory, the battle was over. He conceded defeat and urged
his supporters to back Mr Chirac in the decisive second round on May 7.
The other shock was the score of extreme-right National Front leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen, set to win more than 15%, the anti-immigration
crusader's highest ever score.
Provisional results showed Mr Jospin with 23.21%, Mr Chirac 20.47%,
and Mr Balladur 18.54%.
''Everything shows that the people of France have decided that Mr
Jospin and Chirac will go through to the second round,'' Mr Balladur
said.
''The future of France lies in profound change, a more fraternal and
freer society. It also will involve more Europe. We must choose.''
He went on: ''I will vote for Jacques Chirac in the second round and I
ask all those who have supported me to do likewise, to defend the
projects we have in common.''
His fellow Gaullist, Mr Chirac, later thanked the Prime Minister for
his support. He said: ''The results show the state of worry and doubt of
our country. French society is more unjust, more dangerous, less
united.''
A delighted Mr Jospin asked voters to rally behind him on May 7.
In a statement he thanked those who had placed him at the top of the
ballot and added: ''Tonight I address all those of you French men and
women who were expecting real change: I appeal to you to rally round my
proposals.''
However, with votes for the left and right at roughly 40% and 60%
respectively in the poll and with the vast majority of the supporters of
the unsuccessful Gaullist candidate likely to vote for the other in a
fortnight's time, it seemed unlikely last night that Mr Jospin, despite
his dramatic first round victory, could win the vital May 7 vote.
He did at least stun his opponents last night. ''I can't believe it,
the polls must be wrong,'' said Ms Danielle Kuss, president of a Chirac
support committee near Paris.
Yesterday's results ensured a traditional right-wing left-wing battle
instead of the fight between Mr Chirac and Mr Balladur predicted by many
opinion polls and which would have had a highly destructive effect on
the Gaullist RPR camps.
Mr Jospin and Mr Chirac will be vying to succeed Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand, who steps down in May after 14 years in power.
The outcome was a staggering turnaround for Mr Jospin who had feared
until the last minute that he might not even reach the second round, yet
alone lead going into it.
Supporters at his election headquarters were so surprised that they
had not even laid on any champagne.
Mr Le Pen, meanwhile, spoke of ''a great political success''.
He attacked what he called the ''handicaps'' of his campaign, accusing
French television of having reserved far more time to the ''three
candidates of the system'' than to him.
He blamed the independent far right candidate Mr Philippe de Villiers,
for drawing away votes and preventing the National Front from getting
through to the second round of voting with a ''sterile and paracitical''
campaign.
He predicted ''the crucial problems'' of France would worsen and
announced a major demonstration in Paris on May 1, the feast day of St
Joan of Arc, during which he would give instructions to his supporters
how to vote.
''You are going to have to reckon with us,'' Le Pen's number two, Mr
Bruno Megret, said.
The Trotskyist candidate Arlette Laguiller said last night that her
score of more than 5% was well over half the votes for the Communist
candidate, Mr Robert Hue. ''It shows our ideas had a real impact against
the background of economic scandal and huge profits while so many are
unemployed.''
Mr Hue said the result showed a significant increase in support of the
Communist Party. He said the central committee of the party would
announce on Wednesday whether it wished its voters to support Mr Jospin
in the second round.
Mr de Villiers, whose 5% was less than he had hoped, called for
mobilisation against Mr Jospin
Mr de Villiers said: ''There is a real danger this evening of a new
victory of the left. I cannot accept it. We must do everything to beat
the Socialist candidate. We must at last get France out of socialism.''
Mr de Villiers's poor score probably means he will not have an
important role in any future right-wing government.
The last word, but first step in the coming campaign came from Mr
Chirac. ''I invite the French to join me,'' he said, echoing de Gaulle's
historic 1940 call to French Resistance when he said: ''I invite the
French to hear me and follow me.''

SCOTTISH productions triumphed in two of the leading categories at
last night's Bafta awards ceremony.
Shallow Grave, backed by the Glasgow Film Fund, was named as
outstanding British film of the year, while BBC Scotland's Takin' Over
the Asylum was voted best drama serial.
Their success, which came within weeks of Peter Capaldi's Oscar, will
be seen as further encouragement for the Scottish creative community.
The Shallow Grave awards were collected by producer Andrew Macdonald,
director Danny Boyle, and writer John Hodge. Baftas for Asylum were
received by producer Chris Parr, director David Blair, and writer Donna
Franceschild.
Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane took the best television actor title
for his role in Cracker, which was named as best drama series and most
popular TV programme.
The British film Four Weddings and Funeral turned the tables on
Forrest Gump, scooping five awards to overshadow the American
multi-Oscar winner.
The comedy, which has made more than #170m at the box office, won the
awards for best film, best director for Mike Newell, best actor for Hugh
Grant, best supporting actress for Kristin Scott Thomas, and was named
most popular film.

Bragg's moving interview with Dennis Potter, during which the terminally

to complete his final two TV programmes.

for best single TV drama was won by Skallagrigg, a BBC2 show starring

The awards ceremony was attended by a celebrity audience, including
Tony Curtis, Raquel Welch, Michael Caine, Greta Scacchi, Elle McPherson,
Gina Lollobrigida, Joan Collins, and John Travolta.
Hugh Grant's girlfriend, actress Liz Hurley, again turned heads among
fans outside the London Palladium for the ceremony, when she arrived in
a low-cut John Galliano fuchsia pink dress.

End launch of Four Weddings, for which she wore a Versace dress held
together with safety pins.
