RICHARD HOLBROOKE, the US mediator who brokered the Bosnia ceasefire
announced this week, is a tough negotiator renowned for his straight
talking.
The agreement for a ceasefire from next Tuesday and peace talks later
this month in the United States crowns weeks of hectic shuttle diplomacy
by Holbrooke in former Yugoslavia.
Some of Holbrooke's colleagues say he is prepared to pull out all the
stops to get the job done.
''He's a pretty intense negotiator, he's tenacious. He can be jovial
but I have heard he can also be somewhat abrasive,'' said a Western
diplomatic source of the Assistant Secretary of State.
Officials said Holbrooke asked Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to
allow President Clinton to announce the deal, reflecting its importance
to the US administration. With a presidential election coming next year,
President Bill Clinton wants one big foreign policy headache solved.
Holbrooke has taken on the task, winning agreement on a 51%-49% split
of Bosnia in favour of the government and its Croat allies, a post-war
power-sharing arrangement, and now a ceasefire.
Later this month, officials are to begin negotiating in the United
States on the remaining issues including an exact division of territory
-- the issue that has stymied all previous peace deals.
Holbrooke's first breakthrough in late August was to win approval for
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to bargain on behalf of the Bosnian
Serbs. Milosevic is intent on getting international sanctions lifted
against his country, and having him negotiate on behalf of the Bosnian
Serbs certainly eased the rebels' acceptance of the ceasefire.
Even though they only won half a loaf, officials said it was important
that the United States was guaranteeing it.
And if the United States can keep the pressure on both sides until a
viable peace is found, this may be the last ceasefire.
Holbrooke, a New Yorker, has been called other things, some believed
to be unprintable, in the United States.
There appeared to be no love lost between him and some in the US State
Department after unfavourable comments he made about the bureaucracy in
a newspaper article this year. Others respect his style.
''He's not one to mince his words,'' the source said.
A bullish negotiator, Holbrooke has proved to be just what is needed
to bring ethnic rivals in Bosnia to the negotiating table.
''He certainly knows the issues, has a lot of ideas, and wants to get
things done,'' one diplomat said.
Holbrooke is said by some analysts to be in a different league to
peace envoys before him -- Lord Carrington, Lord Owen, Thorvald
Stoltenberg -- who have all failed to achieve a lasting settlement.
''There is a big difference. He's American, he has the US
administration behind him, and he has the power to deliver,'' a Zagreb
political analyst said.
''He has come with a strategy and it could be that all sides are now
ready for some straight talking.''

GOLF: GERMAN MASTERS
RUSSELL Claydon set two records and equalled two others when shooting
a magnificent 11-under-par 61 in the second round of the Mercedes German
Masters in Berlin yesterday.
The 29-year-old Cambridge golfer who makes jokes about his tubby,
16[1/2]-stone frame, broke the course record of 63 set by South African
Ernie Els in this event last year and will earn a bonus of #3000 if
no-one equals or beats his score this week.
His 61, giving him a two-round aggregate of 127, equalled the lowest
round on the European Tour this year -- Germany's Alexander Cejka also
shot 61 in the Austrian Open in August -- and his 36 holes figure was
the best of the year.
Claydon also equalled the feat of American Freddie Couples in the
Scandinavian Masters four years ago and of Els in the Dubai Classic last
year of having 12 birdies in his round.
It might have been better for Claydon, who had started at the tenth,
three-putted from 20 feet at the sixth hole and missed a six-foot putt
at the seventh.
The amiable Claydon grinned as he said: ''When I hit my approach at
the sixth to 20 feet I was thinking if I knock this one in I could break
60 because the eighth and ninth are birdie holes. Then I putted up six
feet short and missed the next putt so I stopped thinking.''
Claydon, currently No.65 in the European Order of Merit, said he had
suffered a disappointing year but has played better since seeing his
long-time coach Eddie Birchenough two weeks ago.
The former Walker Cup player stressed he felt no need to keep his
weight down -- unlike his Tottenham football heroes. ''I would be bored
to tears if I did. I can play 36 holes a day quite easily, so I've no
plans to train with Spurs,'' he said.
Despite his outstanding score, at 17 under Claydon is only one shot
ahead of Sweden's Anders Forsbrand, who had a second successive 64 for
128, a round which began at the tenth and ended with six successive
birdies from the fourth.
Then come two more Swedes, Per-Ulrik Johansson, who shot 66 for 130,
and Freddie Lindgren, who scored 63 for 131.
In the race to be European No.1, Bernhard Langer, who always appears
to play well in his native Germany, is coming up fast on the rails.
Langer is nearly #128,000 behind Sam Torrance with only this
tournament and the Volvo Masters in Valderrama left to play but he has
not given up hope of finishing top dog for the third time in his career.
He shot 66 for 133, six behind Claydon, but still in contention for
the first prize of #108,330 with two rounds to go.
Torrance, in contrast, could manage only a two-under-par 70 for 141
and could lose considerable ground on the German superstar unless he
improves over the next two days.
Montgomerie, #980 ahead of Torrance, dropped out on Thursday with
wrist trouble so the race for the No.1 spot will go all the way to the
wire.

RANGERS defender Alan McLaren's Champions' League dream turned into a
nightmare yesterday as he was handed a three-match suspension by UEFA.
The Scotland defender was red-carded after 76 minutes of the 1-0 defeat
by Steaua Bucharest in Romania last month.
Now he has been ruled out of two matches against Italian giants
Juventus on October 18 (away) and November 1 (home), and the Glasgow
return against Steaua on November 22. But a Rangers spokesman said: ''We
will appeal against the decision through the usual UEFA channels.''
French referee Alain Sars sent off McLaren and Steaua's Damian
Militaru in Bucharest for an off-the-ball incident witnessed by a
linesman. The referee later confirmed he had sent the pair off for
fighting and regarded it as violent conduct. McLaren served a one-match
automatic ban when Rangers drew 2-2 with Borussia Dortmund in Glasgow 10
days ago.
But now, if UEFA's three-match ban stands, he will only be available
again for the Scottish champions' final match in the group in Dortmund
on December 6.

ATHLETICS:
COLIN Jackson yesterday delivered an explosive ultimatum designed to
bring down the chief executive of the British Athletics Federation --
but it could rebound on the Welshman, jeopardising his dream of winning
Olympic gold in Atlanta next year.
The world 110 metres hurdles record-holder said: ''Never again will I
compete in a BAF meeting while Radford is in his present job. I have
lost any respect I might have had for him. . . I can have nothing more
to do with the man or his meetings.''
But Radford has a steel core behind his soft-spoken manner. The chief
executive, Glasgow University's former professor of sports science,
called Jackson to account during the summer, incensed when the Welshman
competed in Italy just 24 hours after pleading injury as the reason for
his withdrawal from the AAA Championships in Birmingham.
Radford told him he would have to prove his fitness before going to
the world championships. The controversy got inside Jackson's head, and
he withdrew from the team, claiming pressure from Radford had
contributed to the decision.
Jackson had lengthy discussions with his management company, 'Nuff
Respect, which also handles the affairs of Linford Christie and John
Regis -- but had no contact with either sprinter -- before making
yesterday's boycott declaration.
Just 24 hours earlier, Radford had predicted: ''I think we will see
better relationships in the coming year.''
Alison Morgan, who helps manage Jackson's affairs, said she and
Jackson discussed the potential damage to his image, and the commercial
consequences. ''This is not a spur-of-the-moment decision,'' she said.
Jackson has had time to reflect while recovering from knee surgery and
a tonsils operation last month. ''I have made up my mind after the way
Radford spoke to me in his office,'' he said. ''He lectured me like a
schoolboy and virtually accusing me of lying. He had the nerve to insult
me in front of people. I went to Padua not for the money, but to find
the right race in urgent circumstances.''
He intends to winter in Australia, and spend summer in Europe. There
would be no loss of overall income but he would have to compete at the
AAA Championships in order to gain Olympic selection.
BAF said last night that they would not vindictively withhold
selection, provided Jackson does compete in the AAA meeting, which is a
stated prerequisite of selection.
The prospect of a further angry summer minus Christie and Regis, and
depleted gates, cannot be discounted, for 'Nuff Respect's policy is to
negotiate appearance packages which include all three athletes.
Ms Morgan insisted: ''Linford has been out of the country. We can't
say what his position is.'' BAF spokesman Tony Ward said: ''We are happy
to talk to Colin, but as a sport, we have always ignored ultimatums.''

PREMIER DIVISION PREVIEW:
RANGERS headed north yesterday to get ready for the third leg of a
premier division treble which might even establish them as entitled to
the ridiculously short odds which bookies offer against them winning the
title yet again.
After having beaten Celtic last weekend, then disposing of Motherwell
on Tuesday, the Ibrox lot could make it a hat trick of victories against
all of the likely pretenders to their throne in the one week.
The team at Pittodrie will have some objections to that speculation
and, indeed, have been in such good form themselves that they are
capable of winning and taking over at the top of the league.
If they did achieve that, they would confirm two theories -- that they
have put well behind them last season's relegation-threatened
aberration, and that they are genuine challengers.
So well have they been doing that manager Roy Aitken, who is not the
easiest man to please, will almost certainly stand by the same team as
has been in action in the past few games, which would mean that three
internationalists -- Duncan Shearer, Theo Snelders, and new man Paul
Bernard -- will have to sit another one out.
Said Aitken: ''I have been happy with the performances. Competition is
healthy and I now have options to change if necessary.
''This is another challenge for us, and it will be argued our biggest
test yet, because Rangers are favourites for the championship. But I
won't judge my players on this game. It is what they do over an entire
season which will count.''
Two of his players, Scott Booth and Stephen Glass, were given a timely
lift yesterday by being chosen as Bell's Player of the Month, and Young
Player of the Month respectively.
Rangers, despite the fact that they are heavily depleted because of
injury, went north in confident mood as a result of their two successive
wins. With no disrespect to Motherwell, the defeat of Celtic is what has
produced the lift in the Ibrox men's step. Brian Laudrup has been told
to rest completely for the next three weeks, a ploy that may prevent him
having any operation, Charlie Miller also is taking an enforced break,
Ian Ferguson will be out for a few weeks, but there is no further
prognosis about Paul Gascoigne and Ally McCoist.
Manager Walter Smith, who insists he will not be hurrying out to buy
players because of the injury problems, believes he still has enough
ammunition to keep the side's good run going.
For one young man it will be a special occasion. Steven Boyack, their
19-year-old defender, will be on the bench and may get his first taste
of the premier division at its most competitive. ''He is one of the most
promising of the young lads here,'' said Smith, who also has available
again Oleg Salenko, Stephen Wright, returning to his former club's
domain, and another former Aberdeen player, David Robertson.
Motherwell manager Alex McLeish felt his team were worth a point after
their second-half showing at Ibrox in midweek, and for that reason is
confident his men can overcome Raith Rovers, whose Jimmy Nicholl has
been nominated as Manager of the Month. Rovers, whose 3-0 defeat of Hibs
was their most comprehensive victory in the top division yet, may be
missing two-goal man Colin Cameron because of a knock, but Tony Rougier
could return.
Shaun McSkimming is an unlikely starter for Motherwell after having
been injured at Ibrox but Billy Davies, who was left out for tactical
reasons, could be back in the side.
Hibs defender Gordon Hunter has voluntarily relinquished his role as
team captain, handing over to Scotland keeper Jim Leighton. Hunter wants
to concentrate on getting his own game into shape after having suffered
injuries. He said: ''Jim is respected by all the players and is a
seasoned professional. The team is more important than me being
captain.''
Leighton will lead the side out against Falkirk as they attempt to
make amends for that startling hiccup at Kirkcaldy. The backlog of
injuries means that there is unlikely to be much, if any, change in the
line-up.
Falkirk have Jamie McGowan suspended as a result of his being sent off
against Celtic on Wednesday.
Kilmarnock, encouraged by their first point of the season at Firhill,
aim to go two better when they meet Hearts at Rugby Park. Manager Alex
Totten points out that four of his team's first six games have been away
from home and therefore their record may not be quite as bad as it
appears. However, he knows a victory must be collected soon. Tom Brown,
who had two stitches put in a head wound after the draw with Partick
Thistle, should be fit.
Hearts manager Jim Jefferies, who wants his side to show the same
spirit as against Hibs last Sunday, will have Gary Mackay back after
suspension and Alan Johnston a possibility after injury.

CELTIC'S attempt to snatch Dundee United midfield player Billy
McKinlay from the clutches of Blackburn Rovers is destined to fail after
the English club responded to the challenge, and are now poised to sign
the Scotland internationalist over the weekend.
The bold move by Parkhead manager Tommy Burns, who topped the English
club's bid with a #1.8m offer, had seemed certain to succeed when
McKinlay went to Celtic Park on Thursday night for signing talks.
However, it appears that the United man was not satisfied with the
terms offered, and Blackburn, it is believed, then came in with a fresh
bid, matching that of Celtic, which was accepted.
United, I understand, then gave Kenny Dalglish's club permission to
speak to McKinlay. That meeting will take place in the next 48 hours and
it is odds-on that the 26-year-old will be offered the personal deal
that will convince him to travel south.
Like all Premiership members, Blackburn have no game this afternoon,
and it may be the talks between them and McKinlay will be resolved
today. Celtic will say nothing until they hear from the player one way
or the other.
The English champions had seemed hot favourites to sign McKinlay until
Tommy Burns moved in with an offer that beat their own, but it now looks
as if the personal terms were some distance short of what the player
will be able to negotiate in England.
The Tannadice club have been aware for long enough that McKinlay wants
to leave, especially since they were relegated to the first division. He
is also pursuing a court case against the club over the long-term
contract he signed as a teenager.
Meanwhile, Burns is concentrating on the task of beating Partick
Thistle at Parkhead, and he is likely to let loose his array of young
talent once again. While #600,000 buy from Dunfermline, Jackie McNamara,
pleased his manager with a fine debut against Falkirk, he was not only
delighted but surprised by just how well full back Jamie McQuillen coped
with his first game for the top team.
''Players can stagnate a little when they have been in the reserves a
couple of years and it is always difficult when they get the chance they
have waited for. Jamie took to it like a duck to water and was very
impressive.''
With Tosh McKinlay out injured -- he will have to be withdrawn from
the Scotland B squad for Sweden next week -- McQuillen will be given his
opprtunity to play at Parkhead for the side for the first time. So, too,
will McNamara who, according to Burns, ''got better the longer the game
went at Falkirk.''
Paul McStay is back in contention for a place, but Burns indicated
that he still wants to be careful about pushing the captain too much
after his lengthy absence. The signing of McNamara was one reason Celtic
opted to let Dutch trialist Gerry Deyon go back to Holland.
''He did very well but after one reserve game and a couple of practice
matches we had to make a decision,'' said Burns.
Thistle's manager, Murdo MacLeod, makes his first appearance in the
dug-out with his new team at his old haunt, but has enough worries to
keep his attention from the spectacular stand that replaces the Jungle
of his day. Along with the bunch of injuries already hampering his
selection, he has to check on Steve Welsh, Albert Craig, and Alan
Dinnie.

AUTUMN CLASSIC
PAISLEY'S John Wither broke clear of the field to land the #5000
Assistants' Autumn Classic at Kilspindie yesterday with a five-under-par
final round of 64 edging him four shots clear, writes Matthew Lindsay.
Tied overnight with Caldwell's Craig Everett and Cawder's Alan Tait,
the 25-year-old had slipped two behind former Scottish Amateur champion
Everett with a third round of 68 in windy conditions across the short
East Lothian course. Tait's challenge faltered immediately with a
quadruple bogey 9 at the second.
But Everett closed with a 70 to tie for second spot alongside local
golfer David Drysdale and allow Wither to pocket the #750 winner's
cheque. Leading scores:
267 -- J Wither (Paisley) 68, 67, 68, 64.
271 -- C Everett (Caldwell) 66, 69, 66, 70; D Drysdale (Dunbar) 66,
72, 67, 66.
275 -- E McIntosh (Braid Hills) 67, 69, 72, 67; G Redford (Turnberry

277 -- S Henderson (Kings Links) 71, 71, 69, 66; S Thompson (Gleddoch)
73, 69, 72, 63.
278 -- K Nairn (Hilton Park) 65, 75, 68, 70; M King (Pitreavie) 69,

LEXUS TROPHY
HOLDER Liam Higgins shot three birdies in four holes on the back nine
to lie three off the pace after the second round of the Lexus Trophy
Seniors Tournament at Breitenloo, near Zurich, yesterday.
Irishman Higgins took six hours to complete his round of 70 and said
he lost concentration as the event's pro-am format caused play to be
numbingly slow.
Higgins, on five-under-par 139, is joint second with Germany-based
British professional David Creamer, who fired a 69 yesterday, and
Spaniard Antonio Garrido who returned a 68.
But that trio have plenty to do in today's final round to catch
Australia's Randall Vines, who shot an impeccable round of 66 containing
six birdies. The Queenslander, who was 50 in june and is a former winner
of the Swiss Open and 20 tournament titles worldwide, did not record a
single bogey in moving to eight under par. Leading scores (British or
Irish unless stated):
136 -- R Vines (Australia) 70, 66.
139 -- D Creamer 70, 69; A Garrido (Spain) 71, 68; L Higgins 69, 70.
140 -- J Fourie (S Africa) 70, 70.
141 -- D Butler 71, 70; V Tshabalala (S Africa) 71, 70; B Waites 72,
69; M Gregson 72, 69; J Morgan 72, 69; N Coles 71, 70; R Campagnkoli
(Italy) 69, 72.
Other scores: 144 -- T Horton 72, 72. 147 D Huish 76, 71. 151 -- M
Bembridge 74, 77.

FIRST DIVISION
BILLY Kirkwood's avowed intent to bring new faces to Tannadice moved
smoothly into gear yesterday when he signed former Rangers striker Gary
McSwegan in a #350,000 deal from Notts County.
And the Dundee United leader admitted that there were other targets,
although it seems that a move for Owen Coyle from Bolton to Tannadice is
now unlikely to take place.
The signing of 25-year-old McSwegan comes as a major boost to a player
who has been out in the cold down south. ''I had the feeling of not
being wanted at Nottingham after the new manager, Colin Murphy, came in.
He had his own ideas and wanted a more robust type of striker.
''I didn't want to spend the rest of the season in the reserves and
although there were rumours of two or three other clubs being
interested, the move to United appealed immediately.''
McSwegan goes in against Dumbarton at Boghead today in place of the
suspended Robbie Winters. Defender Steven Pressley could return after
injury, and keeper Ally Maxwell and midfielder Jim Bett also will be
back.
Airdrie have a much more daunting task against St Johnstone at
McDiarmid Park. The Perth side certainly have been giving a few sides a
lesson or two in every department, bar in front of goal.
Those damned statistics show that Airdrie have defeated the Perth
Saints only once in their past 13 meetings. Assistant manager John
McVeigh admitted: ''They seem to have the Indian sign on us.''
Airdrie, however, have at least a couple of positive things going
their way. Striker Peter Duffield, recovering from a broken arm and used
sparingly as a substitute in recent weeks, looks set to be in from the
start.
As McVeigh added: ''We are due to play our Coca-Cola Cup semi-final
against Dundee on October 25 at Perth. This will be good match
practice.''
For those with a penchant for further damned statistics, the Airdrie
assistant pointed out that every year in which they have reached a
League Cup semi-final, they had gone on to the Scottish Cup final --
1975, 1992, and last season. You have been warned.
St Johnstone have one or two knocks to sort out, as well as their
striking problems. Their assistant, John Blackley, said: ''There is
added pressure on the defence when the forwards are finding it hard to
score. Airdrie are always a stuffy team to play against, and the
pressure certainly will be on.''
The pressure is on both Hamilton Accies and Dunfermline at Firhill.
Accies manager Iain Munro admits his side are not playing at all well --
''lack of confidence rather than commitment'' -- while Dunfermline's
Bert Paton knows his first-division leaders will have to pick themselves
up from that midweek Challenge Cup doing by Dundee United.
The football should be attractive at both Dens Park and Kilbowie.
Dundee -- with Kevin Bain on a new monthly contract -- but without the
injured Dusan Vrto and Roddy Manley, will try to use their undoubted
speed to upset Jimmy Bone's St Mirren, no slouches themselves when it
comes to ''carpet'' football. Saints will miss the suspended Martin
Baker on top of their long-term injuries.
Clydebank, who last week won their first home match of the season,
take on a Morton side high in confidence after their victory at Paisley
last weekend.

BOXING
LENNOX Lewis must shoot down the ''gun shy'' theory by unloading his
full arsenal on Tommy Morrison in tonight's crucial heavyweight
encounter at the Atlantic City Convention Centre.
Caution, of course, must be Lewis' watchword in the first three rounds
when Morrison's numbing left hook will be at its most dangerous, posing
a threat to his World Boxing Council title rematch against Frank Bruno.
But once the initial storm has faded, nothing less than a dominant and
assertive performance from Lewis will do.
He must deal impressively with the ''Duke'' from Oklahoma to enhance
his marketability and provide evidence to back the claim of master
trainer Emanuel Steward that he is easily the world's best heavyweight.
Lewis' manager Frank Maloney may have overstated the case by
declaring: ''There's no way back for the loser of this fight.'' But a
defeat for Lewis in this #3m non-title fight would amount to a career
catastrophe. And has he yet exorcised the inner demons of the WBC title
defeat by Oliver McCall 13 months ago?
Morrison clearly believes that Lewis is not completely over the
knock-out by McCall. The former World Boxing Organisation champion said:
''Nobody likes getting hit. I wouldn't consider Lennox as gun shy -- you
can't be at this level -- but he fights scared. He's a scared fighter,
and sometimes they are the worst to face.
''Lewis has never been in a war, never been there like I have, doesn't
know what it's like to go through that -- and when the time comes he's
going to think it's a hell of an experience.''
Having stopped Lionel Butler in the WBC's ordered eliminator in
Sacramento five months ago, the Lewis camp will go flat out to secure a
title fight with Bruno ahead of any queue-jumping by Mike Tyson's men --
when, hopefully, Lewis uses his extra weight, height, and 7in-reach
advantage to overpower Morrison.
Steward has no doubts about his man after working almost non-stop for
the last 10 months to mould Lewis into the finished article.
He believes Tyson could not cope with Lewis Mark II, so what chance
has Morrison got in his mind?
Steward said: ''I don't think there is a heavyweight in the world who
could go eight rounds with Lennox. I believe history will put him down
as one of the best of all time. I can't see this going three rounds.''
Morrison is bound to make it hot for Lewis early on. The American may
not feel he can trust his stamina to try to stay in there over long, and
could jolt Lewis before the British hope takes over and exploits
Morrison's chin around the sixth.
* EAMONN Loughran renews rivalry with Angel Beltre at the Ulster Hall
in Belfast tonight night, insisting: ''This time there will be no
argument about the result.''
Ballymena's WBO welterweight champion plans to put the record straight
after incurring a rare blot on his career against the Dominican Republic
fighter four months ago.
A clash of heads, which left Beltre cut and unable to continue,
brought a belated ''no contest'' decision after officials had studied a
tape of the fight at ringside.
Loughran was honest enough to admit immediately that it was not his
punching power which had opened up the wound.
He kept the title -- won in October 1993 -- but it was an
unsatisfactory night's work and he relishes the chance to win cleanly
and clearly in this ordered rematch, his fifth defence.
At 25, Loughran believes he has the strength and experience to start
broadening his horizons and setting sights on better-known champions in
other divisions.
''I feel I'm ready to move on to bigger things,'' he said. ''This will
be a stepping stone after I've put the record straight.''

HOME INTERNATIONALS
SCOTLAND finished with the wooden spoon in the four- cornered women's
home international golf championship at rain-lashed Wrexham yesterday --
just three months after they were runners-up in the European team title
event in Italy.
Admittedly, they missed the services of Curtis Cup pair Janice Moodie
and Mhairi McKay who are both at university in America, but they were
still expected to do much better.
There was consolation when they edged to a 5-4 victory over Wales in
the final match, but that was too little too late after defeats by
England and Ireland.
England demolished Ireland 9-0 to win the crown for the fourth year in
a row. Wales finished second with Ireland third.
The Scotland-Wales duel was a gripping affair.
There were some splendid individual Scottish performances with Hilary
Monaghan coming back from three down to beat left-hander Bethan Jones, 2
and 1, and Lesley Nicholson who won three holes in a row on the front
nine on her way to victory over Vicki Thomas.
Another winner for Scotland -- and the most convincing of the day --
was Tain's Lindsey Roxburgh who crushed Welsh girls' champion Eleanor
Pilgrim by 5 and 4. Details:
SCOTLAND v WALES
Foursomes (Scotland names first) -- A Rose and L Roxburgh beat L
Dermott and B Jones, 4 and 3; L Nicholson and C Agnew beat E Pilgrim and
L Davis, 3 and 2; S McMaster and J Ford lost to V Thomas and D Richards,
6 and 5. Foursomes result: Scotland 2, Wales 1.
Singles -- Rose lost to Dermott, 2 and 1; H Monaghan beat Jones, 3 and
1; Roxburgh beat Pilgrim, 5 and 4; A Laing lost to Richards, 4 and 3; C
Agnew lost to Davis, 2 holes; Nicholson beat Thomas, 1 hole. Singles
result: Scotland 3, Wales 3. Match result: Scotland 5 Wales 4.
ENGLAND v IRELAND
Foursomes (England names first) -- J Hall and L Walton beat E R Power
and H Kavanagh, 1 hole; E Ratcliffe and K Stupples beat E Higgins and A
O'Sullivan, 5 and 4; E Duggleby and E Fields beat Y Cassidy and S
Fanagan, 3 and 2. Foursomes result: England 3, Ireland 0.
Singles -- Hall beat Power, 1 hole; Ratcliffe beat Kavanagh, 2 and 1;
J Oliver beat Cassidy, 4 and 3; Walton beat Higgins, 2 and 1; Duggleby
beat D McCarthy, 1 hole; Stupples beat O'Sullivan, 4 and 3. Singles
result: England 6, Ireland 0. Match result: England 9 Ireland 0.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
PETERHEAD manager Dave Watson was yesterday pondering the mystery of
the knee injury which vanished.
Blue Toon danger man Doug Baxter caused a scare ahead of today's
crucial Qualifying Cup encounter with Keith when he fell awkwardly in a
reserve match and was being carried off in agony.
Watson said: ''Doug gave us a real fright. It looked horrendously
swollen after he twisted his knee -- one of those really bad, sickening
injuries. But the next day, he was fine. It's a really strange one.''
Baxter's recovery is a real bonus before a tie which matches two of
the league's most in-form sides.
Tensions will be high in all four of today's third-round clashes, with
Scottish Cup places and a possible cash windfall at stake.
0 Keith have agreed a fee of nearly five figures for 20-year-old
Montrose midfielder Mark Garden, but he will not make a first appearance
today.
Fraserburgh will call on brothers Paul and Marino Keith to help
conquer Huntly.
Buckie Thistle will field schoolboy internationalists Mark Slater, a
16-year-old centre half, and Niall Corser, a 17-year-old striker, in
their cup clash with Lossiemouth.
Elgin City are firm favourites against unpredictable Deveronvale, who
have sweeper Steven Rattray and right back Stewart Cameron doubtful.
In the league, Clach could jump to third place with a home win over
Wick Academy.

SECOND/THIRD DIVISIONS
IS THERE no limit to the milestones Graeme Armstrong will pass before
his career comes to an end? Stenhousemuir's sweeper and assistant
manager to Terry Christie is only one month away from the first cup
final of his 21-year career, but another landmark looms before then.
When ''Louis'' -- who will be 40 next summer -- turns out for 'Muir in
today's home game against bottom dogs Montrose, he will be only one
league appearance short of No.750.
The Ochilview team should be in confident mood this afternoon, having
earned a contest against Dundee United with the Challenge Cup at stake
-- the Warriors' first participation in any cup final, other than the
Stirlingshire Cup -- through their midweek semi-final win at Stirling.
Armstrong will be more in the limelight next week at Ayr, when he
reaches that 750 mark, for today's focus will be at Berwick, where the
home club will attempt to wrest leadership of the division from their
visitors, East Fife. Steve Archibald has a deep squad of players and the
Fifers may be hard to catch over the winter unless Berwick -- or some
other team -- reel them in.
That other team could be Clyde or Stranraer, or Forfar or Stirling.
The latter two contenders meet at Station Park, where the hosts are a
handy third place in the division and hoping to make further progress at
the expense of Kevin Drinkell's team, who will have to pick themselves
up after that semi-final disappointment at the hands of 'Muir. Forfar,
incidentally, will be taking no internal action against defender Bobby
Mann, who is automatically suspended after he was given a second booking
last week for sticking out his tongue at Montrose fans during the local
derby.
Stranraer are Clyde's visitors to Broadwood, where this week the
building began of a new #1.7m 2000-seat South Stand which is expected to
be ready in April. The Bully Wee have plans to rise higher but Alex
Smith's young players need to find consistency.
Ayr United fans will find others possibly even more disgruntled than
themselves today when they make the short trip to Dumfries. Queen of the
South are a point worse off than third-bottom Ayr, with each side having
tasted league victory just once this season.
The top match in the third division will be at Dingwall, where
third-placed Ross County try to dent Livingston's unbeaten record.
Second-placed Brechin, surprisingly, have scored only the same number of
goals -- 11 -- as their visitors, second-bottom Albion Rovers, but
obviously have conceded far fewer.
Old rivals Cowdenbeath and Arbroath meet in Fife and East
Stirlingshire, denied by Alloa's late equaliser at Firs Park, again seek
their first win, with Caley Thistle being the visitors today.
It's the Spiders against the Wasps at Hampden, with Queen's Park and
Alloa each having two wins so far. Alloa have released keeper Willie
Lamont, who had just signed a one-month contract with them. Lamont, who
also has kept goal for Ayr United already this season, had been training
with Falkirk when Brockville manager John Lambie offered him a deal this
week following the injury to Tony Parks.

SNOOKER:
THAILAND CLASSIC
JOHN Parrott hit back to record a dramatic 5-4 victory over world
champion Stephen Hendry yesterday and secure his place intoday's final
of the Thailand Classic in Bangkok.
Parrott, who was 4-2 down, rattled in breaks of 57, 55, and 47 to
follow an earlier 68 as he fought back in the last three frames to shock
the hot favourite, who had never lost to the Liverpudlian in five
previous semi-finals of world-ranking events.
Overall, however, Parrott takes encouragement from a very respectable
career record of 12 wins against 17 defeats in all contests with the
Scot.
World champion Hendry, who fired in a break of 101 in the fifth frame
to follow a run of 88 in the frame before the interval, said: ''I have
not been impressive all week and played some terrible shots today.''
Even after his 5-0 win over Terry Griffiths in the semi-final the Scot
had admitted: ''I'm not as psyched up for this event as I was for the
Regal Masters at Motherwell. But to stay in that sort of mood week in,
week out, is very difficult.''
The Liverpudlian had set up the meeting with Hendry -- who last month
won the Motherwell event for the third time -- by beating another Scot,
20-year-old John Higgins, by 5-3 at the quarter-final stage.
Former world champion Parrott already has a remarkable record in
overseas events. He has won three world-ranking events on foreign soil
as well as a handful of invitation tournaments.
Parrott will now meet Derbyshire's world championship runner-up Nigel
Bond in today's final, with a first prize of #40,000 at stake.
Bond, continuing to enjoy a good year, made short work of defeating
New Zealander Dene O'Kane by 5-1 in the second semi-final.
Breaks of 55, 42, and 123 put the Englishman into a commanding lead
before the Kiwi shut him out to get off the mark at 1-3.
However, that was as close as O'Kane got, as Bond secured the two
frames he required to book his place in a second world-ranking final
this year.

EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP
TONY Cascarino and Eddie McGoldrick have forced Republic of Ireland
manager Jack Charlton to rethink his plans by pulling out of the squad
for the vital European Championship qualifier against Latvia.
Charlton had already been hit by the withdrawal of Manchester United
pair Roy Keane and Denis Irwin for Wednesday's clash at Lansdowne Road,
when the Republic must win to maintain their challenge.
Now he has added Blackburn's Jeff Kenna and Aston Villa's Steve
Staunton to the squad.
Marseille's Cascarino is ruled out by a calf injury while McGoldrick
is suffering from a hamstring problem.
''It's a game we just have to win if we are to keep alive our hopes of
playing in the finals in England next summer,'' said Charlton.
* INJURY has robbed Wales of three key players for Wednesday's
European Championship qualifier against Germany.
Strikers Ian Rush and Mark Hughes and midfielder Dave Phillips, who
all played in the 1-0 win over Moldova last month, will have to sit out
the Group 7 game in Cardiff.
* TWO Lokomotiv Sofia players have been handed two-year bans by UEFA
for attacking a referee during a European Cup-winners' Cup tie last
week.
Simeon Tchilibonov and Adalbert Zafirov were incensed when Ukrainian
referee Vasiliy Melnichuk denied Lokomotiv a penalty five minutes from
the end of the first round, second-leg tie against Sweden's Halmstad on
September 28. The pair were subsequently sent off.

WALT DISNEY CLASSIC
UNHERALDED Carl Paulson retained his lead when play was suspended for
the day during the second round at the Walt Disney World Golf Classic in
Orlando, Florida, yesterday.
Paulson picked up four birdies in 14 holes on the Lake Buena Vista
course to improve to 14 under par before play was halted due to
torrential rain at 11.25am local time. No further competition was
possible yesterday because two of the three courses used for the event
were unplayable.
Play is scheduled to resume early today, and the tournament has been
reduced to 54 holes. Nobody completed the second round, and half the
field did not even tee off.
Paulson, a US Tour rookie who is a lowly 223rd on the money list, led
by two strokes from fellow American Keith Fergus, who had completed 15
holes at Lake Buena Vista.
The diminutive, long-hitting Paulson birdied four of his first seven
holes, then reeled off seven successive pars before the siren sounded.
''I hit the ball really well all day today,'' Paulson said. ''I'd just
missed a pretty easy birdie putt (when play was stopped), so the rain
didn't hurt me.''
Ironically, the heavy downpour that flooded the Magnolia and Palm
courses missed Lake Buena Vista, where Paulson was playing. The
last-named course was still playable, but under US Tour regulations,
play must be stopped everywhere, or not at all.
''Magnolia was bad and the Palm was worse,'' said US Tour official
Slugger White. He added there was a 40% chance of thunderstorms today.
Ulsterman David Feherty, who had one hole left when play was stopped,
disqualified himself rather than return in the morning for one hole. He
was near the rear of the field at the time.

* NEW Australia coach Greg Smith has promised a return to the
Wallabies' traditional running style, following his appointment in
succession to the sacked Bob Dwyer.
Dwyer was dismissed by the Australian Rugby Football Union yesterday,
ending a seven-year reign that included winning the 1991 World Cup.
Smith, who has been appointed for a one-year term, said: ''I would
like to re-establish Australia's traditional game, and this is the
running game.''
Asked if he would make sweeping changes to the Wallaby line-up, the
new coach replied: ''I wouldn't think so. We have a very strong outfit
and it is certainly capable of going up those couple of rungs to retain
our position (of dominance) in the southern hemisphere.''
During Dwyer's two stints as national coach -- the first was in
1982-83 -- Australia played 73 tests, winning 46, losing 25, with two
draws.

THE prospect of playing all-year-round rugby sounds, on the fact of
it, like some kind of sporting heaven. The concept was raised in these
pages yesterday by Bob Jamieson, the businessman linked to the plan to
set up a semi-professional rugby league side in the Borders.
He said that players could turn out for their rugby union clubs in the
winter and then play league during the summer months. In my opinion it
would never work. If our best players are to be physically and mentally
on top of their games then what they need is less rugby, not more.
I know that some high-profile New Zealanders and Australians have
travelled the globe playing rugby for 12 months of the year for ages,
but I will also bet that if they had taken some time off then they would
have been still better players.
After a hard season of club, district and Five Nations' rugby, topped
off with a five or six-week tour or, like this year, the World Cup, then
by the time June comes around with just a couple of months until the new
season starts you just feel like having a good rest. I'm all in favour
of the International Board's intention to legislate against the 12-month
player.
Jamieson does, though, have a point about summer rugby. I don't think
you would find a player in Scotland who would argue against switching
from winter to summer just as rugby league has done.
It is just so much more fun for everybody concerned to play with the
sun on your back. That was really brought home to me in South Africa
this summer. Think, for instance, how much more enjoyable it would for
spectators if they could turn up to watch a game in shorts and shirt
sleeves, with maybe a beer and a barbecue on the side, rather than
having to wrap up against the cold and the rain.
One rugby guy who is now very definitely out in the cold is the
Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer. Bob, who I met and liked very much when we
toured Australia three years ago, has paid the price for the
Australians' inability to retain their world title in South Africa and
he has been sacked by the Australian union.
Maybe Dwyer, who was in charge for 10 seasons, had stuck around too
long and a fresh hand on the tiller was needed, but sacking the coach
or, in football, getting rid of the manager when the going gets tough,
has always struck me as a bit of a quick fix for problems which
invariably go deeper than just one man.
Within the last few years Wales have had more coaches than the Orient
Express and all the changes haven't done them much good. A coach can
only do so much and when push comes to shove it's the 15 guys on the
park who have to deliver the goods.
When Scotland went through that bleak spell with nine games without a
win the SRU stuck with Dougie Morgan. Eventually, it came good and we
challenged England for the Grand Slam. The fact of the matter is that
Dougie was just as good a coach when we were losing as he was when we
got back on the winning trail.
The knee is OK and I'm back on duty today for Stirling against
Melrose. I had to watch from the sidelines as we beat Heriot's last
weekend. That spectacting lark is tough. I'd rather face Jonah Lomu any
day.

PLANS for the rugby centre of excellence at Murrayfield are at an
advanced stage and detailed proposals for the first stage of the
ambitious development will go to the Scottish Rugby Union general
committee for approval later this month.
Ultimately, the aim is to provide, in the words of SRU rugby director
Jim Telfer, a ''unique rugby facility'' with provision for indoor
training, research, sports science, sports psychology, a library, a pool
for use in the treatment of injuries and a multi-media suite for the
production of training videos and match analysis.
In the longer term, the SRU are, according to Charlie Bisset who heads
the union's centre of excellence working party, actively exploring the
possibility of hostel accommodation and the creation of rugby
scholarships for promising players both at school and university level.
The first part of what is to be a phased development contains
proposals for the construction of a large building to accommodate an
indoor training surface.
''We envisage that it would be used not just by the national squad,
but by all age-group players as well. They would be able to work on
rugby skills under ideal conditions unaffected by the weather.
''It is also the intention to develop of series of master classes
using this facility. Jim Telfer and the national squad co-ordinator, Roy
Laidlaw, would be heavily involved and it is probable, too, that the
facilities would be available to club players with classes focusing on
specific positions,'' said Bisset.
The union is looking at various methods of funding the project. The
Scottish Sports Council and the National Lottery are two avenues being
explored and, said Bisset, they were also involved in discussions with a
number of potential commercial sponsors.
The centre of excellence, if it gets the go-ahead, will represent an
important facet in Telfer's master plan for raising the standard of the
game in Scotland.
''So far as young players are concerned, we have to provide a pathway
which accommodates their scholastic ambitions and their rugby,'' he
said.
He is only too aware, in the new professional era, of the threat
represented by big-spending English clubs who would like to entice the
cream of the playing crop south of the Border. The lessons, Rangers
aside, are there for all to see in football.
''My view is that I would prefer Scottish international players to
play in Scotland with the those presently based in England playing down
there, but that scenario has to be backed up by a framework which
satisfies the players and primarily there has to be a good, competitive
structure up here.
''This whole professionalism thing has become a real can of worms, and
forces have been unleashed that were never even thought about before.
Probably not in my lifetime, but it could well be that we will have a
transfer market for players
''On the positive side, maybe Sir John Hall's involvement at Newcastle
will concentrate the minds of the Border clubs and they might do
something about their own situation.
''The general principle of free movement of players is OK but surely,
as a nation, you should have certain principles that you stand by, and
I'd like to think that we could have a system in Scotland which would
allow the players that we produce to play their rugby in Scotland,'' he
said.
Twenty years ago, when Scotland was involved in what now seems the
fatuous debate as to whether the international side could have a
designated coach, the SRU produced a working party paper entitled
''Raising the Standard.''
The Murrayfield centre of excellence is a logical progression of the
self-improvement concept and, judging by Telfer's avowed disappointment
at the standard of club rugby this season, the standard of excellence
both physically and metaphorically cannot be raised soon enough.
''I have to admit that, on the basis of the games that I've seen this
season, I'm not too hopeful with regard to how we want to play at
national level in Scotland.
''There has been some good play but mostly, of the sides that I've
seen, there has been too much conservatism on display. Watsonians, when
I've seen them, have been very positive but most of the teams that I've
looked at could play very much better.'' And as a former director of
coaching at The Greenyards, he added: ''I include Melrose in that
category as well.''

MY contacts in Glasgow rugby tell me that Fraser Livingston has
intimated to the Glasgow committee that he is to resign from his post as
secretary to the District. Livingston heads up one of the large
surveying outfits, and has to spend more of his time in London.
But, and this is as important, what Livingston's resignation throws up
is that the days of the gentlemen amateur administrators at the higher
levels of the game are long gone.
Rugby is no longer a sport that can rely on well intentioned
individuals to lick stamps and fax details all over the world.
I also further understand that Glasgow has, in the past, asked for
help with its administration costs from the SRU but has been met with
silence. 0
In Ireland, hardly the world's most advanced rugby-playing country,
each district has its own administrative set-up, and I know that Jim
Telfer has hinted at that arriving in Scotland in the past, and those
administration arms are self funding to a point and also helped
financially by the IRFU.
It seems strange to me that rugby in the regions, at the highest
representative level, can even contemplate running itself on an amateur
basis when it comes to admin.
I think that Livingston's resignation is the start of a trend in
modern rugby that will see the administrators fight for a better deal.
One day it might have been a labour of love. These days it's just
plain labour.
* MIKE Biggar is a gentleman among some of we mere ruffians, and he
was a great player as well. It's sometimes hard for the younger
generation to accept that some of the lads who are now more than 40
could ever have been good, but Mike Biggar was one of those players who
would put himself in places that rendered his body prone to the fancy
footwork of opponents. He was ''brave.''
Mike was also the first captain that I ever played under. He had a
quiet way about him, and a pleasant authority in everything that he did.
The sad bit, as many of you will know, is that two years ago, Mike was
badly chewed up in a car smash. The good news is that next month he gets
married to Ali at Kelso Racecourse, and a huge big dinner is taking
place at Murrayfield to raise some money for him.
The English were first off the mark, and in this world of petty
nonsense and pumped up stories from nonentities, can I just remind
people that the English rugby team were wonderful providers of gifts for
that fund-raising effort.
Twickenham, yes the dreaded HQ itself, gave of their facilities for
nothing for Mike's first benefit dinner, an English charity -- Wooden
Spoon -- have been helping, and Bill Beaumont has been involved.
You know, when you think of some of the crap that flies between our
two countries, as we act like little children in a playground, it takes
some of the more human sides of life, and its undoubted perils, to bring
us together.
I find Mike Biggar's predicament distressing, in that for anyone who
has been very fit to have been struck down like this is a tragedy.
But I find warmth in it yet. I spoke to Roger Baird the other night,
and he is going to the wedding and the celebration dinner. Mind you
every great rugby player of the recent past has been invited to the
dinner.
I could be petty and say that the SRU should have been first to
organise a dinner for Mike, and maybe they should, but there is one
taking place in November at Murrayfield, 700 seats have been sold, and
there are six tables on a waiting list.
Beaumont and Willie John McBride are the speakers, and folk from all
of the countries have been putting themselves forward to help. Now I may
be a soft old twit at heart, but I think that's important.
I'll provide details at a later stage of how you can help.

CHAMPIONSHIP front-runners Melrose are about to embark upon that
middle section of the course when the clubhouse is well out of sight and
the nerve must hold, writes Derek Douglas.
Next weekend, the SRU Tennents Premiership reaches the turn and begins
rugby's equivalent of the golfing back nine. This is when the
home-and-away structure of the league will make its contribution to the
championship race, and so haphazard have been so many of the results
from the premiership thus far that it would be a brave man indeed who
would dare to predict that the first-round winners will repeat the feat
on the homeward leg.
Today, if they are to maintain the record of a single defeat at the
hands of Boroughmuir, then Melrose, at The Greenyards, must overcome the
challenge of a Stirling County side who have taken a week or three to
kick-start their campaign, but who now lie in third place, with three
wins from six outings.
A point worth noting is that Melrose have the best defensive record in
the league, conceding an average of only 10 points per game in the six
played thus far, and that, allied to the offensive firepower they can
bring to bear, makes them a formidable combination.
At the opposite end of the premiership, Gala will be at Mansfield Park
today, having conceded almost 30 points per game in their six
championship outings. They look for a win against Hawick to guide them
from the perilous ledge that leads to relegation.
Gala prop up Premiership 1, and Hawick are just two places above them.
How madly the pendulum has swung as rugby's Old Firm lock horns for the
umpteenth time this century.
* THE rugby league board of directors meeting in Leeds yesterday
considered an application in principle for the Galashiels-based Border
Reivers side to be admitted to the league. Spokesman Neil Tunnicliffe
said that despite claims by Penicuik businessman, Bob Jamieson, that he
expected the application to be rubber-stamped yesterday, no formal
application had been received and that only when a formal request had
come through would it go to the RL council for ratification.

RUGBY LEAGUE WORLD CUP
BIG guns England and Australia fire the opening shots at Wembley today
as the biggest World Cup competition in rugby league history gets
underway. The hosts and the champions clash in the opening game and, if
all goes to plan, they could be back at the same venue for the final in
three weeks' time.
Defeat for either side in today's Group 1 match would not mean a World
Cup knock-out -- just that they would need to beat South Africa and Fiji
to make sure of a semi-final spot.
But both Australia and England, first and second favourites to win the
10-nation tournament, will be keen to strike the first pyschological
blow for the overall battle that lies ahead. Australia, led by stylish
stand-off Brad Fittler, are clearly still the team to beat despite
having left Super League-bound stars like Laurie Daley and Steve Renouf
at home.
They have stumbled in past Wembley meetings with Great Britain most
noteably in the first Test of both the 1990 and 1994 Ashes series.
But the Kangaroos did emerge victorious, 10-6, at the famous stadium
in the World Cup final three years ago when they were crowned kings for
the fourth successive time.

* COLIN Paxton may look happy enough, but Hawick Harelquins have been
told that they cannot field the former Carlisle rugby league player in
their second XV game against Selkirk thirds today. SRU chief executive
Bill Hogg said yesterday that Paxton, who is out of contract and last
played for Carlisle in March, must wait until the SRU has received
chapter and verse from the IB on their new professionalism legislation.
''It will only take a fortnight or so and I have told Hawick Harlequins
that they will have to wait until then,'' he said.
Scottish IB representative Fred McLeod indicated earlier this week
that he favours a stand-down period of around 120 days before former
league players can enlist within union ranks.

ROGER Charlton can land Saturday's feature race for the second week
running courtesy of Spout at Ascot today.
Last weekend he sent Cap Juluca up to Newmarket to win the
Cambridgeshire. Stable-companion Spout faces a more straightforward task
in the #50,000 Princess Royal Stakes.
The filly runs off bottom weight and it is no surprise that Charlton
has decided to step her up to a Group Three contest after the way she
ran away with a Listed event here last month.
That was her debut over 12 furlongs and her first run on a soft
surface. In identical conditions today she can see off some exposed
rivals.
Smart Generation can fulfil the promise of his Cambridgeshire run with
victory in the Mitre Rated Stakes. He would have gone close to a place
but for a combination of trouble in running and lack of fitness after a
three-month break. He has good claims at these weights -- particularly
after the booking of top apprentice Matthew Henry.
Kevin Darley could be set for a double on the David Barron pair,
Coastal Bluff and Kunucu.
Frankie Dettori bypasses Ascot for York, where his best chance could
be on Resounder in the East Coast Rockingham Stakes.
Addington Boy is potentially the best animal in action over the jumps
today. He oozed class with a 15-length victory in a novice event at
Sedgefield on his debut over fences and Gordon Richards has found him a
first-rate opportunity to follow up at Bangor, where the trainer has a
fine record.

MUBHIJ is the form choice for the Cornwallis Stakes. He has never been
beaten more than a length in his four most recent runs and would have
added the Richmond Stakes to his successes if it had been over today's
minimum trip.
Westcourt Magic began the season in bottom-grade races and advanced
through the ranks to land a Listed race at Ayr's Western meeting.
However, he looks fully exposed now and the danger could be Ayr
runner-up Kunucu, who may have more scope.
The Princess Royal Stakes looks like a rerun over course and distance
of the Harvest Stakes, in which five of today's field took part a
fortnight ago.
Spout came out on top that time with more in hand than the winning
margin suggests and looks set for a repeat victory at 3lb better in with
most of her rivals. Saxon Maid, runner-up last time, remains a threat if
the ground softens.
Coastal Bluff took a three-month holiday after finishing second in the
William Hill Trophy and impressed on his reappearance when running Twice
As Short (2lb worse) to a close finish. He can score in today's Willmott
Dixon Handicap.
York's Coral Sprint can go to Croeso-I-Cymru. This filly has looked
most progressive since joining Reg Akehurst and followed up a cosy win
at Epsom with an admirable third in a big field at Goodwood earlier this
month. She is only 1lb higher here and appeals as the sort to keep on
improving. Course winners, Bold Effort, and Benzoe, should also be
noted.
Truancy may be sent off at an attractive price in the Rockingham
Stakes. Unsuited by seven furlongs last time, he is better judged on his
smart win at Nottingham in June and is preferred to Warning Time, who
may have been flattered by his proximity to Kuanton at Newbury.
* PETER Niven went for a precautionary X-ray on his back after a heavy
fall from Sword Beach in the three-mile handicap chase at Carlisle
yesterday. He gave up a later ride on Mr Woodcock and will also miss his
only booked mount at Hexham today.
Lorcan Wyer, who had earlier won on 9-2 shot Golden Nugget,
successfully deputised on Mr Woodcock (11-4) in the two-mile handcap
chase.
* MONDAY will be decision day for Double Trigger's bid for the
Foster's Melbourne Cup next month. Trainer Mark Johnston explained:
''The Curragh Bloodstock Agency have given us a deadline of until Monday
to make a decision about running as they have to order a container to
transport him.''
The 5-1 favourite for Australia's richest race has been a doubtful
starter since his disappointing fourth in the Prix du Cadran at
Longchamp last weekend. Mucus was found in his lungs after that race.

Darts and drink go together. For all my career I had a really good sup
before I played anyone. I have seen me having too much and that is when
my problems started
HE MAY not have been the ideal image which the sport would have
sought, but Jocky Wilson, fag in one hand, pint in the other, beer belly
and selection of chins vying for attention, was the epitome of darts'
dash to prominence in the eighties. The wee fat man from Kirkcaldy was
the champion of sloth, the athlete who wasn't, the world's best player
at the most renowned pub game of them all.
In a sense he was the corollary of all those healthy young sportsmen
and women, the dedicated followers of fitness whose finely tuned bodies
could only be envied and admired. Jocky? We could all look like that,
even if we couldn't produce the immense concentration, self-control, and
eye co-ordination needed to be expert at throwing the little winged
knife.
World champion in 1982 and 1989, Jocky made it all the way to the top
of the tree, and he did it through his own skill and buckets of booze.
No-one is more honest about his failings than Wilson, who is enjoying
a rare opportunity to appear in his own country this week in the World
Professional Team championships at Butlins in Ayr. He discusses his past
with a frankness that is exceptional among the sporting fraternity and
has none of the wha's-like-me? tendencies that often punctuate
self-analysis.
Wilson has not had a drink for nine months, a feat that perhaps
outstrips anything he ever did on that pub stage where he once conquered
all the big TV names who were at the forefront of the darts boom in the
last decade. Gone to a great extent is that memorable beer belly,
reduced by the diet that has brought him down 3st, the chins are
receding fast, and there is a non-alcoholic glow about his cheeks. He
looks five years younger than he did in his heyday and confesses he
feels it.
''I know your readers will not believe it,'' he says in that east
coast lilt, ''but I have not had a drop of alcohol since New Year. I am
also on medication for diabetes.
''It has been hard and I get nervous when I am playing, but I feel a
lot better. I didn't take heed when the doctor told me years ago to cut
the drink down, but I have now, and honestly feel the benefit. Don't get
me wrong, I still miss it.''
Wilson would tell you that at his height of fame he could not play the
pub game without enjoying the pub product. ''Darts and drink go
together. For all my career I had a really good sup before I played
anyone. I have seen me having too much and that is when my problems
started.
''It is taking me time, because if you're up there feeling nervous, it
is hard to overcome. I have not been playing very well, but I know it is
only a matter of time before I get it back.''
He acknowledges that he is one of many darts stars of his generation
who could not play without having a substantial supply of alcohol.
''That was how we learned the game in the first place -- having a drink
in the pub. Then when we started getting all the big tournaments on
television, it got so we needed the drink to calm the nerves.
''That was the way it was and 95% of the top professionals still drink
when they play. I found it bloody hard to do without it and at one point
I felt like chucking it all in. Now I am getting there gradually. I take
soda water when I play and my doctor is pleased with me.''
Wilson's hard time has coincided with the tough period that darts
itself is going through following the end of the TV boom, which also
brought about a split between the British Darts Association and the top
players, who, along with their managers, felt that the ruling body was
not doing enough to maintain the sport's prominence.
Jocky's manager, Tommy Cox, points out that in 1988 there were 11
tournaments on terrestial TV, yet by 1991 there was only one left. A
year later the row became a rift and now the breakaway group, the World
Darts Council, is suing the original body for restraint of trade, a case
that will come to court next year.
In the interim, the star turns -- like Wilson and Bristow and Taylor
and Lowe -- have had to suffer a severe dent in their earnings, as they
are ineligible for the major competitions run by the the BDO, including
the Embassy World championships on BBC.
''Thankfully, we still have exhibition work and appearances for the
brewers to rely on,'' said Wilson, ''but I know for myself it has been
very difficult to earn a living.''
Part of that, by his own admission, is his spendthrift nature. He did
make big money during his peak period but saving was not part of the
Wilson game plan.
''I spent the lot,'' he says,'''but I had a lot of fun and, let's face
it, I was all over the world. I am not broke now, but I am not far from
it. Hopefully, I will get back up there again. To be honest, I am just
happy that I am still in the top 16 and get invited to tournaments.''
He also makes the valid argument that, had he not been a darts player,
he would have been a labourer, which he used to be, and unlikely to have
enjoyed the life-style that became his norm. ''I also worked in the
pits, but I would have been out of a job now, wouldn't I?''
Born in St Andrews, Wilson was a Rangers fan and then coupled them
with Raith Rovers when he settled there. It was in Lister's Bar in the
town that he became proficient at darts and drinking, and it was the
late proprietors, Mr and Mrs Blyth, who sponsored him in his early days,
and he has never forgotten their generosity.
The medication he receives, he contends, is inclined to make him feel
a little depressed, but then he brightens up and insists: ''If people
knew how bad I was at one time and what I have come through, they would
understand better.''
The extent of his addiction may be judged by a remark made by his
manager when he pointed out that Jocky had reached the final of a
competition in Antwerp recently. ''That was the first time for years
that he had made it that far. Usually he had drunk too much by the
quarter-finals to have any chance.''
Cox also recalled that, in Antwerp, Jocky had gone out on the town
with the lads, stood his round, and never touched accohol all night. ''I
tell you, every one of them is amazed at what he has done and I will
tell you another thing, they couldn't do it.''
Wilson is optimistic that his sport will come back to prominence,
although maybe not to the heights it once reached. ''There were times
when we played every night at a pub or club and there would be 400-500
folk in every night. Looking back on it, I wish I hadn't been drinking
then, and now had the money I spent.''
His long-suffering wife, Malvina, is still with him 27 years on and he
has three children. ''They have put up with a hell of a lot, but I love
my wife and even at my worst I wasn't much of a drinker at home. I got
enough on the road.''
One of his major regrets in this period of ''exile'' is that he cannot
play for Scotland. ''I loved playing for my country, although I was a
disgrace in Finland the last time. The drink was stronger there than
here. I drank too much and could have played a lot better.''
He has no bitterness about the pictures that depicted this portly
figure with the pint and fag celebrating victory. ''Why should I object?
I did drink and smoke, so why be annoyed? There's quite a few who
wouldn't be photographed taking a drink, but not me. I was getting stuck
in, anyway.''
He is happy to see Raith Rovers getting stuck in, too. ''Jimmy Nicholl
is doing a great job and I wish him all the best in Munich.'' Wilson
played football and -- believe it or not -- cricket at school in
Anstruther, and has always been a sports fan.
He looks forward with hope and a little conviction. ''I can see us
getting bigger as a group and attracting bigger prize money. My future
has to be darts and I don't know if I can be as good ever again, but as
long as I can make a living I will be content. I am certainly going to
give it a try.''
He is proud to remember that he was Scotland's No.1 for a long time.
''I could have been better, I know that, but I drank too much.
''I have done a lot of daft things, but at the end of the day I have
thoroughly enjoyed my life. How many people can say that?''
He sups his coffee, looks at me through spectacles that give him a
serious, academic appearance, bids me farewell, and heads off for
practice. Jocky Wilson has been a winner and a loser, but always a
trier.

AN Olympic gold medal, linked to Scotland's first and most prolific
Olympic athletics medallist, Arthur Robertson, goes up for auction later
this month.
From the 1908 London Olympiad, it is attributed to Wilfrid Coates, who
owes the medal to the efforts of Robertson, son of a Glasgow doctor, and
Joseph Deacon. Between them they combined to win the three-mile team
gold.
Robertson, educated at Kelvinside Academy, finished second in the
race, collecting individual silver. Robertson also took silver in the
3200m steeplechase -- the only Scot to win three athletics medals at the
same Olympics.
That same year, Birchfield Harrier Robertson set a world record for
5000 metres, and a Scottish four-mile record (19-45.2) at the Ibrox
Sports which lasted for 45 years.
Only three other Scots -- James Wilson, of Greenock Glenpark (above),
Eric Liddell (1924), and Allan Wells (1980), have won two athletics
medals at the same Olympiad.

WHEN they heard that Sir William Lithgow would attend the opening
ceremony for their new clubrooms, members of Greenock Glenpark Harriers
were horrified. Not only had much of the raw materials been pochled from
his shipyard, but some items still bore the Lithgow name, stamped
ostentatiously -- doubtless to prevent theft!
The members, who had taken three years to build the brick structure,
thrashed themselves to a frenzy in the next 24 hours, painting over the
company's name.
That was back in 1958, and Glenpark will paint Greenock red tonight,
celebrating their centenary (Scotland's eighth club to do so), marking
the occasion with a dinner in the Tontine Hotel.
There is much to recall, including the pre-1955 clubrooms, a wooden
lean-to against a tenement wall. The owner, a Miss Kirkwood, promised
she would gift the ground if they built better premises. The site was
occupied by a huge tree, which was felled, chopped into firewood, and
sold round the doors to raise building capital.
One member, saxophonist Duncan McFarlane, had a band which played
every Saturday in Rankine Park Community Center, also funding the
project. But when the Cardiff Empire Games Appeal was launched, the club
donated one night's profits of #87-00s-10d to the fund -- the largest
amount from any club in Scotland.
When bolts were needed, Lithgow's stores were approached. The storeman
refused to count out the 37 needed: ''Just take a gross.'' The steps at
the hall are reinforced by dozens of seven-inch bolts -- nothing was
wasted! ''Apparently, scarcely a lorry left the yard without some item
for Glenpark,'' says club historian, Colin Shields.
One member, Duncan Mill, was chosen for the inaugural World
Cross-country Championship, at Hamilton racecourse in 1903. But Mill
broke a toe in a shipyard accident, and had to withdraw. A year later,
however, he was a member of the Scottish team which finished second to
England at Haydock Park.
Another notable stalwart was George Wallach, twelfth of 18 children,
who died in 1979, aged 96. Wallach began running late, aged 28, but won
eight Scottish cross-country vests from 1910 to '24. He clocked a
remarkable 53 minutes for 10 miles on cinders in 1913, and when he won
the national cross-country title for the second time, in 1922, aged 40,
he set a record yet to be broken -- the oldest man ever to win the
Scottish title.
A year later, in finishing fourth, he led Glenpark to their only
national team title. His granddaughter still lives in Ayr, and treasures
all his medals, solid gold, in the tradition of the day.
Only in 1989, 67 years after Wallach's win, did Tommy Murray win the
club's second national cross-country title.
Glenpark can claim to be the first Scottish club with a double Olympic
medal-winner. James Wilson, first Scot to win the world cross-country
title, in 1920, also set national four, seven, eight, nine, and 10-mile
records in the same race. In the 10,000 metres at the Amsterdam Olympics
that year, he finished third to Paavo Nurmi. The next Briton to win a
medal in that event was Brendan Foster, who took bronze 56 years later.
Finn Nurmi also won the cross-country (no longer an Olympic event),
with Wilson in fourth place and helping Britain to team silver.

AMERICAN FOOTBALL
THE Scottish Claymores begin their campaign for World League glory in
Glasgow tomorrow when head coach Jim Criner oversees his club's search
for Scottish gridiron talent.
The first of two Scottish player trials will be held from 9am on
Strathclyde University's playing fields at Stepps with around 70 players
expected to attend from all over Britain.
Scottish national coach and Claymores' assistant Michael Kenny will
also be on hand to select players for a possible amateur Scotland side.
The Claymores, who finished their inaugural season in the World League
with a disappointing 2-8 record, must include seven ''national'' players
as part of their final 45-man squad.
Players on the east coast will get their chance to try out for the
Murrayfield-based outfit next Sunday at Edinburgh's Meadowbank Stadium.
The six-team World League is scheduled to kick-off its fourth season
next April.

ATHLETICS
LIZ McColgan will rely on male opposition for help when she races 10
miles for the first time tomorrow in Portsmouth's Great South Run.
Kate McCandless and Suzanne Rigg, Americans resident in Britain, are
her strongest female rivals, but McColgan, chasing her third victory in
as many weeks, says: ''I prefer to run with men -- it gives me something
to race against.''
The Dundee woman who won the Great North Run half-marathon last month,
and the Great Caledonian 10,000 metres last weekend, adds: ''I never
raced 10 miles before, but when I ran the world half-marathon best in
Tokyo three years ago, I went through 10 miles just inside 51 minutes --
faster than the British record.'' That stands to Jill Hunter at 51-40.
Depending on how close she can get, McColgan and coach Grete Waitz
will know if Liz is on course for the Tokyo Marathon on November 19.
* THERE will be a public meeting in Greenock Town Hall at 7pm on
Thursday to discuss the formation of Inverclyde's new track and field
athletics club.

TENNIS:
GREAT Britain completed their first hat trick of victories in the
Maureen Connolly Challenge when Kate Warne-Holland, Mandy Wainwright,
and Lucie Ahl established a 7-1 winning margin after yesterday's second
day of this annual 21-and-under women's fixture against the USA at the
Scotstoun Leisure Centre, Glasgow.
Warne-Holland added to the 4-0 lead established on Thursday but needed
almost two-and-a-half hours to dismiss 17-year-old Traci Green. The
20-year-old from Stockport whose world ranking has improved over 300
places this year to a current 357, made a dream start to her British
debut with a 7-5, 4-1 lead, but ''nerves and lack of experience'' got
the better of her. The Philadelphia High School student reeled off six
of the next seven games to pocket the second set 7-5. The British No.9
took advantage of two double faults to gain a crucial break in the fifth
game of the final set and went on to clinch the match 7-5, 5-7, 6-4.
Karen Cross followed Warne-Holland on to court and 59 minutes later
the Devon left-hander had gifted the United States their first victory
when she lost 6-1, 6-4 to Sandy Sureephong.
Rachel Jensen, the assistant US team coach, said this result ''kept
the dream alive.'' Less than an hour-and-a-half later the dream was
over.
Wainwright outplayed Farley Taylor to give Britain a 6-1 winning
margin. The 19-year-old from Chingford set up a 6-3, 3-0 lead before the
20-year-old psychology student fought back to serve for the second set
at 5-4. But Wainwright's policy of ''getting on top of the ball and
hitting out'' paid off and she saved a set point in the tenth game with
a ferocious forehand return and dropped just three further points in as
many games as she recorded a 6-3, 7-5 success.
The British No 7, who has 10 wins out of 11 matches in her four
appearances in this fixture, said: ''From the very first ball I just
knew it was going to be my day. To play like that and win the trophy for
Britain was just wonderful.''
Ahl added to Britain's tally when she completed a 6-3, 6-2 win over
Marissa Catlin in the final match of the day. Today's order of play (GB
names first):
Karen Cross v Kristin Sanderson; Lizzie Jelfs v Sandy Sureephong;
Cross and Jelfs v Traci Green and Farley Taylor.

GRAEME Obree's bid to regain the world one-hour record next weekend
has been axed and his Olympic aspirations may put long-term prospects of
attacking it on ice.
Scotland's newly-crowned world 4000 metres pursuit champion was
scheduled for Manchester Velodrome a week today, and an attempt to
recapture the hour record now held by Tony Rominger.
Despite the presence of Obree, Rominger, and Olympic pursuit champion
Chris Boardman, the meeting has been cancelled. Because of over-pricing,
insufficient seats have been sold.
''Perhaps that's a blessing,'' said Obree, speaking from Colombia last
night. ''Because of the rarified air here, your muscles get starved of
oxygen and can't maintain their power output. Consequently, I've started
losing muscle strength.
''The record is so close to human limits I'd need months to prepare.
With the winter six-day races, that is impossible. It may be impossible
next year too, because I can't let anything interfere with the Olympic
Games.''

UNITED Auctions, who earlier this week survived an attempt by
investment company Guinness Peat to acquire a substantial interest in
the company, have announced plans for a major development at their
Stirling market, writes ROBERT ROSS.
A planning application has been submitted to Stirling District Council
to change the use of the present mart site to retail, housing, and
leisure purposes. The money realised from that development would be used
to finance the construction of a new state-of-the-art market to the rear
of the existing Kildean premises.
Alan Watson, managing director at Kildean, said: ''If our plans work
out United Auctions will own and operate one of the most modern marts in
the UK.
''If planning permission is not forthcoming we have contingency plans
to continue up-grading Kildean to ensure that our customers and their
livestock have the best possible facilities.''

<HEADLINE>EU rejects claims over chilled lamb. Imports fromNew Zealand</HEADLINE>

BRUSSELS farm trade officials have rejected claims that tighter
controls on imported chilled lamb are needed to prevent New Zealand
supplies disrupting the European Union market, despite evidence that the
tonnage is increasing significantly.
Members of the sheepmeat management committee which authorises
measures to regulate the union's market have been assured there is no
reason to fear instability under the new, relaxed import regime in place
since July.
According to an MLC report of the most recent meeting, European
Commission officials told the committee they saw ''no reason for
concern'' but were monitoring the trade closely.
Although it was acknowledged the flow of chilled lamb from New Zealand
was growing, the increase was said to be no bigger than had been
expected when quota restrictions were loosened three months ago as a
consequence of the Gatt international farm trade deal.
The relaxed attitude of the Brussels officials is likely to make UK
sheep industry leaders uneasy. Some, notably John Thorley of the
National Sheep Association, are known to sympathise with Irish lobbyists
who claim the European Commission is under-estimating the competitive
threat from New Zealand.
One apparently minor decision by the management committee hints that
the worries expressed in Ireland are at least partly justifiable.
Irish farmers' representatives point to Finland for an example of
alleged destabilisation by increased imports. They claim a single
containerload of New Zealand lamb wrecked the newly-opened Finnish
sheepmeat market shortly after that country joined the EU.
The latest management committee meeting agreed a special, though
small, subsidised private storage scheme for sheepmeat in Finland.
It is hard to find any other signs of imports causing trouble in the
lamb trade, even though the volume of imports coming into the British
market has been much bigger than last year.
Latest Customs figures, covering the New Zealanders' main selling
season in the UK, show the tonnage about 15% greater than in 1994. As
the home-killed lamb price is stronger than a year ago, it is clear
these imports have not harmed British producers' returns.
However, the total import tonnage statistics mask the potential threat
to sheep farmers in this country.
Most of the imported sheepmeat is frozen lamb and mutton, which all
sides of the trade agree is of only peripheral relevance to home
producers.
The official figures do not identify separately the chilled lamb -- a
much higher value commodity which can compete directly against UK fresh
lamb.
Wholesalers point out that the chilled lamb should not worry anyone at
this time of the year anyway. The New Zealanders are thought unlikely to
be interested in wasting such a high-cost product at a time of year when
the British market price is near its seasonal low point.
The real test of the European Commission officials' judgment is seen
as likely to come next spring, when home producers could normally expect
to enjoy a buoyant market for the first new season lambs.
Undisciplined marketing by the New Zealanders might, so their critics
claim, do serious damage then by creaming off the premium-price business
-- and do it even on surprisingly small tonnages.

GRAEME Torrance insists: ''I am not an anorak.'' Nor, he says, is he
''a gricer''. Apparently gricers are the slow-lane, bus-shelter
equivalents of train spotters. Torrance has been 17 years in the bus
industry, and his vision of heaven is a clean environmentally-friendly
bus, full of passengers, with even more waiting at the next stop.
Despite the undoubted high-profile success of Stagecoach, FirstBus and
some others, the operational economics of the British bus industry have
remained something of a mystery to me.
Buses draw much of their custom from the young, the old, the carless
and the poor. Demand for their services is lumpy, with two daily peaks
and hours of carrying lots of fresh air around. Modern buses cost
upwards of #100,000 apiece. In the deregulated industry of today with
everyone competing fiercely on the lucrative routes and trying
desperately to invent new ones, it seems as much a recipe for losing
money as for making it.
''The bus industry is a really dynamic and exciting industry. It has
everything,'' claims Torrance who, since last November, has been
managing director of Clydeside Buses.
In its previous guise, Clydeside 2000, the business had been through
the depths. One minute after it was privatised, in October 1991, as part
of Western Scottish, it became a separate employee-owned company. In
somewhat acrimonious circumstances some 600 of its 850 employees bought
shares.
But the business lost money in 1991-92, and again in 1992-93. ''It
lost mega amounts in 1993-94,'' adds Torrance, unspecifically. There
was, he argues, too much trade union involvement. Everything was done by
committee.
Maintenance standards were poor and reinvestment low. Buses weren't
turning up when they were scheduled. Customers were increasingly
neglected. In June last year, there was a public inquiry on the
company's poor maintenance record. It was told that, if improvements
were not forthcoming within a year, its operator's licence would be
curtailed.
Then, on September 18 last year, a Clydeside 2000 bus was involved in
the horrific accident on Glasgow's West Street when three Drumchapel
guides and two of their leaders died.
An English bus company, Luton &amp; District, had a 20% stake in Clydeside
2000. By the summer of 1994, Luton was part of British Bus, the
Salisbury-based number two in the industry then, now the number three
because of the merger which created FirstBus.
By October last year, British Bus emerged as the only credible bidder
for Clydeside 2000. Torrance was on his way north to sort it out. He
was, as it happens, coming home. An accountancy and economics graduate
of Strathclyde University, he had always wanted to work somewhere in the
transport sector.
Starting as a senior management trainee for the National Bus Company,
he worked in North Wales and, later, for Eastern Scottish at Bathgate,
went back to England, then returned to Eastern. ''You've got to get
about in this industry to get on,'' he insists. ''Otherwise you get
stale.''
Increasingly he specialised in the traffic side of management and,
before being sent to Clydeside's Thornliebank main depot, he was first
traffic and commercial director, then managing director of Southend
Transport.
In answer to my queries about the economics of this puzzling industry,
he says: ''It's easier to cut costs to make a profit in this industry
than it is to generate extra revenue.''
Employees are down from 830 to 690. Historic but costly working
practices have been reformed. Dead wood layers of management have been
pruned. Old expensive covered depots are being closed and the buses
moved to cheap and cheerful open sites with a couple of workshop bays.
The business is back in the black.
With that return to profitability, Torrance has been able to convince
his parent company to invest in new buses -- 32, so far, in a 280 bus
fleet -- which are cheaper to run, more comfortable and reliable. It is
easy to forget that even a relatively small bus company generates
significant daily cash flow. In Clydeside's case this amounts to 30
million passenger journeys a year and a turnover of #15m, two-thirds of
it in hard cash passed to the driver.
Torrance admits the transition has created some tension and hostility.
He says sacking people gave him some sleepless nights. ''But we can't
afford to carry passengers, except on our buses,'' he says pointedly,
although he claims to believe in trade union involvement and collective
bargaining.
Clydeside is currently moving out of the Thornliebank depot, which it
rented from Western, now part of Stagecoach. The five-acre site is
destined to become a nursing home complex. Torrance, 39, his two fellow
executives, aged 35 and 31, and their 11 headquarters support staff are
moving to a floor of offices in the Babcock complex at Renfrew.
He admits that growing revenue is a big challenge. ''If we provide a
more attractive service we'll win more than we lose,'' he insists. His
thoughts are also turning to limited diversification. The driver
training school can be used to teach HGV and forklift drivers. There are
opportunities for tour and holiday business, and joint promotions with
stores and commercial radio stations.
''If I can make money selling hamburgers on the Largs prom, I'll do
it,'' he adds.

THIS week's trailblazing entrepreneur is the founder and managing
director of Datalap Racing Systems. And very shortly this new company's
unique product will be blazing a trail round the kart race tracks of the
world. In the fiercely competitive arena of kart racing, fine-tuning of
the kart gives the ambitious driver the winning edge. Datalap was
established and its racing system designed to give the information
necessary to sharpen the performance of karts in competitive racing.
Using powerful state-of-the-art electronic components and innovative
design within an easy to use dedicated computer package, it provides the
driver with a mass of statistics on different aspects of his or her
performance -- the engine gearing and revs, fuel mixture and track
widths, particularly at the all-important entrances and exits to each
segment of the lap.
The company was established by Brian Harrison in 1994 and in the
spring of this year it won an Award for Technology from the Glasgow
Innovation Fund. It is based in Govan, and with help from Govan
Initiative, Datalap Racing Systems is now at production stage. Its
manufacture has been sub-contracted to a Scottish electronics firm.
Harrison has been involved in racing all his life, and, he says, he's
always been an ideas man. (Innovative shoelace packaging, powered
hang-gliders, microlight aircraft, windmill generators and even the
eventually doomed replica Healey sports car have all had the benefit of
input from his fertile brain.) So Datalap represents the coming together
of two important aspects of his life, and judging by the response he has
had already, it should be a very profitable union.
The world market for his system is vast, and enthusiasm for kart
racing is growing rapidly. Not only is it seen as a more accessible,
cheaper and safer substitute for motor-racing, but it is also a
significant sport in its own right, its popularity rising as more indoor
circuits appear. At the same time satellite TV coverage of the European
and World Kart Championships is contributing to awareness of the sport.
Its worldwide popularity means there are a huge number of very
competitively minded kart club racers who, at the top end, are spending
between #20,000 and #50,000 on their sport per season. Anything which
gives a club cart an edge is going to be eagerly snapped up.
Harrison saw all this clearly as over several years he watched his son
becoming more and more involved in kart racing. And he realised that
improved performance required detailed information on a wide range of
factors at different stages of the track. Until now, adjusting the
functioning of one might improve performance at one stage, but detract
from it at another. Trial, error and guesswork were the only available
means of attempting to improve track times.
Last summer the breakthrough came when a friend and electronics design
consultant, Brian Douglas, came upon a powerful chip from the US. It
could be programmed to interpret the mass of information coming from the
vehicle at the entrance and exit to each part of the lap. During the
following months Harrison and Douglas worked together to produce a
prototype -- a video cassette-sized product which could be installed in
any kart in 10 minutes, which required no sophisticated computer
knowledge to use and could not only display important information
instantly on the steering column but would produce print-outs at the
pits.
Harrison took his prototype to the International Auto Sport Show at
the NEC and was delighted with the reaction. Now, he says, his main
effort lies in marketing. He expects 80% of his output to be exported:
Italy, Belgium and Australia all have huge potential markets; motorsport
distributors in France have already expressed a keen interest, and he is
taking the system to Le Mans and the US.
At the same time his marketing strategy involves creating and
maintaining a high profile, desirable image for his system. He is
confident that when kart racers see the improved performances of fellow
competitors they will want his racing system, too. And at a cost of just
over #500, he reckons it will soon pay for itself through savings in
terms of tyre and engine wear and the reduction in track-testing time
fees.
As for Datalap Racing Systems, it will pay for itself by the time it
has won a quarter of 1% of the international kart market. After that, it
will be blazing an entirely profitable trail as it roars round the race
tracks of the world.

WILL North Bridge, Edinburgh home of our east-coast rival The
Scotsman, be turned into the Scottish Ritz? Or will newsroom and
features staff have to part their hair -- if they have any left -- to
opposite sides of their heads in future?
Such insistent questions are prompted by clear evidence that the
principals behind the Deutsche Morgan Grenfell bid for the Thomson
Corporation's Scottish newspaper titles are none other than the Barclay
twins, the intensely secretive and immensely wealthy owners of The
European.
The identical but rarely pictured pair -- distinguishable only, 'tis
said, by left/right hair partings -- snapped up The Ritz in London
yesterday, paying Trafalgar #75m for the privilege.
Indications are that they may be prepared to pay up to #200m for The
Scotsman, the Press &amp; Journal and Thomson's other Scottish titles,
seriously outbidding other suitors, including the Daily Mail's local
newspaper arm, Northcliffe.
Why? Well, although London born, David and Frederick Barclay are of
Scottish descent. According to one diary source, who met one of the
twins recently on a luxury train, they are still brave at heart.
The pair, who first made money in the London property market of the
late fifties and early sixties and played a role in the Crown Agents
saga, are now significant property and hotel owners around the globe.
They also own a slice of Sir Tim Bell's PR business. One of their big
eighties' coups was the purchase of the Ellerman Line. The Barclays are
said to be worth at least #500m today and are among the 20 richest
people in the land.
They are, in fact, resident in Monte Carlo, but are currently building
their very own Xanadu, a massive modern castle on Brechou, a tiny island
off Sark in the Channel Islands.
This too is supposed to be a secret. The Guernsey Evening Press is
already on the receiving end of a writ from the Barclays for publishing
detailed plans of the new palace. Pass the combs, lads.
Americans can
see you Jimmy
MacROBERTS partner David Flint, who is a bit of a whiz on the internet
reckons that a Scottish exile must be hard at work on a computer in
California.
Flint was studying the operating manual of new system from SCO
California when he came across the following instruction to call up a
system called jimmy. It was simply cu jimmy. He told me: ''Whoever wrote
it must have been a Glaswegian with a sense of humour.''
Enchanted by
house opening
IT was a fairytale come true for Alice Parsons, wife of Colin Parson,
chairman of the Taylor Woodrow Group, when she opened the company's new
housing development Semple View in Howwood, Renfrewshire.
She was born and brought up in the nearby village of Glengarnock, and
as a little girl she passed the site on her way to Glasgow by bus.
According to her husband, she was fascinated by the Castle Semple
building which sits on top of the hill overlooking the site, and
imagined it was an enchanted castle.
Expensive taste
souvenirs
BUSINESS Diary hears that there is a run on Clydesdale Bank #20 notes
which feature Robert The Bruce. It seems American tourists in Edinburgh,
carried away with the romance of the films Braveheart and Rob Roy, are
asking for the notes so they can take them home as souvenirs. All I can
say is that it's one heck of an expensive souvenir.
Baby, Daddy's
counting on you
CONGRATULATIONS are in order for Fred Goodwin, the likeable deputy
chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank, whose wife Joyce has just had a
baby boy.
The name of the new baby, the couple's first, is yet to be decided,
but Goodwin did not think it would be helpful when I suggested we run a
competition to get readers' suggestions.
The changeover to metrics has obviously passed him by, as when asked
the weight of his son he replied: ''Eight pounds three ounces.'' Tut,
tut, you should have said 3.709 kilograms.
It is too early to say if Baby Goodwin will follow in his father's
footsteps and become a banker, but the signs are good. He arrived at
5.30pm just as the banks closed, and the first thing his father can
recall after the birth is the Clydesdale Bank's School Quiz on Radio
Clyde wafting across the labour room.
Guess who's
coming to lunch
FEW people can say that they have beaten the Ally McCoist and Walter
Smith team but Des O'Donnell, business development partner for surveyor
DM Hall, can claim just that.
The O'Donnell victory came at a charity auction during the Variety
Club of Great Britain event at Hamilton Race Course. The chartered
surveyor, who is based at DM Hall's Hamilton office, was surprised when
he beat Super Ally and his manager with a bid of #140.
Though it is perhaps not surprising he won when you consider that the
prize was a lunch with Scotty McClue, the Scot FM presenter whose
phone-in programme has gained something of a cult following.
The Rangers pair may have taken fright when they saw a lunch with
Scotty looming up. But O'Donnell, who has still to arrange the meal,
told Business Diary. ''I knew he was a character, and I thought it would
be interesting. The main thing was that it was for a good cause.'' Enjoy
your lunch.
Getting down to
serious kissing
THEY certainly have a sense of humour at Glasgow Chamber of Commerce,
and it is kept alive by some of the correspondence they receive.
The latest communication to raise eyebrows emanated from Bayer, the
German chemical and pharmaceutical company. Headlined ''When a Kiss is
Not Just a Kiss'', the article in its new publication, Chemistry and
Chlorine, describes how some scientists believe our ancestors had a more
practical reason for kissing than merely showing affection.
They claim they exchanged kisses in order to satisfy their instictive
need for salt! Or, ''to be more scientifically correct, we should say to
satisfy their need for sodium chloride. The lips and cheeks of loved
ones provided prehistoric man with a daily source of a few milligrams of
salt, and the erotic sensation derived from kissing was just an
extremely pleasant by-product.''
When it was pointed out to James Carson, editor of the Glasgow
chamber's journal, that to obtain more information on the subject he had
to contact Andrew Craven, his comment was: ''There's a lot of it
apout.'' Oh dear.
Beware, snakes
in the grass
CAMPBELL Smith, head of Corporate Law at Biggart Baillie &amp; Gifford,
has had an altercation with a snake, and ended up in hospital to receive
an antidote.
Not altogether surprising you might think for someone who has just
returned from an extended holiday which took in Hong Kong, Malaysia and
Tonga, as well as Australia, New Zealand and Canada. However, the sting
in the tail is that Smith was bitten nearer home while taking part in a
sponsored walk on the West Highland Way.
He was attacked by an adder en route to Fort William. Not realising
that he had been bitten, he and his daughter, Emma, completed the walk
and returned home to Glasgow. The following day his leg started to swell
and he felt unwell. As a result he spent five days in Glasgow's Victoria
Infirmary.
Smith, who has a sense of humour, returns to his office on Monday
where there has been, we are told, some amusement about the incident.
Staff have been heard making hissing noises, and comments have been made
about snakes in the grass.
Business Diary was going to suggest he should put his foot down and
stamp out this nonsense, but that might not be such a good idea.
Mr Happy gets
some company
GLASGOW'S Mr Happy might be slightly worried to hear that a new city
logo is about to arrive in town -- the Glasgow/Dalian symbol specially
created to mark the arrival of the 90-strong trade mission from Dalian
in China.
The delegation will arrive on October 22 led by Mayor Bo Xllal, and
throughout the four-day visit banners incorporating the logo, which
consists of a jade-coloured dragon, a symbol of good luck to the
Chinese, will be hung in George Square.
While in the city the delegation will be staying at the Moat House
Hotel, where manager Campbell Aird has agreed to fly flags with the logo
to welcome his guests. Glasgow has had links with Dalian, which is a
seaport with a population of more than five million, since 1987.

ARE you surprised when you buy a few shares to find how much appears
on your contract note as expenses? Dealing expenses are a hot topic and
pressure is mounting again for the Government or the Bank of England, or
maybe even both, to do something to cut the cost for the small investor.
The Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers
(APCIMS) is sailing into battle with CrestCo, the Bank of England-run
operation which is bringing in a new electronic system for transferring
and registering shares. The broker body has sent the Crest company a
comprehensive criticism of its proposed charging structure.
But it also wants the Government to keep its promise to drop the hated
stamp duty levied on share deals. Even if you spend a relatively modest
#1500 on shares the Government will take #8 in stamp duty. It had
promised to abolish the duty when Taurus, the system which was scrapped
before it started to be superseded by Crest, became operational. The
Crest software designers did not at first make any provision for
collecting stamp duty. However, it is now understood the Treasury has
told them they should build in the facility for collecting it.
APCIMS, which argues that Crest should inherit the promise given to
Taurus, says that in any case if Crest insists on its present charging
proposals the Treasury should at least step in to help the smaller
investor by scrapping stamp duty on deals involving less than #10,000.
APCIMS chairman John Cobb in his attack on the proposed Crest charges
says the tariff is ''blatantly unfair''. It particularly hits investors
who want to keep their own share certificates. The Stock Exchange when
it was promoting Taurus used to say that small investors would prefer
not to have to worry about looking after their own share certificates.
But APCIMS chief executive Geoffrey Turner says: ''Our members find
there is little enthusiasm for people to give up their certificates.
People who retain them will be discriminated against, although the
Governor of the Bank of England said they would not be.''
Mr Turner recalls the Governor saying in May that it was important the
total costs of paper transactions should not be higher under Crest than
they were before it. APCIMS also says the Government undertook that no
one set of investors would be able to advance its interest at the
expense of others, but it claims this is not the case as ''individual
investors lose out while institutions gain''.
This is because the proposed Crest charges are worked out on the
principle of ''user pays''. So, as it takes the same amount of computer
time to process a #1000 deal as it does for a #1m one, each will bear
the same charge.
''Not fair,'' cries APCIMS, maintaining that the Government, which
will have the responsibility for licensing Crest to operate, ''has a
duty to ensure private investors are given a fair deal and that the
tariff is adjusted''.
The argument is that part of the Crest operation deals with
guaranteeing that when the deal comes to be settled, currently on the
fifth day after it is made but before very long on the third, the money
will be there. So even if the small deal uses up the same amount of
computer electricity as the big one, the latter has more risk taken care
of and, therefore, should pay more.
In a highly challenging document APCIMS, which speaks for 130 member
firms, questions some of the calculations made by the Crest company of
the likely costs. Criticising one analysis of figures provided by six
retail broking firms, which Crest suggested showed four would be better
off under its proposals and two worse off, APCIMS comments: ''Our
figures suggest that all six will be worse off.''
One of the problems highlighted is the likely cost of networking
involved in sending the electronic messages which have to go to Crest
for a deal to be processed. These are not under Crest's direct control,
but Mr Turner complains that figures provided by it ''seem likely to
prove a major underestimate''.
Member firms have already begun telling the two networking
organisations that they do not like the look of their charges.
Both Crest and network charges have to be paid by brokers when they
transact a deal and, as with the cost of providing nominee services for
investors who no longer want to keep share certificates, they have to
decide how much to pass on to their client in the form of higher
charges. APCIMS maintains that commissions are currently set in a fully
competitive market and ''there is little to suggest there are surplus
margins''.
People who want to retain a direct relationship with the company -- to
be sure of getting annual reports and any perks or special offers, for
instance -- have the choice of keeping share certificates or becoming
sponsored members of Crest. APCIMS points out that some trustees are
legally required to have their names on the share register rather than
hold through nominees and believes that other investors would like to
use the sponsorship facility ''if the price is right''. It complains,
however, that current indications are that charges made by banks for
sponsored membership accounts ''suggests that the facility may be
unusable''.
Although the big investing institutions, who account for most of the
value but not the volume of deals, like the idea of the flat-rate
charge, they too have a quarrel with Crest. They currently get part of
their income by lending blocks of shares to market-making firms to help
them balance their books. These will go through Crest and present
proposals for a weekly revaluation charge will, some warn, mean ''this
business will be uneconomic''.
Quite a lot of table banging will be going on before Crest starts
operating, probably in July next year.

* During the past nine years I have made several small purchases from
#750 to #2000 in the various flotations and privatisations of such
companies as TSB, BAA, British Gas and ScottishPower. What would you
consider to be the best method of disposing of such shares?
* One way would be to use ShareLink's special EasiDeal scheme which
specialises in dealing in privatisation shares through the post. It is
undertaken with just one form to fill in and the charges are low --
#7.50 for up to #500, #10 for #501 to #1000, #15 for #1001 to #2000, and
#25 for #2001 to #5000. All additional amounts over #5000 are charged at
1% commission. EasiDeal can be contacted on 0121 200 2242.
If you would prefer not to use a postal service, you could try a local
stockbroker or building society, many of whom operate a share dealing
service, though in many cases ShareLink undertakes this for them. Those
it does this for include the Halifax and Nationwide building societies
and the Abbey National bank. You may find this more expensive than using
the postal method.
* My parents, both aged over 65 years, are contemplating buying their
council house for sentimental reasons at a substantially reduced price.
My father is retired and his only income is his state pension; my mother
continues to work part-time and also receives a small pension. Their
savings amount to around #20,000 with no other income. Their current
weekly rent is #35.
They intend to put a 50% deposit down leaving around #10,000 to
borrow. Can you suggest what type of loan they should take out? They are
considering the Halifax Building Society Retirement Home Plan or a
repayment mortgage.
* They would really need to discuss this with a mortgage adviser. But
there are various factors that should be considered. If the income
available is a small pension and the salary from part-time employment,
the type of loan must be carefully thought out. They must work out
whether to choose an interest-only mortgage, as the repayment type
(where there is repayment of capital and interest) could be too hefty a
commitment. A guarantor could also be considered to support the mortgage
if income is limited. A fixed-rate mortgage may also be an option to
ensure the payment remains the same for a specific term, to help when
budgeting.
The ongoing maintenance of the property should also be a
consideration, as personal funds may be required for this in future. The
type of construction and its age may also have implications on future
maintenance costs. Life assurance, which becomes more expensive the
older you get, should also be discussed -- should one party to the
mortgage die, this may cause difficulty for the other in meeting
repayments.
As suggested, an interview with a mortgage adviser where all
circumstances can be discussed would be wise. You mention the
possibility of a Halifax plan. This would need explaining fully to see
if it would be appropriate for your parents. You do not specify their
ages but these can be an important factor. The Halifax says advisors at
any of its branches should be able to discuss the whole matter in
greater depth.
* I am looking for help in investing #20 a month for each of my two
sons who are at present aged 14 and 15. I was thinking of something that
might give a lump sum in 10 years, when hopefully they will both be
working. What do you suggest?
* A regular savings scheme investing in a unit trust might be
suitable, although finding one that offers that individual level of
investment might be tricky -- mostly they are a little above this. The
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, which is at 65
Kingsway, London WC2B 6TD, would probably be able to give you a list of
schemes and the type of funds on offer. This is, of course, an equity
investment and there is always some risk, but with a unit trust this is
widely spread.
Alternatively, you could consider investing with a Friendly Society
where you make a commitment to save a fixed amount, monthly or yearly,
for 10 years into a life insurance policy which, after the deduction of
a charge, is linked to a tax-free investment. The drawback here,
however, is that there are penalties if you cash in early. When
considering your savings plan it would be as well to see if there are
any tax implications, depending on the type chosen.
* I retired at age 62 and have a pension from my former employer of
just under #9000 a year. I will be 65 next January when I will receive
the state pension and this, together with the small amount of investment
income I have, will bring my total income to around #14,000. At this
level I should qualify for income tax age allowance next tax year.
My wife is 62 and is also retired with pension income of #3000. Can
you say if she will also be entitled to the age allowance when I
qualify? If this is the case it may be best to transfer our capital to
her to make full use of her tax allowance. When replying you could also
say if interest on Tessa accounts is taken into the age calculation?
* The main effect of independent taxation is that husband and wife are
treated as separate individuals for tax purposes. You wife's personal
allowance is, therefore, related to her own circumstances and she will
not be entitled to the age allowance until the beginning of the tax year
in which she reaches age 65.
The current income limit for age allowance is #14,000 and, as you say,
you should qualify for the year 1996-97. It should be noted that
although husband and wife are treated separately, the age related
married couples allowance is due to the husband when he or his wife is
aged 65 during the year.
Your Tessa interest is excluded from tax calculations assuming that
the normal conditions have been met, that is you have complied with the
investment and withdrawal levels for the term of the account.

SCOTTISH Equitable is launching two new unit trusts and has redesigned
its Performance PEP with more competitive charges and flexible
commission options. The PEP, for lump sum investments, is designed to
offer a range of investment options and underlying trusts to cater for
different levels of involvement for the client, as well as investments
to suit both income and growth needs.
Both the new Distribution Unit Trust and the Extra Income Unit Trust
can be incorporated into the Performance PEP. The Distribution Trust
offers a mix of income and capital growth and is aimed at the large
risk-averse market, particularly people nearing or in retirement. The
Extra Income Trust is offered in response to the ability to provide
corporate bond PEPs. Investing in fixed-interest instruments, typically
UK sterling bonds, it is intended to offer higher income than is
generally obtainable from equities or building society deposits.
Estimated yield at launch is 6.9%.
Warrant option
INVESTMENT management group Martin Currie plans to offer investors in
its new Japan Investment Trust the choice of receiving cash or warrants
with their shares. Warrants entitle the holder to purchase shares in the
future at a fixed price. Investors will have the choice of receiving
warrants in the normal way, in the ratio of one for every five shares
purchased, or a cash sum of at least 25p per warrant which represents 5p
per share.
This should give private investors in particular the opportunity to
dispose of their warrants without the costs and inconvenience associated
with selling small holdings in the secondary market. Subscription price
is 100p with a minimum investment of just #500. The offer period for the
new trust, which is aiming to capitalise on opportunities in Japan as
the economy regains some momentum, will begin on October 31 and close at
noon on November 17.
Income growth
GT Management, the international investment management group, is
introducing the GT Variable Income and Growth PEP designed to offer
investors the growth potential of shares combined with the ''high and
stable'' income provided by corporate bonds -- tax free.
The new PEP, which combines GT Income Fund and GT High Yield Fund, a
corporate bond unit trust, will enable investors to choose the yield
they require, currently up to more than 8% by selecting the appropriate
proportion to be invested in each fund. There is a minimum investment of
#500 in each trust and a monthly savings plan from #50. Initial charge
on the GT High Yield Fund is 3.5% and 4% on the GT Income Fund. The
annual charge for each is 1%.
Barclays bonds
BARCLAYS Bank is launching three new ''competitive'' fixed-rate
savings bonds which will be available from Monday. The one, two and
three-year bonds offer a graded rate of interest. Savers who invest in
the one-year bond will receive a guaranteed rate of 6.5% gross per annum
on a minimum balance of #2000, with 6.75% for two years. Three-year
investors will get 7% gross per annum.
Indian equities
GLOBAL asset manager Guinness Flight is introducing its Madras Indian
Equity Fund, the first sub-fund of Guinness Flight Select Funds, a new
Dublin-based ''UCITS'' umbrella fund. Guinness Flight says it offers the
potential for above average growth from a portfolio of high-quality
Indian equities, predominantly those of medium and small capitalised
companies based in the southern and western states. Minimum Investment
for ''A'' shares is #5000 and for ''B'' shares just under #160,000. The
initial charge of 5% is discounted to 4% until November 10 and the
annual management fee is 2% for the ''A'' shares and 1.5% for the ''B''.
Promised return
SUN Alliance has launched a five-and-a-half-year guaranteed income
bond -- The Promise Bond. It guarantees an income of 6% per annum
payable for five years, equivalent to 8% gross for basic rate taxpayers.
There is a guaranteed return of capital, no initial or annual charges,
and a stock market bonus on maturity if the market shows reasonable
growth. The minimum investment is #5000.
Investments will be accepted into the bond during the offer period
which runs until November 15, but if it is oversubscribed it may have to
be closed early. Interest will be paid at 3% every six months (with
alternatives of quarterly payments at 1.48% or a growth option). The
bond starts on November 15 and matures on May 15, 2001. Investments made
before October 17 will be boosted by 0.4% and between October 18 and 31
by 0.2%.
Bond guarantee
WOOLWICH Life, part of Woolwich Building Society, has launched a
limited issue Guaranteed Income Bond. It offers a guaranteed regular
monthly income over a term of five years. Minimum investment is #5000
and the maximum #500,000. There are two income rates, 5.6% net for
investments between #5000 and #14,999 and 5.8% net for over #15,000. At
the end of the five-year term the original investment is returned in
full, together with the final month's income. Basic rate taxpayers will
have no further income tax liability under current legislation.
Equity trap aid
SCOTTISH Provident and Johnson Fry are introducing two brand new
mortgage products. These are a Negative Equity Mortgage, aimed at those
caught in the negative equity trap, and an Independent Mortgage which
offers payment flexibility and a capital ''draw out'' facility for
either business or personal use.
On the Negative Equity Mortgage, the interest rate is set at a fixed
margin above Bank of England base rate, there is no mortgage indemnity
guarantee -- which means clients will not have to find the substantial
up-front premium often required by other negative equity schemes -- and
loans of up to 130% of the value of the property are available, up to a
maximum of #200,000. There is also automatic reduction of the interest
rate as the negative situation improves. To be eligible, clients must
have been employed for three years, be over 25 and no older than 70 at
the end of the mortgage term, be able to show proof of negative equity
and only use the loan for home purchase.
Savings scheme
EDINBURGH Fund Managers is launching an investment trust savings
scheme called SaveIT as part of a new initiative to promote its range of
investment trusts by making them more accessible to private investors.
It allows investment in a choice of nine trusts with portfolios ranging
from international general to specific regional. The trusts are
independently risk rated by NatWest Securities. Lump sum investment is
from #250 and regular monthly savings from just #30 a month.
Japanese funds
MORGAN Grenfell Asset Management is looking to Japan with the
introduction of two new Japanese funds -- the Japan Growth Unit Trust
and its offshore clone, the Japan Capital Growth Fund, which will be
based in Dublin. The Morgan Grenfell Japan Growth Trust will be launched
on October 27 at a fixed price of 100p inclusive of the initial charge.
The fixed price launch offer will run from October 16 to 27. There will
be a 1% discount for all investments made during this period. Minimum
lump sum investment is #1000, or #25 via a monthly savings scheme. The
initial charge will be 5.25% and the annual fee 1.5%.
Mortgage help
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester has launched a Negative Equity Mortgage,
enabling homeowners to move house even if they have lost equity in their
current property. It allows those with at least a three-year good
payment record -- but little or no equity in their property -- to borrow
between 95% and 125% of its value, to a total of #200,000 and up to
twice their annual income. The loan is offered at C&amp;G's standard
variable mortgage rate of 7.73% (8.3% APR) -- the lowest among major
lenders.
Pension security
BRADFORD &amp; Bingley Building Society has obtained a deal which protects
contributions towards a pension in the event of serious illness or
disability resulting in loss of income. Commercial Union will offer B&amp;B
customers a free waiver of contributions option -- with no medical
underwriting -- on personal pension plans. The deal guarantees that
pension contributions are continued, even up to normal retirement date.
Many people are probably unaware this facility exists and others can be
put off by the cost -- typically an additional 3% of the monthly
contribution.
Britannia Tessa
BRITANNIA, the UK's sixth largest building society, has unveiled a
fixed-rate Tessa at a gross rate of 7.65% for a period of five years.
There is a set opening balance of #8,315 of which #3000 (the maximum
first year personal allowance) is immediately invested in a Tessa
account, while the balance of #5,315 is placed in a ''feeder'' account
to fund the Tessa over the remaining four years. The 7.65% is guaranteed
for both accounts. Every year, interest (net of 25% for basic rate
taxpayers) is added to the feeder account. Early closure of the Tessa
will result in a 90-day interest penalty (and loss of tax-free benefits
under Inland Revenue rules).

HAS the recent fall in interest rates on many bank and building
society accounts got you looking for a more rewarding home for your
money? If so you could well be attracted by tempting returns of 7.5% or
more -- tax free -- being offered by corporate bond PEPs. For some
investors, switching into this sort of PEP could prove a very wise move.
For others, it could be a mistake. Before going ahead you should
consider your needs carefully.
Many more PEP companies will be trying to persuade savers to invest in
corporate bond plans in the coming months. Richard Branson's Virgin
Direct, which only started offering PEPs earlier this year, is one of
the latest to launch a corporate version. It has undercut its
competitors on charges and, with its ''kick the habit'' advertising
campaign, is aiming to get building society investors to change their
ways and invest in a PEP. It was initially projecting a 7.9% income
yield on its plan.
The majority of corporate bond PEPs are invested in specialist unit
trusts. Unit trusts usually deduct a front-end charge of 5%, but most
corporate bond PEPs have a charge of 3% or less. Virgin and some others,
such as Fidelity and M&amp;G, have abolished initial charges altogether.
Virgin and Fidelity have also reduced their annual charges to just 0.7%.
Other companies are charging 1% to 1.25%.
But just as you should not let high income yields determine your
choice, charges should not be your only consideration either. Investment
policy is another factor to take into account. Corporate bond PEPs can
invest in a variety of fixed-interest vehicles from company bonds to
Government securities.
Companies issue bonds and other types of fixed-interest stock when
they want to raise extra capital. Bonds are issued at a fixed rate of
interest for a set period, at the end of which the value is repaid to
investors. The larger and more well-established the company the more
likely it is to meet its obligations. Smaller ones, on the other hand,
tend to pay a higher rate of interest on their bonds to attract
investors.
Besides bonds, the PEPs can also hold convertibles, Preference shares
and Government securities. Convertibles and Preference shares are a kind
of halfway house between bonds and Ordinary shares. They are somewhat
more risky than bonds but can provide more capital growth. Government
securities or gilts are the safest bet of all because they are backed by
the Government, but the maximum proportion of a PEP that can be invested
in gilts is 45%.
Virgin will be investing the maximum amount in a spread of gilts,
tracking the Financial Times five to 15-year gilt index. The remaining
55% will always be divided equally between the 22 top-rated qualifying
corporate bonds, within the five to 15-year maturity range. But it
remains to be seen whether this method will give better results than
that of other managers who adopt a more active approach to managing
their funds.
Although many PEP companies have set up new unit trusts for their
corporate bond plans, there are some which are using trusts with an
established track record. Two which stand out are Barclay Unicorn's Gilt
Fixed Interest Fund and Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford's Convertible
and General Trust. Both have good past performance records, though
Baillie Gifford's fund has been more volatile.
Finally, before putting money into a corporate bond PEP, you should
consider three questions:
* How long do you intend to leave your investment? You can get your
money out of a unit trust-based corporate bond PEP at any time, but the
earlier you do so the more likely you are to find you have lost money.
This may be partly due to the deduction of an initial charge or an exit
charge in the early years.
It can also take time for investment returns to come through. A PEP
should be regarded as a five-year investment at least. It is no
substitute for a bank and building society account that you can dip into
at any time. And, if you are investing for much more than five years,
you will probably be better off in an equity income unit trust PEP which
can provide you with both an increasing income and growth of capital.
* Do you need an income from your investment or are you putting it
aside as a nest egg for the future? Corporate bond PEPs are for
investors who need an immediate and high income from their capital. If
you want your savings to grow, you would be better off with an equity
PEP. Over periods of five years or more shares have historically
provided better returns than bonds.
* How much risk do you want to take? Most PEP managers are stressing
the low-risk nature of corporate bond PEPs but some believe this is
being overdone. NatWest Unit Trust Managers has pointed out its research
shows that a 1% rise in interest rates can reduce the capital value of a
typical 10-year corporate bond by around 7%. If you feel you cannot take
any risks with your money, stick to investments where the capital value
is guaranteed.

TALK of Tessas is all the rage at the moment as the fifth anniversary
of their launch draws nearer. So how will yours shape up? The table
below shows how the top 20 Tessas from major building societies and
banks could look in January, providing the interest rates they pay
remain unchanged until then.
The five leading Tessa providers have all topped the #12,000 mark,
despite major falls in interest rates over the five years. But the
doughty Dunfermline Building Society looks like beating the lot with a
forecast payout of more than #12,340.
Customers of the big banks, however, may be feeling pretty short
changed by the performance of their investments. Only one, the TSB,
appears in the top 20. Even the payment of a special #125 bonus to some
customers can only lift the Royal Bank of Scotland into 22nd place with
a projected maturity value of #11,810.47. To qualify for the special
bonus you need to have paid the maximum into a Royal Bank Tessa within
10 days of each yearly anniversary.
Banks cannot afford to be too complacent as Tessa savers decide what
to do with the estimated #15bn to #18bn they'll have available for
reinvestment or spending next year, especially with a few juicy,
fixed-rate returns already on offer.
Many people fear they'll miss out on a bonus by switching their Tessa
before maturity, but in many cases these may amount to only #10 or #20
and the loss could be outweighed by transferring now to an account
paying a higher basic rate.
If you believe, as many experts do, that interest rates are likely to
remain low for the forseeable future, then fixed-rate Tessas look
tempting. National &amp; Provincial's is still paying 7.5% tax-free despite
cuts in all its other savings rates this week, and the same fixed rate
is also available from Save &amp; Prosper.
But with building societies and banks continuing to cut returns for
investors these offers may not be around for long.
Another important question facing savers with both the Halifax and the
National &amp; Provincial building societies is how the end of their Tessa's
five-year stint will affect their entitlement to free shares and cash
bonuses in the future.
''We know the account ends after five years, but where does that leave
us when it comes to the bonuses we're told will be paid when the Halifax
goes public? Will we miss out because our Tessa has ended?'' one reader
has written to ask.
If you have a Halifax or N&amp;P Tessa you need not lose out when it
matures, but both societies' plans to convert into a bank do affect your
options.
According to a recent report, a third of Tessa savers are planning to
spend some or all of their Tessa money, but Halifax and N&amp;P investors
must resist the temptation to go on a spending spree -- or put back the
money later next year -- if they are to make the most of the free shares
due to come their way at the time of conversion.
Halifax savers who had at least #100 in their Tessa account on
November 25, 1994, should qualify for free shares worth between #600 and
#800 -- providing the account is still open when the society's special
meeting takes place late in 1996 to approve the conversion.
N&amp;P savers should receive a flat-rate bonus worth #500 for accounts in
force on April 28 this year and which stay open until the society is
absorbed by Abbey National.
If your Tessa is the only account you have with either society, you
should arrange to reinvest at least #100 as soon as it matures to
preserve your membership rights. But if you want to qualify for the
variable bonus too, then you may need to reinvest more of your Tessa
money.
Halifax savers with at least #1000 in their accounts on November 25
last year should qualify for this. The exact value hasn't been announced
yet, but we do know that it will be based on the lower of the balances
in your Halifax accounts on either November 25, 1994, or the day of the
special meeting.
Anyone who has been putting the maximum into a Halifax Tessa would
have accumulated more than #11,000 in their account by November last
year, but they will only be able to roll over capital of up to #9000
into a follow-up Tessa when their original plan matures next year.
Inland Revenue rules say that savers cannot reinvest any interest
built up in the plan, unless the total maturity value is less than
#3000. In that case interest from the original plan can be used to top
up the new first year investment to the #3000 level.
Halifax savers must make their balance up to the November 1994 level
before the date of the special meeting if they are to enjoy the highest
possible variable bonus. The society says savers will be given several
weeks warning of the exact date.
Savers who put the full #9000 into a new Tessa won't be able to add to
it. But the interest built up in their old Tessa can be used to open or
add to another savings account with the Halifax before the SGM.
Remember, it's the total of savings in all your Halifax accounts, up to
a maximum of #50,000, that counts for the variable bonus.
Details of the N&amp;P variable offer should be known later this month,
which won't be a minute too soon for savers wondering what to do with
their maturing Tessas.
* Table compiled by Blays MoneyMaster for Bradford &amp; Bingley. Figures
include top 20 societies and largest banks only -- smaller societies may
produce better results. Projections assume Tessa was opened on January
1, 1991 (or the date the Tessa first became available), maximum
investment has been made each year, no withdrawals of interest have
taken place, and that rates at July 31, 1995, remain unchanged until the
end of the five-year term. Figures include bonuses paid or payable.

GIVEN the highly competitive business environment in the UK, it is not
surprising that companies across industry are keen to increase their
size and thereby grab market share. Such a process is taking place in
the domestic electricity generation and distribution market.
The brewing industry has had its share of upheavals and faces a
difficult future. Changing tastes and demographics are expected to
continue to exert pressure on brewers' margins
As a result of the increase in the rave culture, large numbers of
young people have switched away from alcoholic drinks. This is supported
by the growth of the overall soft drinks market. Many of those who do
drink beer prefer to drink ''premium'' imported beer.
While the real price continues to increase, volumes are under
pressure. Since 1979, tax has increased by 59% on beer, while overall
demand has fallen by around 16%.
There has been a steady increase in take-home consumption at the
expense of visits to the pub. Beer sold through clubs and pubs has
declined by 27% over the same period. The ''real'' price of a pint of
beer, including the effects of VAT, has increased by more than 60% since
1979.
More recently price competition from cheap imports has added to the
industry's woes so we can expect the industry's annual plea to the
Chancellor to cut excise duties in the Budget to be louder than ever
this year.
Those brewers, such as the enlarged Greenalls, with exposure to
activities other than brewing are likely to be the best placed to
prosper. Following the Boddingtons acquisition, Greenalls will be the
UK's largest independent pub retail chain and the leading independent
drinks wholesaler.

HOW many debtors would love to be in the same position as Eurotunnel's
Sir Alastair Morton -- owing the banks #8450m and their having no choice
but to support him until the difficulties are traded out over the
remaining 57 years of the concession.
The banks and Sir Alastair need each other desperately as they have a
common interest in building up traffic and thereby cash flow. But they
could well dip in the short term as it was made pretty clear yesterday
that Eurotunnel, despite its problems, is playing a long game. Its
audacity should appeal to its 225 creditors.
The new tariff seems almost certain to result in lower prices over the
winter and spring seasons when ferry traffic is normally reduced with
sharply lower tourist traffic. Eurotunnel already has half the
commercial vehicle traffic and that will undoubtedly grow as transport
companies insure against winter weather delays through what is now a
highly proven alternative.
The ferry companies seem to have shot themselves in the foot through
increasing capacity both this year and next while the psychological
impact of the stranding of the Stena Sealink vessel outside Calais will
not be really felt until Easter.
The odd #20m of revenue here or there from lower tariffs over the next
nine months will not really make much difference to Eurotunnel but is
much more important to P&amp;O and Stena Sealink which will also find
pressure mounting on the duty free side which generates an appreciable
proportion of their profits.
Already Eurotunnel has slashed its prices by a third across the board
and is prepared to cut and cut again until it wins while longer term its
campaign to have the duty free concession removed should succeed but
probably not before the General Election.
But for the poor shareholder who may have lost 90% of the investment,
it is now too late to sell. The increasing clarity of the position where
the company is generating increasing cash flow before interest payments
puts a floor of sorts under the stock but a maiden dividend postponed
until perhaps 2010 requires undue patience.
However, it has been obvious throughout that those who invest in
Eurotunnel as individuals do it partly for emotional reasons as well as
hoping to make money -- and so why 600,000 of the 720,000 shareholders
should be French, not all Anglophiles, is inexplicable.
Beer woes
GIVEN the highly competitive business environment in the UK, it is not
surprising that companies across industry are keen to increase their
size and thereby grab market share. Such a process is taking place in
the domestic electricity generation and distribution market.
The brewing industry has had its share of upheavals and faces a
difficult future. Changing tastes and demographics are expected to
continue to exert pressure on brewers' margins
As a result of the increase in the rave culture, large numbers of
young people have switched away from alcoholic drinks. This is supported
by the growth of the overall soft drinks market. Many of those who do
drink beer prefer to drink ''premium'' imported beer.
While the real price continues to increase, volumes are under
pressure. Since 1979, tax has increased by 59% on beer, while overall

1979.

industry's woes so we can expect the industry's annual plea to the
Chancellor to cut excise duties in the Budget to be louder than ever

MANWEB chief executive John Roberts derided ScottishPower's #1100m bid
as ''mean'' and will see its relatively low acceptance rate of 60% as a
vindication of his argument.
But the Scots, pleased as punch with the success of their border raid,
will describe the bid as ''canny''.
ScottishPower chief executive Ian Robinson is to be congratulated for
keeping his nerve in the takeover frenzy gripping the electricity sector
and resisting the temptation to raise his bid further.
A modest #60m improvement to ScottishPower's original offer sufficed
to finesse the shares of enough institutional investors to win the day.
ScottishPower's shareholders and customers, who would have borne the
cost of a more expensive purchase, should be grateful.
The ScottishPower board must deliver on its promise to make Manweb a
more efficient and profitable animal.
For the 3000 staff of Manweb this will be a painful process. Their
number may be halved over the next three or four years.
But Manweb employees were stuck between a rock and a hard place.
Had Roberts and his team remained in control at Chester, swingeing job
cuts would have followed in any case.
How else could they cut costs by #107m over two years and make
possible a promised 550p a share benefits package for shareholders?
Following ScottishPower's successful grab of Manweb and Scottish &amp;
Newcastle's #425m takeover of Courage, many people must now be wondering
which will be the next Scottish company to stage a cross-border raid.
The next victim will not necessarily be English or Welsh. Bank of
Scotland has shown by its #235m purchase of a controlling stake in
Australia's BankWest that Scottish entrepreneurs have wider horizons.

EUROTUNNEL lost #465m in the first half of this year, equivalent to
#104,000 an hour, but is intent on cutting tariffs over the next few
weeks to gain market share from the ferry operators.
''We will hit them hard and where it hurts,'' said co-chairman Sir
Alastair Morton who indicated that he will cut duty-free prices again.
This is in addition to the one-third across the board discounts already
introduced and which have resulted in improvements in traffic volumes.
The total debt now amounts to #8.45bn. But he said that a debt for
equity swap is the last resort for both the company and banks.
Putting the company into receivership has been ruled out. Any
successor would have intractable legal problems as the assets in both
Britain and France are jointly owned. His contract runs until October
next year, and he dismissed suggestions that his head could roll as part
of the refinancing plan which will be put together early next year. That
plan will have to be approved by all the 225 syndicate banks.
Lawyers fees alone since 1990 have amounted to #50m.
In the middle of last month, Eurotunnel told its banks it was
suspending all its interest payments except for #3m a month on some
senior debt in the first stage of an agreed 18-month moratorium.
Interest costs amounted to #365m in the half year compared with
net-operating revenue of just #105m. That is below expectations thanks
to the combination of equipment failures and the intense competition
from the ferries which cut fares by up to 25%.
That has surprised Eurotunnel which had expected a fall in capacity,
but instead the operators are putting more ships on the Dover-Calais
route -- a move that Sir Alastair described as insane.
Eurotunnel is to sue the British and French governments, British Rail
and its French partner SNCF and the TML constructon group for a total of
more than #2 billion ''and then some''.
This is because of the alleged subsidy of the duty-free franchise to
the ferry companies which accounts for a large part of their profits,
the failure of the railways to meet their contractual volume targets of
providing 50% of tunnel-train movements and the contractors for not
providing the equipment to specification.
Sir Alastair complained that Eurotunnel has to demonstrate a full
safety check for the seventh time although the ferry operators have not
been required to show they can disembark 1000 passengers in mid-channel.
More encouragingly, market share is increasing rapidly with level
pegging with P&amp;O in the summer on car traffic at 34% compared with Stena
Sealink's 25% and Hoverspeed's 7%. This has since risen to 36%. It now
has 49% of the heavy goods vehicle business and is gaining share from
the airlines on the London-Paris route.
Eurotunnel shares edged [1/2]p ahead to 92[1/2]p with the City
forecasting losses of around #900m for the full year. There are still
fears that Eurotunnel will need a rights issue in due course or a
debt-equity swap rather than the partnership with the banks on sharing
cash flow which is expected to increase substantially next year.
A shareholder committee is being set up -- the first time that has
occured with a British company. It will be made up of a dozen
shareholders and is designed to improve communication. The vast majority
of Eurotunnel shareholders are French.

FISONS yesterday made a formal complaint to the Takeover Panel that
double counting by hostile bidder Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's brokers ABN AMRO
Hoare Govett had created a false impression as to the level of activity
in the market on Thursday morning.
At one stage, volume had been shown at more than 252 million Fisons
shares changing hands but that number was later reduced by 43 million
once the mistake was discovered.
Fisons said that it was concerned that a false market may have been
created in its shares immediately after RPR increased its cash offer by
25p to 265p.

FEARS that the UK economy may be sliding back into recession were
temporarily deferred yesterday following publication of domestic
economic data showing a rebound in factory output, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Manufacturing production rose by 0.6% compared with July, according to
figures published by the Central Statistical Office. The Treasury
described the data as ''encouraging''.
The increase followed a 0.2% decline in July, revised from an initial
estimate of a 0.4% decline. The rebound in August was stronger than
expected in the City, and took the level of factory output back to its
pre-recession peak of March 1990.
Reflecting declines in oil and other energy output, industrial
production was flat in August although the July increase was revised up
from 0.3% to 0.6%.
Over the latest three months manufacturing output rose at a seasonally
adjusted annualised rate of 1.1%, compared with 0.9% in the three months
to July. Industrial production declined at an annualised rate of 0.4% in
the three months to August.
David Walton, senior international economist at Goldman Sachs,
believes that the monthly data is consistent with a rise of about
0.4-0.5% in third quarter GDP, due to be published on October 23.
If the economic slowdown continues into the fourth quarter then he
thinks that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, may be
encouraged to make a small cut in interest rates as an insurance policy
against a more sustained downturn in economic activity.
Sterling showed little reaction to the economic data. The currency
markets were quiet ahead of this weekend's G7 meeting.
The pound was down just over a half of a pfennig to DM2.2536 and it
was down over a third of a cent against the dollar at $1.5813.
Sterling's trade weighted index rose by 0.1 to 85.1.

BREWING
GREENALLS, the pubs, off licences and De Vere hotels group, is buying
rival Boddington in an agreed deal worth #518m. The recommended offer
comprises 17 new Greenalls shares and #20 in cash for every 25
Boddington shares with a partial cash alternative.
The offer, equivalent to 412p a Boddington share, represents a premium
of 51% to the closing price of Boddington on October 4. News of the bid
pushed Boddington's shares up 31[1/2]p to 389[1/2]p. The firm's shares
have been rising recently on takeover speculation. Greenalls dropped
26[1/2]p to 462p.
The offer is said to be final unless a competitive bid arises. Hubert
Reid, chairman of Boddington, has been invited to join the board of
Greenalls as a non-executive director.
The acquisition will give Greenalls around 300 managed pubs and pub
restaurants and a further 150 tenanted pubs, creating the UK's largest
pub/retail chain of more than 2,370 pubs.
Andrew Thomas, chairman of Greenalls, said that Boddington was ''an
excellent strategic fit'' for his group.
It sees benefits from the realisation of cost savings, estimated at
#18m per annum.
Around 500 jobs are expected to go in the head office, administration,
clerical, financial and marketing staff.
0 Assisted by the good summer weather and growth in food sales,
Greenalls expects annual profits of at least #100m in the year to
September, 1995.
Demand in Greenall's lodges was strong with occupancy rising by 6% to
72%. Occupancy levels also rose in its four and five-star hotels. Its
off-licences had a good year with profits up more than 25%, reflecting
the benefits of improved purchasing, restructuring and the introduction
of new concepts.

THE COPTHORNE Hotel overlooking Glasgow's George Square is changing
hands again -- this time going to a Singapore company.
The deal for the 18-strong Copthorne chain, owned by Irish airline Aer
Lingus, is due to be formally signed at midnight tomorrow.
CDL Hotels, part of the Singapore Hong Leong group, will pay about
#224m to the debt-laden, state-owned Irish airline, which is selling off
non-core businesses to cut operating losses.
The Glasgow hotel, which has had a chequered career since 1983, will
be restored to former glories, according to its new general manager
Mandy Scott.
The present owners have spent #800,000 in refurbishments over the past
five years; another #250,000 on a recent facelift to the Victorian
facade, and scheduled #200,000 to complete bedroom upgrading and a new
look for the La Mirage bar.
Ms Scott, 31, the Copthorne chain's youngest general manager, said
that CDL will continue investment in Glasgow. She added: ''The intention
is to restore the hotel to its former glories when it was known as the
North British. It has a fantastic location, and we want it back in its
rightful place as one of Glasgow's top hotels.
CDL, described as the most acquisitive hotel group in the world over
the past two years, already owns 37 hotels. The latest deal will provide
a strategic foothold in Europe, where the Copthorne chain has 11
four-star hotels in the UK and others in France and Germany.
Ms Scott said the full-time staff of 75 in Glasgow will increase as
more investment and business are attracted. She confirmed that the
much-maligned conservatory overlooking George Square will be replaced in
due course.
The conservatory was installed by Cairo-born entrepreneur, Emil Malak,
who paid #1.5m for the hotel in 1983, then owned by British Rail and
called the North British.
Mr Malak was awarded grants of #207,000 and #90,000 respectively from
the Scottish Tourist Board and the Historic Buildings Council, plus
Scottish Development Agency grants and loans of #200,000.
He sold the hotel, which he renamed The Diplomat, just two years later
for #5m to a subsidiary of British Caledonian Airways who launched the
Copthorne name. The chain was subsequently taken over by Aer Lingus in
1987.
Ms Scott, transferred from the Aberdeen Copthorne to take charge of
the 141-bedroom Glasgow hotel, said it will go upmarket, with CDL aiming
at the business community in particular.
She added: ''The Copthorne has been overtaken in terms of glitz since
it was the North British, and we plan to restore the former glories of
many years ago.''
A 9% increase in turnover to #14m is forecast for next year by Ms
Scott, who intends to build on the 10-year old Copthorne brand name,
being retained by the new owners.
She joined the Copthorne chain as an assistant manager in 1986 after
gaining an honours degree in hotel and catering management.
CDL, which in April bought the famous Plaza Hotel in New York in a
joint venture with a nephew of King Fahd of Saui Arabia, has hotels in
Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Phillipines, Singapore,
Taiwan. It also owns the Gloucester, Bailey's, and the Chelsea in
London.
Business sources predict CDL will seek a public listing on the London
Stock Exchange, with such a flotation covering its North American and
European interests valued at more than #630m.

THE reclusive Barclay brothers are buying the five-star Ritz Hotel in
London for #75m cash, equivalent to #575,000 per room, writes NICOLA
REEVES.
The mega-rich brothers, who already own other hotels and The European
newspaper, are buying the hotel through Ellerman Investments, their
investment vehicle, and an affiliated company.
The seller is the conglomerate Trafalgar House whose other interests
include the QE2 and the John Brown and Davy engineering companies. It
had been trying to sell the Ritz for several years. The Ritz has a book
value of about #60m and last year made a profit of #3.8m.
The Ritz, the first steel-framed building in London, was opened in
1906 and bought by Trafalgar House in 1976. When it opened, a single
room without a bath but including electric light cost 10s 6d (52[1/2]p)
a night. That compares with around #200 today.
The sale is expected to be completed early next month with Trafalgar
House using the proceeds to pay off some of its #200m borrowings. The
Ritz is the last of Trafalgar House's hotels to be sold as part of its
plan to concentrate on its construction and engineering businesses.

ANYONE who has visited the US will know that the supreme destroyers of
TV pleasure are the adverts. These barge in without politely waiting for
natural breaks, demolishing continuity and interest. Adverts play key
roles, programme bit parts.
We could be heading toward that precipice if the advertisers continue
to believe that this is a profitable medium. One way we could avoid this
fate is to boycott any product advertised on telly. Simple, effective,
mind-boggling.
Jack Webster said British television advertising is among the wittiest

22).

IAN Bell's column and Jimmy Reid's Politics and Principles may provide
clues to the absence of any feel-good factor among the electorate at
present (September 20 and 21).
Both writers seem to offload their frustration with politics and
politicians on the unfortunate reader. Neither writer makes much
attempt, as far as I can see, to inform or educate us and they certainly
do not entertain us. They do, repeatedly, deliver generalisations bereft
of any analysis and they make little effort to present ideas for
improvement in the situations which seem to annoy them so much.
Maybe both writers need to lower the targets and accept that the vast
majority of politicians have feet of clay and hence too much cannot
realistically be expected of them. As a people, we are certainly a lot
better off than our parents and grandparents, but I very much doubt that
this is due to our politicians. Silk purses cannot be made out of sows'
ears!
But Bell and Reid should give readers a break by reducing the
frequency of negative generalisations. Could they be more specific?
Why not indulge in a little more analysis and measurement of these
situations that so annoy them, present them logically and coherently,
and conclude with specific positive proposals for their solution?

IAIN WILSON in his report on Rangers' annual report and accounts says
that ''debts now stand at #33.3m compared with #26.3m the year before,''
and also that ''the accounts reveal interest charges have more than
doubled at #1,096,000'' (October 5).
He has not gone beyond the published profit and loss account and
balance sheet in extracting figures for comment, thus ignoring the
detailed information contained in the Notes to the Accounts. He also
chose not to check his figures with anyone at the club.
Had he looked further he would have found that within the balance
sheet headings relating to ''creditors'', which do indeed total #33.3m,
only #10m relate to borrowings (slightly increased from the #9m at the
previous year end).
The remainder of the creditors figure relates to a number of ordinary
working capital items and, most significantly, some #12m of deferred
income relating to advance sales of season tickets and sponsorships.
These, in any normal parlance, would not be classed as debts.
The reference to ''doubled interest charges'' would tend also to give
a picture of greatly increased borrowings. Again, examination of the
notes show that in last year's figure there was an exceptional credit of
#337,000 leaving the underlying trend an increase of some 35%.
Over a period when base interest rates grew by 29% the real picture is
of a modest increase in borrowings in a year when the club incurred net
capital expenditure of #3.6m.
The true picture of Rangers Football Club's financial performance over
the year to May 1995, therefore, reflects prudent management in a season
when unfortunately we did not participate to any real extent in any of
the cup competitions and yet delivered a modest profit. At the same time
the club continued to invest heavily both in stadium facilities and
developing the team without materially increasing exposure to interest
bearing debt.
It is a pity that your chief reporter did not take the opportunity
during his interview with Mr Murray to seek some financial guidance
which might have prevented him from misleading your readers.
The club commend, however, your headline, ''Rangers give pledge to
stand by grassroots supporters''.

CORRESPONDENCE about the financial situation of medical students and
junior hospital doctors has thrown up an interesting conundrum.
Barclay McBain and Eleanor Houghton reported that the salary of such
doctors on appointment was #18,000 a year, plus a further unspecified
amount in respect of additional hours worked (September 4). The source
of this information was not given.
Dr Downes wrote that their basic salary was #13,930 a year for a
40-hour week with payment of #3.50 per hour for a maximum of a further
32 hours extra work (September 20).
Dr Downes's figures were published in the British Medical Journal. Can
someone please explain this discrepancy of #4000?
This is really quite a significant factor in considering these young
people's capacity to repay their loans. Total income is a crucial
element in assessing the severity of the burden imposed by a debt.
I do not question that the payment -- especially the extra hours
payment -- received by the junior doctors is hard earned. Nevertheless,
it forms part of their financial resources and should be taken into
account in considering how far they should be regarded as a special case
in comparison with other groups.
Surely the likely overall earnings of a lifetime should also be taken
into account, insofar as this is possible. From Whitaker's Almanac,
1995, I was able to obtain salary scales for Scottish teachers in 1993.
The basic range was from #11,562 to #19,219 a year on a 10-point scale,
with the point of entry according to qualification.
I should be surprised if the point of entry for five and six-year
trained graduates matched Dr Downes' #13,930 a year. As for increased
earnings as their careers advance, head teachers received from #24,375
to #45,190 a year according to the nature and size of the school. The
number of head teachers earning the maximum salary is, of course, very
limited.
Perhaps in the light of these figures Dr Downes might consider whether
medical students and junior hospital doctors are really in such a
disadvantaged position in comparison with other professions.

AS John Macleod says himself, ''Something must indeed be done''.
For the first time ever I, and I'm sure many others, have found myself
agreeing wholeheartedly with one of his articles. The one, that is,
concerning the Princess of Wales (October 3).
Truly a remarkable day!

IN his article on the Scottish Church Census Professor Steve Bruce
writes that the social reformer William Wilberforce reacted to the
Church Census of 1851 by making adverse comments on the calibre of
dissenting clergy. William Wilberforce died in 1833. Could Professor
Bruce be thinking of Bishop Samuel Wilberforce?
William Wilberforce was a man of wide evangelical sympathies and would
not have commented so disparagingly on dissenting clergymen.

SUNDAY, October 1, marked the fiftieth anniversary of Christian Aid,
yet another of these wonderful idealistic agencies set up in the wake of
the Second World War.
While in many respects the problems faced by poor people in poor
countries seem at times to get worse rather than better, there is a
great deal to be thankful for in the work that has been done in the past
50 years. It has been crucial in raising both funds and awareness here,
and in supporting the enormous efforts for change that have been made by
the people of the poor countries themselves.
Throughout Scotland this autumn church people are holding special
services, parties, vigils, ceilidhs, to recognise the work already done
and to acknowledge the continuing need, and to thank those who have
given of their time, energy, and resources and to encourage the doubtful
to get involved in the work of bringing about a better, fairer, and more
just world.

THE depths to which John Macleod sank in his vilification of the
Princess of Wales say more about him, his upbringing, and the fitness of
his own character than his article could ever do about his subject
(October 3).
This ''pub brawl'' diatribe, recirculating the worst hysteria of the
tabloid paparrazzo hacks, served no purpose.
Here is a man who prefers invective to reason, who in rewriting
history exposes his juvenile prejudice. This must be one of those
occasions when all responsible adults must regret the passing of a
corporal response.  Perhaps we were meant to be shocked to respond as
''Outraged from Tunbridge Wells''? Instead I feel more sorrow for John
Macleod, his family and friends, than for the Princess herself. Whatever
the tribulations of her private life, her public record stands. And will
stand long after John Macleod has grown older, wiser, and progressed to
joined-up writing.

DR David Delvin gave a fairly clear message to ''a busy executive''
that, give or take a few possible side effects, he might derive ''great
benefit'' from influenza vaccinations (Man Alive, October 5).
Dr Delvin must surely be aware of the recommendations of the Chief
Medical Officer in this respect in identifying groups of patients for
whom vaccination is indicated.
''Busy executives'' are not included in this list unless of course
they are otherwise suffering from conditions which are relevant, eg
chest, heart, and kidney disorders.
In the same issue Mr Sam Galbraith succinctly argued the case for
limited health resources to be allocated on the basis of need and not
demand.
In the next few weeks many doctors will face demands for flu
vaccination for patients who are often referred to as ''the worried
well'' and for whom there is no indication to vaccinate.
Dr Delvin's reply is not seen to be helpful as doctors attempt to
allocate properly this resource for which, in relatively recent winters,
need has in fact exceeded supply.

FOR better or worse the visit of Gerry Adams has come and gone, the
fairly predictable reactions to his visit having taken place. The
expressions and postures of the protesters have been frozen in camera
and captioned by headlines in varying degrees of luridness (October 2).
He was present to attend a ''Go for Peace'' meeting organised by the
Scottish Committee for Peace in Ireland. The availability of tickets to
attend the meeting was directed toward individuals and organisations
which would unquestioningly provide Mr Adams with support for his
utterances.
It was advised by a Labour Party member that ''trouble-makers'' would
not gain entry. This would have to be taken to mean anyone who disagreed
with Mr Adams's philosophy.
If this was to be a meeting in support of peace in Ireland, why was
entry allowed to a section which marched up the pavement, on the
opposite side to the protest, shouting and gesticulating support for the
IRA and flaunting a drum-skin embossed with the paramilitary symbol of a
hooded terrorist? Was their attendance at the meeting really to listen
to Adams in his adopted role as an apostle of peace? Or were they
present to idolise Adams in his more familiar role as an icon of the
IRA?

THE spin doctors in the Labour Party must have had a fit when they
learnt that the news of the verdict in the O J Simpson trial was delayed
and would likely relegate their leader's speech to the second item on
the news.
I know how they feel. Due to the Labour Party playing party politics
most of the resolutions discussed during the first day of the SNP
conference got little or no coverage by the press. Included in this
category were resolutions on health.
I moved the first item on the agenda which covered palliative care and
the hospice movement. There were motions on women's health and banning
cigarette advertising that also failed to get the coverage they
deserved.
I can understand that the press had little or no choice but to cover
the OJ Simpson verdict, but surely they are mature enough to see through
the dirty tricks of the Labour Party?
It is really sad to think that the Scottish media consider it more
important to have party leaders at loggerheads than to report on how
grassroot political activists feel about care for the terminally ill,
the health of women, and the repercussions on health from cigarette
advertising.

Gerd Bucerius, born 1906, died September 29, 1995
GERD Bucerius, one of the best-known publishing magnates of post-war
Germany, died of natural causes on Friday in Hamburg aged 89, the
newspaper Die Zeit said.
Bucerius co-founded Die Zeit, Germany's leading political and cultural
weekly, in 1946 and was its publisher until he handed the reins over to
former chancellor Helmut Schmidt in 1985.
During a long career, he was also part-owner of the illustrated weekly
Stern, the business weekly Wirtschaftswoche and Gruner and Jahr,
Germany's biggest magazine publisher.
He was on the board of Bertelsmann, one of the world's largest
publishing groups, from 1973 to 1991.
Trained as a lawyer, Bucerius openly defended Jews and other Germans
persecuted by the Nazis in the 1930s until he was barred from legal
work.
His marriage to a Jew, which in Nazi eyes made him ''unworthy of the
army'', saved him from being sent to fight on the frontlines during the
Second World War.
Apart from his publishing work, Bucerius was a member of the West
German parliament from its start in 1949 until he clashed with his
Christian Democratic party in 1962.
He quit the party and parliament after the CDU publicly criticised as
an affront to Christian feelings an article in his iconoclastic Stern
magazine entitled: ''Is there really fire burning in Hell?''

Hugh Leishman Inglis (Peter) Runciman CBE, company director, born
October 9, 1928, Venado Tuerto, Argentina, died July 21, 1995, Scotland.
A MEMORIAL service will be held at 2pm this Monday in Glasgow
Cathedral for the life of Peter Runciman, former chairman of waste
management and construction group Shanks &amp; McEwan, board member of
British Steel and past-president of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, who
died this summer after a long fight against a viral heart disease first
diagnosed in 1990.
Peter Runciman was one of the quiet men of Scottish business. As a
late returner to the land of his roots, he preferred the stimulating
company of close friends and the challenge of the grouse moors and
salmon rivers he loved to the constant round of higher profile business
dinners and conferences, networking with the publicly powerful. It is,
perhaps, a mark of the man that there was no Who's Who entry.
That reserve should not be confused with reclusiveness. Peter Runciman
had an alert and questioning mind and a wide-ranging intellectual
curiosity. His life outwith business was full and rich, ranging from his
two-acre garden at Rhu to a deep love of opera. He was engaging company,
but a reluctant public speaker.
He was born in Argentina, his cattle-rearing father the youngest son
of a family of 13 children, whose parents had emigrated from Scotland to
New Zealand. Peter's New Zealand grandfather was one of a long line of
Church of Scotland ministers.
His great grandfather was the Rev Matthew Leishman, a significant
figure in the nineteeth-century Disruption. ''Peter was in no doubt
about his identity as a Scotsman,'' recalls a close friend.
The young Peter learned his love of field sports very early, in the
heartlands of Argentina and in Paraguay, shooting at his father's side.
He was educated at St Alban's College in Buenos Aires but, in 1946 at
the age of 18, with many of the Nazi high command seeking refuge in
South America, Runciman came to London, to enrol as an officer cadet in
the Indian Army.
He never made it to India then in the preparatory throws of
independence. Instead he was commissioned in the Corps of Royal
Engineers and saw active and dangerous service in Palestine and Egypt.
He then read electrical engineering at King's College, London,
graduating, in 1951 with an honours degree. In 1954 he joined Chloride,
the makers of Exide batteries, eventually becoming assistant chief
designer and then assistant works manager. He is credited as inventor of
the Exide Autofill battery, displaying an ability to find innovative
solutions to problems which was to become a hallmark of the rest of his
business career.
He met and, in 1957, married his wife Rosemary (Hadfield) and in 1961
joined his father-in-law's firm, Derbyshire Stone Quarries, as personal
assistant to the MD. Later he became assistant managing director. In
1969 Derbyshire Stone became part of Tarmac but Runciman continued to
climb the management tree, under the new owners.
He went to Harvard Business School, to complete the demanding advanced
management programme and, on his return, found himself increasing used
as an internal troubleshooter, sorting out underperforming parts of the
Tarmac empire. These company doctoring assignments included a spell as
MD of Kings &amp; Co, a Tarmac subsidiary based in Glasgow. Tarmac also gave
him overseas responsibilities, notably in Germany and South Africa.
The Kings appointment brought Runciman back to Scotland and, in 1975,
he and Rosemary and their growing family of three young daughters bought
Shoreacres at Rhu, which was to remain the family home for the rest of
his life.
In 1980 he joined the board of Shanks &amp; McEwan as chairman designate.
The Lanarkshire-based group, by then nearly 100 years old, was badly in
need of rescue. It had had its high points. The business Guy Shanks had
founded in the 1880s had, at one point, run a fleet of eight
Rolls-Royces. But, by 1980, with the decline in the local steel
industry, it was turning over #26m and losing money.
Peter Runciman, who became chairman in 1981, immediately set about a
capital reconstruction and a rationalisation of its rambling structure,
to focus on what he saw as its core competencies. One he identified,
which at that time was a very small adjunct, was waste management.
Under Runciman's chairmanship, Shanks &amp; McEwan enjoyed a spirited
revival. In 1986 he concluded a deal to buy London Brick from Hanson,
the move inspired by the prospect of turning its redundant claypits into
new landfill sites rather than any great desire to get into construction
materials. As part of the deal Hanson took a non-threatening 20% stake
in Shanks.
Runciman believed strongly in putting something back into the
community and, apart from his diverse roles with Scottish Opera, the
Outward Bound Association, Glasgow's Trades House, and Greater Glasgow
Health Board, he served for two years between 1986 and 1987 as president
of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.
There he struck up a particularly close relationship with the chief
executive, Ewan Marwick, in whom, many say, he saw a younger version of
himself. They enjoyed field sports together. Both had deeply inquisitive
natures. Marwick's premature death, in a road accident in Russia in
1993, grieved him deeply.
In 1988, Shanks &amp; McEwan was successfully floated on the Stock
Exchange. In 1991, it paid #176m to acquire Rechem. By 1992, the
transformation Peter Runciman and his team had wrought seemed complete,
turnover had reached #146m, pre-tax profits topped #27m.
However, by 1992 the life-threatening condition he had begun to
wrestle with was taking its toll. That December, he bowed out of Shanks
&amp; McEwan ''with a lot of satisfaction and no real regrets''. Life has
been difficult since, for the group he rescued, and that would have been
a matter for personal regret.
But, by then, Peter Runciman had a bigger, personal challenge to
confront. Friends say he bore his debilitating illness with great
fortitude and courage. When he was well enough, he would still shoot and
fish the waters of the Dionard in Sutherland, where his family had a
share in an estate.
He is survived by his wife Rosemary and three daughters, one of whom
is a field social worker in the Possil area of Glasgow.

Dr James Lorraine Trainer, former chief dental officer for Scotland.
Born July 28, 1914. Died October 1, 1995.
A FUNERAL service was held in Kelso yesterday for Dr James Trainer, a
Borders polymath whose interests went well beyond dentistry and
medicine.
He was one of the last of the generation to qualify in both subjects
before the two were effectively separated as university courses. After
Kelso High School and George Watson's College in Edinburgh, he achieved
the dental qualification in 1937 and in medicine a year later.
As a medical officer in the RAF during the Second World War, he
volunteered to fly with crews to experience at first hand the kind of
stress which he saw as psychological trauma in aircrew returning from
sorties.
His war service took him to several theatres including North Africa
and evacuating casualties from France after the Normandy landings. He
was mentioned in dispatches in 1944.
Dr Trainer practised dentistry in Kelso until 1963. He served as chief
dental officer at the Scottish Office between 1971 to 1979 at the time
of the resurgence in preventative dentistry, for which he was a
passionate advocate of fluoridation of water. He was made an honorary
fellow in dental surgery by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.
As an amateur historian and archeologist, he wrote several monographs
on Borders history and gave many talks. As a sportsman he was keen on
golf, tennis and rugby, serving as medical officer for many years at
Kelso Rugby Club and at Kelso Races.
Dr Trainer is survived by his wife Marjorie, son John and daughter
Lorraine.

Rex Walters, actor and drama professor: an appreciation
THE name of Rex Walters, who has died at 87, will remind an older
generation of an outstanding man of the theatre who spread his talents
over a wide area.
Though he became Professor of Drama at the Guildhall School of Music
and Drama, Walters was tempted by another career in his early life in
Birmingham when he showed high promise as a cricketer and played for
Warwickshire.
As understudy to England's wicketkeeper, Tiger Smith, he decided
however to move on to more principal roles as an actor, in his
developing love of the theatre.
After early appearances in Hamlet and Cymberline, he toured with Sir
Barry Jackson's Company, playing the lead in productions like Bird in
the Hand and The Truth Game.
Moving on to production as well as acting, he took a touring company
to present Shakespearean plays in 39 American states.
Rex Walters then spread himself successfully to films and broadcasting
and worked with Alexander Korda on Knight Without Armour. Until the
Second World War he was director and producer of the Theatre Royal,
Bath.
But if drama was his profession, it became part of real life when he
joined the RAF in 1940, worked in counter-intelligence and was liaising
with the Maquis in France when his group suffered heavily at Arnhem.
Walters was attending a secret meeting in a farmhouse when the Germans
approached. He donned a nightgown and was bundled into bed with a huge
Frenchman, when the Germans entered the room, put on the light, made
their apologies and left. He claimed the experience put him off garlic
for all time!
After the war he was known for producing variety shows but became
Professor of Drama at the Guildhall in 1950, gaining a high reputation
as brilliant teacher and examiner and imparting his own love of theatre
to another generation.
His first wife, Enid Clark, by whom he had one son, died in 1964 and
he married Joan Merrill in 1969.

Don Blair, company director, born February 7, 1928, died September 30,
1995.
DON Blair's career with Babcock Energy spanned development work on
some of Britain's pioneering power stations, including Peterhead,
Chapelcross at Annan, Cockenzie, Calderhall (now Sellafield), and Drax
in Yorkshire.
Born in Glasgow, he spent some of his early childhood at the family
croft on Lewis, and enjoyed returning there later in life. His time in
the Hebrides also enabled him to become a fluent Gaelic speaker.
Mr Blair, who lived in Milngavie for two decades but died at his new
home in Skelmorlie, Ayrshire, was educated at Allan Glen's school in
Glasgow.
He undertook National Service with the Argyll and Sutherland
Highlanders in occcupied Germany immediately after the Second World War.
On his return to the UK, he joined Babcock and Wilcox in 1949, and
served the company -- and its successor, Babcock Energy -- for all but
three of the next 42 years.
He spent five years in Kuwait, three years in the West Indies, and
five years working from Babcock's London office.
Between 1970 and 1973, he worked for Simon Engineering in
Gloucestershire, before returning to his original employer until his
retirement in 1991, after holding the post of director of project
operations, working on contracts for electricity utilities across the
globe.
A Babcock spokesman said yesterday: ''Don was a dedicated and much
respected ambassador for the company throughout the world, and his
former colleagues are greatly saddened by his death.''
Mr Blair was a keen footballer in his younger days, captaining the
North of Scotland schoolboys' side, and appearing for St Mirren's
reserve team.
He is survived by his mother, Mrs Kate Blair, who now lives in
Inverness and was 100 this year, wife Annette, son Iain, grand-daughter
Anastasia, and three brothers.

Archibald Charles McKay, Sheriff of Glasgow and Strathkelvin 1979-95;
born Antrim, October 18, 1929, died Glasgow, October 2, 1995.
ARCHIBALD Charles McKay died after a short illness which he confronted
with calm determination and fortitude.
Sheriff McKay was born in Antrim in 1929 and was educated initially in
Knocknacarry. His secondary education was completed at St Aloysius
College, Glasgow. He went on to Glasgow University where he graduated
MA, LL B.
After National Service, with commissioned rank in the Royal Army
Service Corps, he qualified as a solicitor in 1957 and set up his own
practice four years later.
A founder member of the Glasgow Bar Association, he was elected
President for 1967-68 and during his term of office he chaired on
television, an important ''Teach-In,'' as the contemporary phrase had
it, on urban violence.
After distinguished practice as a solicitor specialising in sheriff
court work, he was elevated to the Bench in 1978.
For a few months he was a ''floating sheriff'' with jurisdiction
throughout Scotland. But in January, 1979, he was transferred to Glasgow
where he sat until the onset of his final illness earlier this year.
As a judge, Sheriff McKay was noted for his meticulous thoroughness,
fairness and promptness. His courtesy on the Bench was a by-word. His
judgments were rarely appealed and still more, rarely appealed
successfully.
The narration of Archie McKay's distinguished legal and public life
tells us little about the man. Behind the patient and courteous public
face was a man of diverse interests, unique personality and profound
faith.
Although it was in the Army that he served his country during National
Service, he was later in life a keen and skilled flier of light
aircraft.
In his forties he startled his legal colleagues by arriving by plane
at the annual general meeting of the Law Society of Scotland in
Aviemore. Some 20 years later he took time to fly an elderly friend on
pilgrimage to the battlefields of Ypres.
He also was an enthusiastic motorcyclist, tennis player and amateur
radio enthusiast. Even during his final illness he motorcycled to
Switzerland and back and only weeks ago held some of his fellow sheriffs
at bay on the tennis court.
In conversation his ready wit, always acute but never unkind, provided
evidence of a powerful intellect and a deep humanity.
Every ready to advance a cherished principle, he was nevertheless
always open to weigh and consider the opposite view and respect the
integrity of others.
Archie McKay was blessed in a long and happy married life. With his
wife and family he might have expected a long and active retirement. As
it was he only survived his formal retirement date for a fortnight.
In his last weeks the profound faith which had sustained him
throughout life also enabled him to look upon death in a way which made
his friends feel humble.
Archie McKay is survived by his wife Ernestine, his son Timothy, and
his daughters, Frances, Oonagh, and Ernestine.

ICOULDN'T believe it. ''If there is a doctor travelling with us, could
you please come forward and make yourself known to the cabin crew.''
This was about the only thing that could ruin the flight.
For years I've sympathised with people as they moaned about delays at
Bangkok making them late for the connection at Singapore, and you know
what the baggage claims is like at Frankfurt! Never having travelled
widely, they made jet lag seem like some sort of reversion to
adolescence: waking up at midday, feeling exhausted all afternoon, then
coming to just in time for the Australian soaps. All it lacked was the
experimentation with soft drugs.
By the time my first long-haul flight came along, I was dreading it. I
imagined me staggering into Sydney feeling awful, recovering only after
a 24-hour sleep. How wrong I was. What a cinch these flights are. The
plane was huge, and best of all we all had our own televisions. The TV
had 21 video channels, 14 radio channels, and, joy of joys, a selection
of 12 Nintendo games that you could download on to your console as and
when you wanted. If I were to choose the circumstances where I would be
shut up in an enclosed space, then one with computer games, records, and
videos, plus free beer would be pretty much my idea of heaven. Most men
would be happy to stay there for the entire holiday! A clothes shop
would probably make it ideal for the average woman too.
I was having a great time. Experienced travellers can blab on all they
like about the best way to cope with long flights. The in-flight
magazine had some ''expert'' telling us not to drink too much, because
it might make you dehydrated. Boo hoo. Only wussies worry about
dehydration. Guys who worry about being ''a bit dehydrated'' are
precisely the kind of blokes who become air-travel experts instead of
getting a real job. It wasn't long before the beer hostess was wearing a
path to and from my seat.
BY the time two hours had passed, I was quite ''relaxed''. I'd
demonstrated my ineptitude in every one of the Nintendo games and had
even got over my irritation at the guy on my left. Never ever tell
anyone how much you've paid for your plane ticket. The only kind of git
who asks this is the sort whose brother-in-law works for the airline;
the kind of git who probably paid less for his ticket than you paid for
a taxi to the airport. Anyway, I'd recovered from this, eaten my dinner,
and decided that after a few more beers it would be about time to watch
Rob Roy on the video. (You couldn't tell Liam Neeson wasn't Scottish.
Not with dialogue like ''Bejaysus Moira. There's nae porridge left!'')
Things were going great until the call spoiled everything.
Once the ''Is there a doctor in the house'' call is made an immediate
clinical assessment is needed. Three things should make a doctor spring
into action: someone in a panic, blood, or a supermodel in need of
medical attention. If none of these factors is present, the best thing
to do is sit tight and let some over-eager medical student sort it out.
(If there is a Mr Brandon Lee travelling with us . . .)
There are good reasons for holding back: any self-respecting physician
will be reluctant to breathe beery fumes over someone who is fully
conscious and not at all unwell -- not professionally anyway. The
practised doc will be feigning deep sleep by the time the stewardess has
fnished the sentence. (If ever you're in the position where someone
calls a doctor for you, my advice is to knock back the first three
candidates: a doc's willingness to show off in public is inversely
proportional to his capacity to do anything useful.) So far there was no
panic. I settled back to the film.
Two calls later (still no panic and no blood, I might add) I was the
loser in this game of Medical Chicken. As I popped my head round the
curtain, I discovered what the emergency was. One of the stewards had
cut his arm on a knife. I'd eaten my dinner, I knew how blunt they were.
Anyone who had cut flesh with one of those knives should have been given
an award, even if it was a centimetre long.
Basically they wanted a trained medic to put a sticky-plaster on the
cut. Which should have been easy, but they didn't have any. Out of two
full medicine cabinets, there was the equipment for delivering a baby,
treating a heart attack, or (and I'm not joking) acute malaria. But no
plasters. It's all right. I coped.
After dealing calmly and efficiently with this serious case, the staff
were grateful and filled my glass up with even greater frequency.
By the time we landed I had a sore head, dry tongue, and felt quite
sick for about two days. That dehydration's a terrible thing.

THE takeover battle for oil and gas exploration and production group
Aran Energy looks likely to hot up, it emerged yesterday.
Aran, which is currently fighting a #161m bid by Atlantic Richfield
Corp (Arco), of the US, said it had been approached by another company,
which might lead to a rival offer being put on the table.
Aran said the other potential bidder had asked for information on the
Dublin-based oil company.
''Shareholders will be kept informed of developments: in the meantime,
they are advised to take no action,'' it said.
An independent valuation earlier this week said Aran was worth #290m,
according to the group, although Arco dismissed the claim.

CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS
SCOTTISHPOWER'S hostile bid for Manweb on July 24 came as no surprise.
Privatised six months after the Chester-based electricity distributor
in June 1991, ScottishPower needed to look elsewhere for profits' growth
as it neared the end of its own post-privatisation cost-cutting
programme.
Ahead of the expiry of the Government's ''golden share'' in the
regional electricity companies (RECs) on March 31, Trafalgar House was
the first to mount a bid.
On December 19 last year, Trafalgar announced an ultimately
unsuccessful #1200m hostile bid for Newcastle-based Northern Electric.
However, the sparks have only really begun to fly in the electricity
sector during the last few months. Joining in the rush to bid for a UK
REC, ScottishPower sacrificed the opportunity to offer for Australian
electricity distributor United Energy.
The removal of the Government's single #1 share in Manweb, which
prevented one shareholder owning more than 15%, was ratified at the
Chester-based company's annual meeting on August 2.
Five days later, ScottishPower launched its formal offer document and
started the 60-day bid clock ticking down to yesterday's successful
conclusion.
On August 31, president of the Board of Trade Ian Lang unexpectedly
declined to refer the ScottishPower bid to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
His decision was in line with the advice of the Office of Fair Trading
but was considered to have seriously undermined the position of
electricity regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild, who had argued for
a referral.
On September 15, the City gave the thumbs-down to Manweb's proposed
550p-a-share defence package, even though it was larger than expected.
The package would have been worth 605p to institutional shareholders,
after tax credits were taken into account.
Three days later, ScottishPower raised its hostile bid by a modest
#60m to #1100m.
Then, on September 20, Manweb surprised the stock market with the
announcement it was holding takeover talks with an unidentified overseas
rival to ScottishPower.
Eight days ago, it revealed that talks with the potential white
knight, by this time known to be US power company PacifiCorp, had
collapsed. The ScottishPower bid was unstoppable.

ANALYSIS OF THE TAKEOVER
BEFORE it announced its surprise bid for Manweb last July,
ScottishPower had plenty of reasons for feeling defensive about its own
ability to remain an independent company, longer term.
Internally it had done some exciting things to benchmark its
operations against global best practice. The resultant cost savings were
running at the rate of #69m a year. As a result ScottishPower could
claim to be the lowest-cost distributor anywhere in the UK. The
corporate culture had been transformed.
But, confronted by much tougher price controls than the regional
supply companies in the south, the Glasgow-based group's prospects of
really putting a firm boot on the growth accelerator were in doubt.
The margins to be made from grabbing commercial and industrial
contracts in the unregulated sectors of the supply market across the UK
were thin. Pumping even more excess power into the English pool had to
await the further (costly) upgrading of the grid interconnector.
In the early years of privatisation, the company had been slow to
dabble in innovative generating or distribution projects. With plenty of
surplus generating capacity already on its books -- like the oil-fired
Inverkip station which only ever produced power during the miners'
strike and the elderly Kincardine coal-fired station -- it looked
askance at things like the rash of schemes to build new gas-fired
turbine stations.
A number of projects -- a station in Hampshire turning domestic waste
into electricity; a plan to re-equip London Underground's own power
stations; a proposed submarine cable with the Isle of Man -- all failed
to make it off the drawing board.
Later projects did materialise. The 41 megawatt Knapton gas-fired
station in Yorkshire is now on stream. The joint venture with Japanese
and Californian partners in Europe's largest windfarm, at Penrhyddlan in
Mid-Wales produces up to 31 megawatts. The biggest prize of all, the
proposed submarine link from Ayrshire to Northern Ireland, has been one
of the hardest fought environmental battles of recent years and is still
in the hands of the public inquiry reporter.
Away from electricity generation and supply, ScottishPower showed a
determination to grow through diversification. An opportunistic deal
with the Clydesdale Group receivers put its retail arm into the national
UK league, at a time when many of the English RECs were pulling out of
retailing altogether.
The joint venture gas supply company Caledonian Gas is one of the
larger independent players, supplying more than 6000 sites across the
UK. But it is in a crowded and intensely competitive marketplace.
ScottishTelecom, the newest communications business, is investing
heavily in a fibre optic network, principally linking the Edinburgh and
Glasgow conurbations. But it is in the investment (#27m in the last
accounts) rather than the money-making phase.
In all these diversifications, ScottishPower has long realised that
growing the business organically is a slow process. In last year's
accounts, retail accounted for just #199m of the #1716m group turnover.
And just #9.9m of the #380m operating profit.
Other, non-electricity businesses made a contribution to external
sales of just #55m and lost ScottishPower, in total, some #2m. Whatever
their long-term potential, it was clear these businesses would not have
a dramatic impact on the bottom line for a long time.
The ScottishPower executive team -- both the old team which brought
the business through from the public sector and the newcomers, like
chief executive Ian Robinson and finance director Ian Russell, who were
increasingly taking control -- knew, no matter how unwilling they are to
admit it in public, that such slow progress left them vulnerable.
Industry professionals had concluded long ago that the Government's
pre-privatisation structure -- 17 separate generating and supply
companies across the country -- would not long survive the expiry of
government golden shares. ''I always thought we would get down to about
six groups in the end,'' one former senior executive told me this week.
So, when Trafalgar first mounted its hostile bid for Northern, one of
the English RECs, the writing was on the wall. Deals and restructuring
were going to happen anyway. So better initiate a takeover yourself and,
in the process, add a new dimension to your growth prospects, than wait
around for other predators to knock on your own door.
ScottishPower's timing was immaculate. Its target was judiciously
chosen as the one English REC which had neither addressed its cost base
nor seriously attempted growth by diversification. Bar the Prudential,
ScottishPower's offer swayed almost all Manweb's institutional
shareholders. But whether through apathy or loyalty, most small
shareholders sat on their hands.
There was luck along the way. No one could have predicted for certain
that the new President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang would give the
ScottishPower bid the green light without a Monopolies and Mergers
Commission inquiry. No one could have predicted for certain how quickly
the whole sector would erupt with other bids and deals.
With Manweb, ScottishPower has virtually doubled its customer base
overnight and walks into a business ripe for the same kind of cost
savings it has shown it can achieve in its own operations here in
central and southern Scotland.
If the industry is going to end up as five or six groups, the enlarged
ScottishPower now looks certain to be one of them.

TONY BLAIR'S vision of us all being linked to the Internet should be
compared not so much with Harold Wilson's ''white heat of technology''
but more with George Orwell. Having already lobotomised the Labour Party
and the BBC, we cannot now be far from the privilege of Blair's press
chief, Alistair Campbell, sending hourly messages into our e-mail
addresses, little homilies from the Leader which we will dutifully type
out 100 times on our personal laptop computers.
As we approach the third millennium, however, we should not be
surprised. This is the Age of Bizarre, of the cult where groups of
people huddle on high ground to escape the wreak of devastation. We can
already see it on Edinburgh's Calton Hill, where a small group has been
gathered round its braziers since the last election waiting for the God
of Devolution. To fulfil the prophecy, of course, there first must come
Armeggedon -- and that has been pencilled in with some confidence, it is
1997.
Norman Cohn, in his famous book The Pursuit of the Millennium, might
have been writing about New Labour when he wrote: ''A boundless,
millennial promise made with boundless, prophet-like conviction to a
number of rootless and desperate men in the midst of a society where
traditional norms and relationships are disintegrating -- here, it would
seem, lay the source of that peculiar subterranean fanaticism which
subsisted as a perpetual menace to the structure of society. No doubt
some of these people were megalomanics and others were imposters and
many were both at once -- but to all of them one thing is common: each
claimed to be charged with the unique mission of bringing history to its
pre-ordained consummation.''
The Tories, when they meet in Blackpool next week, might well ponder
on this. Having been in power for 16 years they are unable to press the
linguistic buttons which Labour can to penetrate deep into the public
consciousness. Everything about Labour is ''new'' or has been
''renewed''. It is ''young'', as are its policies, and even Britain is
''youthful''. This all represents Apocalypse Now for Mr Major unless he
can Waco-like exterminate this cult.
Where Tony Blair has ravaged the thoughts of Newt Gingrich, Mr Major
can usefully borrow from another American, Bill Clinton -- ''It's the
economy, stupid.'' For this is the battleground which the Tories have
surrendered to the false god of monetary union. As David Sanders,
Professor of Government at Essex University, has suggested in his recent
study, the fact of which remains uppermost in people's minds in an
election, is the perceived economic competence of the parties.
This is not just a question of cutting taxes or about celebrating
Britain's economic growth for the past three years. Ever since we
unceremoniously fell out of the European exchange rate mechanism the
public lost its trust in the Conservatives' ability to handle the
nation's finances. Unless that trust can be regained, all is lost.
At this coming week's conference it will be easy to dream up figures
to cost what little we know of Labour's programme. It will be simple to
attack the convoluted thinking about public and private financial
partnerships on the railways -- look at the success of just such a
union, Eurotunnel, which has reported losses of #450m, almost on a par
with your average nationalised industry. It is not difficult to be
scornful of the policies on education and devolution. But Blair has
created an image of a new tomorrow, an ectoplasm, which to some offers a
convincing future, especially in the abscence of an alternative.
Mr Major, as most people keep saying, is never better than when his
back is to the wall. This may, of course, be a result of it having been
there for so long. However, he did demonstrate, in the face of the
sneers of the political pundits, that he was right to plump for a
leadership election to clear the air. Having done so the issue which has
crippled the party since Mrs Thatcher, that of Europe, is now moving his
way. The Euro rebels in his own party will for the first time give him
an easy ride at the conference. On the Continent the scepticism over a
single currency is widespread. Some governments may want it -- the
people, without exception, do not.
Here then is Mr Major's opportunity. He has good Euro-sceptical
credentials based on his various opt-outs. He can wave the Union flag
with vigour -- which is always good for conference morale -- and at the
same time pander shamelessly to the growing anti-Europeanism among the
electorate at large. He can demand a single market but not a single
currency; he can attack the European Court as a haven for IRA killers;
he can criticise Europe for its intrusion in our weights and measures
and its lack of interference in Bosnia. Best of all he can brand Labour
as slaves of Europe willing to sell out the # for a dodgy ecu and for
letting the Bundesbank determine mortgage rates instead of the British
Government.
At the same time he might like to point out that Labour is not as
''new'' as it likes to make out. The Robin Cooks, the Gordon Browns, the
John Prescotts were the self-same people who were around when Michael
Foot and Neil Kinnock took their drubbings. The emperor does not have
any new clothes.
Having secured himself at the helm of the Tory party, Mr Major should
usher in his own bright boys. Like John Redwood, who rightly claimed
this week that he has been talking about the Internet and reductions in
VAT on fuel, long before Labour. Like Michael Portillo, who was
ludicrously confined to Defence when he is one of the few in the party
capable of linking Tory traditionalism with a radical right-wing agenda.
There is no use fighting an election with words like millennium
buzzing about and relying on yesterday's men to counter them. Michael
Heseltine is one of the few with charisma, but even he is due his buss
pass soon. Michael Howard and Ken Clarke never had any.
Labour has been behaving at its conference like David Steel once
foolishly did -- urging supporters to return to their constituencies and
prepare for government. The reality is that Labour will have to go
through it all again next year. It will have to scale the heights once
more, only this time Mr Major must ensure it has to carry the extra
burden of policies. It is these which will drag Labour into the abyss.

CROFTERS TRUST
THE Assynt Crofters Trust, which bought its own estate in 1993, plans
to generate its own electricity.
It has applied for European Objective One financing for the scheme
which will involve producing 255 kilowatts of power, which will be sold
to the National Grid.
The idea was inspired by a Scottish Office announcement in December
1994 that Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric would need 76
megawatts of new electricity to be generated from renewable sources.
Now the trust has won a contract to supply the National Grid for 15
years from April, 1996.
The finance from it will be used to employ a full-time project officer
to look after the running of the estate and allow the trust directors to
pursue other development opportunities.
It is the latest imaginative move by the crofters who purchased the
North Lochinver estate for #300,000 from the Scandinavian consortium
which owned it.
And it is providing the role model for the campaign for more crofting
land to be returned to the crofters, rather than remain in the hands of
absentee landlords.
The electricity scheme will cost more than the purchase price, but the
trust has introduced several other measures to provide an income for the
estate and its development.
It has leased property to an information technology company and is
about to start fencing a section of the estate to establish a mixed
forestry plantation on 162 hectares near the village of Achmelvich.
Trust director John MacKenzie said: ''The scheme has been examined
thoroughly by consultants, with computer modelling of all aspects to
ensure it survives for the length of the contract. We are confident it
will work.''
Matching funds from an unidentified source has been fixed up which
should unlock European cash to finance the venture.
Mr MacKenzie continued: ''Our plan involves raising the level of Loch
Poll, which lies between Drumbeg and Clashnessie, by two metres to
increase the water storage capacity.
''Then a pipeline will take the water to the turbine house at the
bottom of Fank Brae. We are having talks with conservation bodies to
ensure that our plans do not have any adverse effects on the
environment.''
He added that the hydro scheme was an example of the trust's
continuing efforts to diversify the income-earning potential of the
estate's assets.
''When we bought the estate's assets, we knew there were few natural
resources that could be used for the benefit of the crofters without
them being used up very quickly.
''Here is one that, despite the dry summer we have had, can be used
almost without worrying about replenishing the raw material.''

The English may be snobs, but Scots suffer from a worship of
working-class values which is essentially nostalgic and regressive,
states Graeme Woolaston.
LET me begin by making clear what I am not advocating. Last year I was
at a dinner party in Brighton, where I lived for most of the 1980s. I
was speaking so favourably of the town, of which I have many happy
memories, I was asked why I had left. I explained that I hadn't so much
wanted to leave Brighton, as return to Scotland. This provoked a blank
response, so I explained further. I wanted to go back to the country in
which I grew up. I saw that this produced a still greater blankness.
Fearing I had committed the faux pas of talking too seriously at the
dinner table, I changed the subject.
But the incident nagged at me. At first I was inclined to attribute
the lack of understanding of what I was saying to the widespread English
inability to accept that Scotland is a different country. But gradually
I realised there was another explanation. I had been among people for
whom the very idea of ''going back'' to where you came from was
incomprehensible. The essential meaning of their adult lives was that
they had put their origins behind them in every way -- and most
obviously, in their voices. All my fellow guests spoke with the
South-east accent which the English acquire when they reject their
native accents as too ''regional''.
Now it is true that we were all gay men at that dinner table, and
re-inventing yourself in the midst of heterosexual society is a
universal rite of passage for every gay man and lesbian. But I was
certain that that alone was not the source of the blankness which had
confronted my talk of ''going home''. I know too many heterosexuals in
England whose response would have been exactly the same. This was an
English cultural reality I was facing, not a gay one.
Ironically I might very easily have been such an Englishman myself,
for though by descent I am both Scots and English, I was born in
Leicester. Only the chance of a new posting for my father when I was
still a toddler took us to Scotland, so that I grew up to be a
half-English Scot, rather than the other way round. Had I remained in
Leicester, no doubt in due course I too would have moved away, changed
my accent, and become another south-easterner puzzled by the wish of a
Scot to ''go home''.
Here, surely, is an illustration of a major social difference between
the two countries. In Scotland it is not normal to turn your back on
where you came from. It is not standard to alter your accent radically,
to disguise your origins. It is not considered freakish to remain in
touch with where you started in life -- so that, for example, you may
become a solicitor or a doctor and still attend the same football ground
you went to as a child.
And all of this is massively in Scotland's favour. No-one who has
experienced the labyrinthine complexities of English snobbery and its
all-pervasive presence in English daily life would wish to import it
north of the Border. The absence of such a highly structured snobbery is
one of the many features which make Scotland a more agreeable society to
live in than the English South-east.
But there is, unfortunately, a downside to this. There is, in
Scotland, a mythologising of the working class as a source of core
values, almost as a touchstone of spiritual authenticity, which is
self-indulgent, absurd, and arguably harmful to the nation.
Now, let me emphasise again that I am not urging the importation of
the English obsession with social climbing. I grew up as a working-class
boy and I still live in a predominantly working-class area. The
protagonist of my most recent novel is a working-class gay man, a very
rare phenomenon in British writing. I have not the slightest desire to
reject my own background -- but equally I have no desire to
sentimentalise it either.
The Scottish cult of the working class is essentially nostalgic and
regressive. It is ultimately a cult of mediocrity and failure, of
ignorance and the bigotries that are born of ignorance. It is an
expression of hostility to the modern world, to the life of the
intellect, and to success in every form.
It is nostalgic, because though I have been using the phrase ''working
class'' as if it were unproblematic, in fact it is a highly fluid term.
Is a tradesman with his own business who owns or is buying his own home
''working class''? In Scotland -- and I have no problem with this -- the
answer is usually ''yes'', because the culture of such a man (or woman)
remains distinctively working class. But, of course, this is not the
class which is sentimentalised. The skilled working class, enterprising
and hard working, is very nearly invisible in the mythology of
contemporary Scotland.
But then the cult isn't interested in anyone who is successful in
contemporary Scotland. It's far keener on the working class of 40 or 50
or 60 years ago, who lived in tenements and went to Hampden in droves
and did nothing so problematic as take out a mortgage. The
identification of spiritual authenticity with proletarian values
involves a strong regard for the past, from which disturbing features
such as violence and sectarianism are often airbrushed away.
Our literature takes note of contemporary reality not only by
overlooking the embarrassing fact of home ownership among people who
ought to be sleeping 15 to a bed in a single-end, but by very nearly
overlooking the world of work altogether. If future generations of Scots
try to form a picture of our society by reading our fiction, they will
form a most peculiar idea of our time. They will have no idea that 92%
of the Scottish workforce were not unemployed. They may even think that
the only people who had jobs at all were unsympathetic social workers.
And because the skilled working class have values which don't fit the
requirements of the mythology, attention focuses on the underclass who
remain satisfyingly proletarian.
Now here again is a potential virtue converted into a vice. It is good
and right that our literature should not exclude attention to the
alienated urban underclass, as is the case with the literature of
England. But our literature is exclusive in a different way -- it
virtually ignores the Scottish middle class.
This point was made forcibly in David Hall's recent essay in this
series, ''The duty of a novelist'': ''It is no exaggeration to claim
that all classes other than the working class are seriously
under-fictionalised in West of Scotland literature . . . The middle or
upper classes rarely appear in novels, and when they do, it is in two
dimensions (or less).'' Hall was absolutely correct. A typical reader of
The Herald would find it nearly impossible to come across a contemporary
novel which deals with the conditions of his or her life as a
middle-class Scot.
Hall tended to hold writers themselves responsible for this situation,
but I believe the blame lies much more with the way in which literature
is marketed. Scottish writers take a major gamble when they place
middle-class characters central to a novel. Such a novel has to struggle
to be accepted as authentically ''Scottish''; indeed, it is by no means
inconceivable that a writer of Scottish fiction concentrating on
middle-class characters might find it impossible to get into print at
all, and give up in despair. The influence of fashion on what is
recognised as ''literature'' should never be underestimated.
But literature is not the only art-form in Scotland which is affected
by the idea that the working class is the source of ''Scottishness''. It
produces a curious effect on acting standards in Scotland. It's
surprisingly rare to come across an actor who can speak with a realistic
urban Scottish accent. Time and again the accent comes out sounding
false, for the reason that it is exaggerated both in tonality and
vocabulary. Because the working class must be ''Scots'' through and
through, the pretence is made that their speech is radically different
from standard English.
But the truth is that ''urban Scots'' is in some ways closer to
standard English than the dialect of, for example, my native Midlands.
Consider, for example, the inflection of the verb ''to be''. ''I were
glad it were there'' reflects an ancient linguistic division. ''I wis
glad it wis there'' is simply a variant pronunciation. Kelman, whose ear
for Glasgow speech is flawless, never makes the mistake of exaggerating
its Scottishness.
The fundamental objection to the cult of proletarian values is that it
is, at the end of the day, part and parcel of the Scottish cult of
failure. This is not because working-class people are failures; it is
because the moment they have the effrontery to be successful, they are
promptly excluded from the cult.
Perhaps the single most troubling feature of contemporary Scotland is
its absolute intolerance of success. To some extent this is an aspect of
Britishness; the country as a whole could do with importing the high
American valuation of success. But on this subject there is a difference
in kind, not merely degree, between England and Scotland. In England, to
be successful is a faux pas. In Scotland it's a hanging offence.
One has to encounter at first hand the sheer hatred which is directed
against any Scot who dares to be successful, in any field, to credit its
viciousness. It's not the normal dislike for people who start putting on
airs and graces, which is a natural human emotion. It's an objection to
the very fact of anyone having achieved anything with their life. The
only people who seem to be exempted are businessmen who buy football
clubs, who are immediately forgiven for having made money.
The most famous victim of this syndrome must be Billy Connolly. A
healthy society would be delighted by someone who has made his way in
life by possession of an outstanding talent. Instead he was sneered at
endlessly for having royal friends, and derided for trying to make an
impact in America. No wonder he chooses to live furth of Scotland. And
no wonder he is not alone in that. Again and again successful Scots quit
the country. And who can blame them? Why would they want to stay in a
society where they attract little but spite and envy?
Scotland cannot afford this cult of failure any longer. It cannot go
on believing its soul resides precisely in the class who are left behind
-- even if through no fault of their own -- when others have moved on by
making use of the opportunities opened to them by skill or enterprise or
intellectual effort. It cannot afford these things, if it is to be a
successful self-governing nation.
My own preference for Scotland's future is independence. There is no
paradox in a half-Englishman, sharing a surname with one of Edward I's
knights, adopting such a stance; I, of all people, know just how
different Scotland and England are. And perhaps I bring to my Scottish
nationalism something of the arrogance of an Englishman. Certainly I
seem to be genetically immune from the Scottish cringe, and from the
deformations of sentimentality which accompany it. And the worst of
these is the cult of proletarian values. The role models for a new
Scotland must be those people, of every class, who are ambitious and
have the determination to achieve their ambitions. They are the bedrock
of any successful country, anywhere.

<HEADLINE>Majority of shareholders accept #1100m offer for Merseyside utility. ScottishPower savours the victory</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISHPOWER breathed a sigh of relief yesterday as its hostile
#1100m bid for Manweb was accepted by a clear majority of shareholders
in the Chester-based electricity company.
By the time the offer closed at 1pm, ScottishPower had secured control
of 60% of Manweb, which distributes electricity in Merseyside and North
Wales.
''We are delighted with the positive response from Manweb
shareholders,'' said ScottishPower chief executive Ian Robinson as the
bid was declared unconditional.
Manweb shareholders who have not yet sold out have until October 20 to
accept the cash-plus-shares offer, now worth 1011p, or the all-cash
alternative of 990p.
''We strongly urge all remaining Manweb shareholders to accept it
without delay,'' Mr Robinson said.
Manweb chief executive John Roberts said ScottishPower's victory in
the takeover battle was ''a disappointment'', but he pledged to
co-operate in transferring control of his company to its new owners.
Manweb bitterly opposed ScottishPower's bid every inch of the way,
denouncing it as ''mean''.
But its last-minute attempt to negotiate a rival deal with the US
power company PacifiCorp fell through a week ago, making its takeover by
ScottishPower virtually inevitable.
City analysts described ScottishPower's bid as fair, but not generous,
and a handful of institutional investors refused to accept it. The
refuseniks included Prudential Corporation, whose 8.5% stake in Manweb
is the largest held by any institutional investor.
Yesterday's count of acceptances showed that shareholders owning 32%
of Manweb had agreed ScottishPower's offer. But ScottishPower already
owned a 28% stake in Manweb, built up over the last two months through
purchases on the open market.
Adam Forsyth, an electricity analyst with Natwest Securities in
Edinburgh, said the acceptance rate was ''perhaps a bit on the low
side''.
But he added: ''It passes the the 50% mark which is the main thing and
I would now expect other people to sell out.''
ScottishPower executives are due to meet Manweb directors on Monday to
discuss a transfer of control.
A special team of about 20 ScottishPower managers led by Mike Kinski,
the executive director of corporate resources, has been standing by for
several weeks ready to move in.
Once ScottishPower moves into Manweb it will be under heavy pressure
to prove quickly that it really can make the company more efficient than
it was under independent management.
But finance director Ian Russell tried to dispel fears among Manweb
customers and employees that ScottishPower would move straight in with a
butcher's knife.
He said ScottishPower's first priority was to put the business back on
an even keel after two months of uncertainty.
Mr Russell said it would take ''a period of months'' for ScottishPower
to get the feel of its acquisition and pledged that it would not rush
into immediate changes.
''Until we are in through the front door we won't know quite what we
will find,'' he said.
One of ScottishPower's first moves will undoubtedly be to scale down
Manweb's head office to eliminate duplication with its own.
About 700 of Manweb's 3,000 staff work at the company's headquarters
in Chester.
Bill McCall, of broker Tilney in Edinburgh, predicted that the
headquarters contingent would be cut to less than 150 people within a
year. Over a longer period up to 1,500 jobs would probably be shed, he
added.
Mr Forsyth at Natwest Securities said ScottishPower would probably try
to beat Manweb's own profit forecast of #127.2m before exceptional items
in this financial year to demonstrate its ability to cut costs.
''ScottishPower will be looking to beat that forecast,'' he said.
''That is is the sort of publicity they need and it is achievable.''
A London-based electricity analyst, who declined to be named,
estimated that ScottishPower would be able to achieve cost savings of
#35m at Manweb over the next three years, in addition to those already
planned by the Manweb's board.
Large job losses at Manweb were inevitable whether or not the
ScottishPower bid succeeded. Manweb's unsuccessful defence package had
promised #46m of additional savings in this financial year ending on
March 31 1996 and a further #61m in 1996/97.
It never spelt out how these would be achieved, but it was universally
assumed that further staff reductions would be the main element.
Mr Russell said ScottishPower would focus on integrating Manweb and
developing ScottishPower business in Scotland ''for the next year or
two'' before starting to look for further large acquisitions.
ScottishPower abandoned plans to bid for United Energy, a power
distribution company in the Australian state of Victoria in order to bid
for Manweb on July 24.
The Glasgow-based company raised its initial #1040m bid by a further
#60m on September 18 after Manweb offered its shareholders a benefits
package worth 550p per share.
But despite the last minute threat from a potential white knight,
ScottishPower managed to finesse the institutional investors without
putting more money on the table.
It has cost the company about #34m to mount the bid for Manweb.
Indirectly it will also have to pick up the tab for Manweb's failed
defence, estimated to have cost a further #10m to #15m.
ScottishPower shares closed up 6p at 358p, while Manweb was up 10p at
1005p.

A CONCHOLOGIST, I appreciated the photo of boxed seashells grouped in
fancy patterns and sold for #1350 (September 23). In some instances they
have fetched a price of #5000.
The Sailors' Valentines -- as they are known -- were made by seamen
who gathered shells, coloured them using dye, created designs and
encased them as mosaics, then presented them to their sweetheart. Anyone
interested in viewing splendid specimens can see examples in Greenock's
museum and can purchase a card showing a beautiful illustration.
Seashells have been used voluminously in many ways since ancient
times. A widespread Roman purpose was ornamental with scallop shapes,
and this shell was utilised in heraldry. The Victorian age saw famous
collections and collectors. Captain James Cook returned with many
rarities.
The Imperial Harp's origin was once a mystery. Captain William Bligh,
of HMS Bounty fame, brought a specimen back from Mauritius around 1810
thus establishing the correct provenance of this species.
Seashells are past and present proof of nature's intrinsic beauty.

THE thud of the junk mail is getting ever louder on the doormat as
winter gathers in. It is a harvest of appeals, fliers, publicity sheets,
and order forms. We all get our share, but clergymen get more than most.
First there are the charities which hope we will commend their work or
allocate retiring collections (it surely cannot be that they regard
clergymen as a source of wealth to be tapped?). Then there are the
internal church mailings. The Church of Scotland is particularly
generous in this regard.
Yesterday I received a prayer letter, but along with that delivery
came another envelope of papers for the next Presbytery meeting which
contained the self-same prayer letter. Twice blessed, no doubt, but it
was the Post Office that got twice paid.
However, as well as their monthly Presbytery papers, ministers get
another monthly mailing from 121 George Street. This is much heavier
stuff (in weight if not theological content). My favourite is Ministers
Forum, edited by the Rev James Gilfillan of East Kilbride.
The title is not very exciting but it invariably contains material of
a candid nature. Here you will read what ministers really think, rather
than what they think that other people want them to think. Recently
several contributors handed out a drubbing to a congregation which
published a pompous and self-righteous list of the characteristics which
their new minister would need to possess. My only regret was that that
congregation (and the interim moderator who allowed them to do it) would
probably never read it.
This month's issue contains a moving reflection by the Rev John Cook
-- not the glottal stotter who used to be in Easterhouse but the smooth
fellow who was in Kilmarnock and now in Joppa, Edinburgh. John has
recently undergone a triple heart by-pass and wrote to make three
points.
First, that he was heavily into denial of the symptoms and wanted to
prevent others making the same mistake. Secondly, that it was so easy to
become careless about health (as he did) and neglect diet and exercise.
The third point was the feeling of thankfulness after his operation and
his resolve in future as a hospital visitor to make his visits short --
and always to offer a prayer.
''If I am rebuffed,'' he writes, ''I am big enough to take it. I am
not going to wonder if the offer is appropriate. It is appropriate.''
He heads the article ''Saviour while my heart is tender'', echoing the
words of a hymn. Such articles -- in which writers open their hearts --
are worth 100 sermons in which the preacher follows a predictable
three-point path. However, it is not always possible to do this without
having a dagger plunged in it, by an unsympathetic listener.
I remember attending a wedding reception 20 years ago at which John
Cook officiated. The woman opposite me voiced her disapproval. ''He
preaches sex before marriage from the pulpit,'' she hissed vehemently. I
was certain he had done no such thing, but by talking openly about a
sensitive subject he had convinced this woman that he was a libertine.
Maybe there are some discussions which are better kept behind the
closed doors of a profession. There will always be those whose own
anxieties and critical nature make them react adversely to candour. So
it may well be that the no-punches-pulled disclosures of Ministers Forum
will make it into the kind of publication that is best kept under the
counter and handed out to those who do not suffer from a nervy
disposition.
I cannot help the mischievous thought that it would do a great deal
for some religious publications if they were banned. Human nature being
what it is, interest in them would soar.
What I would love to ban is the practice of grabbing a week and
designating it as ''National Ingrown Toenail Week'' or some such worthy
cause or condition. Most of the topics are highly worthy, but as a
publicity tactic it has become tired and overused. ''One World Week''
will soon be upon us and November brings ''Prisoners' Week'', while next
Saturday BBC Radio 2 has announced ''World of Faith Week'' for the third
year running.
One feature of the latter is Debbie Thrower's after-lunch daily slot
on the topic ''Design your own religion''. It will not go down well in
the Rev Ian Paisley's home. I once heard him preach about the modern
tendency to produce books with titles such as Man's search for God. He
paused while his audience silently agreed that it was indeed a common
topic. Paisley then roared at the top of his voice. ''What nonsense! Man
doesn't search for God! (Pause for dramatic effect.) Man runs away from
God as fast as he can!'' After more pause for dramatic effect, he
continued in a hoarse whisper: ''But here's the wonderful thing . . .
God runs after man!''
You may not be a fan of Paisley's theology or his politics (I am
neither) but I think he has a point here. The depth of our religious
experience is not dependent on our own efforts but comes to us from God.
Sometimes we are tempted to try to increase that experience by
never-mind-the-quality-feel-the-width tactics such as junk mail, special
weeks, rallys or crusades, but in the end the crucial factor remains
whether or not our heart is tender. As John Cook puts it: ''It is when
my heart is tender I can offer it and if I allow it to waste and
atrophy, harden and seize up, then it is no use to me or God.''
Or as the junk mail might say: ''It's 'Heart Replacement Week' every
week.''

* BRUCE WILLIS seems to have finally accepted that audiences want to
see him in action-adventure films. All the posturing and production of
''serious'' movies after his successful transfer from television's
Moonlighting to the big screen has been shelved. The title of his latest
-- Gundown -- says it all.
Written and directed by veteran shoot 'em up expert Walter Hill, the
plot puts Willis solidly centre stage. He is our old friend the
mysterious gun-for-hire who turns up in a small town caught in a violent
war between two Chicago bootlegging mobs.
Willis the gunman hires himself out to both factions in an attempt to
destroy the two crime syndicates. If it all sounds like some spaghetti
Western, think again. Hill based his story on Akira Kurosawa's 1961
samurai epic Yojimbo, moving the action from 1860s Japan to a Texas
border town at the height of America's prohibition era in 1931.
* BETTE MIDLER is talking about starring as Jacqueline Susann, the
author of Valley of the Dolls and other sudsbusters. The film is to be
based on a memoir by Michael Korda in the New Yorker. Susann was
outrageous and willing to join in any stunt to sell a book. Midler has a
matching personality.
* RAQUEL WELCH is narrating a documentary called Sex, Censorship and
the Silver Screen and knows her subject. And also knows just how
complicated it is to be perceived as simply The Body. ''I recently ran
into Cindy Crawford and she said: 'I never knew before I made a movie
how little control I had over it all.'
''I knew exactly what she meant,'' said the lady who has had a long
career for someone who started out in a fur bikini. ''When you start out
they make a bid doo-dah over you because you are sexy, young and
beautiful. But then it doesn't matter -- you still don't have control,
it's all out of your hands.''
So, eventually, are your children. Her actress-daughter Tahnee appears
nude in the next issue of Playboy. But her mother says: I did a Playboy
layout in 1980 but they were carefully posed -- and I had control. They
were no explicit by any means.''
Welsh is now working on an original screenplay about an actress and
her beautiful daughter and said: ''It would be a dramatic comedy and
based loosely on Tahnee and me.''
Welsh is also reprising her role as nasty Diana Stride in The New
Adventures of Superman, giving Dean Cain's caped guy and Teri Hatcher's
Lois Lane difficult times. It is her first fully-fledged villain role
and she says: ''I'm having a great time playing her.''
* LOOK out for Channel 4 to pick-up the TV series Nanny which stars
Fran Drescher and is fast becoming the must-watch (after Frasier)
sit-com in America. Drescher is so popular she's been cast opposite
Robin Williams in the dramatic comedy Jack. Co-stars are Bill Cosby and
Diane Lane.
* Sandra Bullock is not letting us down. The actress who dances to a
salsa beat jumped out of a giant birthday cake wearing an itsy-bitsy
bikini at a birthday party for director Joel Schumacher who is at
present guiding her in the film adaptation of John Grisham's A Time to
Kill.
* FIRST, it was Hill Street Blues, then LA Law and, most recently,
NYPD Blue, and now there is Murder One. Award-winning producer Steve
Bochco's law drama follows a single court case for a whole series. There
will be sub-plots which are concluded each week but the mainstream of
the series will be just one case. Bochco promises that if fans miss a
couple of episodes they will still be able to follow the action.
* ALSO on the way is Space from former X Files producers Glen Morgan
and James Wong. The series has a group of rookie military cadets who
circumstances force into battle against a rather vicious alien race.
Weird is certainly the new US television trend. In Rock From the Sun
that fine actor John Lithgow finds himself as an alien posing as a
physics professor at a Ohio university. And Shaun Cassidy -- remember
him? -- the one-time Hardy Boy and brother of David, has created,
produced and written American Gothic. It stars Gary ''Midnight Caller''
Cole as an evil sheriff in a Deep South town where strange things go on
behind closed doors . . .
Speaking of strange things it looks as though Jack Nicholson will join
Shirley MacLaine in the sequel to Terms of Endearment. You'll remember
that MacLaine won an Oscar for her role as Aurora Greenaway as did
Nicholson for his outing as her overweight astronaut lover. Debra Winger
who played Aura's daughter died in the 1983 movie and in the sequel, The
Evening Star, the focus is on her daughter Melanie played by Juliette
Lewis. Filming begins next month and Nicholson is expected to sign on as
former space jockey Garrett Breedlove in the next few days.
* BRAD Pitt is proving he's not just a pretty boy. His latest movie,
Seven, a gritty detective thriller in which he co-stars with Morgan
Freeman as a pair of homicide cops, is going into its third week as the
number one box office attraction.

WHEN the weekend is over, and you've just has a probably dreich Monday
back at work, and listened to the certainly depressing nine o'clock
news, the perfect programme for your cynical dumps will be broadcast on
Radio 4 at 9.15. Called Whatever Happened To...?, this series take a
look at the after-life of characters from children's fiction.
A brilliant, simple idea, sophisticatedly executed and perfectly cast,
this week's satirical spoof documentary looks at the Big Bad Wolf,
played with leering panache by Leslie Phillips.
Licking his murderous chops with his lecherous tongue, this
interviewee is aghast at the accusations hurtling his way. He expertly
dodges them all -- Wasn't that little pig in his brick house
overreacting rather? The Chief Constable concurs: ''I'm sorry but we
cannot have members of the public taking the law into their own hands
every time a wolf climbs on to their chimney stack. A cauldron of
boiling water is an offence in anyone's language.''
In the Cry Wolf story, the shepherd boy is ignored and eventually
gobbled up after having pointed out a strange-looking sheep with a
bloodied mouth and loping gait. But Wolfie cringes and winces at the
very idea of wearing a sheepskin coat, tasteless as a ticket tout, and
as for Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother, found tied up and locked in
a cupboard, well, the old girl was into bondage, wasn't she?
And it was just as well the police arrived when they did, so that the
nature of their ''adult relationship'' could be explained, and the
clearly deranged axe-wielding father of Red Riding Hood carted off for
questioning. When an undercover policeman seduced our villain into
confessing, the evidence was deemed inadmissable and she got three
months for entrapment. The freed beast subsequently sold his story to
the Sunday Times.
Just as familiar were the rhymes in Radio 2's Tales From the Nursery.
As he explored children's fiction in verse, in this more traditional
format, George Lough gave us another kind of reminder of the adult
connections woven into the fictive worlds we associate with childhood.
(Though the London Plague turns out to have nothing to do with Ring a
Ring a Roses, a fact I found quite heartening in an unimportant kind of
way.)
Iona Opie, a world authority on the history of nursery rhymes,
chatting in her English garden, nicely conveyed her fascination, her
erudite lifelong obsession, with a kind of pleasant pukka charm. I swear
you could smell the Earl Grey . . .
And so to the House of Lords -- also pukka, but charmless, and with a
less than pleasant smell. George Rosie in Radio Scotland's Those Who
Rule Over Us examined our undemocratic, intellectually indefensible
Second Chamber. Peter Clark, a right-wing journalist, opined that it was
the institution's ''very caprice that is its strength''.
Given the pyschological impairment of our elected MPs, he said, the
presence of these ''ordinary human beings'' had a salutary effect, in
that they lead ''reasonably normal lifestyles''. (Ah, the humdrum
existence of the heriditary peer!) More salutary, I think, to remember
that the original meaning of ''caprice'' is ''horror'', not ''whim''.
The old chestnut about the House of Lords being constitutionally
harmless was well squashed as we were reminded that in the '74-'79
period of Labour Government the Lords defeated the Government on average
about 80 times a year. With the Tories in power the figure drops to an
average of between 10 and 12.
Harold Laski, way back in 1936, made more sense than the present-day
apologists who, using banal cricket metaphors, attempt to justify the
unjustifiable with bogus pragmatism (''The question is does it work? The
answer is yes it does''). Laski definitively described the House of
Lords as being ''a body of men, some of whom were careful and some of
whom incredibly careless in the selection of their parents''.

MOST people want a washing machine, require food, and need insurance.
The rules of economics dictate that where a market exists it will be
filled, and commerce and industry work from the premise of a demand that
is often measurable and usually self-evident. The same cannot be said of
the arts. Although much capital is made by arts organisations and
development agencies of the economic benefits of the arts to an area,
the simple equation of supply and demand cannot be applied. No-one needs
to go to the opera, and civilised society is quite possible without
orchestral concerts. Other ways of thinking need to be applied to define
why the arts are crucial to the well-being of a community. Which is why
Sir Lewis Robertson's report into possible collaborations between the
orchestras of Scotland is a disappointment. The give-away is on page
three of the chairman's introduction where he defines the working
group's responsibility to come up with collaborative solutions within
the resources available (his italics). His narrow definition of this has
not restricted itself to financial constraints on the arts that are
already well known, but also the way the organisations operate and the
product they produce. It is an accountant's approach that looks at the
bottom line -- which is #1.25m in the red for music provision in
Scotland according to the report, and that is a conservative estimate --
and looks to where cuts may be made. Restructuring is seen only in terms
of savings in administration costs or the number of people being paid.
The options Sir Lewis outlines are self-evident, and they are listed
only for the purposes of their rejection. The axing of Scottish Opera's
orchestra is such an obvious cost-saver that it hardly justifies the
cost of the report.
To suggest that such a move would solve any of the problems of
orchestral provision in Scotland is quite untrue. Sir Lewis comes up
with an arithmetic solution to provide a band for the opera company for
the number of productions it desires to stage, but only by including the
BBC SSO, which was not part of his original brief. The formula is only
possible because the practicalities of scheduling have only been
addressed at their most basic -- the actual requirements of both
orchestras and opera are not applied. The balancing of each
organisation's programme would be hugely complicated by such a move, and
artistically the lack of a permanent relationship with one group of
musicians would be sure to impair the opera company's high standards. It
is those standards, in our orchestras as well, that are under threat. It
is the taxpayer's money which funds our arts organisations (at least
until such time as the rules governing the National Lottery's largesse
are changed) and the nation's voting public will decide whether it wants
to support a Government which has frozen its contribution to the arts.
It is, however, the nation's ticket-buying public who will decide
whether it wants to support arts organisations that are as frozen in
time in their structures, programme, and presentation as Sir Lewis's
approach would seem to suggest. In part that is unfair: the Perth season
and next year's American festival show that the orchestras are more than
willing to collaborate, but much grander redesign is required than
either the orchestras and opera seem prepared to contemplate or Sir
Lewis, with his obsession with the status quo, seems prepared to
acknowledge. The time has come for radical and imaginative solutions to
a problem that has been evident for years and is deteriorating month by
month. The serious music industry in Scotland must look to its output to
match its case to the Government for more input.

MONTSERRAT Caballe comes on to a concert platform as gravely as the
Principessa in Puccini's Suor Angelica. But she is not always as serious
as she seems. After her grand initial declarations of Greece, and her
expressions of yearning, she is capable of allowing a different, almost
girlish side of her personality to peep through.
This happened as usual last night, though even in the ravishing array
of Spanish songs with which she closed her Glasgow recital she did not
allow us entirely to relax. Maria Rodrigos's Calm is the Night had a
soft sting in its tail, all the more effective for the hovering
sweetness with which it was voiced.
Now that she is 61 -- and she is one of those rare singers who permit
her age to be printed in the programme -- Caballe will doubtless
concentrate increasingly on these songs of her homeland to which she
brings such understanding, and to which her accompanist, Manuel
Burgueras, is so positively attuned.
Yet as the big Rossini arias earlier in the evening demonstrated, she
can still command a remarkable purity of line -- enough, certainly, to
make her continuing recital tours seem more than the last gleams of a
fading star.
By opting for mostly slow music, she was doubtless determined to avoid
unnecessary risks, but her excerpt from Tancredi showed her phrasing to
be still a model of bel canto. In this and in an exquisitely sad
Paisiello aria, she found her way unerringly to the soul of the music,
though it was in a slightly less secure encore, O Mio Babbino Caro, that
she struck her closest rapport with her enthusiastic audience.

IF to subvert is to take the traditional, the well worn and even
cliched quietly to make your point, then Echobelly are real masters of
the art.
For them there is little in the way of gimmicks. Compared with other
contemporary female-fronted British pop bands, they can rely on neither
famous boyfriends nor controversial rantings. Indeed, Echobelly have
earned their position almost in spite of their musical conventionality.
However, closer investigation suggests that they're substantially more
dangerous than the polished veneer of their better-known songs, Great
Things and Insomniac, would suggest.
It says much about British rock's inherent conservatism that an Asian
female singer and a shaven-headed lesbian guitarist stand out so much
from the pack, but it is both the musical and on-stage chemistry between
Sonya Maddan and Debbie Smith that powers the band.
Caught in the conventional two guitars, bass, and drums combination
are insidious melodies: the girlie harmonies on Nobody Like You and the
thoughtful lyrics which touch on issues of childhood intolerance (Call
You Names) and family traditions (Father, Ruler, King, Computer).
Significantly it is the musical reference points -- Maddan's
cap-doffing to the Smiths and Smith's visceral guitar playing which
calls on the Pixies for its inspiration -- rather than the lyrical
concerns which seem to attract an audience which is almost exclusively
white. That, perhaps, is Echobelly's greatest triumph.
Another is their evident strength as songwriters, with new songs such
as King of the Kerb and Go Away displaying a greater depth than anything
on their debut album. The sheer energy of the performance merely adds to
the feeling that their ascent is far from complete.

<FLAG>ANNUAL CONFERENCE</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>976011447</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE time was when every Labour Party conference somehow rebounded to
the party's disadvantage. The face it wanted to present to the country
was warm but argumentative, passionate often but disputatious always yet
fraternal none the less. What the country tended to see, however, was
indiscipline, sometimes intolerance and self-indulgence, if that can
have a collective expression, and an ugly contempt for disagreement
which nearly replaced fraternity with fratricide. Conferences tended to
emphasise divisions within the party and subjected the leadership to a
hard time. Voters must have wondered why they were expected to trust
Labour's leaders when so many party members themselves clearly did not.
The upshot was that Labour's conference too often provided cheap
publicity for the party's enemies.
None of that was true this week. Labour has at last learned
self-discipline. There were voices from the past, it is true, but though
loud they did not persuade: Mr Scargill did not revive the old Clause
Four. If Labour is new in anything it must be in the way the conference
delegates trusted their leaders, and particularly their leader, Mr
Blair, on issues as different as nuclear weaponry and educational
provision. Debates on these matters showed that the conference had not
been emasculated but the outcome was to the party's benefit. It appeared
to be united, whereas it had previously too often appeared to be
divided. Even when there were incidents which might have provoked
internal dissension or presented Tory opportunities, they did not
escalate to the party's disadvantage. A claim that there were secret
deals, after secret meetings, with the unions to re-establish the power
these bodies used to wield, came to nothing without ruffling union
feathers. Another claim that there was no deal with British Telecom to
provide electronic facilities for public educational institutions in
return for licensing privileges, though Mr Blair had announced one, was
soon overturned. There is an ''understanding'' between the company and
party, and it was confirmed by the company as well as by Lord Tebbit. In
short, it proved impossible for Labour's opponents to profit from the
conference as they were once wont.
Mr Blair's own set-piece speech was something of a triumph both in the
hall and outside, where its themes presented problems for the
Conservative press since he had pre-empted much of the ground which was
previously thought to be a Tory preserve. Law and order and concern for
the family are two basic themes where the former Conservative monopoly
has been lost. No doubt it can be claimed that this was all the outcome
of stage management and that legitimate disagreement was simply hushed
up. There would be an element of management, for these conferences, of
all parties, are meant to present an appealing face to the electorate,
but there was more to it all than that. Two forces could be discerned.
First, Labour is hungry for power after four successive electoral
defeats and this hunger has compelled restraint and self-discipline.
Secondly, there is a new feeling abroad within the party, sparked
possibly by the infusion of new blood (new members), and by the
self-confidence of Mr Blair and his colleagues. Restraint and discipline
are not incompatible with ebullience, and this conference had that
combination for the first time in years. It is the Tories meeting in
Blackpool next week who will face new challenges, the Prime Minister who
will be hard pressed to equal his main rival's performance. He will be
lucky if he can project the same image of competence and authority as Mr
Blair managed so skilfully. When last could such a judgment be plausibly
sustained when Labour convened at an English seaside resort?

RARELY can Sean O'Casey have been made to seem so brooding and dark.
Not for director Jon Pope the raucous sparks of O'Casey's wit, instead
the meditative melancholy of his underlying tragedy.
This is the one about Donal Davoren, the new stranger on the block,
assumed by an overly romantic neighbourhood to be a Republican gunman on
the run. Like the mystery man in Synge's Playboy of the Western World,
he unwittingly feeds his community's need for a hero, perhaps the need
to have some sense of taking control. Even the local Orangeman respects
him for his machismo.
But rather than play-up to the comic naivety of this behaviour, Pope
plays it downbeat, marshalling a still, wistful production that, on
Kenny Miller's wide open set, threatens to crack apart at any moment.
Sure, O'Casey's glorious rhythms and cadences are still intact -- with
measured, mature performances from Lalor Roddy (Davoren) and John
O'Toole (his room-mate, Shields) heading a fine cast -- but they are
swathed in a hollow silence that verges on the deadening.
I think it's not helped by Miller's set, which breaks with the
traditional O'Casey naturalism only to confuse the sense of place that
is central to the piece. The towering windows and banks of candles of
the second act may look glorious, but they suggest more a cathedral or a
New York loft than a squalid, over-populated tenement. And they seem to
have little to do with the low-key subtlety of the acting.
Nevertheless, there's a consistency to Pope's vision that brings an
unsettling power of its own; one that, 70 years on, says much about the
tragedies that have followed in O'Casey's wake.

Allan Laing recalls the comic genius of Tommy Cooper, whose unique
buffoonery features this week as part of a retrospective on British
comedy.
AS ONLY Tommy Cooper could say and make you laugh, ''I was cleaning
out the attic the other night with the wife. Filthy, dirty, and covered
with cobwebs . . . but she's good for the kids.'' Or what about this
one: ''I backed a horse at 20 to 1 the other day. It came in at 20 past
4.''
Both lines are clearly jokes, but only when delivered by one man. And
that man didn't even have to tell them to make you laugh. All he had to
do was stand there. In a showbiz world riddled with hyperbole and false
praise, Tommy Cooper truly was a comic genius. A complete one-off.
Some people remember where they were when John Kennedy died. For
others it's John Lennon. With me, it's Tommy Cooper. Because, along with
millions of others one night in April, 1984, I watched his final act. He
collapsed and died on stage during a live television variety show. Down
he went, halfway through his routine. And still we laughed because we
thought it was all part of the performance. Always leave 'em wanting
more, goes the old adage. Cooper did -- just like that. Or was it like
that?
It's nice to think that maybe somewhere in heaven there's a Dead
Comic's Society and that tonight its members -- legends like Arthur
Askey, Max Miller, Joyce Grenfell, Tony Hancock, Frankie Howerd, Les
Dawson, and Eric Morecambe -- will be creasing themselves as Cooper, the
only angel with a fez, does his glass-bottle, bottle-glass routine. And
perhaps there'll be another comic laughing up there too. The late Chic
Murray is probably the only one who, in his generation, came close to
touching Tommy Cooper's style and humour.
It is only fitting that a new six-part Channel Four series, Heroes of
Comedy, should start with a special 90-minute tribute to Cooper. More
than a year of painstaking research has unearthed some rare television
clips. The programme also features affectionate recollections (and
wonderful anecdotes) from his old chums, including Spike Milligan, Bob
Monkhouse, Eric Sykes, Johnny Speight, and Jimmy Tarbuck.
And then there is Sir Anthony Hopkins to whom, curiously, Cooper is a
towering hero. The great actor even delivers a pretty fair Tommy Cooper
impersonation and reveals that, when making a film, he always tries to
break the tension between takes by telling Cooper's gags.
He says: ''Everything about the human condition is so laughable and
that's where he touched the funny-bone in me and made me laugh so much.
He was such an anarchist and such a fool. The seriousness of actors has
always left me cold but people like Eric Morecombe, Tommy Cooper, and
Ken Dodd have always got to me because they laugh at themselves, they
laugh at us. I think what he did was make us laugh at the fool in
ourselves. He was the greatest of them all.''
It is not only pointless but also impossible to analyse comedy. You
shouldn't do it. Once you start trying to work out why something is
funny then, well, then it's no longer funny. Mind you, Spike Milligan
hits the nail on the head. Cooper, he says, was that rarest of comedians
-- a true droll. A wonderful idiot.
''First of all they must look funny. The moment he would come on I
would crease up. Don't ask me why. There was this face, a face crying
for help, and this huge body. He could do anything after that to me. He
was more than funny, he was miraculous,'' Milligan recalls.
Bob Monkhouse describes him as the kind of comic who told jokes you'd
buy from a joke shop. And yet he made them funny. Even when he was not
performing, he was still performing. When he was paying a taxi fare, for
instance, he'd slip a pound note into the driver's jacket pocket and
say, ''Have a drink on me''. Only it wasn't a pound note, it was a
teabag.
As a magician (he could spend as much as #1000 a week on props for his
tricks) he was a glorious failure. But, of course, he wasn't. He was a
highly skilled conjurer. His spectacular incompetence was a carefully
choreographed ruse. It was his wonderful way of poking gentle fun at his
art form.
''He had a different way of looking at magic,'' says Paul Daniels.
''By poking fun at it. He always tried to do it and succeeded to make
audiences aware that magic can be enjoyed -- and therefore he elevated
it.''
Daniels also recalls an occasion, during a Water Rats Ball, when
Cooper was called upon to make an after-dinner speech. ''He stood up,
that's all he did. He just stood up and the place was in absolute
hysterics . . . at a man standing up. That ability to fill a room with
laughter. Now, I don't care how much you study comedy, you can't define
that.''
Jimmy Tarbuck, a lifelong friend, tells a wonderful story about Cooper
during a Royal Variety performance. After the show, they were all lined
up for the customary meeting with the Queen. When she reached Cooper she
said: ''You were wonderful tonight, Tommy. So funny.'' He said: ''Did
you laugh?'' to which she replied: ''Yes. We all laughed.''
''Was I funny?'' he persisted. ''Yes, terribly funny!'' declared Her
Majesty. ''So you laughed then?'' he asked. ''Yes, yes,'' she replied.
Then Cooper said: ''Good. Then can I ask you something personal?''
Tarbuck recalls that you could have heard a pin drop. Everyone steeled
themselves. Had he gone too far?
''Do you like football?'' he inquired. ''Not particularly,'' replied
the Queen. ''Good,'' he said. ''Then can I have your tickets for the Cup
Final?'' At which point the entire place fell about laughing. Now
there's bottle for you.
The Heroes of Comedy series, which has been made by Thames Television
for Channel 4, is written and produced by John Fisher. Other legends
featured in forthcoming shows are Joyce Grenfell, Max Miller, Arthur
Haynes, Frankie Howerd, and Terry Thomas. Of these, probably Haynes is
the most neglected. Mention his name to anyone under 40 and you will be
met with a blank stare. And yet, in the mid-sixties, he was Britain's
highest-paid television star.
* Heroes of Comedy -- Tommy Cooper will be shown on Channel 4 next
Friday night.

ALMOST from the day of their appointment last July the question was
posed: which of them is going to run the next General Election campaign?
We are talking about Michael Heseltine, Deputy Prime Minister, and Brian
Stanley Mawhinney, party chairman.
Some take the view that the tall, dashing Heseltine will dominate Tory
HQ in Smith Square, swamping Mawhinney with his style and presence. They
see Mawhinney relegated to the role of staff officer, important, but not
the figurehead.
John Prescott spotted this yesterday in his Labour conference speech.
''The other Party Chairman'' was his label for Heseltine. There will be
more of that to come, particularly in the heat of an election campaign.
But this is a very tough Ulsterman, well equipped to make his presence
felt. Nobody stands on his toes for long without feeling retaliation. If
John Major can win again, Mawhinney wants to be the one recognised for
having delivered him the victory.
Perhaps the juxtaposition of the two men, both pro politicians, will
produce the frisson and personality edge that will generate a victory
against the odds. There was a glimpse of how it might be at last month's
Chequers Cabinet meeting which turned out to be a bit of a
presentational flop.
Together at a press conference table in a nearby pub, Mawhinney sat
silent and bleak-faced as Heseltine fielded the questions, largely about
a document leaked from the office of Education Secretary Gillian
Shephard. One sensed that this was an unintentional dry run of what it
might be like every day during a three-week election campaign. If so,
Mawhinney will have learned from the experience.
Lesson one: it is best not to have press conferences when you have
nothing to say.
Dr Mawhinney, 55, is a careful, thoughtful man, devoted to John Major,
whose leadership re-election campaign he helped to run. They came into
Parliament together in May 1979 and have neighbouring constituencies.
His wife Betty gets on well with Norma Major. In the early days, when
they had the leisure, they dined out together constantly.
They are temperamentally atuned, which is as it should be in a
leader/chairman relationship; both capable of cunning and scheming, both
stubborn. Mawhinney has the shorter fuse and the sharper tongue. Alcohol
scarcely passes his lips (a glass or two of wine over lunch). He abhors
smoking, but tolerates it in others in my experience. He and his wife
are devout Christians. He is labelled a Lucozade lover, though I have
never seen him drink it once in 16 years.
His route to high office has been steady and conventional. Margaret
Thatcher gave him his start by appointing him parliamentary aide to the
affable Barney Hayhoe (now Lord Hayhoe) when he was minister of state at
the Treasury. He did this for two years and then transferred for another
two years of unpaid bag-carrying to Tom King when he was Northern
Ireland Secretary.
In this role he proved exceedingly adept. Many were the trips he made
to Dublin, quietly, almost secretly. There his native understanding of
the Irish and the Irish problem was invaluable. He was both a sounding
board for UK-Irish relations and he is credited with behind-the-scenes
work on the UK-Irish Agreement signed by a somewhat reluctant Thatcher.
In 1986, he was brought into government in the Northern Ireland office
where he spent six years, rising to minister of state, and was supremely
happy administering his own country. He was the first Ulsterman to be
appointed there since direct rule.
He was the first, under Peter Brooke, to get politicians of all
parties sitting round a table for 16 years.
His father, a restaurateur (the Lilac Room), saw to it that he had a
top-grade education. From the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, he
progressed to Queen's University where he took a doctorate in radiation
biology.
For two years he was assistant professor in radiation research at the
University of Iowa. And so his medical career might have progressed had
he not read Theodore White's Making of the President. This intimate and
detailed account of John F. Kennedy's campaign for the presidency fired
his interest in politics. Back in England, he stood unsuccessfully in a
Labour stronghold before getting Peterborough, now adjusted in boundary
changes and marginally safer.
From Northern Ireland, he went to Health where many believe he
underpinned Virginia Bottomley, drawing at least some of the fire of her
controversial period there. Whitehall civil servants put it about that
he, although only No 2, was running the department. When she dithered,
he acted.
A classic example of this came when a Health Education Authority sex
guide -- sponsored, embarrassingly, by the Department -- which proved to
be all too graphic was due for circulation. Dr Mawhinney, one-time
member of the General Synod, suppressed it as ''smutty''. On another
occasion, he preferred Cliff Richard to Elton John to front a publicty
campaign. He is said to have stiffened Bottomley's resolve in the
highly-controversial reorganisation of London hospitals. More often than
not, it was Mawhinney who took to the airwaves to counter an avalanche
of criticism.
Major gave him his first Cabinet job at Transport last year. Expecting
a political bruiser with entrenched views, the Civil Service found him
to be, if anything, conciliatory. The pressure groups were called in to
put their case and, in most instances, found him charming. Controversial
road projects were cancelled in sensitive areas. He was determined to
produce a sensible road-rail policy, pragmatic and environmentally
sound. The issue of charging motorists for road use was put back on the
agenda.
He is said to have trod on Civil Service toes in the various
departments. Some found him rude, thuggish even at times. But the
permanent secretaries, the mandarins with whom he has served, respect
his academic analytical brain. He established a basic rule: ''I have to
carry the can, so I want to know what is going on.'' Those who broke
this rule received the full impact of his harsh Ulster tone. They may
have been relieved when he left one department for another, but he is
respected.
At Westminster, he has not been noted as a spellbinding orator; rather
a fastidious and courteous persuader. His mode of operation, a quiet
chat in the corridor; hours in the Commons tea rooms talking to MPs on
all sides. In one-to-one contacts, his voice is much softer than it
sounds in his broadcasts. There is usually an Irish twinkle in his eye.
It is assumed that when Major sprang the leadership contest on his
party in July, one of the very few who was not surprised was Dr
Mawhinney. He agreed with Sir Patrick Mayhew, his fellow Irishman, that
it was essential to make a challenge that would end the carping. His
methodical nature was a valuable asset to the Major campaign and those
on the team were destined to become the Prime Minister's closest
confidants.
Now Dr Mawhinney has the biggest job of his 25 years as a member of
the Tory Party. He has set about it with vigour over the summer,
travelling the country highlighting inefficient Labour local
authorities. This technique is coupled with a scatter-gun effect. He and
Heseltine have been vying with each other to ridicule New Labour and
defend the Government against the allegations of exhaustion.
Next week in Blackpool he has a key speech to make, perhaps the
biggest of his career. If he can transform himself from the quiet man of
British politics into an inspirational figure, capable of deploying
powerful invective, the ''other Party Chairman'' may not be needed after
all.

John Linklater finds that for once he agrees with Amstrad chairman
Alan Sugar as he dishes it out to satellite TV
ALWAYS a kind word. When someone as equitably-challenged as Alan Sugar
says that satellite TV is ''garbage'' maybe it is time for a
revaluation. Those of us who have never quite understood the compulsion
to hang a big white dish outside the window to broadcast your state of
terminal feeble-mindedness, have possibly got it wrong after all.
These dishes antagonise the residents' committees in places like
Hyndland, where they enjoy the status of the leper's bell or the black
cross daubed on the door of a plague victim.
The provocation is largely of Sugar's instigation. Amstrad, the
computer and consumer electronics company he runs when he is not sacking
managers, paying fines for financial irregularities or, as chairman of
Tottenham Hotspur, telling German internationalists who won the war,
supplied the first wave of dishes in stupefying quantities across the
nation. Now he can't flog any more dishes, Sugar has revealed that
they're not worth having.
Sour grapes? When the going was good for Amstrad with tie-in deals
underwritten by Sky to get the hardware into homes and kick-start the
market, the quality of the product was there to be seen. Alan Sugar
never said ''garbage'' then. Amstrad shifted an estimated 1.5 million
receivers on the back of Sky promotions, and at least 3.5 million in
Germany, but they have been replaced in the latest deals by the
Leeds-based company Pace, along with Grundig and Matsui.
Consumers get subsidised dishes and receivers if they sign up a full
Sky subscription. It is like mobile phones, the area Amstrad continually
say they will diversify into. The subscription is more than the cut-rate
equipment. For satellite TV the deal is under #100, but Sky
subscriptions are going up to #25 a month from November 1, after a
smattering of new channels have been added. Observers are dubious.
The Disney Channel might look like piling some more cartoons into the
existing Sky Movies Gold, the Sci-Fi Channel is only a few hours a week,
Sky Sports Gold is an excuse to re-run endless repeats of England
winning the World Cup and Our 'Enery Cooper re-spilling his gore in
monochrome. The Paramount Channel is another place to dump I Love Lucy
repeats of the repeats and EBN picks up the existing European Business
News for Sky kudos. The Playboy Channel is another #6 a month on top of
the full subscription. Which leaves The History Channel as the only
offering which looks even vaguely new.
All of this gave Sugar the chance to misquote Bruce Springsteen.
Springsteen's song alleged there were 57 channels, and nothing on. Sugar
said Amstrad would not be developing the new generation of digital
receivers, a more expensive product that would retail for #600, because
''you can watch 48 channels of garbage for #99''.
''He was not referring directly to Sky TV,'' their press office
suggested disingenuously yesterday, suddenly modest about a stanglehold
of more than 90% of satellite TV in Britain.
This sour grapes may not be exclusive to Alan Sugar, but who seriously
wants Sky Sports at home when the excellent coverage of Scottish and
English games provides grand excuses for spending Sundays and most
nights in the early part of the week in the nearest pub. The BBC's boast
yesterday to have signed a multi-million five-year deal with DreamWorks
to screen all the new Steven Spielbergs is only a terrestrial exclusive,
since Sky Movies and The Movie Channel will get in first, as they always
do. Unless you happen to be capable of visiting a cinema.
''No, I don't think satellite TV is garbage,'' says Geoff Bains,
editor of What Satellite TV. ''I don't watch that much television, but I
like the range of choice on satellite. You're not watching just because
it's on. The films are good, the sport is excellent. The Simpsons
cartoon is a cult. And all of it is taken by the BBC about 18 months
later. You can try to argue that all television is garbage and make a
case. But satellite is what an awful lot of people want to watch.''
The figure is estimated at four million, though it has taken the past
18 months to add the final quarter in a slowing demand. New subscribers
have reduced to not much more than 10,000 a month. It is a difficult
call to make. If they are all wrong, we have to address the possibility
that Alan Sugar has actually been right on an issue. Either way, he'd
prefer to sell them a mobile phone.

THE name, as yet, may be hard to remember, but the playing sticks in
the mind. On a visit to Glasgow yesterday, Aberdeen's young Swedish-born
quartet-in-residence brilliantly juxaposed modern music with Beethoven,
leaving no doubt about its grasp of different idioms and its ability to
find common ground between them.
So, David Horne's Undulations, far from seeming a token Scottish
introduction to the Beethoven quartet that formed the bulk of this
lunchtime concert, could be perceived instead as music possessing some
of the same terseness and abruptness, and some of the same way of
mingling attack with meditation.
Though written for these players only a few months ago, it was
presented with an assurance that made its structure absolutely firm and
its message -- conveyed through a series of instrumental comments upon,
decorations of, and attempts to interrupt a softly musing cello line --
strikingly explicit.
As for the more familiar territory of Beethoven's E minor quartet, Op
59, No 2, it was mapped afresh, with wonderfully lucid inner detail, and
a keen command of the music's surge and swirl, of its robustness, and
(in an unhurriedly unfurled adagio) melancholy sweetness.

THE daughter of Steventon Rectory was more cunning than television
allows. The Rev Austen's youngest, writing in the last, golden bloom of
eighteenth-century prose, quietly pulled off a trick that was, in its
day, quite as much a technical novelty as anything the screenwriters
have since managed with flashes back, forward, and sideways.
It doesn't sound like much, but by dispensing with what clever folk
call a participating narrator, Jane Austen left Andrew Davies, her
twentieth-century writing partner, with a sizable problem. What is the
camera, after all, if not a participating, and pitiless, narrator?
Austen, cool observer and subtle commentator, managed to catch both the
internal and external qualities of her characters: TV can't do that.
Then again, it takes a lot to daunt Mr Davies, who approaches
adaptation the way Tamburlaine approached diplomacy. But it is worth
asking, as enthusiasm for another lovingly crafted BBC costume drama
grips the country, is Pride and Prejudice (BBC1, Sunday) ''really'' Jane
Austen? And if not, does it truly matter? No and No.
Austen has defeated all previous attempts to capture her sly humour
and lepidopterist's eye for emotional butterflies, and Davies, good
writer that he is, has not solved the problems here. Equally, such is
the grip of Dickens on period drama that too many actors, and there are
several here, tend to tumble headlong into the gulf between
characterisation and caricature when long frocks and funny hats are
around.
But what of it? This account of the truth, universally acknowledged,
that single men in possession of good fortunes invariably seek spouses,
the louses, may not be purest Austen but it is, for the most part,
rollicking good fun. We may be distracted too often from Elizabeth
Bennet herself, and we may miss the flavour of what is, intensely and
above all, a story written by a woman, but we are given human complexity
in a way that most TV drama wouldn't begin to grasp. The book was
originally called First Impressions.
That said, we shall be back for more.
Mercifully, we won't have to return to the Labour Party conference for
another year. After all, how do you review such a thing? As drama?
Sport? As some sort of ideological equivalent of the Eurovision Song
Contest (''And now the NEC Singers with Boom Bang-a Composite Motion'')?
At the end, the only thought to pass muster was that you must never
review proceedings as the party managers would have you review them.
Thus, it was incumbent upon the critic to waste no time wondering
whether there was significance in the fact that at this year's Labour
gathering (Conference Live 95, daily) the set was a reassuring offal
pink rather than controversial slime green. Equally, it was of vital
importance to ignore anything the BBC's commentators were saying, and on
no account to become immersed in the diverting question of just why the
corporation needs quite so many reporters at the seaside.
No: only the performances matter, and at this year's Labour
conference, an entertainment managed with the precision of a show-trial
or a Lottery draw, only the Leader's speech, otherwise the Sermon on the
Prom, was of any consequence.
At close to an hour in length, this was a brave turn. Labour learned
the hard way when Michael Foot was leader that old-style socialist
perorations, clause building on clause like waves advancing on a beach,
lines of thought stretched and moulded like so much putty, are as
relevant to the TV age as Marxism is to Marks and Spencer. Foot lived by
the breadth of his vocabulary and died, as a politician, because of TV's
lack of it.
But Mr Blair, a clever man, did a clever thing. Like a child with
wooden bricks he built his speech from little pieces, nibbles of sound,
thunderous exclamatory verbless sentences, one piled on the other, a
stream of sublime unconsciousness. In print it made little grammatical
sense; on screen it looked and sounded like Sunday morning at the Holy
Rolling Church of Labour Risen. Needless to say, none of this has much
to do with politics: that is the entire point.
Then again, reality itself is rarely reliable. Last week we should
have warned you that the best piece of TV drama in many a long month was
about to appear, but since post-mortems rather than predictions are this
column's duty, we can now only remind you that David Kane's Ruffian
Hearts (BBC2, Saturday), third and last of the Love Bites trilogy, was
simply superb, and instruct you to catch the re-run.
Kane, writer and director, has been threatening something like this
for a while. Jute City was a brave experiment; Dreambaby almost made it;
Finney (shown last year on ITV) left you in hope that, just once,
promise was about to be fulfilled. Ruffian Hearts, a film that in any
sane country would have enjoyed proper cinema release, hit all the
notes.
Praise is always more difficult than blame, but this piece, from cast
to music to Barry McCann's ever-watchful camera (yes, you can actually
compose a shot for the small screen) was near impossible to fault. It
was funny, it was cruel, it was desolate and affecting, composed the way
Escher would compose a drawing, constructed the way chamber music is
constructed, memorable the way a good pop tune is memorable.
Do I make myself clear? This was also, in large facts and small
details, in every respect a Scottish piece. When the Glasgow skyline
appears on screen these days this reviewer tends to expect the worst,
but the city here, grubbily mundane and weird by turns, became something
magical. And all the cast -- Maureen Beattie, Clive Russell, Vicki
Masson, Ewen Bremner, Bronagh Gallagher, Paul Blair, Jenny McCrindle and
Peter Mullan -- deserve every prize they are going to get. Kane,
meanwhile, is going to be huge.
Once upon a time all European cinema was huge. Once upon a time we
instructed Hollywood in cinema grammar. Cinema Europe -- The Other
Hollywood (BBC2, Sunday) was a touching reminder of how simple film is
once you strip away the fripperies of sound, colour, special effects and
twenty-million-dollar salaries. The visual language is essentially
uncomplicated yet universal; that's the magic of it.
In these ancient reels from cinema's first days, when LA was a few
orange groves at the end of a railroad track, there survived the
once-mighty cinema of Denmark, the huge historical epics of Italy, the
distinctive domesticity of Britain, the theatrical art of Germany, and
the panache of France. As the piece unfolded you asked yourself how it
all came to be so easily destroyed by a Californian industry that still
thinks art is for galleries and messages for Western Union. Wonderful
stuff, nevertheless.

As the press magnates cuddle up to the Labour Party, Margaret Vaughan
reports that the spurned Tories, frankly, do give a damn
Dear Mystic Maggie,
I fear I'm about to be jilted, and not for the first time. After years
of unbroken mutual admiration, a relationship I thought was permanent,
founded on trust and unquestioning loyalty, is under threat. Only
yesterday I caught him giving the come-on, flirting with my arch-rival,
a bright young thing with googly eyes. What's more, to my shame, he did
it in public, writing a teasing billet-doux in The Spectator. Now, you
may say it's only a passing phase. But I fear the worst, I really do.
You see, only a few weeks ago I was devastated when a man I'd always
believed was my closest friend in the whole wide world of media
conglomerates, did the very same thing and threatened to dump me. He too
seems to want to get into bed with this new kid on the block. I just
don't know which way to turn.
Yours, sobbing into the pillow,
Sad John
Dear John,
No, no, this is not one of those letters -- yet. Yes, dear, you do
have problems, and far be it from me to judge but, as my old friend Mrs
Bracknell used to say, to lose one suitor may be regarded as a
misfortune, to lose both looks like carelessness.
But fear not. These men, by the sounds of it, are mere flirts who, as
we both know, are notoriously fickle. They may be toying with your
affections, testing your loyalty, making you pay for failing to give
them your undivided attentions, stoking their egos and dancing to their
tunes.
They may stray. But they will return. As rats desert a sinking ship,
so media magnates with big circulations to care for may -- temporarily
-- be drawn to the new Mr Right, or should that be Mr Left, of politics.
So chin up, chuck; stop snivelling. And if you'll take a bit of advice
from the stars, you'll just enjoy the party conference. While you can.
Mystic Maggie
FOR the audience at Blackpool it might be viewed as the biggest
betrayal since sulky Rhett Butler stalked out of Tara, the most
heart-rending ending since the final scene of Brief Encounter. Not since
Rick took off into the clouds above Casablanca has a love affair looked
set for such an unhappy ending.
Is this it then? Is Sir David English really planning to play out the
final act in the long courtship of Associated Newspapers and the
Conservative Party? Has the ardour of the UK's biggest Tory-supporting
newspaper group really cooled? Or is it all a bit of fantasy, wooing a
rival in revenge for a wounded ego?
Is his cuddling up to Tony Blair just a ploy to whip the Tory Party
into line, a timely reminder ahead of conference that loyal suitors
should not, cannot be taken for granted? The script might hold a few
clues to the ending.
Sir David's teasing intervention provoked amusement, scepticism and
some disbelief in Labour ranks. Nobody seriously thought there was the
remotest chance that the virulently anti-Labour papers would undergo a
profound conversion, of road-to-Damascus proportions, which would lead
them to line up behind Labour at the election.
Rather Sir David's musings were seen, in part at least, as providing
some welcome discomfort for Conservatives who gather in Blackpool next
week. The revenge motive should not be underestimated.
It will seem all the more disconcerting for the Conservatives, coming,
as it does, after Rupert Murdoch's recent wooing of Tony Blair.
During the past 15 years, Labour has had no adversaries more rabid
than Rupert Murdoch and Sir David English.
Then, earlier this year, Murdoch confessed to a German magazine that
he ''could even imagine supporting the British Labour leader, Tony
Blair.''
Criticism of Tony Blair's alleged ''cuddling up'' with Murdoch meets a
straightforward answer. It is that any party leader must covet the
support of someone whose papers sell more than five million copies a
day.
For Murdoch's part, any entrepreneur with interests in the
highly-regulated media industry is only being prudent in wooing a
potential Prime Minister who could have the power to ease or toughen the
regulations.
So what then are we to make of the two largest, and arguably most
influential, newspaper groups in the country apparently switching
political allegiances?
It may be that political allegiances are being dictated not by
ideology, or by enchantment with the charming Mr Blair, but by
commercial interests.
Newspapers know that their editorial line cannot be too far adrift
from what their readers think. If the readers want change, or are moving
to the centre or left, it is a brave newspaper that will head off in the
opposite direction.
Evidence for this comes from Australia and the switherings of
Murdoch's papers there. These have usually supported politicians in
power or likely to attain it.
By switching sides strategically Murdoch has been allowed at various
times to own larger slices of the newspaper and television industries
than the rules appeared to permit.
By making approaches to Tony Blair, Murdoch is acting true to form.
Even if he doesn't believe Labour will win the election, the courtship
acts as a useful signal to John Major's Government that his support
can't be taken for granted.
Senior figures in the party also believe, and the Tories know, that
elections are won or lost two years before election day. Unless the
groundwork is done then, no amount of clever campaigning can shift
perceptions except around the margins.
Even to be spared the vicious treatment meted out to Kinnock and
before him Michael Foot would be a bonus, in Labour eyes.
What seems to be happening is that while the Tory press remains
grudging about Blair, its readers quite like him.
All the old certainties have vanished. The Tory Party is split over
Europe and over economic policy. Its leadership looks weak. The Labour
Party is seen to have united around a new leader and an amended
constitution, gaining thousands of new members and supporters.
Many of those converts to New Labour are the very middle classes who
form the bulk of the readership of Tory-supporting newspapers.
So what is a notoriously partisan press supposed to do in these
circumstances? To understand the predicament of Sir David English and
Rupert Murdoch we have to look back. For this is not a simple story of
the rise of a charismatic Labour leader.
It is, in essence, a consequence of the long-term onslaught on the
party, and its short-run but vehement disenchantment with the
post-Thatcher Tories.
From the mid-seventies, the rightwing newspaper attacks on Labour were
unrelenting. Meanwhile, the visionary free marketeer, Margaret Thatcher,
was extolled.
But this was not done in a vacuum. Newspaper editors were triumphant
because they realised they were reflecting the prevailing mood of the
nation and influencing it.
After the downfall of Thatcher, her chosen successor never caught the
imagination of the press or public in the same way. Within months
simmering disenchantment with Major exploded into print in both the Mail
and the Sun, culminating in failed attempts to persuade Tory MPs to dump
him for Redwood.
Major was cast as a hapless incompetent. Blair, meanwhile, was elected
Labour leader. He was turning Labour into a consensual
middle-of-the-road party from which the electorate had nothing to fear.
Proof of the public switch in allegiance came with publication of a Mori
poll which showed that the largest drop in Tory support since the last
election had occurred among readers of Tory papers.
More than 20% of Telegraph and Times readers had turned against the
Tories. Of the Mail's readers, 37% said they would vote for New Labour.
Obviously it is risky for the paper to appear too strident in its
continuing crusade against Labour.
All of which says something deeper still about relationships between
newspapers and readers. It punctures one pervasive myth about the press,
that it can simply force its readers through electoral hoops by leading
them by the nose.
The process of the press's influence is infinitely more complex,
although it is undeniable that relentlessly hostile newspaper coverage
does help to create the mind-set of its readers over time.
Perhaps Sir David English, among others, is learning the lesson.  If a
paper preaches the wrong political sermon to its readers they don't like
it. Still, as we all know, sequels have been written to mend even the
saddest of broken love affairs. As Scarlett so drily observed, tomorrow
is another day.

More Scots are calling for cosmetic surgery: Beverley Lyons describes
how they are shaping up.
WHEN Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein in 1816, she would have little
predicted that a whole nation of her successors would pay homage to her
monster as the prototype for remoulding their looks.
Reports of magical man-made creations constantly hit the headlines as
innovative discoveries are made in the world of cosmetic surgery and the
sell-out in a recent gathering of latter-day Dr Frankensteins at ScotFit
95, the first Scottish fitness fair to combine aerobic instruction with
cosmetic classes, confirmed the belief that we Scots are taking more and
more care of our torsos au naturale and not-so-natural ways.
Aesthetics, like some other aspects of hyper-reality vis-a-vis our
lives, is big business in the nineties and like the monstrous creation,
cosmetic surgery and its clients' numbers have grown in stature to
towering proportions in the past 20 years.
While the late eighties highlighted a spurt in the numbers flocking to
have a nose, boob or face job, the nineties has marked a growth in the
amount of alternative treatments available.
These days, in a similar fashion to old Frankie's romantic hero,
popularly depicted with bolts in his tightened neck, one of the latest
treatments of endioscopic (keyhole) surgery for clients involves the
placing of a screw in the crown of one's head -- therein, the bolt is
tightened to pull up the flesh and firm the face.
Using another treatment Dr Frankenstein would be proud of, electrical
impulses are passed through the facial tissue in a non-invasive
technique. Medically approved in repairing residual Bell's palsy and
aiding arthritic sufferers, it now features in the beauty industry
joining soya bean implants, initially utilised in intravenous feeding.
With less worthy, yet still firm foundations, lips can today be formed
using goretex -- otherwise known as knicker elastic. Professionals in
the beauty industry put these current excesses in choice of treatments
down to society's shift in perception regarding the 40-something
generation and their super-prolonged shelf life. A new baby-boomer race
is apparently responsible for pushing through the glass ceiling of old
age and negative attitudes that cling to it.
Others suggest the increased Scottish interest owes itself to our
ameliorated weather conditions and a newfound self-consciousness in the
sun, our bodies being previously hidden in the heavy Highland mists.
Jackie Sullivan, managing director of London-based Surgical Advisory
Service, has witnessed an increase in the amount of patients seeking
advice on cosmetic surgery in the West of Scotland.
She explains: ''South of the country, the recession is still limiting
growth but Glaswegians appear to be going against the trend. Glasgow
shows signs of being a buoyant area where there is quite a lot of
glamour, and sophistication coupled with a great deal of disposable
income among 30 and 40-somethings.''
Supporting Sullivan's statement, Michael Mann, aerobics and fitness
co-ordinator of Renfrew District Council and director of the ScotFit
event last weekend cites statistics from a survey carried out in the
border regions of Glasgow and Edinburgh, which show that: ''By the year
2000 the beauty industry will overtake exercise industries as the
highest growing sector of the local leisure market.''
He adds: ''Some clients want to reach the ultimate pinnacle of beauty,
so combine gym classes and massage with cosmetic surgery. A lot of women
who are lazy look for a magic cream alternative. They like to be
pampered and made to feel good and ultimately are prepared to pay large
sums of money to do so.''
Corresponding to the demographics of an ageing population, figures
show a spiral upwards in beauty interests for the over-thirties who,
evidently, will continuously try to hold back the years. Mann claims:
''In Glasgow by the year 2000, there will be less exercise users in the
18-30 market while 30 to 60-year-old users will increase by 50%.''
The contemporary cosmetic rush among baby boomers is, according to
Pauline Logue, a cosmetic beauty consultant with Glasgow's Caci clinic,
indicative of the hi-tech society we live in.
She says: ''We are in a computer age where people can sit you down and
remould your face in a flash.'' The demands made by our modern ageing
population seem to necessitate a better quality of life among the
over-forties, especially working women.
''Our careers, unlike those of our parents, are just taking off at 40
but a woman with two kids will not be looking as good as her 40-year-old
male counterparts. Anything that gives women confidence can be used.''
Although it is certain that aesthetic surgery is an accepted part of
life for Stateside Kens and Barbies, Logue and her colleagues believe
the British media has been reticent in accepting the cosmetics culture.
Timothy Milward, vice-president of British Association of Plastic
Surgeons, suggests the recent marked rise in media curiosity
hasincreased interest among Scots consumers.
He says: ''Scotland had a very puritanical view of surgery in previous
years but perhaps has felt some form of mental release through magazines
and film stars, talking about it. The taboo label is now defunct.''
While adopting the accepted view that surgery can be good for the
self-esteem, Milward disagrees with Logue's theory that working women
require an extra confidence boost in looking as good as they feel and
asserts: ''Women in work have better self confidence and satisfaction
than someone who is out of a job.''
He does, however, feel that: ''Women are expected to be beautiful and
men are allowed to be ugly in today's society.'' Which might explain why
80% of all cosmetic surgery is carried out on females, but it still
doesn't account for the exceptional growing interest in cosmetics among
the Scottish.
Milward proposes his own answer: ''Previously people could hide their
breasts and saggy tummies in Scottish Highlands in mist. With the good
weather you've been having they don't stand a chance.''
Mary Shelley would be turning in her grave.

DEEDEE CUDDIHY looks at the hype surrounding Aloe Vera refreshments.
IN THE beginning there was Cod Liver Oil, then Royal Jelly followed by
Evening Primrose Oil, and Korean Ginseng. Now Aloe Vera, a fairly
common, cactus-looking plant with fleshy leaves is being hailed as the
latest cure-all ''miracle'' product to hit the natural remedies world.
Alexander the Great is said to have found it very useful in the
treatment of war wounds. Black's medical dictionary describes Aloe Vera
as a purgative which, if taken in the evening, ''acts next morning''. It
has also been found to be effective in the treatment of burns and
frostbite. More recently, Aloe Vera has found its way into everything
from shampoo to deodorants.
But its marketing as a so-called detoxifying, preventative and general
health-giving drink is what has caused Aloe Vera sales to really take
off.
Companies specialising in these drinks are not allowed to claim, due
to a lack of scientific studies to back them up, that they can prevent,
treat or cure disease. But there are, apparently, customers willing to
testify to the efficacy of Aloe Vera juice as an aid to the alleviation
of such conditions as ME, irritable bowel syndrom, fatigue and general
not-wellness.
The biggest player in the Aloe Vera field is Forever Living Products,
an American company whose goods have only been on sale in Scotland since
July.
What's different about Forever Living is that their merchandise is
available, not through shops but through multi-level marketing.
To get started, rookie distributors who must first demonstrate their
commitment to the company by purchasing just under #300-worth of their
goods, are advised to contact 20 friends, relatives and acquaintances
and persuade them to either buy the merchandise or sell it themselves.
It is claimed #2000 per month can be made in sales commissions.
The problem facing Forever Living distributors these days, however, is
that other similarly priced Aloe Vera drinks and products are now being
sold through retail outlets.
So why buy from a Forever Living distributor who may take time to get
your goods to you, if you can shop at your local health store right
away?
I spoke to four enthusiastic distributors this week, all of whom
stated that what put Forever Living way ahead of its competitors was
that theirs was the only Aloe Vera gel on the market which was
stabilised, a process that locks in the freshness of the product and
ensures its ''potency'' over a long period of time.
''Nobody else can stabilise their Aloe Vera gel,'' they told me,
''because Forever Living holds the patent.''
Which was news to Aloe Vera Limited of Crowborough in East Sussex, a
company that has been marketing its own stabilised Aloe Vera drink for
the past seven years.
A spokesman said: ''Most of the world's commercially produced Aloe
Vera is grown in the western part of the United States where the gel is
stabilised through a cold processing method within a few hours of being
harvested and then shipped to companies like ours for use in drinks and
other goods.''
Feeling a little confused, I rang Forever Living's English base in
Warwick and a spokeswoman there told me: ''Other companies may stabilise
their gel but they can't use the special, patented process that we
use.''
When I relayed this information to one of the Scottish distributors I
had spoken to earlier, she said: ''I feel terrible now. I've been so
excited about this because I thought I was selling a unique product. Are
you sure you've got your facts right?''

ANNE COWAN looks at the global appeal of Irish fashion designer Jimmy
Hourihan.
AT HOME in Dublin, or away in Scotland, Japan or the United States,
fine fabrics and easy elegance are the hallmarks of Jimmy Hourihan's
clothes. Now 62, this Irish designer has a devoted following. Because
his jackets, coats and capes suit such a range of ages and sizes and can
be worn equally well in city or country, it is impossible to define the
Hourihan customer.
Fashion runs in the family. Hourihan's mother had a clothing store,
Colette Modes in Georges Street, Dublin. After taking a business degree
at UCD, he trained as a designer with Jack Clarke. He later set up on
his own designing and manufacturing. In 1960 Jimmy Hourihan set sail,
literally, to test the American market. The man who helped him to unload
his boxes of wares from the ship asked where he was headed. The answer
was Chicago and San Francisco. The porter then told him that he'd never
sell them there. It would be better to try right here in New York city.
This proved to be good advice. After an unsuccessful coast-to-coast
trip, Hourihan's first port of call back in New York was Saks, where an
order for 1600 items was placed. The north-east of the States and
particularly New England, remain an important market. However, nowadays
in San Francisco, Chicago, and elsewhere Saks, Bergdorf, Maceys and
smaller specialty stores stock Jimmy Hourihan. Because the lines are
warm but light and stylish outer wear, climate dictates where they are
worn. Japan and the UK are obvious markets.
Jimmy's son, Colman, is also in the business. ''We work only in
precious fabric blends, such as cashmere, angora and alpaca,'' he says.
''Our strength lies in free-size, unstructured, unlined garments.''
These are simply yet sophisticated coats and jackets in self colours.
A timeless favourite is the cape. There are many versions of this. One
is cut in circular shape, with button fastening, hood and pointed scarf
to tie, lie or drape. It comes in olive green or red. Paula Ramsay of
Ramsay &amp; Hostler finds it a popular choice in her Edinburgh shop. ''It
adds a touch of glamour to a simple outfit of jeans and body,'' she
says. ''It is equally stunning with formal evening wear. It's one of
those wonderful garments which can be worn by anyone, regardless of age
or size.'' All of which just about sums up the appeal of the house of
Hourihan.

star similar to the Sun, a breakthrough that could accelerate the hunt
for other solar systems and boost theories of extraterrestrial life. The
discovery, if confirmed, would mark the first known planetary system

Los Angeles
THE father of murder victim Ronald Goldman is vowing to press ahead
with a lawsuit against O J Simpson and the family of Simpson's murdered
ex-wife may be having second thoughts about giving up custody of his
children.
In a sign that Simpson's legal troubles are far from over, Fred
Goldman said he would pursue a wrongful-death civil suit that could
force the former football star to take the witness stand and pay
millions of dollars in damages.
While Simpson's lead attorney, Johnnie Cochran, has appealed to the
victims' families to drop their civil complaints in order to bring
''closure'' to the wrenching murder case, Goldman said last night: ''Not
a chance.''
Another court battle may be brewing over who gets custody of Simpson's
children, seven-year-old Justin and nine-year-old Sydney, who have lived
with their maternal grandparents since their father's arrest more than
15 months ago for the killing of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and
her friend, Goldman.
After Simpson's acquittal on Tuesday, the Browns said they were
inclined to turn the children over to Simpson without a fight, but their
attorney, John Kelly, indicated in a television interview today they may
be reconsidering.
''There's one question about whether he'd be a fit parent, first of
all by the mountain of evidence that still exists even afer being
cleared in the criminal case,'' Kelly said. ''There's a lot of evidence
that suggests clearly that he killed the children's mother.''
Fred Goldman, who never wavered in his belief in Simpson's guilt, made
clear that he now thinks the football legend should pay the price in
cash. Asked whether his family can handle another trial, he said:
''Nothing can be as terrible to us as what happened on June 12, 1994. We
can take it.''
While Simpson faces no threat of jail in a civil trial, he could be
forced to testify, would need more than ''reasonable doubt'' to convince
a jury to exonerate him and could end up paying millions of dollars in
damages if he loses.
The latest word on the former football hero's legal problems came amid
reports that he is preparing to leave town as he tries to piece his life
back together after a sensational year-long trial.
Several local TV stations reported defence sources as saying Simpson
was preparing to get away for at least a week or two.
Other reports said he was considering moving from Los Angeles to New
York, where he owns an apartment, or Florida where his girlfriend, who
was reportedly smuggled into his mansion to welcome him home on his
first night of freedom, has a home.
The brother of Playboy model Paula Barbieri, Simpson's girlfriend,
hinted on the American Journal TV show that the two might marry.
''I think America will see in the next six months there will be
another O J Simpson marriage,'' Michael Barbieri said.--Reuter/AP.

Srinagar
THE health of two Britons and two other Western men being held hostage
in Kashmir is worsening as cold weather sets in and psychological
pressure mounts, Indian officials said today.
''The health of the hostages is deteriorating in extremely cold,
unhygienic conditions, restricted diet, and psychological pressure,''
said a police officer in Jammu, the winter capital of violence-torn
Jammu and Kashmir state.
Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells began their fourth month in
captivity this week with American Donald Hutchings and German Dirk
Hasert. All are being held in the Himalayan region where they were
snatched by Kashmiri rebels while trekking.
Authorities in Srinagar, the state's summer capital, said they have
not had contact with the Al-Faran guerrillas since talks were abruptly
broken off on September 19.
''We are waiting for Al-Faran to come back,'' said a local government
spokesman. ''There are no indications right now but we are hopeful.''
Despite the break in communication, the longest since the hostage
crisis began, authorities said they still have information that the men
are alive.
With the help of locals they have been able to keep close track of
them.
The Al-Faran group has demanded the release of several jailed
militants in return for the hostages. India has ruled out a direct swop,
but said some militants might be freed as part of a routine
review.--Reuter.

LIFE and ceasefires both come cheaply in Bosnia after 42 months of
bloodshed. They are part of the currency of despair across the
jigsaw-puzzle battlelines which divide the country into segments of
ethnic hatred.
Now a new ceasfire deal brokered by the Americans and backed warily by
the combatants looms on the horizon. On Tuesday, the guns are due to
fall silent. Until then, the gloves are off.
Many Croats, Serbs, and Muslims will die this weekend in a final
flurry of offensive action aimed at grabbing territory to be used as
bargaining chips in later negotiation.
By midnight on Monday, their fury spent, the rival armies will face
each other uneasily across 1000 kilometers of no-man's land.
This ceasefire will be the 37th. Some of its predecessors have lasted
weeks; others have held firm for only hours. The average is just short
of one a month. Itchy trigger fingers, mutual suspicion, and hidden
political agendas have conspired to frustrate all so far.
What makes this effort different, and potentially successful, may be
its timing and the attitudes of outside influences affecting the
protagonists.
Europe's backyard war may actually be drawing to a close, for the time
being.
The exhaustion of the armies in the field after the next three days'
frenzy will have much to do with the immediate cessation of hostilities.
The Bosnian Muslim offensive, following closely on the heels of the
earlier Croat blitzkrieg against the Serbs, came close to establishing
de facto possession of the proposed treaty carve-up of territory.
Serb counter-attacks in the last week were aimed at stabilising their
lines along a buffer-zone which would offer some protection to the
threatened stronghold of Banja Luka. Croat resistance was muted in this
sector. Many units were already pulling back on the basis it would be
pointless to die for ground likely to be surrendered at the stroke of a
pen.
The Muslims, with perhaps 120,000 men under arms, made progress only
because they were supported by Croat guns and tanks. Most of these have
withdrawn across the border.
The negotiators meeting in the United States on October 25 still face
an enormous task. Even if they cobble together a deal acceptable to all
sides, the seeds of future conflict have already been sown.
The US agenda in the peace process is easy to read. It was an American
drive which jolted Nato into a bombing campaign which paved the way for
the current initiative. Assailed but far from defeated, the Serbs were
weakened sufficiently to allow the Muslim-Croat federation to seize the
military advantage.
That coup did President Clinton's dented international reputation no
harm and helped underline US moral and physical leadership of Nato at a
time when Nato itself was seeking a meaningful role in Europe. It also
decoupled the UN from military decision-making to the relief of every
nation with contingents on vulnerable peacekeeping duty.
Now Clinton has promised to commit 25,000 US ground troops to a
Nato-commanded force which could be in place early next year to oversee
and police the expected treaty.
That could be a risky strategy. The US public wants to see the crisis
solved by US get-up-and-go. Its national pride might evaporate --
together with support for Clinton -- if American boys start coming home
in body-bags.
Under Clinton's plan, US advisers would also help train the
mainly-Muslim Bosnian government army. Ostensibly, this would offer the
Sarajevo regime a credible bulwark against future Serb or Croat
aggression. It would also mean lifting the arms embargo.
It takes about nine months to a year to turn raw recruits into
something resembling an effective fighting force. The timing is
important. If the Nato insurance force is committed early next year, and
if the fragile peace holds, it might be possible to bring US personnel
home in triumph just before the presidential elections scheduled for
November, 1996.
There are other hitches to the scheme. Russian suspicion over the
prospect of a Nato-led, and therefore US-led, military operation can be
overcome. The Russians will commit troops to reassure their traditional
allies, the Serbs, and some mechanism will be found to leave them under
Russian command, acting in parallel with Nato.
Britain and France, both arch-pragmatists in Balkan realpolitik, are
steadfastly opposed to US training and arming of the Muslims. They feel
that it would jeopardise the new Nato peacekeeping force's neutrality
and could light a burning fuse under the long-term peace process.
In addition, neither the Croats in Croatia itself nor the
ultra-nationalist Bosnian Croats in Herzegovina in the south of the
country will be likely to welcome a Muslim army tooled up for battle and
trained to professional military standards. The Bosnian Serbs have even
less reason to welcome the development.
The legacy of heavy weapons from the former Yugoslavian National Army
gave them their only telling advantage over their more numerous enemies.
Beyond the purely military numbers' game, the attitude of Serb general
Ratko Mladic could be crucial. As the architect of ethnic cleansing and
the mastermind of the Serbs' early successes in both Croatia and Bosnia,
he has become used to a centre stage role and lion's share of the
limelight.
As soon as the fighting stops, he will be relegated to a bit-part in
the wings. Given his ego, his ambition of creating a Greater Serbia, and
his hatred of all things Muslim and Croat, he might not take kindly to
that diminished participation in events. The Bosnian Serb army, or key
parts of it, might be inclined to follow his lead.
Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic has long tried to keep
Mladic on a leash. The self-styled 'Butcher of Bosnia' has so far defied
that level of control. Rumours of a coup were rife when Karadzic tried
to restrain his military commander in the spring. It may well have been
a dress rehearsal.
The only real restraint on further Bosnian Serb adventurism is
Slobodan Milosevic, the leader of Serbia itself. Belgrade has suffered
greatly from economic sanctions. Even its covert aid to its fellow-Serbs
across the Drina river all but dried up this year.
Now Milosevic has been presented with a golden opportunity to end both
the conflict and the sanctions and escape with some kudos. In a personal
sense, he might also escape prosecution as a war criminal. It was his
political scheming which led to the break-up of the Yugoslav state in
1991 and a spate of wars which have killed more than 300,000 people.
Another major potential fly in the ointment is the question of Eastern
Slavonia, the oil-rich strip of Croatia seized and held by the Serbs in
1992. Croatia has vowed to mount a new offensive to recover it if
diplomacy fails. The Serbs have vowed to hold it.
It also borders Serbia proper and has all the hallmarks of an area
where the entire war -- this time on a wider scale -- might be
re-ignited.
Under the Holbrooke plan, Bosnia would continue to be a single entity,
divided into a Muslim-Croat federation and a Serb republic with the
right to affiliate to its big brother across the Drina. But it is a
broad-brush solution, fraught with infinite possibilities for calamity.
Shuttle diplomacy and the application of the big-stick have, at least,
brought grudging initial agreement from the regimes to halt the killing.
If the ceasefire holds until representatives can meet to continue the
fight across a table instead of a trenchline, then the world must keep
its fingers crossed that a more permanent end is in sight.

Moscow
THE Russian government today called on President Boris Yeltsin to
declare a state of emergency in the Chechen capital Grozny after a bomb
blast seriously injured a Russian general.
Several Russian soldiers were killed or wounded as they travelled with
him in a convoy in Grozny.
Nationalities Minister Vyacheslav Mikhailov, Moscow's top peace
negotiator in Chechnya, said Lieutenant General Anatoly Romanov suffered
an ''open skull brain injury'' and that doctors had described his
condition as ''very serious''.
A Cabinet statement said: ''The Russian Government considers that it
is necessary under the circumstances to introduce a state of emergency
in Grozny.''
A spokesman for President Yeltsin said before the statement was issued
that Moscow would stick to agreements with Chechen rebels despite the
bombing. --Reuter.

Paris
A BOMB placed in a litter bin outside a Paris Metro station exploded
this afternoon, slightly injuring 13 people.
Casualties could have been worse if a postman had not spotted a
suspicious bag and alerted police, who cordoned off the Avenue d'Italie,
next to the Maison Blanche underground station in the south of the
French capital.
''It was a big boom,'' said Laetitia Lhospital, 28, a perfume shop
clerk. ''There was a lot of smoke; people poured into the street. I'm
very frightened. My heart is still beating very fast.''
Today's attack coincided with the funeral of Khaled Kelkal, a top
suspect in the recent wave of bombings across France, who was shot dead
by police last Friday in a small village -- also called Maison Blanche
-- outside Lyons.
Kelkal's death has angered many who contend police gunned him down
only because he was Muslim and rioting left more than 100 cars destroyed
in poor, mainly immigrant suburbs in the Lyon area.
It was the seventh bombing or attempted bombing since July 25 when a
gas canister loaded with nuts and bolts, similar to the one in today's
blast, exploded in the heart of Paris. Seven people have been killed in
the blasts and more than 140 injured.
Officials have linked the bombings to Algerian Muslim militants
targeting France for financial support of Algeria's military government.
''It's clear that there is a strategy to impress us,'' Justice
Minister Jacques Toubon told the National Assembly, shortly after the
blast. ''We must remain vigilant.''--AP/Reuter.

Brussels
THE career of Nato secretary general Willy Claes was in deepening
crisis last night after the Belgian courts concluded that he should be
charged with a criminal role in the Agusta helicopter scandal.
The Agusta affair has rocked Belgian politics and brought several
ministerial resignations, a sensational suicide, and an unsolved murder.
Mr Claes, who is currently wrestling with Nato's pivotal role in
Bosnia, was Belgium's respected Foreign Minister when the Italian
helicopter company Agusta was discovered to be paying off politicians in
Belgium and France in return for orders.
Mr Claes has always protested his complete innocence. However his case
appeared increasingly shaky earlier this year after he suddenly admitted
to a ''vague memory'' of ''offers'' which, he said, he took nothing to
do with.
Last night he defied calls for his resignation from Nato, saying he
planned to carry on as head of the Alliance.
''I am confident in justice,'' he said. ''I am totally innocent, I
have never done anything wrong.''
A Belgian radio station reported last night that the country's highest
court had reported to the Belgian Parliament that Mr Claes should face
charges.
''The public prosecutor is accusing Claes of corruption and forgery,''
BRTN radio reported.
A special parliamentary commission is working on a request from the
courts to continue an investigation into Mr Claes's role in the payment
of kickbacks by Agusta in return for a #200m order.
Since the investigations began, a retired general has committed
suicide and a prominent politician has been gunned down in a Mafia-style
killing in Liege. The resignations of three ministers almost wrecked the
former coalition government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.
The affair has gripped Belgian newspaper readers and television
viewers. One Belgian newspaper's investigative reporters discovered
their own publication was being secretly funded by the party alleged to
have received bribes.
Members of an investigating commission considered a report by Mr
Jacques Velu, prosecutor general, before being shown all the documents
on the case earlier this week.
BRTN radio said Parliament would have to decide on the prosecutor's
request in a plenary session but did not give a date. It also said that
former Defence Minister Guy Coeme faced corruption and forgery charges
in a similar case.

THE director of a worldwide refugee service, visiting Glasgow for an
international aid conference today, said the Bosnian ceasefire would be
an ''immense'' help in dealing with the refugee crisis in the former
Yugoslavia.
However Fr Mark Raper warned that it was unlikely to result in a
permanent end to hostilities.
Fr Raper, international director of the Jesuit Refugee Service, spoke
to journalists before taking part in events marking the 30th anniversary
of the foundation of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund
(SCIAF).
Fr Raper is due to address a conference at Strathclyde University
today. He will be guest preacher at a Mass of Thanksgiving with Cardinal
Thomas Winning and most of the Scottish bishops tomorrow.
Fr Raper said: ''The ceasefire will be an immense help in dealing with
refugees in the former Yugoslavia, but Bosnia is still a divided country
preoccupied by an ethnic split.
''A temporary compromise has been reached and I hope that leads to
demilitarisation, but I don't think it is a permanent solution.''
He said the ceasefire was inherently weak because it had been brought
about by Nato military intervention rather than by negotiation. Several
territories were still disputed by the military factions, he added.
The Jesuit Refugee Service operates in 48 countries around the world.
It estimates that more than three million people have been forcibly
displaced in the past three years as a result of the Balkan conflict. A
further 200,000 are thought to have died in the war.
The agency is running several projects in Bosnia and Croatia. It aims
to improve education standards and encourage ethnic and religious groups
to work together.
Fr Raper said: ''I am thrilled that there has been a ceasefire because
it will allow us greater access to certain areas, particularly when
delivering supplies.''

THE Scottish Arts Council may be at odds with Scottish Opera over its
decision to reject the Robertson Report's recommendation to disband its
own orchestra and buy in the services of the BBC Scottish Symphony
Orchestra, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, and the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra.
But on one point, all the major arts organisation are as one -- that
the Government is underfunding the arts and has done so for some time.
Last year, the Scottish Arts Council received a 0.7% increase in
grant-in-aid and this year received 2.94% extra. For the next three
years the SAC has been told to plan on a standstill basis -- which it
argues is an effective cut. It claims, therefore, that by the year 1999,
more than #2.2m in real terms will have been lost from SAC's budget, a
reduction of 9%.
For its part, Scottish Opera claims it has been dogged by problems of
underfunding throughout its 33-year history.
Three years ago, the SAC proposed, and received some support from the
board of Scottish Opera, that the opera orchestra be merged with the BBC
SSO. However, the plan was vigorously opposed by the players of both
orchestras and abandoned.
Yesterday, both Sir Lewis Robertson, author of the Collaboration
Working Group report, and the SAC said that Scottish Opera's current
financial crisis might have been avoided had that merger gone ahead.
Professor Gavin McCrone, a member of Scottish Opera's board, said,
however, that while the merger might have resulted in some savings, they
would have been ''nothing like enough'' to avert the current crisis.
Mr Richard Jarman, the company's general director, said: ''On the
basis of the criteria that the SAC asked us to work on of stand-still
funding, the figures that we submitted to them would have meant that we
would still be falling short by between #560,000 and #817,000 in the
three years from 1996/97 to 1998/99.''
He added that Scottish Opera would have had to pay the other
orchestras and this was estimated at between #600,000 and #900,000 over
three years.
However, Sir Lewis Robertson, speaking from Australia, said that
because Scottish Opera had rejected his working group's proposal in
principle, the committee had not had the chance to explore the costs any
further.
''Mr Jarman's figures have to be qualified because the matter was not
discussed to sufficient depth with at least the BBC SSO to work out what
the financial out-turn would be,'' said Sir Lewis.
Matthew Rooke, music director of the SAC, endorsed that view, saying
that Mr Jarman had never had detailed negotiations with the BBC SSO,
RSNO or SCO to know what the costs would have been.
SAC figures show that between 1991 and 1994, Scottish Opera's audience
has declined by 34%, its performances declined by 11%, and its subsidy
has increased by 12.5%, with SAC subsidy per seat in the year 1993/94 at
#63.12. By contrast, the RSNO's audiences have declined by 12%, its
performances by 5%, and its subsidy has gone up by 5%. The SCO has seen
a 5% decline in audience, a 11% decline in performances, and a 17%
increase in subsidy. The orchestras' subsidies per seat are,
respectively, #13.50 and #30.25.
Sir Lewis said that these figures had not influenced the working group
in its conclusions.
Any Minister would have to think hard before he decided he could
afford to put more money into arts, said Sir Lewis.
He also predicted that before too long there would be a change in the
rules governing the distribution of National Lottery funds ''because
once we have paid for a football stadium in every village in the
country, they will have to think: what else they are going to do?''
Part of Scottish Opera's argument for more funding rests on
comparisons it makes with Welsh National Opera and Opera North.
Scottish Opera receives #5.36m for the current financial year,
compared to Welsh National Opera's #6.59m and Opera North's #5.94m.
Scottish Opera feels it is in an impossible situation. Its orchestra
is under-used -- some say to the tune of 50% -- but it argues that that
is because under-funding prevents it from performing at more venues.
An additional #2m grant would allow to expand its operation throughout
Scotland, to put on more medium-scale productions and opera concerts,
and to put them on in venues such as Dundee, Perth, and Stirling, thus
utilising its members to a greater extent and bringing opera to a much
wider audience. Were this to happen, argues Richard Jarman, the SAC's
level of subsidy per seat would drop drastically.
For its part, the SAC says that to find the #1.25m required to fund
Scottish Opera for 1996/97, funding would have to be removed from other
areas of the arts in Scotland. Such a scale of cuts would involve one
of:
* Cutting all support for the Edinburgh International Festival
(#747,000), the MacRobert Arts Centre (#160,000) and from all music
ensembles and groups (#240,000).
* The loss of major theatres -- The Citizens' in Glasgow (#628,000)
and the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh (#1m.).
* Withdrawing support from all the independent art galleries and
printmakers and sculpture workshops throughout Scotland (#1.2m.).
As Matthew Rooke said, if the SAC abandoned its support of Scottish
literature, ''James Kelman would run out of expletives''.
Meanwhile, the SAC is bracing itself for funding problems likely to be
faced by other major arts organisations -- #300,000 in the case of the
RSNO, and #200,000 for the SCO.

THE Serious Fraud Office yesterday announced its intention to quash a
private attempt to bring Mr Nick Leeson to Britain for trial over the
#860m collapse of Barings Bank.
It said it was taking over the prosecution on charges of deception and
false accounting launched last week by Barings bondholders who lost more
than #50m in the collapse.
''The director of the SFO considers that it is not in the public
interest for there to be a prosecution of Mr Leeson in the UK in the
present circumstances,'' a spokeswoman said. ''The director will be
applying for the withdrawal of summonses issued at the magistrates'
court.''
Mr David Harrel, the bondholders' lawyer, said they would fight any
attempt to discontinue the prosecution ''strenuously''.
They would seek to argue before the City of London magistrates' court,
which issued the eight summonses against Mr Leeson, that they should not
be withdrawn. They would consider asking the High Court for a judicial
review, if that failed.
Three days ago a German court approved Mr Leeson's extradition to
Singapore for trial on 11 charges of fraud and forgery. However, this
could be delayed by up to a year by defence plans to appeal to the
country's federal constitutional court.
The Crown can adopt any private prosecution, either to abandon or
proceed with it. Traditionally, cases are discontinued only when they
are vexatious, frivolous or incorrectly put together.
Mr Harrel said the only motive for stopping the private prosecution
appeared to be to maintain good diplomatic relations with the island
state.
He said Singapore's charges against Mr Leeson were minor: ''Our
charges are the fundamental ones which go to the collapse of Barings.''
The SFO has ruled out seeking Mr Leeson's trial in Britain, and Board
of Trade President Ian Lang is on record as saying that ''Singapore has
a stronger claim for extradition of Mr Leeson than the United Kingdom.''
Mr Leeson's lawyer, Mr Stephen Pollard, was not in his office
yesterday and a member of staff said he would be issuing no statement.
Conservative MP Tristan Garel-Jones, whose Watford constituency
includes Mr Leeson's family home, said he was ''very surprised'' by the
SFO decision and called on the office to explain the reasons behind it.
Labour MP Denis MacShane, who has taken a close interest in the Leeson
case, denounced yesteray's SFO decision as ''scandalous'' and ''a
disgrace''.
He said the SFO was reacting to political pressure from the
Conservative Party, which wanted to avoid the embarrassment of a Leeson
trial in the UK and was affecting ''the banking cover-up of the
century''.
Mr MacShane said he would write to the Attorney General to demand a
full parliamentary statement and would be tabling questions on the
matter in Parliament.

HEALTH executives have begun an inquiry after a 57-year-old woman died
in a hospital lift only hours after she had been sent home.
Grandmother Mrs Winifred Angus collapsed and died of a heart attack on
the second occasion her husband took her to hospital in the same day.
Her husband, Alistair, had just been told by doctors to go home when
his wife died while she was being taken to a ward.
The tragedy happened at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, where senior
cardiologists warned only last week that inadeqate access to diagnostic
equipment was contributing to the deaths of heart patients.
More than 20 patients have died in the past three years before their
complaints could be investigated.
Mrs Angus had been admitted to a medical ward at Ninewells on
Wednesday of last week after complaining of chest pains. She underwent
major heart surgery two years ago.But she was sent home hours after she
was admitted.
Later that night Mrs Angus was taken by ambulance to Ninewells and
died in the lift while she was being taken back to the same general
medical ward.
Mr Angus, of Lochee, Dundee, was too upset to speak yesterday.
A spokesman for Ninewells said the investigation could not be
completed until the senior medical staff involved returned from annual
leave.
He added: ''A report will be sent to the patient's representatives as
soon as the circumstances involved have been established.''

LABOUR'S Scottish home affairs spokesman John McFall MP yesterday
condemned Mr Michael Forsyth's view that community service orders are a
soft option.
He said the Scottish Secretary showed ''a complete lack of
understanding'' of the orders' purpose.
Mr McFall was speaking during a tour of Airborne Initiative, a test
community scheme run by former Parachute Regiment servicemen at Renfrew.
His comments followed an address to businessmen last month in which Mr
Forsyth advocated that schemes should involve ''hard physical work, not
brutality, but offenders in protective clothing which advertises what
they are.''
Mr McFall said: ''We cannot bring young offenders back into society by
humiliating them. People who have committed criminal acts lack a sense
of responsibility to society and their fellow citizens and this is the
problem which must be addressed.''
Airborne Initiative, undertaken on a voluntary basis by offenders,
involves 10 weeks' intensive outdoor training and work skills, with the
guarantee of a job or a training place for those who complete it.

THE search for villains is as fruitless as it is time-consuming. The
SAC may be privately gnashing teeth at what it sees as Scottish Opera's
intransigence in the face of fiscal realities. The company itself may
seethe at what it perceives as a Philistine disregard for the future of
one of Scotland's principal cultural virility symbols.
The other orchestras consulted in yet another attempt to stitch
together a rescue plan which would stand a reasonable test of time may
be wondering, not unnaturally, if anyone is taking time out to examine
their marginally less urgent but very real difficulties in balancing the
books.
But I have yet to encounter any players in this long running backstage
opera who do not genuinely want a solution which provides the best
possible outcome for the maximum number of people. The priorities may
vary, but the agenda is shared.
On the face of it Scottish Opera may seem in some quarters to be
suffering from a reality bypass. After two major infusions of extra cash
in the last few years they continue to live beyond their current means
and their in-house orchestra, a major oncost, is still desperately under
utlised despite heroic efforts to create work outside the production
schedules.
Its financial headaches have produced a decline of 11% in performances
which have contributed to a drop of more than 30% in their audience and
a seat subsidy which has almost doubled. The public purse now
contributes just over #63 for the privilege of putting bottoms on
Scottish Opera seats.
But the arithmetic is more complex than that snapshop suggests. The
Scottish Arts Council repeatedly makes the point that the national opera
company now accounts for over a fifth of its budget and more crumbs from
a shrinking cake are not an option.
But they are similarly opposed to any moves to remove the national
cultural institutions from their budget, convinced that direct
government funding would be a dangerous departure from established
precedent.
Yet when you examine operatic provision in other small countries their
government seems neither parsimonious nor embarrassed about supporting
this particular art form.
Israel puts #5m into opera (with one or two other things on its
budgetary mind) while the Scandinavian countries and European neighbours
like Germany seem to regard support for opera as a hallmark of a
civilised society.
And looked at through that end of the telescope public subsidy seems
not so much a frightening oncost as a a logical way of increasing
provision and making the product more accessible.
Much has been made of opera being performed to only 0.8% of Scots. But
one of the corollaries of the policy of high investment in other
countries has been vastly cheaper seat prices which, in turn, has
eradicated any charge of eltitism and let opera stand or fall on its
natural appeal.
And if anyone doubts the appeal factor they need only look at the
recording and video receipts from the three tenors.
There is of course a third source of major core funding beyond the SAC
or the Scottish Office receipts and that is the bonanza of the national
lottery.
The current rules will only allow funding for capital assets, but is
it beyond the wit of creative accountancy to see the commission of a new
and innovative work with a long shelf life in this light?
After all the guidelines have been spectacularly bent for film. The
SAC fret that if lottery money went to their clients the Government
would use that as an excuse to shrink their overall allocation. And it
might. But that might be another valid reason for losing the big boys
from the client list.
When lottery money went to the Royal Opera House the cry went up that
the poor were subsidising the rich which managed spectacularly to miss
the point. Opera is only a rich man's game because of the price, not the
content. Use the money to widen access and we'll pull in the fans
instead of the snobs.
In fairness you might well argue that SO have not themselves given
proper priority to widen access and that they ought to spend more time
thinking laterally about how an expensive product could be delivered in
imaginative but less costly ways to many more parts of Scotland
currently under-refreshed.
The kind of national opera company we have is a matter of fair debate;
surely to goodness we aren't in the market for no longer having one. If
we did 1995 would go down as the musical equivalent of 1707 when,
uniquely, we managed to get rid of our own parliament.
You might argue too that the solution urged by the chair of the
working party housed fewer dangers than the route on which Scottish
Opera has now embarked. Bound to put in a non deficit budget proposal
for next year it has plumped for a nine month season allied to a high
profile campaign to secure better funding.
Sir Lewis Robertson's conclusion was that the disbandment of the in
house orchestra with provision coming from the SCO, the RSNO, and the
BBC SSO would not only save Scot Op's overall bacon but enhance the
opportunities for the other bands.
The arguments flagged up by Scottish Opera's board after three
agonised meetings were that such a game plan would be a scheduling
nightmare, would lose artistic standards and autonomy and would leave
the company bottom of the des res league with future candidates for
musical director. (Richard Armstrong would undoubtedly pack his bags.)
All valid points, well made. But these are problems which just might
be turned into opportunities. Whereas a part-time company risks
withering on the vine, especially when it shuts up shop during the best
showcase of all, the Edinburgh International Festival.
Two separate investigations have now come to the conclusion that
either an orchestral merger or collaborative provision are the only
viable options under current resources. Scottish Opera has rejected
both. Fighting to the last sinew for more resources is admirable. But
the ultimate price of going part time could be incalculable.

BRITISH Gas was at the centre of a new row yesterday after deciding to
switch Scottish pension administration south of the Border.
SNP energy spokesperson Ms Nicola Sturgeon said the company had
stripped all its management functions from Scotland and was now moving
administrative matters.
''This matter only came to our attention when angry British Gas
pensioners contacted us complaining about the transfer,'' she said.
''It is part and parcel of British Gas abolishing their regional tier
of management -- including the Scottish area based in Edinburgh -- and
its replacement with five business units based in England. Yet Scotland
supplies about one-third of British Gas's current supplies.''
British Gas yesterday confirmed the Edinburgh unit dealing with the
administration of pensions for ex-employees has been merged with
national administration in Basingstoke. The rationalisation will result
in the loss of 10 jobs across the UK through voluntary redundancy.
However, a spokeswoman said pensioners would suffer no loss of service
and because funds were now being dealt with as one unit, special deals
could be arranged.

JOHN Lord, Scottish Enterprise's director of strategy, has quit his
#65,000-a-year post for a job in the private sector.
He has told colleagues the move is for career reasons.
However, there is speculation within the organisation's Glasgow
headquarters that the departure is because he feels his ambition to
succeed Mr Crawford Beveridge as chief executive has been thwarted.
Mr Robert Crawford, 43, a former director of Locate in Scotland, has
been promoted to managing director operations, and is now regarded as
the crown prince in Bothwell Street.
Mr Lord, who is also 43, looked a potential successor to Mr Beveridge
when he moved from running one of the LECs, Enterprise Ayrshire, to the
critical job of mapping out a fresh strategy for the whole organisation.
That job has been completed and with Mr Crawford running the
organisation on a day-to-day basis, Mr Lord's future role, had he
stayed, would have been confined to further updating and refining
strategy.
He is now joining EDAW, a London-based planning and economic
development consultancy, which works widely with the local enterprise
companies in the Scottish network. It is thought Mr Lord will be running
its Glasgow office.
A former career civil servant with the Training Agency, Mr Lord was
the only LEC chief executive to have moved into the core organisation.
Stepping back into a LEC role would have looked like a retrograde step.
He has chosen the private sector instead.

<HEADLINE>Forsyth truce is over. Let battles recommence, says Cosla vice-president.</HEADLINE>

A SENIOR council leader yesterday declared an end to the uneasy truce
between the Scottish Secretary and large sections of local government.
Cosla's vice-president, Mr Keith Geddes, told a summit of council
leaders in Pitlochry that Mr Michael Forsyth's probationary period was
over. Old battles, he said, were set to recommence.
Councillor Geddes, Labour leader of the new City of Edinburgh Council,
said recent events had shown that Mr Forsyth was not the friendly,
listening politician he had portrayed himself as.
He claimed Mr Forsyth was trying to distance himself from the damage
and upheaval caused by local government reorganisation, as if the
changes had nothing to do with the Secreary of State or the Tories.
He also described the Scottish Office's publication earlier this week
of a list of senior appointments made by the new councils as ''perhaps
the most disgraceful episode I have seen in local government in recent
years''.
The list showed the varying number of senior officials earning more
than #42,000 appointed so far. However, it was described as incomplete
and ''crude and premature'' by council leaders.
Mr Geddes's declaration that hostilities will resume follows The
Herald's report earlier this week that relations between the Scottish
Office and Cosla had slumped dramatically.
Mr Forsyth's early attempt to woo local government with talk of
returning powers to councils and perhaps abolishing capping of council
budgets has ended in acrimony as Ministers have become increasingly
angered by ''jobs for the boys'' rows over appointments and the
widespread payment by the new councils of sizable councillors'
allowances.
Cosla has asked for an additional #15m to help pay this year's cost of
reorganisation, but Ministers are insisting councils must show such a
sum is justified.
Yesterday's full meeting of Cosla also discussed a blueprint for a new
streamlined convention after the reorganisation is complete.
It was agreed to put the plan for a 100-member Cosla, with just five
or six super-committees, before each of the new councils.
Mr Geddes said the main aim was to make Cosla ''a dynamic, pro-active,
outward-looking organisation'' which could meet the changing needs of
local government.
Scottish local government is dominated by the Labour Party, but
convention leaders insist they want the new organisations to be less
party political and less oriented towards the cities and the central
belt.
* Local authority leaders yesterday supported a call to halt the
importation of foreign nuclear waste for reprocessing at Dounreay.
At the Cosla meeting in Pitlochry, they backed a motion by Aberdeen
District Council which stressed alleged dangers to the public and the
environment posed by the transportation and reprocessing of spent
nuclear fuel at the Dounreay facility.

The Local Government Staff Commission was accused of ''a serious error
of judgment'' yesterday by a leading Glasgow-based academic.
Professor Alan Alexander of Strathclyde University said the commission
had been wrong to advertise the posts of chief executives for the new
councils before the authorities themselves had actually been elected and
had their first meetings.
By acting as a mail box for applications, the commission had sent out
a message that there was a greater urgency about the establishment of
management structures than was actually the case.
The ''unseemly haste'' in making appointments to the new councils
which had followed, had led many of them simply to recreate the
management structures which already operated in the regions and
districts, Professor Alexander told a conference in Peebles organised by
the Association of Direct Labour Authorities.
He claimed that the new vested interests would now make it more
difficult for the councils to be radical for the future over their
management and decision-making structures.

THE origins of the working group that produced the so-called Robertson
report, published yesterday, lie in the changes of personnel at the top
of several of Scotland's major musical organisations.
Five years ago the principal contact between Scotland's orchestras was
during battles over territorial rights. The barons in charge of the
Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra
eventually moved on, and new chief executives Paul Hughes and Roy McEwan
moved in.
They started talking, then collaborating, and several projects
featuring their own orchestras and, in a series in Perth, the BBC
Scottish Symphony Orchestra, were launched.
In the course of informal discussions, common areas of concern --
funding, available work, how to make best use of resources -- emerged.
Together with Scottish Opera, the RSNO and SCO sat down with the
Scottish Arts Council to discuss what kind of investigative work could
be undertaken to maximise, for the three companies, the work that could
be undertaken within existing resources.
So a working group was formally inaugurated to investigate
possiblities of further collaborations. It was comprised of the chairmen
and chief excutives of each company, with the Scottish Arts Council
providing administrative services. Sir Lewis Robertson was invited to
become chairman, and a series of meetings began in May.
At the outset, the report says, the group agreed that the exercise
would only be of any value if it was completely open-ended, with the
members free to contemplate the full range of options, however
theoretical or unpalatable they night seem. The understanding was,
however, that the adoption of any recommendation would depend on all
three approving.
All three agreed that without increased revenue income, current
operating patterns would be difficult to sustain. Scottish Opera needed
an additional #750,000 per year, the RSNO #300,000, and the SCO some
#200,000.
As the exercise of cost controls was deemed not to provide an adequate
solution, the option of sharing resources, of some form of orchestral
collaboration, was brought into play.
A wide range of models drawing on the combined resources of the RSNO,
the SCO, and Scottish Opera was drawn up for consideration.
Scottish Opera expressed its concern about the dependence on external
agencies involved in any of the models.
At this point, the RSNO and SCO demurred, pointing to other British
and European models, from Glyndebourne to Vienna, where independent
orchestras are used in opera houses.
The report acknowledged the ''fundamental difference of opinion''
within the working group.
Then the spectrum was broadened to bring in the BBC SSO as a third
potential provider of orchestral resource to Scottish Opera. Sir Lewis
Robertson met with John McCormick, Controller of BBC Scotland. The BBC
SSO was asked if it could provide four or five productions per year for
Scottish Opera, with the RSNO playing two or three, and the SCO one or
two.
This option, using three external orchestras, was felt by some members
of the working group to be the only viable model.
The conclusion of the working group's investigation accepted that it
might not prove possible to reconcile everybody's needs. It was also
suggested the the best they might be able to do was to recommend what
they cumbersomely called a ''least-worst'' solution.
The RSNO, SCO, and BBC SSO indicated that they were prepared to
explore the matter further. The Scottish Opera management took the issue
back to their board, which unanimously rejected any further discussions
or negotiations.
Instead, Scottish Opera submitted to the Scottish Arts Council its own
option, the part-time, flexible contract option, keeping its own
orchestra but putting the whole company on a September to May operating
basis -- which it admitted yesterday might well contain the seeds of
destruction for the company -- and called a press conference.

As Scottish Opera prepares to go part-time, Herald writers look at a
company in crisis.
RICHARD Armstrong, the music director of Scottish Opera since 1993,
yesterday launched an impassioned plea for public and financial support
to save the company as an integrated unit, and warned that if Scottish
Opera was forced to go part time, it would be used as a precedent for
other UK opera companies.
He said that the orchestra of Scottish Opera was ''second to none in
the UK'' and must be preserved. Deploring cuts that already have had to
be made in the company's productions, Mr Armstrong said: ''I will have
absolutely nothing to do with any attempt to disband the orchestra.''
In 1973, while he was music director of Welsh National Opera, Richard
Armstrong founded that company's in-house orchestra, the first full-time
opera orchestra outside London. It became a model for all others, said
Mr Armstrong, including Scotland.
''I find it inconceivable that the Scots can't have what the Welsh
have,'' he said. ''Any demise of this company would set the most
terrible precedent for opera in the UK; and make no mistake about it --
it will be used as a precedent.''
Mr Armstrong said he was ''devastated'' that the Scottish Arts Council
could find neither the will nor the support to secure the future of
Scottish Opera as a full-time company.
He spoke of the effort in the creation of Scottish Opera over 30 years
ago by Sir Alexander Gibson, and said: ''I cannot believe that this will
be Sir Alexander's memorial. I urge everybody to take a positive line to
preserve Scottish Opera for the Scottish people.''
The orchestra itself, half of which is currently performing in
Inverness with the Moscow Festival Ballet, is ''greatly heartened'' by
the stance taken by the board of the opera company. ''At last they have
got their act together in support of the orchestra as an intrinsic part
of the company,'' said one member.
The players' committee will meet in Glasgow at the weekend and may
seek the permission of the management to make a public statement next
week.
The three unions whose members work for Scottish Opera were divided
over the intention of the company to go part time. The Musicians' Union
placed itself firmly behind the management and the orchestra. ''We find
it totally unacceptable that once again the orchestra of Scottish Opera
should be separated off for special attention,'' said Scottish organiser
Ian Smith.
Equity, representing the chorus and stage management, said that, in
threatening to go part time, Scottish Opera had elected to play poker
with the work force. ''That is totally unacceptable,'' said Lorne
Boswell, Scottish organiser of Equity. ''It is a matter of fact that the
company is underfunded, but we cannot join in if they're threatening
members' jobs.''
Paul McManus, Scottish officer of Bectu, which has 110 members in the
230-strong opera company, rejected Scottish Opera's proposal as ''ill
thought-out and unacceptable''. Bectu believes that Scottish Opera is
engaging in political brinksmanship to secure funding at the eleventh
hour, said Mr McManus. ''And the way they have gone about it is
incomprehensible.''
Bectu and Equity stated independently that they believe the sale of
the Theatre Royal remains a viable option, and should be thoroughly
explored.
The managers of the two other arts council-funded orchestras involved
in the working group said yesterday that the underfunding problem is not
exclusive to Scottish Opera but is one that applies to all the national
companies.
Roy McEwan, managing director of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, said
yesterday that the deficit in his own organisation, until now a
''modest'' #80,000, was set to double in the current financial year.
''The position is deteriorating and by next year we will have a serious
financial crisis.''
Failure to meet sponsorship target and the virtual collapse of foreign
touring were the reasons, said Mr McEwan.
Paul Hughes, chief executive if the Royal Scottish National Orchestra,
said that in his organisation, too ''financial problems are looming and
will be here by the end of the current year. The ongoing financial
crisis must be addressed before the rest of us are forced to go
part-time or worse.''
On the proposal in the Robertson report to disband the opera orchestra
and call in the other national orchestras, Roy McEwan of the SCO said
there was an important point of distinction to be made.
The body of the report, looking at all models of collaboration, was
the work of the group, he said. He admitted there was only one that had
any practical life. ''But there we stopped,'' he said. ''The
recommendation that that model should be investigated is Sir Lewis
Robertson's own.''
Mr McEwan said he respected the right of the opera board to reject the
reccommendation. ''We wouldn't want to be seen to be bludgeoning
Scottish Opera, or anyone.''
As for the future, Mr McEwan said: ''We'll keep knocking on the door
of the Scottish Arts Council and the Scottish Office, and hope that
eventually they will listen.''
Paul Hughes of the RSNO said that, personally, he found it odd that
the Scottish Arts Council should have expressed ''no particular
preference for whichever option Scottish Opera recommended, whether the
collaborative proposal, or the part-time scenario''.
One union observer commented that the SAC was effectively ''doing a
Pontius Pilate'' and washing its hands of Scottish Opera.

SCOTLAND'S teenagers work longer hours and earn more in part-time jobs
than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK, according to a survey by
the Halifax Building Society.
About a fifth of Scotland's 10-15 age group work an average of
seven-and-a-half hours every week and earn #14.57. Across the UK, the
comparative figures are five-and-a-half hours, and #10.26.
Almost two-thirds save most or all of their money, compared to a UK
norm of 55%, but proportionally more income is then passed to overseas
charities, and to help the homeless.
Even their pocket money is ahead, rising by 13% over the past two
years to stand at #4.06 a week, well ahead of the British norm of #3.60.

It looks certain that the crofters in the nine townships of Melness
will accept the offer from Nottinghamshire-based Mr Michel Foljambe
whose family have owned the 32,000 acre Melness and Hope Estate in
north-west Sutherland since 1952. Mr Foljambe, 61, travels north rarely
now, and often lets out his lodge to sporting tenants.
He said yesterday: ''I suppose it always seemed to me that the
crofting townships formed a ring fence and could stand independently. I
put forward the idea and asked if they were interested and I am happy to
say they have come back and said they are.
''Now we will have to have meetings with our lawyers and such like, so
we are still some time off signing and sealing the agreement but we hope
it will proceed.''
The crofters' steering group chairman, Mr Frank Gordon, was
unavailable yesterday, but it is understood the crofters only decided to
proceed once they had held talks with the Assynt Crofters Trust.
The news was immediately welcomed by the SNP's land spokesman Mr Rob
Gibson: ''Following in the footsteps of Assynt and Borve, the Melness
crofters are proposing a crofting trust which will give new strength to
existing and aspiring crofters of all ages. This is another example of
the new faith being shown by Highlanders in the future potential of
their land as a base for a productive and sustainable life.
''Given the proof that many more people see the potential for jobs in
crofting/forestry, it would be a most significant step if the nearby
Sutherland Estates set an example to lairds across the north by offering
every crofting community control over their crofts and communal
grazing.''
There was no-one available to comment at the Sutherland estate offices
in Golspie.

Washington
PRESIDENT Clinton today began preparing Americans to send troops to
Bosnia to keep the peace.
In a speech this morning, he pointed out that after years of war,
murder, and hatred, a strong external force must be deployed once a
peace treaty is signed, to enforce it, and that only Nato could provide
it.
This force would require 20,000 or 25,000 American troops, with clear
rules of engagement which would permit immediate reaction against any
effort by either side to violate the treaty.
He did not discuss the further, and even greater, difficulty of
rebuilding the Bosnian nation, even though this remains a key to
American policy.
He was eloquent and forceful, saying exactly what an American
president should have said when Yugoslavia started to break up.
The change in policy here, that occurred last June after the Serbs
seized Srebrenica and massacred its defenders, has brought Mr Clinton to
the point where he has to send American troops into the Balkans, despite
continuing strong opposition by the Republicans, who control Congress.
The president cited his decisions last year to intervene in Haiti, and
early this year to rescue the Mexican economy from collapse. On both
occasions, the Republicans opposed him and, on both occasions, he said,
events proved that he had been right.
He claimed the US had to exercise leadership, and he evidently
proposes to continue providing it. This is a big change from a president
who ignored foreign affairs as much as possible during his first two
years in office.
Republican presidents discovered in years past how hard it is to run a
foreign policy opposed by Congress. Mr Clinton will find it very
difficult to swing the Republicans behind him on Bosnia, and will be
tempted to circumvent them by using his powers as commander in chief,
simply to direct the Pentagon to send American troops from Germany to
police Bosnia.
Congress may simply refuse to pay, as a Democratic Congress refused to
pay for President Reagan's Nicaragua policies. Not only must the US find
the money -- as well as the men -- for a peace-keeping force, but the
American share of restoring the Bosnian economy is likely to reach
$2000m over the next few years.
Many observers, including diplomats who resigned in disgust, point out
that acting forcefully in 1991 to stop the dismemberment of Bosnia would
have cost far less.
That is too late to worry about now. The problem today is persuading
Republicans, who are trying to balance the budget without upsetting
their own key constituencies, that they must find billions for the
Balkans. It will not be easy.
The president also has to persuade the American people.
The worst scenario for him would be to send in the troops late this
year, and for fighting to break out, with American casualties, in the
course of next year -- during the election campaign.
The events in Somalia in 1993, showed how unpopular such losses can
be.
In the same speech, the president announced some slight loosening of
the restrictions on Cuba. The economic blockade will continue unabated,
but American news organisations will be allowed to open bureaux there,
and Cuban reporters will be allowed to operate here.

Race on to restore power to Bosnian capital and meet key condition of
newly-won truce.
Sarajevo
ENGINEERS began a sprint today to restore Sarajevo's gas and
electricity before a ceasefire deadline as Bosnian rivals fought for
territory that will give them bargaining power at peace talks.
The Muslim-led Bosnian Government has made the start of the ceasefire
on October 10 conditional on the restoration of the capital's utilities.
UN co-ordinator William Eagleton said the problems were more
''technical than political''. He said he expected gas supplies to reach
Sarajevo by Monday evening, just hours before the ceasefire takes
effect.
The prospect of a ceasefire, to be followed later this month by peace
talks between the warring sides in the United States, has spurred
optimism in Sarajevo and around the world that an end to the 3[1/2]-year
conflict is within grasp.
Richard Holbrooke, the US envoy who negotiated the agreement, cooled
expectations when he stressed the difficulties in reconciling the
enmities created by a war that has left thousands dead and hundreds of
thousands homeless.
Holbrooke said negotiators were ''very, very hopeful'', but cautioned:
''Let no-one think that peace is imminent or round the corner or that
peace talks will produce immediate result . . . the task ahead of us is
very daunting.''
Holbrooke was in Rome to brief representatives of the Big Power
Contact Group on former Yugoslavia -- Britain, the United States,
Russia, France, and Germany -- on the outcome of his shuttle diplomacy.
With five days' leeway before guns are laid down, all sides in the
conflict launched into a final round of battles for territory in
north-west Bosnia.
UN peacekeepers said Croatia had moved up to 400 troops into the
north-west Bihac area this week, possibly to shore up Bosnian government
forces under attack by the Bosnian Serb Army (BSA).
Serb media said the BSA recaptured the west Bosnian town of Kljuc, one
of the key gains made by allied Bosnian-Croat forces during an offensive
last month.
However Western military observers denied that Kljuc, 25 miles
south-east of Bihac, was in Serb hands. An EU team of monitors said the
town was ''definitely not taken by the Serbs'' and said the situation
was quiet.
People in Sarajevo, who have suffered almost 10,000 dead during a Serb
siege that began when the war broke out, were buoyed with hope,
apparently encouraged by determined American leadership of the peace
process.
The mood on the streets was optimistic, a contrast to the usual
cynicism that has greeted the efforts of international diplomacy.
''I don't think this means an end to the war, but I think that the
ceasefire could last for a long time while they're talking about
peace,'' retired nurse Mujesira Omerspahic said.
A young military policeman added: ''I am optimistic about this
ceasefire because the situation has suddenly shifted to our advantage.
Our army is stronger and we have got some support from Nato.''
Nato defence ministers met in the United States on plans to deploy an
international force to enforce an eventual peace settlement. The force
would replace UN peacekeepers.
It would be under Nato command but would include non-Alliance troops,
including Russians, if a command structure which includes Moscow can be
set up.
The Nato-led operation, including 25,000 American troops, would be the
largest ground operation ever conducted by the Alliance, whose two-week
campaign of air raids last month forced the Bosnian Serbs to remove
their siege guns from Sarajevo.
The Allies are adamant that their men will be under the sole command
of Nato, with no military role for the UN
However, at the same time, they want Russia and other non-Nato
countries to take part.
French Defence Minister Charles Millon said he had proposed that the
Russians could be given specific tasks which would not involve them
coming under the Nato command structure.
American Defence Secretary William Perry is to meet Russian defence
chief Pavel Grachev in Geneva on Sunday to try to agree on a formula for
Russian participation. Moscow does not want its forces being ordered
about by American generals.
UN peacekeepers, meanwhile, will stay in Bosnia for the moment to
oversee implementation of the ceasefire.
Spokesman Alexander Ivanko said the UN would set up a ''management
regime'' to deal with and contain violations.--Reuter.

INVESTIGATIONS were under way last night to discover the source of
about 200 phosphorous sticks washed up on the shores of Arran and
Ayrshire.
High tides and winds are likely to deposit more of the old munitions
during today.
Bomb disposal officers, Coastguards and firefighters were called in as
police alerted local people to avoid the beaches affected.
Devices were discovered on the Kildonan shoreline at Arran; West Bay,
Millport; South Beach, Saltcoats; and The Point, Stevenston.
This latest discovery has heightened fears over dumping of munitions
in the Firth of Clyde and the effect that drilling operations by British
Gas may be having on old dumping grounds.
Some of the sticks found at Kildonan beach, on the southern tip of
Arran, ignited before they could be recovered by police and coastguard
officers.
Mr Russell Cheshire, whose wife discovered some of the objects, said:
''There is very real local concern that these things could cause harm to
people, particularly children. I understand that they could cause
serious burns if touched. People here are most upset although some are
saying 'Oh no not again'. ''
Superintendent John Young said last night: ''The devices do not
present any danger to the public so long as they do not come into
physical contact with them.
''Anyone finding a device should leave it well alone and inform their
local police office.''
Senior police officers and army personnel were meeting to try to
identify the objects and determine how best to dispose of them. It is
assumed the sticks date from the Second World War, but the actual
dumping site is not yet known.
Earlier this week Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon
Valley, called for a full inquiry into claims that proper procedures had
not been adhered to in the dumping of munitions over a 20-year period in
the Beaufort's Dyke between Scotland and Northern Ireland.
He said last night: ''This once again raises the question of how safe
the dumping grounds are, especially with drilling and cable-laying
operations going on all the time.
''This is dramatic proof of the claims that have been made in recent
weeks about the safety of the dumping grounds and I am astonished at the
cavalier attitude of the Ministry of Defence over their responsibility
for dumping in the Firth of Clyde.''
Mr Foulkes will contact British Gas to urge it to suspend test
drilling off the Galloway coast until it is established that there is no
link between that and yesterday's discoveries.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ''We are waiting for
reports on the latest finds which are being dealt with by the police,
coastguard and military personnel.
''Discoveries of this kind in the past on the shores of Northern
Ireland and Western Scotland have been closely examined by our
laboratories and independent experts and found to have had no link with
the military forces of the United Kingdom or indeed any UK company.
''It should be pointed out that munitions dumping in the areas
allocated is not restricted to the Ministry of Defence or British
companies and is allowed under licence to other countries. These
licences are strictly controlled by the relevant Government
department.''
He added: ''We will be closely monitoring the discoveries made around
the Firth of Clyde.''
Clyde Coastguard spokesman Mr Roger Clark said that the objects were
being examined and made safe and that it was likely that they came from
old dumping grounds.

A DELEGATION from the Scottish TUC will meet Labour's Shadow Scots
Secretary George Robertson on Monday to try to settle differences over
the future make-up of a Scottish Parliament.
Some STUC members are angry that Labour leader Tony Blair has accused
them of being immature in not accepting Labour's proposals.
The trade union body had wanted a future parliament to have more MPs
than the 129 Labour is proposing.
If Mr Robertson can convince the STUC leaders that Labour will
guarantee as much gender balance and proportional representation as
possible, then the trade unionists may reluctantly fall in with Labour.

NORTHSOUND Radio has asked the Office of Fair Trading to intervene in
a bid to be able to broadcast live reports of football matches involving
Aberdeen, whom they sponsor to the tune of #100,000 a year.
The Aberdeen-based station was able to broadcast Dons matches until
the beginning of this season -- when an exclusive commercial radio deal
worth #155,000 a year was struck between Scot FM and the Scottish
Football League.
The BBC has a separate non-commercial radio contract also covering all
Scotland.
Scot FM does not broadcast in the Aberdeen area and Northsound
managing director Mr John Martin claimed yesterday it was a breach of
natural justice for a station to have exclusive rights within an area
where it did not have the legal right to broadcast.
He said that Northsound had offered #50,000 over three years for the
right to broadcast Aberdeen games, but the Scottish League had said they
could not negotiate a deal without the sanction of Scot FM.
Northsound has been backed by Aberdeen FC chairman Mr Ian Donald, who
said: ''We would have loved to be in a position to agree to all of
Aberdeen's games being broadcast in the north-east.''
Their arguments were rejected by Mr Ken McRobb, of Scot FM, who said
his station had moved in when Radio Clyde, negotiating on behalf of
Scottish Radio Holdings (Clyde, Forth, Tay and Northsound) had pulled
out of negotiations with the league without agreeing a deal.
Scot FM had paid a handsome premium over and above the straightforward
contract price to ensure exclusivity for the two-year deal, with a
two-year option.
''Northsound, through their parent company, had an opportunity to
strike a deal, but blew their opportunity,'' said Mr McRobb.
Mr Bill Wilson, commercial director of the SFA and the Scottish
Football League, said last night that it had not been a bidding
situation and that the league management committee, which includes
Aberdeen chairman Mr Donald, had accepted the bid from Scot FM because
it was the only one on the table.
He said that Radio Clyde, which negotiates on behalf of Northsound,
had indicated it did not want match commentary and the league was not
interested in a non-commentary contract. On that basis a contract was
going to be agreed with only the BBC and no commercial station when
''out of the blue'' Scot FM contacted Mr Wilson and asked if they could
buy the contract exclusively.
''It was only when they had bought the contract that Clyde then said:
'We can't have the contract but we don't want anyone else to have it.'''
He added: ''If Northsound have a problem it is with Radio Clyde, not
with Scot FM or the Scottish Football League.''

A STINGING attack on councils which have turned their backs on the
pilot scheme for the Government's voucher scheme for pre-school
education was launched yesterday by Scottish Education Minister Raymond
Robertson.
The councils were putting dogma before the interests of children and
parents, he said.
At least eight councils had expressed an interest to date in taking
part in the pilot, more than enough to guarantee a meaningful scheme,
said Mr Robertson.
Turning to the similar number of councils that had decided to ignore
the pilot, the Minister said: ''Every parent of a pre-school child
should know that next year they will have lost the opportunity to get a
voucher for #1100 to use on pre-school education of their choice because
of this decision, and they should be asking their councils to explain
why.''
Mr Robertson also chose to run the risk of provoking accusations of
promoting the politics of envy from his party's opponents when he went
much further than Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who had described
the existing pre-five arrangements as favouring some parents at the
expense of others.
In what will be interpreted as an attack on the vulnerable, Mr
Robertson said: ''The benefits of the new voucher arrangements are
clear.
''No longer will parents be obliged to place their children where the
council wants them to go. No longer will families take second place to
single parents.
''Our proposals are designed to give all parents in an area the same
opportunities and the same choice of providers, so that they can choose
what is best for their child.''
The Government wants councils, the private nursery sector and
voluntary playgroups to compete for parents' vouchers, but the
initiative's many critics argue that the pre-five expertise built up by
local authorities should not be exposed to the vagaries of the market.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said the reaction of
councils opposed to the pilot came not from political dogma, but a
belief that the service should be properly run.

EDINBURGH last night announced plans for a major display of authentic
pirate treasure which the city fathers believe could bring in #5m worth
of tourism business to the local economy.
The Quest For A Pirate exhibition, which will cost #600,000 to stage,
will run in the City Art Centre from next February for four months.
It is based around the discovery by American Barry Clifford of the
booty from pirate prince Black Bellamy's treasure-laden galleon, the
Whydah, which sank off the coast of Massachusetts more than 250 years
ago.
Mr Clifford, who spent six years excavating the wreck, said a vast
array of items from the 100ft three-masted vessel will be flown to
Scotland from the US for display.
In total, more than 7310 individual pieces of coins, gold bars,
jewellery, weapons and the ships's bell, were all found during recovery
work carried out in the summer of 1985.
Mr Clifford said Edinburgh, the city of Robert Louis Stevenson whose
writing inspired his search for the ship, was the perfect setting for
the first showing anywhere in the world of the complete range of
artefacts.
Mr Herbert Coutts, head of museums and galleries in Edinburgh, said he
expected the exhibition could bring in up to #5m to the local economy, a
similar sum raised by the successful Star Trek display earlier this
year.

THE son of Sir David Steel yesterday admitted cultivating cannabis
with a value of up to #30,000 at his country cottage.
Graeme Steel, 29, felt that, because of his father's high public
profile, it would have been too risky to buy the drug on the street from
dealers, the High Court in Edinburgh was told.
Steel admitted producing cannabis between April 1993 and October last
year at the 200-year-old cottage at Mitchelson Farm, Stow, near
Galashiels, where he lives with his girlfriend, Lynne Turnbull, 28. Miss
Turnbull faced the same charge, but walked free when the Crown accepted
her plea of not guilty.
Mr Craig Scott, prosecuting, told the court that Steel had previous
convictions for minor offences, but none involving drugs.
He pretended to a local farmer that he had planted tomatoes in a rough
shelter made out of plastic sheeting. But, when police raided the
cottage after a tip-off, they discovered 40 cannabis plants with a
potential value of up to #30,000. They also found four pipes used for
smoking cannabis and booklets describing how to grow the drug.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel, said that Steel and his girlfriend had
led a self-sufficient lifestyle, growing vegetables and breeding
pedigree dogs.
He explained that his client had grown the cannabis for his own use
and it would have provided him with a year's supply.
In the past, alcohol had got him into trouble and he felt that
cannabis was a safer drug for him to use.
Steel had written articles and spoken on radio in support of the
decriminalisation of cannabis resin and had not seen himself as a danger
to society by growing the plants.
0 Mr Ogg added: ''He was very conscious that, due to the very high
public profile his father has in politics, any attempt to buy cannabis
on the streets would very obvious.
''It would reflect very badly on his father. He wishes to avoid the
criminality associated with the purchasing of drugs.
''He does recognise the foolishness of what he has done, and is deeply
aware of the distress he has caused other members of his family.''
Lord Cameron called for background reports, and deferred sentence
until October 27.

THE second hoax letter bomb in two weeks has been sent to the Scottish
Labour Party
headquarters in Glasgow, rekindling some of the political acrimony
surrounding the first incident.
The latest suspicious package arrived at Keir Hardie House in Lynedoch
Place at 9.15am yesterday. Police alerted the bomb squad, which found
the device to be an ''elaborate hoax''. The building was not evacuated
and there was no disruption to business.
The previous hoax bomb arrived at the same offices two weeks ago
today, coinciding with the last day of the SNP conference. The padded
envelope contained a death threat to Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson, pieces of metal and cuttings from SNP leaflets.
The SNP claimed Labour leaders had maximised publicity over the scare
as part of running smear campaign linking the Nationalists with terror
tactics and called for Mr Robertson's resignation.
Labour defended its actions but the row intensified when it emerged
that Scottish General Secretary Mr Jack McConnell found the package
almost four hours before he alerted police.
A Strathclyde police spokesman said last night they were investigating
links between the two incidents as one of many lines of inquiry. It is
understood the envelopes were similar in both cases.
Mr McConnell said he had been asked by police not to comment on the
contents or nature of the package. But he hit out at at the ''cheap
politics'' of the SNP for not taking the previous scare seriously.
Mr McConnell said: ''This is obviously part of an ongoing campaign and
everyone in Scotland has got to join together to stop it. Some people
had tried to make political capital out of the last situation and I hope
they regret that.''

A DRUGS purge by Strathclyde police has netted heroin worth more than
#1m in a series of raids on Glasgow's northern perimeter.
This brings the seizure total to more than #2.5m since the beginning
of the campaign, Operation Eagle.
However, police officers are facing the frustration of having to
arrest and charge the same suspects over and over again.
More than 3000 people have been questioned so far, but the majority
who have been charged have immediately returned to the streets on bail.
The intensified attack on the dealers has meant the option of a
tactical ''holiday'' by criminals is no longer an option, a senior
officer told The Herald.
Operation Eagle, which is set to have a major impact on overall crime
figures, is proving so successful it is unlikely to be abandoned at the
end of the current 90-day enforcement phase.
Eighteen people were arrested overnight on Thursday after raids in
Glasgow, Lanarkshire, and Paisley.
One concerted operation in Hamilton, Muirhead, and Lenzie led to the
arrests of four men, two aged 25, one 48, and one 53, and a woman aged
32.
The drugs seized included several kilos of high-quality heroin, later
valued at more than #1m. The haul also included #20,000 in cash.
The intelligence-based operation was generated in Strathclyde but led
to Liverpool and back to Lanarkshire.
Superintendent Alastair McNaughton, who heads Operation Eagle,
described the night of raids as the most intensive since the campaign
began.
''It brought marvellous results which underline to the traffickers and
dealers that we mean business. There are many more similar operations to
come,'' he said.
Five further raids on Thursday night netted more than #109,000 worth
of drugs.
In Glasgow's west end a man and woman were arrested and a kilo of
cannabis seized along with an imitation firearm and #1500.
In Possil a man and two women were arrested after a house raid and
heroin, amphetamine sulphate, and Temazepam capsules with a total value
in excess of #40,000 taken.
In another raid, this time in Nitshill in Glasgow, heroin,
amphetamine, and cannabis were seized with a street value of more than
#50,000 and a man and woman arrested.
Two men and two women were arrested in Harthill, Lanarkshire, and more
than 700 ecstasy tablets with a street value of #14,000 recovered.
In Paisley a 24-year-old man and a woman of the same age were arrested
and more than 100 Temazepam capsules and cannabis recovered.

JOHN Prescott's mother, it is safe to assume, warned him never to play
with his food. Yesterday he did, and ended up with pork pie on his face.
What works on the conference platform seldom works in a crowded press
room full of journalists hungry for a chance to knock the filling out of
a succesful politician.
We know Mrs Prescott is a stickler for propriety, because her son told
us so. In his speech, he described Michael Heseltine as the Kama Sutra
of the Conservative Party: 'He's been in every position. Except Number
10.'
All Herald readers need to know is that the Kama Sutra is an ancient,
illustrated sex manual. But for Mrs P that might have been a bit much,
so her John felt obliged to add ''Sorry Mum,'' explaining to delegates:
'You don't know my mother.'
The pork pie followed. This popular, working class delicacy is also
cockney rhyming slang for lie, and has been adopted by New Labour as a
campaign theme in its determination to beat the Tories at their own
game.
What Labour claims are the Government's porky pies have begun to
appear on billboards around the country.
Yesterday's target was the Daily Express, one of the only newspapers
still slavishly loyal to Mr Major. Brandishing its front page story,
which claimed he was angry at being passed up for a television
interview, Mr Prescott told a cheering conference: 'It's fiction,
invention, or, to put it in its simplest form, Tory lies. There's lies,
damn lies, and the Daily Express.'
As a result, the story had earned Express political editor Jon Craig
the first Labour pork pie award, which was duly brought forward, large
and perfectly baked, on a silver platter.
Mr Craig, unsurprisingly, was not on hand to receive it, but how the
delegates roared with laughter. Nothing goes down better than a properly
dished-out stunt.
An hour later it all went terribly wrong. As reporters huddled around
their computer screens in the crowded conference press room, the doors
opened and in came Mr Prescott, cameras in tow and tray in hand, with
all the confidence of a former Cunard bar steward.
It should have been foolproof. Prescott marched up to the Express
corner to present the award. However,  he hadn't counted on the
unshakeable self-confidence of a Fleet Street hard-man. Refusing the
honour, Mr Craig turned to the cameras and announced the story was true.
Two MPs, friends of Mr Prescott's, had approached him the previous
night, with the deputy leader's approval, to plant the story. 'You say
one thing in public and another in private, John. We stand by our story
100%.'
By then, Mr Prescott's press minders were tugging frantically on his
sleeve and the party's director of communications, Joy Johnson, was
trying to bundle the cameras away. With journalists crowding around, Mr
Prescott stuck manfully to his line  'It's a lie,''  but the game was
lost. He retreated, in search of the nearest humble pie shop.
Instead of the deputy leader's triumphant speech, all reporters could
talk about were the pork pies, two of them, sitting proudly atop Jon
Craig's television set. They will be kept as trophies.

Conference verdict
JOHN Prescott called it the best conference he could ever remember.
Labour's leadership rejoiced in its first conference in living memory
without a defeat.
In five days in Brighton, New Labour and Tony Blair delivered a
performance so removed from the images of old, self-destructive Labour
that the fixers preparing next week's Tory conference in Blackpool must
be tearing their hair out in despair: no loony left, no embarrassments
for the leadership, no costly policy commitments, no ammunition.
Nothing, in fact, except an image of a united party at ease with
itself, emerged from a nightmare, and ready for battle.
Some of the credit must go to New Labour's ruthless stage-management,
which took a leaf out of the Tories' Stalinist handbook on running a
party congress to ensure that dissent, when expressed, was carefully
sanitised and strictly limited.
However, no amount of control can mask the fact that this is a party
transformed. A year's recruitment drive has produced 100,000 new
members, giving Labour more subscribers than the traditionally
member-strong Tories. This has percolated through to conference: 80% of
delegates this year were there for the first time, open-minded, eager,
and unsullied by conference traditions of angry rebellion.
If speakers in the debates were chosen carefully -- for every voice of
rebellion there were a dozen paraphrasing Blair's New Labour, New
Britain mantra of moderation -- the introduction of one member-one vote,
and the co-operation of the big trade unions, has limited the chances of
policy defeats for the leadership. Only on scrapping Trident did the
left come close to a pyrrhic victory, but not close enough.
Tony Blair's keynote speech on Tuesday answered his critics, who for
days beforehand had called on him to stop talking about why he wanted to
change Labour and start explaining how he planned to change Britain.
As expected, he stuck to his determination to make no cash
commitments. The only policy surprise was the announcement of a finessed
deal with BT that will install computer links in every school, hospital
and library in the country in exchange for changes in telecommunications
regulation. Cost: billions for BT, legislative time and no more for a
Labour government.
Instead, the leader spent an hour explaining his vision and for the
first time earned not just the respect but the love of the conference.
Since his election last year, Tony Blair has struggled against a
suspicion among the rank-and-file that, ultimately, he is not one of
them.
However, his passion convinced them otherwise. When he declared: ''I
love my party, but I hate seeing it in opposition'', everything he had
spent the past year trying to achieve suddenly made sense.
For the left, the conference was proof of its irreversible exile.
Arthur Scargill received only cursory applause, and threatened to
leave the party. Malcontents were lost in the sea of hands approving
motion after Blairite motion, with nary a card vote. Even Dennis
Skinner, arch-foe of fashionable change, conceded in the end that
Blair's speech had been a success.
The closest conference came to repeating the public warfare of the
eighties was in Wednesday's education debate. Even then, the world was
turned on its head. Roy Hattersley, once a hate figure for the left,
earned its standing ovation with his attack on Tony Blair's support for
opted-out schools.
His point about the importance of abolishing academic and social
selection was accepted by Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett.
However, his eleventh-hour betrayal was not, and it was with a roar that
the majority of conference endorsed Blunkett's contemptuous analysis of
Hattersley's years as deputy leader: ''Those who failed to come up with
solutions shouldn't turn on those who have.''
Conference is a claustrophobic place, cut off from the bracing gale of
the real world blowing along the Brighton sea-front. Passion and
optimism infiltrate the pores of even the most cynical, and it would be
easy to write that this is a party destined to sweep aside the Tories in
its march to New Britain.
What cannot be gainsaid is the unshakeable confidence that has gripped
every party member. Not confidence of victory but confidence in New
Labour's ability as a party to unify in pursuit of its ambition. That
was not true six months ago when Clause 4 had to be killed off. It is
now, and in that Mr Major should be afraid.

LABOUR is ready for government and united in its determination to
defeat the Tories, deputy leader John Prescott said yesterday, on what
he declared was the first day of the General Election campaign.
In a rousing speech to conclude the party's annual conference, Mr
Prescott told cheering delegates Labour now spoke for the country.
''There are no safe Tory seats. We're on our way,'' he said.
A historic conference, marked by unprecedented unity of purpose and no
defeats for the leadership on policy, concluded in traditional style
with the singing of the Red Flag and Auld Lang Syne.
Mr Prescott warned against complacency and appealed to all voters to
back Labour next time.
He said that the General Election campaign had begun, and all had to
ask themselves the question: ''What can I do today to help get this
squalid, sleazy, sordid Government out?''
The recruitment campaign initiated last year had increased the party's
membership to 350,000, making it the fastest growing political party in
Europe.
His efforts, he said, would now focus on the party's Operation
Victory, a strategy aimed at winning the seats it has identified as
marginals crucial to a Labour majority.
Prime Minister John Major had had a ''nightmare year'', he said.
''Just compare the unity of Labour with that divided shambles called the
Tory Party.''
Humphrey the Downing Street cat, who disappeared for three months, had
run away to avoid the fighting between the Prime Minister and his
deputy, Mr Michael Heseltine, ''the first case of a cat leaving a
sinking ship''.
Labour would tackle unemployment and economic decline around the
country. ''We have to renew our regions. We have to learn from the
development agencies which Labour created for Scotland and Wales,'' he
said.
He repeated the party's commitment to reversing the privatisation of
the railways, although he did not depart from Mr Blair's avoidance of
the word ''nationalisation''.
''Let no one doubt that whatever happens to the railways in the next
18 months, and nobody is more committed to this than I am, a Labour
government will deliver on our commitment to a publicly owned,
publicly-accountable railway system.''
Labour's vision was of a united, equal, caring Britain. ''With every
day that passes under this dying, dishonest, discredited, disaster of a
Government, we are getting closer,'' he said.
''Closer to the day when Tony Blair forms a Labour government that
will create new Britain. Ready for government? Or course we're ready for
government. John Major stand aside. Go back to your constituency and
prepare for Opposition.''
* Labour Party officials are making ''unacceptable'' demands on BBC
news teams in a bid to increase their television coverage, the
corporation's director-general John Birt claimed last night.
He attacked as ''crass and inappropriate'' efforts which he says were
made by the party to influence the running order on BBC news programmes
on Tuesday, and emphasised the BBC's editorial independence.
A row broke out over a fax sent by press officer Alastair Campbell to
the BBC on Tuesday, asking the corporation not to allow its coverage of
Tony Blair's conference speech to be swamped by the OJ Simpson verdict.
Mr Campbell last night defended his fax, and said Mr Birt appeared to
be over-reacting. ''When you are told by a series of BBC personnel that
there is a real danger of a leader's speech being squeezed, then it is
entirely appropriate for us to raise this with people in authority at
the BBC,'' he said.

CHILDREN left fatherless by the Nimrod airshow crash in Canada are to
be paid through school and university by a trust fund set up in Toronto.
Their fathers died when the Nimrod they were demonstrating crashed
into Lake Ontario five weeks ago.
Flight Lieutenant Dom Gilbert, 31, left one child; his air electronics
officer Flight Lieutenant Bernie Worthington, 37, left two; and air
electronics operator Craig Barnett, 32, had a 17-month-old son and his
wife, Heather, is expecting their second baby.
For years RAF display teams have raised money for Canadian charities.
A Nimrod from RAF Kinloss, Morayshire, has travelled to Toronto for the
past 10 years and the crews raised more than #70,000 for three
childrens' hospitals there.
Organiser Susan Fraser, a Toronto businesswoman, said yesterday:
''They died doing something for us and now I think we should do
something for them.''
Donations to the Nimrod Fund are being taken at all branches of the
Canada Trust Bank across the Atlantic and already thousands of Canadian
dollars have been raised.
Squadron Leader Angus McPhee, of RAF Kinloss, said: ''This is an
overwhelming example of the support we have had from Toronto.''

THE Prince of Wales yesterday won a worldwide ban on a book about his
marriage by his former housekeeper at Highgrove House.
Mr Justice Potter at the High Court granted Prince Charles final
summary judgment against Mrs Wendy Berry over The Housekeeper's Diary,
which has already been published in America and Canada where it has sold
90,000 copies.
Mrs Berry, who worked for the royal family for nine years until 1993,
is already in breach of a temporary injunction imposed in January.
Yesterday's order prevents her from publishing ''anywhere in the
world'' any ''incident, conversation or information'' concerning any
member of the royal family or any guest or visitor which came to her
knowledge during her employment, or any incident, conversation, or
information relating to her employment.
It also demands delivery of all originals and copies of any ''diaries,
manuscripts, typescripts, books, or drafts of books'' containing such
material.
The Prince was also granted a declaration that Mrs Berry, of Lydiate
Park, Crosby, Liverpool, is liable to pay him all sums she has received
for her disclosures.
She must also give an account of the profits she has made from the
book and an article in an August edition of a New York magazine.
The Prince's counsel, Alexandra Marzec, said that the book constituted
a breach of Mrs Berry's contract of employment which contained a
worldwide confidentiality clause ''in perpetuity''.
She said there was ''no possible arguable defence'' to the Prince's
claim.
Mrs Berry, who is in her sixties, did not attend court and was not
represented. She is believed to be in Canada with her family.
The judge also ordered her to pay the Prince's costs of the action.

THE Torrie Collection, a valuable set of pictures, bronzes, and
marbles which has been in the care of Edinburgh University for more than
150 years, belongs to the public, a court ruled yesterday.
To protect the public interest, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh and the
Sheriff Principal of Lothian and Borders, are to be confirmed as
trustees alongside the university court.
A majority vote of the trustees will be required before any of the
works of art can be sold off.
Under a bequest by Sir James Erskine of Torrie in 1824 the university
became the custodian of the collection which includes Cain and Abel, a
late 16th century bronze by De Vries, and The Banks of a River, a 17th
century landscape by Jacob van Ruisdael.
In 1992, following an application to the Court of Session, the
university's court was established as the sole governing body of the
Torrie Trust, which administers the collection.
At that time the university was contemplating plans to raise up to
five million pounds by selling either the De Vries or the Van Ruisdael
and the sale had been approved in principle.
However, following the unopposed Court of Session application it
emerged that Edinburgh's Lord Provost, Mr Norman Irons, and the Sheriff
Principal of Lothian and Borders, Mr Gordon Nicholson, QC, might be
entitled to a voice in the collection's future.
According to Sir James's will, the Provost of the City and the Sheriff
of the County, and their successors, were to be ex-officio trustees of
the collection.
Mr William Nimmo Smith, QC for the university, told Lord Justice Clerk
Ross, sitting with Lords Morison and Cameron, that in 1992 the
university had applied to the court for the approval of a scheme to
administer the trust. This had been done in good faith in the belief
no-one else had a claim to act as trustees.
However, after the scheme had been approved in 1992, the university
discovered that a former Lord Provost and Sheriff Principal had been
involved in discussions about the collection as recently as the 1970s.
The problem throughout the history of the administration of the
collection was that Sir James had provided no financial resources for
its custody and maintenance. The burden of looking after it had fallen
on the university which thought it might have to sell a work to provide
funds for the collection's upkeep.
Mr Nimmo Smith said there were now no current plans to sell any of the
works and the two sides had returned to court in an amicable fashion to
clarify the legal position.
Giving a written decision in the case yesterday, Lord Ross said that
the university claimed that on a proper reading of the 1824 will, Sir
James had bequeathed the collection to it.
The university also argued that the Lord Provost and Sheriff Principal
had no continuing interest or duty as trustees. The Lord Provost and
Sheriff Principal argued Sir James's intention had been to create a
public trust with the public as beneficiaries.
Lord Ross said: ''What the truster (Sir James) was providing for was
that a trust should be created for a public purpose, that purpose being
'laying a foundation for a gallery for the encouragement of fine arts'.
''In our opinion it is plain that the public are the beneficiaries and
that the trust is accordingly a public trust.''

<TEXT>
A HEALTH board's general manager, who was involved in a recent dispute
with senior doctors, has gone off work amid a buzz of speculation.
Mr Derek Banks left his desk at Dumfries and Galloway Health Board's
headquarters on Tuesday in what has been described as ''a sudden
departure''.
It followed a visit to the Dumfries offices by Mr Mike Sibbald, human
resources manager for the NHS Executive in Scotland.
Board secretary Mr Les Callaghan said at first that Mr Banks was on
annual leave but would not elaborate. Later he issued a press statement
saying the general manager was on sick leave.
The release added that Mr Callaghan could be contacted for further
information but when he was called he replied: ''There is no further
information''.
Board chairperson Mrs Jean Tulloch said: ''I can assure you Mr Banks
is on sick leave. He has seen a doctor. That is all I can say.''
She confirmed that he had briefly attended a conference on NHS
management at the Moat House Hotel, Glasgow, on Thursday when she was
also present.
A board member, who asked not to be named, said: ''Mr Banks certainly
appeared to go off duty rather suddenly and unexpectedly. He was due to
submit a report at yesterday's health board meeting but was not present.
''This has led to speculation. Some of us think there is a possibility
he may be moving on but no-one really knows what is happening.''
A spokesman for the National Health Executive in Edinburgh confirmed
that Mr Sibbald had visited the board HQ.
Last month, Mr Banks, 47, was involved in a head-on controversy with
senior medical staff after a consultant paediatrican, Dr David Clow, was
dismissed by Dumfries and Galloway Community Health Trust for
''unacceptable personal conduct''. He is appealing on the grounds of
wrongful dismissal.
The board's chief administrative medical officer, Dr Ian MacLean,
alleged that Mr Banks had said, before the disciplinary hearing, that if
any board employee were to support Dr Clow against him it would be ''a
terminal career event''.
Dr MacLean made his allegations in a confidential internal memo but he
later said he stood by it in its entirety. When it was made public, Mr
Banks said: ''All I can say is that I refute that I made any threats to
any member of staff.''
Mr Banks' wife, Moira, 42, said yesterday: ''I have not seen him all
day. He is on leave. There is nothing more I can say.''

POLICE were last night searching for a thief who stole a car from an
Aberdeen filling station -- with a two-year-old girl strapped in the
back seat.
A distraught Rachel Forsyth was reunited with her parents about half
an hour later when the car was abandoned, with her still secure in her
child safety seat.
Grampian police believe the thief was unaware that Rachel was in the
back of the car when he stole it from a filling station forecourt, but
may have panicked when she started screaming.
The car was found less than a mile from the scene of the theft by a
police sergeant who was involved in a search of the area for the missing
girl.
Last night Mrs Allison Forsyth, 34, of Callum Wynd, Kingswells,
Aberdeen, described her horror as she saw her new metallic blue Honda
Civic car being stolen.
''The best way to get Rachel to have a sleep is to take her for a
drive,'' she said. ''I had been out with her and she had just woken up
and I drove into Dicksons, in Springfield Road, for some petrol.
''I had just filled up, and went up to the door and inside to pay. I
hadn't even paid when I turned round and saw the car moving away. I
couldn't believe it. It is a new car and I had to check the registration
to make sure it was mine.
''When I saw it was moving I just screamed: 'That's my car.' A couple
of guys ran after the car but they were just on foot and obviously
couldn't catch it and I shouted to the girl to dial 999.
''I don't know if it was a man or a woman, but the passenger door was
still locked when it was found, so it seems likely it was only one
person. I didn't really see.''
Mrs Forsyth, who works in the control room of Grampian Fire Brigade,
said she was absolutely devastated.
After the police had been called she phoned her husband, David, who
was at home and he immediately drove to join her while police started to
search.
The abandoned vehicle was found in the grounds of Kepplestone Halls, a
Robert Gordon University residence, less than a mile from the scene of
the crime.
''The two-year-old was screaming her head off and there is absolutely
nothing to suggest that the person who stole the car was aware she was
there when it was taken,'' a police spokesman said.
''It may be that he panicked when she started screaming and abandoned
the car.''
Mr Forsyth said that, because the petrol cap is opened by a switch,
the keys were still in the ignition which allowed the thief to make the
quick getaway -- with more than he bargained for.
''Rachel was quite traumatised for a good time afterwards,'' he said.
''She was in quite a state when we were reunited, but she is a bit
better now. We were still at the filling station when the car was found
and the police took us down to Kepplestone to meet her.''
Grampian police are appealing for anyone with any information to
contact them. In particular, they would like to speak to the driver of a
white diesel taxi which visited the garage at around 4.10pm when the
incident occurred.

A NEW-BORN baby seriously injured in a car crash in Wester Ross
yesterday has been flown by helicopter to Inverness for urgent medical
attention.
It is believed the infant was being taken home from hospital by her
parents just days after being born when they were involved in a head-on
crash on the A87 at Balmacara.
One person was killed and four adults and the infant were taken to
Skye's Broadford Hospital for treatment.
However, due to the seriousness of the baby's condition, a
paediatrician and an incubator were flown by RAF Sea King helicopter
from Inverness's Raigmore Hospital to take the child to Inverness for
specialist treatment.
Early reports say the baby was thrown from the vehicle during the
crash and was found by rescuers.

THE Government is failing to meet its own targets on cutting teenage
smoking, Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton admitted
yesterday.
Addressing a European conference in Edinburgh on tobacco use among the
young, he said the Government had set a target to cut smoking in the
12-24 age group by 30% between 1986 and 2000 and by 20% for those aged
25-65.
''I am pleased to say that we are making some progress in the older
age group. However, for younger people, the figures for 1992 are far
more gloomy and, disappointingly, indicate no change from 1986.
Lord James said the latest figures indicated 12% of pupils aged 12-15
were regular smokers in 1994, the same percentage as in 1986.
''A particular concern is our failure to make an impact on smoking
among girls'' he added.
Lord James said that the NHS alone spent at least #77m in Scotland on
treating smoking-related illnesses.
''Smoking remains one of the greatest barriers to improved health. In
Scotland alone, over 10,600 people die each year as a result of their
smoking. That amounts to one in six of all deaths,'' he said.
''Put starkly, smoking kills about five times more people than all
other avoidable deaths put together -- including road accidents, fires
and other accidents, suicide and murder, Aids and drug misuse.
''A spectrum of action is needed, including health education, fiscal
measures, controls on advertising and activity in schools. Price is one
of the most powerful levers available to us. Raising tobacco taxation is
an effective way of reducing consumption.''

* Children as young as eight with alcoholic parents are becoming
carers.
A conference for health, education and child care workers heard
yesterday how hundreds of children across Scotland were often taking on
basic household tasks and responsibilities where parents had drink
problems. Delegates heard how a survey revealed an estimated one in 10
adults had a drink problem, leaving a huge potential for youngsters
whose lives are affected.
During the seminar, jointly organised by the Health Education Board
for Scotland and the children's charity, Barnardo's Scotland, Mr Hugh
Mackintosh, director of Barnardo's Scotland, said: ''Clearly there is a
problem that needs addressing and this conference is hopefully the first
step in the right direction.''

SKYE will never be the same place again now the road bridge joins it
to the mainland. That feeling of detachment, of actually having to be
ferried across the water to an island, however short the crossing, has
gone forever.
By some it is lamented, by others a welcome march of progress. Derek
Cooper accepts change is inevitable: ''Skye is no longer the place it
was 10 years ago, and 10 years from now will no longer be the place it
is today,'' he says. ''The fight to keep the old Skye from changing is
now very much a rearguard action fought by a vociferous minority.''
Yet despite the continuous process of social and economic evolution,
Cooper recognises that some things are immutable, and that Skye is a
special place. ''Even a short exposure to this extraordinary island's
charm can produce a state of euphoria which has been diagnosed as
Skye-fever, a malaise which, if you are fortunate, is incurable.''
In this updated edition of his best-selling book, first published in
1970, Cooper attempts to anatomise the unique attraction of Skye's
430,000 acres.
How successfully he does so is debatable. As part guide, part
gazetteer, and part anthology, the book as rather too disjointed for my
liking. I would have preferred a more analytical approach from the
author's own perspective. especially since Cooper once lived on the
island.
As it is the book is principally a gazetteer, elaborating, among other
things, the origin of Skye place-names. You don't read a gazetteer in
the way you do a novel, you dip into it for information, when you have
something specific you want to know. In that sense, then, Skye is
something of a sham.
One of the more interesting sections is not Cooper's writing at all,
but that of others with Skye connections. The anthology at the end
brings together 40 extracts from writers, travellers, politicians,
mountaineers, poets, painters, and tourists, among them commentators
like Thomas Pennant, Boswell, Johnson and, of course, Walter Scott.
A potted history explains how the island's governmental and social
fabric changed radically after Culloden and the Jacobite defeat of 1746.
Before this, says Cooper, warring clan chiefs had ''disfigured the
Highlands in a pageant of horrific butchery that makes Elizabethan
revenge tragedy look like a drawing-room farce''.
Culloden led to the break-up of the clan system in a dampening down of
the fires of rebellion, and the extirpation of the Gaelic language, in a
similar process to that which occurred in Wales.
Ironically, both Welsh and Gaelic -- the former rather more
successfully -- have experienced a revival in recent years as the value
of cultural heritage among the Celtic nations reasserts itself and is
flaunted as a tourist attraction.
It is all part of the process of change. Economic change and the means
of earning a living on Skye, Cooper points out, have led to an exodus of
young people. ''Nowadays Skye can afford to employ only two lawyers, two
veterinary surgeons, two dentists, one chemist, one architect, and one
chartered accountant.'' Academic success is an almost certain ticket
out.
What can't be changed is the scenic beauty which provides Skye with
its unique appeal. ''Nowhere else in the whole of Britain is there so
much contrast in one small area. Its beauty will be here long after we
are gone, and long after we are gone the magic will remain.''
* Skye, by Derek Cooper (Birlinn, #8.99).

Outside, David Bowie (RCA)
* IT MAY be of relevance to note that, in addition to being promoted
via ads in music magazines and newspapers, this album is to be
advertised in two specialist journals. One of them is a London-based
modern art magazine, Mr Bowie having re-invented himself -- again -- as
a visual artist and arts commentator. More unusually, however, Outside
is to be sold via the pages of The Lancet, the trade paper for the
medical fraternity. Why The Lancet? Well, having listened to Mr Bowie's
cyber-splatter-novel concept album, with its Eno-derived surface
shadings and Mr Bowie's sub-operatic quaverinesses, I now know. It's
because GPs are generally kinder when it comes to dealing with sad old
jossers who are past it. Time to wake up and take your medicine NOW, Mr
Bowie.
The Great Rock Discography, M C Strong (Canongate Books, #20)
* GREATER! Rockier! More discographical! Stronger! Life-enhancing
grist to the mill of every rock obsessive. The second edition of the
Stakhanovite Mr Strong's comprehensive compendium provides a
near-complete answer to one of life's two ultimate questions: Which
tracks were on which album, on what label, when, and who played them?
But what, I hear you ask, is life's other ultimate question? Easy: why
did God make the sleepy Scottish hamlet of Falkirk? Answer: so that
heroic Bairn M C Strong could labour there without distraction.
Design of a Decade: The Best of Janet Jackson, Janet Jackson (A&amp;M)
* GLOSSY, glassy-eyed pop-funk artfully crafted by Ms Jackson's
sublime studio-overseers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, between 1986 and
1995. Close your eyes and don't think of Michael . . .
The Gold Experience, Squiggle or The Artist Formerly Known As Prince
(Warner Brothers/NPG)
* SURRENDER to the aural caress of Captain No-Name as he leads you on
a funky trip through the pelvic pump-rooms of his carnal domain. It's a
sexual-spiritual philosophipussical groove thang, y'all. So grease up,
pucker up, and get unbuttoned. Love ya ta death, your TAFKAPfulness.
Boss Hog, Boss Hog (Geffen)
* PRIMAL post-post-grunge punk rock fronted by strong wombyn Cristina
Martinez, with explosive bluesman Jon Spencer in the background. ''I dig
your groovy hair!'' cries Mr Spencer at one point. ''I dig your
barbecued lips!'' ripostes Ms Martinez. Yup, Boss Hog are an unravelled,
re-modelled version of the Cramps.
Peel Sessions, Can (Strange Fruit)
* AH YES, I remember Kraut-rock in the early seventies. Much loved by
spotty schoolboy swots in ill-fitting RAF greatcoats, it was. Despite
the fact that I was that swotty, spotty schoolboy, I hated Kraut-rock.
And here's proof that I was wrong. These sessions, four in all, were
recorded between 1973 and 1975. Can shimmy and pound like a locomotive;
ebb and flow like a volcano, and glow strangely in ways like you've
never seen. If you see me on the street in an over-large RAF greatcoat,
you'll know I'm catching up on lost time.
DAVID BELCHER
Yonder Tree, Gino Vannelli (Dreyfus)
* CANADIAN Vannelli has been making superior records for years without
troubling the shipping departments, let alone the charts. The 1978 album
Brother to Brother was somewhere between Stevie Wonder and Steely Dan;
this is jazzier, early Steps Ahead, say, backing a 1990s Bennett or
Sinatra, although Vannelli's vocal technique and expressive range go way
beyond mere crooning. The bodice-ripping Moon Over Madness apart,
Vannelli fans (all five of us) will love it; Van fans and Buckley buffs
might be persuaded; the rest should at least leave themselves open to
seduction.
By Heart, Maggie Holland (Rhiannon)
* SEASONED English folk club troubadour Holland disappointingly runs
the gamut of earnest protest, heavy humour, dreich traditional
favourites, and ill-advised covers of Michael Chapman and Tom Waits, all
sung to rather stolid arrangements with little of the titular heart.
Homecoming, Gateway (ECM)
* RECORDED evidence of the material from Gateway's magical Glasgow
International Jazz Festival concert last year has been a long time
coming but proves well worth the wait. Guitarist John Abercrombie,
bassist Dave Holland, and drummer and occasional Jarrettesque pianist
Jack DeJohnette are major league players whose work with and for each
other boldly energetic and softly oblique tunes alike is never less than
absorbing.
A Biography of the Rev Absalom Dawe, John Surman (ECM)
* SURMAN'S ''solo'' albums (he plays saxophones and clarinets over his
own shimmering keyboard accompaniments) continue to surprise and
delight. Returning to his beloved, fertile Hardy country (Dawe, Surman's
great great grandfather, was apparently the model for the shoemaker in
Under the Greenwood Tree), Surman evokes rustic charm, devotional music
and on Druid's Circle, with its belter of a baritone section riff, some
richly creative and carefree blowing.

THE 78th season of the Glasgow Chess League, gets under way this
month. Sponsored by Chess and Bridge Suppliers (Scotland), the League
consists of six divisions and some 70 teams. Standards are high in the
top divisions, but newcomers to the game and those who play purely for
fun also compete in the lower divisions. Last year's first division
champions, Glasgow Polytechnic, are one of a number of central Glasgow
clubs who field teams of all strengths.
You may be inspired by the current Anand-Kasparov match to try your
own hand at the game. Anyone interested in joining one of the 30 Glasgow
League clubs should contact the League Secretary, Sam Collins (01475
700350), who will put you in touch with a club near you. For information
about clubs elsewhere in Scotland, contact the Scottish Chess
Association Secretary, Frank Banaghan (0131 667 0852).

HALT: what do we have here? A not-so-little furry friend or something
quite decidedly faux? Do not be alarmed. No wonderful creature of the
wild or loveable pet has been recycled as the latest must-have handbag.
Every one is a fabulous forgery.
Unlikely and improbable fantasy furs are the major hit of the moment.
Designers have, of course, ventured in previous seasons on safari into
the acrylic game reserve, to capture those perennially popular big cats,
leopards and tigers. But this season, they have ventured little further
than the local pound with the hottest fur being dalmatian.
The fashion conscious will be spotted this winter in all the right
places as dalmatian print now comes in at least 101 ideas. The ultimate
in shopping trolleys heralds the return of highly-conspicuous
consumption, while Annalena's perfectly tailored two-piece must be the
required attire for any dog-day afternoon.
Blinded by all these spots? Try stripes but restrict the colour to
black and white. The random markings of zebra criss-cross a jaunty beret
from Miss Jones and weather-beating ankle boots from Pied a terre. For
only #7, House of Fraser's zebra scarf brings a cost-effective touch of
the wild to any tame city suit.
Or what about the splash markings of My Little Pony? A flap in phony
pony adds a note of charming whimsy to Russell &amp; Bromley's Kelly bag.
For every chilly day this winter, fashion has a cosy creature comfort.
So why not wrap up in your pet favourite?

* MY last good buy -- I'm actually still waiting for this. I ordered a
bread making machine for my wife as part of our wedding anniversary
present.
She had been saying, ''Oh I'd love to make my own bread but I'm sure
that all I'd do if I had one of those machines is eat, and eat, and eat,
and put on weight.''
So I thought that would be a great present and ordered it secretly for

Unfortunately, they spoilt the surprise by writing to her saying that
it wasn't ready yet, so we're still waiting on this little
microwave-sized machine arriving.

DETECTIVES said yesterday they had arrested five boys from a gang said
to be responsible for more than 400 crimes in the last six months.
Police earlier complained they were powerless to stop the seven-strong
gang continuing their crime spree in the centre of Mansfield,
Nottinghamshire.
The teenagers are all under 15 and so too young to be sent to young
offenders' institutions.
Police said they had arrested a 13-year-old boy in connection with the
theft of a cash till on Thursday, while three 14-year-olds were later
arrested by a police dog handler near the A614 outside Mansfield. They
were running from a stolen car.
The gang's 14-year-old ringleader was already in secure accommodation
after he was arrested for alleged burglary last week.
Officers are still looking for a 13-year-old boy, while the seventh
alleged member of the gang is not wanted for any offence.
The boys' solicitor, Mr Andrew Hollis, from Mansfield, admitted the
gang aged 13 and 14, were influencing other children in the town with
their life of crime.
Nottinghamshire police and social services have said there is little
they can do to stop the boys returning to the streets after their court
appearances.
Mr Hollis said: ''The trouble is these kids know the score. They are
streetwise enough to know that breaking into shops and stealing cars is
unlikely to attract the same harsher view that would follow
housebreaking.''

BRITAIN'S public sector is to compete against the world's best private
companies and government-run institutions in a drive to improve
efficiency, deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine announced last
night.
Civil servants and others employed in the government sector are to be
set targets based on the achievements of the world's most efficient.
The annual review of the executive agencies is to be turned into
''something more useful'', comparing their activities with others right
across government.
He also proposes more internal comparisons in government agency annual
reports.
''I want the public sector to benchmark its performance against the
best in the private sector and against high-quality public services in
other countries,'' he told the 50th anniversary dinner of the Henley
Management College in his constituency.
Mr Heseltine said public companies should learn from the benchmarking
activities practised by the best UK businesses -- comparing their
performances against the best in their field, and where necessary taking
action to improve things.
''Managers in the private sector have to be continuously active in
seeking out competitive advantage. They have to manage change; change in
products, in markets, in culture. So does the public sector -- which has
indeed been changing.''
He added: ''Where a public sector solution is the right one, we are
seeking to learn from the best possible practice in the private sector.
The challenge is to use objective measurements to identify those areas
in which the UK public service is world-class, and those where we must
learn and change.''

<RECORDNO>976011530</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LAW Society president Martin Mears yesterday launched an outspoken
attack on Thatcherism, the Conservative administration, and their impact
on society.
Mr Mears, addressing the solicitors' annual conference in Birmingham,
said it was time to refute ''the Government's lie that in the nation at
large, all is well, it's policies are working, and that our economy is
the envy of our neighbours.''
He insisted that if solicitors had seen their living standards fall in
recent years it was not because they were a little pocket of restrictive
practices and outmoded attitudes.
Lawyers were not the exception, but were typical. He insisted none of
the professions was in good heart.
Mr Mears said that it was middle managers who were the bedrock of the
Government's support in the eighties and they who had cheered loudest
when Arthur Scargill and the unions were ''seen off''.
He said: ''Now as they become the victims of company ''down-sizing''
and find themselves part of the permanently unemployed statistics, they
discover that it wasn't only Mr Scargill who was seen off. It was they,
the middle classes who were seen off.''
Mr Mears traced the middle classes' economic ills back to the days of
Thatcherism.
He said the notion that Thatcherism was a brutal creed, but one which
delivered, was exploded by economic statistics.
The average Briton now had a lower per capita income than his
counterpart in most Western European countries; the proportion of
national income taken in taxation was now greater than in 1979; and
persistent trade deficits were being run up.
Mr Mears attacked the Government plans to reform the divorce laws
south of the Border and restrict legal aid spending.
He described recent white and green papers outlining the Government's
plans as ''worthless pieces of dishonesty and humbug.''
He said that provisions of the divorce White Paper would largely ease
lawyers out of divorce work in favour of mediators.
Mr Mears also rounded on industrial tribunals, the Equal Opportunities
Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality.
He said most industrial tribunals worked effectively but cases in
which pregnant Servicewomen had been awarded large sums for dismissal,
and some other sex and race discrimination cases, had given the
impression that the tribunals were collaborating in a ''racket''.
Bodies which funded and encouraged ''these preposterous applications''
such as the EOC and the CRE had damaged their own credibility.
Mr Mears' comments on the EOC and CRE brought quick responses.
Kamlesh Bahl, chairwoman of the EOC and a member of the Law Society's
council, said: ''I think it's outrageous to be creating a picture which
is not substantiated by the statistics.''
Ms Bahl said fewer than 3% of cases before industrial tribunals
concern sex discrimination and fewer than 2% related to race
discrimination.
The CRE accused Mr Mears of adopting a ''totally negative approach''
which did not help good race relations, but would set back the cause.

A SCHOOLBOY'S dream of becoming the youngest person ever to address
the Conservatives' annual conference may be shattered by party
colleagues.
Justin Hinchcliffe, 14, had been chosen to represent Tottenham
Conservative Association at next week's gathering in Blackpool and was
hoping to make a speech.
However, fellow members of his London association have been incensed
by what they described as the schoolboy's right-wing comments.
Mr Philip Murphie, president of the association, said party members
were offended by Justin's remarks in a local newspaper in which he
suggested that St Ann's community hospital should be closed.
''He said the hospital was a waste of money and should be closed
because it was full of geriatrics. I've had about eight phone calls from
members, many of them elderly, who were very distressed about what he
said.
''I want to completely dissociate the association from the comments
Justin has made. People in all political parties have campaigned to keep
that hospital open.''
However, Justin later repeated his opinions, stressing they were his
personal views.
''It takes millions of pounds away from the Government each year and
very few people actually use the hospital and a majority of the patients
in the wards should be in nursing homes,'' he told BBC Radio 4's The
World At One.
Mr Murphie said: ''Unless he can give an understanding that he will
represent the views of the association and those of the party, it may
well be that we will ask Conservative Central Office to withdraw his
representative pass.''
Such a move would be a severe setback to Justin's ambition of
impressing the party faithful at conference and paving his way to
becoming a Tory MP, Cabinet minister, and even Prime Minister.
Mr Roger Smethurst, chairman of the Tottenham Constituency
Conservative Association, said party officers would be meeting over the
weekend.
Earlier yesterday, Justin told PA News: ''I'd like to be Prime
Minister but nobody hands you the keys to Downing Street. You have to
fight to get there. If I work hard enough, I'm sure I'll be there one
day.''

THE Scottish National Party last night complained to the BBC over a
radio programme which will today claim that taxpayers in England are
paying an extra 3p in the pound on income tax to subsidise the Scots and
the Welsh.
The SNP claimed that the Radio 4 programme, The Disunited Kingdom, was
''extraordinarily unbalanced''.
However, the BBC said the programme was not intended to be political
but was a ''personal essay'' by David Dimbleby.
Mr Dimbleby says: ''When it comes to the use of taxpayers' money it
certainly can't be said that Scotland gets a raw deal. On the contrary,
though the actual amounts can be disputed, there is general agreement
that Scotland does very well out of the United Kingdom and it is the
result of deliberate policy under all Governments for the past 30
years.''
Mr Mike Russell, chief executive of the SNP, said there had been no
request from the programme makers at any time for the SNP's own
budgetary information.
Mr Russell added: ''If there is to be a meaningful debate about the
economics of independence it should be tackled objectively by the BBC
and not without proper research and thought.''
A BBC spokeswoman in London said: ''We stand by all the statistics in
the context that the programme was made in.''

SURGEONS were last night battling to save the lives of two children
critically injured when a lorry carrying a skip overturned and crushed
their car -- killing a young mother and two other children.
The accident happened on a straight stretch of road as Mrs Susan
Prosser, 33, drove her eight-year-old daughter, Laura Medcroft, and two
school friends to the school at Cadmore End, near High Wycombe,
Buckinghamshire.
Divisional fire officer Ron Adams said: ''It would appear that they
collided head-on and the lorry took the vehicle backwards down an
embankment and into a tree. The car was crushed beneath the lorry.''
Mrs Prosser died at the scene of the crash in their home village of
Stokenchurch, Buckinghamshire, along with Laura and Nikita Somes, seven,
of Chinnor, Oxfordshire.
Fire officers using heavy lifting gear and cutting equipment freed her
18-month-old daughter, Rachael Medcroft, and another school child,
Nicholas Butler, eight, of High Wycombe, from the wreck of the Fiat Uno.
Both were taken to Wycombe General Hospital with multiple injuries,
including serious head wounds.
Rachael was last night being escorted by police to the Radcliffe
Infirmary in Oxford to undergo treatment at the hands of specialist
neurosurgeons at the paediatric intensive car unit. She was suffering
from severe head, chest and limb injuries.
The boy, who suffered head injuries and broken limbs, was undergoing
emergency surgery at Wycombe hospital.
Staff at Wycombe hospital administered a CT scan on both children to
check for brain damage.
Mrs Prosser lived with her two daughters, Laura and Rachael, in
Stokenchurch. Nikita, believed to be a friend of Laura, lived in
Chinnor, Oxfordshire, and Nicholas lives in Sands, High Wycombe, police
said.
Parents in the tiny villages around High Wycombe, who send their
children to the 85-pupil Cadmore End Church of England primary school,
were last night dealing with the shock.
Several children and their parents were crying as they left the little
school in the afternoon in the pouring rain.
Headteacher Mrs Sarah Hargreave said: ''Everyone at the school is
deeply shocked by this terrible tragedy and we shall do all we can to
help the families of those who were killed or injured.
''Staff have been telling children at the school something about what
has happened and a specialist in emotional trauma is standing by to help
them cope.
''We are very much a family at this village school. As in any family
we share things together and we will have an open assembly for parents
and pupils on Monday morning.''
Canon Tony Williamson, diocesan director of education for Oxford
Church of England Diocese, said: ''It's a delightful school and an
excellent school which I have known for a number of years and I am sure
they will come through these difficulties very well indeed.
''A tragedy like this is a very difficult thing to handle, but it's
part of life and it's part of education.''
Neighbours and friends described Mrs Prosser, who was separated from
her husband, as a ''wonderful mum''. One friend, who refused to be
named, wept as she said: ''She had a really big heart.''
The driver of the skip lorry, Mr Keith Hunt, of Stokenchurch, was
taken to Wycombe hospital suffering from shock, but was released later.

THE organisers of the Dunoon Jazz Festival, which will be staged next
weekend, have pulled off what should be one of the most swinging coups
of the Scottish festival circuit this year.
The pairing of clarinettist Buddy de Franco and vibist Terry Gibbs
will be more explosive than anything heard so far this year in the
country's various jazz bashes.
Both men came up with the bop era, and yet both remained heavily
influenced by the generation of swing musicians who had preceded them.
Hence, Gibbs, while adopting the harmonic ideas of the newer music as
played by Milt Jackson, in a time before Jackson joined the Modern Jazz
Quartet, swung in the exciting manner of Lionel Hampton.
And de Franco with a technical facility which, at times outstripped
even Benny Goodman, still drew heavily on the influences of Goodman
himself, Artie Shaw, and Johnny Mince.
Indeed in recent years the two have been together on several albums
which have had a decided mainstream feel about them with guitarist Herb
Ellis, bassist Milt Hinton, and drummer Butch Miles contributing to them
mightily.
Both men originally came to prominence during the final years of the
Big Bands. They both played with Tommy Dorsey while Gibbs also had
stints with Woody Herman and Goodman.
De Franco then became one of the few clarinet players to move into
bop.
De Franco did most to keep the clarinet alive as bop seemed ready to
overwhelm the instrument. He played with his own groups and with a small
Count Basie outfit when the legendary big band leader temporarily gave
up his sixteen-piece orchestra.
He also took part in that series of recordings which Norman Granz put
together featuring pianist Art Tatum locking horns, so to speak, with
other instrumental giants. There was the sublime meeting between Tatum
and alto saxophonist Benny Carter; the crackling combination with
trumpeter Roy Eldridge; the glorious date with tenorist Ben Webster and
the technical challenge between two masters of their instruments, Tatum
and de Franco.
It is surely one of the finest recordings the clarinettist has ever
made and years later he recalled the session vividly: ''I was sick that
day, but it wasn't an occasion I would have missed.''
It was Parker who turned de Franco into a be-bop clarinet player, into
the be-bop clarinet player and yet, he never did lose his swingtime
roots, possibly because that was where his own chosen horn reached its
finest flowering.
Even now he will tell you that Artie Shaw's recording of Stardust is
the benchmark for all jazz clarinettists.
That tribute to Shaw and his music gives you an idea of where de
Franco and Gibbs will be coming from this weekend. There may be a bit of
sparring -- a la Tatum-de Franco -- between the two main protagonists.
Those who catch them at Dunoon are liable to hear something very
special from two of the most exciting musicians still around.

Immortal Beloved (rental, cert 15)
* PSYCHOPATHIC punk rocker in Sid and Nancy; deeply dippy dope dealer
Drexl in True Romance; utterly barking cop in Leon; mad genius in
Immortal Beloved -- is there no end to Gary Oldman's versatility?
At first, Couch Potato must admit, the thought of Oldman playing the
mighty Ludwig van Beethoven sounded like a casting as unlikely as
picking John Wayne to play Oscar Wilde, but seeing turned out to be
believing. Oldman's is a brilliant if distinctly unrestrained
performance in a high-class art biopic of the old Hollywood school. We
sat down prepared for laughter or boredom, but ended up being stirred,
shaken, wrung out, and hung out to dry like a dishcloth by the sheer
emotional histrionics of it all.
Although the film has plenty of light and shade, the frequent climaxes
are as romantic and impassioned as Beethoven himself.
The storyline -- Beethoven's friend Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe)
tries to find the identity of Beethoven's heir, named in his will only
as his ''Immortal Beloved'' -- is not so much the reason for the film as
a device to give the story of Beethoven's life, music, and many loves
(here including Johanna Ter Stegge, Valeria Golino, and Isabella
Rossellini) some narrative shape, so the mystery itself hardly matters.
What does matter is the magnificent music, the stunning visual style
(all deep focus, pale colours, and a candlelight glow), and Oldman's
heartrending bravura performance.
If you're prepared to follow Immortal Beloved over the top you'll be
in for a heck of a ride.
Crumb (rental, cert 18)
* IN almost six years of reviewing vids for this paper, Couch Potato
has never covered anything so uncompromisingly uncommercial, so queasy,
or so sad as Terry Zwigoff's low-budget documentary profile of Robert
Crumb, the San Francisco underground cartoonist and comic artist best
known for his 1960s creations Mr Natural, Fritz the Cat, and the cover
of Janis Joplin's first LP.
Among other things it's a disturbing anatomy of family madness in
which Robert Crumb, bizarrely eccentric as he is, looks like Mr Normal
beside his wretched brothers. But it's also an eye-opening critique of
Crumb's blackly misanthropic art, which can best be described as what
might have happened if Breueghel had got a job with Walt Disney and
Jonathan Swift had scripted a comic strip. All the hippies (whom Crumb
hated) who used to read him thought he was really hip and funny, which
tells you a lot about the Love Generation.
Les Yeux Sans Visage (Eyes Without A Face) (retail, Connoisseur, cert
18, #15.99)
* GEORGES Franju's chilling 1959 twist on the Frankenstein theme has
gained an unfair reputation as a horror shocker, mainly due to its
American release title of The Horror Chamber of Dr Faustus, but in fact
it's the most lyrical, fairytale-like chiller in the movies since the
1932 Frankenstein itself. Out of the B-horror mad-scientist plot about a
doctor who takes nefarious means to restore the beauty of his daughter,
disfigured in a car crash, Franju creates a grim but tender poem about
the triumph of innocence over cruelty; the final scene is one of the
most hauntingly beautiful in all cinema.

Jim Hewitson recalls a time when resistance to union with England left
protesters with an empty feeling
ONCE again as our politicians get down to some serious autumn partying
and media pundits slug it out over proposals for an Edinburgh assembly,
it's worth remembering that it was this week in 1706 when the last
Scottish Parliament met to vote itself out of business.
Early on in negotiations for a coming-together between Scotland and
England the Scottish people had been supportive of the idea. Practical
as ever, they saw the opportunity to get a share in England's great
trading empire. However, when it was learned that a federal union had
been rejected out of hand by England and that an incorporation or total
union was all they would consider, the mood changed dramatically.
National identity was threatened, of course, but of much more
practical concern to the punter, the man in the street, was that they
would face an additional taxation on an unprecedented scale liable to
render essentials like malt (for their beer) and salt (for their dinner)
prohibitively expensive. Even the shopkeepers of Edinburgh were ready to
riot, we are told, at the prospect of the Scottish Parliament calling it
a day and their best customers evaporating.
In this highly-charged political atmosphere, the Jacobites had been
busy and for probably the first time in Scotland's long history a shower
of pamphlets and broadsheets deluged the country in a propaganda
campaign denouncing the planned union and warning of the certain
miseries to follow.
However, one of the strangest attempts to stir up dissension came with
the demand, at the start of the last Scottish Parliament, that there
should be a national fast, ostensibly to seek divine guidance for the
Estates in their deliberations over the union. In fact, opponents of the
union hoped that it would provide a forum for a wave of national
protest. And if it involved a bit of rioting, all to the good.
The proposal was passed to the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland, who were in session, and their initial reaction was a
disappointment for the schemers. OK, they did announce a fast, on
October 17, but declined to appoint a national event, merely inviting
dignitaries to join them in the High Church in Edinburgh to share in the
religious services normal on such serious occasions. According to one
historian, and to the dismay of the anti-union lobby, instead of rioting
the day passed with ''Sabbath-like stillness and decorum''.
Undaunted, the plotters pressed on with their demands for a national
fast. Again the commissioners were canny. They agreed to a presbyterial
fast a few days later, and this time it was hoped that the clergy would
denounce the union proposals from the pulpit and excite the Scots at
large to insurrection. It didn't happen.
The ministers in their parishes stuck to the Assembly script and,
stressing the religious nature of the fast day, prayed in the very words
of the Commission's instructions: ''That all the determinations of the
Estates of Parliament, with respect to a union with England, might be
influenced and directed by divine wisdom, to the glory of God, the good
of religion, and particularly the Church of Scotland.''
After this, the rumour-machine turned its attention to more secular
matters. The day after the presbyterial fast, talk was of an attack on
the Parliament building and an attempt to seize the Honours of Scotland,
the crown jewels.

William Donaldson Clark believed that photography was essentially an
artistic activity. Julie Lawson considers the results of his enthusiasm
WILLIAM DONALDSON CLARK first became interested in photography when he
was living in the north of England where, in the 1840s and fifties, he
ran a successful calico printing works. In the early 1860s, Clark was
wealthy enough to give up business and returned to Scotland. He had been
born in Ayr, but chose to settle in Edinburgh where he ''gathered around
him a circle of friends interested in art and photography''. This circle
included the pioneer photographer and Royal Scottish Academician David
Octavius Hill, and the painters Sir George Harvey, Sam Bough, and his
closest friend and artistic mentor, Horatio McCulloch.
Clark's background in the theoretical science of chemistry and the
practical business of textile printing industry was useful preparation
for the complexities of darkroom photography. Considerable patience and
skill were required to obtain the prints from glass negatives that so
impressed Clark's contemporaries. Although Clark's background was
scientific and technical, he was a champion of the argument that
photography was essentially an artistic rather than a scientific
activity. Most of Clark's surviving photographs are topographical and
architectural.
In 1866, he made a photographic record of Melrose Abbey. This
photographic survey was undertaken in the spirit of John Ruskin's Seven
Lamps of Architecture, in which the critic had urged the photographing
of architecture ''stone by stone, and sculpture by sculpture, seizing
every opportunity afforded by scaffolding to approach it closely''.
Clark had obtained permission from the Duke of Buccleuch to erect
scaffolding on the abbey in order to do just that.
Clark was praised by his contemporaries for his landscape photography
above all else, but virtually none of this has, as yet, come to light.
Of his surviving work, the views of Edinburgh impress the most. They are
a combination of antiquarianism, an interest in the monuments for their
own sake, and a response to the changing aspects of the city.
His view of Princes Street of about 1860, for example, shows the
different architectural styles that had arisen side by side in the
previous two decades. Clark is interested in the juxtaposition of two
opposing styles, the gothic of George Meikle Kemp's monument to Sir
Walter Scott, and the classicism of William Henry Playfair's Royal
Scottish Academy. These two styles embody different social and aesthetic
values. The photograph reminds us of the way we have learned to
accommodate them both and to evade the contradictions they contain.
The realisation on the part of a few early photographers that the
camera was not bound by the rules and conventions of traditional
picture-making was the great breakthrough for photography. The
understanding that the canonical and conventional mode of vision could
be challenged -- that to deviate from it was, in fact, the great virtue
and strength of photography -- was beginning to dawn in works like those
of Clark. In particular, the buildings at the foot of the Mound in
Edinburgh were presented by him with a starkness and indifference to the
disciplines of ''the picturesque'' that seem distinctly photographic.
* Some of William Donaldson Clark's photographs are on view in the
exhibition Light From the Dark Room, at the Royal Scottish Academy,
Edinburgh, until October 15.
* Julie Lawson is Assistant Curator of Photography, Scottish National
Portrait Gallery.

Michael Fry sees the Edinburgh garrison unleash its wrath on the city
below and considers the implications both for the citzenry and the wider
campaign
EDINBURGH, October 7 -- Six days of terror in the city ended yesterday
with a ceasefire in the bombardment from the castle, after Prince
Charles Edward Stuart lifted his blockade on the Government's garrison
holding out there.
In the past week 23 people, including seven civilians, have been
killed by cannonballs or shot, and many more wounded. Several buildings
on Castlehill have been burned out. One of the city's modern sights, the
splendid hexagonal house built by the poet, Allan Ramsay, is damaged.
Two of the main centres of business, the Lawnmarket and the Grassmarket,
were deserted by the panic-stricken citizens.
The firing broke out on October 1 despite a truce between the
Jacobites and commanders of the castle, General Joshua Guest and General
George Preston. These had threatened retaliation if their supplies were
cut off, and it was agreed that no further action against them would be
taken while they sought instructions from London.
The truce collapsed after Highlanders manning a sentry post at the
weighhouse, in front of the castle's main gateway, inspected a cask of
butter being sent in. Inside they found a smuggled letter from the
captain of one of the Royal Navy's frigates now in the Firth of Forth.
The sentries fired warning shots to stop a party of people carrying the
rest of a consignment of provisions across no man's land.
The castle's guns at once responded, wounding several clansmen and a
servant girl. They continued to fire at intervals, deliberately
targeting nearby houses where Jacobites had taken shelter, and sending
volleys down the length of the High Street.
The next day, Prince Charles issued a proclamation forbidding all
communication between the town and the castle on pain of death. Even so,
on October 3 his secretary, John Murray of Broughton, sent up to the
castle a delegation of directors from the Royal Bank of Scotland, led by
the chief cashier, John Campbell. Under a white flag, they were to
collect the reserves they had deposited there just before the Jacobite
occupation of the city. Though General Guest was unaware of the fact,
these gold sovereigns were to be paid out in exchange for large
quantities of notes gathered by the prince's army, including those
requisitioned in Glasgow, and presented to the bank.
The same day, the castle's cannons continued firing for six hours on
Livingston's Yards, a farm in the open fields near St Cuthbert's Church
to the west. It was held by a party of Jacobites from the city, under
the command of a shoemaker, Robert Taylor. Their assignment was to stop
supplies being hoisted to the beleaguered garrison up the steep cliffs
of Castle Rock.
These inexperienced volunteers fell easy prey to a soldier, Corporal
George Watson, who was let down unnoticed on a rope. He surprised and
killed several Jacobites single-handedly, set an outhouse on fire, then
scaled the cliffs again carrying rifles he had seized, cheered on by the
garrison. To finish the job a sally was then formed which burned down
the farm and killed more Jacobites, bringing Taylor and the others back
as prisoners.
On October 4, the bombardment went on through most of the day and
night, concentrated at the head of the High Street. There were more
deaths. Donald Cameron of Lochiel, the Jacobite Governor of Edinburgh,
was slightly wounded in the shoulder by splinters of stone while
directing the return fire of his soldiers from Castlehill. One house was
burned to the ground, and as far down as James Court others, including
Ramsay's, were damaged. The firing completely cleared the streets.
The Jacobites, lacking siege-guns, had no reply to the onslaught from
the castle. On October 5, with little sign of a halt to the city's
ordeal, Charles decided to lift the blockade.
This must count as a Jacobite defeat, but the bombardment has made the
loyal generals, and to that extent the cause of King George II,
extremely unpopular in Edinburgh. The risk may still be worth it if they
can stop the Highland army marching south, which the prince wishes to do
as soon as possible. If he were to prompt a rising by the English
Jacobites, he might be rewarded with a French invasion across the
Channel, in a two-pronged attack which could spell the end of the reign
of the House of Hanover in Great Britain.
That is why, according to some reports, General Preston has an
elaborate plan of disinformation to give the prince and his advisers a
false impression that the castle's supplies are running low and that
surrender could be imminent. So long as that seems plausible, the
Highland army may stay in Edinburgh.
Meanwhile its strength is building up again after the large desertions
which followed its victory at Prestonpans. One of the commanders, Lord
Elcho, comments that ''a great many people of fashion have joined the
army''.
From the North-east of Scotland, Lord Ogilvy and John Gordon of
Glenbucket have each brought in 300 clansmen. From the Braes of
Balquhidder, 100 more MacGregors have arrived. A regiment of 300
clansmen from Badenoch has come under the command of Ewan MacPherson of
Cluny, who holds a commission in the king's army but was captured by the
Jacobites on their way south and promised to join them. The clan of
another royal officer, Aeneas Mackintosh of Mackintosh, has been raised
by his wife, Lady Anne. There are reinforcements of Camerons and
MacDonalds from the Great Glen. Mackinnon of Mackinnon has brought 120
from Skye, but the other two chieftains on the island, Sir Alexander
Macdonald of Sleat and Norman Macleod of Macleod, have yet to respond to
appeals for support from the prince.
Lord Lovat, chief of the Frasers, has not committed himself, though
his eldest son is reported to be raising soldiers for the prince on
their lands beyond Inverness.
Sources close to Prince Charles say he will invade England once he has
5000 men.

Dear Messrs Patten and Howard,
We've had a very profitable summer here on Papa Westray. Thanks for
asking. Sorry to learn, however, that you two are currently not seeing
eye to eye over Hong Kong, but your difference of opinion set me
thinking that perhaps we're being a trifle cagey and restrained in our
efforts to develop our island's mini-economy. If we're determined to
enter the race for commercial success in a serious way then let's not be
half-hearted or shilly-shallying.
Firstly, I'd better give you a few facts about Papa Westray (Papay to
the locals). It covers some six square miles, has a population of around
70 and lies at the northernmost fringe of the Orkney group.
Now, our Commonwealth compatriots in Hong Kong, or at least a sizeable
number of the 3,200,000 British passport holders will, we're told, be
looking for a new home around the time of the 1997 handover to China.
Correct me if I'm wrong, Home Secretary, but the Government is set on
shutting the door on all but a select few of these folk, 50,000 if I
recall correctly.
A few years back when this problem first came to light the Adam Smith
Institute, the occasionally over-imaginative right-wing think tank,
suggested that the West Highlands could be the location of a new city
for these refugees. But I believe they're not equipped to absorb alien
culture in the way Orcadians have done for centuries.
If we can accommodate a steady stream of English incomers as we have
done in the past 20 years, then perhaps we can also solve the Hong Kong
problem at a stroke. If the Government is set on denying hospitality
elsewhere in the UK then why not let the island of Papa Westray open its
green acres to the legions of would-be settlers.
Anyone with a calculator will already have realised that squeezing
three million people into six square miles leaves scarcely enough room
to swing a wok. Overcrowding is guaranteed. But isn't that the whole
point of the exercise, to make the residents of Hong Kong feel at home?
Our topography, of course, is not identical to the island of Hong Kong
but I think there are enough similarities to make the idea work. We have
the North Hill, our huge bird sanctuary occupying the northern third of
the island. Thereabouts we have ample room to reassemble the Peak
district where the better-off residents could lounge on the terraces of
their penthouses and watch the birds fly by.
We'll find an Orcadian equivalent of Kai Tak in the valleys above
Hundland and Bewing. The floating market of Aberdeen should present no
difficulties. The Bay of Moclett at the south end of the island is a
sheltered anchorage and could provide moorings for as many junks as care
to make the journey from the China Seas.
The teeming fruit and vegetable markets could be recreated in the
walled garden up at the big house of Holland. Banking and commercial
enterprises would be based around Bill Irvine's front room at Links
where the flying bankers already conduct their business once a month.
Stocks may have to be increased in the co-op shop. Three bags of rice
available at any one time on the shelves may prove insufficient and
surely someone will make a killing opening a lychee import business.
Government House may present a few problems but perhaps Christine the
teacher might allow us to use the school room one afternoon when the
children are out playing. Jim Rendall, our postman, has always
maintained there is Chinese blood in his family -- he'll make an
excellent Governor.
Frequency of air services to the island may have to be increased and
better control exercised over the livestock which wander the runways.
With their love of horseracing a suitable racetrack could be laid out on
the Machair at Moclett, assuming that the rabbit holes can be filled.
Yes indeed, on closer examination the problems seem small and the
potential enormous. A few billion in development grants and we'll be up
and running. Couldn't Hong Kong really come to Scotland? Well, didn't
Birnham Wood eventually come to Dunsinane?
Yours hopefully,
JIM HEWITSON

Scotland's cities are not known primarily as wildlife havens. Peter
Evans talks to enthusiasts who know that urban spaces can be treasure
troves if you know where to look
LOOKING out of her second-storey office window across Paisley High
Street, Fiona Stewart's gaze alights on a small green hill. Spotlighted
by the sun, its grass appears almost artificially emerald, as if in an
oil painting. Atop is a lone figure, seated, and enjoying the Paisley
panorama.
This is Saucel Hill. Beyond it is the open space of Gleniffer Braes,
another valuable green oasis in this troubled urban area, better known
of late for murder, mayhem, and Temazepam abuse than the things that
matter to Stewart.
''I like this view,'' she says. ''I'm surprised there are not more
people on the hill -- it's well used.'' As urban wildlife officer for
the Scottish Wildlife Trust, Stewart tends to be more attuned to the
value of green spaces like Saucel Hill than most of us.
Her brief covers the whole of Scotland but she tends to focus in on
major urban areas such as Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Aberdeen.
''It's not enough to say that we will save rare species,'' says Stewart.
''You have got to have a wide variety of green space for people,
otherwise we are missing the mark as conservationists.''
For her, being aware of wildlife is not just marvelling at golden
eagles in the Highlands, it's about feeding the pigeons in Kelvingrove
Park, or watching the sparrows fight over crumbs on the drying-green;
it's about attracting insects and butterflies by having a few nettles
and some wild flowers in an otherwise manicured garden.
The wildlife trust is currently in the process of building these
ideals into a Greenspace Campaign. Expected to be launched next spring,
once funding is in place, the campaign will be aimed at improving the
wildlife interest of towns and cities; protecting and enhancing the
green spaces already there, and creating new ones.
''The campaign is about saving habitats which, if we don't look out,
are going to be extremely rare,'' says Stewart.
''We have to set ourselves the task of taking the message to people
that wildlife matters -- to realise that it's valuable,'' says SWT's
campaigns co-ordinator, Nigel Doar.
''The thing we are aiming at is a better urban environment for both
wildlife and people; to get people doing their bit in deciding what they
want and then getting it. We are confident that there are so many proven
advantages in having a healthy local environment that people will want
that, and if we give them the tools to achieve it, that's what the
result will be.''
Doar has no illusions about how difficult the task is going to be in
some of Scotland's poverty-stricken urban jungles. After all, if you are
out of work, you live in a tower block, and the wallpaper is peeling off
the walls with damp, improving your social and economic conditions is
likely to be a much higher priority than thinking about environmental
improvements for wildlife.
But Doar stresses that whereas bringing about social and economic
changes to lifestyle can be an uphill battle, it's relatively easy to do
something to enhance the natural environment of a neighbourhood and
boost the feeling of well-being.
''It's been shown time and time again that if you have an area which
is a nice environment, people have a greater self-respect and more
self-confidence. It's more likely to attract investment and a positive
cycle is established,'' he says.
''It's about getting people's interest, getting people involved --
but, more importantly, getting them involved for the rest of their
lives,'' says Stewart. ''The feel-good factor is very important in this
campaign. It makes people feel good to see a bit of colour, to see a bit
of greenery.''
Through the work she does for the wildlife trust, she can already
point to successes all over Scotland where green space has been
protected and its wildlife interest improved.
Right on her doorstep is Paisley Moss, a two-acre remnant of what was,
in years gone by, a much larger area of bogland, most of which has been
lost to development. What's left is designated the only local nature
reserve in Renfrew district -- ''which makes it very special''.
Renfrewshire Conservation Volunteers are active in managing the
reserve and making sure it stays as a bogland habitat, attractive to
birds like the snipe and the much rarer jack snipe, which has been seen
there.
An important aspect of the reserve is its accessibility for local
people. ''You don't need a car to get to it,'' says Stewart. ''Access is
very important. There's no point in having these areas if you can't get
to them.''
Further north in the Lochee district of Dundee, a section of disused
railway line known as the Miley has been turned into an SWT reserve.
''At one time it was earmarked for a road, but now we have the lease for
it and we are very active in the management of that area.''
In the centre of Edinburgh is Johnson Terrace Garden, another wildlife
haven. An old courtyard with a pond, it was designed at the turn of the
century by the enlightened planner Sir Patrick Geddes, who realised the
need for green space in an urban context.
Not many places are as fortunate as Glasgow in having an impressive
network of 70 parks. Covering no less than 8000 acres, the parks have
their origins in the Victorian ''park culture'' and are an integral part
of the city's heritage.
''The people of Glasgow are very protective about their parks,'' says
Stewart. That's what led to the outcry over the clearance of Barrhead
Wood on Pollok Estate to make way for the M77 extension to Ayr in
February this year. Stewart maintains that although English voices may
have been heard vocalising the protesters' case, local residents were
centrally involved in trying to protect an area they had known since
childhood.
It's that commitment from people, however small, that SWT hopes to
secure through the Greenspace Campaign -- commitment which can often
lead to what Nigel Doar calls ''the multiplier effect''. One committed
person spreads the message among others, local groups are formed,
wildlife conservation projects blossom and wild creatures benefit as a
result.
Up to now, the trust has had a mechanism for helping people who make
contact and want to do something in their own area, and Doar estimates
the trust receives, on average, one inquiry per week.
The difference with the campaign is that the trust plans to be much
more proactive. ''Instead of just waiting for people to come to us, we
will actually go and push the ideas at them,'' says Doar. He hopes this
will not be seen as the imposition of middle-class values.
''Everyone has a wildlife issue which is important to them,'' says
Stewart. Doing something about those issues will make Scotland's towns
and cities much more wildlife-friendly, more attractive places to live
in.

WHEN I was a boy I was given a printing set -- bits of rubber with
letters cut in the end, ink, and clamps. I indelibly marked everything,
other than sheets of paper, and caused great parental angst.
I graduated to carving, hacking recalcitrant chunks of timber to no
artistic avail. A Gestetner printer and roller was also a disaster,
black ink everywhere, and they soon went the same way as the first
printing set. I tried linocuts, but they were banned because I used a
bit of floor covering. Never thought they'd notice.
Next, I sketched. On every piece of spare paper I could find. My
finest work, I thought, was the drawing of a calf, turning round to lick
its rear end. It had taken hours to complete and I carried it through
triumphantly for inspection: ''Oh, Bruce, that's marvellous,'' cried
mother, ''an elephant dancing!''
So I took up writing. But every time I fondle a fragment of wood my
eyes automatically search for a blade, and I feel a sense of excitement
and repressed anticipation every time I smell printer's ink and think:
''I could have been a contender.''
The most natural human desire, apart from the desire to create life
itself, is to depict how we live; through painting, sculpture, drawing,
woodcuts, lithographs, engravings, posters, photographs. Every-which-way
we can in order to convey our message to our fellow human beings. It has
been so, since time began.
This process thrives in Inverness, at the Highland Printmakers
Workshop and Gallery in Bank Street; a workshop for all people, from
complete novice to both embryonic and established artist. Amateur and
professional alike are welcome in this vibrant, exciting environment.
If you hanker to express innermost feelings outwardly, then head for
your nearest workshop. Whether it is simply to create personalised
notepaper or an original work of art, they are equipped to meet your
every need.
There are printmaking workshops throughout Scotland which offer a
similar service to that offered in Inverness; in Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Dunfermline, Aberdeen, Dundee, and in Kirkwall. They share a common
objective: to provide access to printmaking facilities and to promote
the art of printmaking in Scotland.
The Inverness workshop faces the greatest challenge because of the
vast area it serves; hundreds of square miles, sparsely populated, but
with a long tradition in the arts. Associate workshops are planned in
Dornoch and Ullapool, but this still leaves many small townships without
access to printmaking facilities.
Workshop director Adam Sutherland hopes to meet this need by taking
the facilities to the people who wish to use them -- no easy logistical
task given the weight of even the lightest press -- and in doing so,
Sutherland hopes to strengthen the infrastructure of Highland art.
But above all, printmaking workshops are about ordinary people
describing how they see life, and having fun. I get a buzz every time I
pass Bank Street. Memories of blue-black stained fingers flood back, of
half-hidden dreams, of things I need to say.

Star-gazing in the backyard is a hobby Alan Ellis takes seriously, as
Bill Harris discovered
MOST people with gardens can boast of the occasional small rarity such
as the three-legged gnome or the one-eyed hedgehog.
Probably not too many can lay claim to a domed 10ft-high motorised
observatory complete with 16" galaxy-scanning telescope.
But perhaps it's not so unsual for an Englishman born in India, raised
partly in Egypt, whose career began as a tailor's apprentice in Saville
Row, detoured to Vietnam with the US Marine Corps special services,
before surfacing in Scotland in the North Sea oil industry.
Submerging is probably more appropriate than surfacing since Alan
Ellis's first love (next to star-gazing) is diving. A bad car crash in
1976 put paid to his diving career.
Based in Blairs, a 10-minute drive south westwards from Aberdeen,
Ellis may have plumbed the depths and gazed at the heavens, but home is
now very much this corner of Scotland.
Home and the attached business is in what was originally a simple
stone-built gardener's cottage in the grounds of a large estate. Both
house and laboratory have steadily grown during the past few years.
Rolling fields and woodland along with close neighbours such as deer,
squirrels, woodpeckers, and magpies, create an almost unreal setting for
such a hi-tech business.
It is this two-and-a-half acre setting that will be home for the Ellis
observatory later this year (Sir Patrick Moore no less, has been invited
to perform the grand opening).
Ellis intends to dedicate the observatory to James Gregory, a
seventeenth-century Aberdeenshire physicist and one of the early
pioneers of modern reflective telescope design.
Ellis says: ''I think the Scots in general and people from this part
of Scotland in particular, tend to play down their achievements. Some of
the most important discoveries were made here yet they remain largely
unrecognised. I hope my observatory will give Gregory some of the
belated credit which he's due.''
The son of a British soldier, Ellis's love affair with the stars began
at the age of four when the family moved from India to Egypt (after
stopping briefly in Blighty at the end of the war). ''Looking at the
stars from the Arabian desert was something else,'' he recalls. ''From
that moment on I was hooked.''
Back in England, education at a military boarding school followed but
it wasn't to Sandhurst young Ellis travelled but to Saville Row and an
apprenticeship as a tailor. The pay was chocolate buttons for young
Ellis was able to display his self-confessed ''weakness'' for
perfectionism by winning three trophies during his apprenticeship
(despite being totally colour blind).
He recalls with a laugh: ''There was one occasion when I was making a
red sports jacket for a wealthy American. He came into the shop for a
fitting and I gave him his jacket which had one red arm and one black
arm. Naturally, the senior tailors had watched me doing it over the
weeks and had said nothing. Fortunately the American had a sense of
humour too!''
Despite making coats of many colours, young Ellis was thought highly
enough by the firm to be dispatched to America to open a branch office.
''Unfortunately it was 1965 and the worst possible time to go,'' he
says. ''The Vietnam war was in full swing and if you wanted to stay for
more than a year, you had to do military service in the American armed
forces.''
Ellis decided to volunteer for the Marine Corps thinking it would be a
two-year enlistment, only to discover it was four (''I should have read
the small print''). Boot camp was Paris Island, Louisiana where tough
Marine instructors initially looked on the tailor's apprentice as
something of a softy.
''What they didn't know was that I had attended a military boarding
school and was used to discipline and drilling from an early age,'' he
says.
''From around 12 years old we were using .303 calibre British Army
rifles which weighted 14lbs. The American Armalites issued by the Marine
Corps weighed 7lbs. I was also a good shot. So Boot Camp didn't present
me with too many problems.
Ellis's ''weakness'' for perfection stayed with him through Paris
Island. He passed out of Boot Camp as Top Cadet which allowed him the
luxury of choosing which of the services to enter. He chose the Marines'
Special Forces diving section because ''I always wanted to be a diver''.
Ironically, the American Navy, which had turned him down because of
his colour blindness, now had to train him to dive. Diving training in
the Philippines was followed by service in Vietnam, about which Ellis is
characteristically unforthcoming.
Duty to Uncle Sam duly done, and a career in Saville Row well and
truly over, Ellis swapped the waters of the South China Sea for
commercial oil industry diving firstly in The Gulf and later in Ireland,
Norway and latterly the North Sea.
Because of his car crash injuries, Ellis now 51, can no longer indulge
in his first love of diving, so is looking forward to studying the stars
instead.
With what will be one of the most powerful private observatories in
Scotland, he will be able to observe clearly such space-gazing delights
as the rings around Saturn, the coloration of Mars, and Jupiter.
He says: ''One of the benefits of living here is that in the winter
the skies are clearer and there is less pollution, so conditions are
ideal for observing the galaxy.
''The site is already prepared in the garden and I'm hopeful that Sir
Patrick Moore will be able to find time to come up to do the
inauguration.''

* ON A still, dull evening at the end of June, between the swish of
passing traffic and the snip of my secateurs, a strange, insistent noise
slowly seeped into my consciousness. If I had not known what it was, I
doubt that I should have paid it attention at all. From out across the
tall green wheat in the field by the garden it sounded as if a bicycle
was rapidly freewheeling in the distance, or an angler was reeling in an
endless line. The noise went on for a minute or two consecutively but
the volume rose and fell and gently rose again. It did not sound like a
bird at all, yet it was one. It certainly did not sound like a
grasshopper, least of all a Scottish one, yet a grasshopper warbler is
just precisely what it was.
This is the nearest we have to an invisible bird. It is a little,
slim, streaky brown warbler which habitually creeps along the bottom of
tangled scrub and reeds, making its nest in a tussock. In Scotland it is
at the northern edge of its range and though not uncommon in lowland
areas its numbers vary according to the spring weather and what's been
drained and what's been planted.
''The whisper of this little bird . . . when close at your ear, is
scarce any louder than when a great way off,'' wrote Gilbert White in
1768. You can follow that sound for a kilometre before you find its
origin, and as the bird turns its head its ventriloquy disorientates
your search. I have heard them often, in a reed bed, a hawthorn hedge
and out on the marram grass of the dunes, but only once did I see one,
perched quivering on a thorn spray one April morning. Freshly arrived
from south of the Sahara, it was uncharacteristically kenspeckle.
I may never see one again, but I will know they are resident somewhere
in the locality -- every year till the pitch of the song grows too high
for my hearing.

Special travel correspondent Katie Wood suggests that a house swop
could be the route to a great holiday that will not break your budget
and leave you feeling like a tourist
HOME swopping is an increasingly popular way to have a cheap holiday
and get the feeling of being a local, not a tourist when abroad. Home
Base Holidays are one of the UK's largest and most established agencies
which arranges swopping your two-up-two-down in Scotland for, if you're
lucky, a villa with pool in anywhere from Florence to Florida.
Join their swopping club by October 9 and you will have your exchange
offer published free in their first directory of the new season, as well
as being sent three new directories as soon as published. As well as
this you will receive a free copy of their popular guide Bed &amp; Breakfast
in the United States &amp; Canada. Normal membership costs #39 (+#9 to
include a photo with listing). For more information call 0181 886 8752.
* AT MAYS is urging us to book early for 1996 summer holidays as it
says there could be as many as one million fewer packages available next
year (which given the disastrous season many tour operators have just
had, could well be true -- capacity for next year is likely to be
dramatically cut).
As a booking incentive AT Mays is offering 12% off the following
brochures: Sunworld Greece and Beach Villas, Freespirit holidays from
First Choice, selected Cosmos holidays, and Inspirations Balearic
islands and Spanish mainland holidays. 10% is also taken off virtually
every other leading holiday company. Summer 1996 holidays can be booked
for a #5 deposit and AT Mays is then offering 20% off the cost of travel
insurance for children aged between two and 15 years.
* ICELANDAIR is starting services to Boston in the USA and Halifax,
Nova Scotia next May. With connecting flights from Glasgow to their hub
airport, Keflavik, in Iceland they intend their fares to be competitive
and extremely attractive to Scots who are not keen to use English
airports as a hub. Economy return fares are predicted to run at about
the #300 return mark. Watch out in the spring for further news. For more
information call 0171 388 5599.
* AFTER the success of its first year's operation from Scotland,
Portland Holidays -- the UK's leading direct-booking tour operator --
has launched its 1996 brochure with Florida as a new destination.
Twenty-seven destinations in total are featured from Glasgow, seven from
Edinburgh, and three from Aberdeen. A sample price from their new
brochure is #344 per person for a fortnight in Orlando, including
flights, accommodation, and free car hire. For a brochure call 0345
951000 or for reservations call 0141 532 0532.
* THERE'S now an easy and quick way to sample the delights of Italian
holidays for Scots. Citalia is flying Glasgow to Pisa, Naples, and
Verona, and Edinburgh to Venice, which opens up all manner of
interesting options for next year's holidays. New for 1996 is the tiny
village of Montaione, 50 miles from Pisa and 15 miles from San
Gimignano. There's also Wine Tours in Umbria and Tuscany, combined with
a few days in Florence. A sample price on this itinerary is #799.
Contact Citalia on 0181 686 5533, or get the new brochure from an ABTA
travel agent.
* LOOKING for a last-minute getaway? Avro have flights to Alicante on
October 14 from Glasgow for #169 for 14 nights. Call 0141 303 0303.
* GLOBESPAN has expanded its North American routes for 1996 out of
Scottish airports. A new service to Los Angeles from Glasgow uses World
Airways. Orlando is also available weekly while New York's JFK airport
is served from both Edinburgh and Glasgow. Boston is available direct
from Glasgow, and the company will continue to run its charters to
Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver from Glasgow. Travel agents should have
all details.
* CRUISING needn't just be for granny and grandpa. Families are
increasingly being catered for on the cruiseships of the nineties. For a
free brochure on Cruising with Children, giving full details of the best
lines and ships, call Page &amp; Moy on 0116 251 3377. The company also
publish a Cruise Hot List which details all the cruise late bargains and
late availability from every major cruise liner -- well worth getting
hold of if you're planning any sort of cruise as literally hundreds of
pounds per person can be saved.
* LOOKING for a good price on a round-the-world air ticket? Quest
Worldwide Travel is offering a fare of just #696 for departures up until
November 30 for onward travel to Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane. Optional
stopovers include Dubai and Bangkok or Singapore. Travellers must make
their own way to Sydney for the homeward flight (the company can offer
coach, rail, air or self-drive options) which must be between February
and May 15, 1996. The stopover on the inbound journey can be in Los
Angeles or San Francisco, and all travel must be completed by May 16,
1996. The direct sell operator is on 0181 547 3322.
* FRANCE is expensive enough with the franc/pound exchange rate
situation, but from here on in restaurant meals and drinks in a bar will
cost even more as a result of a hike in the VAT rate to 20.6%. That's
the bad news. The good news is that hotel rooms and pitch rental on
campsites are exempt from VAT rises; accommodation stays at just 5.5%,
the same rate that's charged on food from shops. So, it seems if you're
planning a holiday in France, self-catering is the only option!

HIDDEN TREASURES OF SCOTTISH GOLF: Part Two
Ron Marshall continues his journey round some of the fine, but less
well-known courses. This week, Central Scotland
Understated grandeur with majestic vistas
OUR Norwegian friend has never been in much doubt about the reason for
the Viking visits to the Firth of Clyde some seven centuries ago. ''They
went to Scotland to trade, nothing more,'' he has insisted these past 20
years, recalling his Oslo equivalent of Primary 7 history lessons.
Not so, says the Largs Historical Society -- or the spanking new
Vikingar extravaganza at the old Barrfields Pavilion. King Haakon IV,
ruler of all the Scottish islands, sought to annexe Bute and the
Cumbraes. But in 1263 he was at the receiving end of a little shoreline
skirmish -- near that marina where a few squillion pounds worth of
boaties bob around -- after which Haakon and his assorted ''traders''
retreated to Orkney.
So much for this lightning skim through the chronicles of Largs' dim
and distant past. Another historical, admittedly less venerable,
document traces the development of golf in the town back to 1891, and by
a small coincidence the present location of Largs Golf Club is just a
couple of hundred yards from where the locals and bearded matelots
traded blows all those years ago.
You can just imagine the barely suppressed excitement in far-flung
parts of the world that momentous year -- the labourers starting work on
the trans-Siberian railway, Gauguin settling in Tahiti, Joe Chamberlain
becoming Liberal leader -- all of them breathless to know if the
gathering in the Lesser St Columba Hall, Largs, had decided to take the
plunge and build a course at Routenburn. (Confession: that research was
stolen from the club's centenary compiler, Jim Patrick).
They certainly did. Nor did they let the grass grow, figuratively
speaking at least. Having called in the design services of Ranfurly
professional Willie Campbell, the membership, swollen from 30 to 60 just
two weeks after the inaugural meeting, were playing on their new
nine-hole course less than three months later.
Only two years after establishing their course in 1891 Largs Golf Club
moved to their present site on ground leased from the Earl of Glasgow,
owner of Kelburn Estate. The new location was less precipitous and more
central, and that leasing arrangement lasted with successive earls until
the early 1980s, when, after much aggression and infighting within the
club, the membership negotiated ownership of the course at a cost of
#130,000. A levy of #200 per member forced the resignation of around
200, leaving the coffers bare.
Suddenly visiting parties were made even more welcome; new members
were spared an entry fee, and within a few years financial stability was
restored, and major course projects were again dusted off. The current
intention, for example, is to plant 3000 trees and shrubs in the next
few years although the terrain is hardly short of a mighty trunk or two
-- there are even palm trees beside the new clubhouse. Inside there's no
shortage of chit-chat and banter.
Former captain Eddie Urquhart recalled the painful day, early in his
golfing apprenticeship, when he was asked by the club's star player,
Alex MacGregor, to join him in a midweek competition. ''Nobody else was
around -- he was stuck for somebody to mark his card,'' admitted Eddie.
Alex, a graduate of the doesn't-suffer-fools-gladly school, maintained
a stolid silence for a few holes while watching the efforts of new boy
Eddie, then felt compelled to speak.
''Who taught you to play?''
''I've read an instruction book,'' conceded our tiro.
''Well, you've read the wrong one!'' came the rasping reply.
Away from the stresses of critical partners and facing up to
three-foot putts, just south of the golf club entrance is Kelburn Castle
and Country Centre, a place for the whole family to relax and enjoy a
variety of pursuits.
Ancestral home of the Earls of Glasgow, the place offers falconry,
horse-riding, an adventure stockade, and the most recent attraction, the
Secret Forest. This has maze-like pathways through almost impenetrable
woods, overhead walkways, and underground passages -- maybe just the
place to lose the kids while you explore the beauties of the castle and
walled garden. For #3.50 (adults) or #2 (children) the Kelburn Centre
will easily provide a day's entertainment -- there's even a free
mini-bus service from Largs railway station (April 15-August 31).
Phoning 01475 568685 will give you every detail.
If your stay demands more than a Nardini's ice-cream then local
opinion points towards Brisbane House Hotel as the one to emulate; nice
things are also said about the reopened Elderslie Hotel and Haylie House
Hotel.
Hands up those of you who'd be hard pressed to find the Kilmarnock
Barassie course . . . no, it's not in or even near Kilmarnock (unless
you think seven miles away is close). Instead it's part of that historic
golfing strip which ribbons southwards out of Irvine heading towards
Prestwick, unfurling Glasgow Gailes, Western Gailes, and then the
curiously named Kilmarnock Barassie.
Right beside Barassie railway station (and not by coincidence either)
the clubhouse and course manage to give the impression of understated
grandeur, of perpetuity, while the membership display an understandable
pride in owning such an asset.
Little wonder, then, that the members of what was originally the
Ossington Golf Club (named after a coffee tavern popular with Kilmarnock
businessmen) had the good sense to lease the 123 acres at Barassie in
1894 after seven years of renting farmland at Kilmarnock, to which the
owner's Ayrshire cattle had unfettered access.
Barassie, whose velvet turf and sunset views over the Arran mountains
are but two of its prized attractions, has long been a qualifying course
for the Open Championship, and deservedly so. There is, therefore, no
desire within the club to ape the so-called championship courses that
spring up all across the place boasting measurements of almost 7000
yards. They're very content to have a yardage of 6473 and leave the
ingenuity of the layout to provide the sternest of examinations.
Club secretary Robert Bryce typifies the pride taken in all things
associated with Barassie. Hadn't they just become the first Scottish
club to win the European championship in Portugal last November -- and
without the services of Walker Cup hero Jim Milligan? Their three-man
team of Gordon Sherry, Leslie Crawford, and Alan Reid had a three-stroke
victory at Vilamoura over the French representatives, Nimes, from an
entry of 22 countries.
And Gordon, splendid exemplar of Tall Golfing Man (he's most
particular you get his height right -- it's 6ft 7[3/4]in!), won the
elegant trophy for the best individual score of 280 (71, 69, 70, 70) but
of course went on to greater things this season by winning the Amateur
Championship and showing the top professionals a thing or two by taking
fourth place in the Scottish Open at Carnoustie.
But it's the course, and not any single player, that epitomises
Kilmarnock Barassie. From the club's wonderfully written history by Alan
Stewart comes this glowing testimonial from Peter Alliss after he'd
played his Open qualifying rounds there in 1973: '' . . . all budding
greenkeepers should be made to go for a week to see how 18 holes can be
maintained to perfection by only three men. The course was absolutely
splendid.''
From one sublime setting on the west coast to another equally
majestic, this time on the Firth of Forth. With the islands of Fidra,
Craigleith, and Bass Rock deployed as rocky sentinels, North Berwick
offers a vista calculated to assuage the most stressed of psyches. But
like so many Scottish seaside resorts it has known better days. The
package-holiday era did its best to crush the vitality and enterprise of
the likes of Arbroath, Carnoustie, Rothesay, and dozens of other towns
dependent on paw, maw, and the weans having their fortnight's break in
summertime.
But, according to North Berwick's professional and course manager,
David Huish, the golf course has been the town's unshakeable economic
lifeline. ''Our hotels, guest-houses, shops, and restaurants have beaten
the departure of the sunseekers,'' he points out, ''only because this
wonderfully natural links course has drawn tens of thousands of
enthusiasts over the years.''
In all his travels -- and Huish, leader after two rounds of the Open
Championship at Carnoustie in 1975, has seen many courses of the world
-- he claims he's never found one other than North Berwick where he'd
rather play the rest of his life.
He would have that opinion heartily endorsed by one particular group
of Americans who visited the course some years ago. Having played one
round, they were due the next day at Gleneagles King's course. To a man
(and there were 25 of them) they forsook the opportunity, having already
pre-paid the Gleneagles green fee, and plumped for another day's
enjoyment on the East Lothian course.
The club's history -- it was founded in 1832 -- reflects the status of
the game at that time. If you weren't an earl, marquis, lord, or
brigadier your chances of becoming captain were pretty slim. One A J
Balfour is on the clubhouse board of captains in 1891. Splendid
training, no doubt, for No 10 Downing Street 11 years later.
But David Huish and secretary Bill Gray prefer to look to the future.
David enthuses about developing the game in young children.
''We have something unique here -- a course exclusively for
children,'' he explains. Around 140 from five-year-olds upwards are
taught the courtesies and rudiments of the game, they have their own
competitions with a gala-day atmosphere, with most of the paperwork and
organisation done by Lady Malcolm, daughter of a former captain, Sir
David Home, aided by a group of willing helpers.
This development, more than anything, seems to give the professional a
deep sense of satisfaction. Away from golf there are other areas of
interest. The Scottish Archery Centre, for example, is a few miles away
at Fenton Barns (tel 01620 850401), where visitors can try modern-day
equipment under supervision. And just up the road the impressive
twelfth-century Dirleton Castle and gardens are worth a visit.
Accommodation is never a problem in North Berwick -- the Marine Hotel,
and Golf Hotel are among the best known, and a variety of pubs, from
couthy to classy, should satisfy most tastes.
Next I travelled from one ancient golfing community to another -- as
the crow flies just 15 miles away but involving a two-hour car drive
back to the Forth Road Bridge and into the furthest tip of Fife. Crail
doesn't suffer from being a few miles from the Home of Golf -- it
thrives, because a willing overflow from St Andrews make their way to
the charming Balcomie Links knowing the green fee will be #18 compared
with #50 on the Old Course or #25 on the New.
Crail Golfing Society is the seventh oldest in Scotland, dating back
to 1786. Like so many others, the course was originally leased farmland,
and also like the others there were disagreements with the farmer about
sharing with animals. The Crail Society, too, moved a few miles, from
Sauchope to the current location along a narrow road past a piggery
described as one of the biggest in the country. Old Fleet Air Arm
billets can still be seen -- the former wartime airstrip now resounds to
the buzzing of go-karts on selected days of the year.
Membership at Crail is around 1000, almost half of them from outwith
the immediate vicinity. A little anomaly exists over the difference
between men's and women's fees, which any self-respecting feminist would
take delight in sinking without trace.
Since their inception in 1901 the women have always paid #3 less. At
the turn of the century that difference could represent a fair
percentage. Not now, though. The fees are #117 and #114 respectively --
and the women don't have a vote at the annual meeting! And if a few
readers who're also golf club members are amazed that a club of Crail's
quality asks such paltry sums, the answer is obvious. Around 17,000
visitors played the course last year.
The town, with its red pantiles, stepped gables, and friendly shop
service, offers abundant watering-holes and resting places -- among them
the Balcomie Links, Golf, Croma, and Marine hotels and Smugglers Inn.
But if the golfing gentlemen of Fife Ness think they've got history on
their side, then, as far as clubhouses go, they take second billing to
those who occupy Pitfirrane House, Dunfermline -- a confusing place to
find, as a group of Bearsden ladies travelling in several cars
discovered a few years ago. Half of them turned up at Pitreavie.
The headquarters of Dunfermline Golf Club, Pitfirrane, in the village
of Crossford, west of the royal burgh, must be the grandest and most
ancient of any in the country. Boasting a history going back 600 years,
the turreted building became the clubhouse when the golfers moved to
their present location in 1953 after spells at Halbeath, Ferryhills, and
Torrie -- four courses from 1887 to the present day.
Formerly the home of the Halkett family, Pitfirrane was bought by the
membership from the Carnegie Trust in 1966 for #12,000. Without a doubt,
they purchased a piece of history. Almost every step taken inside the
clubhouse (except the aesthetically questionable modern bar and lounge)
reveals artefacts of breathtaking antiquity -- exquisite stained-glass
windows above the sixteenth-century stone spiral staircase, ornate oak
panelling of ancient coats of arms, a dining-room ceiling with armorial
bearings, and a women's locker-room with an arched ceiling (apparently a
former place of worship).
The course was believed to be one of the finest inland designs in the
country until the 1968 hurricane caused the loss of around 20 large
trees that were crucial to the playing characteristics of so many holes.
The benefits of tree plantation since that disastrous night have still
to be reaped.
Dunfermline itself offers diversion enough for those not of a golfing
disposition. As every schoolchild ought to know, the tomb of King Robert
the Bruce can be seen at the abbey, the shops, it's claimed, provide for
almost every need, the home of Andrew Carnegie can be visited all year
round, and Pittencrieff Park provides beautiful parkland and gardens,
aviaries, and monkey houses within 76 acres.
Last stop on this meander through Central Scotland is Stirling,
gateway to the Highlands. In Bruce's day it was the military key to the
Scottish Kingdom during the Wars of Independence against England in the
late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, and considered to be the
finest example of a medieval burgh in Scotland.
And royalty impinges on King's Park, the land on which Stirling golf
course is laid out. Owned by the Crown Commissioners, the ground has
been leased by the members since around the turn of the century (the
club came into existence in 1869). Legendary figures from the world of
golf have made their mark on the course design -- Tom Morris Jr, Willie
Fernie, James Braid, and Henry Cotton -- and a massive tree-planting
scheme has, over many years, enhanced a fine challenge of 6400 yards.
The club's genial professional is Ian Collins. I mention him only
because of his celebrated hole-in-one at Glenbervie in the Scottish
championship in 1987, where he raced the length of the hole and fell
down in sheer delight on the green. No wonder. The prize was a #37,000
Porsche Carrera.

PROSECUTING counsel Brian Leveson, QC, yesterday described how over a
period of many years how Rosemary and Frederick West enticed or abducted
young girls to 25 Cromwell Street and there sexually abused them in the
most depraved and appalling way.
Opening the Crown case against Rosemary West who faces 10 murder
charges, he described how police digging at 25 Cromwell Street found
what was more terrible than words could express. Over the days which
followed, the skeletal remains of eight young women were found buried at
the home of Mr and Mrs West.
Mr Leveson said: ''Each one had been dismembered, heads had been
decapitated and in every set of remains bones were missing. Each was
dumped without dignity or respect in a different small hole some 3ft
below the ground in the garden, in the cellar, and underneath a
bathroom. One of the victims carried a foetus in its ninth month of
gestation.''
Charmaine West
THE first victim was Mrs West's stepdaughter, Charmaine, the court
heard.
Frederick West had met his future wife Rosemary in 1969 when she was
15. They moved into a flat and by early 1970 she was pregnant. By the
summer of 1970 they had moved to 25 Midland Road.In 1970, Frederick West
was arrested and subsequently sentenced to 10 months in prison.
''At the age of 17, it cannot have been easy for Rosemary West to cope
with Charmaine, only 10 years younger, another stepdaughter, and the new
baby Heather in a small flat. There is clear evidence that Charmaine was
greatly disliked by Rosemary West.''
A neighbour, living in the top floor flat, had a daughter, Tracey, who
was the same age as Charmaine and became friendly with her.
That neighbour's recollection was that Mrs West often said she could
no longer cope with Charmaine. She recalls that she disliked Charmaine's
rebellious nature.
One morning Tracey was sent to borrow a cup of milk. She saw Charmaine
standing on a wooden chair with her hands tied behind her back with a
belt. Mrs West had a large wooden spoon in her hand and looked as though
she was about to hit her.
Mr Leveson described how Charmaine vanished sometime in 1971. Tracey,
even today, remembers asking: ''Where is Charmaine?'' Mrs West replied:
''Gone to live with her mother and bloody good riddence.''
Charmaine had not gone to live with her mother and was never seen
again.
Asked by police when she last saw Charmaine, Mrs West said it was when
Rena, the girl's mother, took her. The Crown said there was no such
occasion. Rena, in fact, was buried at Kempley and Charmaine never left
25 Midland Road.
A skeleton found there was, the Crown said, the remains of Charmaine.
Many wrist, finger, foot, and toe bones were missing. It might well be
the legs had been disarticulated at the hips.
''How did Charmaine die?'' counsel asked the jury. ''If she had been
very ill and died, her body would not have been concealed. It would not
have been necessary to lie about her whereabouts at the time or
subsequently.''
He told the jury they could be sure that she had been killed.
Carol Ann Cooper
A REBELLIOUS teenager, Carol Ann became disruptive and troublesome and
was placed in a children's home.
On November 9, 1973, she was allowed to sleep away from the home and
went to her grandmother's house overnight, returning the next morning to
keep a doctor's appointment. She kept that appointment and later met a
boyfriend who put her on a bus to Worcester. She was not seen again.
''We do not know how Carol came to get off the bus without returning
to her grandmother,'' said Mr Leveson. ''What we do know is she ended up
in Cromwell Street.''
Just over 20 years later, on March 10 last year, her remains were
found in the cellar. Once again, there were a number of bones missing,
especially from the feet and hands, the skull was taken off and the legs
dismembered. Around the skull was a band of elasticated cloth -- another
form of gag.
''In some way, whether by the offer of a lift as with Caroline Owens,
or by some other method of abduction, the Crown contends that it is
obvious this vulnerable girl fell into a trap where she was brought to
Cromwell Street and there rendered helpless, though kept alive for the
pleasures of those who wished to abuse her body,'' said Mr Leveson.
Mrs West could not have remained ignorant of this 15-year-old in the
cellar. She must have had knowledge of her presence and the purpose of
that presence, he added. ''We submit that the proper inference to be
drawn is that Rosemary West was a party both to the imprisonment of
Carol and her subsequent death.''
Therese Siegenthaler
THERESE, who was born in Switzerland on November 27, 1952, was
studying sociology at the then Woolwich Polytechnic.
An experienced hitch-hiker, she planned to travel to Ireland during
the Easter vacation of 1974. She was never seen again.
On March 5 last year, her remains were unearthed in the basement of 25
Cromwell Street.
''How she got to Cromwell Street the Crown cannot say,'' Mr Leveson
said.
''She must have been abducted. Once kidnapped and secured in Cromwell
Street, she met her death.
''Once again, the body had been decapitated and the hips
disarticulated. At the burial site was a knotted cloth loop adjacent to
the skull -- as it would have been used to secure the victim's mouth.''
Lynda Gough
THE events surrounding Lynda Gough's death occurred within weeks of
the Wests stepping out of the magistrates court on January 12, 1973,
having been prosecuted for the attack on Caroline Owens.
Lynda had enjoyed a normal childhood and adolescence although she did
have some learning difficulties. At the age of 16, she started work as a
seamstress. One of the places she visited was 25 Cromwell Street to meet
a young man who was lodging there. He and other lodgers had a sexual
relationship with the girl.
In 1973, Lynda decided to leave home. Her mother said a woman called
at the family home to collect Lynda and take her out for a drink. This,
they said, was Rosemary West. A week or two later Mrs Gough returned
home at lunchtime to find that her 19-year-old daughter had taken all
her possessions and left home.
Mrs Gough made her own inquiries which led her to 25 Cromwell Street.
She knocked on the door which was answered by a man and a woman.
The Crown alleges the woman was Rosemary West. Initially, she was not
prepared to admit Lynda had even been at the home. However, Mrs Gough
noticed she was wearing Lynda's slippers and said as much. She also
noticed some washing which was Lynda's clothing. Mrs West said Lynda had
been at the house but had left.
''The Crown contends that she had been murdered and buried in what had
been an inspection pit in a shed or garage,'' said Mr Leveson.
Her body was found about 3ft from the surface. Many bones were
missing, particularly from the hands and feet, and the body had been
dismembered. The most important find was a mask of wound adhesive tape
close to the skull. There were also two loose pieces of tape. There was
no clothing.
Mr Leveson reminded the jury that tape had been wound around Caroline
Owens's face. ''The circle of masking tape provides the clearest
evidence that she was naked but gagged.''
Lucy Partington
LUCY was studying medieval English at Exeter University when on
December 20 she re turned home to Gretton for the Christmas vacation.
On December 27, she visited a close friend. She left her house at
10.15pm in a bit of a rush to catch the last bus from Cheltenham back to
Gretton. She was never seen again.
The Crown contended that this serious minded but gentle girl must have
been picked up at a bus stop by the Wests.
''Once again, more than 20 years were to pass before the remains were
discovered, chopped, dismembered, and forced into a hole in the cellar
floor at 25 Cromwell Street,'' said Mr Leveson.
''As with the others, what is of particular importance for our purpose
is not only what was not in the grave -- Lucy's clothes and belongings
-- but what other items were found with the remains.''
Among the bones there was a very sharp kitchen knife. The blade edge
had been sharpened and it could well have been used for dismembering the
body which itself pointed clearly to the task being performed at
Cromwell Street. ''Why bury it with the body if it had not been?''
counsel said.
At 25 minutes past midnight on January 3, 1974 -- seven days after
Lucy's disappearance -- Frederick West went to Gloucester Royal Hospital
with a laceration of his right hand.
''That, the Crown contend, supports the inference that Frederick West
was involved in the dismemberment of this body that night. There seems
to be no point or reason to keep Lucy's body unburied for days after she
had been murdered,'' said Mr Leveson. ''There is no basis for thinking,
however, that she was necessarily killed on the day she was abducted.
''It is perfectly feasible and, we submit from the evidence, a
legitimate conclusion that once taken she was kept alive for whatever
hideous purpose, for some days.''
Counsel said that here was a victim who would never have joined the
West household voluntarily. If Lucy was picked up from a bus stop, Mrs
West must have been involved.
Shirley Hubbard
BORN on June 26, 1959, Shirley Hubbard was taken into care when only
two. Four years later, she was placed with foster parents.
In October 1974, she ran away from home and was found camping in a
field near Worcester. The following month she ran away again and her
foster parents never heard from her again.
Mr Leveson said it was on March 5, 1994, that her remains were found
in the basement. ''The Crown submits that the only proper conclusion is
Shirley was picked up from the streets, just like Caroline Owens, Lucy
Partington, and others,'' he said.
''Once picked up, she was then taken to Cromwell Street, perhaps
willingly, where she was kept in secret, murdered, and buried in secret
until her remains were discovered.''
Her remains were discovered in an excavation through the concrete and
plastic membrane of the cellar floor.She had been decapitated and her
legs severed from her body before burial. Mr Leveson said: ''When the
skull was removed, it was encased in a mask made of consecutive windings
of brown adhesive tape passing around the skull from below the chin to
above eye-level.
''Inserted into the front of this mask was narrow plastic tube in the
nostril position with about 3in of tube internally bent upwards in the
position which would enter the nostril,'' he said. ''There was a short
length of tube protuding from the mask.
''The breathing tube or tubes demonstrate that Shirley must have been
alive when the mask was applied. Its purpose can only have been to keep
her wholly under control, unable to see, unable to cry out, just to
breathe.''
He said the Crown submitted that the only proper conclusion was that
she was kept alive but helpless. That could only have been for sexual
gratification.
The jury might think this could only have been done with the knowledge
and active participation of Mrs West.
Heather West
PROSECUTION counsel Brian Leveson said Heather West -- the Wests'
eldest natural child -- would have been an infant, a toddler, and a very
young child when Charmaine and the others were killed one by one.
There was no direct evidence she knew what had been going on or what
an examination of the cellar or the garden would reveal. If she did know
something, she would hardly have been able to tell and certainly not
while she lived at home.
Mr Leveson said there was growing friction between the Wests and
Heather.
What was clear was that on June 16, four months short of her 17th
birthday, she disappeared. Mrs West's reaction to this disappearance to
one of Heather's workmakes was: ''There was a hell of a row here a
couple of nights ago. We found out that she was going with a lesbian
from Wales and she has gone to Wales with her.''
This was simply untrue. Others who inquired were told similar stories.
Heather did not leave home. She was murdered and buried naked in the
garden, said Mr Leveson. None of her possessions had been recovered --
none of her clothes, none of her belongings.
When police started making intensive inquiries about Heather in 1992,
they could find no trace. Ultimately, it was those inquiries which led
them to obtain the original search warrant for 25 Cromwell Street.
Two days short of the seven years after she had been dismembered and
interred in the garden, with the patio extended to cover her, the
remains were found.
Her body had been dismembered. The head had been decapitated using a
knife or sharp-edged instrument. Both thighs had been chopped with a
sharp heavy instrument, an axe or spade. Once again, bones were missing
mainly form the feet and hands, although some detached fingernails were
discovered.
Two lengths of rope -- perhaps used to tie hands and feet together --
were also found.
In 1992, Mrs West told police that Heather had left home. She could
not remember if her husband had reported her missing.
Mr Leveson said the precise motive for the death of Heather was
speculative, but could have been because she knew too much about what
had gone on. It could have been because there was a blazing row or
because Heather was resisting attempts to involve her sexually.
Juanita Mott
THE last girl in the series of five whom the Crown said were killed
from November 1973 to April 1975 was Juanita Mott. She was born on March
1, 1957, and was a very rebellious and self-willed girl.
In the summer of 1974, she met a young man named Timothy Davis and,
during the six weeks he came to know her, she moved to 25 Cromwell
Street. Like the others, she disappeared and was never seen again. In
March 1994, 19 years later, her remains were found in the basement of 25
Cromwell Street.
She had suffered a severe depressed fracture of the skull caused by a
heavy impact, probably with a circular or dome-shaped object such as a
ball-headed hammer.
There was a plastic covered rope like a clothesline wrapped around the
upper end of her upper arm which went to the right leg and was wrapped
around the thighbone. The only conclusion was that, when she was buried,
dismembered as she was, her bindings were still in place.
Around the top of the skull there was a band of fabric passing under
the jaw and around the back of the head. This time it was not tape but
could well have been her own clothing -- two long nylon socks, a bra,
and two pairs of tights, one within the other.
The only reason she could have been bound and gagged would have been
to keep her helpless but still living for sexual gratification. ''She
died while she was being degraded either as part of what for her
attackers was doubtless fun or because she could not be released
afterwards,'' Mr Leveson said.
Alison Chambers
FOLLOWING the collapse of her parents' marriage, Alison, who was born
on September 8, 1962, became difficult and rebellious and, at the age of
14 or 15, she was taken into care.
In the summer of 1979, she was seen at 25 Cromwell Street, on several
occasions. Shortly before her 17th birthday, she disappeared. On
February 28, 1994, her remains were unearthed in the garden of 25
Cromwell Street.
Once again the body had been dismembered, doubtless to reduce the hole
into which it could be stuffed. Numerous foot and hand bones were
missing as were some other bones.
This time it was not tape but a wide leather belt with a large buckle
passing from under the chin to the top of the head.
This belt, clamping closed her jaw, must have been used to stop her
screaming.
Shirley Anne Robinson
THE court heard that Mrs West knew all about Frederick West's affair
with one of his lodgers, Shirley Anne Robinson. Shirley, however, was
the next victim and the first to be buried outside the house. She was
the only victim at Cromwell Street whose remains were found without any
sort of tape or rope on the body.
By the autumn of 1977, she had become pregnant and it was common
knowledge that the father was Frederick West.
Mr Leveson said it looked as if Mrs West might initially have been
able to accept the apparently intolerable situation. At this time, Mrs
West was pregnant with her daughter, Tara, and after her birth, her
acceptance did not appear to have lasted and there was increased tension
in the house.
Like many others, Shirley disappeared. One excuse was that she was
moving to Scotland permanently. That was clearly never true, said
prosecuting counsel. Her remains were found in the rear garden of 25
Cromwell Street.
The right thigh bone had been chopped through, there was evidence of
decapitation, and numerous bones on the hands and feet were missing.
Most significantly, with these remains were those of a foetus of
something in the order of eight months' gestation. The Crown did not
have to prove motive but it was possibly that of removing the threat to
the stability of the relationship between Rosemary and Frederick West.
''On any showing, Rosemary West had a much stronger motive for ending
the life of Shirley Robinson than did her husband,'' said Mr Leveson.
Questioned about Shirley Robinson just before the body was found, Mrs
West had no recollection of her.
''Everyone else knew about Shirley Robinson and her pregnancy all
these years afterwards. Even years on, we submit that it is ludicrous
for Mrs West to pretend that she did not remember such a dramatic and
disturbing part of her life,'' the QC added.

Aileen Little meets an artist who puts a special spin on her ceramics
PHILOMENA Pretsell's ceramics are like her name and her personality:
flamboyant, quirky, and fizzing with good humour. And her tableware
displays such exuberance that Pretsell seems quite surprised so many
people like it. Yet the artist's upbringing on Anglesey (''I didn't have
access to much visually'') and her first, faltering attempts at
expressing herself in clay, did not bode well for the career which now
flourishes with all the pazzazz of the scrolls and furbelows she
attaches to her pots.
In 1970, Pretsell turned up with her school portfolio at the art
college in Northhampton, a town chosen for its reassuring familiarity --
she had spent family holidays there. Her application for enrolment was,
she feels in retrospect, probably hindered by her portfolio. ''Though my
yellow PVC shoes and the shiny yellow mac I was wearing helped
enormously. I got in.''
Her husband to be, Peter, lectured in print-making at the art school
(''We met and were engaged within six weeks''); later, when head of the
foundation course, he came across a report written by Philomena's art
master in Anglesey. It read ''This person has no future in art
whatsoever''.
Philomena has been fighting the system ever since. ''In the USA --
where her work is in a number of private collections -- there is no
tradition of ceramics. So things are more free. Here, I don't fit in --
my work is often considered gaudy, brash and confrontational. It can be
too much for people to accept when I enter competitions.''
But fortunately there are plenty who recognise that Pretsell's
challenging, Rococo work stretches the boundaries of what is possible in
ceramics. Love it or hate it, her work pushes the concept of decorative
art to the very limits. Ten years ago, Peter Pretsell accepted a post at
Edinburgh College of Art, whereupon Philomena -- who had gained a
diploma in Foundation Studies from Northampton -- began to experiment in
the college ceramics department. ''The staff suggested I build up a
portfolio and submit an application for direct entry. I studied for
three years then did a postgraduate course.'' Having found her unique
form, Pretsell came top of her year and was rewarded with a scholarship.
During her final year she got to know the college artist-in-residence.
Todd Garner, a ceramicist and master of fine arts from Long Beach,
California, had been invited to work in Edinburgh for a term. Although
his residency finished long ago, Garner has remained in Scotland and,
with funding from Glasgow City Council's Business Development
Department, launched the country's first gallery devoted to ceramics.
The T Garner Gallery's inaugural exhibition opened on September 30 and
features the work of 25 artists including Philomena Pretsell. Oddly, it
took an accident for the fullest of expression of Pretsell's style to
emerge -- a teapot fell over and squidged. ''It seemed to emphasis the
natural movement in the clay -- it's that fluidity I'm after.'' To
achieve the desired effect she stretches the clay by banging it,
pizza-fashion, on a slab. Next, she lays papers patterns on top
according to whether it's a jug, cup or whatever. Tiny patterns are then
impressed on the clay using an Indian printing block, before it is
folded into the appropriate form. Seams are carefully worked. After
glazing, each piece is decorated with colourful Victorian scraps:
Victoriana and eighteenth-century women's costume are a strong
influence. ''I love the way a cuff is frilled and I do the same around
the neck or the base of a vase.''
It is ornamentation -- gilt tassels, ribbons, pleats or frills --
which distinguish Pretsell's work, which cloak it in fantasy and
nostalgia. But this mother of three is at pains to stress she is in no
way trying to show herself off. ''I can't stand that idea! It's just
that there's so much joy to be had in life . It's only recently I've
discovered how different I am from most people, in my tastes. I've
always loved bright colours. Maybe I've never grown up?''
* Philomena Pretsell's work can be seen at the following galleries:
The T Garner, Glasgow, September 30 -- October 31; The Open Eye,
Edinburgh, from November 4-23; Contemporary Ceramics, London, November 9
- 18, and at her workshop in Loanhead (0131 440 0751).

Pond Cottage is an acreage of weed, rot and litter, but Fay Young
intends to turn it into a Scottish horticultural paradise. In Weekend
Extra, she will report on her progress, and tell of the great gardeners
past and present, whose experience she will cheerfully plunder
IF YOU squint, the garden round Pond Cottage looks almost planned. The
stone path to the front door is lined with catmint covered with
butterflies and bees. Hastily-sown Alaska nasturtium seeds have grown
into a convincing hedge around the vegetable plot. Red-stalked spinach
contrasts cheerfully with yellow spaghetti squash plants and (as long as
you are still squinting) a fresh green semi-circular lawn is marked by
newly-planted rowan and cherry to light up autumn and spring.
But open your eyes wide and the illusion fades as a field of
approaching weeds comes into focus. A thin line separates that ''lawn''
from a hostile crop of thistles, docks, and daisies. Closer inspection
reveals a lot more weed among the grass, forcing even the heavy-duty
mower to grunt and give up the job of cutting the flowers off before
they set seed.
From this view-point you cannot even see the stretch of water, with
resident moorhens, which tempted us here in the first place. You have to
make a special trip up the lane past the pond to marvel at the grassy
glade which has been created from the neighbourhood tip of unwanted
fridges, cookers and household waste which only just failed to put us
off the idea when we bought the place two years ago.
Taming the wilderness is not for those who are impatient,
faint-hearted -- nor generally in their right mind. Osgood Mackenzie,
the man who conquered the wild north-west to create Inverewe gardens,
carried creel loads of soil to cover bare rock and waited 20 years for
Corsican pine to provide enough shelter for more tender plants to grow.
That is either patience or madness on a grand scale but in the past few
months I have been thinking of Osgood Mackenzie with renewed admiration
as I scrape stones from the soil to make paths round the house.
It takes five to 10 minutes to fill a bucket with stones, three to
four buckets to load the wheelbarrow, and perhaps five wheelbarrows to
cover a couple of square metres with a respectable layer of hand-picked
pebbles. Yet nature can cover a virgin acre of newly ploughed and
rotavated soil with a thick carpet of healthy weeds virtually overnight.
And, of course, in just a few months the grass which has been reluctant
to sprout on the lawn is coming up nicely in all the paths.
On the whole 20 years to start a garden seems like a rush job.
What are we doing here with a lifetime's work ahead as we rebuild a
derelict cottage and learn how to restore 10 acres of silted up pond and
rundown woodland? To understand why, you need to see the pond on a
frosty winter afternoon, or catch sight of the heron fishing in the
sluice stream, to find a bank of primroses above a pile of rusting
corrugate iron, or sit on a starry night with family and friends round a
bonfire in the new clearing while bats flicker above the ghosts of a
thousand old fridges.
The reason we're here is ridiculously romantic: I fell in love with
the fantasy of it all six years ago when a journalistic assignment
introduced me to the woodland gardens of the west and the walled gardens
of the east. As a weekend gardener with an allotment I knew about
digging and dreaming but I had never encountered such miracles of
imagination and sheer hard slog before.
Scotland's gardens are a monument to the heroically bonkers who give
their lives or a perfectly good day off to persuade trees and plants to
grow in places where most of them had no intention of growing before
whether on a barren hillside or in a city centre basement.
At Kellie Castle roses still climb into old apple trees just as Sir
Robert Lorimer intended. But nothing in nature stands still. Times have
changed since Sir George Campbell made his way cautiously down the
slopes at Crarae with compost in one jacket pocket and in the other an
exotic seedling from the other side of the world to add another splash
of colour to the gorge.
That was in the 1920s when pioneers were adventurous explorers who
travelled abroad to bring home exciting new plants and equally
adventurous gardeners who settled them in Scottish soil. Pioneers for
the millennium are those who seek out, nurture, and grow the shrubs and
trees which always belonged here but can be hard to find especially for
the birds, bees and mushroomy things which depend on them to survive.
Did you know there are 284 species of insect associated with the oak to
the sycamore's 15?
I believe gardens need both healthy local plants and touches of
excitement from abroad -- our American and Norwegian maples (26 insects)
should look good beside the rowan (28) and silver birch (229). I hate
spraying but a touch of glyphosate at the right time in the right place
enables the successful growth of more valuable and interesting trees and
shrubs than a monoculture of docks or thistles.
For most gardeners hopes, dreams, and ideals are constantly modified
by the practical constraints of time, money and energy.
One of the aims of this series is to discover how other gardeners
reconcile fantasy with reality and balance theory with practice whether
they are cultivating the ground on a large scale or cramming a
cosmopolitan mixture into a few pots and a window box.
Growing is big business now, plants are a new consumer market and each
gardener has increasing choices and decisions to make. But commercialism
cannot quench an essentially generous obsession and the desire to share.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Scotland's Garden Scheme is that
so many people cheerfully welcome complete strangers to trample round
their gardens on Open Days. Each of us has something to teach and always
more to learn, from mistakes as well as achievements.
In the past two years we have learned a lot at Pond Cottage with the
help of our local Farming and Wild Life adviser (unpronounceably FWAG
for short) and friendly tree specialists. A thick mulch of money could
solve a lot of problems but all kinds of grants are available when you
know where to find them: our 300 metres of mixed species hedge could not
have been planted without the 50% grant from Tayside Tree Planting
Scheme. Machinery takes the back and heartache out of hard labour: in
one day a JCB can do what a spade and wheelbarrow will never do in a
month of Saturdays and Sundays -- especially when the driver happens to
be the grandson of the last inhabitant of our cottage and has a personal
mission in filling the neighbourhood tip.
And I have learned that organic fertilisers can create problems too:
those holes round the plants have been caused by a fox driven by the
scent of bonemeal to dig for food.
But we have a great deal more to learn and my main motive in writing
the coming series of articles is to plunder the experience of gardeners
all over Scotland. I hope to explore public and private places: to go
behind the scenes at great, historic gardens; discover the weekend
retreats of working men and (probably more often) women; and meet some
of the gardeners who produce the plants we grow.
With unashamedly selfish intentions, I want to investigate orchards,
organic and mixed growers, herb and cottage gardens, parks, wild flower
meadows, water gardens, woodlands, greenhouses, polytunnels,
roof-gardens and pot plants.
I hope you will come with me.

When Russelp Hunter and Una McLean set up home together, it was always
going to be a rumbustious affair. Ann Donald dropped in on their
idiosyncratic flat and joined them in a very literary bathroom
TO HAVE the pleasure of being witness to the often unconscious stream
of banter, noisy interjections, and raucous belly laughter that
constitutes a conversation with the acting couple Russell Hunter and Una
McLean is quite an experience. Especially when the topic of animated
conversation revolves around their new joint home near Edinburgh's
Princes Street.
Having moved into the 1930s style flat in March this year, the couple
made their dramatic mark on their stately neighbours almost immediately
-- ''They're all Majors, professors, and doctors. Then there's us'' --
with an intriguing but comical sculpture that stands incongruously next
to a neighbour's quaint flower pot.
''It's by George Wylie and is called A Line Resting,'' says McLean of
the red metal line that has caused a little consternation among the
other perplexed residents passing the couple's front door. A Line
Resting is a wonderful cocoon-shaped cage structure almost 6ft tall and
rotund as a sumo wrestler that winds around like a tangled ball of wool,
and has as its ''stabilisers'' a pair of workers boots that dangle from
two metal lines resembling legs crossed in a raffish manner.
This unusual front door sentinel epitomises, to a certain extent, the
artistic raggle-taggle collection of possessions that are spread
throughout the flat. First edition books spilling out of boxes
(''Russell loves reading''), the odd John Byrne King of Rock'n'Roll
painting (''he's a good pal''), a wooden puppet propped against the wall
(''our friend George from the Glasgow Humane Society made that''), 1930s
chrome shop fittings (''from Russell's old flat conversion in the Leith
Co-op Society''), plus the odd broken photocopier, masks and memorabilia
amassed from two lifetimes in the theatre and television -- and that's
just the hall.
''We've got loads of possessions,'' sighs McLean gazing around at the
busy space. ''It's lucky that there are two large rooms downstairs
because that's where Russell's 4000 books are stored among other
things.'' In fact this 1937 flat is the newlyweds' first shared home
since their marriage in 1991 and was reached after much toing and froing
between Hunter's Leith flat and McLean's Hyndland flat. ''Each of us was
emotionally attached to their respective flats,'' says McLean, ''so we
thought, right we'll have to buy a new one that suits both of us in a
city that suits both of us.'' Hunter's preference for Edinburgh's
cultural assets and natural beauty won out eventually and the pact was
sealed after a love-at-first-sight experience on viewing their present
abode.
''We love it so much,'' enthuses McLean, ''the sun pours in to the
living room and we've got a fabulous shared garden, full of artichokes,
herbs, shrubs, raspberries, wild strawberries . . .'' At this point
Hunter playfully interrupts her to do a wicked impersonation of one of
their neighbours who takes care of the garden and seems to have the
magic touch when it comes to Kenyan roses, irises, and blue poppies.
This sparky line of conversation leads in convoluted fashion to a
dissection of the previous owner's questionable choice of, as Hunter
delicately puts it, ''utterly boggin'' bathroom toilet paper. This is
the signal to rise from our comfy living-room seats and view the
transformation that has taken place in what the couple describe as ''our
favourite room''.
''We had a war in here to get rid of that boggin' stuff,'' explains
Hunter. ''In fact the gas engineers, electricians, and plumbers were
here so often I began to think they had a crush on Una,'' he teases. The
assembled labour obviously paid off as they usher me into the revamped,
re-wallpapered, ultra-co-ordinated bathroom of black, white, chrome and
''ridd'' carpet as Hunter terms it, or ''coral'' as McLean describes it.
Apart from admiring the power shower and chrome double taps all
attention turns to the ''erudite'' choice of shower curtains.
Swishing back their proud buy Hunter comments: ''Every bathroom should
have something to read, but I don't like books in a toilet so these are
the next best thing.'' The design is composed of an amalgam of snippings
from the front covers of the world's newspapers which have been cut and
pasted together forming a jokey stretch of black and white waterproof
reading matter with all newspapers dated 31 Dec 2000.
As McLean reveals, the literary shower curtains were to have been the
piece de resistance in an entirely black and white bathroom, but
unfortunately financial restraints prevailed. ''It started off we were
going to be awfully glam and smart with plate glass and a special floor,
but we realised we couldn't afford all that so we improvised.''
Improvisation came courtesy of the chrome shopfittings from Hunter's
former flat as well as an EEC butter mountain stockpile of shower caps,
soaps, shampoos and gels ''acquired'' by Hunter on those occasions work
demands him to stay in hotels and enjoy the bathroom luxuries.
The couple also decided to make good use of their numerous art posters
as McLean explains pointing to the large geometric Mondrian that glows
in red, yellow, and blue squares over the original chrome thirties towel
heater.
It is, however, the framed Malesovic poster that elicits a joint
''Ahhh'' of appreciation from both art lovers. Entitled Lady With A
Comb, the poster is a memento from one of Hunter's reconnaissance
missions to one of Amsterdam's many museums and art galleries when he
was filming there a few years ago. He confesses that he doesn't go
anywhere without his Modigliani posters and this little known copy of
Malesovic's painting whose work he first saw at the nearby Gallery of
Modern Art.
''It was the exhibition of the Russian Avant Garde 1904-1926 two years
ago,'' he says. ''Which we both went mad for,'' interjects Una.
''Anyway,'' resumes Hunter, ''I liked it so much that I managed to get
one of the huge 22ft banners that hung outside from the columns. I had
to go to a flagmaker to get it cut down because it was so big and it's
still too big for this flat.''
Hunter has also managed to find a home for a handful of other public
displays. One is an original Andy Capp cartoon strip signed by the
artist while another most suitable one for this room is a wooden-framed
address that reads, ''Visitors are kindly requested to ask for
sittings''. This little gem has been strategically and mischievously
placed beside the toilet.
''It's from a church in Bath Street,'' smiles Hunter before quickly
dispelling any accusations of theft from the home of the Almighty. ''The
church was being stripped down to make it into a nightclub and this was
hanging outside. I think that it's perfect for any toilet.''
Another unusual bathroom decoration is a vertical shop sign that reads
''Bells Three Nuns Tobacco'' which it transpires was ''liberated'' from
its original home by none other than Billy Connolly. Hunter takes up the
story -- ''This was stolen by Billy Connolly the night before they
knocked down the last shop at Gorbals Cross. He and I drove past in a
taxi and I told him that was the shop I used to run down to every Friday
to get my mammy's fags for a week when I was a wee boy. So he said, 'Oh
well, we've got to get you a souvenir from there'. So on the way back
that night he climbed over the fence, got the arse torn out of his jeans
by a guard dog, and hauled off the sign and original frame.''
It would be safe to venture, given the colourful histories of each
object in the Hunter-McLean ''ablutions room'', that very few Scottish
bathrooms could boast such an international and eclectic collection of
''liberated'' ornamentation.

Liz Taylor peeks into a doll's house in which a minature gentleman
could live in considerable style
UNDER THE HAMMER
THIS is the tale of two very different houses which both feature in
forthcoming auction sales. The first is the largest dolls' house in the
world, Mirror Grange by name, which was commissioned by the Daily Mirror
in 1929 as part of a charity drive to raise funds for the Chailey
Heritage Home, a school and hospital for handicapped children, in
Sussex.
At that time the Daily Mirror had a very popular children's cartoon
strip featuring a dog, a penguin, and a rabbit called Pip, Squeak, and
Wilfrid, and Mirror Grange was meant to be their home. When it was
finished it also featured in the cartoon.
Pip, Squeak, and Wilfrid lived in style because their house measures
7ft wide and 8ft deep with a tower that rises to 7ft 6in. There are 12
rooms -- a dining-room, drawing-room, kitchen, scullery, stillroom,
nursery, three bedrooms, two attic rooms, and one bathroom -- it was
built in 1929, remember.
The designer Michael Ayrton devised it as a ''gentleman's residence'',
standing on a rock with its tower at one end, a flight of steps leading
to the front door, and stairs leading to the battlements. Working with
him on the creation and decoration of the house and its minutely
detailed fittings and furniture -- which were carefully made to a scale
of one inch to a foot -- were other designers: George Sheringham, an
artist, who designed the wallpapers; Grace Lovat Fraser, who was
responsible for the carpets; and Victor Hembrow, who painted the
furniture and made the ornaments.
The actual building of the house -- which was made of pine, painted
and carved to give the effect of stonework, timber, framing and
thatching -- was done in the workshop of Higgs and Hill at Lambeth, and
for their fundraising effort, the Daily Mirror had Mirror Grange taken
all round the country on top of a specially contructed lorry. After its
tour it was kept at Chailey Heritage Home but by the 1960s it had become
rather decrepit and was restored by inmates of Lewes Prison.
Because the trustees of Chailey Heritage Home want to raise funds for
the school, Mirror Grange is to be auctioned at a sale of Fine Dolls and
Teddy Bears to be held by Bonhams in London on October 19 when it is
expected to bring in around #15,000.
The second house has not such a happy tale to tell but coincidentally
it also concerns handicapped children. On October 24, Christie's are
selling the contents of Hallrule House at the Assembly Rooms in
Edinburgh's George Street.
This Roxburghshire house has been owned by the Usher family since the
beginning of the twentieth century -- since 1901, in fact. The Ushers,
of course, were the brewing family who were great benefactors to
Edinburgh where their fortune was made. It was an Usher who donated
#100,000 for the building of the Usher Hall which was completed in 1914.
The turn-of-the-century Sir Robert Usher lived at Wells, near
Hallrule, in the Borders, but on the death of his widow in 1948, the big
house was demolished and their son, Sir Stuart Usher, moved to Hallrule,
taking the bulk of the family possessions with him.
Sir Stuart Usher had two sons, both of whom were unfortunately
handicapped, and his last son, Robert, died intestate a couple of years
ago. Because of his lack of heirs and his inability to make a will, the
house and its contents have had to be auctioned.
Coming up for auction are almost 300 lots of objects of art,
furniture, porcelain, paintings, books, and silver. Among the most
choice items is a William McTaggart painting entitled Crossing the Bar
which shows people in a small boat battling against a heavy tide. Its
estimate is around #20,000.
There is also a fine George II silver baluster coffee pot by Daniel
Piers, dating from 1748 (about #2500); a pair of German art nouveau
candlesticks in the shape of sinuously dressed women (around #1500); and
a pair of early nineteenth-century Scottish oil paintings showing
Bedrule across the Rule Water and Wills House, Roxburghshire. They
should sell for between #4000 and #6000.

Forbes Masson -- actor, scriptwriter
* LAST year I went on an amazing cycling holiday from Santander to
Santiago. Mind you, at points I didn't think I would live to tell the
tale as I didn't realise that Northern Spain is one of the hilliest
regions in Europe. I remember cycling into Santiago covered in dead
flies and dirt, having just had my chain come off in a storm but it was
great fun in retrospect. Mind you I did split up with my girlfriend when
we came home and there were points where I felt I was going to explode
and shoot someone. There was one time I had a bit of a hangover, it was
pouring down and we had been cycling for hours looking for a campsite.
We were wearing these bright yellow kagouls as we cycled past all these
Spaniards standing outside a bar and they started shouting out ''quack,
quack''. That wasn't very funny.

Lady Claire MacDonald admits she could loose her noodle and dine on
pasta every day of the week
PASTA, in its many variations of shape and size, is a firm favourite
with vast numbers of people. Our family is no exception. We must eat
pasta as our main meal at least three times each week. To any of you who
are not such fanatics, such a pasta-based diet isn't nearly as
restrictive as you might imagine.
There are still those for whom pasta means macaroni cheese, but there
is such a wide variety of dishes, using an equally wide variety of foods
ranging from vegetable to fish and meat, that I believe one could eat
pasta nightly and still not exhaust the repertoire -- for a couple of
weeks, at any rate!
Various dishes dictate the most suitable shape of pasta; for example,
I would never use long pasta, like spaghetti or tagliatelle, for a pasta
salad, but would opt for any of the short shapes. While on the subject
of pasta salads, it is vital to cook the pasta in stock and, on
draining, mix the pasta with a good dressing -- do this as the pasta
cools so it absorbs the flavours of the dressing. Also, a pasta salad
needs strong-tasting ingredients -- nothing bland, like avocado, but
chopped dark olives, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, strips of smoked
chicken breast, lots of chopped fresh herbs; all these are perfect for
avoiding that bland and stodgy tendency that you can encounter in a
salad.
Pasta, if bought dried, needs to be cooked in plenty of salted boiling
water, and not for too long. Overcooked pasta has a slimy texture. It
should be cooked till it is al dente, literally ''to the tooth'', which
I interpret as having a slight bite to the texture. Check this by
sticking your thumbnail into a piece of pasta to test for tenderness; I
believe about seven minutes is about the right cooking time. But, and
I'm sure many of you have already discovered this, you can buy delicious
fresh pasta in olive-oil, in Marks and Spencers, which is cooked in its
package in a microwave oven. Life really is becoming ever simpler for
the cook who is short on time but likes to eat well!
You can also buy extremely good sauces for pasta in Marks and Spencers
(and no, I am not on the board) but I do not, personally, like the
Dolmio range of sauces -- two of our daughters love them -- because to
me there is that syrupy taste and texture of monosodium glutamate.
A plate of pasta is a satisfying meal, accompanied by salad. It can be
as simple as you like; in fact pasta can be a real last-minute fast-food
meal if you have some very good olive-oil, and some freshly grated
parmesan cheese (which, incidentally, keeps very well in the freezer).
When your pasta is cooked, drain it, toss it in olive-oil and chopped
garlic (if you like) and serve it with the Parmesan. If you have parsley
(flat-leaved for maximum flavour) chop it roughly and stir that into the
pasta with the garlic. Nothing could be simpler.
The other extreme is to make a really good Bolognese sauce, which
needs long, slow cooking, and the best ingredients.
Other quick pasta flavourings -- many of which can't really be
described as a sauce -- include crumbled blue cheese with torn-up
spinach (or rocket, in season). The heat of the pasta wilts the spinach
and there is no need for any pre-cooking of the spinach. Sauted leeks,
chopped walnuts, and crumbled creamy goats' cheese is another of my
favourite taste combinations for pasta. Whatever you are stirring into
the cooked pasta, always stir in olive-oil as soon as you drain the
pasta -- this prevents it from sticking together. I never see the logic
of adding oil to the water as it cooks, because that is no guarantee
that it won't stick together.
While talking about pasta I must remember lasagne. Fast-food purveyors
have rendered lasagne into something that the very thought of makes me
feel sick. It is such a shame. Using the Bolognese sauce recipe today,
and laying up leaves of lasagne (no need for pre-boiling of the sheets
of pasta these days) with a very good cheesy sauce makes the dish of
lasagne as it should be -- but be sure to have the cheesy sauce fairly
runny as the lasagne absorbs moisture as it cooks, and stiff sauces give
a most stodgy result.

COUNSEL for the prosecution, Mr Brian Leveson, told Winchester Crown
Court that a young girl, Caroline Owens, was thumbing a lift home one
evening in September or October 1972, when a car stopped and she was
offered a lift.
It must have appeared safe because the car was occupied by a couple.
The driver was Frederick West and his passenger Rosemary West. During
conversation on the journey she was asked if she would accept a job as
their nanny.
''That itself you may consider somewhat remarkable, given the fact
that they had met only minutes before,'' he said.
Eventually Caroline did accept the position, but stayed only a short
period of time.
During that period Mrs West had seemed over-attentative. She told
Caroline she had nice eyes and would stroke a strand of her hair. She
made a point of going into the bathroom when Caroline was in the bath.
About four weeks later, on December 6, 1972, perhaps by coincidence,
but perhaps not, Frederick and Rosemary West came across the girl again
and offered her a lift.
She was perfectly happy to accept and got into the rear of the car.
The Wests offered to drive her home.
As they left Gloucester, Mrs West -- who was in the back seat with
Caroline -- put her arm around her and started talking of sexual
matters.
She tried to kiss Caroline on the mouth and began to touch her hair
and fondle her breasts. Mr West said: ''What's her tits like?''
Mrs West then continued to sexually assault Caroline and, at a gate to
a field, the car was stopped. Mrs West was still indecently assaulting
the girl.
Mr West punched her on the face knocking her unconscious, and when
Caroline came to her hands were being secured behind her back with her
own scarf and her mouth taped to prevent her crying out.
The tape was brown carpet or masking tape, and was wrapped around and
around her face, over her mouth and ears, and around the back of her
head.
Thus gagged, she was driven back to 25 Cromwell Street, with Mrs West
holding her down and continuing the assault upon her. She was bundled
indoors and taken to the first floor front bedroom.
Mr Leveson said the tapes were cut free, Caroline was stripped naked
by both Wests and she was laid on the bed. Both Mrs West and Mr West
subjected her to a series of sexual indignities during which she was
blindfolded at times, and Mr West hit her with a leather belt. Mrs West
performed oral sex upon her and Mr West had intercourse with her.
At one time she was told: ''We will kill you and bury you under the
paving stones of Gloucester.'' She remained a prisoner all night.
They alternated between cruelty and kindness and, in spite of what had
occurred, the Wests wanted her to return to live with them and not to
tell. She saw this as her only opportunity of escape and agreed.
However, next day she left the house and reported the matter to the
police.
Both Frederick and Rosemary West were subsequently charged with
assault occasioning actual bodily harm and indecent assault. Having
pleaded guilty at a magistrates court, they were both fined.
This, he said, was highly relevant because the circumstances in which
it occurred went a long way to proving what happened to many of the
unfortunate girls buried in Cromwell Street.
The Crown contended that the jury was entitled to conclude that the
detail was replicated and repeated in many other cases. That included
the way in which the victim was assaulted and abused, stripped of
clothing, bound and, of particular significance, the manner in which she
was kept silent with adhesive tape wound around the face to form a mask
or gag.
The sexual indignities inflicted by both Wests upon the victim -- a
joint activity from start to finish, and Mrs West's sexual interest in
girls, together with the pleasure and gratification she obviously
obtained from sexually assaulting a restrained and immobile girl with
the pain, humiliation, and indignity which that involved.
Caroline had been trusted by the Wests not to report the matter. In
the event she was released and did inform.
''The Wests would not be so trusting again,'' said Mr Leveson.
''All this is material on which the Crown rely to establish that
Rosemary West participated in the sexual abuse of subsequent victims.
Such participation by itself, we surmise, leads to the conclusion of
participation in murder.''

ACCUSED mass murderer Rosemary West showed a brief moment of emotion
yesterday as a jury heard of the killings at her home.
The dark-haired mother of seven bent forward in the large wood
panelled dock to dab her eyes with a white handkerchief.
The tears came as soft spoken Crown counsel Brian Leveson, QC,
unemotionally detailed the fate of her 10 alleged victims, including her
daughter and stepdaughter.
In the hot tense court at Winchester five of the male jurors sat in
shirtsleeves intently following with their colleagues the opening.
Occasionally they gave a sideways glance at the woman said to have
joined with her husband in a campaign of sexual violence and murder.
For most of the day bespectacled Mrs West sat motionless between two
uniformed prison officers. Her black jacket was relieved by a white
open-necked blouse and the occasional glitter of her earrings and a tiny
crucifix on a thin chain below her throat.
Before them the jury had blue folders containing brief histories and
photographs of the victims in life and some photographic evidence.
The judge and legal teams followed the case on laptop computers. They
were all plugged in to a high-tech court reporting system which key
stroked the spoken word to present an on-screen text record.
Most of the spectators in the packed tiered courtroom were media
representatives. A handful of authors and court artists took up
additional seats while around 100 seats were available in overflow
annexe courtrooms which had an audiolink to the number three court.

* Glasgow-born comedian Arnold Brown lives in Hampstead, London, with
his partner Liz. Most of his work is in live performance as well as
radio and he is currently working on a children's book.
* I LOVE my food, but don't give it the respect it deserves. Liz cooks
(brilliantly). I don't. I'm not a new age man, but parasitical. Leech is
the word here.
I'm minimal on breakfast: always grapefruit or orange juice unless I
feel I've done a good or difficult gig the previous evening then I'll
have the full-frontal hotel breakfast. I'm of Jewish extraction but I
like bacon too with a poached egg on toast. I like to go to buzzy places
and observe folk. Mid-morning I go to Louis's for my croissant Maison
Berthault in Soho. Very twee.
Lunch depends on what's in the fridge if you're a leech and scavenger
like me. We only use organic or free-range ingredients at home. I'm into
soups and like wholemeal bread with hummus, yoghurt, a Cox or Golden
Delicious -- my father used to be a greengrocer in Glasgow. Afternoon, I
might end up in the Hampstead Tea Room for Earl Grey, wholemeal toast
and marmalade. What an exciting life!
Early evenings depend on Liz. She makes lovely pasta rosatos,
stir-fries, homemade onion soup with garlic, chilli and peppers, and
salads. I might have an urge for yoghurt if I'm alone in the flat. I try
to keep sugar and salt down.
Roast lamb with fresh mango chutney or shepherds pie with organic
minced lamb are my favourites. My sister in Glasgow makes me lovely
chicken soup.
I love a medium dry red wine, whisky with a bit of ice or Capella
apple juice.
My sweet tooth appreciates nice chocolate at end of meal, I snaffle
the lot before the guests. We're talking greed.
I tend to be quite spartan with food sometimes and reward myself with
it at the end of a piece of work. Food and wine are good lubricants to
discussing ideas with people. Eating out will be Indian, Greek, or
Italian. In Glasgow, I go to Cafe Gandolfi. I love the atmosphere of
smart places and hope it might rub off on me . . .

Robert McLoughlan argues that political conviction is a poor guide to
consumer choice when it comes to wine
A SURPISING number of people tell me that they are boycotting French
produce, but especially French wine, because of the nuclear tests being
carried out in the South Pacific. They are as mistaken as those who
refused to drink South African wine (unless it masquaraded as Bulgarian,
which much apparently did) in order to defeat apartheid. It is not the
inconsistency which condemns the boycotters, none of whom would dream of
boycotting Chinese exports in spite of China's commitment to nuclear
tests, for example. It is that the victims of the boycott are themselves
innocent and are being deliberately used so that their suffering may
pressure others more powerful. These are the techniques of the Gestapo
and the KGB, and any morality they may pretend is spurious.
Political conviction is a poor guide to consumer choice and I've
always felt there was enough in John Bright's argument about free trade
bringing people together, to have drunk South African wine throughout
the years when it was unfashionable to do so. Curiously enough, if
anything, South African wine has actually become better since apartheid
ended.
All of that said, drinkers who like sparklers but cannot afford
champagne should know that the Co-op still has Omar Khayyam, the
sparkling wine made in the hills behind Bombay by an Indian millionaire.
The price is just under #6.
My friend Alan Scotney, who keeps cheaper wines to see if they
improve, let me try some 1985 and 1986 recently. The '86 was the better,
but both were rather good, though they suffered a bit right at the end
of their taste from one of the grapes in their mix, the Ugni Blanc.
If Omar ever becomes wholly Chardonnay it will be much better, but it
can certainly be drunk now on grounds of value for money. Co-op outlets
seem to be the only place it can be found -- searchers will find the
Co-op has other attractions, usually inexpensive.
Value-for-money too fits the Greenpoint Chardonnay (Peckhams, #8.49)
the still Australian companion of the better known Greenpoint sparkler.
The sparkler is the only Aussie to replicate the (normal) mix of grapes
in champagne itself, and is interesting on that account as well as being
good; but the still wine is exceptionally good and will improve with
keeping.
An even cheaper Aussie with appeal is Rosemount Estate's 1994 Fume
Blanc (#5.99 from Marks and Spencer). This style of wine was pioneered
by California's Robert Mondavi but if his is better than the Rosemount
(and it is) it is also several pounds dearer.
A slightly cheaper Chardonnay from the Pays D'Oc in southern France is
Domaine de Rivoyre (at Safeways). Some friends, who tried this after the
Rosemount, pronounced it better. There's room for argument, but the
general assumption that New World wines always beat the French
competition at the lower end of the price range cannot always be
sustained.
Indeed, a fair number of topers seem to be tiring of the immediacy and
lack of subtlety they associate with the New World. They do not tire of
the price and both Australia and California can also make fine wine,
though it is not cheap either (in Australia's case some splendid wines
which an enthusiast let me try this summer seem to be unavailable here.)
Shopping around is worth while even in the case of expensive wine.
Oddbins have Latour '83 for just under #50 but Threshers want #68 for
it, according to their list. It is drinking well -- supple, deliciously
long tasting and long lasting, and better than anything I've ever
encountered from the New World. It is very dear but better at #49.99
than #68.

Sauces can make a meal, and Michael Fry has found the cookbooks that
prove it
SAUCES are really the essence of cookery, and nobody who has not
mastered the basic repertoire can claim to be a cook. This is a matter
of practicality, rather than of snobbery. Seek as we may the best and
freshest ingredients we are all, in this sublunary world, going to be
faced from time to time with a bit of dull fish or defrosted meat, or
perhaps with some game that has got a bit too high. By making a good
sauce, you can still turn them into an occasion rather than a penance.
You can also spend much of the occasion arguing about sauces, as is
regularly done in civilised countries that love their food. How exactly
is this one or that one to be defined? Classically, on my interpretation
at least, there are three main families of sauce. There are white sauces
and brown sauces, for which the technique of composition is really the
same, though the ingredients are different. Then there is the quite
separate family of emulsified sauces.
But Escoffier, who lists 205 sauces altogether, puts Hollandaise in
with Mornay and Soubise, the essential distinction being in his mind
between hot and cold.
You can argue about all this till the cows come home, as is well
illustrated in the wholly different classification given in the book on
sauces by Sonia Stevenson, with recipes from her restaurant in Devon,
the Horn of Plenty. She ignores white sauce, and for brown sauce offers
some slightly startling ideas, like making crab bisque with it, or a
souffle of sole quenelles.
She also recognises emulsified sauces which she just calls, reasonably
enough, egg sauces. She suggests an amazingly quick and easy way to make
a base for all of them. She often adds them to soups, and of course
enlivens fish and vegetables with them.
But then she has two other classes of sauce, unacknowledged in
classical cuisine because they are not sauces in the strict sense. One
is made simply by boiling cream so that it gradually thickens in
consistency, and can be added to various types of dish according to its
thickness. At its thickest it turns into an emulsion, for coating meat
or vegetables.
Finally she gives the almost as simple category of sugar sauces, made
by boiling sugar and water together till clear. This has possible uses
well beyond desserts, for instance, in tomato soup, in vinaigrettes, in
oniony dishes, or as an accompaniment to pork and kidneys. Altogether I
found this cookbook most intriguing.
There is no better proof of what I said at the beginning about sauces
than their prevalence in Asian cuisines, originally to vary a monotonous
peasant diet. The world of curries grew up as Indians got tired of just
shovelling rice in their mouths and perhaps chewing an onion or two.
I find European vegetarian dishes pretty boring on the whole, but
Shehzad Husain's cookbook demonstrates the richness of their Indian
counterparts. There are separate sections on pulses, rice, and breads,
with a much longer one on curry accompaniments, showing how you can vary
the effect by emphasising one spice rather than another. The sauce, it
cannot be said too often, makes all the difference.
Thai cuisine depends a good deal on a fishy sauce called Nam Pla,
which is made by allowing shrimps to rot, then drawing off the resultant
fluid. Vatcharin Bhumichitr runs a Thai restaurant in London, and
recently came to give a demonstration in Edinburgh, with a particularly
memorable fish recipe. But an enthusiast for doing it yourself might
have a good deal of difficulty in finding the more mysterious
ingredients.

The coaches may be old and the compartments as cramped as on any train
but, Conrad Wilson believes, when they dish out the lobster lunch on the
Orient Express, there are few places he'd rather be
Luxurious living: all meals -- not least the lobster lunch, with
perfectly judged scrambled eggs and smoked salmon as a starter -- are
included in the Orient Express deal, as is the sheer pleasure of
travelling in a train with every carriage an art deco temple of gleaming
lacquer, polished wood, exquisite glass, and elegant marquetry. In the
restaurant-cars, each of them differently designed, you sit on real
dining-chairs and in the bar on real sofas for the trip from Northern
Italy to London.
NO matter how bad the food or how high the price, railway meals retain
a perhaps ridiculous yet wholly understandable allure that dates back to
the very first time a passenger raised a knife and fork amid
romantically unrolling scenery. Even today shrunken British Rail shows
some awareness of this, and attempts to maintain the tradition, though
there is no doubt that the train as a gourmet experience -- of the sort
that once enabled this writer to savour a dinner of roast quail with the
violinist Leonard Friendman in a French restaurant-car swaying
unhurriedly through the sunset from Paris St Lazare to Caen -- has
become largely a false hope.
Faster trains, alas, mean faster meals. France's famed TGV, for
instance, likes to pretend it's a plane, serving plastic airline food
instead of the riches of the regions through which it speeds. Italy's
smooth, sleek Pendolino, on its four-hour trip from Milan to Rome,
likewise employs the equivalent of air stewardesses to bring trays of
cold meat along its open-plan aisles. Though undeniably better than the
misleadingly smart orange buffet cars on other Italian expresses with
their microwave pasta and soggy buns, it scarcely replaces the more
stately restaurant-cars that are struggling to survive on Italy's
otherwise excellent inter-city network.
These, as I was relieved to confirm last week, still contrive to serve
a four-course meal, with a token glass of Spumante and a half-bottle of
good Italian wine, for about #20 per person which, by railway standards,
is quite impressive.
The landscapes between Florence and Bologna dramatically improve any
meal, and though what we were served bore only a vague resemblance to
what was printed on the menus, there were portions of sedani (a ridged
macaroni-like pasta) with a genuine tomato sauce, veal with zucchini and
fresh herbs, three sorts of Italian cheese and fresh fruit -- simple
food but satisfying enough, served with flair by one of the Vittorio de
Sica-like waiters, complete with twirled moustache still to be found on
Italian trains.
But for evidence of what railway eating used to be like, you have to
join the revamped Venice-Simplon Orient Express, as I was lucky enough
to do earlier this year on its majestic progress through Northern Italy,
Austria, Switzerland, and France to its final destination, some 30 hours
later, in London.
Though it is possible -- at a price -- to do just part of the journey,
it would be foolish to settle for anything less than the complete
experience, incorporating lunch and afternoon tea as the train sweeps
through the Italian and Austrian Alps, dinner in crepuscular valleys
between Innsbruck and Lake Constance, zizz between Zurich and Paris, a
French breakfast and a glimpse of crates of lobsters waiting to be
brought on board at the Gare de l'Est in preparation for the lobster
lunch that is the piece de resistance between Paris and Boulogne.
Thereafter England contributes the daintiest of afternoon teas, and
Cologne soap with which to wash your hands, on the final leg between
Folkestone and Victoria.
Trips of this sort do not come cheaply, and there are plenty of
tempting overheads. But the package -- for that is what it amounts to --
throws in quite a lot for #940, which entitles you to a shared
(two-berth) sleeping cabin and an Alitalia outward flight from London to
Venice (the itinerary can also be reversed, though that would mean
sleeping through some of the best scenery). All meals -- not least that
lobster lunch, with perfectly judged scrambled eggs and smoked salmon as
a starter -- are included, as is the sheer pleasure of travelling in a
train every carriage of which is an art deco temple of gleaming lacquer,
polished wood, exquisite glass, and elegant marquetry.
In the restaurant-cars, each of them differently designed, you sit on
real dining-chairs, and in the bar on real sofas.
Not everything, however, is ideal. Stray outside the cost of what is
included, and there are some formidable surcharges. Wine comes at posh
hotel prices. A journalist colleague, handing the barman a 50,000 lira
note (more than #20) for a very small round of very ordinary drinks, was
promptly asked to hand over another.
Nor do first-class prices fully buy first-class comfort. For all its
beauty as a brilliantly renovated art piece, the Orient Express is an
old train. It is bumpy and noisy. It trundles through tunnels, making
conversation difficult and obscuring the sound of the cocktail bar
pianist (none other, on my particular trip, than Jan Latham Koenig,
working his passage back to London after a conducting stint in Austria).
And the sleeping berths, in spite of their fine upholstery and wooden
wash cabinets, are as cramped as any others. There are no showers (a
virtue of the train's Scottish rival) and the WC is at the end of the
corridor.
Who travels on today's Orient Express? None of Graham Greene's spies,
that's for sure, though the beaming Japanese, the decrepit Americans,
the bashful English honeymooners and quarrelsome celebrants of silver
weddings provide scope for some piquantly Greenian social observations.

A day at the races proved more of a gamble than ANVAR KHAN expected
when she found herself unexpectedly in the fashion stakes
I RECENTLY had an interesting weekend. This becomes more unusual. I
went out and did things instead of cocooning with the papers and a few
bottles. I sang three songs at the Friday-night karaoke with aplomb, and
was one of the finalists of the Best Dressed Lady competition at
Hamilton races on the Sunday.
I'd simply dressed-up for fun. But I was almost immediately accosted
with the invitation to join other ''finalists'' in the winner's
enclosure at 3.30pm. What was expected to be a relaxing day losing money
on the horses, changed.
Okay, so I was flattered. I was wearing a red trouser suit and a peach
cashmere coat and a gi-normous black hat (not everybody's cup of tea but
you'd be amazed as to how much you can carry off if you try).
So instead of studying the form I found myself in the loos powdering
and painting, while reassuring myself that it was the taking part, not
the winning, that counted. Yeah right, so that's why I was there at the
racetrack gambling in the first place.
Anyway, I and the six other women (20 had been invited to compete, but
most chickened out or knew better) minced down the path towards the
aptly-named ''Weighing Room'' right on cue.
In fact, there are pictures circulating Glasgow with lady finalists
posing outside the ''Weighing Room'' as if we, not the jockeys, had been
vetted for excess fat. The winners enclosure became an arena, as the
crowds drew in.
I saw an amphitheatre of expectant faces, and settled on the one
waving his card. (It's all right, I live with him.)
''I'm not a horse,'' volunteered the future winner, in her M&amp;S office
wear, when rumours grew that we would have to walk around the coop, like
the prize equine as people observed our attire.
A glamorous blonde had already decided that she was going to give it a
serious go. She slipped off a black, sparkly jacket to reveal long limbs
encased in white, body hair on a golden tan, and a slinky, mink-grey,
strappy dress. ''Oh come on,'' said the future winner, ''that's not
fair.''
''Can you just walk about a bit?'' coaxed the PR, as we huddled on the
porch. The prize was a trip for two to Monte Carlo, so we braved it,
shuffling from one end of the path to the other, to congest as if
waiting for a bus, then back again.
''I can't believe I'm doing this'' hissed the more dignified, caught
out on an act of kindness and good-spirit.
The judges cogitated and whispered but the newspaper editor's wife had
the final say. The lady in red squealed as she was pointed out. She had
to be pointed out, as ''lady in red'' was announced because the other
lady in red was me.
''You must be joking,'' murmured the crowd, upset with the decision.
We applauded politely, after all, a meatmarket is okay as long as it's
for charity.

SCOTTISHPOWER'S hostile #1100m bid for the English electricity company
Manweb succeeded yesterday, but by a narrower margin than many had
expected.
It gained control of 60% of Manweb after a bitter two-month takeover
battle. Chief executive Ian Robinson said he was ''delighted''.
Most Manweb shareholders who resisted the bid are now expected to
sell.
The English Company, which distributes power in Merseyside and North
Wales, resisted ScottishPower's takeover to the bitter end, with a
handful of large shareholders, including insurance giant Prudential,
which owns 8.5%, rejecting the bid.
However, other shareholders owning 32% of Manweb signalled their
acceptance of the offer by yesterday's 1pm deadline, providing
ScottishPower, with control of 60% of the Chester-based company. It had
already built up a 28% stake in Manweb by buying shares on the open
market,
Manweb chief executive John Roberts, who constantly derided the
ScottishPower bid as ''mean'', said the outcome was a disappointment.
Manweb tried to buy the loyalty of its shareholders by promising them
a benefits package worth 550p per share if they rejected the
ScottishPower bid.
When this strategy showed little sign of working, it tried to
negotiate an alternative takeover deal with the US power company,
PacifiCorp. Talks with this white knight collapsed on September 28 after
dragging on for 10 days, making the takeover by ScottishPower all but
inevitable.
ScottishPower executives will meet Manweb directors on Monday to
discuss the transfer of control. A team of ScottishPower managers,
headed by corporate resources director Mike Kinski, is already waiting
to take over at the Chester headquarters.
There will then be a few months for the Scottish company to get the
feel of its acquisition before implementing promised measures to cut
costs and improve efficiency.
City analysts say Manweb's 3000 workforce may be halved over the next
few years. The axe will probably fall first on its headquarters, where
700 work. It will be drastically slimmed down to avoid duplication with
ScottishPower's headquarters in Glasgow.

SCOTTISH Opera yesterday announced plans to appeal directly to the
Secretary of State for Scotland to bail it out of a cash crisis which is
forcing it to go part-time.
Faced with a current deficit of #150,000, it claims it needs an
increase of #750,000 a year to stand still, and #1.25m a year to match
the budget of Welsh National Opera and flourish throughout Scotland.
It also said it would be lobbying for a change in the rules governing
the distribution of national lottery grants to the arts, to allow these
funds to go not only to capital projects, but also towards
revenue-funding of performing arts.
However, the Earl of Lindsay, the Scottish Office Minister with
responsibility for the arts, yesterday ruled out any special help for
Scottish Opera.
He said: ''It is for the Scottish Arts Council to determine funding
priorities, as it distributes taxpayers' money to arts organisations in
Scotland.''
A campaign urging opera-loving members of the public to lobby the
Scottish Office on Scottish Opera's behalf will be launched next week.
Meanwhile, in order to act within its legal obligations and balance
its books, the company's board has opted to introduce flexible contracts
and pay cuts, to stop its touring in England, and to cut its operation
to nine months of the year.
This would mean that Scottish Opera would not be able to perform at
the Edinburgh Festival.
Emphasising that this option was only reluctantly chosen, the
company's general director, Mr Richard Jarman, said that going part-time
was the lesser of two evils, and warned that once Scottish Opera had set
a precedent, other regional opera companies might well be forced to
follow suit.
Mr Sandy Orr, chairman of Scottish Opera, told a press conference at
the company's headquarters in Elmbank Street, Glasgow, that the board
had rejected unanimously the option of disbanding its own orchestra as a
way of saving money -- as was proposed in a report published yesterday
by a committee chaired by Sir Lewis Robertson. The committee looked at
whether any forms of collaboration with Scotland's other major
orchestras would solve Scottish Opera's problems.
The collaboration working group concluded the only feasible option, in
the light of current Government funding to the Scottish Arts Council,
was to disband Scottish Opera's orchestra, with the opera relying on the
bought-in services of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Royal
Scottish National Orchestra, and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.
Mr Orr said this had been rejected for a number of reasons:
* It would not deliver artistic consistency to the company's work, and
Scottish Opera would not be able to attract a music director of any
substance without an orchestra to direct.
* It did not solve Scottish Opera's financial problems alone, and
would need to be accompanied by further cuts in the programming, thus
heading to a part-time company by another route.
* The implementation of the proposal was not likely to be achieved,
given the protracted industrial action that it would trigger, and the
pressure that would be exerted on the other managements involved.
* Scottish Opera would lose control of a vital part of its operation,
with serious implications on the maintenance of artistic standards.
Mr Orr said he was appealing to Mr Forsyth, ''a man recognised for his
belief in Scottish excellence'', to secure the future of Scottish Opera.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Office said that the previous Scottish
Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, had given a one-off payment of #500,000 to help
Scottish Opera out of a previous financial crisis, on the condition that
it kept within its budget.
''In the current climate of public expenditure, everyone is on a tight
budget -- hospitals, Government departments, local authorities, opera
companies, or whatever, and that is real life. It (Scottish Opera) has
to live within its budget,'' she said.
If the company wanted to lobby the Department of National Heritage,
that was its choice, she said. The issue was already being discussed in
the medical charity context, she added.
Mr Orr said the opera company was a national one and had to perform at
a certain level of quality.
''Without the control of the core of orchestral quality, I think this
company would be set on a downward path,'' he said.
However, by going part-time the company would inevitably be
downgraded. Staff members and board members were likely to resign in the
light of such a move, he warned.
Mr Orr added that there was no financial resource problem for the arts
in Scotland, as #29m was available this year from national lottery
funds. This compared with the #25m budget of the Scottish Arts Council,
but the lottery funds were ''ring-fenced'' for capital projects.
''You can get money for film, but not for opera or orchestras. I think
this is ludicrous.
''It will be totally incomprehensible to future generations that large
sums would be spent on buildings, while arts companies that could help
fill them were allowed to wither,'' he said.
However, the music director of the Scottish Arts Council, Mr Matthew
Rooke, warned that unless there was a carefully negotiated change to
lottery funding regulations, such a move might allow the Government to
reduce its core funding in the arts, and the SAC would oppose that.
He added that there was a clear demand for capital projects in
Scotland.

John Fowler meets a Glasgow scientist for whom a grisly find in the
Alps was a peak of opportunity
WHEN a large package with an Innsbruck postmark landed on Dr Jim
Dickson's desk last year he instantly knew what it was. This was
Dickson's share in old Otzi the Iceman. Not that the contents of the
parcel -- 47 vials containing tiny scraps and fibres, some less than a
millimetre long -- would have meant anything to most people. But to
Dickson they were priceless.
These morsels of vegetation were bits of moss and liverwort washed
from Otzi's clothing, and with luck they would provide a clue to where
he came from before his death high in the Tirolean Alps more than 5000
years ago. Dickson will tell of his findings -- and some details of
Otzi's life history -- in a public lecture at Glasgow University on
Tuesday.
Otzi was found by Frau Simon and her husband making their way to a
mountain hut in Austria in September 1991. They mistook him for a
climber killed in a mountain accident and frozen in the glacier, not an
uncommon Alpine event. The hut is only 15 minutes walk away, so
thousands of climbers must have passed the scene unaware of what lurked
in the ice.
In fact at first the discovery of the almost perfectly preserved body
was the subject of a police investigation. When the power drill operated
by an Austrian policeman attempting to hack Otzi out skidded, it
destroyed the rectum and with it contents of absorbing interest to
science.
The head and shoulders, leathery and brown, stuck out from the ice in
a rock gully on the fringe of a glacier in which Otzi had been entombed
throughout the ages. There seemed to be a wound on his skull. At that
stage it was not even certain that he was a man, and because in his
emaciated condition he looked frail and delicate, Frau Simon assumed the
body was a woman's.
The wizened nature of his genitals -- revealed once the body had been
recovered -- at first caused some doubt on that score, but man he was. A
journalist named him Otzi because he was found near the Otztal valley
which leads to the Austrian border with Italy, and the name stuck.
The following year Dickson, attending an international conference, met
scientists working on the Otzi case. ''I asked casually if any mosses
had been found,'' he says. ''Time passed, and then this box arrived.''
Dickson is a botanist (best known to the public for his book Wild
Plants of Glasgow, a fascinating account of exotic species to be found
growing wild in the city) specialising in early plant life. As a
research student at Cambridge under the famous Professor Harry Godwin,
he wrote his thesis on mosses of the Ice Ages, and he later published a
book on the same subject. Once the remnants of Otzi's clothing had been
meticulously examined and fragments of moss washed from them, it was
clear that Dickson was the man to analyse them. The evidence was
desptached to his lab in Glasgow University.
It says much for the care taken over Otzi that such minute particles
could be saved. ''What he was wearing was just a bundle of sodden
rags,'' says Dickson. ''It wasn't even clear at first that they were
clothes.''
Since then he has supplemented his work in Glasgow with four periods
of study at Innsbruck, most recently last month , and he has visited the
site where Otzi lay at 3210 metres (some 10,400 feet) above sea level.
''You have to walk across the glacier to get there,'' says Dickson.
''He froze to death in a rock hollow and was trapped under the snow and
ice. Presumably he died in late summer or early autumn and was buried by
snow before the ravens or lammergeiers could eat him. It's almost
unbelievable.''
Most of the 30-odd specimens of moss and liverwort examined by Dickson
are still found in high Alpine areas and therefore could have adhered to
Otzi's shoes, leggings, cape, or bearskin cap near where he collapsed
from cold, hunger or fatigue. But half a dozen are lowland woodland
plants rarely able to survive above the treeline, considerably below the
spot where Otzi succumbed.
''We've plotted where they grow now,'' he says. ''No-one thinks he
came from a long way off.'' Thus the evidence from these and other items
seems to indicate that Otzi set out from a settlement only about 20
kilometres to the south, in Italy.
This has some significance for another complication in the Otzi case.
When found, Otzi was assumed to be in Austria. Further investigation
proved that he was 90 metres south of the border in Italy. Some delicate
negotiations over the final resting place of the remains may be in
prospect -- but that's another story.
* Dr J H Dickson will give the Goodfellow lecture on Otzi the Iceman's
Last Journey, Clues from Plants, in the Boyd Orr Building, Glasgow
University, at 7.30pm on Tuesday. Public admission #2.

The 'mither tongue' has had a rough ride over Scotland's centuries of
nationhood, but Dr Anne KIng argues that a new breed of writers may
succeed in shifting it from the realms of Oor Wullie's bucket and out
into the world
SCOTS has of late been hitting the headlines. James Kelman and the
Booker (how late it was, how late it was indeed!). Trainspotting at last
released by Irvine Welsh from its associations of coorying in with
notebook, pencil, and flask and happing up with anorak hood. People
write about Scots in the papers. They proclaim its ''mither tongue''
status and its fitness for all linguistic purposes -- or they deny its
relevance, or even existence.
Sometimes they wax vitriolic about the gobfuls of Glasgow ''slang''
that assault viewers from TV screens and sometimes they wax lyrical
about the lilting ''good Scots'' in North-east fishing villages. This
''good'' Scots, and its synthetic ''Lallans'' relative, do receive some
(all too) serious media attention: usually in the context of a heritage
industry which wants to preserve demotic speech in some kind of
linguistic aspic.
Everybody seems to feel strongly about Scots, whatever their view, but
very few know much about its history or character, even those who speak
it.
First things first. Scots is not linguistically related to Gaelic.
Indeed, in the medieval period Gaelic was held in very low esteem by
speakers of Scots -- Dunbar in his Flyting of Kennedie (who spoke
Gaelic) claimed: ''A lawland erse wald mak a bettir nois!'' Neither is
Scots a corrupt form of Standard English.
True, it began life in the eighth century as the most northerly branch
of Northumbrian Old English at a time when Scotland was a multi-lingual
country populated by Picts, Cumbrians, and Gaels. But from its first
toehold in the South-east of Scotland, brute force and negotiation
allowed Scots to become, by the mid-fourteenth century, the dominant
language spoken in Lowland and North-east Scotland by everyone from the
king downwards.
From then on, Scots was culturally sophisticated and linguistically
independent -- a standard language. It possessed, and still does, many
linguistic characteristics that distinguished it from the standard
Southern English contemporary in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation
(so hoose and not house, gie and not give).
Scots was a potent symbol of national identity -- ''the language of
Scottis natioun''. Like the culture and society it served, till the
seventeenth century, Scots was outward-looking and eclectic in its
make-up. Much of its vocabulary, for instance, was borrowed from
European languages like French, Norse, Dutch and, peculiarly to Scots,
Gaelic. This includes surprises like those culturally-iconic words
Hogmanay, tartan, and haggis (from French), kilt (Norse) and whisky
(Gaelic) -- particularly apt since most of today's malt whisky
distilleries are to be found in the North-east of Scotland, which was
originally Gaelic-speaking territory).
Events of the next two centuries were to blur this linguistic picture
considerably. After the Reformation, Scottish people learnt to read and
heard sermons from the Geneva Bible in Southern English -- there was no
Scots translation in print.
The Union of the Crowns (that apparent lifeline for famine-ridden and
war-torn seventeenth-century Scotland) presented irresistible
opportunities for enterprising Scots businessmen and would-be social
climbers. It meant, however, familiarising themselves with English, to
the detriment of Scots. Where literature was concerned, the Union opened
up a wider market for the writings of Scottish poets if they wrote in
English and not Scots.
By means such as these, the previously strong links between the Scots
language, Scottish culture, and national identity were weakened. No
longer was it the language used by all classes in all circumstances;
English started to take its place as the formal, most prestigious
language, and the status of Scots in society was correspondingly
lowered.
Because most Scots had never seen their language written down, those
few who now learnt to read for the first time had little inkling that it
was English, and not Scots, they were being taught. Most of the books
available in print -- formal works like histories, religious writings,
poetry -- were in English, or, at best, rather heavily anglicised Scots.
So began the dissociation of Scots from an all-purpose, standard written
language.
Scots had hit the headlines for the first time in the eighteenth
century -- quite spectacularly. The Union of the Parliaments, the
Enlightenment, ''Augustanism'', ''Sentimentality'' and ''Romanticism''
forced Scots to confront the issues of national identity and good, and
society and the individual. Language use was salient to these difficult
questions, and was also much affected by them.
Burns, archetypical eighteenth-century figure and ''SuperScot'',
astutely kept a foot in both linguistic camps that sprang up. He wrote
sometimes in Augustan English. This fitted the linguistic prescriptions
of purity, correctness, refinement, and propriety which, adopted from
Southern England, were promoted by the aristocrats and intellectuals who
peopled the socially and culturally brilliant circles of the
Enlightenment. ''Augustan'' tenets had persuaded these ''improvers''
that Scots was barbarous, ''vulgar'', and provincial.
So, subjecting themselves to elocutionary tortures and hard linguistic
labour, they tried to rid their speech and writing of giveaway Scots
features and replace them with English ones. Their attempts met with
only partial success: spoken Standard English was rarely heard in
Scotland and visiting elocution teachers commonly had regional accents
(like the actor Sheridan's father who spoke with a strong Dublin
accent). Inadequate descriptions in books meant the affected (in both
senses) Scots frequently blundered by hyper-correcting, and produced
surrealistic statements such as ''McTavish was seen in the High Street
carrying a clock (cloak!) on his arm.''
Writing was more easily anglicised, though books listing Scotticisms
of vocabulary and grammar and their Standard English substitutes often
gave poor recommendations. Genuine Scots usages, like What's yon?
(''asked in allusion to something in the distance''), to be replaced
with What is that distant object?, appear beside non-Scots ones: Give me
a clean glass -- this earns the author's scornful reproach: ''Leave out
clean which is unnecessary, as you would scarcely ask for a 'dirty'
glass''.
As will be obvious to anyone listening to speakers in Scotland today,
this attempted ''linguicide'' of Scots was not entirely successful. It
gave rise to Scottish Standard English -- a blend of Standard English
and Scots -- which has, since the eighteenth century, been spoken by the
''middle'' classes (and now too by Scots dialect speakers who code-drift
into it when formal circumstances require).
For writing, Standard English is used with various Scots grammatical
features and vocabulary (The glaikit lassie had a wee greet to herself
when the tattie-bogle she had made cowped and crashed in the rowan
tree). The ''linguicide'' also failed because most of the Scottish
population were largely untouched by the linguistic ''improvements'' --
they carried on speaking their variations of regional dialects of Scots
-- and still do.
Burns wrote only one letter (that survives) in Scots. Both this and
the ''samzidat'' The Merry Muses of Caledonia are in a broader, racier,
and more sustained Scots than we find in his poems. This, and the
''sprinkling'' of Scots in his songs, was, however, sufficient to align
his outlook with those who were influenced by the ''Sentimental'' and
''Romantic'' movements and ensure that his other foot was placed in the
remains of the second camp.
These campers had been happier than the ''improvers''. They too were
culturally and politically powerful, but had Episcopalian, Jacobite, and
antiquarian leanings and included the writer Allan Ramsay, the printer
Thomas Ruddiman, and James Watson, who collected medieval Scots poetry
and traditional songs.
Burns had inherited from this proudly Scottish circle one model of
literary Scots (his other came from Fergusson) as well as a tradition of
written Scots, albeit one confined to song or poetry in lowly, comic, or
sentimental genres.
A diminished Scots shuffled its way through the nineteenth century.
Stevenson carried on the Burnsian written tradition in his poetry but,
along with Scott, extended its use to set pieces in prose fiction,
usually spoken by old, uneducated, rural, comic, and often female,
characters. Kailyard authors confined their implausible, synthetic Scots
to dialogue, parentheses, and glosses.
Scotland under the Empire no longer had its own independent culture,
but an ''official'' one had been imposed on it based on English ideas of
Scottishness, its icons Balmorality, tartanry, militarism, bagpipes, and
blended whisky. Mainstream Scots poetry and prose, steeped in maudlin
nostalgia, complacency, and banality, pandered to this image.
The low status of Scots persisted -- it was fit only for sentimental
and couthy subjects or for poking fun at. Witness Harry Lauder's
phenomenal success in the next century as the professional, red-nosed,
whisky-sodden, bekilted Scotsman singing mawkish Scottish songs.
But Scots, people and language, still possessed several vital sparks.
The local (identity and speech) now began asserting itself under threat
of extinction by officialdom -- Empire and attitudes, the Scottish
Education Department's promotion, from the 1870s, of English (and
definitely not Scots) in the classrooms -- industrialisation and
urbanisation.
Scots bounced again into the headlines and journals that printed
articles and poems by ''working'' and ''lower middle'' class male -- and
female writers. This Scots was new and (more) ''real''. Closely
reflecting local rural and -- a new development -- urban dialect, it
showed itself capable of describing actuality -- contemporary social and
industrial change, science, love and philosophy. There were other
reactions to the perceived threat: linguists recorded dialect speech
(before it disappeared!) and dictionaries of Scots were published.
This linguistic ''lepidoptery'' caught the attention of writers like
Hugh MacDiarmid who responded by creating a synthetic Scots --
''Lallans'' -- intended as a classical, standard Scots for a world-class
literature. Its ingredients, obsolete words trawled for in dictionaries
and medieval Scots literature, words and grammar from several rural
dialects, made it artificial, remote from real life -- a kind of
''cuddly toy'' Scots -- and unsuitable really for anything other than
poetry (its main use today).
Headline-hitting continues. It is pleasing to see that Scots is now
being acknowledged as vital -- in both senses -- and that the outrage of
Scots like the poet Tom Leonard (''I just felt that the voice in my
mouth wasn't being represented'') is being responded to. The Concise
Scots Dictionary is a best-seller. Scots is officially registered as a
lesser-used language with the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages,
which has commissioned a booklet on Scots for distribution throughout
the EU countries.
Interest in Scots is high in the United States, Germany, Italy, and
Japan. Recent Scottish Office Education Department 5-14 Guidelines
recommend teachers to encourage an awareness and use of Scots by school
children. To help with this, the Scottish Consultative Council on the
Curriculum is producing a resource package of teaching materials (The
Kist). In Edinburgh University, the first ever first-level course on
Scots and Scottish English (taught in the Department of English
Language) is now in its third successful year. The department also
organises an annual lecture on Scots, sponsored by the Scotch Malt
Whisky Society -- past speakers have included Jack Aitken and William
McIlvanney. This year's speaker is Liz Lochhead.
There is still a long way to go, however. The acknowledgement of Scots
needs now to be followed by an acceptance of it for what it is -- a
language without official status, but with at least nine different
dialect areas; several written varieties -- Lallans, Sunday Post Scots,
and Central Scots dialect (Liz Lochhead, Bill Herbert); a tremendously
flexible, vigorous language whose speakers drift into English and back
to Scots with ease.
Scots, like all minority languages, is affected by media and American
English influence, but is thriving. While maintaining its base, it loses
and acquires words as all living languages do. Not many Scots these days
have, or even want, to know what 'a daimen icker in a thrave' is, but
they create new words where needed, eg: sitooterie (patio),
cahoutchie-padlock (condom), and gouchin or vegging (sitting about
hungover and tired in a pub).
The work of writers like Tom Leonard and James Kelman has raised
public awareness of Scots and done a lot to move it beyond ''Oor
Wullie's'' pail and out into today's Scotland. But perceptions of Scots
will only change with wider public access to it, and a greater
appreciation of it in all its variety and vitality.

* WELCOME to the TENTH dimension . . . which sounds like the Twilight
Zone, and not unexpectedly coincides with Friday the 13th.
Gobbledegook it may sound, but what was once outlandish speculation
could be closer to reality than we imagine. All will be explained in
Edinburgh on Friday when the author of the first popular book on
Hyperspace talks on his subject.
Professor Michio Kaku will be in the Appleton Tower, George Square, on
Friday to take an audience on a scientific Odyssey through parallel
universes, time warps, and the tenth dimension.
Kaku, an expert on the kind of space which is hardly comprehensible,
will be peeling back the layers of theoretical physics to give
credibility to those ideas, like the possibility of time travel, and
whether there really are other dimensions. Maybe he will even explain
how Mr Sulu gets the Enterprise to warp factor nine and how Scottie
beams folk aboard.
Tickets for this spaced-out event are free and available from
University of Edinburgh Information services on 0131 650 2246.
Another hi-tech jamboree, the Institute of Physics Annual Congress is
scheduled for Telford in April next year. The programme of scientific
conferences will cover recent developments including silicon sensors and
the physics of musical instruments and all the physics fields from
computational to medical, and statistical to mechanical.
The exhibition will also showcase the latest in equipment and
materials including optics and lasers, semi-conducting and cryogenics.
One attraction will be a new display on physics where the motor car of
the future will be unveiled. Top scientists will give lectures, and
explanations will be given of the ways physics can be applied for wealth
creation. Hopefully the cabinet will beam aboard that one.
* INFOTEK OmniMedia has launched a new CD-ROM Aladdin cave of toys. It
is a ''virtual'' toyshop, billed as the greatest on earth. The CD lets
kids click on whatever toys take their fancy and they are taken into
games, exercises, and puzzles and even songs and educational lessons.
The virtual toyshop CD runs on Windows and AppleMac and will cost
about #30. For younger users, the problems of boredom should be
eliminated. A virtual games host leads them through the range.
Apart from being a toy store, the system covers five science topics on
the national curriculum, dressed up as fun. While they may not know they
are learning, parents can later check to see which areas kids used and
how they've performed. Other activities include singing and painting and
the old Blue Peter game of making toys from household objects.
* THE Scottish pine timber industry has got the blues thanks to a bug
with dirty feet. Once pine trees are felled, the Forestry Commission
tells us, they are prey to an attack of fungi which stains the wood a
blue colour. The tint doesn't affect the performance or strength of the
timber, but reduces market value.
The bluestain fungi is sometimes carried on the feet of bark beetles
which get into the wood after it's been felled, but it also infects sawn
timber where the beetles are absent and it was thought to be an airborne
affliction which would be difficult to battle.
Now research funded by the forest products branch has shown that the
infection is transported by other insects, particularly tiny mites, and
not by air flow. The knowledge of the insectile vector gives the
researchers pointers to possible control methods which might save the
greenwoods from turning blue.
Not all fungus is bad, however. Some actually live symbiotically with
trees and provide vital nutrients. Others are valuable because of their
rarity, as the Duke of Edinburgh has discovered after his decision to
fell ancient oaks in Windsor Great Park.
The British Mycological Society, friends of the fungus, is concerned
at the destruction of one of the handful of trees on which a rare
bracket fungus can be found in Britain.
The fungus only grows on very old trees which are becoming
increasingly rare and the bracket fungus, Phelinus Robustus, is on the
list of endangered fungi species. The Duke has been asked not to fell
the phelinus bearer.

* AFTER the warmest, sunniest summer in years and the prospect of
hotter summers to come if the global warm-ongers are correct, here's a
handy gadget for sun worshippers who'd rather not be fried by their
deity.
It's a Sunwatch which incorporates an ultra-violet radiation detector
to monitor the amount of harmful light being absorbed by the skin. Worn
as a watch and used in conjunction with a simple analyser to identify
the type of skin, it beeps a warning when enough is enough.
Sunbathers and outdoors types enter their skin type and the protection
factor of suntan lotion, it calculates the safe amount of time in the
sun and when to stay out of the direct rays altogether. In automatic
mode the Sunwatch continually monitors UV rays and updates its
calculation when levels vary.
Developed by Environment Canada, an agency of the Canadian Government,
the UV index is apparently becoming an international measurement of
ultraviolet intensity as concern about the harmful effects of the sun
increase. The Sunwatch, in varying colours, is available from Hosking
and Howells, Willington, Derby, for just under #40.
* LOGITECH have developed a handy little scanner that can lift full
colour pictures from documents to the computer screen. The PageScan
Color is a compact sheet fed scanner that plugs into the parallel port
and transforms pictures and text into high-quality screen images and
instantly useable data.
The scanner can lift from both bound and loose pages thanks to a
detachable head. The integrated software, activated from within any
Windows application by inserting a page, provides optical character
recognition as well as colour, monochrome scanning, copying, faxing, and
filing.
The software includes an image editor, Xerox image enhancement, the
character recognition which automatically re-keys text from hard copy
documents, and electronic file cabinet capabilities for organising
scanned documents. It's also small and neat and comes in at a shade
under #300.
* THE trouble with science and technology and this computer age is
that there's always some whizz kid nipping at one's heels. In this case
it's 15-year-old Gerard McKay of Largs who has launched his own computer
games magazine called The Cutting Edge.
In the past couple of months Gerard has sold 87 copies of the magazine
which features games reviews, and he plans a second edition soon.
''I want to widen my readership,'' he says. ''But as I am young, I
have the disadvantage that I am not being taken seriously by some of the
local shops. I hope you find this project worthy of support and find it
in your hearts to support me on my adventure in the big bad world of
business.
''I hope this might increase awareness of my mag which would get more
readers and thus get more advertisers.''
We hope so too. You never know future. Rupert Murdoch had to start
somewhere. Ayrshire games fans can contact Gerard on 01475 674428.
* SHARP has launched two new view-cams, which incorporate improved
low-reflectance active matrix LCD screens and viewfinders with clearer
on-screen images and improved performance in daylight.
The 3 and 4-inch camcorders have a pixel-boost for clearer screen view
and come with additional user-friendly features including message
recording facility and a neat block-shot 10-second recording mode.
A Glasgow revolution in chrome plating looks set, as Joe Donnelly
explains, to bring the silver lining of yesteryear back into our lives
THE days of cars a-glitter with chrome on trim, fender and grille are
long gone. Some readers beyond their teens will recall a time when
hub-caps were shiny silver metal instead of plastic and stayed firmly
clamped to the wheel and on the rare occasion when they did fall off,
they didn't shatter to smithereens.
In those jackdaw days, all that glittered was chromium plate, from
tea-trays to sauce-boats and milk-jugs. In fact almost everything that
was hyphenated was chrome-plated. It was a bright old world.
There are signs, however, that the silver lining might be staging a
comeback, thanks to advances being made at Caledonian University. While
chrome plating is old-hat, it is still vital in industry where the
hard-wearing glossy surface on metals are essential in car making,
aerospace, and many hi-tech industries. According to Caledonian's
faculty of science and technology, it's worth an estimated #100m to the
UK's economy. The downside is that the 20,000 tonnes of chromic acid
used in production is toxic, a suspected carcinogen, and is facing tight
controls in the EEC's health and safety legislation.
Apart from that, the chrome plating process is highly inefficient and
slow. Until now that is.
Caledonian's department of Energy and Environmental Technology has
developed a new, revolutionary method of plating using chemicals which
are much more environmentally safe. While the old method, used for 60
years, produced a thin and uneven coating, the Caledonian team, led by
Dr Mahmoud El Sharif has succeeded in producing a thick highly efficient
plating of such quality that it has won a major technological award.
Dr El Sharif's method dramatically reduces toxic waste and is 50 times
faster than any other known process based on trivalent chromium
electrolytes, otherwise known as Chromium 3. His shining example has
attracted a major #145,690 grant from the Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council.
He told Frontiers: ''Chrome is hard wearing, decorative and corrosion
resistant. But traditionally, chrome plating was made by using chromic
acid which is highly toxic and carcinogenic.
''Our aim was to get a form of plating, but from an environmentally
friendly process. Our method is harmless. We designed a new process
called high-speed electroplating which is a very novel approach. To do
this we used Chromium 3 which was previously used for decoration only
because the coating was too thin, only a few microns thick. Our
electroplating has managed to deposit substantially increased coatings,
a hundred times thicker than before.
''This will have a wide potential in industry, especially in heavy
machinery, hydraulic pistons where many of the parts are electroplated.
''We have now appointed a research fellow to scale the process up from
the lab stage, and we hope that in the near future we will be ready to
talk to companies about using the process in manufacturing,'' he said.
The Caledonian plating system could usher in high performance
components for industry, manufactured cheaply in a safe, low pollution
process.
It might also put a gleam back in a world that has seemed a little
dull since chrome disappeared from wheels.
* AT last, the world of science has taken a giant step forward and has
designed a cook that will do all your favourite meals to a turn, never
refuse to talk to you, and you don't even have to marry it. While your
Frontiersman waits for the deluge of angry anti-sexist letters, let him
explain that this was merely a joke (sorry girls) and that this
scientific marvel is billed as the world's first talking microwave.
An ideal machine for people with eyesight problems, the Cobolt
Speechmaster, patent pending, is a 900 watt nuker-cooker that talks back
in the nicest possible way. It's got a voice-clock, a verbal timer tells
you if the door is left open, and gives vocal confirmation of the
functions selected and the cooking time.
This little beauty will also tell you when cooking and defrosting is
complete, will take instructions to stir or turn food during cooking and
will also helpfully inform the chef how much time is remaining until his
tea is actually hot. Just to keep the balance, even a bachelor could use
it as long as he remembers not to use an iron pot or try to nuke an egg
still in the shell.
It will not, however, pour a pre-prandial G&amp;T. It's available from
Cobolt Systems Ltd, Reedham, Norwich, at #185 including delivery.
Still in the kitchen and on micro-processing foodwise, Sharp is
boasting the ''ultimate'' microwave with jet convection, grill, and
something they describe as Logicook. Now retailing for around #330, the
R-7N76 which sounds like a deadly and secret weapon, will do anything
from Korma and cottage pie to the Sunday joint.
Logicook apparently takes instructions from the food itself which
sounds scary, unnatural and smacks of Voodoo to one who has never heard
a frozen chicken make a request.
Talking cookers we can accept. Talking food will take a giant leap of
faith.
* ONE industry's trash -- a sugarcane processing by-product called
bagasse that's now burned for energy -- could prove to be the cotton
textile industry's treasure by providing an economical and
environmentally friendly way to remove dyes from wastewater.
US Department of Agriculture scientists have chemically modified
bagasse to quickly bind acidic dyes such as those used on cotton
textiles. In tests, the modified bagasse bound 16 times as much as
activated charcoal, widely used to treat industrial wastewater . . . in
a fraction of the time.
The chemists used finely milled bagasse converted into a quarternized
resin. Quarternizing is a chemical process that enables the bagasse to
pick up acidic dyes like a magnet. It takes from five to 15 minutes for
the modified bagasse to work.
It is estimated that a dollar's worth of commercially produced resin
would treat 1000 gallons of wastewater containing more than a half-pound
of dye remaining from the dyeing of 100 pounds of fabric. Moreover, the
treated wastewater could be recycled depending on the dye involved,
spent resin some day may be used as an animal feed or composted for use
as a high-nitrogen fertiliser.
While dye is a bane to some, it could be of benefit to others. Orchard
farmers could use it in their never-ending battle against the fruit fly
which eats the product and also into the profits. Agricultural
scientists have discovered that when the fruit fly eats a common red
dye, the pigment absorbs solar energy. The energy excites molecules
which in turn confer energy to oxygen molecules in the fly's body.
The molecular disturbance causes the oxygen to split into free
radicals which destroy the insect's cell membranes within hours.
America's Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to a massive range
of field trials in which the dye will be used on bait and the sub's
energy will do the rest. Such a solution to insects could replace
environmentally unfriendly insecticides.
* OILY fish dishes might be good for dyslexia sufferers according to
evidence gleaned by Jackie Stordy, a nutritionist from Surrey
University. Dyslexics have poor night vision as well as the more well
known difficulties with reading and writing. The rich fatty acids from
fish oil apparently helps improve dark-time vision. The research shows
that mothers of dyslexics often eat fewer foods containing the essential
fatty acids. Stordy's work suggests that regular meals of tuna,
mackerel, and sardines eaten during pregnancy might be beneficial.
* UNBUGGABLE communications have been invented by the US Air Force.
They've come up with a laser communicator designed for use in places
where ordinary radio might be picked up electronically. The little
radio, using a laser diode, has a receiver and tran smitter. The
variable beam modulates the sound waves and offers complete security
from electronic bugers.
* LASER radars used by police can, however, be jammed by a new
scrambler being marketed -- for now -- in the States for about $200.
They pick up radar scanning beams and return a signal which confuse
police radars which makes it impossible for them to calculate a driver's
speed. While many countries including the UK have legally banned radar
detectors, these laws don't apply to scramblers . . . yet. Sales are
expected to be brisk until the law catches up. So far the only
governmental interest so far has been from the US air force who have
invented the aforementioned unbuggable radio. They apparently want the
scrambler makers to design jammers to confuse enemy radar.
* A GLOUCESTER inventor has applied for a patent on a machine which
washes clothes, cooks and does the dishes. It can boil, fry or steam
food, wash the dishes after the meal and then clean the spilt gravy from
any clothes. The machine is expected to cost #800.
* WEB creation and management company Communicata have called time on
the traditional heavyweight product catalogues, directories and CD's
with the launch today of the Electronics Product Locator, a new internet
on-line service.
The company say the move from paper will suit firms because they are
expensive to produce, store and distribute. The Electronic Product
Locator is designed to reduce user search times for products and
suppliers sales and marketing costs.
For instance, a buyer seeking an electronics power pack would enter
base specifications like the voltage required and the locator would
search the relevant information on databases all over the world to
provide a list of suppliers, costs, and an order form.

PAPERBACKS
THE DAYDREAMER, Ian McEwan, Vintage, #4.99
* GROWN-UP people's inner lives are difficult enough for other
grown-ups to imagine. But the inner life of the child . . . these are
deep waters, Watson. Ian McEwan's collection of seven stories about an
imaginative little boy called Peter is a brave attempt to recall the
ineffable strangeness of that internal world. In Peter's mind, the world
can stand or fall upon the placement of his sister's dolls or the
mystery of a jar labelled Vanishing Cream; he changes lives with the
family cat and an aunt's new baby. Written with a bright, dreamlike
clarity, these gently disturbing tales may be McEwan's best work yet.
A BAG OF BOILED SWEETS: An Autobiography, Julian Critchley, Faber,
#6.99
* WHEN Tories grow intelligent, said George Orwell, it is time to
count your spoons; but when they grow as funny and affable as maverick
MP Julian Critchley too, the only thing left to do is call the cops.
Critchley's career has been distant from the corridors of power, which
has given him a genially sceptical view of power and politicians: he
needn't reproach himself for having done nothing very much in public
life when he looks at how much worse than nothing the great movers and
shakers have done. His recollections of the reigns of five Tory Prime
Ministers are in places quite priceless.
APOLLO 13, Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, Coronet, #5.99
* CO-AUTHORED by the commander (Lovell) of the almost disastrous
Apollo mission of April 1970, this novelisation (on which the film
starring Tom Hanks is based) of the facts is ponderously written as an
adventure story but reads very well as a touching reminder of the
romance of space in the 1960s. Those years when one bright-eyed,
corn-fed team of all-American boys after another were thrown into the
void on a Saturn V and a prayer, shepherded home by rows of
brainy-looking fat guys at Mission Control with specs, short-sleeved
shirts, and pocketfuls of pens, were a time when the future was not a
word to be scared of.
THE BIG BOOK OF COUNTRY MUSIC, Richard Carlin (ed), Penguin, #11
* UNMISSABLE for any closet sentimentalist who ever went Walkin' After
Midnight with Patsy Cline or staggered down The Lost Highway with Hank
Williams, this comprehensive encyclopaedia of Country themes, styles,
and stars is a fascinating dippable guide to the history of the most
widely and unfairly derided form of popular music in the world. Just the
names of some of the acts -- Lefty Frizzell, The Drifting Cowboys,
Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen -- have lonesome poetry that
makes you want to pull on your Tony Lamas and kick a few cultural
elitists in the saddle-interface region. Yee, and furthermore, haw!
LITTLE BOY BLUE, Edward Bunker, No Exit Press, #5.99
* AS life-of-crime novels go, few have had better-qualified authors
than Edward Bunker. From childhood to middle age, his life could have
been modelled on the song I Fought The Law (And The Law Won). Then he
started writing novels about it (he's also acted in Quentin Tarantino's
Reservoir Dogs), and the results are brilliant. This one, presumably
semi-autobiographical, is the story of a boy's graduation through the
ranks of professional crime and the punishment system over a long career
as a nogoodnik, and it reads like nothing less than The Catcher In The
Rye gone wrong. Goodness knows where Bunker learned to write like this.

The Illusionist by Jennifer Johnston
Sinclair-Stevenson, #14.99
STELLA meets a strange man on a train. On the journey from Liverpool
to Euston he snatches her book, takes an egg from behind her ear, and in
the taxi home gives her a red silk handkerchief, produced from nowhere.
He insists he is an illusionist rather than a magician or conjurer and
tells her his name is Martyn, spelled with a Y.
Her mother sees through him, but by then it's too late. Stella
believes she has found someone different. This is Martyn's biggest
trick, for his intention is to control her, to make her dependent on his
whimsical needs, almost convincing her it's what she wants and is in her
own best interests.
When they meet, Stella is a publisher's editor. She is offered a
partnership and Martyn feels threatened. He immediately buys a house in
Suffolk, forcing Stella to give up her job. Now he can isolate her, come
and go as he pleases without explanation, and when she has a daughter
his containment seems complete.
The child's name is Robin. ''He chose the name. He chose everything
that happened in the life he spent with me.'' In many ways Robin
continues Martyn's abuse, by continually taking Stella for granted,
demanding her attention, treating her as a servant.
Stella's journey back to reality begins when her ex-boss sends her a
typewriter and tells her to write a novel. This is Martyn's biggest
threat, because he cannot control her imagination.
Stells recalls her marriage from a distance. She left Martyn in London
and went home to Dublin. He and his vanload of white doves are killed by
an IRA bomb. ''You bloody Irish,'' says Robin, ''blew him to bits and
those pathetic birds . . . Sitting at traffic lights minding his own
business.'' She loves her father and is unaware that he has deliberated
courted her affections, used her as a means of alienating his wife, by
removing her daughter's love he ensured his wife's continued presence
and fidelity. Robin tells her mother she believes her to be the only
person in the world she truly hates.
This is the story of their release from Martyn. Stella's growth begins
when she uses the damage he caused against him and eventually there is
hope for Robin, though not without cost, for she is clearly distraught
at her father's death, still blames her mother for the separation, and
will obviously suffer from the loss of the illusions he gave her.
Stella's dilemma is whether she should protect her daughter from the
truth and endure her continuing contempt and hatred, or to shatter the
carefully manipulated illusion and take the consequences. Indeed, one of
the many good things about this fine, beautifully constructed novel is
the way Jennifer Johnston handles the effects of manipulation, the fact
that Stella never gives her opinion, always talks into herself, can
detach from a conversation at random, soar into her imagination as a
means of avoiding reality, and evades confrontation of any description.
The narrative moves between flashbacks of the marriage and Robin's
visit to Dublin following Martyn's funeral. The spare, in places
chilling style, allows us to follow Stella's thoughts, to see her skip
into illusion, to watch the scales fall from her eyes and feel the pain
of Robin's loss.
Dreams give way to a visit from her mother. Song lyrics and lines of
poetry are placed between conversations, pauses and slivers of random
thought. The fragmented style can be deceitful and in places the
movement between seemingly unrelated incidents and ideas can be
disconcerting, but that must surely be the intention, to show the
effects of long-term abuse on a survivor, albeit what may be considered
a mild and almost passive abuse.
The narrative eventually exposes what passes for, and is all too often
accepted, as love, the consquences on those who survive and the terrible
unhappiness of everyone concerned. It is Jennifer Johnston's finest
novel, taking her from the metaphor of the Irish country house and its
ruined past to a beautifully subtle chronicler of our times.

MUHAMMAD ALI: A Thirty-Year Journey, Howard L Bingham, Robson Books,
#12.99
* ''MUHAMMAD Ali is my hero. He is the greatest boxer that has ever
lived and he has given the world a very precious gift: the gift of fair,
competitive sport.'' Those are the words of Nelson Mandela, the
President of South Africa, who is one of a number of leading figures who
supply introductions for a new book on the former world heavyweight
champion, who is, one of the most outstanding and charismatic sportsmen
of all time.
Many books have been written about the man who could ''float like a
butterfly and sting like a bee'', but the latest is a nostalgic,
pictorial look back at the great man's career.
Stunning pictures capture Ali's life from his young days as Cassius
Clay in Louisville until a memorable meeting with Nelson Mandela in
South Africa in 1993. This is a quality treasure trove of memories for
all.

March Calf, #5.99 paperback; Volume 4, The Thought-Fox, #5.99 paperback.

Ted Hughes. Difficulties of a Bridegroom: Collected Short Stories.
Faber, #12.99
FOR too long and for two wrong reasons Ted Hughes has come in for an
unfair share of verbal abuse. The suicide of his first wife Sylvia
Plath, in 1963, led some fanatical feminists to savage Hughes as a
monster.
In the critical world, Plathology became an industry rather than an
art and books about Sylvia tended to be tough on Ted though he had the
tough luck to live with a woman who was suicidally depressed long before
she met him as she confessed in poems and in her autobiographical novel
The Bell Jar (1963).
Since his appointment as Poet Laureate in 1984 and the appearance of
his odd poems on the royal family he has been an easy target for cheap
shots -- treated not so much as a Lost Leader, as Browning memorably
namecalled Wordsworth after Old Bill became Poet Laureate in 1843, but
more as a Toast Reader. Edward J Hughes must be used to namecalling by
now. He made his name by calling himself Ted in the Teddy Boy era.
He has always been a controversial poet, criticised by many as a
versifier of violence. One critic called him ''a bruiser who pummels his
readers with the harshest, most solid words in order to batter them into
submission''.
Another violently objected to the poem Hawk Roosting (first collected
in Lupercal in 1960 and now included in the fourth volume of Collected
Animal Poems) which prompted Hughes to protest: ''That bird is accused
of being a fascist . . . the symbol of some horrible totalitarian
genocidal dictator''. The implication, as Hughes realised, was obvious:
only a nasty man could create verse for a feathered fascist.
Hawk Roosting remains the most famous, or infamous, of Hughes's animal
poems. It begins with the hawk defining its inhuman nature. It has its
eyes closed but its body is alive with instinct. It has nothing to do
with man's ''falsifying dream'', no need for an uplifting vision of the
natural world. All it wants to do is devour: ''I kill where I please
because it is all mine/There is no sophistry in my body/My manners are
tearing off heads.'' It was an act of critical folly to assume that
Hughes identified with his hawk. Yet he earned a reputation as a hard
man of poetry. A Ted.
And he acted the part. Tall and toughish-looking he used to come to
literary parties attired in a leather jacket and sporting a haircut that
looked unfortunately Hitlerian. He talked tough.
His aggressive manner matched the image, and imagery, of the man who
wrote poems about savage creatures like hawks tearing off heads or pigs
biting back.
View of a Pig is one of Hughes's finest poems and gives a clue to his
character. He is not advocating animal violence. He is exposing the
animal in man. View of a Pig is a lament for a dead animal man has
reduced to ''Just so much/A poundage of lard and pork.'' All man sees in
the pig's bundle of energy is a carcass for the table. Man takes it,
kills it, packages it, eats it in the lifeless luxury of his domestic
cage. The slow heavy monosyllables of the poem and the scissory cutting
edge of the key words (pink, thick pink bulk, sack, walking, factual,
shocking, pathetic, squeal, scour) convey both the gravity of death and
the sliced, plastic-packaged, fragmentary grave that awaits the pig.
Man, for Hughes, is an intellectual animal capable of as much cruelty
as any supposedly stupid creature.
Hughes's understanding of animals is extraordinary and An Otter is
arguably his finest animal poem. It shows Hughes as a wonderfully gifted
observer of the beauty of inhuman nature and the brutality of human
nature. The otter is poetry in motion -- ''Four-legged yet water-gifted
. . . With webbed feet and long ruddering tail/And a round head like an
old tomcat'' -- in his own element. When man enters the otter's element,
motion no longer matters for the active animal ''Yanked above hounds,
reverts to nothing at all/To this long pelt over the back of a chair.''
The otter kills for food, man kills the otter for fashion which says a
lot about a so-called superior species.
The Collected Animal Poems range from adult compositions like An Otter
to children's poems. With his remarkable repertoire, Hughes encourages
human beings to enter into the lives of such animals as the badger, bat,
bear, bull, bullfrog, calf, cat, cougar, cow, crab, deer, dog, donkey,
and so on. No animals are dumb when Hughes speaks his volumes for them.
His short stories, collected in Difficulties of a Bridegroom, are
obsessed with animals. Sunday, clearly autobiographical, tells the tale
of Michael, a boy bored by Bible-punchers and excited by animals. He
wants to see Billy Red, the rat-catcher who performs every Sunday in a
pub. Billy bites rats to death: ''Billy Red's face was compressed in a
snarl and as he snapped his head from side to side the dark, elongated
body of the rat whipped round his neck . . . A dozen shakes, and Billy
Red stopped, his head lowered . . . Then the rat spasmed, fighting with
all its paws, and Billy shook again wildly, the rat's tail flying like a
lash. This time when he stopped the body hung down limply.''
The story, complementary to the poem Song of a Rat where the creature
is a symbol of suffering, leaves one with more sympathy for the rat than
the rat-catcher.
In his animal poems and stories Hughes brings out the beast in man and
the best in himself -- and his best is good enough for anybody who cares
for other creatures.

ROSE MADDER
Stephen King
Hodder &amp; Stoughton, #16.99
STEPHEN KING is the world's best-selling author of cheap fiction.
Sale-graphs for his novels leave writers such as Jeffrey Archer and
Barbara Taylor Bradford sobbing into the cornflakes. But, until now, I'd
never read a word by the ''master of horror and suspense''; and, after
this, I doubt I have the stomach for another. It's about a battered
wife, Rose Daniels, her escape from her depraved policeman husband,
Norman, and his remorseless quest to find her.
Make no mistake: stomach you'll need. I almost gave up on the fifth
page, where Rose miscarries her child after a vicious kicking -- '' . .
. as if she is sitting in a sitz bath full of warm, thick liquid''.
Later she's buggered with a tennis racquet -- ''. . . the handle
slippery with blood''. Later still, a friend of hers is caught by the
creep and bitten to death -- yes, bitten -- before Norman cleans up in
the shower; and quite right too, because the ''entire lower half of his
face was covered with blood, hair and little tags of skin''.
And then there's another lass who, fighting Norman for her life in a
closet, neatly impales her eye on a coat-hook -- '' . . . a meaty sound
that was almost a pop like a champagne cork . . . ''
Well, you get the grasp. The plot is contemporary enough: domestic
violence, enslaved spouse Rose, vicious psychopath Norman. (Why are
homicidal fruitcakes always called Norman? -- well, King lets a
character refer to Norman Bates, nudge-nudge). And so she has lived,
obsessively cleaning their pad in terror of his temper, too cowed ever
to leave it, in one of America's grottier east coast cities.
Now, early in the book, after 14 years of punch-soaking, Rose Daniels
comes to herself and walks out, pausing only to pinch her husband's
hole-in-the-wall card. Lost, clueless, and with minimal self-confidence,
she reaches another grotty city and is there befriended by a women's
refuge group, ''Daughters and Sisters''.
She gains self-respect, a good job, an apartment, caring New Age man
boyfriend, new name, a new life . . . but Norman, old mate, is on her
trail, with all the resources of a policeman to assist him. And when he
finds her he will talk to her Right Up Close. And then, if God helps
him, he will kill her twice . . .
The novel, of course, is a fairly bog-standard plot of pursuit, with a
competently sustained vein of suspense and lots of raspberry-jam gore.
What lifts it into another realm is a supernatural sub-plot, centred on
a cheap painting Rose buys for her new pad, a rear view of a beautiful
woman gazing into a weird classical landscape. This character wears a
chiton of deep russet hue -- rose madder, as artists dub it, and hence
our title.
On a night, mystically, our Rose is drawn into this other world,
Narnia-like, where she meets Ruth Madder, has various epic adventures,
and emerges empowered to face down the appalling Norman . . .
Anyway, that's enough plot. If you're a Stephen King nut, you won't
thank me for telling, and if not you probably gave up several paragraphs
ago, turning the page with an awkward swallow.
Stephen King is a fine writer. His technique and language are a cut
above the norms of pulp fiction, and some phrases are so good I would
have written them down in a commonplace book, if I kept one. Try this
for happiness -- ''The whole world seemed perfect around her, and she
perfect within it''. Or, on the joy of being seized by a work of art,
because it reminds us of ''the song that made us cry . . . the poem that
made us glad to be alive, the dance that made us forget for a few
minutes that some day we will not be''.
His skill in this genre is manifest. The horror is underplayed:
Norman's most vicious assaults happen offstage. There are streaks of
malicious humour -- ''Norman would go to see anything starring Clint
Eastwood'' -- and a strong supporting cast, including a right-on duchess
of feminism (who is fantasising about making the cover of Time magazine
when Norman drops in for a bite), and a wonderful 220lb black lesbian,
of generous spirit, who gives the creep the first decent battering of
his life.
King makes you think, about appalling men and the women who love them.
Profound documentary this ain't, but it does give you a sense of the
claustrophobic nightmare of a brutal, soul-destroying marriage to
someone bigger and tougher than you are.
The King vision is dark. His is not the America of white picket fences
and huckleberry pie. It's the America of industrial rain, urban decay,
obscene graffiti, nasty streetlife; neighbours you would never dream of
speaking to, families in terminal collapse. There is also the ketchup,
the slaughter, and the mayhem.
What part of our natures is drawn to take pleasure in brutality? Well,
I suppose, the exercise puts our own weary lives into perspective; you
may be wracked by the new contract, or getting gyp with the Hoover, but
at least you're not bursting your eye on a coat-hook . . .
Stephen King's resolution is, at the last, strangely amoral, even
though the story has a happy ending, with nasty folk meeting the deaths
they deserve, and a few others dying besides. There is no
accountability, no order, no rightness, no God.
I could not put this book down, once I started it, but I won't be
reading another Stephen King; it's not a taste I want to acquire.

A BOOK AT BEDTIME
Artist and writer Maud Sulter describes to ANN DONALD what she likes
to read at night.
* I STARTED this summer reading The Information by Martin Amis. As an
author I'd describe it as a convincing expose of all the neuroses that
writers have and the politics and intrigue of writing. I'm not really a
fan of his, but the fact that it was about a writer made me go out and
buy it, and it also made me go out and buy his earlier book London
Fields.
Another book was All The Dogs In My Life by Elizabeth Von Arnim which
was originally published in 1936. I was seduced into buying it because
it has fox terriers on the front and I'm a fox terrier addict myself
with two at home. She follows my own philosophy on life that dogs tend
to be nicer than people in that I have deeper more meaningful
relationships with dogs. Von Arnim was born in Australia, I think, and
had a couple of husbands, spent a few years sur le continent and then
came to England. What the book is doing is tracking the dogs that she
owned at certain periods in her life with the dogs acting as a metaphor
for her life.
Another book is by Adrienne Rich and is her Collected Early Works of
poetry. I've read all of her work and buy them as soon as they come out.
I like the fact that she makes poetry out of situations that can be
painful and harsh. I think that it's important for contemporary poets to
address contemporary issues, and Rich definitely rises to that challenge
in dealing with politics, violence and power. I always feel empowered
every time I read her writing because it's so uplifting.
The final book that I've been reading is by Juliana Schiesari and is
called The Gendering Of Melancholia -- Feminism, Psychoanalysis and The
Symbols of Loss In Renaissance Literature. It's a very accessible and
interesting book in which she discusses how in Renaissance times women's
rituals of mourning were outlawed from the streets. It was at the time
medicine was being institutionalised so female healers and midwives were
phased out by history.

The Prime Ministers, An Irreverent Political History in
Cartoons.Kenneth Baker, Thames and Hudson pp 192, #15.95.
THIS is a curate's egg of a book, marvellous in parts but less than
perfect as a whole. Kenneth Baker's idea -- telling how the office of
Prime Minister has developed, and how successive holders have been
regarded by the electorate by using contemporary cartoons to make his
points -- is sound. There are two problems, however, with this approach
and which this beautifully illustrated book cannot solve. One is due to
the format. Baker's text requires the luxury of space allowed by the
coffee-table book format, whereas all it gets is standard hard back
space. The other is that cartoons, by their nature ephemeral, have to be
explained to later generations. Doing that requires substantial captions
which interrupt the flow of the text.
Maybe Baker would have been wiser to have incorporated his captions
into the body of his text, because reading them means losing the thread
of his narrative. Baker, an experienced anthologist, is, as always,
civilised company, but the account of how the office of Prime Minister
has developed since the time of Robert Walpole demands more than
occasional dipping into.
He is at his best with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century
cartoonists, and the chapters dealing with premiers from Harold Wilson
onwards are rather disappointing, especially the choice of cartoons.
There are probably good copyright reasons for this, but I could have
pointed him in the direction of a handful which are funnier and more
apposite. This is no idle boast.
Some years ago as secretary of the Press Gallery, I trawled Fleet
Street's finest for cartoons to hang there -- the response was generous
-- and I imagine that it is for the Gallery, their owner with one
exception, to give permission for reproduction. The exception is a
brilliant drawing of Jim Callaghan by Gerald Scarfe which he gave us on
loan.
Although less obviously vicious than the Scarfe drawing shown of
Harold Wilson looking like a bloated slug in his Garter Robes, this most
scathing of contemporary cartoonists has caught the essence of Sunny Jim
to perfection. Beneath that avuncular exterior, behind the Cheshire Cat
smile, lurks a thoroughly nasty man.
Cartoonists have varied with the centuries. In the late eighteenth
century, the age of Gillray and Rowlandson, they could be exceedingly
vicious and were not bound by any grounds of good taste. Defecation,
fornication, urination and unnatural sexual practices were commonplace
weapons for attacking the mighty. These cartoons were the television
appearances of the time, letting people, who otherwise would never see
what their leaders looked like, a chance to assess their vices and
virtues.
Victorian humour was more wordy, more inclined to classical and
literary allusions and the things the politicians said to one another
were more wounding than the drawings of Tenniel and Leach, while the
Edwardians like Beerbohm were more decadadent, more elegant in their
approach.
The greatest cartoonists of the present century, Low and Vicky, were
not all that funny, but they were perceptive. There is a splendid Low
drawing from May 1940 which shows Churchill leading the massed rans of
the Commons with the caption ''All Behind You Winston''. It conveys,
more than words could, the mood of national solidarity at the time.
Gerald Scarfe and Ralph Steadman are the cartoonists today nearest to
their eighteenth-century forebears in the way they approach their
victims. Scarfe's drawing of Harold MacMillan sitting nude in a chair in
the pose made famous by Christine Keeler is a devastating attack on the
man, as is his drawing of Harold Wilson kissing LBJ's backside --
''Vietnam, right behind you'' -- is a match for the famous one showing
Wallpole straddling the entrance to the Treasury, his naked bottom an
obstacle to be kissed by all seeking preferment.
Steadman, whose work was taken onto television in Spitting Image by
Fluck and Law, has also forever pinned down the frailties of the great
and the good with some unrelenting work.
Baker is weak on Thatcher as a cartoon creation, but spot on about
John Major, a man who has been harshly treated being shown as
indecisive, grey, stubborn and hapless. The great pity is he himself
never became Prime Minister because there are some wicked Baker
cartoons. Would he have had the courage to show any?
Politicians like to collect cartoons of themselves, he admits, but
they resent being ridiculed. He reveals that when Ted Heath was asked
why he did not have cartoons in his small collection that were critical,
said with an air of aloof dismissal: ''I can't think of any. If they
were unfair, I would not remember them.'' It explains why the collection
is small and why the one Baker show of himself is so complimentary.
He is the captain going down with his ship, the year 1990, when he was
party chairman at the time of her fall. It is not the role cartoonists
usually gave him by any means.

'Muggeridge - The Biography', Richard Ingrams, Harper Collins, #18
MALCOLM Muggeridge and I met only twice. I doubt if the old boy
remembered either occasion. He was quite good at not remembering things.
My first and second impressions of the famous media personality were of
an affected, self-obsessed hypocrite. Nothing in this biography by
Richard Ingrams changes that opinion.
Our first encounter was at the Edinburgh University rectorial election
of 1966, over sherry in the senior common room of Holland House, a hall
of residence which in those days had pretensions to the social
organisation of an Oxbridge college.
As a junior member of his victorious campaign team (I had designed the
''Betta Getta Muggerector'' poster) I managed to corner the great man
for five minutes. He was the first famous person I had ever met, after
all, although I had once been within two yards of the Queen Mum when she
visited my school in England. But she spoke to the boy next to me.
As an opener after the pleasantries, I suggested to the scourge of the
Establishment that it might be nice if our new rector could take the
chair of the university court -- of which he was now the elected
president -- and put forward the case for students to have some small
role in the administration of our university.
I thought I was saying the right thing. Not a bit of it. The old
buzzard ranted that students were there to study and running the
university was none of their business. Without waiting for a reply, he
swung on his heel and plunged into conversation with a senior academic.
It was clear that, after all, we were not going to have a ''working''
rector. That would have to wait until 1972, when Gordon Brown became the
second student rector after my own brief, stormy, and not very effective
tenure of the post.
Our second meeting was on the day of Muggeridge's infamous sermon in
St Giles Cathedral, when he denounced us all for our slobbering
addiction to sex and pot, resigned the rectorship from the pulpit and
boosted his faltering career through the resulting publicity.
I was selling copies of the Student newspaper outside the university
staff club in Chambers Street that morning. As news editor of the paper
I always carried a fag packet as a notebook. As Muggeridge strode up, I
whipped it out and respectfuly asked our Lord Rector if he had any
comment on the editorial of that day's edition.
I expected him to criticise the demand by my editor, Anna Coote, that
he should act as advocate for the democratically elected Students
Representative Council in their campaign to have contraceptive advice
freely available at the student health centre or resign. He was supposed
to advocate, if not to agree.
He did not mention the irreconcilable crisis of personal conscience
which this caused him, and about which he was to pontificate in St Giles
a few hours later. Instead, he jabbed a quivering finger at the
back-page cartoon by Phil Bevis, a maths student and cartoonist of
Scarfeian potential whom I last heard of living in obscurity on the
wrong side of Hampstead. It showed Muggeridge as a screaming skull. With
hindsight, it seems remarkably prescient.
''If I had published something like this, I would go to my grave
ashamed!'' he roared, and walked out of my life.
Shame, and expiating it, was what St Mugg was all about. By the time
he did go to his grave he had done extensive, well-publicised penance
for his indulgence in women (he walked out on his poor wife a few times,
as well as on me), whisky, tobacco, barbiturates and savage, unprovoked
attacks on people and causes he had once espoused.
Ingrams, Muggeridge's protege, gives us more detail than Ian Hunter's
1980 biography.
Although this is to some extent an authorised biography, it does not
dodge sensationally embarrassing facts. Ingrams doggedly catalogues the
peccadilloes of a serial philanderer, absentee father, quarrelsome
drunk, sometime radical, failed novelist, spy, professional dilettante,
and rather nasty (if amusing) snob. It makes a thoroughly good read.
The Edinburgh University incident rates only a page in Ingrams's book
but the furore did catapault Muggeridge to fame as a repenting sinner
and born-again media Christian. The last of his many careers, religious
broadcasting, was launched on that chilly Edinburgh evening.
Ingrams relies exclusively on the Muggeridge version of events,
describing Anna Coote and the rest of us as ''a small and
unrepresentative band of Marxists''. I don't think Anna was a Marxist,
then or now. Nor was I. Besides, we were all democratically elected,
some of us with bigger majorities than Muggeridge.
As for our ''political posturings'', the Students' Representative
Council did not condone or have a policy on promiscuity. The demand for
better contraceptive advice for students was the result of sober,
factual debate about the increasing problem of unwanted pregnancies.
Muggeridge, with his extensive personal knowledge of the leg-over
business, might have been expected to support it.
Yes, we liked our nookie, although even the most dissolute could not
rival the rector's track record in sexual athletics. Many of us had
smoked a joint or two but beer was our favoured intoxicant and very few
took LSD more than once (I have yet to try it). You could not function
in student politics or journalism if you were a dopehead, not least
because you needed your wits about you when dinosaurs like Muggeridge
were stalking the swamp.
As so often happened, Muggeridge reached for ready-to-wear prejudices
rather than facts when he composed his diatribe against ''permissive''
students. Ingrams notes repeatedly that once he had an idea in his head
it was impossible to shift it, whatever the evidence to the contrary.
The biographer's own failure properly to investigate that 27-year-old
storm in a teacup at Edinburgh University makes me wonder how good his
research is on other, more important topics.
Muggeridge was a pain in the backside all his life. He took a sadistic
pleasure in sneering at former mentors such as C P Scott of the
Manchester Guardian. His accent was false and he was often false to his
friends. A fickle biter of hands that fed him, he got away with it
because he could be such scintillating good company -- and because he
would defend his betrayals as necessities in the pursuit of ''truth''.
In a hundred years he will be remembered for only two achievements
among the ''Chronicles of Wasted Time'' described so selectively in his
1972 autobiography: the brilliant Manchester Guardian reports from the
Soviet Union in March 1933, when he was the first to expose Stalin's
genocide of the Kulaks; and his (at first unwitting) creation of Mother
Teresa of Calcutta as a reluctant media superstar.
In the end, he made his peace with his maker. It was a pity, but not a
surprise, that returning to the fold involved using his considerable
talents for some very dubious causes on the new religious right.
It was even more of a pity that, having revealed the extent of the
Bolshevik-engineered famine in the Ukraine and the blind hypocrisy of
Communist fellow-travellers in the West, he turned viciously against the
civilised, compassionate traditions of British democratic socialism and
rejected the faith of his father, Croydon Labour councillor Harry
Muggeridge.
Muggeridge Senior emerges from Ingrams's book as a better man, in
almost every respect, than his tormented third son.

TERESA'S DECISION: TALES OF CATALONIA AND SCOTLAND, PAST AND PRESENT.
Mercedes Claraso. Black Ace Books, #14.95.
A HEART SO WHITE. Javier Marias. Harvill Press, #14.99
ONE of the more colourful aspects of the devolution debate has been
its habit of encouraging comparisons (of varying degrees of
inappropriateness) between Scotland and just about every other small,
independent-minded nation or region in Europe. Normally to be found near
the top of the list -- be it Alex Salmond's version or Gordon Brown's --
is Catalonia. It makes you wonder what the similarities are. After all,
Spain's north-eastern ''autonomia'' is rich, right-wing, culturally
vibrant, and politically powerful.
Mercedes Claraso makes no such glib cultural parallels. Born of a
Catalan father and Scottish mother, her background is in itself tidy
evidence that things aren't the way some casual Scottish independistas
would have them. She uses subject matter from both places to evoke
palpably different landscapes, histories, and attitudes. In fact it is
the structural strength of this collection that we get a sense of
movement between differing styles of writing just as the stories
alternate between divergent national characteristics.
What is perhaps ironic is that, while Claraso has lived most of her
life in Scotland, the tales of Catalonia are more vivid. This is in part
due to her use of the Spanish Civil War. Since all the stories are brief
and neatly told, those set against a background of direct moral and
physical struggle are lent an instant dramatic starkness which gives
them weight. The Scottish themes, on the other hand, are more homely, a
shade sentimental, and consequently less satisfying.
Where it works, however, the charm of Teresa's Decision lies in its
concise narrative crafting. As she lovingly doubles up her two native
countries Mercedes Claraso achieves simplicity, directness, and a
delicately communicated sense of locality.
Complexity, evasiveness, and a darkly suave cosmopolitanism give A
Heart So White a different kind of international stretch. Javier Marias
weaves the various strands of his novel through Havana, Madrid, New
York, and Geneva to explain his narrator's sense of encroaching despair.
Juan is a highly accomplished interpreter possessed by the sense that
whatever he does the world remains untranslatable or, rather, that any
attempt to translate it is futile because all significant truth must
remain unspoken. He feels that his recent marriage has obliterated the
future and that wherever he travels he remains shackled to the small
world of his individuality and a violent family secret.
The puzzle of his father's first two marriages is the one thing he
doesn't want to interpret even although it contains the explanation for
his own existence.
As the plot divides and subdivides, and meditative digressions lead
down increasingly uncertain tangents, one gets the sad feeling that this
will be a book that makes a point of narrative inconclusiveness and
philosophical ambiguity. But Marias comes up with an ending which, if
this were an action thriller rather than a whodunit of ideas, would have
all the surprised clarity of a conspiracy being explained over the
corpses of the bad guys.
It's not so much exciting as mind-bendingly clever. The suicide of
Juan's aunt, overheard whispers of murder in Havana, the meaning of Mrs
Thatcher's imaginary views on love and dictatorship, a dangerous liaison
organised by video date-line in New York: a multitude of apparently
disparate fragments of plot and idea suddenly zoom back into focus and
become relevant.
The narrator's despair, which is at first made out to be an
inescapable condition of life, turns out to be the result of a
genealogical mystery with at least a partial solution.
Not that its ingenuity is enough to make A Heart So White a great
book. But it is technically dazzling and gives a good idea of why Javier
Marias is placed alongside Eduardo Mendoza as one of Spain's leading
novelists.

Nightmare at 25 Cromwell Street
MRS Rosemary West heard prosecuting counsel yesterday accuse her of
joining her husband in a horrific catalogue of killings, torture, and
sexual abuse on vulnerable young girls.
She remained unemotional in the dock, save for a brief moment when she
wiped away tear with a tissue.
At least two of her alleged victims could well have been kept alive,
bound and gagged, for days for the sexual gratification of Mrs West and
her husband Frederick, found dead in a prison cell on January 1,
Winchester Crown Court was told.
Some of Mrs West's alleged 10 murder victims had been snatched while
hitch-hiking before being taken to 25 Cromwell Street where they were
subjected to depraved sexual abuse before being killed, Mr Brian Leveson
QC prosecuting told the jury of eight men and four women.
Seven had been gagged with masking tape, their own clothing, or a belt
to prevent them screaming out as they underwent sexual attacks, Mr
Leveson said.
He described how forensic scientists discovered that the victims had
been naked, dismembered, decapitated, but many bones -- largely from the
feet and hands -- were missing when one by one their tiny graves were
excavated in the cellar and garden at Cromwell Street.
Each was dumped without dignity or respect in a different small hole
some three feet below the ground in the garden, in the cellar, and
underneath a bathroom.
Among the alleged victims were the Wests' oldest daughter Heather, who
disappeared just before her 17th birthday and Charmaine, Frederick
West's Scots-born stepdaughter. She disappeared at the age of eight.
Five of the bodies were recovered from the Cromwell Street cellar
where they had been buried clockwise in a ring.
What police discovered when they began digging was more terrible than
words can express, said Mr Leveson.
The court was told that Rosemary and Frederick West went out cruising,
driving around, to pick up hitch-hikers. All of them were young women or
girls and most of them with vulnerable backgrounds.
In this fashion they picked up a girl, Caroline Owens, and persuaded
her to become their nannie. After she had left this job she was once
more picked up by the Wests.
She was then sexually abused in the back of the vehicle by Mrs West
and eventually knocked senseless by the husband. When she recovered
consciousness she was bound and gagged and driven to Cromwell Street
where she was sexually abused overnight by both Wests.
Caroline survived, the Crown said, but she informed on the Wests, who
were subsequently fined for the assault.
They could not take the chance with other victims, said Mr Leveson.
''Those whom the Wests believed would not complain -- perhaps because
their involvement appeared to be willing or perhaps by their very
vulnerability as personalities -- lived,'' he said.
''Those whom it was believed posed a threat -- perhaps because of
their injuries or perhaps because they might talk to the police and
report what happened -- did not. Death was the option for them.''
Mr Leveson insisted that the events taking place at Cromwell Street
must have been known to Rosemary West. Over and above, she must have
been a willing and enthusiastic participant, he declared.
He said there were two additional killings, but it was not alleged Mrs
West was involved. They were of Charmaine's mother Rena and Scots-born
babyminder Ann McFall.
Mr Leveson began by telling the jury that Heather had lived with her
parents and stepsisters initially at 25 Midland Road and then at 25
Cromwell Street in Gloucester.
In June 1987, when she was 16, she disappeared. Her parents did not
report her missing. The reason was simple: they knew she was dead
because both had been involved in killing her, the court heard. Mr
Leveson said those who asked were told she had left home.
Eventually, in 1992, when police inquired, Mrs West said she had heard
from Heather on the telephone. On February 24 last year, armed with a
search warrant, police went to 25 Cromwell Street.
Two days later, under the patio which had been laid in the back
garden, they unearthed a skeleton. The skull had been hacked from the
spine; bones had been chopped to reduce the area into which the skeleton
could be forced; bones were missing.
It was Heather West.
There was a subsequent inquiry on life at 25 Cromwell Street. Other
girls who came and went over the years spoke of violent and degrading
sexual activity.
The police also carried out investigations at 25 Midland Road. Mr and
Mrs West lived there with Heather and her stepsisters in a one-bedroom
flat. One, Charmaine, had not been seen since 1971.
Underneath what was now the kitchen at Midland Road, but in 1971 was a
cellar under a bathroom, police found another skeleton with missing
bones. It was a small girl, and the Crown alleged it was the remains of
Charmaine.
''For her death also, the Crown allege that this defendant is
responsible,'' said Mr Levenson.
It was not suggested that she acted alone in the 10 counts of murder
of which she had been charged.
As to the nine found at Cromwell Street, she acted with Frederick
West; they were in it together, said the prosecuting counsel. As far as
Charmaine was concerned, the Crown suggested Rosemary West probably
acted on her own. Frederick West had been in prison at around the time
of the girl's disappearance and likely death.
Mr Leveson cautioned the jury that the picture he would paint,
revealed by the evidence, was both horrific and harrowing.
At the core of the case was the relationship between Frederick and
Rosemary West -- what they each knew about each other, what they did
together, what they did to others and how far each was prepared to go.
''Both were obsessed with sex,'' said Mr Leveson.
By the summer of 1971 the Wests had moved to Midland Road. There the
Wests told a neighbour of the way they picked up girls hitch-hiking.
Counsel then described how over the years Mr West had carried out many
alterations at Cromwell Street. These began when the first of many
bodies was buried.
He said in little more than two years following the original abduction
and sexual assault on Caroline Owens in 1972 no less than six girls, one
after the other, met their death each in very similar if not absolutely
identical circumstances.
He told the jury they would hear evidence from other girls. There was
one whom he called Miss A, who in about 1975 at the age of 13 was placed
in care in Gloucester. She recalls visiting 25 Cromwell Street, and
meeting the Wests.
Later, when she was 15 she returned to Cromwell Street, and there
followed incidents with two other girls, in which they and Miss A were
naked. Limbs were taped, and sexual acts were committed, involving both
Wests, he said.
The court was told that in November, 1988, a woman Kathryn Halliday,
who lived at 11 Cromwell Street came into contact with Frederick West.
She was bi-sexual. Within minutes of walking into 25 Cromwell Street,
Mrs West had taken off all her clothes and the three of them went to a
bedroom where Mr West recorded what they did on video.
There followed daily visits and Mrs Halliday was shown whips and hoods
and on occasions she was tied to the bed and blindfolded. Their
behaviour became more and more violent, but ended when Mrs Halliday felt
the activities were going beyond her physical and emotional limits.
Mr Leveson said these events were highly material when it was
considered what Mrs West must have known about those who were brought to
Cromwell Street and buried there.
The case continues.

We're all Jock Tamson's bairns, but we all have distinct and disparate
lives, with many stories to tell. Gavin Bell introduces the first in a
series of portraits of Scots and the communities in which they live.
Pictures by Edward Jones
THE sun has barely risen over the sleepy farmland of south Ayrshire.
The valleys are still shrouded in mist, and the chill of the night
lingers, but from an upland meadow comes the rhythmic clang of a hammer
on steel.
A handsome black Welsh cob is standing patiently outside her stable,
unperturbed by a young man cradling her near foreleg and banging the
last nails into a new shoe. She is a big, young horse, and her owner is
holding her firmly by a head collar, but she is perfectly calm. Already
she trusts this man with the hammer and anvil, and occasionally she
turns around to nuzzle him.
When the job is done, the cob clatters across the stableyard in her
new shoes, and a moment later she is cantering around a field, neighing
and tossing her dark mane with the pleasure of being free.
A woman emerges from a white-washed cottage bearing mugs of coffee. We
sit on a low stone wall, watching the mists clearing from
steeply-sloping hills on either side to reveal a patchwork of yellow
fields and green forests. The only sounds are of cattle lowing, birds
singing, and the occasional crowing of a cock.
The woman's husband says: ''I'd say we'll have a clear view 30 miles
doon the valley the day. Sometimes ye can see a' the way tae Ireland,
ken.'' The man with the hammer and the anvil says: ''On mornings like
these, ye cannae beat this job.''
In fact, that is his sentiment on most mornings, rain or shine. Kevin
Moriarty loves his work as a farrier -- a shoeing-smith -- and he cannot
imagine a better way of earning a living. He rises early, he finishes
late, he works six days a week and sometimes seven. And he wouldn't have
it any other way.
''I like being out in the open all day, and travelling from place to
place,'' he says. ''I could never be cooped up in an office. And I've
always worked with horses, I suppose it's the thing I know best.'' There
is no regret in his voice when he says: ''It's the only thing I can
do.''
His elder brother is an aircraft crash investigator, which Kevin
considers ''a bit of an outrageous job'', and his younger brother is
studying ''something to do with electronics'' at Strathclyde University.
Kevin left secondary school in Kilwinning with two 0-levels, but by then
he was an accomplished horseman, having been riding as a pastime for 10
years. He was happy to be taken on as an apprentice to two local
farriers, and for the past four years he has been working on his own
account. It has never occurred to him to do anything else.
''Sometimes I get to a stage in the day when I wish I was finished,
but I'm quite happy with what I do,'' he says. ''It's given me all I've
got, this job.''
What Kevin has is a renovated cottage in the rural heart of Ayrshire,
an adjoining three-acre field that he hasn't figured out what to do with
yet, two high-powered Japanese motor-cycles in his garage, and a quality
of life many would envy.
Far from the stresses of urban living, he commutes along country
lanes, with the tools of his trade jangling in the back of a
mud-spattered four-wheel-drive vehicle, to places that look like Old
MacDonald's Farm. Apart from horses, there are usually dogs, a few cats,
occasionally goats, and sometimes ferrets. There are big, fat, contented
cows everywhere.
One of Kevin's customers, a forestry contractor who breeds pedigree
dogs, explains why he keeps ferrets. He says they are susceptible to a
particularly nasty canine disease, and provide an early warning of its
presence by going into convulsions and dying. He gestures to Kevin, and
says: ''Like when the blacksmith hits his thumb.'' Kevin replies: ''But
the ferrets don't cry.''
Nor does Kevin, although he has every right to sometimes. Over the
years he has been kicked in the chest, in the arms, the legs, and the
nether regions. But his worst injury was self-inflicted, when a
horseshoe spun out of his tongs under a hammer blow and shattered all of
his teeth. ''It comes with the job,'' he says philosophically. ''You
have to take a knock or two.''
False teeth notwithstanding, he is a fine figure of a man with the
kind of lean, hard frame that would leave an assailant with bruised
knuckles. It is usually clothed in jeans and suede chaps, and a cut-off
T-shirt, whatever the weather.
The owner of the Welsh cob, who is wearing a pullover and a jacket
against the morning chill, remarks on this: ''The thing about
blacksmiths, you never see them with a jacket. June or January, it's
always sleeveless T-shirts. I don't know what it is, but they don't get
cold.'' Kevin, looking up from shoeing the cob, wipes a bead of sweat
from his brow and grins.
Most folk call him a blacksmith, although the proper term is farrier.
He points out that he doesn't make gates, all he does is shoe horses,
but there is more to the trade than meets the eye.
We are bouncing along a farm track to his next appointment, and he is
explaining the differences between cold and hot shoeing -- he carries a
portable, gas-fired forge in his land cruiser -- and between various
kinds of hand-made and factory-made shoes. There are fewer heavy working
horses nowadays, but there has been a big increase in the number of
privately-owned horses and ponies, which assures a steady supply of work
for himself and other farriers in the area.
The basic technique has not changed. ''First you take off the old
shoe, then you dress the foot, you fit a new shoe to the shape of the
foot, you fix it with nails, then you clench it up.'' Kevin pauses
thoughtfully, then says: ''It sounds like a pretty boring job when you
say it like that, doesn't it?''
One is inclined to agree, but Kevin insists that variety is the spice
of a farrier's life, as every horse, and every foot, is different.
''Also you have to be careful with young horses,'' he says. ''The last
thing you want when you're shoeing a pony for the first time is to give
it a bad experience and a bad memory.''
This caring attitude is acknowledged and appreciated at our next stop,
Old MacDonald's Farm, aka the home of Ian and Sarah Campbell and their
two children, seven horses, 18 dogs, six pups, five cats, two kittens,
and four ferrets (at the last count). There is no chance whatever of our
arrival going unnoticed.
Amid a cacophony of barking and yelping and neighing and meowing,
Kevin proceeds to hot-shoe Stuntman, an old racehorse from Newmarket
adopted by Sarah as a pet. As he disappears momentarily behind a cloud
of searing vapours, Sarah says: ''It's important for a blacksmith to
have a good temperament, as well as abilities. Kevin has an exceptional
way with young horses. He never clatters his tools like some other lads.
You can tell he came up through the pony club.''
It all seems like a rural idyll, but of course Ayrshire has its
problems like anywhere else -- notably high unemployment, which has
affected even the horsy set. A friend of Sarah's, who has just been made
redundant by a bank, says: ''The countryside looks nice, but it's hard
to enjoy if you've no job and no money.''
Government policies, or the lack of them, are of little concern to
Kevin. ''I don't know much about the way they run the country,'' he
says. ''I don't take much notice, to tell you the truth. I'm quite happy
with life in general.'' With disarming frankness, he adds: ''I never
listen to what the politicians say. They use a few big words and I'm
lost.''
Kevin knows quite a few big words that would be lost on most
politicians, unless they were familiar with equine ailments.
Accompanying this modest tradesman on his rounds, it quickly becomes
apparent that he knows a great deal more about horses than simply how to
fit them with new shoes. At every stop, he is consulted on how to deal
with hooves that are cracked, broken, brittle, and worn out.
Sarah Campbell says: ''When I got Stuntman, his feet were in a
terrible state, they were like sponges. Kevin's done wonders with
them.'' Later the owner of a grey gelding asks what she should do about
its badly chipped feet, and Kevin says deadpan: ''I've got a gun in the
car.'' Then he gives detailed instructions on how to tackle the problem.
He assumes he is earning a decent wage from a minimum 65-hour working
week, but he is not sure. In fact, he does not have the faintest idea
how much he makes: ''It all goes to my mum, and then to an accountant. I
wouldn't have a clue where to start with that book-keeping stuff.''
One day soon, he hopes to build a smiddy so he can make his own
horseshoes. Then he'll take on an apprentice, and pass on his skills to
the next generation, thereby ensuring the survival of an ancient
tradition.
The only thing missing in his life at the moment is a girl who ended a
long-standing relationship a year ago. Her photograph is still on his
mantelpiece, and her motor-cycle is still in his garage, so maybe one
day she will return. Perhaps she should -- having moved into his cottage
shortly after they separated, Kevin has only just figured out how the
oven works.
In the meantime, he is content to meet a few friends for a drink on a
Saturday night, and join them for a spin on the bikes on a Sunday if
he's not working. He doesn't need much company in the evening, having no
shortage of it during his long working days. ''One of the good things
about this job is that a lot of your customers become like friends,'' he
says.
It is early evening before the last horse of the day is shod, and soon
it will be dark. We are driving along a quiet country road in the
gloaming when a big car approaches, and Kevin says: ''There's the
sheriff. I used to shoe his donkeys.'' A distinguished figure in a blue
Rolls-Royce spots Kevin, and waves a friendly greeting.
It is Friday night, and the judge looks as if he is going out to
dinner or perhaps the theatre. Kevin is going home to sort out the
horseshoes he will be needing early in the morning.

Technology hopes to unlock some of the mysteries behind Jupiter's
third largest moon, Io, this year as John Fowler and illustrator Mark
McLellan explain
BY OUR earthly standards, Io is a very angry place, always blowing its
top. Io, the third largest of the planet Jupiter's Galilean moons, has a
rare distinction: it is believed to be the most volcanically active body
in the solar system. Its surface is in a constant tizzy. From its plouky
face hundreds of craters regularly belch out not the good old
Vesuvius-type lava that we know, but a sulphurous concoction. Hence the
orange tinge to Io's complexion.
Soon we hope to learn more about Io. At this moment a probe released
by the spacecraft Galileo is homing in on Jupiter and on December 7 it
will be in position to take a good look at Io. Mark McLellan's
illustration gives an impression of the view arounf Jupiter and Io.
The anonymous probe -- for no-one has thought to give it one of those
snappy Star Trek names that seek to domesticate space technology for us
-- will then continue its parachute descent through Jupiter's cloudy
lining. Meanwhile thrusters will brake the parent craft, allowing
Jupiter's gravitational force to hoick it into orbit. As Galileo
circuits the planet it will receive information beamed up from the
probe.
Mark's October star chart shows the constellation Cetus, which is
visible throughout the night low in the southern sky. Cetus is a large
dollop somewhat thinly spread, and since it contains no very bright
stars it is not easily pinpointed.
Within Cetus is Mira, a star described as a variable because its
brightness fluctuates. This star has lent its name to a wide variety of
other variable stars, which are therefore classed generically as Mira
variables -- a mite confusing, is it not? Because of its variation in
magnitude (the astronomical term used to measure brightness) Mira can be
seen only a few weeks in every year.
Mira is a red giant, or star which is expanding after having exhausted
its fuel. At one time Mira may have been much like our sun, but it has
ballooned enormously and is a lot cooler (and therefore red, as in the
glow of dying embers).
Mark's diagram shows the giant elliptical galaxy known as M77 (nothing
to do with tree people and choleric MPs hefting pickaxes). Galaxies are
archipelagos of stars in space and they come in various shapes and
sizes. Most galaxies are spirals with a bulge in the centre, composed of
so many clustered objects that it cannot be penetrated optically. For
information we have to rely on radio waves.
Because the whorl of M77 is tilted, to our eyes it appears as
elliptical. Radio telescopes pick up a strong pulse from M77 which may
indicate the presence of a black hole at its centre.
Another interesting galaxy visible this month is M31, better known as
the Andromeda Galaxy. This too is elliptical and it seems to be very
similar to our own galaxy. It is very large and on a clear frosty night,
such as we can expect in October, it may be visible even to the naked
eye, though only as a blur. You should have better luck with binoculars.

William Russell spends a weekend in the elegance of Dinard in France
and returns with a healthy prognosis for the British film industry
THE British film industry is alive, well, and has just spent a long
weekend in Dinard. Why did 80 of Britain's leading film producers,
several up-and-coming directors, and a handful of actors descend for
four days on this beautiful, still elegant belle epoque resort in
Brittany with its micro-climate, palm trees, spectacular cliffs, and
houses built by the rich at the turn of the century with spires,
turrets, and gothic decorations in which Norman Bates would have felt at
home? Not to play golf, although some of them do play the game -- and
not very well either, because in the competition with their French
counterparts the French won, as they have done four years out of six.
The reason for the visit was the Sixth Festival du Film Britannique
run by Dinard, which provides a showcase for some of the best British
films of the past year and an opportunity, according to first-time
attender David Puttnam, for producers to discuss co-production deals.
What happens during the next five years would affect the future of the
European film industry, Puttnam said. How these developed would decide
whether Europe, particularly if the British and French industries worked
together, could take on the American giant.
The British connection with Dinard goes back a long way. There is a
handsome bronze plaque on the promenade recording the centenary of the
arrival of the first British residents -- put up in 1936. The festival,
financed primarily by Dinard and the local department, attracts some
10,000 people to the town during its four-day run and brings the British
contingent over on a charter flight. Primarily a tourist attraction
aimed at extending the town's holiday season, the festival is widely
publicised in France, although little known in Britain.
The British film industry benefits because the films on show all open
later this year in France and the festival prizes, which went to Peter
Chelsom's Funny Bones and Michael Winterbottom's Butterfly Kiss, will
help at the box-office. As will the best acting prize, which went to
Saskia Reeves and Amanda Plummer who played the homicidal lesbians in
the latter film, and the overall publicity.
Chelsom's film, as well as winning the top jury prize, the Golden
Hitchcock, a statuette of the great man with two birds on his shoulders,
a reference both to his most celebrated film and the massive pale fawn
gulls that lurk on Dinard's beaches, won the audience prize -- proof to
its distributor of its popular appeal. There were six films in
competition, as well as several out of competition getting their French
premieres. The competition films selected by the festival's director,
Marc Ruscart, himself a film director currently shooting a film in
Tbilisi with Charlotte Rampling, were Butterfly Kiss, Funny Bones, Jack
and Sarah, i.d., Three Steps to Heaven, and The Englishman who Went up a
Hill but Came Down a Mountain.
Taken as a whole they presented a singular picture of Britain for the
French to digest, showing a land where homicidal lesbians roam the
motorways around Blackpool, in which bad comedians ply their trade,
while in the south wealthy male single parents in Islington bring up
baby by marrying the nannie and everyone ignores the football hooligans,
especially Hugh Grant who does what he always does in films, and real
life, exuding the sort of raffish charm which the French regard as truly
English.
The festival opened with a hugely successful gala screening of The
Madness of King George, a film which the French considered summed up
everything British, and to which Alan Bennett, looking out of his
element, turned up. The other premieres were of Land and Freedom, Ken
Loach's drama set during the Spanish Civil War, Circle of Friends, a
whimsical story of Irish young love based on a Maeve Binchy novel, and
The Young Poisoner's Handbook, about a serial killer in Neasden.
For French and British alike, however, the films which hit home most
were those in the retrospective devoted to films made by Alexander Korda
both as producer and director.
What was most impressive was the sheer scale of the likes of The
Jungle Book, The Four Feathers, The Private Life of Henry VIII, Lady
Hamilton -- the French sat bemused through its purple passages in which
Napoleon is likened to Hitler, their fleet is detroyed at Trafalgar, and
Nelson delivers a ringing propaganda message about how dictators must be
resisted and only England, standing alone, can do it -- and Tolstoy's
Anna Karenina. The sets were lavish, there were casts of thousands, and
all of them stood the test of time.
Those were the days when Britain, as well as having a flourishing film
industry, also had real film stars. Vivien Leigh's Lady Hamilton was a
triumphant performance adored by the audience, and even her Karenina,
which had to cope with a truly awful performance from her leading man,
Kieron Moore, moved them, while in several of the other films Robert
Donat showed up today's leading men for the wimps that they are. Eat
your heart out, Hugh baby, Bob is better than you will ever be.
Donat starred in one rarity, Korda's Knight Without Armour, a
splendidly coincidence-clogged spy story set during the Russian
Revolution, playing a rather incompetent British agent who, having spent
four years in Siberia, is released when the revolution comes and saves a
Russian countess, Marlene Dietrich, from the red mob. He smuggles her to
freedom and they fall in love.
The great cinematographer and director, Jack Cardiff, who worked on
that and other Korda films, more or less sabotaged Dietrich's
performance by revealing before the screening that she had a tip tilted
nose which she hated.
To conceal it Dietrich would paint a broad white line down the middle
of her nose and make sure she was never photographed in profile. Blow
me, there on screen -- the film was shot in black and white -- was the
proof. Marlene had a huge white line down her nose.
She and Donat did not get on, Cardiff said, and Donat got very annoyed
by the way she would hog the camera. She insisted a mirror be positioned
beside the lens so she could see herself to judge her appearance. Donat
decided he must have one too and while Dietrich preened he would adjust
the set of his sleeves.
According to Rebecca O'Brien, producer of Land and Freedom, the
weekend served another purpose apart from allowing her to meet her
French peers and discuss the problems of co-production. Oddly there is
no common meeting ground in Britain where British producers can
socialise, and Dinard provides them with it. Because none of them is
there seeking finance or pushing a film, the atmosphere is relaxed
without competition. They talk about what they've done, what they will
be doing, and problems that have arisen.
Sally Hibbin, who has produced several of Ken Loach's other films,
including Raining Stones and Ladybird, Ladybird, said they would be
starting work on his new movie next month in Glasgow. It has the working
title of Carla's Song, although it could end up in the cinema as Crystal
Spirit. Written by Paul Laverty, the story opens in Glasgow. The unit
will be filming there from November 20 for a month before moving to
Nicaragua in January. As usual the actors do not know what is going to
happen to them, but the basic storyline concerns a Glasgow bus conductor
who helps one of his passengers, a Nicaraguan refugee who cannot pay her
fare, falls in love with her, and returns with her to her homeland to
help her face up to the demons in her past.
Dinard has been good to Scottish films and film-makers. In 1991
Gillies Mackinnon won the top prize for The Grass Arena, and last year
the Golden Hitchock went to Shallow Grave. Like all festivals it has its
financial worries, but the audiences are building up steadily, although
the quality of the films in competition each year lies in the lap of the
gods. The retrospective is a surer bet, and next year, all being well,
it will be devoted to the films of James Ivory and Ishmail Merchant.
Chances are the British will be travelling to Dinard for a long time
to come.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has intervened to force a climbdown
on toll charges for certain vehicles using the Skye bridge.
The concession means that vans used by crofters, small businesses, and
tradesmen -- who were facing a 300% increase in charges to cross the
Kyle of Lochalsh when the bridge opens on October 16 -- will now cross
as cars.
Last night, however, Mrs Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the Skye Bridge
Appeal Group, said: ''I am not jumping for joy just because the Scottish
Office and the Skye Bridge Company have climbed down over the
classification of vans. We are just wondering if this is the one
concession they always meant to make.
''But it is a first, the first time they have listened to the people
of Skye on anything to do with tolls. The pity is that it will probably
be the last time.''
Last week, the chief executive of Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise, Mr
Lorne MacLeod, met Scottish Office officials to highlight the problem
facing those who operate smaller commercial vans on the island.
Under the detailed toll regime for the bridge published three weeks
ago, the owners of Low Goods Vehicles (LGVs between 1.5T and 3.5T axle
weight) would have to pay #9.80 to cross the bridge summer and winter,
and #9.51 if a book of 10 discount tickets was bought. No mention was
made of vehicle length.
The vans will now cross for the same price as cars, #5.20 in the
summer and #4.20 in the winter, and #2.44 with the discount offered on a
book of 10 tickets.
At present, on the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, all vehicles up to 5
metres in length are classified as cars, regardless of weight, and cross
for #5.40 or #3.10 with discount tickets.
Yesterday, the Scottish Office said that Mr Forsyth had now
''clarified'' the position. What he had done, in fact, was to introduce
the first length classification into the bridge's toll structure to get
around the problem of the LGVs.
Mr Forsyth said: ''Skye Bridge Ltd and the Scottish Office clarified
today that light goods vehicles up to 5.5 metres long, which includes
the standard Transit-type van, would cross the bridge at the price of a
car.
''I am delighted to confirm that the company is replicating as closely
as possible the tariffs charged by Caledonian MacBrayne on the Kyle
ferry crossing. This was always the intention.''

MRS Rosemary West heard prosecuting counsel yesterday accuse her of
joining her husband in a horrific catalogue of killings, torture, and
sexual abuse on vulnerable young girls.
She remained unemotional in the dock, save for a brief moment when she
wiped away tears with a tissue.
At least two of her alleged victims could well have been kept alive,
bound and gagged, for days for the sexual gratification of Mrs West and
her husband Frederick, found dead in a prison cell on January 1,
Winchester Crown Court was told.
Some of Mrs West's alleged 10 murder victims had been snatched while
hitch-hiking before being taken to 25 Cromwell Street where they were
subjected to depraved sexual abuse before being killed, Mr Brian Leveson
QC prosecuting told the jury of eight men and four women.
Seven had been gagged with masking tape, their own clothing, or a belt
to prevent them screaming out as they underwent sexual attacks, Mr
Leveson said.
He described how forensic scientists discovered that the victims had
been naked, dismembered, decapitated, but many bones -- largely from the
feet and hands -- were missing when one by one their tiny graves were
excavated in the cellar and garden at Cromwell Street.
Each was dumped without dignity or respect in a different small hole
some three feet below the ground in the garden, in the cellar, and
underneath a bathroom.
Among the alleged victims were the Wests' oldest daughter Heather, who
disappeared just before her 17th birthday and Charmaine, Frederick
West's Scots-born stepdaughter. She disappeared at the age of eight.
Five of the bodies were recovered from the Cromwell Street cellar
where they had been buried clockwise in a ring.
What police discovered when they began digging was more terrible than
words can express, said Mr Leveson.
The court was told that Rosemary and Frederick West went out cruising,
driving around, to pick up hitch-hikers. All of them were young women or
girls and most of them with vulnerable backgrounds.
In this fashion they picked up a girl, Caroline Owens, and persuaded
her to become their nannie. After she had left this job she was once
more picked up by the Wests.
She was then sexually abused in the back of the vehicle by Mrs West
and eventually knocked senseless by the husband. When she recovered
consciousness she was bound and gagged and driven to Cromwell Street
where she was sexually abused overnight by both Wests.
Caroline survived, the Crown said, but she informed on the Wests, who
were subsequently fined for the assault.
They could not take the chance with other victims, said Mr Leveson.
''Those whom the Wests believed would not complain -- perhaps because
their involvement appeared to be willing or perhaps by their very
vulnerability as personalities -- lived,'' he said.
''Those whom it was believed posed a threat -- perhaps because of
their injuries or perhaps because they might talk to the police and
report what happened -- did not. Death was the option for them.''
Mr Leveson insisted that the events taking place at Cromwell Street
must have been known to Rosemary West. Over and above, she must have
been a willing and enthusiastic participant, he declared.
He said there were two additional killings, but it was not alleged Mrs
West was involved. They were of Charmaine's mother Rena and Scots-born
babyminder Ann McFall.
Mr Leveson began by telling the jury that Heather had lived with her
parents and stepsisters initially at 25 Midland Road and then at 25
Cromwell Street in Gloucester.
In June 1987, when she was 16, she disappeared. Her parents did not
report her missing. The reason was simple: they knew she was dead
because both had been involved in killing her, the court heard. Mr
Leveson said those who asked were told she had left home.
Eventually, in 1992, when police inquired, Mrs West said she had heard
from Heather on the telephone. On February 24 last year, armed with a
search warrant, police went to 25 Cromwell Street.
Two days later, under the patio which had been laid in the back
garden, they unearthed a skeleton. The skull had been hacked from the
spine; bones had been chopped to reduce the area into which the skeleton
could be forced; bones were missing.
It was Heather West.
There was a subsequent inquiry on life at 25 Cromwell Street. Other
girls who came and went over the years spoke of violent and degrading
sexual activity.
The police also carried out investigations at 25 Midland Road. Mr and
Mrs West lived there with Heather and her stepsisters in a one-bedroom
flat. One, Charmaine, had not been seen since 1971.
Underneath what was now the kitchen at Midland Road, but in 1971 was a
cellar under a bathroom, police found another skeleton with missing
bones. It was a small girl, and the Crown alleged it was the remains of
Charmaine.
''For her death also, the Crown allege that this defendant is
responsible,'' said Mr Levenson.
It was not suggested that she acted alone in the 10 counts of murder
of which she had been charged.
As to the nine found at Cromwell Street, she acted with Frederick
West; they were in it together, said the prosecuting counsel. As far as
Charmaine was concerned, the Crown suggested Rosemary West probably
acted on her own. Frederick West had been in prison at around the time
of the girl's disappearance and likely death.
Mr Leveson cautioned the jury that the picture he would paint,
revealed by the evidence, was both horrific and harrowing.
At the core of the case was the relationship between Frederick and
Rosemary West -- what they each knew about each other, what they did
together, what they did to others and how far each was prepared to go.
''Both were obsessed with sex,'' said Mr Leveson.
By the summer of 1971 the Wests had moved to Midland Road. There the
Wests told a neighbour of the way they picked up girls hitch-hiking.
Counsel then described how over the years Mr West had carried out many
alterations at Cromwell Street. These began when the first of many
bodies was buried.
He said in little more than two years following the original abduction
and sexual assault on Caroline Owens in 1972 no less than six girls, one
after the other, met their death each in very similar if not absolutely
identical circumstances.
He told the jury they would hear evidence from other girls. There was
one whom he called Miss A, who in about 1975 at the age of 13 was placed
in care in Gloucester. She recalls visiting 25 Cromwell Street, and
meeting the Wests.
Later, when she was 15 she returned to Cromwell Street, and there
followed incidents with two other girls, in which they and Miss A were
naked. Limbs were taped, and sexual acts were committed, involving both
Wests, he said.
The court was told that in November, 1988, a woman Kathryn Halliday,
who lived at 11 Cromwell Street came into contact with Frederick West.
She was bi-sexual. Within minutes of walking into 25 Cromwell Street,
Mrs West had taken off all her clothes and the three of them went to a
bedroom where Mr West recorded what they did on video.
There followed daily visits and Mrs Halliday was shown whips and hoods
and on occasions she was tied to the bed and blindfolded. Their
behaviour became more and more violent, but ended when Mrs Halliday felt
the activities were going beyond her physical and emotional limits.
Mr Leveson said these events were highly material when it was
considered what Mrs West must have known about those who were brought to
Cromwell Street and buried there.
''It is that knowledge and the fact that we are dealing with events
over 15 years which drives to the conclusion that she fully participated
and bears a full measure of responsibility.''
The case continues.

When movie makers need a woman who is cool, stylish, dignified,
independent, and foxy, they don't have to call Central Casting. Douglas
Thompson spends some time with Catherine Deneuve, the timeless face of
France
GERARD Depardieu has a decided view on his country's national living
treasure, the French perfection who has retained her independence for
more than half-a-century: ''Catherine Deneuve is the man I'd like to
be.'' Catherine the Great. The icy cool flawless face of France -- and
over the years Chanel and Yves St Laurent -- has resolutely remained her
own person. However, some family named Rothschild is allowed to advise
her on investments.
She is 52 years old, It is not a landmark age, but it's an important
fact because somehow she appears more beautiful than ever -- for once as
much a cosmic rather than cosmetic miracle. Men and women don't look at
her. They stare, initially at least. She disdains social circuit duty --
''I sense people are looking at me and not listening to me'' -- but
enjoys parties with her friends, gossiping over beer and wine.
Over the years the beauty has blurred some perceptions of the career
that has been long (her debut was in Les Collegiennes at age 13) and
distinguished (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, Repulsion, The Last Metro,
and 1967's Belle de Jour, which was re-released this year) involving
more than 60 films. Two years ago she was a contender for the Best
Actress Oscar for Indochine. Not Best Foreign Actress, but Best Actress;
in Hollywood, that is a huge distinction.
Only a handful of her films have made an impact outside Europe and, of
course, most famously, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964). Director
Jacques Demy told a simple story of the young girl who becomes pregnant,
is abandoned, marries another man, and many spins of the clock later
drives into a garage to find the attendant is her child's father.
Deneuve became a symbol of young love -- and young loss. A Gallic James
Dean. She has retained the image as well as her looks.
Thirty years on she was at the Cannes Film Festival this year with her
latest film, The Convent. With David Bowie in 1983's The Hunger, she was
an unquenchable vampire. This is an upgrade. She is the Devil. The man
doing a Faustian deal with her is the always worrying, strange John
Malkovich, a man who emotes goosepimples. It is a clever combination of
the leading lady of France with arguably America's most interesting
actor. At the helm was Portuguese veteran director Manoel de Oliveria,
who is 86. In Deneuve circles, age appears an irrelevance.
Her escort at Cannes was her daughter Chiara-Charlotte, 24, from her
liaison (1971-75) with Marcello Mastroianni. She has a son Christian,
30, from her involvement (1961-64) with Roger Vadim, who launched Bardot
and married Fonda. She was 18 when she met Vadim who, would later write
something of a kiss 'n' tell. Of him, she says only: ''He is the father
of my son.'' She remains friends with David Bailey, her husband from
1965 to 1970. There is no tittle-tattle about any of that.
On her relationships, all she will offer is: ''There is no such thing
as a home-wrecker, a femme fatale. Some men are available.''
Deneuve is economical. In her words. In her movement. She walks --
well, it's really a stride -- with all the confidence of a thoroughbred.
She impresses just entering a room. She rarely ventures out publicly
unless it is to bang the drum for St Laurent (''he's very shy -- I try
to help him relax'') or for a film like her present release The Convent,
or Indochine, which is one of her best.
That big, dramatic love story, set during the Indochina War of the
1930s, was one of those effective epics in that it was as involving as
it was sweeping. It involved Deneuve as a cool, stylish, dignified,
independent, foxy, and determined (they didn't have to call Central
Casting) landowner who falls in love with a French naval officer. The
complication is that her 16-year-old daughter does, too. Echoes again of
love and loss.
She has replaced Bardot as Marianne, the symbol of the French
Republic, and is one of her country's most admired women. ''She's
definitely still one of the few pop stars in France,'' composer Jean-Luc
Ponty said. By that he meant icon.
In those glossy magazine advertisements she has an ice maiden look. In
the gossip columns she is often described as ''cold.'' On one of these
rare occasions when she agreeed to be asked about her films and,
reluctantly, herself, she was quizzed about this chilly image. A warning
glance and then: ''I can be cold. If people try to be irritating or
indiscreet or vulgar or anything like that I can become cold just to
stop them from going any further. I think I can be cold as a protection.
Sometimes in public people who don't know don't realise I am very
nervous. I can look quite cold just trying to behave. And it's my
physical appearance.''
Yes, well, this is a woman who is superb. Only 21-year-olds who feel
immortal could fault her beauty today. Her hair is fashionably cut down
and shows more of her face which, of course, has lines. She is shorter
and has bigger hips than you expect. The quick talking and thinking are
less of a surprise. The impatience is expected. But she answers the
obvious questions:
''Life is easier for a good-looking woman, but that good life starts
so young you don't notice it. When you are young and someone says you
have style and are good-looking it's a compliment, and that's very nice.
''Then looking beautiful becomes a challenge. And then a pressure.
''People are never that bright and beautiful and successful. That, you
know, is just one side of the story. That's the moon side, but there's
always a darker side to everybody. There is a hidden part that I have
got.''
Her dark side?
''If we had to make a pact and live together maybe I would warn you
about my defects, but I don't see why I should tell you my defects.''
Weaknesses? ''To be very nervous. But I'm also very independent. I
think a woman, no matter what she does, becomes very independent. She is
suited to managing by herself. It doesn't mean you are alone, but when
you are used to really living your life, carrying your life and making
decisions for yourself, you get used to being independent. It can be a
defect.''
Is this a pact? ''I will be leaving you in half-an-hour.''
What she finds defective is those who chart her every wrinkle. ''I'm
sensitive to it, but I've learned to live with it. What would be cruel
for me is if someone would write that I still look like I did at 25. I
would like to have stayed 35 for a long time, but I tell myself that's
the way it is. To pretend I don't have any wrinkles or that I am someone
else would bring on more pressures.
''You cannot be over 40 and pretend to be 25, but you can work at
it.''
There is no smug shrug when you get into that some people have to
''work at it'' harder than others. She grins: ''I drink blood for
breakfast.''
Maybe she does. It sounds better than Sarah Miles drinking her own
pee. But can she be serious? Pretty please?
An eyelash flutters. She credits her genes. Her mother, Renee Deneuve,
and father, Maurice Dorleac, were both members of the Comedie Francaise.
She followed her older sister Francoise Dorleac into films. Francoise
died in a car accident in 1967, a year after the sisters starred for
Demy in Les Demoiselles de Rochefort. Earlier this year Deneuve went to
Rochefort to attend a commemoration ceremony for the film -- and to
remember her sister.
''Since she was my sister and we did the same work I could say things
to her that I couldn't say to anyone else. I suppose I could have met
another actress and become friends, but it would have been difficult
because the most important part of that relationship was that there was
no rivalry.
''If you have shared things as children, evolved together, you don't
have to say things, you can guess and interpret because you can enter
the other's imaginary world. We were very, very close.
''People's voices are so important, and when I see films she's in it's
always the voice that gets me. You don't remember the voices of the
dead, you usually just see photographs of them.''
She changes her thoughts to her mother: ''She looks very good. She's
very strong and healthy, and I suppose it's in the genes. Frankly, I
really do.
''I quit smoking a few years ago and my skin was not bad, but I think
that has helped to keep my skin good. I just stopped smoking cigarettes
because I was scared I was smoking too much. It was time I should get
scared. I try to get my hours for sleeping, and when I'm not working I
like to spend time with people I like very much so I will have a nice
time. I really try hard on that! And I drink blood every day . . .
''No, when I diet I really have to watch it. And I had to watch it
when I quit smoking. I'm very nervous and move a lot, I'm always around,
always on my feet. My daughter calls me 'Wonder Woman' because I never
stop moving, going one way or the other. But I do exercise when I'm not
shooting a picture. I love to walk. I don't like to run. I like to go to
the beach, but not to take the sun or anything like that but just go to
feel the sea, the sand. Physical pleasures like that give me joy.
''I think beauty is in someone's eyes. Beauty can be both an asset and
a danger. But now I see beauty as helping a woman to act a certain age,
to grow old better, Consciousness of beauty isn't just face, but also
health. You're forced to get up and do something in the morning to look
right. It's survival in a certain way.
''Women are younger, in a sense, than they used to be. They grow old
better. Taking care of yourself has a lot to do with it. I drink a lot
of water and avoid sugar and alcohol, although that doesn't mean I don't
enjoy a drink. I think the best beauty treatment is sleep.''
If her genetic theory is correct, she'll be around until she's
eighty-something like her mother. ''At 80? Maybe I'll be like Katharine
Hepburn or maybe I'll be retiring in the south of France. I don't know,
really I don't. I'll tell you when I get there.
''The huge advantage I have over other actresses is my stamina. I have
a great deal of physical strength, resistance. It's genetic. The
differences between actresses who fall apart and those who don't is
simply health and the quality of their energy.''
There's also quality in her style. And a frankness when she talks
about ageing. Or other people talking about her ageing: ''They talk
about 'fragile beauty.' It's a way of saying how touching it is to see
the shadows beneath the eyes, the first wrinkles. I want to tell them to
get lost. There is nothing beautiful about that.''
''I resent the fact that a woman's beauty becoming vulnerable should
make her more beautiful. I don't like the tone of emotion applied to the
fragility of the texture of skin beneath the eye. It's as if they're
saying: 'Finally, she's human.' ''
Which, of course, they are.
Even she admits to concerns: ''I have my days when I feel better and
some days when I still doubt myself very much.''
Catherine Deneuve is, it seems, a lady who haunts herself. It is
difficult to imagine anyone else being able to.
