WHILE Celtic's trawl around northern Europe for players has already
produced one prominent Dutch signing, the less-publicised trips to have
a look in Spain's shop window might also turn out to be productive.
Sources on the Continent suggest that the Parkhead club has been
looking at three players who earn their living in Spain, although none
of them is Spanish.
The best-known is the man who caused a huge stir at the World Cup,
Russia's Oleg Salenko, scorer of five goals in his team's win over
Cameroon in the USA last summer -- the only man to have hit five in a
single game in the World Cup finals. He plays for Valencia but is said
to be keen to try British football and the price that may be required is
not beyond Celtic, at around #2.75m.
If the Russian player, who is 25, is the Parkhead target, he would be
the first from that country to be sought by Celtic but his style of play
might well be an ideal foil for Pierre van Hooydonk, who has made a fine
impact since he arrived from Breda FA for #1.2m.
Salenko, who went to the USA only as a back-up player for the Russians
but ended up with six goals, was much sought after following the World
Cup but elected to stick with Valencia.
He almost certainly is one of the men watched by Parkhead chief scout
Davie Hay during his travels, but there were two other likely candidates
for Hay's notebook and both have reputations which would make them
welcome in Scotland.
The fact that Ajax wanted 22-year-old Slovenian internationalist Peter
Dubovsky is a big enough recommendation for any player and, although the
man with Real Madrid has not been able to win a regular place in their
front-line, he is faced with enormous competition.
Ajax wanted him to replace Denis Bergkamp but stepped back from the
chase when the striker seemed set for a first-team role with Real. Now,
he is available again and at #1.2m would be well within Celtic's
spending power.
The third man watched in Spain is believed to have been Seville
striker Davio Sucer, who scored two goals for Croatia in their victory
over Italy in a European Championship qualifying match.
Sucer, 27, and valued at #2.5m, is the most experienced of the trio
and is at the peak of his scoring powers.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns said yesterday that he would only move when
he could get the man, or men, he wanted. ''It can take time to do these
things and sometimes clubs are not desperate to release important
players.''
Burns also dismissed reports that Andy Walker might be returning
south. ''I know nothing about that and, as far as I'm concerned, Andy
will stay here.''

THE former Scotland captain David Sole had a theory about the Irish.
The 1990 Grand Slam skipper reckoned that even when they were down in
the dumps, the men from the Emerald Isle always had one good game in
them a season.
Ireland come to Murrayfield today with a revamped side after
disappointment against England at Lansdowne Road a fortnight ago so, if
Sole is correct, they still have that ''one good game'' to come.
Scotland, under skipper Gavin Hastings, who today sets a Scottish cap
record of 53 appearances, will be going hell-for-leather to ensure that
Ireland peak not today but perhaps against the Welsh or French further
along their Five Nations' Championship trail.
Today the Scots who ended the national side's run of nine games
without a win by beating Canada two weeks ago -- and who were chosen en
bloc to tilt the lance against the Irish -- will set about affirming
selectorial faith with, they hope, a repeat performance against Michael
Bradley's men.
By contrast, the Irish selectors burned much midnight oil before
making six changes and a positional switch to the team which succumbed
to England. And on Wednesday night full back Jim Staples -- recalled to
the side in place of Conor O'Shea, who had a disappointing game against
England -- fell victim to flu. O'Shea got his reprieve and bounced back
into the senior side from the Ireland A team, to which he had been
relegated.
Yesterday, as the Scots trained at Currie's Malleny Park ground, there
was an air of confidence about them. Coach Dougie Morgan said: ''Canada
represented the first rung of the ladder and the win has done so much
for the players' confidence. We're not over-confident but there's been a
different atmosphere at the sessions since that win.''
However, the need to win, and to do so convincingly and attractively
in front of today's sell-out 67,500 crowd, remains as significant a
priority as ever. Skipper Hastings agrees. ''I don't think the pressure
is off at all. With all due respect to Canada, having achieved a victory
we recognise that we have to go on and achieve wins in the Five
Nations.''
Ireland have not won at Murrayfield since 1985 but coach Gerry Murphy
sets no great store by the lessons of history.
He also explained why the Irish team went AWOL in Edinburgh yesterday
when they were to have trained at Boroughmuir's Meggetland ground but
failed to turn up. Murphy said that his side had spent so much time
training on heavy grounds in Dublin over the past couple of days that
they had opted for an indoor session at a local school elsewhere in the
capital. ''We just did some light work in the hall at Broughton High
School,'' he explained.
Like Ireland, Scotland bring some fresh faces to Murrayfield and with
them comes the new-look rucking game plus the integral and
''interesting'' centre partnership of heavy-hitting Ian Jardine and the
fleet-of-foot Gregor Townsend.
A win remains the priority but the Murrayfield masses will be
disappointed if the Scots do not serve up some entertainment along the
way. Townsend, in particular, needs a good game today if his undoubted
and mercurial talent is not to be filed under ''what might have been.''
There is a notion abroad, too, that today's game represents the second
division of the Five Nations' Championship, a contest to decide the
destination of the wooden spoon. It was a point which was made yesterday
by a Sassenach scribe at the squad session press conference.
Hastings swatted the notion aside. ''That's an interesting perception,
but I'm not much interested in what the papers south of the Border have
to say,'' he declared.
The manager, Duncan Paterson, restricted his comments to his captain's
occasion: ''With his record cap outing it's a great day, a historic day,
and one which Gavin is well deserving of. I'm sure his family and his
club and everybody will be very proud indeed tomorrow.''
Much depends today on the collective performance of the Scotland front
row. Hilton, Milne, and Wright will have to be on their mettle if they
are to settle the hash of the much-vaunted Irish trio Popplewell, Wood,
and Clohessy. In the front row are games won and lost, and if the
Irishmen get the nudge then it will be a case of ''emergency stations''
in the Scots' back row and beyond.
Murphy admitted that Irish confidence was not high and that they had a
problem of inconsistency. The coach focused, too, on the selection of
Denis McBride at open-side wing-forward. At 5ft 10in, McBride is small
for an international flanker but he is that endangered species, a
genuine tearaway ''loosie'' who can cause havoc if he gets in among the
opposition threequarters. However, Murphy said: ''We're not really
looking for him to be a major force at the tail of the lineout. He's in
the side for other reasons. He's a very fine and experienced open-side
flanker.''
Did this mean then that Ireland would be playing a wide-ranging,
expansive game? ''If we did, then it would be the first time in 100
years that Ireland would be playing an expansive game. No, we'll just be
playing our normal game.''
Which, he said with a mischievous smile that would have done a
leprechaun proud, was ''kicking the ball up in the air and running after
it.'' Now there's blarney!

had been taken because of the exposure to the weather which the teams
had suffered prior to the Canada game.

Scotland A 24, Ireland A 18
TONY Stanger wanted to prove something to himself. His late, second
try which saved the game for the Scots may also have convinced
Scotland's top brass that he is capable of making the switch from the
wing to midfield and building on the 36 caps that he has already won,
writes Derek Douglas.
Stanger still has years of international rugby left in him and his
decision to say that he did not want to play on the wing any longer paid
off at Myreside yesterday with two tries and a more than satisfactory
all-round performance of the duties of a centre-threequarter.
''I wanted to prove to myself that I could play in the centre at
representative level,'' he said.
Scotland A coach David Johnston added that it was not for him to say
whether or not Stanger would be but a fleeting visitor to the ranks of
his shadow side but he, too, was full of praise for the Hawick man.
''He performed well. He was the match-winner with two fines tries,
both from good lead-up work in broken play.''
Stanger's midfield partner Scott Hastings also did his chances of a
recall no harm with a solid performance. He supplied the scoring pass
for Stanger's second try and also was instrumental in denying the Irish
a try, when Pat Murray was held up over the line.
Scotland played with a stiff breeze at their backs in the first half
and seemed content to let the wind do the work. They led 9-8 at the
interval, Stuart Laing's three penalty goals just keeping the heads
above water in relation to Alan McGowan's penalty and Richard Wallace's
well-taken try.
In the second half, the Scots raised their work-rate but had to claw
their way back after a drop goal by McGowan.
Stanger's first try put them ahead but, nine minutes from the end,
Mark McCall punished slack Scottish defence with a try which Niall
Malone converted.
Stuart Laing's penalty goal brought the Scots within a point of
Ireland and that seemed to be it. But Stanger's try and Laing's
conversion silenced the Irish.
Scotland A -- R Shepherd (Edinburgh Academy); H Gilmour (Heriot's FP),

SCOTLAND'S Drew Henry, the world No.39 from Rutherglen, yesterday won
three of the last four frames to score a 5-4 victory over England's Andy
Hicks in the quarter-finals of the Nescafe WPBSA Tour event in Thailand.
Hicks, the world No.33 from Tavistock, led 2-1 and 3-2, but only
scored seven points in the next two frames as Henry, with breaks of 35
and 52, went 4-3 ahead.
In a see-saw match, Hicks, up to No.20 in the provisional rankings,
levelled at 4-4 with a break of 68, but Henry won the shoot-out frame
138-0 with a break of 62. Other quarter-final results:

EIGHT teams take the ice at Perth today, each rink hoping to secure
one of the last two available places in next month's finals of the
Macallan Scottish Curling Championships. .
At last week's district playdowns, eight other teams gained finals
selection and this weekend's repechage -- or second chance -- tournament
gives a further opportunity to those teams that finished third and
fourth at each venue.
The repechage system has been introduced for the first time this
season, and among those relieved to see this innovation is pre-event
favourite Hammy McMillan, who surprisingly lost out last weekend.

NIGEL Mansell savoured a full-time return to Formula One racing
yesterday, then declared: ''It's like launching a new career.''
The 41-year-old former world and IndyCar champion, rejected by
Williams in favour of 23-year-old Scot David Coulthard, was named as
Marlboro McLaren's new driver for the 1995 season after long
negotiations which team boss Ron Dennis admitted had started
''catastrophically.''
The final sticking point was overcome when the pair agreed to donate a
disputed $100,000 to charities -- and Mansell will make his debut for
the team in the Brazilian Grand Prix on March 26.
He has signed an initial one-year deal worth around #5m -- half of
what he is said to have demanded -- and is convinced he can win a second
world title.
Mansell, who will share equal status with Finnish team-mate Mika
Hakkinen, added: ''The motivation is there like never before. I can feel
it, taste it, sense it and want it.
''If you have all those feelings and the fire is still burning, you
would be wrong to walk away.
''Some will say I'm the wrong side of 40. If that's the case, then I'm
carrying a banner for the over-40s.''

AFTER six defences amid passionate home town support at the Cardiff
Ice Rink, Steve Robinson would not be averse to widenening his horizons
to cash in on his World Boxing Organisation featherweight title.
He has seen off all the top domestic opposition in Cardiff -- as well
as the tough Latin Freddy Cruz -- since coming almost from nowhere 21
months ago to beat Newcastle's John Davison in his own territory and
claim this version of the 9st championship.
Tonight Argentina's Domingo Damigella should come nowhere near
wrecking Robinson's ambition of a lucrative unification fight some time
in 1995.
''If the money is right, I'd be prepared to travel,'' said Robinson.
''It's been my dream to fight somewhere like Las Vegas.''
Damigella, 27 this month, is a speedy boxer with a sound defence, but
only five stoppage wins out of 22 in a 24-fight record indicates that
Robinson's already sturdy chin will be under no threat.
The baby-faced Argentinian is not reckoned to be a strong fighter --
which Robinson most defintely is -- and could therefore be vulnerable to
the champion's forceful body attacks.

NOT that it will disturb Ivan Golac's composure -- that might need a
plague of locusts up his trouser leg -- but Rangers will have all the
big shots on duty for the visit of Dundee United to Ibrox this
afternoon.
Mark Hateley, Ally McCoist, and Gordon Durie are all fit and ready for
action after varying degrees of absence through injury.
McCoist has had the worst time, of course, having started only four
games this season after consistent problems with calf injuries, but
returned to the reserves in midweek and scored twice. He seems to be
ready this time and not only Rangers supporters will be hoping that his
problems are over.
He and Hateley rarely have had the chance to be together alongside the
season's star turn, Brian Laudrup, and the prospect of all three on top
form is exciting, if not for the opposition.
Manager Walter Smith has named a 19-strong pool, which includes three
goalkeepers, for the two games he faces in three days, the postponed
Tennents Scottish Cup tie with Hamilton at Firhill coming up on Monday.
The chances are that he will select his strongest team for the league
game and then see how he is placed afterwards. But one man who could
play this afternoon and miss Monday is Alex Cleland, who was signed from
Dundee United too late to be eligible for a cup place.
His former Dundee United team-mate, Gary Bollan, who was part of the
#750,000 deal which brought Cleland to Ibrox, is suspended and, thus,
misses his chance to take on his old pals in his first game.
Ibrox chairman David Murray confirmed last night that Rangers will be
spending very big money at the end of the season.
''We have had a few discussions with clubs and deals can be done if
the price is right,'' he said in a BBC Sportscene interview, ''and
Rangers fans know that we will come out fighting from our corner when
the time is right.''
Murray also repeated his view that by the year 2000 three or four
Scottish clubs will be involved in a European league in midweek and
their own, shorter, domestic league at the weekends.
United would like to be one of them but, for the moment, they have
more immediate concerns. They will not be pursuing their interest in
Portuguese player Quim, who played in a reserve match against Hearts on
Thursday.
''He is a good player,'' said Golac, ''but he is a sweeper and we are
well served there.''
The manager intends to head for Europe on a mission to find a midfield
player and an attacking full back.
Meantime, he has probably selected Jim McInally for the job of marking
Laudrup. ''Actually, I'm the best man for that job. It would be one that
I would have relished in my playing days,'' said the irrepressible one,
''but, in any case, we need to do it better than last time when Gary
Bollan and Alex Cleland tried it. They were given a hard time.''
Gordan Petric, who was missing on that occasion because of suspension,
will be back.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns was able to say that everybody in
contention for the game with Motherwell at Fir Park was available . . .
''and it is a long time since that was the case.''
The manager has to decide if captain Paul McStay, free of suspension,
should come back and that is not as easy as it might seem. The midfield
of Peter Grant, John Collins, and Phil O'Donnell has done well, with
Brian McLaughlin supplementing that trio when he is not busy on the
wing, and Burns is not afraid to leave out any name in the squad.
He has been happy with the 'new dimension' Pierre van Hooydonk has
given the squad and with the contribution Willie Falconer is making up
front. ''Motherwell are probably the best team we have faced this season
but our major concern will be how we perform ourselves.''
Motherwell are likely to be unchanged from the side that played for 52
minutes before the lights went out at Falkirk in midweek.
Falkirk hope to have the lights working without a hitch and Joe
McLaughlin fit to face Hearts a Brockville. Hearts have John Millar
suspended, as well as some doubtful starters, including Jim Bett and
Kevin Thomas.
Hibs are without two suspended midfielders, Michael O'Neill and David
Farrell, for their home meeting with Partick Thistle, who were informed
yesterday that Roddie Grant will have to go into hospital for an eye
operation and may be out for the rest of the season.
Kilmarnock will be without injured pair Mark Skilling and Colin McKee
but will have Robert Connor back after suspension for the game against
Aberdeen, who have Stewart McKimmie fit again.

BRIAN Marchbank and Paul Lawrie led the Scottish contingent after the
second round of the Madeira Island Open yesterday.
Marchbank carded a second round of 71, one better than the man from
Aberdeen, and the pair are on an aggregate of 140, but they still are
six strokes behind the leader, Santiago Luna.
The Spaniard matched his opening round of 67 to lead the event by two
strokes from Liam White at 10 under par, and two more rounds remain for
the Scots to improve their positions.
0 Luna carries the almost identikit profile of the rank-and-file
European professional -- 32 years old, 11 seasons on the Tour without a
victory, and his best finishes, three times fourth, all on his native
Spanish soil.
However, the eight-foot birdie putt on the home green he left four
inches short did not inspire confidence for his breakthrough.
In 36 holes Luna, one of an increasingly rare species who usues a
Persimmon-headed wood, has had one eagle, 13 birdies, and five bogeys
and his scoring of seven under par over the four long holes has been the
important contribution.
David A Russell finished 20 strokes behind the Spaniard and had a
poignant story to tell. The Kent-born professional, who is 37, is
undergoing treatment for cancer. He lost his US Tour card last season,
and is in effect existing on a tournament-to-tournament basis as the
illness allows.
He was not alone in yielding to the 6606-yard course, cunningly
constructed on a steep hillside to balance gainful opportunity with
potential disaster.
Thus scores ranged as variably as the weather changed from warm
sunshine to cool overcast, from 65 to 85, and East Kilbride's Craig
Ronald followed an outward 44 with 32 home.
Of the other Scots, only Ronald (153) and William Guy (147) did not
survive the 36-hole cut at 146 -- Andrew Coltart, Gordon Brand Jr, Dean
Roberts, Paul Lawrie, and Brian Barnes, joining Marchbank.
But whatever happens they will not be automatically the poorer by
#500, the slow-play fine imposed on France's Christian Cevaer for 18
breaches of the permitted time limits in 11 holes. Leading two-round
aggregates (British and Irish unless stated):

JOHN Daly has failed to make the cut in the Classic in Perth,
Australia. The former US PGA champion improved four shots on his dismal
first-round 80, but his 36-hole total of 156 was nine strokes outside
the cut-off mark.
New Zealander David Smail fired a three-under-par 69 to open up a
two-stroke lead.

THE single company personal equity plan is still a relatively unknown
animal which gets lost in the stampede of publicity which surrounds the
general PEP, its better known relative.
The single company PEP facility grew out of the Government's desire to
provide a tax-free environment for employees who acquire shares under
employee share schemes. What is emerging is a range of cheap share
dealing services provided by companies for their small shareholders. It
is a development which anyone interested in no-frills share dealing
should know about.
The tax rules on PEPs allow you to invest up to #6000 a year through a
general PEP, and another #3000 through a single company PEP. Using the
PEP rules, a married couple can invest up to #18,000 a year tax free on
the stock market.
General PEPs come in a number of guises, from self-select to managed,
to those which pop your investment straight into a unit or investment
trust.
With a single market PEP, your #3000 allowance can only be invested in
one share each year. This may not be the best way of spreading
investment risk, but if you have already filled your boots with general
PEPs, or you wish to transfer an existing holding, this may not matter.
There are now more than 200 companies which sponsor their own single
company PEPs through a number of PEP providers. Most also offer a
general PEP facility because there is nothing in the rules to prevent
you putting your general PEP allowance into the shares of just one
company as well. Eight out of ten of the FT-30 index shares, nearly
three-quarters of the FTSE-100 shares and the vast majority of
privatisation shares now sponsor their own PEP schemes.
There is an argument going on in companies about the best way to
provide shareholders with in-house PEP and share dealing services. Some
have decided to expand their service to other company shares.
Others have decided to restrict dealing to their own shares but to
offer it almost free.
P&amp;O is of the second school of thought. It recently moved its PEP
scheme from the biggest PEP provider in the single company field,
Bradford &amp; Bingley, to its registrar, the Royal Bank of Scotland.
P&amp;O's assistant secretary, Michael Owen, says: ''We think our company
registrars are the best people to handle those shareholders who want to
hold their P&amp;0 shares through a PEP. It is simply another entry on the
share register and the only extra expense is reclaiming the tax credit
on the dividend. It allows us to offer a no-cost service. With our PEP
there is no minimum investment, no initial charge and no annual charge.
There is a dealing charge of 0.25% with no minimum, which is as cheap as
anything on the High Street.
''We haven't publicised the new scheme yet, but we will be sending out
a leaflet with the annual report in April.''
You can hold only P&amp;0's deferred stock this way as the rules of the
concessionary shares prevent them being held in a PEP.
Barclays Stockbrokers provides PEPs for a number of privatised
companies, most notably British Airways. Barclays took the additional
services route when it invented the privatisation PEP for BA in 1990.
This scheme gave its shareholders the right to hold other privatisation
stocks in their BA general PEP. They had to hold a certain number of BA
shares, but this was the only restriction.
Justin Urquhart Stewart, director of business planning at Barclays
Stockbrokers, explains how the idea has grown: ''Later we persuaded
British Airways to extend the idea to other shares. We now provide this
multi-stock facility to 16 companies, including Redland, BET, British
Aerospace, British Land, Iceland, South Wales Electricity and BAA.''

* IT IS just as well for Morton that they have a relatively
simple-looking home game against the second division's bottom dogs,
Brechin City. As well as having midfielder Alan Mahood suspended after
he was sent off in the midweek Scottish Cup replay against Kilmarnock,
the Greenock side could also be without striker Rowan Alexander, who is
trying to shake off an injury. Brechin include Gary Mearns, who has just
been signed from Forfar.
A second booking also meant an automatic ban today for East Fife's
Mark Donaghy. The Fifers are seeking a work permit for Arnold Dawika, a
striker from Trinidad who has been training with the club. The visitors
to Methil are Clyde, who welcome back Jim Thomson into central defence.
Paul Armstrong may return for Stirling Albion's visit to
Stenhousemuir, who now lead the division by five points and are unbeaten
this season at Ochilview.
They might hope to go further ahead as two of the closest pursuers
clash at Berwick, where Dumbarton are the visitors. The home side wait
for Paul Rutherford and Alan Banks while Dumbarton could have Colin
McKinnon back.
Meadowbank add Tommy Graham for the relegation encounter against Queen
of the South, for whom Andy McFarlane is doubtful.
Ross County's Chris Somerville is another red card casualty from the
cup and misses the vital third-division match at Montrose. Leaders
Forfar should be unchanged for the visit to Caley Thistle.
while Arbroath include new signing David Pew in the squad for the
visit to Alloa.
Queen's Park seem to be picking up a bit but have Kevin McGoldrick
doubtful for the home game against Cowdenbeath. The Fifers have six away
wins so far, are third in the division, and carry a permanent threat in
the form of 24 goal Mark Yardley.

<TEXT>
ENGLAND cricketer Devon Malcolm came crashing back to earth yesterday,
just four days after his head-in-the-clouds performance at the Adelaide
Oval.
The fast bowler who helped his country to a famous Test victory over
Australia earlier this week, was the main offender as Mike Atherton's
men let another chance of glory slip through their fingers.
Twice Malcolm could have denied Michael Slater his third century of
the Ashes series -- and twice he made a mess of catches that were almost
too easy to be true.
A simple return chance when Australia's young opener was on 59 somehow
escaped Malcolm's grasp. And so did a miscued hook to long leg 28 runs
later.
In fairness to Malcolm, neither embarrassing moment would have
occurred had he not been the first bowler to suffer on a day England
developed a damaging case of dropsy.
The fifth Test was just a couple of minutes old when Slater edged
Malcolm's fourth delivery into -- and then out of -- Graham Gooch's
hands as the former captain dived right at third slip.
That was not the kind of start Gooch, playing his last international
and winning a record 118th cap, wanted after being warmly applauded on
to the field.
But at least it was a reasonably difficult chance -- unlike the other
three to go down on a day in which Australia recovered from 55 for two
to reach 283 for four by close of play.
Mark Waugh, Slater's partner in a third wicket stand of 183, escaped
on 18 after snicking Chris Lewis to John Crawley in the gulley.
But nothing could compare with Malcolm's mistakes. The return catch
was travelling so gently that a footballer would have been able to trap
the ball on his chest.
And when Slater hooked Phillip DeFreitas to long leg, the chance
looked easier to hold than drop. Scoreboard:
AUSTRALIA -- First Innings
M J Slater c Lewis b DeFreitas124
M A Taylor c Rhodes b Lewis   9
D C Boon c Ramprakash b Lewis  1

* NEW Zealand's openers survived two short spells of West Indian pace
yesterday in a rain-affected start to the first Test in Christchurch.
West Indies won the toss and put the Kiwis in to bat and they
struggled to 24 for no wicket from 11.4 overs in just 47 minutes' play.

WHEN Dundee entertained Dunfermline at Dens Park at the beginning of
October around 5000 fans were treated to an eight-goal spectacle, with
the Fifers grabbing two late strikes to earn a point. A repeat today
must be doubtful. For a start, leaders Dundee have taken heed of manager
Jim Duffy's warning then that they had to tighten up in defence, having
lost 12 goals in three games.
Twenty games later, they have never lost more than two goals in 90
minutes, are still in the Scottish Cup, and have a healthy six-point
lead over second-placed Dunfermline, Raith Rovers, and Airdrie.
The last time Stranraer and Airdrie met was in what became known as
the Battle of Broadwood. Four Stranraer players were red-carded by
referee Andrew Waddell, three others were booked, and Airdrie's Paul
Jack was stretchered off in the match, which Airdrie won 8-1.
Raith Rovers are going for their seventh successive league victory
when they entertain Ayr United for the second week in a row. A repeat of
their 1-0 cup victory would satisfy the Fifers.
Clydebank are keen to follow up their fine midweek draw against Hearts
with a much-needed league victory over St Johnstone at Kilbowie.
Firhill pitch permitting, Hamilton Accies are looking for a
confidence-boosting result against St Mirren before facing Rangers on
Monday.

A FULL house is certain at Glasgow's Kelvin Hall next Saturday
following confirmation last night that Linford Christie will return from
Australia to run the 60 metres for Britain against France.
Two other world champions, Colin Jackson and Sally Gunnell, also will
be included when the team is announced on Monday, but Christie will
escape the examination he faced last year when Jackson ran him to
one-hundredth of a second. Jackson will confine himself to the hurdles.
Their presence promises a packed arena, unlike the sparse turn-out
against Russia in Birmingham, or the opening session of the AAA indoor
event there last night, when several Scots staked claims to UK places.
Grant Graham, of Clydesdale, just 22, became the first Scot to win the
1500m title since Ian Stewart 20 years ago. In a tactical race (2-12 at
800m) he reached the bell alongside Dundee's Ian Campbell, and beat him
by .07 with 3-55.68.
Graham, a member of Britain's Europa Cup under-23 team, may not have
run fast enough to book his place, for Campbell is Britain's quickest
this year, with a time more than 10 seconds faster.
City of Glasgow's Alison Grey, shot-putt runner-up last year, was
relegated to bronze (15.30m) as Judy Oakes took her thirteenth indoor
title and a UK veterans' record of 17.81m.
With the drug conviction of Paul Edwards, men's shot winner for the
past five years, there was a new winner -- Lee Newman (17.30m). Scottish
Commonwealth Games man Steve Whyte took second with 16.95.
Mel Neef and teenage Anglo Alison Curbishley cruised to the women's
400m final, while Brian Whittle did likewise in the men's. Other
title-winners:
Men. Long jump -- B Williams (Wolverhampton) 7.55m. Pole vault -- P
Williamson (Thames Valley) 5.20m. Women. Long jump -- D Lewis
(Birchfield) 6.28m. High jump -- L Haggett (Croydon) 1.86m.

WARNING: joint accounts can damage your wealth, not to mention your
wardrobe. This week's news story about an irate boyfriend putting his
girlfriend's favourite clothes on the bonfire when he discovered she had
taken #80 from their joint bank account to buy a jacket is perhaps the
clearest warning yet that sharing your account can be dangerous.
Events like this are, thankfully, few and far between, but there is a
much more serious problem connected with joint accounts which is
threatening to leave millions of loyal savers out of pocket.
While the Government may be belatedly moving to correct a quirk in
building society law, its actions could come too late to help some
Scottish savers with the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society.
Many of these savers are widows and stand to miss out on their share
of the #1800m cash payout -- an average payment of #2000 each -- due to
be made to savers when the C&amp;G is taken over by Lloyds Bank.
The problem has been caused by an anomaly in the 1986 Building
Societies Act. This was highlighted last summer when the High Court
ruled that payments could only be made to savers who had held a share
account with C&amp;G as the sole or first-named joint account holder
continuously since December 31, 1992. The ruling also barred C&amp;G from
making payments to borrowers.
The judgement meant that some very long-standing C&amp;G savers would not
qualify for a windfall payment because their membership of the society
had, for whatever reason, been broken since the end of 1992.
They could include savers who had closed one type of C&amp;G share
account, only to open another with the society later, for instance.
However, the harshest effect of the ruling concerns joint account
holders, many of whom are widows and widowers. They won't qualify for a
cash payment simply because the first name on their joint account --
usually the husband's -- has been removed since the end of 1992
following death.
Only the first named person on a joint account counts as a member of a
building society. And, as the conventional way of referring to a married
couple is ''Mr and Mrs', it is the husband who normally appears first.
''We have a huge amount of sympathy for these savers,'' says a C&amp;G
spokesperson.
''Before last summer's ruling both this group of savers and borrowers
would have qualified for a cash payment, but we have had to abide by the
law.
''We have had letters from MPs on behalf of their constituents about
the problem, but we have told them that it really is up to MPs to get
the law changed.''
Until recently the Government planned to deal with this issue as part
of a general review of building society regulations now taking place.
The conclusions of that review have not yet been announced, and it
might have been 1997 before new legislation was enacted. That would have
meant the same problem could have affected a much bigger number of
savers with the Halifax and Leeds Permanent. These societies are
planning to merge before converting to a public limited company.
The prospect of millions of widows losing out simply because of an
anomaly in building society legislation has clearly concentrated minds
at the Treasury. It is now recommending Government support for a change
in the law.
C&amp;G is delighted that such a change may be imminent, but it says that
new legislation must be in force by August 1 if widows and other savers
are to benefit. If all goes according to plan, that is the day C&amp;G is
due to become part of Lloyds Bank.
''We have secured Lloyds Bank's agreement to provide additional money
to enable these savers to be paid separately at a cost of over #10m if
the August 1 deadline is met,'' the spokesperson says.
The Government will have to get its skates on if it is to have new
legislation in place by then.
Joint accounts are a useful way for couples to achieve higher rates of
return by pooling their resources to create a bigger savings balance
and, therefore, qualify for higher interest.
They are also the traditional way for young couples to save towards
their first mortgage.
Since the introduction of independent taxation in the 1990/91 tax
year, though, there can be complications for married couples.
Husbands and wives with joint accounts are treated as receiving half
the interest each and are taxed accordingly. If they own the investments
in unequal shares, they must tell the taxman so that they pay tax only
on the interest due to each of them.
Joint account holders need to watch out too if their tax rates are
different, particularly if the account covers a family of four, or
several brothers and sisters, for instance.
Non-taxpayers can register to have their interest paid without any
deduction for tax. But some society and bank computer systems cannot
arrange for a non-taxpaying joint account holder to receive his or her
share of the interest gross if the other holders are taxpayers.
If this is the case with your account, you'll need to claim the
overpayment of tax back from the Inland Revenue.

THOSE diligent students of the investment trust movement at NatWest
Securities have been thumbing through last year's huge pile of paper,
thumping the calculator buttons and coming up with the conclusion that
the inflow of new money into the sector during the year caused it to
expand by more than 20%.
The figure which flashed up for the year's total was an
''astonishing'' net inflow of #8024m. That, they note, compares with
total year-end assets for the sector, including split and quasi split
capital trusts of around #43.6bn. Even if you strip out the bringing to
market of 3i and the huge, but so far disappointing, European
privatisation launches of Mercury and Kleinwort, the net inflow is still
#3373m, almost twice the comparable figure for 1993.
Most of the money came via new issues which varied considerably in
size. Seven drew in more than #100m and nine less than #25m. But overall
the figures indicated that #25m to #50m remains the norm for a new
trust.
Rights and 'C' share issues raised #913m. The 'C' shares have, the
analysts comment, solved a real problem for the sector by creating a
continuing opportunity for popular and successful trusts to add to their
size without adversely affecting the interests of existing shareholders.
But, aside from adding to the management fees, what is the effect of
'C' share issues? Short term, one suspects it is to reduce the premium
which tempted the managers to make the issue. NatWest Securities is now
planning a study of the present possibilities for 'C' shares and their
long-term effects. This will come after numbers have been crunched on
long-term effects of the exercise of warrants and a report on this
published. Both 'C' shares and warrants, the team feels, may have a
greater effect on ratings than might be suspected at a superficial
glance.
Hamish Buchan and his colleagues at NatWest are not handing out
congratulations all round. They complain that the industry last year
largely failed to take advantage of its ability to borrow. They take the
managers to task with the comment: ''A vexatious feature of 1994 was the
way the sector seemed to miss the boat as regards the raising of new
debentures at low interest rates.''
They add: ''Now that interest rates are rising concerned shareholders
should be asking questions of their boards.''
One type of activity which has all but disappeared is the takeover
bid. In the past some of these were clearly inspired by the tempting
prospect of buying a bargain. Nowadays, as the NatWest analysts point
out: ''There is no incentive to make bids when discounts are low.''
But they add that more often that not the bids of yesteryear were
mounted in order to get money into the market quickly and efficiently,
while ''of late it has proved much easier simply to subscribe new equity
capital to the sector instead''.
Is this the shape of things to come? Mr Buchan cautions against
extrapolating a trend into the indefinite future. Some day, he suggests,
the industry may move from its phase of expansion and proliferation into
a phase of rationalisation. Such phrases as ''financial Darwinism'' and
''constructive cannibalism'', which he coined to describe what was going
on back in the early and middle eighties, may sound archaic now. Yet he
says: ''Their time may come again, although when is impossible to
tell.''
Mr Buchan highlights a number of changes which have altered the
conventional view of trusts. As we have already noted here, one point
traditionally made in favour of investment trusts -- that they could
gear up -- was passed by with an ''indifferent yawn'' when the
opportunity presented itself. Another is that investment trust
management fees are ''now no better than competitive, at least as far as
new issues are concerned.''
Looking at last year's new issues, he concludes: ''The going rate for
annual management fees is now 1% or upwards, knocking on 1.25%.'' And
nine had a fee base higher than 1.25%.
''Investment trust have the edge over many other types of collective
investment vehicle in terms of cost. But investors must recognise the
changing realities. With some gallant exceptions, the days when the
going rate for a typical trust was between 0.25% and 0.40% are long
past.''
The expansion of the investment trust industry, as readers of these
pages will already have noted, has given it a much more exotic
appearance. They have been specialising in quite closely defined areas
with a variety of risks which are sometimes pretty acute. These new type
trusts have grown up around the more traditional ''generalists'', such
as Foreign and Colonial and Alliance, which roamed the world cherry
picking.
It worries Mr Buchan a bit. He has ''a nagging doubt as to the effect
on the less experienced private investor of the industry's successful
publicity in recent years''.
He asks: ''Will such investors be tempted to regard, say, Alliance and
First Russian Frontiers as genuine alternatives? Some new investors may
have failed to grasp the astonishing range of risk and reward
opportunities the sector now offers.''
Around #1000m of last year's new money went into emerging markets,
which Mr Buchan repeats are not his cup of tea.
At home, #405m of new money was raised for UK funds, a good deal for
income growth but some for capital growth. Here, he notes, managers are
tapping into what used to be seen as the unit trust market.
Not all investors will be feeling happy about their investment trust
purchases last year. But if they want to compare how their trust is
doing against rivals in its area, NatWest Securities has created a new
set of price indices which are more numerous and specialised than the
FTSE sub-sector categories.

US Tour in Arizona three weeks ago, disappeared entirely as he compiled
a disappointing 72 at Pebble Beach in the second round of the AT &amp; T
National Pro-Am in 80[DEG]F sunshine yesterday.
After his 66 on Thursday, Faldo's even card of 72 on the 6799-yard
links left him on a 36-hole total of 138, four shots behind early leader
Brad Faxon, who scored a brilliant 64 at Poppy Hills.
He started well enough, twice chipping dead at the two long holes for
birdies, but he dropped shots at the 464-yard ninth and 384-yard
eleventh.
He later went out to practise at Spyglass Hill, where he plays his
third round today. Second-round scores included:
134 -- B Faxon 70, 64.
135 -- T Watson 70, 65; G Boros 69, 66; F Zoeller 68, 67.
136 -- D Love 65, 71; K Perry 68, 68.
138 -- N Faldo (Britain) 66, 72; J Adams 72, 66; J Furyk 70, 68; P
Stewart 71, 67.
139 -- M Brooks 70, 69; M Heinen 72, 67; E Humenik 70, 69; J Maggert
71, 68; R Mediate 70, 69.
140 -- F Funk 69, 71; S Haskins 71, 69.
141 -- B Andrade 71, 70; W Austin 72, 69; J Nicklaus 71, 70.
142 -- C Dennis 73, 69.
143 -- P Goydos 71, 72.
144 -- P Azinger 74, 70; R Freeman 72, 72; S Elkington (Australia) 74,
70; V Singh (Fiji) 72, 72.
145 -- D Hart 75, 70; J Parnevik (Sweden) 74, 71.
147 -- A Palmer 77, 70.

Bringing down the curtain on the dream world of cinema, Alison Kerr
talks to director Whit Stillman.
WHIT Stillman is the writer-director-producer of Metropolitan, the New
York-set, Oscar-nominated comedy of manners that -- with its low budget
and talky, literate script -- was the unexpected hit of 1990. His new
film, Barcelona, is (unusually for a second film) a worthy successor,
and opened yesterday at Edinburgh's Cameo cinema. The witty Stillman's
only problem with selecting his Fantasy Filmhouse fodder was that, being
a lifelong buff, he was spoilt for choice.
''Both my films have their Fantasy Filmhouse elements. Metropolitan
was partly provoked by one film critic's sweeping assertion that the
world depicted in the 1930s Astaire-Rogers movies had entirely vanished.
For me, Metropolitan -- about a group of Manhattan youths in formal
clothes (they've been to the Christmas dances) who stay up all night
talking and trying to find someone on whom to have a crush -- is a cross
between the Astaire-Rogers Top Hat and Bill Forsyth's comedy of
Glaswegian youth with time on their hands, That Sinking Feeling.
''I see Barcelona as the Beau Geste of the Sexual Revolution, with the
Saharan Muslim hordes being replaced by attractive, progressive young
Spanish women from the wild post-Franco days, who emerge victorious. At
the end, the fort is overtaken. Instead of a Viking funeral, there is a
ceremonial immolation of hamburgers.
''What I propose for Fantasy Filmhouse is that we consider not just
the entertainment value of films, but also their therapeutic role. Films
are far less expensive than the services of psychotherapists; can be
shared with friends and should be a lot more fun.
''During the guilty crises of adolescence, there was nothing like
Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train for that catharsis feeling. Two other
favourite films with wildly different release mechanisms for crime and
guilt are the brilliantly deadpan Kind Hearts and Coronets and Mario
Monicelli's wonderfully ridiculous Persons Unknown (I Soliti Ignoti).
''For my fantasy film, the set-up would be: Ginger Rogers is dead.
Fred Astaire has long been suspected of detesting her, and she had
recently caught him singing Gershwin ballads to Margaret Sullavan, much
more convincingly. He must perform another amazing dance sequence (with
no cuts) to prove his innocence and unmask the murderer -- Eric Blore.
''The veteran character actor had been blackmailing Rogers over her
continuing, sordid, relationship with impresario Adolphe Menjou. Even
comic actors in impossibly frothy musicals have their needs. The onus of
guilt is removed from Astaire. He and Sullavan marry and board a Buenos
Aires-bound liner where an insanely happy production dance number takes
place.
''Based on a concept by Patricia Highsmith, with additional story
elements by Max Beerbohm. Screenplay by S N Behrman, Charles Brackett,
and Noel Coward. Direction by Hitchcock and Mark Sandrich. A Pandro S
Berman production.''

ONE OF Scotland's off-board successes in the recent Moscow Olympiad
was Alex McFarlane's successful qualification for the title of
international arbiter. The busy Glasgow organiser wasted no time in
organising his first internationally-rated tournament following his
award. Soon after Moscow, he brought together ten Scottish players in
the Paisley YMCA 150th Anniversary New Year FIDE-rated event.
The tournament will not win a prize for the zippiest name in the
international calendar. It is, however, a welcome event. Designed to
offer Scottish players the opportunity to play for an international
rating, it achieved its purpose for five previously unrated players.
Glasgow school teacher Philip Giulian, the highest-rated player in the
field, shared first place with Andrew Burnett on 7/9. Santosh Umesh
finished third on 5[1/2] points.
Paisley YMCA, who hosted the New Year tournament, have fielded one of
the strongest club teams in Scotland for many years and last year won
the UK National Club Championship. John Shaw, one of their top players,
features in this week's game, which he played in the Moscow Olympiad.
This was a rather special victory, his first win for Scotland, after an
anxious start to his career in the Scottish team at the European Team
Championship, in Debrecen, a year ago.

Small companies who combine to form a group are becoming more common.
Doreen Taylor-Wilkie looks at one which offers every activity and sport
imaginable.
BIGGER is certainly not necessarily better in the travel business
particularly when the ''littles'' get together to pool their resources.
It is happening a lot -- think of the number of small independent hotels
who have formed groups -- and no area has been more successful in this
sort of association than the small tour operators.
AITO (the Association of Independent Tour Operators) is a good
example. From a handful in the late 1970s, it has grown to more than
150. AITO's first aim (after the sudden collapse of a big company at
that time) was to achieve a fully comprehensive scheme of ''bonding''
for small operators, to ensure that their clients' money was safe no
matter what went wrong, and a wish to share mutual interests and
concerns.
From that grew today's AITO, eager to show off its wares at a recent
London meeting. Sixty-plus members took part, with holidays to some 200
countries and regions, from Alaska to Zimbabwe, many of them
individualistic, sometimes evolved from the founders' own interests.
There is every activity and sport imaginable -- paddling the Amazon,
bungee-jumping, dolphin watching, wine touring, elephant trekking, green
holidays, as well as simply sightseeing, golf, or skiing. Many tours are
tailor-made for anyone who asks -- from a #99 overnight to a Himalayan
climbing expedition costing thousands. ''Whatever the price, we all
pride ourselves on good, well-informed staff,'' said AITO's chief
executive, Sue Ockwell, ''and a lot of care and personal attention''.
Holts Battlefield Tours, one of the first to specialise in military
history, are liable to be even busier this year, with four
50th-anniversary tours to commemorate the end of the Second World War.
At the same time, regular tours continue with titles such as Marlborough
in Flanders, Gettysburg and the Eastern Campaign, The Re-occupation of
Singapore, and always, The Great War, 80 years on, all led by experts.
Christopher Kirker is current chairman of AITO, and Kirker Holidays
concentrate on Europe but in a different way. The company are city and
hotel specialists, with a honed knowledge of a vast number of European
hotels, where they send clients for short breaks. This is not a ''book
the plane/book the hotel and leave them to it affair''. It is a highly
personal service -- no airport bus for these busy travellers. They are
met by a company member, plus a taxi, or special small luxury minibus.
Much more energetic is the Alternative Travel Group, walking to the
most beautiful places the company can find, in small compatible groups,
or cycling on individually chosen tours. Though the purists may cry
''chicken'', one of the best things is that both for walkers and
cyclists the company carries the luggage, a vast relief on a steep
slope. Walking can be even more restful. Each group has two staff and a
Mercedes minibus with it. Though routes are continuous, you need not
walk any more than you feel like. Much tougher is Exodus Travels, with
its Overland programme, featuring Africa, Asia, and South America for
''more adventurous travellers''.
Martin Randall trained as an art historian, studying in both Italy and
Germany, and around the beginning of the 1980s he was lecturing on art
history, and taking a few groups abroad each year. Some 12 years later,
Martin Randall Travel offers a glorious mixture of knowledgeably led
art, archaeology, and music tours, including a musical cruise on the
Danube.
Another company, personally led by its owners, Brian Williams and
Chris Parrott, is Journey Latin America. ''A lot of our time is spent
using our specialist knowledge to get the best possible flights arranged
for people travelling to South America,'' said Chris Parrott, a graduate
in Spanish and Latin American studies, who earlier lived and taught in
Brazil. There is also a fine programme of bespoke itineraries for
individuals, and groups escorted by leaders who speak the language and
know the territory. The routes are glorious -- 13,000ft up in the Andes
on a bus, the Amazon rain forest, wildlife and Inca ruins, and many more
permutations.
AITO companies either sell direct or, more recently, some sell through
specially selected travel agents.

* THIS year is the National Trust's centenary, marked by an issue of
special stamps, an offical history, and a beautiful pinky red rose named
after Octavia Hill, one of the founders. Everywhere, NT properties will
be bustling with special events -- centenary tours, lectures, music,
craft fairs, drama by the Young National Trust Theatre, painting
exhibitions, and outdoor jollities ending in fireworks.
Renting a National Trust cottage has long been popular, and the newer
National Trust Travel Collection, with Page &amp; Moy, includes centenary
tours of NT properties, and centenary tours overseas. The National Trust
for Scotland has over 30 years to go for its hundred, but the present
centenary includes Northern Ireland which, in the Giant's Causeway and
Mount Stewart, has what many claim as Britain's most magnificent natural
feature, and the loveliest garden. Other easy journeys from Southern
Scotland are to Cumbria which has 13 properties, and Northumberland
eight, including Lindisfarne.

* THE swinging new ScotRail is going in for short-break holidays --
easy-going or active -- with the aim of bringing more leisure traffic to
the West Highland Line, which has just celebrated its centenary year.
Short breaks are to Oban and Fort William, from #79. Ski breaks to Fort
William include lift passes on the Nevis range for practised skiers from
#118, and there is an inclusive Beginners' Break, for ski-illiterates
(or should it be ''skilliterates?'') like me. It includes hire of skis,
boots, and poles, group tuition, and two days' lift passes. Prices start
at #144 for adults and #70 for children.
Details: 0800 995577.
* EVERY year, holiday travellers get more and more ambitious, almost a
competition as to who can go furthest. But in the rush they may overlook
very necessary immunisations, from anti-malaria pills to cholera and
yellow-fever jags. Advice is just as vital -- whether to carry a
sterilised ''essentials'' pack, mosquito nets, water filters, and the
like. In this last-minute scramble, you may not know that British
Airways has 36 Travel Clinics around Britain, as well as a main clinic
at Heathrow. These designated BA Travel Clinics, usually within a
hospital, university, or large surgery, provide a combined service of
immunisations, tailor-made for a particular journey, and advice. With
everything under one roof it can save time.
The Department of Health also issues a good booklet, Health Advice for
Travellers, for Europe. This has health precautions and also details of
reciprocal arrangements, essential forms, etc.

* WELCOME Homes is a unique organisation based in Edinburgh which, for
the past 12 years, has been matching guests to carefully chosen host
families, for high-quality bed-and-breakfast accommodation, all within
easy reach of Edinburgh's centre. Starting in a modest way, to cater for
the vast influx of people to the capital during the Edinburgh Festival,
the organisation has grown in scope and size. It is run by Wendy and
Barrie Mackay and now offers a range of ideas from Edinburgh Festival
and Tattoo packages to Homestead Golfing holidays, with some 40 courses
to choose from including Dunbar, Gullane, and North Berwick. For 1995,
Welcome Homes is offering a three-night hospitality package, from July
16-19, for the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race which starts from Leith.
The idea behind Welcome Homes is in the title, to make guests feel
they are being welcomed into a family. Some hosts offer a traditional
Scottish afternoon-tea service with all the trimmings. Welcome Homes is
also good for study, cultural, and youth groups, choirs and orchestras,
and the Mackays make sure that all group members, if they want to, are
accommodated with neighbouring hosts in the same district.

Two wise young men from the Middle East visit Papa Westray. Jim
Hewitson finds them eager to learn.
IT WOULD be easy, too easy really, out here on the rugged,
wind-blasted edge of creation to imagine that mankind's troubles are as
insubstantial and transient as the vast gossamer spiders' web on the
Well Park or the rainbows arcing into the Atlantic swell.
Chechnya, Rwanda, Bosnia, the problems of the inner cities, famine,
and disaster can be as real -- or otherworldly -- as we wish. Put down
the newspaper, switch off the radio, and the gulls wheel as ever above
the surf at Surhoose Taing and that loose slate in the north roof
rattles still.
Change there is on Papa Westray, I suppose, but it is almost
imperceptible and as nothing set against the hurly-burly that is the lot
of most of the world today.
Strange then that it should take something as mundane as an overstruck
penalty kick to put us back in touch with the wider realities, at least
for a wee while.
Over at the playing field my teenage son David and I were down to the
traditional conclusion to our daily midwinter kickabout -- the penalty
shoot-out. My last effort cleared the crossbar, the ball bounced a
couple of times on the sodden grass opposite the kirk, rolled on to the
road and came to rest at the feet of two lads who had been wandering
down from the shop.
With their coats zipped up to the neck and tammies pulled down around
their ears they had that shivery, slightly shell-shocked, but
unmistakable look of out-of-season tourists suddenly finding themselves
deposited for a few hours at the last halt before the Arctic.
Picking up the ball they came to the fence. ''Can we play also?'' they
asked earnestly. Their request was heartfelt, prompted as much by the
threat of hypothermia as by the love of sport, I suspect. In any case,
team games are at a premium with our tiny population and even a
two-a-side match is to be cherished. Play commenced.
The boys, Shimon and Dave -- both in their late teens -- had come a
distance for this bounce game on the playing fields of Papa Westray --
christened the Clover Bowl by my kids. They'd come, in fact, from a
little village 20 minutes from Jerusalem and were touring Britain. They
were quick to point out, however, that from here the only way was south,
back to the sunshine.
It was soon clear that our David's youthful enthusiasm and my
undoubted ball skills would not be enough against the power play of
these fit young men. They had another trick -- speech play. Each attack
was peppered with politely phrased questions: ''This place is very
different. Where are all your trees? Does the wind always blow so hard?
Where are all the people? Does the sun ever shine?''
Gasping for breath and launching myself into the tackles I tried to
respond to this flow of queries. When the fourth Israeli goal sneaked in
between the orange fishing floats which served as goalposts we decided
to call it a day. There was rain in the air and a dinner invitation
seemed appropriate. It was cheerfully accepted.
Seated in the kitchen, we enjoyed the warm glow from the stove as the
soup bubbled in the pot and someone threw buckets of water at the
windae. We swapped notes about our lives in our two very different
communities. The boys tucked into their vegetable soup and rolls, their
easy, relaxed, and interested manner (and word-perfect English) allowing
the conversation to flow, even if some of the questions were starkly to
the point.
''Do you have much anti-Semitism in Scotland?'' I told Shimon I
thought not but we did have religious and racial tensions. We spoke of
the large Jewish community in Glasgow and this led us to Northern
Ireland and the Middle East. In both these areas we agreed that this new
year held the best chance for peace in the past two decades.
The rain was easing and a watery sun slanted across the kitchen table.
''We will join the Army next month,'' announced Dave, in a
matter-of-fact way between spoonfuls. Three years' military service is
compulsory for all young Israelis.
Did Shimon think a final, lasting peace could be achieved during his
period of service? ''I do not know, but what a wonderful thing it would
be to tell my grandchildren that during my Army service peace became
real.''
Quietly, deliberately they spoke about the death of a 19-year-old
soldier kidnapped by Arab militants, killed only a few miles from where
they live, of bus bombings and the constant risks for military
personnel.
''Everyone must complete their period of service. If you have skills
at languages you might be attached to the intelligence service, if you
know a bit about engines you might be a driver/mechanic. You go where
you are posted. We cannot think on what might happen, although our
parents will worry.''
All too soon they were on their way. ''We must see the seals before we
leave,'' they told us. Throwing their packs on their backs they headed
down the track followed by our squad of inquisitive cats.
Yes, we're fortunate, privileged as a family, to have found a billet
in a world apart, but it's important that we never forget that many
folk, both at home and abroad, are still living in the front line.

TEAM New Zealand's victory in the America's Cup challenger trials was
overturned and the two points awarded to John Bertrand's One Australia
when a protest by the Australians was upheld by the race jury yesterday.
It was ruled that Team New Zealand had broken a rule by frequently
placing crew member Murray Jones up the mast, approximately 30 metres
above the water, during the race. The rules restrict the length of time
allowed in that position and the reasons for being up there.
Revised challenger standings: 1, Team New Zealand 10pts; 2, One
Australia 9pts; 3, Tag Heuer Challenge 7pts; 4, Nippon Challenge 6pts;
5, Sydney 95 4pts; 6, France 2 3pts; 7, Rioja de Espana 0pts.

LATE January on the Bass Rock and already the first gannets are coming
home. On the remote Faroese island of Mykines, on January 25, the feast
of St Paul, young girls of the village used to climb to a high western
ridge overlooking the breeding cliffs of the gannets. There they would
wave their white aprons in imitation -- and invocation -- of the
gannets' white returning wings. Why? Well, it is only two centuries
since slated Bass Rock ''gugas'' were popular in the food markets of
Edinburgh.
While every other species of bird is migrating, courting, and
reproducing, the gannets will be working their way through their
breeding season. It is so protracted because of the bird's size -- 6ft
from wingtip to black wingtip; because of the abundant food in Scottish
waters -- as yet, it seems overfishing and environmental change have not
made the ''solan geese'' go hungry; but above all because of the
complexity of the gannet's social arrangements. Dr Bryan Nelson, their
biographer, has documented an extraordinary range of body language. Yet
it is all quite unvarying, for no bird can be said to ''think'' in a
human sense.
Few birds have such an imposing physical presence. On the Bass you can
get a mackerel's view of eyes like blue drills and a beak like a
polished dirk. Over half of the world's Atlantic gannets breed in
Scotland and they are with us for 10 months in the year. In May we will
see them shining off all our coasts as they wheel to dive on the silver
darlings. In September we will see the laden skeins of adults gliding
through the gales. Not till late October will the last of the big brown
young have paraplaned off the ledges and started the long swim south.

Harris -- mountains, fiords, the villages with bright houses. John
Macleod describes the contrasts of an island which smiles defiance in
the face of Providence.
I am currently away from home; away from Harris, and away from the
Long Island of which it is part. And so, for the moment, I am in exile.
There are good reasons for spending the winter in the city, and the city
has its own real advantages. For all that, I am rather homesick.
When I moved to Harris, early in 1993, it was because I liked the
place and the people; it had many of the virtues of Lewis -- my
ancestral home -- and some virtues of its own. Being of the same
landmass, it was handy for relatives in Stornoway and elsewhere. Yet the
mountain border, the high pass through the Clisham, also kept certain
things at a comfortable distance.
I also moved to Harris as part of a deliberate experiment. I wanted to
prove that one could maintain relevant journalism from beyond the
central belt -- away from glitzy city life, bright bars, colourful
cultural venues, other journalists. I would shift things to a new centre
of gravity. Though geographically peripheral, the Highlands and Islands
are very important to Scotland. From them we have adopted key elements
in our national identity, like bagpipes and tartan.
They said it couldn't be done; I was adamant it could be. I was also,
perhaps, out to settle a point with old foes of the Gaelic mafia. It had
always amused me how, being endowed with the Magic Tongue, they were
keen to play Highland spokespeople from the safe bounds of Glasgow's
West End sherry-circuit. My own Gaelic is minimal, and I do not claim to
be a spokesman for anybody, but I was eager to continue my commentary on
modern mores from a more appropriate environment.
DESPITE appearances, I am really a pseudo-Hebridean; I look like an
islander, but I am not one. My bloodline is pure Gael, and for various
complicated reasons I have always had a marked island accent, but until
I moved to Harris, I had never lived on an island in my life. And, for
22 of my 26 years, with one brief interlude in Inverness, I had spent my
life in Glasgow or Edinburgh.
The island, however, was the one constant in our childhood as my
parents moved from manse to manse. My brothers and I had an upbringing
remarkable for its cultural richness. We were raised in the bosom of a
vast extended family. We were intensely aware of kinship, of ties of
blood, of belonging. In an urban church, we grew up among the saints of
Glasgow Gaeldom, so many now gone to the glory for which they yearned.
The people of Harris, on various visits, duly won a special place in
my heart. At many levels it is a very sad island. For decades it has
been wasted by remorseless, steady depopulation. Linked by land to
Lewis, it has lost out on many of the facilities, much of the
infrastructure, it might otherwise have won.
You might think Harris very depressing. Well, there is that side --
and more of this anon -- but, in fact, it is an island of remarkable
vibrancy. A busy community smiles defiance in the face of Providence.
There are night-classes in winter, and exuberant football played in
summer, and an annual arts festival of increasing note. Hugely popular
with tourists, Harris bustles in the summer. It has received just the
right number of English and Lowland migrants; small enough not to
overwhelm, large enough to enrich.
North Harris is the more fragile half; the most elderly, its people
the most scattered, and perhaps a little defeatist. Yet its magnificent
mountains, its stabbing sea-lochs, make an important contribution to the
scenery. The South Harris environment is one of extremes -- the rock of
the east coast, the grandiloquent beaches of the west; the one dotted
with scrappy vegetation and fringed by seaweed, the other skirted by
machair and golden sands, caressed by the foaming Atlantic. South Harris
has a certain vigour. There are more children, and more young people.
Here, too, there is a religious distinction. The Church of Scotland
dominates the north of Harris, and the Free Presbyterian Church the
south.
The people of Harris are so nice they defy superlatives. The old --
especially the very old -- are gracious to a fault; each lady the
epitome of everyone's granny, each man the archetypal Highland
aristocrat. The young folk are relaxed and friendly, children exuberant
with interest in you. Nowhere in Harris, apart perhaps from Tarbert,
would you dream of locking your door when going out for the day; even in
Tarbert, few bother to lock up at night.
'Tis heresy, but the Harris folk are more likeable -- in some respects
-- than those of Lewis. They are far less aggressive, whatever their
walk of life; anyone familiar with the Gaelic media will immediately
shudder agreement when I mention a certain type of Lewiswoman on the
make. They are much more respectful; we in Lewis are incorrigible
mockers and Michael-extractors. Nor do the folk of Harris bear grudges.
When they are offended -- and to offend a Harrisman is remarkably hard
work -- there might be a time of austerity, a sharp word or two; and
then it is forgotten. In my mother's Lewis village, feuds are still
comfortably rolling begun by great-grandparents.
The Lewis aggressiveness, the legendary drive of the Lewisman, has
enriched that island and brought much by way of material goodies. At
some levels Harris has fallen behind. It was much more savagely
''cleared'' than Lewis in the last century. It has subsequently failed
to establish a good mercantile economy; Harris has the best crustacean
fishery in the Western Isles, and is of course the home of Harris Tweed,
but the great bulk of the profits go to Stornoway.
Lewis has cornered a disproportionate share of the island's retail and
service economies. Harris, meantime, still makes do with down-at-heel
schools, bad roads (though they are improving every year), and an
uncomfortable feeling of periphery. You could say, I suppose, that the
people of Harris are too nice for their own good.
But they are good people. And there is that wonderful environment;
mountains, fiords, the shining strands, the little villages with bright
houses, the still peace of a night in Tarbert, the cosy familiarity of
Scalpay, winter stars bright in a velvet sky. And so I came to live in
Harris.
TO UNDERSTAND an island, you have to live in it. I have been in Harris
for almost two years. I am beginning to understand it. I have passed the
stage of liking it. I now love Harris, with a passion sometimes sore in
its intensity, but I am aware too of its faults, of the strains in
living here.
Love for a place is not blind. Love is founded on real knowledge: the
good with the bad, the hard with the warm. There is an old, old cemetery
behind my house, and at the little summit is a knoll, the buried ruins
(perhaps) of an ancient chapel dedicated to Moluag.
Sometimes, at night -- the thin blue darkness of midsummer, the clear
moonlit frost of winter -- I have climbed up to this spot, and looked
about the township. If Moluag was ever here, perhaps he did the same.
Perhaps he too scanned this loch, that shore, and felt his heart full;
love mingled with wonder, pride with pain.
There is peace in the township, but also -- sometimes -- an acute
sense of isolation. The hills are grand, but scarred with the ridges of
long-abandoned cultivation; ground worked by people long gone and of
another township, across the loch, which has all but ceased to exist.
This night is still and calm, but other nights are not.
The weather. Have you the least comprehension of a Hebridean winter?
From October the days shoot in, shorter and shorter, the light ebbing
and the sun falling, until by Christmas it is never really light and the
night is total and oppressive. The gales come, and they can lift heavy
tools and burst windows and demolish roofs and rock your car and coat it
-- from even a long distance -- with salt from the sea.
I have known a night when I think I nearly died trying to trundle a
dustbin to the road, with the wind roaring demonically and with all the
ice of Siberia behind it, freezing my ears and ripping at my coat and
blasting snow into every cranny. And I have sat, alone, that same night
too terrified to go to bed, with the house shaking and banging and
quailing before the onslaught of the wind; sleep was quite impossible.
My neighbours, ever cheerful, assure me that I have yet to experience
a real gale in the township.
Then there is rain. North Harris has the heaviest rainfall in the
Outer Hebrides. It makes any outdoor work highly unpleasant, if not
impossible. Heavy rain makes you fret for exercise. Heavy rain, in
spring, makes you long for summer; summer rain gives a profound sense of
betrayal.
Summer -- May and June especially -- goes a long way to compensating
for winter; in May you can be sure of some weeks of fine sunny weather.
August is oppressive in another way. It is characterised by a horrid
stickiness, and August nights are haunted by midges, and in August
decomposition and decay are all about you.
So there is that in your ambiguous love: the besieging climate. Which
brings the pressure of winter driving. Unfortunately our township is
very small, without shops or facilities, and I now have no
contemporaries in the village. So the car, for shopping or errands or
any kind of social life, is essential. And -- in a season of high wind,
poor light, black ice, drifting snow, loose hail, flooding roads -- most
hazardous. It can be exciting. It is always potentially dangerous. In
the long run it is exhausting.
There is a strain, too, in living alone. One must not be mawkish. But
to live alone when you are self-employed and in a remote, tiny Highland
village requires a measure of vigilance. Too readily you can let
standards slide -- eat out of tins, wash infrequently, forget to shave.
Drink has to be watched -- and the bottle, even for the most virtuous of
us, can have an appalling pull on a long dark evening. We need other
people, of course, and so you must construct a good and healthy social
network. In an island culture, however, this can be acutely difficult.
For one thing, bachelors have a curious status in the island: you are
deemed quite incapable of giving hospitality. So no-one visits you.
(Only one of my neighbours has ever come to a ceilidh with me, a lad
younger than myself, and he is now a student in Glasgow.) This means you
must visit them. You then encounter the intricate social dance of
Hebridean culture.
In all rural communities, gossip is a major part of life. Social
intercourse, therefore, consists of maximising information on all about
you and minimising the goods they have on you. Further, the islands are
a maddeningly indirect culture; people are loath to state definite
opinions, or take a strong line on anything, or settle some difference
straightforwardly. Further still, it is a world where friendship means
something quite different from the city.
In an urban context, we all have special friends -- people we know
intimately, people who will drop everything to come to our aid. In a
little village, where you know everybody and have known them all your
life, this would be far too intense. The game, rather, is to get along
with everyone and avoid any undue obligation or intimacy. The Hebridean,
gracious and friendly as he is, has his own subtle ways of keeping you
at a distance.
A certain paranoia therefore attends all socialising. Do these people
really like you? Do they really want you? Are you quite sure you are
welcome? Have you just, somehow, caused offence? There can, sometimes,
be no way of telling. Or things are conveyed in code, in little symbols
and acts of profound significance: but the mandatory indirectness of
this will try your genius.
Of all social faults, the worst in the islands is that of drawing
attention to yourself. Which, if you are writing a column in a national
newspaper, makes life rather difficult.
There are two other things I find trying. One, surprisingly, is the
church culture. Here I am not making any denominational point; the
Presbyterian churches of the island are all, in life and outlook, very
similar, varying only in certain matters of practice. But the church in
Harris may now be running on empty, living on the momentum of long-gone
revivals and a former passion. There is much empty tradition. There is a
remarkable lack of what I might call vital Christianity -- that living
religion which is first-hand, thought through, and lived out,
consciously Biblical, caring for people.
For a few active churchmen, their role is not one of encouragement and
care, but of meddling in other people's lives, of ''telling the manse'',
of stifling all impulse towards reformation and change. But a church
that is not continuously reformed will die. And for too many people of
my generation, the Hebridean church is something associated with guilt
and with profound social division. In much of my own experience, the
church inflicts very great pain.
There is a negativity, too, beyond the church. People in the Hebrides
are much more apt to criticise than to enhearten. Perhaps it is the
climate, or our history, or the gloomy Norwegian genes in our blood, but
we are very good at putting folk down.
When I built my black house in 1994, I was astonished how rude people
were. They said it was impossible. They said I was mad. Seeing it, they
delighted in pointing out mistakes. As the timbers met and the roof
rose, they resorted hopefully to prophesies of collapse. (A blessing on
two good neighbours who egged me on.)
Late that same summer, I tried to organise a farewell event for
Harris's first generation of senior school-leavers. I had to abandon it.
Not a soul was prepared to help. Some enthused, but broke down at early
hurdles. Teachers were profoundly offended that I had even thought of
it.
On an island, you are acutely visible. All the time you are aware of
being watched, assessed, and analysed. This can be exceedingly
depressing. I try now rather to exult in it. If you live, as sincerely
as you can, a blameless and useful life, and know it for yourself, and
look to Christ to cover all else, then you must forget the eyes. The
alternative is paralysis, and there is far too much paralysis in the
Western Isles.
I AM beginning to sound very anti-Harris, so I will stop. There is
much about life here that is good, and rich, and uplifting. And because,
too, I am myself naturally good at dwelling on the dark side; I have had
perhaps half a dozen truly awful experiences in Harris -- a grim night
here, some fearful row there -- but, around that, week upon week and
month upon month of good days, good friends, and gentle times of
happiness.
The church that can oppress offers a framework of familiar liturgy and
the wonder of the Gospel. High social visibility means gossip, but it
also means knowing everybody; it means you have a relationship with the
postman, with the policeman, with the boy who fuels your car, with the
girl in the library. You know their names and their families and their
dogs.
There is, too, my own house. Slowly, I am caring for it and improving
it. The black house, thatched and authentic, replaced two ugly sheds. In
my den, where I write and read and think, I am surrounded by my own
things, and photographs of family and friends. My life has been
brightened immeasurably by the gift of a lovely little dog.
Harris is my home. Even amid the welcome privacy of the city, the
bookshops and streets and the warmth of my family, I find myself
yearning for my house. It is not quite home yet -- and perhaps, this
side of marriage, it will remain a house rather than a home -- but it is
my place and my space. There I have grown; there I am learning about
myself. I am exploring life and its profound ambiguity. I am learning to
love.

John Fowler describes the pleasures and hazards of Martian excursion.
WELCOME to Mars. Imagine yourself a space traveller. Mirrored in your
companion's vizor is the Martian landscape, courtesy of Mark McLellan's
artwork.
You are a pioneer. So far no human has set foot on Mars, though there
have been unmanned landings. The Viking probes reached Mars in the
1970s. Its natural features are huge craters, deep valleys, and towering
mountains. The Grand Canyon would fit easily into the canyon system on
Mars and Martian mountains would dwarf the Himalayas. Three Everests
stacked one on top of the other would be required to match the
25,000-metre Mons Olympus.
Will this set a new challenge for future space-travellers with a
penchant for mountaineering? Only time will tell.
Even time on Mars is a little different, as Mark explains -- every day
is half an hour longer than our days on earth. Theoretically earthmen
McLellan and Fowler might return from an extended Martian excursion to
find themselves older than they thought.
But for the moment the planet is beyond our reach and we must be
content with the long view. The planet is now visible throughout the
night and even with the naked eye its distinctive reddish hue is
apparent. Mark's chart shows where it will be found.
The moon is full on the night of the 15th, giving all young lovers
still basking in the radiance of St Valentine a bonus of romantic
moonlight. (But lovers, wear your thermals.)
Driving eastwards to my home under the Ochil hills last month I
crested a rise to be confronted by a gigantic full moon, a great orb
partially obscured by a moving screen of bare tree-tops, dwarfing the
illuminated clockface in the church tower.
WOW! What makes the moon seem so large when it's lurking low on the
horizon? The sky gospel according to Mark is that it's caused by the
lens effect of the atmosphere. The atmosphere hugs the earth and curves
round with it, so that when you look at the horizon you see the moon
through the curve, as if through the lens of a magnifying glass. By the
time the moon has climbed about a quarter of the way up the sky the
observer is no longer looking through the curve of the atmosphere and
the moon appears once again at its more familiar size.
How about the colour? That orangey glow is caused by the filter of
dust, and sometimes pollution, that hangs suspended in our atmosphere.
Another factor involves the refraction of light, but Mark suggests (and
I agree) that we should steer clear of the physics.
The new moon is next due on March 1, which is Ash Wednesday. I can't
say it will be ''visible'', because a new moon isn't. It is totally in
shadow, before emerging as a thin crescent on the following nights. On
occasion, of course, the new moon may be discerned as a black disc, as
when silhouetted against the bright curtain of the Milky Way.
In winter the southern sky can be spectacular. You should look out for
the Winter Triangle, as it's called, comprising the bright stars Sirius,
Procyon, and Betelgeuse, which can be seen throughout most of the
evening. The chart gives its position.
The constellation to observe this month is Gemini, or the twins,
located high in the southern sky. Its two leading stars are Castor,
classed as a double (really a multiple) star which is made up of six
suns, and Pollux, an orange-coloured single star.
For those who like to spice astronomy with mythology, the twins Castor
and Pollux were considered to be the issue of a little hanky-panky
between the mortal Leda and Zeus, the Mr Big of the gods, who popped
down to see her in the shape of a swan.
After Castor's untimely death the twins were given a home in the
heavens.

Ethiopia, Brighton, Polmont, and Hi-NRG, David Belcher reflects on the
best and worst of times in 1984.
TOMORROW night's instalment of Scottish Television's Time of Your
Life, the audio-visual social history of the decade past, reveals that
1984 was the best of times and the worst of times. On the one hand, the
same year that inspired us with the ethereal Caledonian gorgeousness of
the Blue Nile's Tinseltown In The Rain, Easter Parade, and Heatwave,
from the Glasgow trio's debut LP, was also the year in which we suffered
the horror that was I Should Have Known Better by Jim Diamond.
Lloyd Cole and his commoting Commotions roused us with Perfect Skin
and Are You Ready To Be Heartbroken, while Rod Stewart could only
inspire a nation to shake its head in rueful agreement when he croaked
that Some Guys Have All the Luck. Counter-balancing every perky hit by
Aztec Camera there was a pompous drone by Ultravox; for every soaring
Hi-NRG Bronski Beat anthem, the plodding Lo-NRG of Simple Minds.
In the wider world, famine in Ethiopia pricked the consciences of the
post-punk generation, ably marshalled by Band Aid supremo Bob Geldof,
who successfully persuaded us to part with our cash in the best of good
causes.
Another Bob, the infamous Maxwell, bought the Daily Mirror and
succeeded only in teasing money from the pockets of its pensioners.
THERE was death on the Edinburgh-Glasgow railway line at Polmont.
Death at the Tory Party Conference in Brighton. Death for India's Indira
Gandhi.
In the light of such sad circumstances not even the Selkirk team who
were beaten 20-0 by Stirling Albion in the Scottish Cup would be able to
use the line that football is more important than life and death . . .

GARY Armstrong played one of the games of his life against Ireland
last season. The honours were shared in a dreich 6-6 draw, but so grand
was Armstrong's performance that the erstwhile Ireland flanker, Fergus
Slattery, was moved to declare that if the Jed scrum half hadn't been
playing then the crowd could have demanded a refund.
It was Armstrong's comeback season. Physically and emotionally drained
by the pressures of top-class rugby he had taken a year out.
He was wooed back to the international fold for the Calcutta Cup
match, when he played as if he had never been away. Then came Lansdowne
Road in Dublin.
The comeback came to an abrupt and unhappy end when Armstrong severely
damaged his right thumb. The tendons were stripped from the bone, and
three days later he underwent surgery. He was out for eight weeks.
But that was just the start of an injury nightmare from which the
30-times capped British Lion has still not fully recovered.
He had kept himself fit over the summer and was raring to go at the
start of the season. On August 25, three days before the Selkirk sevens,
he was tackled in a Riverside Park practice match by the Jed full back,
Chris Richard.
Armstrong's left knee crumpled, and the diagnosis was about as bad as
it could be. The cruciate ligament had snapped, the medial ligament --
already damaged two years previously -- had streched and twisted. A
couple of cartilages had been ripped off the bone which, in its own way,
was a blessing because, if they hadn't, the medial ligament would have
snapped as well.
In short, the knee would have to be completely rebuilt. Six weeks
later, once the swelling had died down, Armstrong underwent surgery at
the Princess Margaret Rose Hospital in Edinburgh.
The operation was a success, but he still faced a long haul before he
could even walk properly.
''I was off work for four-and-a-half months and until Christmas I
travelled to Edinburgh three times a week for physiotherapy,'' said
Armstrong.
''I'm still going up once a week and, since the New Year, I've been
doing light weights and jogging down at Riverside Park.
Armstrong has been told that he can take no contact on the knee until
October. ''I hope to play again, but I've no idea at what level, and I
just have to take it one day at a time. Just now when I run the knee is
numb.
''My physio, Lorraine Shepherd, has said that the feeling will come
back, but it is a bit of a worry, because I was speaking to former
Scotland stand-off John Rutherford, who has gone through a similar
thing, and he still has some numbness in his knee,'' said Armstrong.
To repair the knee, the surgeon used ligament material taken from the
kneecap, which was then wrapped in carbon-fibre. Armstrong has been
assured that once the healing process is complete the reconstructed knee
will be stronger than the right one.
''When they put the cruciate ligament in they give it a blood supply,
but that dies off after six months, by which time, so I'm told, the body
grows a fresh one. That's why it's going to take a year to get
completely better,'' he said.
Armstrong, a lorry driver to trade and a prince among scrum halves, is
philosophical about a career which has been blighted by injury.
''It's been tough, but it's been enjoyable. When I couldn't go with
the Lions in 1993 because of a groin injury that was pretty hard to take
and now, all this. I'm just taking each day as it comes. I don't want to
run before I can walk.
''So far as the future is concerned, then I'll just wait and see. I'm
aiming to get back with Jed and, if everything feels OK, then I might
try to win my Scotland place back.
''But that's all in the future and it's something that I'd have to
talk over seriously with my wife, Shona. I've learned the hard way that
it doesn't pay to plan too far ahead.''
And a tip for today's game? ''It will be close, but Scotland to win.
The A team guys in the side are used to winning and I think they'll
carry that habit on from Canada.''

Waterville justifies that overworked description, a classic links
course
To South-west Ireland and the Algarve to sample the Great Game. Which
location comes out on top? Ron Marshall delivers his vote
THE tone was set on our arrival at Ballybunion Golf Club. Noel and
Declan, bank manager and pharmacist respectively, from County Tipperary,
had been drawn to play with two of our journalist colleagues, but were
AWOL. The 9.30 tee-off time, the first of the tournament, had come and
gone.
The youngish official starter, from the genus
pulled-through-hedge-backwards, was unperturbed. His prime concern was
trying to decide from which tee competitors should play. Relief was at
hand, however, as the sponsors' banner was hammered without ceremony
into the back of the yellow teeing area. One query solved.
Howard and Alistair, paired with the missing Irishmen, were quietly
champing at the bit, Howard, the stickler for the rules, studiously
peering at his watch, daring the starter to make a decision as the
adjacent putting green began filling up with a formidably twitchy array
of Americans and Japanese.
''All right, sorr, play away and the other two can catch you up'',
ventured the young hopeful.
Howard choked. ''You mean they won't be playing the full 18?'' he
demanded (they were, after all, part of another team and therefore
rivals in the competition).
''Oh yes, sorr. They'll play the holes they miss when they've
finished!'' Howard, who knows a thing or two about organising sports
events, and about the Rules of the R and A, barely maintained a veneer
of sanity as he absorbed the lad's logic, squinted around in desperation
for some higher authority, wisely decided against argument, and
immediately hit off -- pretty impressively, too, under the
circumstances.
A few minutes later, a couple of dishevelled wrecks hobbled past on
the way down the first fairway, their fellow competitors already holing
out on the first green. As we discovered a few hours later, a night's
carousing in Killarney meant the bold boys had embraced Morpheus too
little, and certainly too late. And, as we were to learn over the
ensuing three nights, their stamina in combating sleep, an endless
onslaught of Guinness, and all-night piano sing-songs made the tasks of
Hercules look positively wimpish.
But what's this all about, you ask. Simple. In the past few months the
opportunity has arisen to sample the Great Game in two distinctly
contrasting ambiences, the first among the myths and legends, the
mountains and lakes, of the Ring of Kerry in south-west Ireland, and not
least their celebrated golf courses at Ballybunion, Waterville, and
Killarney.
The second, in response to a plea from the Portuguese tourist
industry, was in the Algarve region -- and who dares turn down such an
approach? As younger son says so understandingly, somebody has to do it.
But back to the Emerald Isle. For the past two years Jamesons, the
world's largest-selling Irish whiskey, have sponsored a truly
cosmopolitan golf gathering in what must be one of the country's most
captivating corners; County Kerry, all russets and purples in late
autumn, the mighty Atlantic as a backdrop, would grace any canvas.
Nearly 200 players, all amateurs, from 17 countries made up 45 teams,
40% of which had made the journey from the United States for the
Jamesons International Golf Challenge. It was hardly surprising, then,
after the tournament's three rounds that our colonial cousins garnered a
sizeable share of the booty. Mind you, the previous year a team from
Georgia was diplomatically urged not to darken the doorstep again after
some improbably low scoring was matched by some suspiciously high
handicaps.
One of the highlights of the entire five days was the visit of UK
trade guests and the media to the Jameson Heritage Centre, at Midleton
near Cork. Released from the rigours of the links for a few hours, we
could only marvel at the way the original distillery, in operation from
1825 to 1975, had been restored in every detail with evidently loving
care.
The huge waterwheel, for example, built 140 years ago and which
provided power for the operation, is still in working order, and other
major components have been extensively refurbished -- mills, maltings,
stillhouses, warehouses, and kilns. They're particularly proud of the
enormous pot still; it's said to be the largest in the world, with a
capacity of more than 30,000 gallons.
Overseeing the whole operation is Michael Borre, whose card describes
him as sales manager, export operations, Great Britain -- not an
Irishman, as you might expect, but a Dane whose enthusiasm to find the
right words to describe his company's best-known product gets in the way
of the final delivery. But you get the drift all right: ''manufacture
unchanged for centuries . . . special taste comes from malted and
unmalted barleys . . . dried in closed kilns to preserve the flavour,
unlike Scotch whose bouquet and smoky taste come from peat fires . . .
etc, etc.''
What certainly has been unchanged for centuries is the scenery on the
Ring of Kerry, a 135-mile magical mystery tour of cliffs, seascapes,
lakes, and glacial corries, where the coach drivers' unwritten rule is
that all journeys are made round the peninsula in an anti-clockwise
direction. One trip on the narrow roads explains why.
But don't be put off. Nobody's in a hurry (well, nobody except Howard,
our resident Juan Fangio, who managed to slice 20 minutes off the
organisers' recommended one hour 30 minutes to Waterville from Killarney
-- and probably five years off the life of Bryan, a team-mate in the
journalists' quartet whose right foot pumped an imaginary brake at
almost every bend).
Waterville, halfway round the Ring from Killarney, more than justifies
that overworked description, a classic links course. Construction money
almost 30 years ago came from an Irish-American, John Mulcahy -- and,
boy, did he make some job of it.
Comparison with Turnberry is fair, and if Waterville weren't so remote
it would surely host more top tournaments.
Continuing round the Ring the most significant stop-off places are
near Caherdaniel, boasting one of the best-preserved stone forts in
Ireland, and Sneem, famous only for having General de Gaulle on his
hollybags there in 1963. To mark the twenty-first anniversary, the
locals erected a memorial on the village green last year. It's already
known as ''de Gaullestone''.
Which reference takes us back to Continental Europe, where the Algarve
region of Portugal became so concerned about decreasing numbers of
tourists that #1m was set aside by the country's government to
regenerate interest, particularly from the UK and Germany.
Mario Lage, secretary of the Algarve Golfing Association, says 1994's
influx of tourists was better than '93, which I understand was a
disappointing year. Golfing counter-attractions in Spain and even
Tunisia siphoned off some of the trade, so a promotional push was put
into operation.
Thus 40 teams of four (10 each from Britain, Germany, Spain, and
Portugal) descended on the splendid five-star Marinotel at Vilamoura
recently to a welcome rise of temperature, but a less friendly
thunderstorm which wiped out the first round of the 36-hole Algarve Land
of Golf Pro-Am.
Each team comprised a professional and three amateurs, but in my case,
partnered by the Hilton Park assistant Stewart Russell plus two of his
club's well-known members, Syd McDonald and Bobby Millen (between them
they've won the club's championship nine times), it wasn't so much a
pro-am as, in the words of Douglas Lowe of this paper's sports staff, an
''am-pro''.
The big name among the professionals was the 6ft 5in Englishman who
was twice runner-up in the Open Championship, 46-year-old Peter
Oosterhuis. Four times Europe's No 1 golfer in the 70s, Peter is still a
majestic striker of the ball. ''He was hitting the pins out the hole
with every club'', reported one of his playing partners, Malcolm
Campbell, Golf Monthly's travel editor, ''but he just couldn't hole a
putt.'' That was over the beautiful Quinta do Lago course, where, it
should be noted, young Stewart scored 73 to big Peter's 77, and finished
a commendable seventh.
The Algarve boasts 17 courses, ranged along a magnificent sandy
coastline stretching west of Faro airport for about 60 miles. A handful
of layouts set the ball rolling in the mid-70s -- Penina, Vale do Lobo,
Vilamoura, and slightly later Palmares were the first courses to draw
golfers, mainly from Britain.
More recently, exquisite additions to the originals include San
Lorenzo near Quinta do Lago, Vila Sol, close to the three Vilamoura
courses, and not least Sir Henry Cotton's last course design at Alto
near the village of Alvor.
So -- where does the vote go -- Ireland or Portugal? That's like
asking a starving man if he'd prefer Chateaubriand or smoked salmon. On
the hospitality front the folk from Kerry have it hands down. The
courses in both areas are exceptional, Portugal certainly with wonderful
weather (notwithstanding our thunderstorm) in its favour. The only
recommendation, really, is to pack your clubs and try both. You won't
regret it.

DENIS McBride, the Irish open side, is in the traditional mould of 5ft
10in fliers, adept at getting to the breakdown ahead of the opposition,
and his presence means that the Scots, themselves with a recast back
row, will be drawn into a classic game of cat-and-mouse for recycling
possession.
McBride follows in a long line of Irish wing forwards, perhaps the
most notable being the redoubtable Fergus Slattery, a freak if ever
there was one.
I remember having just returned from the 1980 Lions tour and being
picked for a Scotland/Ireland side to play England/Wales at Cardiff Arms
Park. My wing forwards were to be Slattery and that mad doctor John
O'Driscoll.
Slattery, in my eyes, was then an old man. Unknown to me, he had
called off the tour because of work commitments. I was bum fit, and I
mean flying, after months on the high veldt. At training on the Friday
before the game, in mixed groups of forwards and backs, we did an
exercise where we ran, at full tilt, the length of the pitch, then the
end, and back down the other side, with the man at the back, supposedly,
coming to take the ball.
Well, would you believe it, Slattery, who was in my group, hit the
front immediately and ran on with the ball. No-one could catch him.
Nobody got near him, for 10 runs, not even a back. That was what I call
freak fitness.
Whether any of the back-row boys today have that kind of running power
remains to be seen, but the battle of the loosies will win and lose the
game, without a shadow of a doubt.
To my mind the two sets of breakaways are similar, very much
traditional in their casting. Two inexperienced No.8s in Eric Peters and
Ben Cronin, two big blind sides with Rob Wainwright up against Anthony
Foley, and two tough grafters in Iain Morrison and McBride.
Therefore the lineout should be shared at the tail, and given Peter
Wright's assumption that the scrummages will be even, it all boils down
to who does what when roaming the pitch.
Very interesting it is that, with the Scots having changed their
method of play, much more now depends on the Scottish ability to
generate more yards up the pitch with the ball in hand before the final,
inevitable ruck.
Fascinating, too, that with Wainwright packing on the blind side of
the scrum, opportunities will have to be manufactured to get him into
space with the ball in hand, which is his talent.
Now, if we assume that Ian Jardine is to be used to get to the gain
line quickly from scrums and lineouts, then Morrison and Peters will be
told to look for the pass from Jardine, if he can produce one, or get
ready to create fast ruck ball if he can't.
Trying to read between the lines, there's little point in having
Wainwright heading into that ruck. Instead, I expect he, and Peter
Wright, will be asked to look for the short pass from Bryan Redpath to
take the ball on further, and the next ruck used to give Townsend and
Logan some ball to explode with.
Which means that the Irish will be asked a different set of questions
from those they might have expected from a Scottish side of the last few
seasons. Last year, in Dublin, the Scots produced one of the best
rucking displays I had ever seen, ably supported by Gary Armstrong, but
that didn't win the game as the defence fanned out on each successive
ruck.
Scotland's defence will undoubtedly be tested, too, with Foley's
rampaging runs. To my mind, it will all be decided on how Scotland cope
with Ireland's ability with the ball in hand out wide, and in rolling
mauls and lineouts, where they will release the devastating Nick
Popplewell, and how Ireland fare against an early aerial bombardment
peppered with quick ball release and the back-row taking the ball
upfield.
Slattery would have revelled in it, and I would pay to get back on the
pitch. There's no chance of that, so we just have to wait.
Honest, it's enough to make a grown man tremble with anticipation.

PROVIDED the meteorological conditions are in favour, a capacity
audience for the first Five Nations' Championship match in the new
Murrayfield will be hopeful that those Scots who have that priceless
commodity of genuine pace will be brought into the action as often as
possible.
Craig Joiner and Kenny Logan, on the wings, and Gregor Townsend each
can bullet off the mark, as well as having other attributes of
deception. It isn't easy in current international action to create
fertile conditions within which such special talents can prosper, but it
will be a waste if efforts are not made to give those three a run at the
opposition in space.
Scotland do have the Craig Chalmers boot and just about the most
effective crash target man in the championship in Ian Jardine, whose
purposeful penetration and placements against Canada hardly could have
been excelled. However, Noel Murphy, Ireland's manager, reckoned their
surprise win over England at Twickenham a year ago was mostly
attributable to Ireland knowing exactly how England would play.
Logan doesn't require much in the way of aid. He is so full of
get-up-and-go and maturing judgment as to have the capacity this season
for making a little go quite a long way. Joiner just needs an
opportunity of the kind he enjoys regularly at the Greenyards for him to
establish his confidence in the big time. Townsend requires only a sniff
of an opening to have opponents reaching for the panic button.
In the Canadian game, Townsend took up the inside centre berth at a
lineout won by Stewart Campbell, was then missed out by Chalmers, but
looped Jardine and almost got his pass away to Joiner and Gavin Hastings
in full cry. It might have worked if lineout ball had been delivered
quicker, because when such ball is driven, defenders tend not to move
back with the maul, but to encroach illegally behind the referee's back,
thus closing down the options.
Of course, Townsend's full value in attack would be realised from
quick second or third-phase ball with its fleeting opportunity of
running at a momentarily splintered defence.
It was encouraging to see Chalmers taking subsequent phase ball flat
against Canada, so threatening the gain line early, and Hastings is
still a formidable target, especially in thundering up the narrow side
following a pick-up move to the open. Eric Peters is pretty quick into
his running to the right off a scrummage pick-up, and Rob Wainwright
links well to the left, although Scotland do miss the bullocking bulk of
Peter Walton.
No doubt the Scots will want to examine the fringe defence of a new
look Irish loose forward trio, but Scotland's breakaways wil have to
look to their laurels in dealing with ground and 50-50 ball as Ireland
have restored that wily member of the smaller flank forward brigade,
Denis McBride.
All of which presupposes that Scotland's pack will regularly put their
backs on the front foot with the quality of their delivery, and that
applies especially to stoppage points. This Irish eight, however, even
with three comparative international novices in their back five, still
can be guaranteed to burst their boilers in responding to the mature
leadership of McBride.
Nor should Scotland underrate the new stand-off, Paul Burke, who was
placed on a tight leash by the English but has the light-footed look of
a Welsh stand-off. There is, too, a lively and bulky jackrabbit with
licence to pop up unexpectedly in left wing Jonathan Bell, to say
nothing of the electric sizzle that is part of the Simon Geoghegan
repertoire.
Will Carling rates Ireland as ''a very good side who will go well this
season.'' Geoff Cooke reckons they will beat Scotland by six clear
points. Yet six are new to a major international at Murrayfield and
there have been changes in each section except the front row, making it
that bit harder for Gerry Murphy and Pat Whelan to oil all the hinges in
achieving gel.
Scotland will seek to quench early Irish fire by establishing control
in ball supply and retention, then must take play to the Irish in
positive style and with ball kept alive in as much continuous action as
feasible.
Victory thus achieved and by releasing the speedsters really would
lift the spirit. Of the 18 Scottish tries in the last 10 games against
Ireland 15 have been by the backs, 11 by the ''quickies.''

NEW YEAR'S DAY was blessed with good weather and the streets
throughout the day were busy with holiday-makers. Whether this was a
result of the good weather or because the public houses were closed is
not recorded.
The Herald reported on the holiday soccer match between Rangers and
Celtic, speculating that it ''has all the appearance of becoming an
annual institution''. In front of a crowd of 16,000 at Ibrox Park, the
victors, by three goals to two, were Celtic.
Later in the year the annual soccer match between England and Scotland
was a closely fought affair, with home advantage proving just enough for
the English, who snatched victory by three goals to nil. However, the
good news for Scottish football supporters is that in matches between
the two nations this was only the seventh victory for the English while
the Scots had recorded 11 wins.
Bank interest rates were a topic of considerable discussion. The Bank
of England base rate started the year at 2%, having fallen 1% over the
previous 12 months. The English banks followed suit and reduced the rate
paid for funds on deposit to one-half of 1%. However, the Scottish banks
continued to pay 1[1/2]% -- three times as much -- until the beginning
of February. Clearly this caused great consternation with the Bank of
England since only after several meetings were the Scottish clearers
persuaded to reduce their rate to 1%. For those of us currently
concerned about overdraft interest rates, in 1895 one would have paid
5%.
Still on the subject of Scottish banks, it was reported that the
directors of the Clydesdale Bank expressed deep regret that exceptional
losses amounting to more than #114,000 had been made at its branch in
Dundee. This amount represented one-fifth of the bank's entire reserved
surplus fund, against which it had to be written off.
In 1895 the Japanese port of Kobe was in the news. One hundred years
ago this week peace envoys from China arrived at Kobe to try to find a
solution to the war between Japan and China, a war which for the Chinese
was becoming a disastrous conflict. None the less, by the middle of May
the war was over, with one of the terms of peace the recognition by
China of the full and complete independence of Korea. In addition, China
agreed to pay to Japan as a war indemnity the equivalent of #33m.
The Opium Commission, appointed to inquire into the alleged evils
arising from the use of that drug in India, reported that the abuse of
opium as a drug for smoking purposes was much less than had been stated
by some. While the commissioners were opposed to anything of the nature
of prohibition, they did make some suggestions as to the regulation and
restriction of traffic and also recommended the Government put a stop to
the smoking of opium on licensed premises.
The year 1895 will probably best be remembered for events in the world
of politics, which were regarded at the time as a national interest. The
question of home rule was raised in the House of Commons with the member
for Kirkcaldy bringing forward a resolution which expressed the
desirability of establishing local legislative assemblies in order to
give speedier and fuller effect to the special desires and wants of the
respective nationalities constituting the United Kingdom. It was stated
that, to increase the efficiency of the Imperial Parliament to deal with
Imperial affairs, it was desirable to devolve upon the legislatures in
Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and England respectively the management and
control of their domestic affairs. The resolution was seconded by Mr
Lloyd George and was carried by 128 votes to 102.
In March a resolution was brought forward in favour of the payment of
members of Parliament and this was carried by 18 votes. The Chancellor
of the Exchequer said this was inevitable after the great extension of
the suffrage and the march of democratic opinion. To say that -- because
they were going to admit a larger number of men who had very small
fortunes -- they would introduce corruption into Parliament, was to form
an unjust conclusion on premises which did not support it, and he did
not see why the House of Commons should lose any of the respect and
confidence of the country because it contained a greater number of
representatives of the different classes in this country.
The Budget was introduced on May 2 with the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Sir William Harcourt, revealing a surplus for the previous
fiscal year of #776,000. Tobacco and beer had yielded the revenue
anticipated of them, but wines and spirits had not realised
expectations. The increase in death duties the previous year had brought
in an extra million pounds to the Treasury, and speculation on the Stock
Exchange, and particularly mining speculation, had brought in an
additional half million. The Chancellor went on to reveal a prospective
deficit for 1895/96, prior to duties on beer and spirits. However, this
would be turned into a surplus simply by reimposing the additional tax
on beer of 6d per barrel.
The Government had lost seats in a number of by-elections and, after
its defeat in a vote on a formal motion to reduce the salary of the
Secretary of War, its position had become untenable. Following a series
of Cabinet meetings, the Liberal Prime Minister, Lord Roseberry -- who
had been elected the previous year following the resignation of Mr
Gladstone -- went to Windsor to tender the resignation of the Cabinet to
the Queen.
The General Election campaign was fought increasingly on the issue of
home rule. The result was a resounding victory for the Unionists, with
the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies enjoying a majority
of 152, although the Tories by themselves were actually more numerous
than all the other groups put together. I wonder what odds the
bookmakers would give today against a similar outcome at the next
General Election.
In 1895 a school teacher would earn about #70 per annum, but then The
Herald could be bought for 1d, and the aforementioned newspaper
advertised a complete set of teeth for sale at one guinea and a single
tooth could be bought for 2/6d. Significantly, however, five years
warranty was provided. One could go on a day trip to Rothesay for 1/6d,
although any traveller wishing access to the saloon was required to pay
2/-. A trip to the theatre would cost between 6d and 3/-.
The property adverts made particularly interesting reading. In that
leafy and rather salubrious suburb of Glasgow known as Lenzie, there was
for sale in 1895 a two-storey villa comprising drawing room, dining
room, parlour, four bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, scullery, workhouse,
and large garden -- the upset price was #550.
In one well-reported court case it was proved that a 54-year-old
commercial traveller had gone through a form of marriage with at least
five women and was the father of 23 children. He was sentenced to seven
years' penal servitude and presumably was grateful for the opportunity
of some rest.
In high society court cases one cannot ignore the Tasker case in which
a husband and wife brought cross suits for divorce. Apparently, while
cross-examined, Mrs Tasker denied that during a dispute on their yacht
she gave her husband a black eye. She also denied that her husband
attempted to prevent her taking poison when she had a bottle in her
hand. However, she did admit to saying to her husband that his mother
was a barmaid and that barmaids were not the right thing.
She also admitted attending a masquerade ball in her husband's
absence, but not in fancy dress. One witness said he had seen Tasker
strike his wife with a clenched fist and had heard him curse and swear
at her, and went on to say that he was generally unkind whether sober or
drunk. For his part, Mr Tasker said his wife had made ''stupid of
herself and was playing before the servants''. One wonders what the
tabloids would make of such a story today.
In terms of the weather, 1895 was a year of extremes. One report
showed that the Clyde froze in March. Small steamers were used as
ice-breakers to create passage for the bigger traffic and the ice
dragged large passenger ships from their moorings in the docks.
In sharp contrast, it was noted that on September 24 the thermometer
in London registered 86 degrees in the shade and 130 degrees in the sun,
the highest recorded at so late a date, and the hottest day of the year.
In September, races were held for the America's Cup between the
American Defender and the British yacht Valkyrie III which had been
built at the Meadowside yard on the Clyde under cover and amid great
secrecy. In 1895 there were high hopes for the British vessel.
Disappointingly, however, in the first of five races she was defeated
over a 30-mile course by more than eight minutes. In the second race
Valkyrie won by 47 seconds, but a protest was lodged due to a collision
just before the start. The Defender's top-mast shrouds were damaged and
the protest was upheld by the New York Yacht Club, prompting The Herald
to comment that ''it is hard to be robbed of victory''.
Two days later the British yacht was withdrawn from the third race due
to the crowding of excursion steamers and other craft, giving the
Defender the three victories that entitled her to the cup. The Herald
reporter commented, ''so ends one of the greatest fiascos in the annals
of sport''. Clearly upset by the outcome, he went on to say: ''One can
hardly believe that the result is any more satisfactory to honourable
American sportsmen than it is to those of our country.''
Later that month there was a daring robbery of silver. A train from
Swansea to St Pancras took a consignment of 31 silver ingots, valued at
#4800. The silver was handed over to a waggoner who drove away with it.
He stopped outside a neighbouring coffee house, went inside for 20
minutes, and when he came out the van was gone. Almost before the affair
could be reported to the police, the van was found about a mile away,
but, surprise surprise, the silver was gone. Apparently all but four of
the ingots were subsequently recovered by the police but the report did
not state whether the waggoner was employed by Group 4.
One hundred years ago the letters to The Herald were on a wide range
of subjects including the taxation of land values, the level of traffic
on Argyle Street, Scottish banking reforms, dog muzzling, and the Church
and national independence. However, the favourite subject was
dissatisfaction with railway services, with complaints about late
running services and the discontinuance of certain local services. In
one letter towards the end of the year the writer complained that on a
Glasgow to Liverpool train there was no third-class compartment with
lavatory accommodation.
In October The Herald came out with its view on the long-running
discussions on the merits of the terms ''Scottish'', ''Scots'', and
''Scotch''. The paper stated that it was perfectly understandable that
good Scotsmen should dislike the spelling ''Scotch'', which it said
suggested the sneer of the southerner. The article went on to describe
the term ''Scots'' as primeval, while acknowledging that it did have the
weight of antiquity on its side, as our ancestors in their days of
unruly independence denoted all their national belongings by the term.
John Knox was one of the first of our countrymen to use what was then
the Anglicised form ''Scottish'', and its use by most of our best
writers during the preceding two centuries persuaded The Herald that
''for the average Scotsman the moderate and unaggressive 'Scottish'
should be quite sufficient. A term which was good enough for John Knox
and David Hume, Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott ought to be good
enough for him.''
It seems that in 1895 the Princess of Wales was a bit of a keep-fit
enthusiast. An advertisement at the time reveals that she had personally
ordered a horse-action saddle. This was purported to be ''nature's true
remedy, as apparently it was acknowledged by the most eminent members of
the medical profession to be the best of all remedies for diseases
requiring stimulative action''. It was stated that horse exercise brings
all the vital organs and muscular forces into play and both brightens
the brain and increases the physical power. To the best of my knowledge,
no secret photographs were taken of the Princess of Wales using her
horse-action saddle.
Eighteen-ninety-five saw a number of disasters ranging from collapsed
coal mines to railway catastrophes, but sadly the year was marked by
terrible loss of life at sea. In January the North German steamer Elbe
was run into by the steamship Crathie of Aberdeen. The Elbe sank rapidly
and 300 lost their lives. In March a Spanish cruiser was caught in a
violent gale and foundered close to the entrance to the Straits of
Gibraltar with the loss of over 400. Three disasters that occurred in
May to foreign vessels were responsible for the loss of 500 lives and
unfortunately there were many more ships that sank during the year with
considerable loss of life.
In November there was a major labour dispute which resulted in 7000
Clydeside shipworkers being idle. Engineers in the yards had asked for a
small advance of wages, which the masters at first seemed disposed to
concede, but before a decision was arrived at, there was a grave
difference of opinion as to the cause of the dispute, which resulted in
a lock-out by the masters. The strike very soon began to tell seriously
on other classes of tradesmen employed in the yards -- on riveters,
joiners, and labourers, a number of whom had to be paid off. Several
firms at once put their yards on short time, and by the close of the
year there was still no sign of any speedy conclusion to the dispute.
International relations also became particularly strained at the end
of the year when President Cleveland sent to Congress a message in which
he claimed for the United States the right to settle the boundaries
between British Guiana and Venezuela, adding that Britain would have to
accept its decision under penalty of war. In Britain, men of all parties
and newspapers representing all opinions replied with a dignified
protest to the pretension that the United States had any right to
influence such a decision.
The Herald made the point that Great Britain was a power in existence
on the American Continent long before the Republic of the United States
was born, and described President Cleveland's uttering as ''irrational
pretensions and claptrap menaces''. For several days, politicians in the
United States, with a few exceptions, gave themselves up to a delirium
of jingoism, but the bankers, merchants, and thoughtful classes in the
States, including some of the principal newspapers, interposed with
wiser counsels, and before the year was over, virtually all possibility
of war had disappeared.
In the Stock Exchange, 1895 will be remembered for the ''Kaffir''
boom, which was due largely to the discovery of the Witwatersrand
goldfields in the Transvaal and there followed a widespread speculative
mania.
However, towards the end of the year many investors suffered heavy
losses when South African stock prices collapsed, partly due to the
threat of a revolution. The Boers, numbering some 20,000, were keeping
to themselves the whole political power of the country, and the people
whose labour and capital had enriched the once impoverished republic
were deprived of any real voice in the management of public affairs.
Public meetings and petitions had no success and it was clear that a
crisis was looming.
The sharp decline in value of South African stocks and the American
war scare were two of the major factors that led to a disastrous
year-end for the UK stock market, The Herald describing it as ''a season
after the bears' own heart''. Ladies and Gentlemen, there is at least
one person here this evening who will be hoping that 100 years on this
particular piece of history does not repeat itself.
In high society court cases one cannot ignore the Tasker case in which
Mrs Tasker admitted attending a masquerade ball in her husband's
absence, but not in fancy dress

CONOR O'SHEA
(Lansdowne)
Age 24, 6ft 2ins, 15st, 9 caps.
Conor O'Shea played in the defeat against England and was replaced for
the Murrayfield game by Jim Staples. However, Staples is a flu victim
and O'Shea returns. He was first capped against Romania in 1993 and was
ever present during the 1994 Five Nations' tournament. Toured Australia
with Ireland last summer and was in the side which met the USA last
November.
14
SIMON GEOGHEGAN
(Bath)
Right wing: Age 26, 6ft, 14st, 25 caps.
Simon Geoghegan is one of the most exciting and unpredictable runners
in Five Nations' rugby. A livewire wing-threequarter who is guaranteed
to prove a handful for his opposite number, he made his international
debut against France in 1991 and went on to score tries in the remaining
matches against Wales, England and Scotland. For his efforts he was
named as Ireland's ''Player of the Year''. Moved from London Irish to
Bath this season.
13
BRENDAN MULLIN
(Blackrock College)
Centre: Age 31, 6ft 1ins, 13st 3lbs, 47 caps.
Brendan Mullin returned to international rugby this season after a
33-month absence for ''personal and business'' reasons. A classy
midfield performer, he embarked upon his rugby sabbatical after the 1991
World Cup and the 1992 Five Nations' championship. He was a 1989 Lion in
Australia where he played in the first Test and also played for the
Lions against the IRFB centenary game against the Rest of the World in
1986 and for the Home Nations against France in 1989.
12
PHILIP DANAHER
(Garryowen)
Centre: Age 29, 5ft 11ins, 13st 10lbs, 25 caps.
Philip Danaher made his international debut at fullback in the 22-18
defeat of Scotland in 1988. Originally a fly-half, where he played for
Irish schools in 1982, he was in and out of the Ireland side until he
made his return against Scotland in 1992 after which he was made captain
and skippered the Irish on their NZ tour. He was still captain against
Australia later that year and, although relinquishing the captaincy, has
been a fixture in the side ever since.
11
JONATHAN BELL
(Ballymena)
Left wing: Age 20, 5ft 11ins, 14st 7lbs, 3 caps.
Jonathan Bell, who celebrates his 21st birthday on Tuesday, has made a
rapid rise to prominence, emerging after making his U21 debut against
the NZ Rugby Newa Youth side at Donnybrook in 1993. He was called into
the senior squad for the tour to Australia last year where he appeared
in six of the eight games, and played in both Tests at centre. His first
outing on the wing came against the United States last November.
10
PAUL BURKE
(Cork Constitution)
Stand-off: Age 21, 5ft 8ins, 12st, one cap.
Paul Burke made his Ireland debut against England a fortnight ago. As
an expatriate Irishman he first played for England at schools, U18,
colts and U21 level. But, with a father from Galway and mother from
Kildare, he declared allegiance to the Irish cause in 1992 and had
subsequent outings for the Irish U21 and 'A' sides. Moved from London
Irish to Cork this season and is now a PE teacher at Christian Brothers'
College, Cork.
9
MICHAEL BRADLEY
(Cork Constitution)
Scrumhalf: Age 32, 5ft 10ins, 13st 2lbs, 37 caps.
Michael Bradley is Ireland's most capped scrumhalf. He made his
Ireland debut against Australia in 1984 and was a member of the Irish
Triple Crown side the following year. After 22 consecutive appearances
he lost his place to Fergus Aherne in 1988 but returned to the side two
years later only to lose out to Alain Rolland. Did not play againt
England following the death of his son. Resumes as captain.
1
NICK POPPLEWELL
(Wasps)
Loose-head prop: Age 30, 5ft 10ins, 17st 3lbs, 25 caps.
Nick Popplewell is the senior partner in the much vaunted Irish front
row. He made his Ireland debut in 1989 against the All Blacks but was
injured and missed the following year's Five Nations' championship. He
played against Argentina in 1990 but missed selection for the 1991
championship. Returned against Namibia and has been a permanent fixture
since. A strong scrummager and handy in the loose, he played all three
Tests as a 1993 Lion in New Zealand.
2
KEITH WOOD
(Garryowen)
Hooker: Age 23, 6ft, 15st 12lbs, 4 caps.
Keith Wood is a product of the splendidly named St Munchin's College,
Limerick. Comes to Murrayfield today with a growing reputation. His
father, Gordon, was an Irish internationalist and a 1959 British Lion.
Keith won his first 'A' cap against Scotland in 1993 and was a bench
replacement for the 1994 championship. Played in both Tests on the
Australian tour later that year.

PETER CLOHESSY
(Young Munster)
Tight-head prop: Age 28, 5ft 11ins, 16st, 11 caps.
Peter Clohessy is an uncompromising front-row forward and achieved a
degree of notoriety in Munster's rough-house encounter with the touring
Australians in 1992. He made his international debut against France in
1993 and went on to play against Wales and England the same season. Last
season, due to suspension, he missed the match against Romania but
returned to the full international side in the championship opener
against France via two outings in the Ireland 'A' side.
4
PADDY JOHNS
(Dungannon)
Lock: Age 26, 6ft 6ins, 16st 10lbs, 17 caps.
Paddy Johns is another back-five utility forward, having made his
debut at lock against the Pumas in 1990. Played at No.8 against England.
He first represented Ireland at schools level and went on to figure in
U21, U25 and 'B' sides. At Newcastle University he played for Gosforth
and then enlisted with Dublin University. Irish selectors still chose
him as a lock until Wales last year when he won his first full cap at
No.8.
5
GABRIEL FULCHER
Lock: Age 25, 6ft 5in, 17st, 3 caps
Gabriel Fulcher came on as a replacement for the injured Neil Francis
during Ireland' last outing against England. Retains his place today. He
is a former Irish Schools' cap and climbed the representative ladder via
the Irish U21 and 'B' sides. He toured with the Irish development squad
to Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa in the summer of 1993 and gained
promotion to the senior squad for the Australian tour when he won his
first cap in the second Test.
6
ANTHONY FOLEY
(Shannon)
Flanker: Age 21, 6ft 3ins, 16st 8lbs, one cap.
Anthony Foley won his first cap against England a fortnight ago. He
follows the example set by his father, Brendan, who won eleven caps in
the Irish second row between 1976 and 1981. Young Foley has represented
Ireland at schools, student, and U21 level. He owes his inclusion in the
national side to some stirring performances with championship-chasing
Shannon in the all-Ireland league.
7
DENIS McBRIDE
(Malone)
Flanker: Age 30, 5ft 10ins, 13st 10lbs, 15 caps.
Denis McBride returns to the Irish side as open-side flanker to the
exclusion of David Corkery who played against England. McBride's last
appearance in an Irish jersey was as a replacement in the second Test
against Australia in Sydney last June. McBride is a rarity in top-class
rugby in that he is a genuine open-side player. Captained Irish
Wolfhounds to victory at Melrose Sevens.
8
BEN CRONIN
(Garryowen)
No.8: Age 26, 6ft 5ins, 16st 2lbs, uncapped.
Ben Cronin is the only new cap in the recast Irish side. He was
selected to play for Ireland against the USA last November but a
fractured cheekbone kept him on the sidelines. He was born in Limerick
and educated at Cistercia College, Roscrea. Played for the Waterpark
Club in Waterford before switching to Garryowen four years ago.
Replacements : Niall Woods (Blackrock College), Eric Elwood
(Lansdowne), Niall Hogan (Terenure College), Mick Galwey (Shannon),
Garrett Halpin (London Irish), Terence Kingston (Dolphin).

GAVIN HASTINGS
(Watsonians) captain
Fullback: Age 33, 6ft 2ins, 14st 8lbs, 52 caps.
Gavin Hastings creates a new Scottish cap record today when he
overhauls the 52-mark shared with Colin Deans and Jim Renwick. He is
also Scotland's record points scorer in internationals. His 17 points
from Scotland's last outing against Canada gives him a Scottish
international tally of 488. He has made six Test appearances for the
British Lions and captained the tourists in New Zealand in 1993.
14
CRAIG JOINER
(Melrose)
Right wing: Age 20, 5ft 10ins, 13st 10lbs, 3 caps.
Craig Joiner won his first two caps on last summer's tour to
Argentina. He made his Murrayfield debut a fortnight ago against Canada.
While at Merchiston Castle school in Edinburgh he was a member of the
Scottish schools sprint squad. He has played for Scotland at U18, U19
and U21 levels. He was also a member of the successful 'A' team which
scored wins over South Africa and Italy.
13
GREGOR TOWNSEND
(Gala)
Centre: Age 21, 5ft 11ins, 12st 7lbs, 8 caps.
Gregor Townsend gained his first cap as a replacement for the injured
Craig Chalmers against England in 1993. Today he appears in the outside
centre berth, as he did against Canada a fortnight ago. He has also worn
a Scotland shirt at inside centre and fly-half, his club position and
the role in which he first made his mark as a player of exceptional --
if sometimes accident-prone -- flair and pace.
12
IAN JARDINE
(Stirling County)
Centre: Age 29, 6ft 1ins, 13st 7lbs, 6 caps.
Ian Jardine has been a 13-season regular with championship chasing
Stirling County and is noted as a rock-steady midfield player. He was at
the core of Scotland's driving play against the Canadians at Murrayfield
a fortnight ago, giving a rejuvenated pack a target on which to play
off. He made his Scotland debut in the best forgotten game against the
All Blacks in 1993 but survived the experience to stake a belated claim
for further Scotland honours.
11
KENNY LOGAN
(Stirling County)
Left wing: Age 22, 6ft 1in, 13st 8lbs, 11 caps.
Kenny Logan, who became his club's first international when he was
capped against Australia during Scotland's 1992 tour, has been one of
the recent success stories of Scottish rugby. Ever eager and blessed
with an innate self-belief he would have scored his second try in a
Scotland jersey against the Canadians a fortnight ago had it not been
for a wayward foot in touch.
10
CRAIG CHALMERS
(Melrose)
Stand-off: Age 26, 5ft 10ins, 13st 6lbs, 37 caps.
Craig Chalmers showed against Canada last time out that he had
recovered the commanding presence which he had displayed in a Scotland
shirt since his debut as a youngster against Wales in 1989 when he
scored a drop goal and a try. He was a British Lion in Australia the
same year when he played in the first Test, scoring a drop goal and a
penalty goal.
9
BRYAN REDPATH
(Melrose)
Scrumhalf: Age 23, 5ft 7ins, 10st 10lbs, 6 caps.
Bryan Redpath, or ''Basil'' to his friends, unusually won his first
two caps as a replacement (against NZ in 1993 and England in 1994). He
made his debut as a first-choice player against France in 1994 following
Gary Armstrong's hand injury in the game against Ireland. He forms an
all-Melrose half-back partnership with Craig Chalmers and has played
five times for Scotland 'A'.
1
DAVID HILTON
(Bath)
Loose-head prop: Age 24, 5ft 10ins, 16st 4lbs, one cap.
David Hilton owes his Scottish selection to an Edinburgh-born paternal
grandfather, a back injury to Bristol's Alan Sharp and impressive
performances with the district championship-winning Scottish Exiles. He
was enlisted for the Scotland 'A' sides which beat South Africa and
Italy and acquitted himself well against the Canadians a fortnight ago.
He turned down the opportunity to enrol with the SW England squad to
pursue a cap with Scotland.
2
KENNY MILNE
(Heriot's FP)
Hooker: Age 33, 6ft, 15st 12lbs, 32 caps.
Kenny Milne is the Baby Bear of the Milne clan and the youngest of
three brothers to have played in the Scotland front row. The family
chalked up a unique record when, with Iain and David, the Scotland
hooker comprised the Barbarians front row against East Midlands in 1989.
He was Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam hooker and toured with the 1993
British Lions in New Zealand, playing in the first Test.
3
PETER WRIGHT
(Boroughmuir)
Tight-head prop: Age 27, 6ft, 17st 2lbs, 7 caps.
Peter Wright is a footballing prop in the David Sole mould. He has
been in devastating form for his club this season where his strong
running off ruck and maul has been a feature of the Boroughmuir
game-plan. His ability to play and referee simultaneously marks him down
as an obvious candidate for the whistlers' ranks once he has hung up his
playing boots! Despite his prowess with ball in hand he is also a strong
scrummager and was a Lion in NZ in 1993.
4
DAMIAN CRONIN
(Bourges)
Lock: Age 31, 6ft 6ins, 17st 10lbs, 30 caps.
Damian Cronin has returned to the national side rejuvenated since his
decision to enlist with the French club Bourges. Ever present in the
Scotland side since his debut in 1988 -- and a member of the 1990 Grand
Slam side -- until his form slumped in 1994 but he clawed his way back
to national contention with some bravura displays for Scotland 'A' and
the Exiles. Crowned his comeback against Canada with a well-deserved
try.
5
STEWART CAMPBELL
(Dundee HSFP)
Lock: Age 22, 6ft 6ins, 16st 8lbs, one cap.
Stewart Campbell had a dream debut against the Canadians at
Murrayfield a fortnight ago when he and Damian Cronin ruled supreme on
the touchlines. He has played international rugby in three age-groups
and played for West of Scotland before his architectural studies took
him to Dundee. He has played three times for Scotland 'A' and toured
with Scotland in Argentina last summer.
6
ROB WAINWRIGHT
(West Hartlepool)
Flanker: Age 29, 6ft 4ins, 15st 4lbs, eight caps.
Rob Wainwright, an Army doctor, probably prefers to play at No.8 but
his versatility at international level has seen him enlisted in the role
of flanker, No.8 and as a replacement lock. He was named captain of the
Scotland tour party to Argentina last summer but was forced to withdraw
through injury. A Cambridge ''Blue'', he played a stormer in last
season's Calcutta Cup game, scoring a try, before sustaining a jaw
fracture.
7
IAIN MORRISON
(London Scottish)
Flanker: Age 32, 6ft 1in, 15st 1llbs, 7 caps.
Iain Morrison came late to senior international rugby after having
toured Zimbabwe with Scottish Schools in 1980 while a pupil at
Glenalmond. A Cambridge ''Blue'' in 1983 and 1984, he has played for
London Scottish since 1985 and was a member of their Middlesex winning
seven in 1991. He returned to the Scottish side against South Africa
after breaking a leg in the encounter with Wales in Cardiff last season.
8
ERIC PETERS
(Bath)
No.8: Age 26, 6ft 5ins, 16st 10lbs, one cap.
Eric Peters, born in Glasgow, made an impressive debut for Scotland
against the Canadians. After outings with England U21 and England
Students, he came to the notice of the Scottish selectors following
impressive outings in the District Championship with the Exiles. A
former captain of Cambridge University, he has played for Scottish
Select and Scotland 'A'. At Bath he is one of a galaxy of back-row stars
that is the envy of many national sides.
Replacements - Cameron Glasgow (Heriot's FP), Graham Shiel (Melrose),
Derrick Patterson (West Hartlepool), Shade Munro (GHK), Paul Burnell
(London Scottish), Kevin McKenzie (Stirling County).

WHEN the ''Electric Eel'' meets the ''Cheekie Chappie'' on wing patrol
this afternoon, the sparks are guaranteed to fly.
Simon Patrick Geoghegan, Ireland's all-action flier, will be making
the head to head acquaintance of Kenneth McKerrow Logan, by far the
liveliest of the Scotland backs this season, for the first time, and a
lifelong friendship may not be on the cards.
Geoghegan, who has switched to Bath this season after several years
with London Irish, works as a solicitor in London. From there he told me
how much he was looking forward to the Murrayfield encounter.
''I have played five times against Scotland so far and never won yet,
though I did score a try against them in 1991. My losing run must end
sometime -- this would be a grand occasion to do it.
''After our defeat against England this is a hugely important game for
us. We have to start winning in our build-up to the World Cup. And I
believe we will.''
Geoghegan, blond and with scorching pace, blazed onto the
international scene in 1991, winning his first cap against France that
year. He bagged three tries in the Five Nations' Championship and was
named Ireland's player of the year by his country's rugby writers.
He was considered somewhat unlucky to miss out on the British Lions'
tour of 1993, but remains the most potent attacking weapon in a green
jersey.
What, however, does he know of Logan?
''Not very much, he admitted, ''because I have only seen him on
television clips. But I hear he is in fine form and it should be a good
contest.''
Still only 22, Logan, a farmer, is four years younger than his rival
today, with much less international experience. Not that the Stirling
County winger, never short of a wisecrack, is likely to be overawed.
''I will try and get in his face early on,'' he declared. ''Make no
mistake, Simon is a world-class player. I like competing against guys
like him -- I enjoyed facing Ieuan Evans of Wales last season -- because
it helps me to be sharp.''
Kenny was first capped as a full back in Australia three years ago,
and there are those who believe he may eventually return to that
position. At the moment, however, he is happy disproving the myth that
he is not fast enough to be an international winger.
Against South Africa and Canada he carved chunks out of the defences
and was only just denied tries on both occasions. His style may be
slightly less frenetic than Geoghegan's, but you can sense the
excitement among the crowd as soon as he receives a pass.
''Playing against someone like Simon means you have to shut them down
quickly,'' says Logan. ''If he has the ball in his hands, he will only
be offered one way to go.
''Where I think I have an advantage is that I am almost a stone
heavier. I would like to believe I can use that weight to good effect.
Geoghegan insists there is no gloom in the Irish camp, though he is
particularly sorry that his close friend, full back Jim Staples, has
been ruled out through injury.
The lawyer and the farmer are going to their blocks. When the gun goes
off, the resultant fireworks are sure to light up the stadium.

IT'S ''le crunch'' time for England at Twickenham this afternoon, when
they line up against the much-hyped France side with it's back-row of
Philippe Benetton, Laurent Cabannes and Abdel Benazzi who, between them,
have amassed 87 caps.
It is this division within the French side that concerns the English
most. For instance, Jack Rowell, managing England for the first time in
a home Five Nations' match, has a sky-high regard for flanker Cabannes.
''He is a real danger and can magic scores out of nothing,'' said
Rowell.
Captain Will Carling, one of four players to have been involved in
England's run of seven victories over the French, added a cautious note:
''Our loose forwards will need to survive their hardest test if they are
to overcome a very unified French outfit in their specialist roles.''
However, Ben Clarke, England's answer to Cabannes on the open-side
flank, is looking forward to the match. ''Cabannes is a tremendous
player,'' said Clarke. ''All three were influential when France beat New
Zealand twice last summer.
''They have different skills and I only hope that we can use our own
complementary skills to match them.
''England are trying an expanding game with constant linking between
backs and forwards, and the French test will provide pressure and a
severe examination for me, Dean Richards, and Tim Rodber.
Clarke and his colleagues are happy to have the ball in their hands,
but their main aim is to create the positions for the likes of Jeremy
Guscott and the Underwood brothers.
Meanwhile, Guy Laporte the French team manager, has laughed off Brian
Moore's comparison of his side to 15 Eric Cantonas. The England hooker
has made a ritual of trying to wind up the French, his latest offering
being: ''Playing against France is like facing 15 Eric Cantonas -- they
are brilliant, but brutal.''
But Laporte, the former France fly-half, refused to be drawn into a
slanging match. ''The first time Brian Moore said something before a
match, it surprised everybody,'' said Laporte. ''But when you have heard
it for the tenth time, it is just amusing. He is spinning the same
record.
''We are here to play rugby. After the match we will see who the Eric
Cantonas are.'' Teams:
England -- M J Catt (Bath); T Underwood (Leicester), W D C Carling
(Harlequins), captain, J C Guscott (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); C R
Andrew (Wasps), K P P Bracken (Bristol); J Leonard (Harlequins), B C
Moore (Harlequins), V E Ubogu (Bath), M O Johnson (Leicester), M C
Bayfield (Northampton), T A K Rodber (Northampton), D Richards
(Leicester), B B Clarke (Bath).
France -- J-L Sadourny (Colomiers); P Bernat-Salles (Pau), P Sella
(Agen), T Lacroix (Dax), P Saint-Andre (Montferrand), captain; C Deylaud
(Toulouse), G Accoceberry (Begles); L Benezech (Racing CF), J-M Gonzalez
(Bayonne), C Califano (Toulouse), O Roumat (Dax), O Brouzet (Grenoble),
A Benazzi (Agen), L Cabannes (Racing CF), P Benetton (Agen).

ONE of the most interesting aspects of today's international should be
the duel at prop between Peter Wright and Nick Popplewell, and encounter
that JOHN BEATTIE thinks is one not to be missed.
LATER today, a good many eyes will be focused on the rehabilitation of
Peter Wright as prop celebre as he tangles with an old touring partner
and sparring mate, Irishman Nick Popplewell, who made the Test team in
Gavin Hastings' Lions.
Wright looks forward to the challenge. ''I've only played in the same
team against him, never in a game, but we scrummaged against each other
a lot in practice,'' says the Boroughmuir man. ''He is very like David
Sole, in that he comes into contact very dynamically, and then wants to
get out into the loose. It will be really hard, but that's what you'd
expect.''
The spies will tell you that Wright, the man who plays tight-head
today, and Paul Burnell, the man he replaced, had a dust-up on the
training pitch a week ago during scrummage practice.
Wright enjoyed it, telling Burnell that he had left it a little late
in his career to start swopping blows.
Scrummaging is a hidden secret. Memories, though, of the psychological
advantages in not creaking backwards on the first scrum of an
international are still fresh in my mind. If you're not on the pitch,
you don't know the kick you get from zonking the bastards back on the
first put-in.
Wright says that scrums in internationals are less onerous than those
in clubs. ''In internationals the scrums are shorter, the pitches are
better, and there isn't the wheeling and messing around, so they last
only for about three seconds. I think that the scrummaging against the
Irish will be important, but the game won't be won or lost in the
scrums.''
Yet he admits that the first few put-ins will be crucial. ''It's
important we don't go back, so what happens in these big games is, we
all try like bears in the first five or so scrums, and then we settle
down and it gets easier,'' he says. ''They have two No.8s in their
second row, so we expect them all to want to get out into the loose as
quickly as possible and attack us there. I feel comfortable about the
scrummaging -- I think we have a fairly good front row.''
It's a rejuvenated Wright who takes the pitch today. The blacksmith
has had an impressive season for his club, and is described by Jim
Telfer as ''one of the two most comfortable players in the pack with the
ball in hand.'' The other being Eric Peters.
''I've lost weight and become much fitter,'' he explains. ''I've come
down to 17st 4lb, and I'm enjoying it. I'm also enjoying the type of
rugby we are trying to play, which has far more continuity to it, rather
than just going down with the ball.''
Wright may say that he feels that the game will not be decided by
scrummaging, but the Irish bring with them an impressive front row, a
trio that played for the Barbarians in their win over the South
Africans, and they are unlikely to be overawed.
The duel between Wright, a man to seldom take a backward step --
unless it's to stand on someone -- and arguably Britain's best
loosehead, Popplewell, will be an event to savour.

LARGE Action just go up to win the Pat's Jester Hurdle at Kelso
yesterday, but his performance pleased trainer Simon Sherwood, who said
that his runner did all that was required of him.
Despite the narrowness of his victory, one leading bookmaker was
impressed enough to promote Large Action to 4-1 co-favourite with
Relkeel and Fortune and Fame for the Champion Hurdle next month.
Surrey Dancer led over the last but Large Action, who was giving 21lbs
to his seven rivals, ran on well up the fiishing hill to edged home in
the final strides. Sherwood, on his first visit to the Borders track,
was never in doubt. ''The course was a bit sharp for him,'' said
Sherwood, ''but the race was just what he wanted. It made him think a
bit.''
Coqui Lane and Daphnis set a fast pace, but Jamie Osborne, on the
winner, refused to panic and gradually made up ground to join Batabanoo
and Surrey Dancer when it mattered.
''I thought I would come off second best to Surrey Dancer,'' said the
rider, ''but halfway up the run-in I gave him four or five whacks and
that was it. I wouldn't swap him for any other in the champion hurdle.''

TRAINER Andy Turnell won the Grand National with outsider Maori
Venture, and he can spring another surprise at Sandown this afternoon
with Country Member in the Agfa Diamond Chase.
The selection has done well in top company, having won this race in
1993, beating Rushing Wild who went on to chase home Jodami in the Gold
Cup. Three times a course and distance winner, Country Member showed
more promise behind Raymylette last time and looks set for a return to
winning ways.
The following handicap hurdle should go to Allegation.
Martin Pipe's useful campaigner has been improving all season, winning
four times, and has been raised nearly two stones since October.
However, it will be a surprise if the champion trainer has not brought
him on for this test, and he should have too much pace for Burnt Imp.
High Baron can retain his unbeaten run over fences in the Scilly Isles
Chase.
Just short of top class as a hurdler, he appeared to lose his
enthusiasm for the smaller obstacles but zestful performances in his
three chases to date have dispelled doubts about his temperament, and he
should win this if he can put in a clear round.
Ex-French runner Banjo may have his jumping put under pressure over
this difficult course.
At Wetherby, Squire Silk looks the pick of the field for the Rievaulx
Hurdle. Although outgunned behind Atours in November, he is a
progressive sort who won four off the reel in the second half of last
season.
With the ground in his favour, he can capitalise on the 20lbs he is
conceded by Attadale.
Dual Image makes his debut over fences im the Helmsley Chase. The
change should suit this sturdy individual and he can reward early
support.
* HERALD racing expert White and Gold warmed up for the weekend action
by landing a 6[1/2]-1 double at Kelso yesterday.
He was convinced that Large Action (4-6) was the best bet of the day,
as so it proved. And he coupled this one with Clay County (7-2) to end
the day on a high note.

JODAMI is on course for an attempt at a hat trick of successes in the
tomorrow's Hennessy Gold Cup at Leopardstown.
Trainer Peter Beaumont has been concerned about the ground for his
1993 Gold Cup winner, who has come to grief in both his starts so far
this season, at Haydock and Wetherby, but all is now well.
And it is not surprising that Jodami is favourite for tomorrow's big
race. But another chaser with some salvage work to do on his reputation
is Merry Gale.
Jim Dreaper's seven-year-old was an impressive winner of the Durkan
Punchestown Chase but also has come to grief twice over fences this
season.
''The horse is in good form,'' said Dreaper, ''and although he'd be a
better horse on good ground, we're not too worried. At the moment, I
don't know whether he'll go to Cheltenham -- I want him to justify going
there.''
Martin Pipe's Chatam, beaten a short-head by Jodami in 1993 but a
well-beaten fourth last year, is the other British challenger for the
race, and he will have the help of Irish champion jockey Charlie Swan.
Leopardstown has been unable to race owing to waterlogging over the
last two weekends, but a spokesperson for the track said: ''The going on
both courses is heavy, but the forecast is good.

THE hunter-chasing season is under starter's orders this afternoon,
but it is unusual to have one of that code's stars in action so early in
the season.
But punters at Wetherby have have the pleasure of watching Teaplanter,
one of the best hunters for many seasons, in action, although success
for Robert Russell's mount is not exactly a foregone conclusion.
The problem is the time maybe catching him up, for at 12 years old he
could have seen his best days. However, it should be worth following
Teaplanter again, and do not be too surprised if Nick The Brief follows
him home.
Of course, it's always nice to start the way you mean to finish, with
a winner, and with this in mind, Amber Valley could be the one.
Neale Doughty has not been having it easy since his split from trainer
Gordon Richards, but the Welshman should be in the winner's circle
aboard High Altitude after the novices handicap chase.
Trainer Andy Turnell is not exactly a frequent visitor to the
Yorkshire track, and perhaps a wager on his Rustic Sunset in the novices
chase will not go amiss.
Local trainer Micky Hammond could take the feature hurdle race with
Daring Past who, with just 10st 4lb, should be good enough to show
Attadale the way home.
It is pointless starting well if you finish on a low note, but support
for Martin Brennan's mount Threeoutoffour could solve that problem in
the last.
* TODAY'S other scheduled fixture, at Chepstow, has been abandoned
because the track is waterlogged.

PIERRE Berbizier believes England and France can use today's Five
Nations Championship match at Twickenham as a springboard for World Cup
success in June if they throw away their inhibitions.
''If we want to challenge the southern hemisphere teams we have to
discard tight, tactical kicking games,'' the French coach claims.
''It's true that in the last six years England have been a lot more
intelligent than us but if we are both to rise to the challenge of the
southern hemisphere teams we have to throw caution to the wind,'' he
urged England.
He is hopeful of a positive response from England coach Jack Rowell
who has encouraged England to play a running, handling game since taking
over last year.
''England have showed they can adapt. Let's hope we can make this game
an occasion to remember. Defeat will not be important if we prove we are
on the right lines to challenge Australia, New Zealand and South
Africa,'' Berbizier said.
France have lost their last seven games to England and Berbizier
blames himself for not motivating his side enough last year.
''I do not think I will have the same problem this time,'' he said of
the press campaign which led to him dropping Olivier Merle for butting
Welsh prop Ricky Evans a fortnight ago.
He would not dwell on the incident but said: ''Olivier was rock solid
in the pack and allowed Laurent Cabannes to stand off.''
Berbezier has warned his team to concentrate on rugby basics.
''In the past we were unable to adapt our game against England. We
grew impatient and forgot the basics,'' Berbizier said. ''We have to
remember we cannot rely on French flair to pull us through.''
Centre Philippe Sella, winning his 104th cap against England, is the
only member of the current side to have won at Twickenham, in 1987.
Eight of the side will play at Twickenham for the first time.
But Berbizier does not believe it will be a handicap. ''In the last
couple of years we have won in Christchurch, Auckland and
Johannesburg,'' he pointed out.
There were slight injury doubts over flanker Abdelatif Benazzi who had
a sore rash on his left foot, and Toulouse right wing Emile N'Tamack who
missed his club match against Toulon on Sunday with a leg strain.
But Berbizier said: ''They should be alright.''

Patriotism may indeed be the last refuge of a scoundrel but it is a
quality which is not always to the forefront when international caps are
in the offing. The thorny subject is due for a further airing when the
International Board meets next month, as Chief Rugby Writer DEREK
DOUGLAS discovers.
BAREFACED cheek! There really is no other way to describe it. Careful
mind, but in the unlikely event that the opportunity arises, take a
close look at the erstwhile Welsh lock Tony Copsey's naked butt. There,
in all its technicolour and typographical glory, you will observe the
tattooed legend ''Made in England.''And, lest you find yourself making
the unwelcome acquaintance of the law as a result of conduct unbecoming
a rugby gent (or lady), your defence is that you are conducting research
into the bewildering and byzantine issue of international rugby union
qualification status.
Copsey, an Essex man who threw in his lot with Wales in 1992 after a
brief flirtation with the England Development Squad, is merely the most
colourful embodiment of a phenomenon which afflicts the game worldwide,
that of the talented player who wants to play international rugby and
who, mostly for pragmatic reasons (Cospey lived and studied in the
Principality), perms any one nationality from two or three.
Currently, and within the past five or so seasons, we have seen
Tongans (including Willie Offahengaue, who played for NZ schools and
toured Australia with New Zealand before visa problems barred his
return) in Aussie colours; a clutch of Western Samoans within All Black
ranks; a Moroccan and a Senegalese wearing the blue of France; an
Australian lining up alongside the the little men from the Land of the
Rising Sun; another Aussie enlisting with the Emerald Isle; an
Argentinian Wallaby; Nigerians drafted into the England camp and, even,
some would have us believe, ''Scotsmen'' whose grandmothers once knew a
man who scoffed porridge for breakfast!
Welcome to the crazy world of international rugby union which, by
comparison, often makes Jack Charlton's Republic of Ireland football
side look like a bunch of homegrown bhoys raised as babes in deepest
Dublin.
And now, as a result of mainly Antipodean iniatiatives, we have -- but
probably not for much longer -- the 12-month residency qualification
which turns the winning of international honours into a whole new ball
game. It has met with almost universal disapproval in the northern
hemisphere and is to come up for review at the IRFB annual meeting next
month.
In fact, so unloved is the 12-month rule that it will almost certainly
be destined for an early bath. At its interim council meeting in Canada
the IB agreed, subject to ratification at the Board agm, that the
previous recommended ruling of a three-year qualification period should
be reinstated.
Five months ago the Scottish Rugby Union experienced the collective
ire of the Scottish rugby community as a result of their temporary
dalliance with the new 12-month ruling.
The IRFB's current player qualification rules are clear enough. A
player may play for the country of his choice if he was born there; if a
parent or grandparent was born there; or, now, much more
controversially, if he has completed 12 consecutive months of residency
preceding the time of playing.
The SRU had never been favour of the new qualification in the first
place but decided that Scotland -- with its meagre player resources --
could not afford further to disadvantage itself in the face of rival,
primarily southern hemisphere, nations who adopted the residency ruling
with alacrity.
However, after widespread domestic opposition, the SRU showed that it
did not fear the prospect of a highly public U-turn and responded to
what its ''constituents'' were saying by reverting to the minimum
qualification of a Scots-born grandparent. And amen to that.
But what is the current position of the other Home unions? The RFU at
Twickenham is unequivocal. Secretary Dudley Wood says: ''We have nothing
laid down but we play only Englishmen -- British passport holders. Our
Nigerians have been here almost all of their lives -- they went to
school here -- and they consider themselves to be Englishmen.''
The RFU has proposed a four-year residency obligation in place of the
12-month rule currently in place. Wood adds:''With more rugby players
than Scotland, Ireland and Wales we are in a fortunate position but we
would also like to see the grandparent provision scrapped as well.''
Wood further underlined the potential absurdity of the nationality
question when he revealed that Brian Smith, an Australian international
and Oxford Blue who enlisted with Ireland in 1989 on the strength of a
Celtic grandparent, had tried -- first of all -- to join the England
camp.
''He phoned me and said that he wanted to play for England. I said
that he had no qualifications whatsoever and that it was impossible,''
says the RFU secretary.
Wales has historically suffered not only from an exodus of its playing
elite ''up north'' to rugby League, but has also experienced the galling
spectacle of a cadre of eligible ''Welshmen'' and sons of Welshmen
opting for England; Stuart Barnes, Gareth Chilcott and Dewi Morris
spring immediately to mind.
WRU media spokesman Rob Cole says: ''It has been annoying, to say the
least. We only have 17,500 senior players while England and France have
250,000. It's a bit of an unequal struggle. However, we're still strict
in our attitude as to who should play for Wales and we have a six-year
residency ruling.''
One ''Scot'' who has suffered as a result of the Welsh ruling is the
''New Zealander'' of Maori stock, Dale McIntosh. He plays his club rugby
in Wales for Pontypridd and was a Scottish trialist in 1993. He had
already played for Scotland A in 1991 and did so again, against Italy,
in 1993. Now McIntosh wants to enlist with the Welsh squad. He qualifies
under the six-year residency rule but falls foul of another regulation
which stipulates that he cannot be considered for Wales until three
years have elapsed from the last time that he played for Scotland 'A'.
Maybe his ''Scottish'' case would have been given more weight had he
opted to play his club rugby in Scotland.
The Irish are also opposed to the IB 12-month residency ruling and
operate a born in Ireland, parent/grandparent regulation.
Rugby administrator George Spotswood says: ''Our committee have agreed
that in addition to those criteria we should, if we wish, employ a
three-year residency rule. Anything else just gets silly. In Hong Kong,
for instance, you can qualify for their 'national' side almost as soon
as you step off the plane.
In Scotland, after last year's ''stushie'' when the SRU decided to
keep the one-year residency rule in the locker, just in case it was
needed, the status quo now prevails.
SRU chief executive Bill Hogg explains: ''The IB at its most recent
annual meeting changed the rules by bringing it down from three years to
one year. We weren't in favour of the three years and we certainly
weren't in favour of the one-year ruling. We were much against it but,
being a democratic body, we were outvoted and that was it.
''It has now been reconsidered in Canada and it has been agreed to
recommend to the Unions that it should be put back to three years.
Ireland already have a three-year rule.
''So at present in Scotland we don't have any residency
qualifications. Our qualifications are still purely birth, parents and
grandparents. After the IB agm it will be up to our committee to decide
how they feel about the three years if, indeed, it is passed but at
present we are still using the birth, parents and grandparents ruling.''
It is wrong, though, to give the impresion that all those who shoulder
their kit -- or carpet -- bags, and turn up from distant lands on the
doorstep of the Union of their choice are rugby-playing opportunists
with an eye on the main chance.
Take, as an example, Scotland's very own wandering star of recent
memory, Sean Lineen. When he won the first of his 29 caps, against Wales
in 1989, his selection did not meet with universal approval. There were
those within the domestic game who considered him a Sean-come-lately who
had thrown in his lot with Scotland -- by virtue of a Hebridean
grandfather -- only because he was not quite good enough to make the
highest grade in his native New Zealand.
Maybe, but Lineen, an affable man whose arrival represented a real
tonic to Scottish midfield play, went on to establish a world-record
centre partnership with Scott Hastings. And more importantly -- with a
Scottish wife and a burgeoning business career in the land of his
adoption -- he went on to demonstrate a genuine commitment to Scotland,
and not just in a rugby sense.
Those who deliver the habitual, horrified knee-jerk reaction to the
appearance of incomers and outsiders in a Scotland jersey should
remember the example set by Lineen. International rugby players aren't
all patriots but scoundrels are pretty scarce as well.

IT IS THE twinkle in the eyes that gives him away. The words can be
outrageous, even intimidating, but it is best, before you allow the
hairs on your neck to rise, to take a close look at the eyes. Not even
Ivan Golac can turn off their sparkle when he is keeping a straight face
and letting loose the pearls which have so often upset managers and
fans, maybe even his own board room, since this engaging Croatian landed
at Tannadice 18 months ago.
It is impossible to dismiss the impression that Golac has spent much
of that time laughing at us all, chortling merrily at the amount of
discomfort, fury and disbelief his radical style of management has
engendered. He does not regret one minute of his stay, either, and I
suspect, given the chance, he would willingly have a go at achieving
greater glory for Dundee United beyond this season when his contract
ends.
It seems a certainty, however, that Ivan will be packing his bags and
heading somewhere else, where his combination of talent and impish sense
of fun will no doubt startle another collection of hard-bitten league of
football aficionados.
He refuses to say anything about his intentions, other than to confess
that he and his family have discussed plans for the next few years. ''I
have always done that, even when I was a player. We like to plan what we
want to do for maybe three years ahead . But there are four months to go
before we need to think about that.'' He is not ambiguous at all about
his desire to stay in Scotland. ''I love it here, the place, the people,
and I am sure I can do lots of things for the game.''
He considers winning the Scottish Cup as one of his finest
achievements. ''It is one of the oldest trophies in the world and
winning it gave me a very special feeling. The emotion of that day did
get to me, I have to admit.''
He does not accept that the inconsistency of the team since that great
afternoon in May is an illustration of failings. ''Not at all. There is
much more to follow from Dundee United. I am sure of that. We won the
cup, were in the semi-final of the League Cup, and finished middle of
the table. That was not bad for one season. The squad was missing a lot
of players at the start of this season because of injury. Maybe Rangers
can do without some key players, or Manchester United, but we are not in
that position.''
The only real disappointment he would admit to is the defeat in the
European Cup-winners' Cup in which he feels his team could have done
well, if all the players had been available.
It is difficult to persuade Golac to dwell on such low moments. His
mind seems to use disappointments like trampolines to propel himself
into more amenable territory, but he did permit a moment or two to talk
about the tribulations of recent months. The queue of players going to
the League to appeal against fines, threatening court action, protesting
about contracts, and wanting away cannot have made life easy for the
manager.
But he disagrees. ''It did not really upset me. My philosophy as a
manager is that you want players who are happy. They have to love their
job and it looks to me as if football does not mean as much to some of
the boys as it does to me. I still love it and I still like to win.'' He
then verbally sprints off into his favourite territory. ''After all, I
am only 44 and I have decided to retire from head tennis. I am the
undisputed champ.
''Of course,'' he says, coming back to the main track again, ''it is
disappointing. You try to help them in every sense, with advice on and
off the park. Obviously some are not able to take advice and that is
sad.
''Football is a very short life and you have to try get the best out
of it for your wife and family. If you don't there is something wrong
with you. When I see the way some players think it is very strange for
me.
''You see, if you ask 1000 boys what they would like to be, 99% would
say footballers. I always planned to be able to live outside football
when I was finished and I find it disappointing that some of these lads
are not taking advantage of being footballers and doing the same. There
are 101 things you can do alongside playing football to plan security
for the future.''
In saying that, Golac perhaps reveals one of the reasons he copes so
well with the pressures of an occupation which has overwhelmed others.
He is a man of independent means, with land and business interests back
in what was Yugoslavia.
But it would be wrong to imagine that this most civilised of men has
treated Dundee United as a kind of part-time hobby with which to enjoy
himself. That would be a long distance from the truth. He takes the
business very seriously indeed, but sees no reason why it cannot still
be fun. He also has the requisite passion for winning and is just as
serious when he says he hates losing as much as his peers. But his
philosophy when he came to Scotland has remained unaltered.
''I think I found from the start that people were too negative in this
country, everyone. Obviously, it is tough and hard for managers but I
don't see the sense in looking for an alibi.
''There are managers who have said to me privately 'I wish I could get
away with some of things you say.' But that is very sad. The game needs
characters. It is easy to be dull and say the same old things.''
He has never been accused of either, and believes football should be
prepared to let in a little of the showbiz mentality to its Calvinistic
corridors. He has infuriated Rangers fans by saying his team would beat
them 4-0. He startled his peers by saying his team would win the league
and cup in his first season.
One of his most eccentric habits is to come into a press conference
after his team lose with a smile on his face -- ''It puts you off,
doesn't it?'' The man does not reserve his fun for discussions with the
Fourth Estate. He once walked into the dressing room before a game with
Motherwell and shouted to 21-year-old Christian Dailly to pick the team.
Then he walked out.
He does not mind having his words thrown back at him, either. ''If I
say we'll beat Rangers so what if I am wrong? How many teams beat them
anyway? If I say it will be a hard game, that is not very exciting is
it?'' He sincerely believes that press relations are part of what he
calls the art of management. ''Coaching is one side of it, too, but
motivating the players, knowing each of them and their little ways is
another.''
Golac is proud of the fact his team did, in fact, beat Rangers 3-0 at
Ibrox, the first side to do so for six years. He also offers a typically
lateral view of his team's 5-0 defeat by Hibs in the first game of this
season. ''It is better losing one game 5-0 than five games 1-0.'' He's
right, when you think about it.
He is convinced, naturally, that his club will do well in defence of
the cup. ''We will have a good run in the cup, until 4.45 on May 27.''
That, of course, is cup final day.
What of his future? Let Ivan tell you in his own words. ''I will
retire from club management in 14 years, when I am 59. I will then
manage a national side for five years and then maybe I will be a
director for a while.''
There was a twinkle in his eye. I think.

DESPITE an international growth promoted by achieving full Olympic
medal status and a flourishing World Cup circuit this season -- which is
challenging Alpine racing's equivalent for media coverage in Europe --
Scotland, by comparison, remains a quiet backwater for competitive
free-style skiing.
There are three disciplines -- ballet, aerials, and moguls. The
last-named involves skiing over bumps spectacularly fast, down the fall
line, and performing two jumps during the run, without losing line or
rhythm. Britain's director of free-style skiing, Jonathon Bayntun,
believes that Scotland should be providing more young British team
skiers for moguls.
Mogul competition, which reached full Olympic medal status in
Albertville, France, in 1992, should be big and high profile on the
Scottish slopes, according to Bayntun.
''If Scotland wants to see free-style take off and match the growth
rates of France, America, and Canada, then it has to be event-driven.
The facilities are available to run good-quality mogul competitions on
Scottish slopes and, as was proven last year with a very successful
event on Cairngorm, there is the interest from competitors and most
importantly, spectators.
''Last year it was proven again that skiers would stop and watch, and
enjoy the action. That should be the catalyst for the growth of mogul
competition in Scotland. If we could have a circuit running with an
event every two weeks, then we would start to see many more young skiers
getting involved and ultimately wanting to compete at a higher level.
Only then will we start to see real numbers of Scottish mogul skiers
challenging for British team places.''
As it stands the Scottish free-style team's A squad operate virtually
autonomously from the Scottish National Ski Council for no other reason
than that the SNSC, who face similar funding cutbacks to the British Ski
Federation, cannot provide them with any resources.
Typical of the few emerging Scots is 24-year-old Julie Gall, who has
been skiing moguls competitively for only two years but last month was
invited to take up an allocation of home-nation places in the World Cup
event in Breckenridge, USA, and finished an excellent thirtieth.
More significantly, she earned the right to compete in future World
Cup events. Gall has been based in North America or Europe since 1989,
and must continue to meet the annual competition and training costs in
excess of #10,000 if she is to reach her goal of the 1998 Olympic Winter
Games. With a home-based circuit at grass-roots level, Bayntun contends,
there would be many more young skiers to boost this division of
competitive skiing to a level more comparable with Europe and America.
The Scottish National Ski Council's Douglas Bryce maintains: ''We have
programmes for a circuit of two-day mogul events in place, which would
offer one day's coaching and one day of competition at various Scottish
resorts. Willingness and commitment have been expressed but, like many
other areas, we just cannot get the sponsorship or funding to get it
moving.''

There's a rude awakening for Deirdre Chapman as she encounters global
amnesia
A FUNNY thing happened to me on the way back from somewhere. I lost my
memory. Wakening in hospital with no recollection of how I'd got there,
I first attempted to reorientate by the cunning expedient of trying --
and failing -- to read the embroidered logo on the folkweave curtains of
the Western Infirmary's acute stroke ward.
Presently there were voices off. Patients were wakening and asking the
nurses if they'd had a good night. So wherever I'd been I knew I was
back in Glasgow.
After that I just relaxed and hallucinated. Bare snow-capped mountain
ranges passed beneath me. Iran, I thought. A desert with a palace and a
mosque. Sharjah. Santa Claus in a huge empty air terminal. Singapore.
The phrase ''Christmas shopping across the globe'' kept bobbing about on
the top of my subconscious like a lager can in a gutter. I saw myself
buying a sarong in the airport at Cairns and, somewhere else, in a
moment freeze-framed and fragrant with yak butter and a hint of wind
chimes, a Tibetan prayer wheel for my son.
The blanked-out mind is verbal, unselective, and dazzled by novelty
and display. Or mine is. I played with the Tibetan prayer wheel for ages
before I spotted the flicker of light I had just called up behind it, a
veritable charcoal burner's hut in the trackless forest. I had a son.
Three sons. Hallelujah. Names and events began to heap up messily all
over the place, and by the time the doctors arrived on their morning
round I had embarked on The Quest For The Visa Card Receipt, being part
two of The Tale of The Ear-ring.
Obscured by my snowy counterpane I had discovered a bedside treasure
chest and deep within it a calfskin bag. In the bag, a voice was
prompting me, I should find a tiny drawstring purse containing African
trade bead ear-rings, a present for the maiden beloved of my middle son,
which, by their magical existence, would prove I had indeed been out
there, where the wild things are, not actually in Africa or Tibet, but
in the Oceanic Arts outlet in the duty-free shopping zone at Auckland
Airport.
This is global amnesia, an acute and fortunately temporary
complication of travel fatigue, developed by Franz Kafka from an
original idea of the Brothers Grimm with sets by Maurice Sendak. The
brain, appalled by the speed of modern travel, puts its hands over its
ears and will have no more. It is the short-term memory that packs in.
The doctor checked out the likely diagnosis by giving me a three-digit
number to retain and repeat. I couldn't. Worse, I made one up. The base
cunning that lies beneath the social veneer has been a revelation. But I
remembered my phone number, and after scans and X-rays to eliminate a
stroke, called home and summoned my family to the bedside to fill me in.
They had picked me up at Glasgow Airport from a London flight
following a 31-hour trip from New Zealand, which had come at the end of
a day's touring that itself included a helicopter trip and an internal
flight.
I was apparently quite rational until I began to repeat my traveller's
tales on a two-minute cycle. Then I asked if I'd been away somewhere.
They stood a couple of hours of this before they phoned the emergency
doctor. A long sleep finally straightened me out, though it took a
fortnight to reset my body clock, and about 12 hours of my life are
still missing from leaving Gatwick to wakening in hospital.
The Traveller's Handbook produced by the travel firm Wexas has a
chapter on travel fatigue and jet lag by travel medic Dr Richard Dawood
that collates various pioneering attempts to pacify the body whose
24-hour (in fact, 25-hour) cycle has been thrown out. To speed
adjustment to a different time zone there are several suggestions. Small
evening doses of melatonin (the natural hormone secreted by the pineal
gland as a response to the approach of night and available in the US as
a food supplement) are thought to be helpful. At Harvard, research is
being done on controlled light exposure. Aromatherapy offers several
remedies, and the homeopathic Arnica 6 is recommended by tour operators
Abercrombie and Kent.
A well-timed short-acting in-flight sleeping pill is the preferred
method of many frequent long-haul travellers for lessening travel
fatigue, but this, combined with alcohol, is thought to have caused a
rash of short-term amnesia cases in the late eighties. (I had neither
pills nor alcohol.)
In the end I think we have to admire the independence of the
maltreated brain. It is cool to treat travel as banal, to blank out
behind eyeshades and earplugs and think only of the destination. For the
business traveller it's probably essential.
The uncool sensate traveller, on the other hand, who chooses the
window seat, and keeps a map open on the knee, who doesn't sleep and who
counts surreal night-time refuelling stops in faraway places and a dawn
descent into the United Arab Emirates as high points of the trip, has
little chance of a quiet mind. Travel is and should be mind-blowing.

''I PREFER writing to running -- it's easier.'' Thus spake Solomon,
and who are we, perspiring even on the finger-exercise-only side of the
keyboard, to deny such wisdom.
The Solomon in question is Wariso, trying today to win the 200 metres
title at the AAA indoor championships in Birmingham, and to regain the
British international status which he forfeited last summer in the
doping laboratory.
The Londoner has already taken the first steps towards rehabilitation,
claiming the Scottish 200m crown at the Kelvin Hall last month. That
earned him a guest run against Russia last Saturday, but he wants full
salvation -- an international return which could come next weekend in
Glasgow against France.
The stigma of Wariso's offence was the red nose of the clown, rather
than the red cheeks of the cheat. The tablets which he took -- Up Your
Gas -- contained mahuang, Chinese ephedra. Nobody could credit that a
graduate in biotechnology, who had read all the ingredients, could be
daft enough to swallow the pills.
Least of all the British Athletic Federation chairman, Professor Peter
Radford: ''Even looking at the pill box evoked memories of the Old West,
of quacks pedalling potions guaranteed to revive one's sex life or
prolong life beyond 100.''
Just one pill -- and the identity of the two senior Olympic athletes
who gave them to Wariso remains a carefully protected secret -- was
enough to interrupt his career, the three-month suspension reserved for
minor miscreants, as opposed to the four years for real cheats: the
steroid and hormone transgressors.
Most, knowing his dilettante approach to training, bet he would not
return. After all, he used to hide, because he did not like hard work.
But Wariso, in his first major interview since his fall from grace,
revealed himself to be considerably more than a naive buffoon. In fact,
he confirmed that he has so much more going for him than athletics, that
the biggest surprise is that he was not lured from the comeback trail by
his other burgeoning talents.
Several members of Britain's athletics team are from ghettos like
Brixton and Handsworth. But not Wariso. He was brought up in the
middle-class comfort of Islington, son of a Nigerian mother and
Italian-Nigerian father, a social worker and a Royal Navy man.
He went to prep school, St Aloysius' in Highgate, then Finchley
Catholic High School. Despite his degree from University College London,
he admits to being an under-achiever. His sister has an MBA, and is
married to a stockbroker. His brother has a business and economics
degree and owns his own garage.
''I might have been a doctor if I'd applied myself more,'' confessed
Solomon. ''I really do believe I can do anything. Yes, I'm pretty laid
back about my sport, because unlike some, I know that if I don't run, I
can still eat.
''You have to get life in perspective. Like my suspension. Yes, I was
stupid. I broke the athletics rules, but nobody was killed. I speak
several languages. Unfortunately, Chinese isn't one of them.''
Backed by eight O grades, and A levels in physics, chemistry, and
biology, he writes science fiction and screenplays, and is working on a
novel. He freelances for magazines. He has written for the Daily Mirror,
FHM, and Sky magazine. He has broadcast for Radio Five, and TV, and one
piece of his work is bound for the Cannes Film Festival.
''Jeremy Bolt, at Impact Pictures, read my screeplays and loved them,
but said the special effects would bankrupt the film industry.''
Certainly, his denouement for one script, in which terrorists explode a
nuclear bomb in central London, sounds a touch costly.
He sparks off ideas in eugenics, parallel earths, and space
colonisation in less time than it takes to run 200 metres. ''My friends
think I must be on acid tablets,'' he confided.
I didn't dare ask. . .
''I always knew I'd be good at something,'' he said. But he remains
uncertain whether ''something'' should be athletics. ''I used to go to
training, touch my toes, then run home.'' He was not joking. His former
coach, John Isaacs, mentor to John Regis, was driven to distraction. But
several shrewd judges labelled Wariso as the next Linford Christie.
Among them was former promotions officer Andy Norman. ''Where's that
Wariso,'' he would yell on training nights. Wariso would be hiding,
playing brag, as likely as not, according to cronies.
But a horrific catalogue of injuries, including a bilateral hernia and
spinal scoliosis, genuinely conspired to halt his progress. His
salvation was #800 given him by Norman. ''The problems were
career-threatening,'' he said. ''Andy told me to get my body sorted. I
did, and afterwards felt an obligation to stop messing about.''
Since serving his suspension, he has already run faster than ever
before.
Beneath the flippant intellectualism one detects a sensitive man. He
has a collection of 20,000 comics, including some worth several thousand
pounds, but manages to make his dreams sound more than fantasy. ''I read
four papers a day. I like to know what is going on in the real world. I
have a friend who was in Ruanda last year. He's seen things he will
carry to his grave.
''Alongside that, my Helsinki experience was nothing. Yes, I really do
believe I would have won a medal. But I still believe I can get to an
Olympic and world final. And if I don't win an Olympic medal, I'll
probably write super screenplays, and win an Academy Award.''

What happens when our lot and their lot get together at Richmond?
JAMES MCKILLOP describes a recent dress-rehearsal containing everything
we want to see on today's big stage. He also looks at London Irish and
Scottish -- in good and bad times.
IN the context of the day the Irishman in the Davy Crockett raccoon
hat and emerald green scarf did not look out of place. Not for one
minute. After all, our lot were equally resplendent in Balmorals,
Glengarries, and tartan scarves and they certainly didn't look out of
place in and around Richmond.
It had been a satisfying day out for would-be frontiersman Seamus
O'Brian. He had witnessed an exceptional match and was now fully intent
on celebrating with auld friends and aquaintances. ''Sure, a Guinness
would go down quite nicely, thank you very much.''
By contrast, the guys with the slightly less melodic tones who had
earlier advised ''Come oan, aff yer backsides, Scottish, and get stuck
intae them,'' were by now in full moan over how the referee had allowed
the opposition to encroach offside time and time again without penalty.
''It's usually us that gets the blame for doing that,'' they huffed.
In the home dressing room looks were dire. Shoulders had fallen, so
much so that chins were almost touching the ground. There could be no
consoling captain Paul Burnell, the hardened Scotland international prop
forward, but omitted from the team to play Ireland. Nor was there the
slightest consolation for fly-half Murray Walker for his achievement in
kicking all of the home team's points.
''It's just no' fair,'' was the general mood in the Scottish camp.
(Have we heard this somewhere before?).
This had been the clash of the exiles, and as usual the match had
lived up to expectations. It was the mini-festival in preparation for
today's main event. It was London Scottish v. London Irish at the
Athletic Ground in Richmond a couple of days after Hogmanay.
The dress-rehearsal had everything we want to see on the big stage
today. Everything, that is, but for two magnificent Irish tries and a
scoreline that read London Scottish 15, London Irish 27.
The game had passion; raw brute force up front; fast, hard, and
intuitive rucking; support from all quarters; some excellent line-out
possession, albeit the occasional naive lapse in defence; a game that
moved from end to end at the blink of an eye with a scoreboard
constantly on the move; magnificent goal kicking on both sides; one team
taking the lead, then the opposition; a referee who was prepared to let
it all flow; and -- most of all -- it was played in the best of spirit.
Afterwards everyone who had taken part was worn out. Participants had
run their legs into the ground. Two ancient and respected teams
contested this latest battle of a war that had begun almost 100 years
ago.
For the few neutrals present it was one of the best games of rugby
they had seen in many a year. For me, it brought home to mind the
oft-repeated regret of former England flanker Mick Skinner that because
of an accident of birth he was never ever able to play in a
Scotland-Ireland match. Had he been allowed to do so, he wouldn't have
cared which side he was on.
''Scotland and Irish games are my kind of matches,'' he never tires of
saying. ''I just wish I could have taken part, even if only the once.''
Just as today's game should prove, the match between the exiles was
hugely competitive. Every tackle was crucial, every loose ball fought
for. Both teams are currently playing in the English Courage second
league, but neither consider themselves second division.
However, like many famous teams, they have suffered under league
footall. They want to be in there with the Baths, the Leicesters, the
Wasps, the Bristols, and the Harlequins, but are finding the going
tough.
Irish do have hopes of building up a team that will win promotion to
the English first division. Scottish, on the other hand, are facing the
prospect of demotion to the third.
Hence the jubilation in the Irish dressing room following the clash of
the exiles and the despondency among Scottish.
Perhaps it was this blue mood that persuaded much of the green support
to switch to Molly Malone's public house nearby in Kew Road to continue
the crack and why many Scots chose to drown their sorrows with a few
quick haufs, before going home to see if lottery numbers had come up.
But the truly hardened Scots who lingered on in the club lounge soon
began to perk up. ''Who cares?'' they concluded. ''It will be turned
round at Murrayfield!''
Scots paranoia
SCOTS who live and work in England have no doubt that they are
privileged to be Scottish, possibly even more so than kin back home.
However, there are certain drawbacks. Along with the pride, most of us
tend to suffer from more than a touch of paranoia.
Those who enjoy their rugby at the Athletic Ground, Richmond, are no
exceptions. Who can blame them? After all, over the years they have had
to learn to live with sniping not only from the English enemy but also
with many a broadside from friends north of the Border.
* In England rugby followers every so often question whether or not
exile teams, in particular London Scottish, should be allowed to play in
the Courage leagues.
* In Scotland now and again someone raises the question of whether or
not there should be a restriction on the number of exiles allowed to
play in the national team.
Hence an entertaining snippet from a recent London Scottish programme.
The author's main purpose was to congratulate the Scottish Exiles -- the
team had included a large contingent from London Scottish -- on winning
the District Championship for the first time.
However, he went on: ''As you would expect, the success of the Exiles
was greeted by the Scottish rugby media with all the warm-hearted
generosity and absence of myopic nationalism that we have come to
expect.
''Presumably these same writers will only be too happy when they have
gained their wish that nobody plays for Scotland who does not (a) have
two parents who have never left Scotland in their lives and, (b) has
never played for anyone other than a Scottish Rugby club and has an
accent like Billy Connolly.
''If they ever get their wish then we can look forward to such
thrilling encounters in future as Scotland v. Holland or Scotland v.
Latvia.''
Oh yes, we all have thin skins down in London. Still, if we are not
happy about taking it from our ain folk, we are even less likely to take
it lying down from the enemy.
Legend insists it all began with a joke in the Athletic Ground bar
after a particularly hard-fought match. Over a pint Alastair McHarg was
asked how he felt about London Scottish playing in the Courage League.
While the former line-out specialist nowadays professes innocence, he is
alleged to have riposted: ''Well, at least we are keeping one of these
English teams out.''
All very lighthearted and mildly amusing, but the remark was overheard
by an English sports journalist. His subsequent column was to open a
national debate on the propriety of the RFU permitting the enemy to play
against the leading English teams.
Not only were London Scottish keeping out a home team, but by
permitting the exiles to play against the best in England the Celtic
hordes were being given a privileged insight into English coaching
methods and tactics.
This, it was argued, could prove to be to England's detriment at some
future international. Well it's all a bit silly, isn't it? Yet every so
often such questions are raised north and south of the Border. It is
something Cameron Boyle, the hospitable president of London Scottish,
has learned to live with. He accepts that these issues will be raised.
It is unthinkable that London Scottish, founded in 1878, will not
continue to be in the forefront of British rugby. Throughout its famous
history the club has taken on the best England has had to offer and,
more often than not, has come out on top.
Currently they are struggling to avoid relegatation from the second to
the third. Scottish have had their bad seasons, but have always bounced
back. ''I am sure the same thing will happen again,'' says Cameron
Boyle.''What we really need is just a few more bigger players. Our
current problems aren't that much different from those of the national
team.''
Irish clearout
NEVER underestimate the Irish. If that is true of the national team,
then it applies equally to London Irish.
It was the last league match of last season about 90 minutes before
the team was due to take the field against all-conquering Bath when the
controversial coach, the former All Black hooker Hika Reid, was faced by
an unprecedented player revolt and walkout.
He had decided that winger Simon Geoghegan, the toast of all Ireland
after scoring a try against England at Twickenham, would not be selected
even though he had declared himself fit after a toe injury. It was to
have been Simon's last game for London Irish before joining Bath this
season.
With kick-off looming, the New Zealander was faced with an ultimatum
from Geoghegan's fellow Irish internationalists, full back Jim Staples
and tighthead prop Gary Halpin: ''If Simon doesn't play then we don't
play either!''
That is exactly what happened. It caused a furore throughout London
and beyond that would not die down. At the subsequent annual meeting
there was a full clearout -- from the president, Dr Hugh Condon,
downwards. Hika Reid, who would have stayed on for a further year if
permitted, was replaced by former Leicester and England centre Clive
Woodward.
The events were surely unprecedented in club history. Not only had
there been a complete change in the committee and coaching staff but the
club had also lost several key international players, not least Simon
Geoghegan. Worse still, after three years in the first division of the
Courage League, Irish were demoted to the second division.
Morale could not have been lower. Whereas lesser clubs might have been
expected to sink deeper into the morass, however, this year London Irish
have rallied behind their new coach as well as the policy of the new
committee to consolidate, then return to the first division as soon as
possible.
''There is no other place to be,'' I was told. ''It takes #350,000 a
year to run a club like Irish and you can only hope to keep the money
coming in from membership fees, the gates, and major sponsors if you are
playing against the Baths, Leicesters, Harlequins, and Wasps of this
world.'' Moreover, it is the best way of ensuring you attract and keep
the top players.''
The new set-up has meant that Jim Staples and Gary Halpin felt able to
stay with the club and there is an unqestionable air of expectancy about
the team on and off the field.
Perhaps it was bad luck on the Irish that they were relegated during
the year it was decided that, because of commitments on English
international players resulting from the World Cup, only one team would
go down from the first division and only one come up from the second.
It was also, perhaps, hard luck that Saracens should choose to play
magnificent rugby this season to head league two. Any hope Irish had of
immediately rejoining the elite evaporated last month when they lost at
home to the league leaders.
Now the club can only consolidate and look forward to next year. Every
club in Ireland has been approached and told that any player with
expectation of playing representative football -- at any level -- who is
moving to London or the South-East of England should be considering only
one club.
London Irish believe that the policy has the support not only of Irish
clubs but also the selectors, who are regular visitors to
Sunbury-on-Thames.True to form, the Irish refuse to stay despondent. The
are determined that, when they celebrate their centenary in 1998, the
club will not only be back in division one with a large quota of
inernational players in their squad, but they will be up there fighting
with the top five.

THE Scottish National Party yesterday announced the establishment of
an independent Land Commission to examine all aspects of the land issue
in Scotland, and to recommend how public policy on this resource can
best be managed.
The Commission is to be chaired by Professor Allan Macinnes, head of
the history and economic history department at Aberdeen University, and
its proposals should be published in late autumn.
Announcing the move Mrs Margaret Ewing, Parliamentary Leader of the
SNP, said: ''This Land Commission is a very important initiative for the
Scottish National Party but its key strength is that it will work and
report completely independently of the SNP.
''The Commission's membership is based upon people who are actively
involved in or commenting on the land issue and is independent of party
political allegiance.
''Historically the land issue has been very close to Scots' hearts --
both in rural and urban Scotland. From folk memories of the Clearances
to the current problems over access, land is quite rightly an emotive
issue in Scotland.''
Professor Macinnes said the commission will investigate and report on
all issues concerning the land of Scotland and make recommendations on
how public policy concerning the resource can be best managed for the
benefit of the people of Scotland.
The Commission's members are: Professor Macinnes; Mr Stephen Noon
(Clerk); Mr Donald Ferguson, solicitor, Portree (legal adviser); Mr
Douglas MacMillan, Aberdeen-based economist specialising in
environmental economics and forestry; Mr Ron Greer, environmental
consultant and founder of the  Glen Garry Tree Project; Dr Ian Parker,
hill farmer, Wigtownshire, currently exporting new agricultural methods
to Russian; and Ms Dot Jessiman, crofter in New Deer, Aberdeenshire.

Picking up on the trend set by BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance to
justify his earnings of #1816 a day, George Hume details a day in the
life of an ageing freelance hack
06.30am: Leave comfort of bed, prime coffee machine for heavy day
ahead, take in The Herald and window envelopes.
06.40am: Set off for work by foot, reading The Herald headlines en
route.
06.40am and 20 seconds: Arrive at desk, switch on word processor, feed
office cat (this being a lean, mean, honed-to-the-bone-operation Puss,
it doubles as a house cat), read contents of window envelopes, and, in
the absence of a crew from Sky TV to interview me about crass remarks
made the day before, resolve to accede to bank manager's request to
phone him for a chat just as soon as he is open for business.
07.00am: Spend five minutes rejoicing that, thanks to a recent
Government intervention, I am, as a freelance, no longer unemployed at
the start of every day but have the status of a job-seeker.
07.06am: The equivalent of Japanese corporate calisthenics completed,
I get on with the task of getting as near to Sir Iain's daily #1816 as
possible, seeking work in the hope that it can be found. Is there
someone out there who needs a gripping thousand words on the state of
the rice crop in Chad, a market for peppy prose on Sir Iain's #50,000 a
year for one and a half days a month as a top people's salary assessor
with the Royal Bank of Scotland? Plan sales campaign for day and work
out that when Sir Iain is working for the bank he takes home #2777 a
day. Refer to dictionary for definition of greed.
09.00am: Murmur sweet nothings to bolster ego of resident feline, have
first coffee-break of day, switch on Radio Four and yet again wonder if
phone-in contributors from Deep South are for real, scan columns of The
Herald, try to get to grips with concept of BT being world class and
spare a thought for Sir Iain hacking it against all the odds.
09.30am: Dial number of bank manager to hear things about myself of
which I was hitherto unaware and am told by recorded BT voice -- Lady
Vallance on a pin-money jag, perhaps? -- ''Sorry, the number you have
dialled has not been recognised.'' It is a conversation I know I will
have many times during the day -- her statement recorded, my reply unfit
to be recorded.
09.45am: Check front of house to see if Press Association reporter may
be loitering with intent -- anxious to note my views on the hours of
junior hospital doctors. All clear. Use next 15 minutes instead to refer
to freelance rate card in top drawer of desk: have I been invoicing for
past few years with decimal point in wrong place? No joy -- the groat
and the Pound Scots are still the common currency of the freelance
world.
10.00am: Grate cheese for working lunch in kitchen and search trouser
pockets in vain for wads of fivers before bunging breeks in washing
machine.
10.20am: Take call from bank manager who refuses to discuss details of
top people's salaries in his organisation after Sir Iain's intercession.
Is he making ends meet?
10.40am: Come off phone from bank manager with much to occupy my mind.
10.41am to 03.00pm: Mind occupied.
03.01pm to 04.00pm: Call colleagues and associates in Leith.
04.01pm: Remember business lunch and take cheese sandwich at desk.
Have another exchange with Lady Vallance.
04.15pm to 06.00pm: Re-read The Herald, take and make telephone calls,
take advice, make decisions.
06.01pm: Review the day and plan for tomorrow, check speeches I will
make as a job-seeker, and work out witty riposte to Lady Vallance.
07.30pm: Reassure cat of Sir Iain's ability to survive the slings and
arrows of outrageous good fortune and set off for armchair and a good
book.
07.30pm and 20 seconds: Arrive at armchair and good book. Settle down
for evening and wonder what kind of relaxing day the nation's junior
hospital doctors have been having.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang offered a glimmer of hope to the backers
of the move to re-open the Galloway Creamery last night when he spoke of
his personal desire to see a successful outcome to the creamery's
problems.
Representatives of the successful bidders for the operation have been
in talks with the Scottish Office Industry Department seeking a
grant-aid package under Regional assistance scheme.
Mr Lang said that because of commercial confidentiality he could not
comment on the details of the case. However, he assured his farming
audience at the Wigtownshire and Ayrshire Cattle Club annual dinner in
Stranraer: ''I am ensuring that all possible co-operation and assistance
is afforded within the rules of the schemes we operate.''
The Glasgow-based cheese distributor A McClelland is the preferred
bidder for the plant in partnership with the Farmers Creamery
Co-operative who are now trying to raise a further #500,000 in support
of their bid.
Mr Lang said that the closure of the Galloway Cheese Company plant in
Stranraer had been ''very regrettable'' and was due to the ''particular
commercial circumstances of that company.''
Having raised #750,000 in their initial appeal to the Scottish farming
community the members of the farmers co-operative are now asking their
supporters to contribute a further #500,000 and say that money has begun
to flow in. Before its closure the Galloway plant employed 130 people.
It is expected that a decision on the grant-aid applications will be
made next week when officials at the Scottish Office consider the case
submitted by the bidders. If the necessary level of support is not
forthcoming from the Scottish Office the whole rescue operation could be
placed in jeopardy. Some observers take the view that the possibility of
a successful re-opening is no more than 50-50.
A crucial factor would be the impact which a re-opening might have on
existing creameries. The government might see little point in backing
the re-opening of Galloway if that were to point to the possible closure
of Scottish Pride plants in Campbeltown and Bute.
Mr Lang said that the Scottish Office Agriculture Department was aware
of the problems which stemmed from the collapse of the export market for
young calves. The government was looking at ways of increasing
welfare-friendly veal production in Britain. ''Since most calves kept
here are likely to be used for beef, we are also looking at ways of
increasing the quality of such animals,'' he said.
''In these ways I believe it is possible, as well as desirable, to
reconcile the different interests of the farming industry and those who
are so concerned about animal welfare.

SHARE prices soared on Wall Street last night as consensus mounted
that a softening American economy should prevent further interest rate
increases by the Federal Reserve.
At on stage the Dow Jones industrial index was up more than 70 points
but some late profit-taking crept in and the index finished up 57.87
points at 3928.64.
Stocks were following the bond market higher, where the 30-year US
Treasury bond was up more than $17 per $1000 face value. Its yield,
which falls when prices rise, slid to 7.58% from 7.73% on Thursday.
Advancing issues led declines by about nearly 7 to 2 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Big Board volume was brisk at 403 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Stocks shot up at the opening bell, after the Labour Department said
unemployment rose to 5.7% last month from 5.4%. Only 134,000 jobs were
added to nonfarm payrolls.
The rise in unemployment surprised economists, who had expected the
unemployment rate to fall by 0.1%, and about 300,000 jobs to be added to
payrolls.
The figures showed that the ''economy may be slowing down enough that
the Federal Reserve won't have to raise rates again,'' said Hildegard
Zagorski, an analyst at Prudential Securities, ''but you have to be
cautious, because this is only one month's numbers.''
Other analysts said they believed the market was over-reacting on the
positive side. ''The surge in average hourly earnings and the workweek
seem to suggest that the inflation seeds have taken root,'' said Bob
Walberg, market analyst at MMS International. ''The Fed is not going to
take a look at these numbers and assume that inflation has gone away.''
Wage rates rose in January by an average 7 cents an hour. The average
work week was unchanged at 42.2 hours.
But the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell
to 97.6 from 99.1 in January. And a monthly inflation index put out by
Columbia University fell in January, another indication that inflation
is receding.
Financial stocks were soared, as investors concluded from the economic
reports that interest rates would remain stable for the time being.
New orders received by US factories rose strongly in December and
posted the biggest annual increase in 15 years for all of 1994.
The 1.7% rise in December orders to a seasonally adjusted $298.6bn
followed a revised 2.7% increase in November orders and was well above
Wall Street economists' forecasts of a 0.9% gain. It suggested steady
manufacturing sector momentum entering 1995.
Manufacturing industries have been booming for the past year and a
half. The total 10.2% jump in 1994 orders was nearly double 1993's
year-over-year gain of 5.8%t. It was the biggest gain in factory orders
for any year since 1979, when they climbed 12.1%.

JOHN COONEY looks at the career of Simon Geoghegan, Ireland's
fair-haired hero who now hails from Baker Street.
SIMON Geoghegan, the Irish winger who lives in Baker Street, London,
can be conjured up in the song by Paisley's Gerry Rafferty:
''Winding your way down on Baker Street,
Light in your head and dead on your feet,
Another crazy day . . .
. . . And then he'll settle down
In some quiet town
And forget about everything,
But you know he'll always keeping moving,
He's never gonna stop moving . . .''
Like many a Scots lad exiled in London, Simon Geoghegan spends as much
time in and out of railway stations -- and the Underground -- as he does
on the playing field. It takes him two and half hours to travel to Bath
from Blackfriars tube station via Paddington for training sessions with
his club.
Second-generation Irish -- his father moved to England in 1955 from a
County Galway farm -- Simon Geoghegan is rated as a world-class winger
by his coach at Bath, Brian Ashton. ''An out-and-out strike runner, a
man who is going to score tries irrespective of whom he is playing for
or whom he is playing against. A very, very exciting player,'' is
Ashton's verdict.
Since first donning the green jersey in 1991, Geoghegan has always
created excitement when he gets the ball, but his performances have
frequently fallen short of his world-class ranking.
He won his first cap for Ireland against France four years ago and he
hit the headlines dramatically in the next match against Wales when he
scored a spectacular try from an intelligent pass from Brian Smith.
In his fourth match that debut year, he got the better of England's
Rory Underwood to score another try for Ireland.
After a spectacular 1991, Geoghegan, however, experienced the doldrums
the following year when he did not get a decent run at the ball
throughout a championship in which Ireland lost all its matches.
A nightmare moment came in 1993 at Murrayfield when he allowed Derek
Stark to get inside him for a soft try for the Scots. Immediately
afterwards, he gave an outspoken interview about how he saw Ireland's
deficiences -- and found himself temporarily suspended from the green
squad.
Geoghegan's poor performance in Edinburgh and his row with the team
management resulted in a loss of confidence in his game. He became the
scapegoat for Ireland's woes when Ieuan Evans scored a crucial try for
Wales at Cardiff. Geoghegan was left out of the Lions team for its trip
to New Zealand.
This set-back fuelled Geoghegan's determination to make a comeback. He
set himself two aims -- to get as fit as possible and to get himself
right mentally.
The return to glory came last season, appropriately against Wales,
when this time he got the better of Ieuan Evans.
Critically, on two occasions towards the end of the match, Rupert Moon
kicked the ball through for Evans. However, twice Geoghegan, though he
had to turn and chase, outpaced the Welsh wing. His confidence was back.
And he confirmed this in the next match against England at Twickenham.
But at Lansdowne Road two weeks ago Geoghegan did not get the chance
to show his pace as Ireland floundered against against the English.
After Ireland's thrashing by England in the opening match of the
season, the Irish supporters are looking to an emphatic return to form
today at Murrayfield by their blond-haired hero from Baker Street, who
travels so often by way of Paddington.

<FLAG>IN WASHINGTON</FLAG>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>980025495</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE city that sometimes calls itself the capital of the world has gone
bankrupt. On Friday its mayor, Marion Barry, finally admitted the
obvious: Washington is incapable of managing its own affairs and is
therefore throwing itself on the mercy of the federal government.
New York teetered on the brink of bankruptcy in 1975 and other
American cities have been in and out of the hands of the receivers.
Orange County, California, with an income greater than Greece or the
Philippines, has just bankrupted itself by speculating in the stock
market.
But this is different. Washington is the national capital.
Its deficit this year is $722m, or 22% of its budget.
There is not the remotest possibility that it can cut services enough
to fill the gap and there is no chance, either, that Wall Street will
lend it enough to cover the deficit this year.
Washington the city cannot print money, like Washington the federal
government. The feds have been running a 5%-10% annual deficit for 30
years. It doesn't matter. This one does.
Mr Barry wants the feds to lend him $267m immediately and to take over
the court system, the city's prison (which is in Virginia), St
Elizabeth's mental hospital, Medicaid, and the welfare system. Other
local programmes that might be federalised are public housing, the DC
General Hospital, and the University of the District of Columbia. Mr
Barry did not mention them on Thursday because Republicans in Congress
would probably close all three down.
This is more than just a temporary disaster that the city will recover
from. It is the failure of an experiment, known as home rule, that began
in 1974, and might well end in the dissolution of that anomaly, the
District of Columbia.
When the federal government was set up two centuries ago, Congress
carved out a diamond-shaped territory on either side of the Potomac
River, two-thirds in Maryland, one-third in Virginia, christened it the
District of Columbia, and built the city of Washington in it.
It was always a constitutional anomaly, part of the United States but
not itself a state. Its citizens are not represented in Congress but
were finally admitted to vote for President, by constitutional
amendment, in 1961. Congress administered it like a colony until home
rule in 1974, and until then congressional committees decided every
detail of its income and expenditure. It was an extreme case of taxation
without representation.
The district lost its Virginia lands after 50 years.
Washington was built between Capitol Hill and Georgetown, and remained
a small, southern town until the New Deal. Since then, it has expanded
to the limits of the district and its suburbs stretch far into Maryland
and Virginia, with an overall population of about 3.5 million.
Greater Washington is very rich. The district isn't. Its population
has dropped steadily in recent decades, falling to 580,000 in the last
census. It has had a black majority for many years: one reason home rule
came so late was that Southern racists who controlled Congress hated the
idea of their city being run by blacks.
It is solidly Democratic, which is why the district will never become
a state: every state has two senators, and the Republicans are not going
to allow the Democrats to acquire two more.
It suffers from the usual consequences of one-party government,
corruption and inefficiency. It employs more than 40,000 people
(including dependents, that's up to a sixth of the population), and the
numbers have not shrunk with the shrinking population.
On the contrary, the rising costs of city government drive everyone
into the suburbs except the very rich and the very poor.
It is this mechanism that has led the city to bankruptcy.
Other cities can compensate by calling on state governments to help.
Detroit, another black-majority city with serious problems, can get
Michigan to bail it out. Cleveland has Ohio, Chicago Illinois, and so
on.
The 50 states are in charge of welfare, prisons, and the court system
and a host of other urban expenditures, spreading the costs between town
and suburb. The most burdensome is Medicaid, the health care programme
for the poor. Washington cannot appeal to its suburbs (Montgomery
County, Maryland, is even richer than Orange County) or to any other
jurisdiction -- except the federal government.
Mr Barry said on Friday that when home rule was instituted (and he was
a leader in that effort), ''We were so anxious to show we could take
care of ourselves, we were thirsty for freedom,'' the city took on more
burdens than it could manage.
So now home rule has failed. The timing is unfortunate: the new
Republican majority in Congress wants to cut federal expenditure, not
add to it, and to shift the burden to the states.
Newt Gingrich, the new Speaker, dropped a bombshell: why not cede the
district to Maryland? Black Washington, personified by Marion Barry,
would hate to admit defeat, but he may have no choice. No doubt he would
remain mayor of the city, but supervised by the state government.
Why would Maryland take on a bankrupt city that no-one else wants?
There is no hope whatever of recovering those lost Virginia territories
or persuading the Virginian suburbs to do their part.
The answer may be in the 1994 election results in Maryland.
The Democratic senator, Paul Sarbanes, won easily but the Democratic
candidate for governor squeaked in by fewer than 5000 votes. The
Republicans nearly carried the state assembly.
If the district were incorporated into Maryland, that would greatly
strengthen the Democratic majority. It would not change the balance in
the national Senate, and one or two extra Democratic Congressmen would
not change much in the House.
Something will have to be done immediately, if only because members of
Congress want their garbage collected, the streets repaired and lit, and
the police to patrol. Perhaps, at last, as a result of the latest
crisis, democracy will come to the nation's capital. About time, too.

DISSIDENT shareholders of assured tenancy company Westscot Homes have
abandoned -- for the time being -- attempts to force the company into
liquidation.
Behind their change of heart was an intervening takeover offer from
Neill Clerk Residential. However, there is a feeling among some
shareholders that the bid is not an attractive one.
Westscot may, therefore, ultimately decide to use what is considered a
strong cash and property base as a launch-pad for expansion. Whether
shareholders would be willing to give up the exit route offered by the
Neill Clerk offer remains to be seen.
The extraordinary general meeting in Glasgow yesterday was called to
consider a resolution originally proposed by nine rebels, who between
them own about 14% of the shares. They had wanted the company to be
wound up voluntarily and Bryan Jackson of accountancy firm Pannell Kerr
Forster to be appointed as liquidator.
However, none of them was willing to propose the motion at the
meeting. Westscot has about #3m worth of properties producing annual
rental income of around #250,000.
Between the tabling of the resolution and the meeting, Neill Clerk
Residential, a unit trust vehicle managed by Neill Clerk Capital, made
its move.
Neill Clerk is offering the equivalent of 126p a share, although
discount clauses mean anyone converting all of their units into cash
within two months of any 100% takeover would receive only 96p.
Westscot's net asset value is said to be 132p a share.

<HEADLINE>Sharp rise in consumer credit December sees 1.5% increase</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CHRIS STONE</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980025497</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FIGURES from the Bank of England show a sharp 1.5% increase in net
consumer credit in December, much higher than expected.
In the month, credit outstanding grew by #865m compared with
November's #707m, substantially up on market projections which had
centred on around #600m. Analysts consider that it reinforces the
Chancellor's decision to add a 0.5% to interest rates.
Lending on credit cards increased by #300m compared with #200m in
November while other loans and advances rose by #500m.
The unexpected fall in the growth in January of MO, the narrow
definition of money supply comprising mainly notes and coins in
circulation, could reflect, in part anyway, an increasing amount of
consumer spending being undertaken through credit cards and forms of
credit. But any confirmation of this would have to await the January
credit figures.
While some industry leaders felt unhappy about Thursday's pre-emptive
interest rate rise -- the third in five months -- analysts believe it
will benefit industry in the longer term if it reduces inflation risks.
The authorities are also anxious to keep a check on consumer spending
which could suck in imports and feed an inflationary spiral.
Analysts said that the relatively modest growth in consumer
expenditure in 1994 of around 2.5% was helping to ensure the economy
grew at a controllable rate. The recovery is export, not consumer, led
and too much consumer spending could cause overheating. That said, some
areas of the economy, primarily housing, remain highly vulnerable.
It remains to be seen what impact the latest interest rate rise will
have on the housing market. Both the Halifax and the Nationwide are
still forecasting modest growth in house prices this year. But mortgage
lenders appear to be holding off from passing on the increase in base
rates for the present, no doubt influenced by the fragile state of the
market and the intense competition.
The Abbey National bank, the second larget mortgage lender, said
yesterday that it would not be raising its mortgage rate in response to
the rise in bank base rates. It said it would maintain its position,
''as long as competitive pressures allow.'' Abbey added: ''We see little
case for changing mortgage rates in response to the latest increase in
bank base rates and would be surprised if any of the other major lenders
drew a different conclusion.''
The trend in interest rates, though, is up. And would need only one of
the major to break ranks for the others to follow suit.

YOU have to pinch yourself to believe that the man talking is in his
76th year. Des O'Brien, lean and long, still plays a mean game of
tennis, a little squash here and there with possibly a dash of hockey
thrown in.
During his distinguished sporting career he was the Irish rugby
captain, the British Lions manager, he also played squash for his
country and was a reserve for the Welsh tennis team. For the last 20
years he has been resident in Scotland, and now lives in Lasswade. ''I
think if it's all right we'll stay,'' he declared with a twinkle in the
eye.
From his pocket he produced a summons from the Irish rugby selectors
informing him of his selection against France over 40 years ago. There
was a hand-written note at the bottom which began: ''Could you continue
as captain?''
When he was first picked, back in 1948, he would cycle from his home
in Dublin to Lansdowne Road. ''They were very sniffy in these days if
you lost a jersey -- it could have cost you a place in the team. You had
to bring your own shorts and socks.''
The side he joined, captained by the great Karl Mullen and starring
fly-half Jack Kyle, went on to win the Grand Slam and followed up with a
Triple Crown. In two seasons Des was on the losing side only once; in
five games against Scotland he never lost at all.
''That still surprises me a bit because they had some fine players. I
played against the back row of Doug Keller, born in South Africa, Peter
Kininmonth and Douglas Elliot.
''The closest result was at Murrayfield in 1951. Scotland had just
thumped Wales 19 -- 0 and we lost our full-back Norton with a broken arm
after quarter of a hour.''
But D J O'Brien saved the day with his one and only international try
as Scotland were sunk 6 -- 5.
Back home, Des was trying to persuade the selectors that he was
perfectly capable of taking part in a squash international on the Friday
before playing at Lansdowne Road the following day. They would have none
of it. ''A little bit of sporting history lost,'' he said.
They did, however, invite him to lead the side to tour Argentina --
providing of course that he stumped up 14s 2d for the visa. The day the
Irish party arrived, after a 36-hour flight, Eva Peron died and the
whole country went into mourning. Ireland were packed off to Chile for a
week.
''Argentina was a fearful place back then. I remember two students
taking down a picture of Mrs Peron after they had had a couple of
drinks. They were arrested and we never saw them again.''
Des O'Brien wound up with 20 caps. He was a brewer with Guinness by
then, posted eventually to Wales then England.
His Lions tour as manager was to Australia and New Zealand with Scot
Mike Campbell-Lamerton as captain. The Tests against Australia were both
won but the All Blacks achieved a 4 -- 0 whitewash.
''While I was in Christchurch I heard there was a job going in the
company as manager of the Scottish operation and I telegraphed my
application. There have been absolutely no regrets about coming here.
''I love Edinburgh, which reminds me very much of Dublin. There is an
affinity between the nations -- we are people of highs and lows. When I
worked in England I marvelled at these guys who could be so cheerful all
the time.''
One of Des' early tasks in Scotland was to pioneer the sales of Harp
Lager. ''It was a joint venture with Scottish and Newcastle and I can
still remember one of their executives telling me how lager would never
catch on in this country.
Des O'Brien is not one of those people who insist that everything was
better in his day. ''Maybe we had a bit more fun but the players of
today are so much fitter.
''I don't welcome the drift towards professionalism but it is
inevitable. The thing to remember is that the game will always be an
amateur activity for the vast majority of participants.
''I believe very strongly in the community of rugby, in the discipline
the game installs, in the value of the frienships made. These things
don't change.''
He utterly rejects any notion that Scotland and Ireland are in some
kind of international third division. ''A lot of nonsense.
''When either of our countries play to their best they can beat anyone
in the world.''
So who is going to win at Murrayfield? ''I have a feeling this might
just be Ireland's year. There are some good backs, that fellow Geoghegan
can certainly shift, and strong forwards.
''I am going for Ireland by a narrow margin.''
We have a pound on it and the Irishman living in Scotland dashes off
to sing in a Gilbert and Sullivan production. These OAPs can be very
exhausting.

IHAVE a new badge. I only wear it in the office, to avoid
misinterpretation. It says simply: ''Why am I here?'' Yes, I know --
you're away ahead of me already. You are thinking to yourself this is
one of those daft time-management devices, intended to make me more
focused on what I am supposed to be doing rather than what I find myself
doing.
Correct, but there's rather more to it than that. Our esteemed
non-executive adviser, about whom I wrote a couple of weeks ago,
recently put us through the time-management mill using a set of workshop
materials he had distilled from the plethora of commercial products
aimed at helping busy people be more effective.
It was an eye-opener. I've been to several commercial courses on time
management, including one when a speaker arrived late, blaming traffic,
and left early citing the need to reach his next (presumably more
important) engagement. All they did was induce a mild sense of
dissatisfaction at being so poor at self-management.
But that was something else. It began with a Personal Planning
Assessment, a questionnaire cunningly devised to highlight our
organisational failings. It confirmed my instincts. The only area where
I was anything like useful was Setting Goals. I was average at Working
Patterns, Interacting and Life Planning; poor at Task Structuring and
Handling Interruptions, and appalling at Controlling Paperwork and
Acting Immediately. Especially the latter.
I can't understand it. I must sit down and think about why I came out
so badly in that respect, once I have a spare moment. Maybe next week.
Thoroughly defenseless, I went into the workshop. The first step was
to understand why time is so crucial to a business manager. It is, of
course, one of a company's most valuable resources.
Particularly interesting was the description of the popular traps set
for time-challenged managers. They include becoming familiar with life
in an atmosphere of crisis and panic, getting a buzz from firefighting,
and settling into a comfort zone in which only easy, routine tasks are
tackled.
Then on to the crucial question: do you manage your time -- or does it
manage you? In my case there was only one answer.
The process, we were told, of improving our use of time begins with
behaviour and attitudes. We have to want to resolve our problem, and to
appreciate it can only be done by becoming more goal-and-result
orientated, and as a result more organised. That's where the badge came
in.
Working out why we are allowed into the office each day, by referring
back to the company structure and our personal job descriptions, enabled
us to set out the main goals and objectives.
We could then define the necessary tasks and prioritise them into
Urgent, Important but not Urgent, Routine and Time-Wasters. That list
could then be sorted into jobs only you could do, and those that could
be done by others.
Nothing to it! All you need after that little burst of organisation is
a time-management system to structure your daily, weekly and monthly
diary. Oh, and there's the small matter of off-loading your unwanted
commitments on to some other poor sod, who in turn is frantically trying
to shovel jobs further down the ladder, and so on. No wonder admin staff
dread their bosses going on a time-management course.
All of this was logical and completely convincing. But, ever mindful
of the weakness of human spirit and the natural tendency to carry on in
the same old muddle, our non-exec had thoughtfully provided a list of 30
snappy hints for immediate time gains.
They included:
* Saying ''no'' to doing jobs that aren't yours.
* Defining who needs access to you.
* Meeting people in their office so you can end the conversation when
you want.
* Making phone calls in blocks.
* Planning meetings.
* Handling each piece of paper once only.
* Putting up a clock by your desk as a reminder of how much you value
your time.
The response in our company has been fascinating to observe. People
look more purposeful. Meetings start and end closer to time. Bright
clocks have appeared all over. Several people have taken to carrying
leather-bound time-management folders.
As for me, I haven't got the time to worry about it.
* Alastair Balfour is managing director of The Insider Group.

UNLIKE other sports, rugby is a unifying force in Ireland. The
All-Ireland team commands support and loyalty on both sides of the
border and the religious divide.
The supporter from Ian Paisley's Ballymena in County Antrim and the
supporter from Dick Spring's Tralee in County Kerry find common ground
in cheering on the boys in Green! Rugby's non-sectarian status contrasts
with the two kinds of football that are played in Ireland -- soccer and
Gaelic.
Before the IRA ceasefire, it was hazardous for fans from the South to
travel to Belfast when Jack Charlton's Republic of Ireland squad was
playing Northern Ireland.
With the peace, much of the tribal tension has gone out of such
encounters --though the competitive drive remains between the two Irish
teams.
Gaelic football has prided itself on being authentically Irish and in
banning the participation of members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
However, there is a debate underway to drop this ban which is seen as
blatantly sectarian. Incidentally, the current President of the Gaelic
Athletic Association is a southern Protestant.
Until recently, too, rugby itself was considered to be an alien or
Protestant game. It was not too well known among republicans that the
Irish patriot, Eamon de Valera, played rugby when he was a boarder at
Blackrock College. He was known as Eddie de Valera then!
The decision to take up rugby by Dick Spring, Ireland's Deputy Prime
Minister, when he was a boarder at Roscrea in County Tipperary,
disappointed his father, Dan Spring, who was a thrice winner of
All-Ireland Gaelic football championships.
But the past two decades have seen a transformation in attitudes
towards rugby, largely as a result of television which has given it a
more popular base. Bill McLaren is as well known in Dublin as he is in
the Scottish borders.
However, rugby retains a touch of class exclusivity in Ireland.
According to Tom Humphries of the Irish Times, the rugby type is not
be heard shouting ''Ah Jaysus Mullin''. Instead, he bellows ''C'mon
Brendy! Cut out the shitinology, NOW!'' There will be a battle of
accents as well as rugby skills at Murrayfield today.

DICK Spring, Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign
Affairs, will watch today's match at his home in Tralee, County Kerry,
with his fingers crossed that Ireland can find the form which abandoned
the team against England two weeks ago.
It is 16 years since Spring played his first rugby match for Ireland
against France at Lansdowne Road.
He recalls his debut as, ''solid, safe fielding, reliable line-kicking
and a couple of unsuccessful long shots at goal, one of which came very
close''.
Spring's second game for Ireland -- against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park
-- is one which he prefers to forget but which time and again returns to
haunt him. A botched attempt to make a running catch in his own 25
allowed Welsh second row, Allan Martin to pick up the loose ball for a
winning try.
With this incident in mind, a biography of Spring by political
journalist, Tim Ryan, is called A safe pair of hands. His recollection
of a third outing for Ireland, against England at Lansdowne Road, is of
a crunching tackle which he delivered on his opposite number, Alastair
Hignell.
But rather than continue in top level rugby, Dick Spring was lured
into politics in 1981 when he stood for the Dail and succeeded his
father, the legendary Dan Spring, as a public representative for Kerry.
When the government was formed after the election, he was appointed a
junior minister.
His last match was at junior level when he played for his hometown
Tralee against Skibereen. The moment of truth came when he was caught in
possession because of lack of pace and soft underfoot conditions. As he
went down, he heard the cry ''I have Shpring. I have the minishtur. I
have the bastard.''
Dick Spring knew his playing days were over.

YOU could be forgiven for thinking that McGrigor Donald has expanded
in the Scottish country dance field rather than law, when I tell you
that it has created enough new partners to make up a set for an
eightsome reel. Fortunately, the eight are equally divided between men
and women.
This is by far the largest number of partners assumed at the same time
by McGrigor Donald. The previous highest figure was three.
The eightsome could be described as Niall's legal eagles, as it was
managing partner Niall Scott's suggestion that the firm promote so many
simultaneously.
He explained to Business Diary that when he became managing partner
last year he carried out a review of the firm's business, and identified
the eight as ready for promotion into expanding areas.
Scott, who raises a few eyebrows when he describes McGrigor Donald as
the largest legal firm covering the UK, said: ''Our business is growing
and there are great opportunities for us.''
Regarding his ''largest covering the UK'' claim, he replied simply:
''The large City firms in London do not cover the UK. They do not have
offices in Scotland, while we have offices in Glasgow, Edinburgh and
London as well as Brussels. We have 50 people in London.''
The new partners and their specialities are Vincent Connor,
construction; Michael Dean, Europe; Mark Fraser, construction; Patricia
Hawthorn, environment and mineral law; Eleanor Kerr, taxation; Christine
McLintock, banking; Michael Spence, property, and Donna Stevenson also
property.
McGrigor Donald now has 46 partners, and the new appointments mean
that some fields such as European and environment and mineral law are
covered at partner level within the firm for the first time.
New look for the
Scott Monument
IF you happen to be in Erskine House in Edinburgh next week and see a
lot of adults scrabbling about the floor grabbing lego bricks from each
other, don't worry -- you are not hallucinating.
It is the Scottish heat of the Lego challenge, organised jointly by
John Laing Construction Group and the Lego company with the cash raised
going to Barnardos.
Taking part in the competition are several leading firms of architects
including Cochrane McGregor, Ian Burke Associates, Parr Partnership,
Oberlanders, Hugh Martin Partnership and Edinburgh District Council.
Ryden, which is one of the sponsors of the event, is the only firm of
chartered surveyors competing.
Each team has to design and build a new Scott Monument out of the
pieces its members manage to grab in two minutes of ''scrabble time''
from the 20,000 Lego bricks which are piled on the floor.
The original Scott Monument, built in 1840-6, was designed by George
Meikle Kemp, a joiner and carpenter who taught himself draughtsmanship
and entered the competition to design the monument under the assumed
name of John Morvo.
I thought the practice of assumed names among architects was a fairly
recent one, used when no-one in the profession wanted to own up to
designing the concrete blocks of the sixties and seventies!
Taking it on the
chin for a laugh
THERE are not many company bosses who will volunteer to put themselves
in the dock, never mind the stocks, in front of their staff, but Gordon
Currie, Scottish regional director of the Graham Group, did just that,
and took it on the chin.
The occasion was a ''fairground'' evening for Graham's suppliers,
customers and staff in the Glasgow Airport Hotel, and was complete with
popgun galleries, coconut shies and heaps of candy floss and toffee
apples.
To add to the authenticity of the evening, a volunteer was needed for
the Aunt Sally stall to take the carefully aimed custard pies. Currie,
who is known to enjoy a good laugh, stepped forward.
Later, still licking the remnants of the custard pies from his lips,
he told Business Diary: ''The fairground theme was designed to bring
together our suppliers, customers and staff at our 37 branches in
Scotland, and I think you can say we succeeded in our aim.''
The group organised the show as a travelling fairground with events in
Carlisle, Edinburgh and Dundee as well as Glasgow.
For those readers who are trying to figure out where the Glasgow
Airport Hotel is, it is the former Normandy Hotel in Renfrew. It appears
the name was changed last summer but no-one has yet got round to taking
the Normandy sign down, although the receptionist answers Glasgow
Airport Hotel when you call.
It is when it comes to giving visitors directions to the hotel that
there must be a problem . . . Try explaining to a puzzled guest: ''Yes,
we are the Glasgow Airport Hotel, but look for the Normandy Hotel
sign!''
Playing a trump
card in Swahili
LAST week Business Diary readers may recall that I commented on the
fact that PRs have their uses, when I recounted how Jim Dow and Malcolm
Brown came together to help make a couple's wedding anniversary more
enjoyable.
Well, Jim Dow of FMS was at it again when he answered the cry: ''Does
anyone here speak Swahili?'' Dow, who claims to have learnt his
journalistic skills on the Tanganyika Standard in Dares Salaam,
nonchalantly nodded his head and said: ''Hapa nadua'', meaning ''I speak
Swahili''.
His opportunity to display his linguistic talent came when he met two
officials of the Kenya College of Accountancy, executive director Daniel
Oruoch and principal John Wanjala.
They were in Edinburgh to meet members of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) to discuss the possibility of it
assisting with training programmes in Kenya.
The British Council had drawn up a list of potential training partners
in the UK so the ICAS was in competition with other bodies. But the
Scottish institute had a trump card -- Jim Dow, its PR consultant who
was in the Queen Street, Edinburgh office at the same time as the two
Kenyan officials.
He chatted happily to them in Swahili, and whatever he said must have
gone down well, for last week the ICAS was told by the British Council
that it had been awarded the contract.
Tonight Jim Dow is dining out with his wife Lorna, daughter Karen and
son-in-law John to celebrate the start of his newspaper career 40 years
ago in Tanganyika.
Record entry
for challenge
CHALLENGER UK expects a record number of entries for this year's Mitel
Telecom Challengers Trophy which is being held at Wellington College in
Bracknell on July 3-6.
Peter Bishop, who commutes between his home in Kent and the Glasgow HQ
of Challenger UK, believes that between 120 and 130 teams will take part
in this year's four-day event, which companies use as part of their
personnel training programme.
Around 20 Scottish firms are attending a presentation on the event in
Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall on Monday.
Company teams consist of four entrants, although a ''senior
executive'' can join in for the last two days.
The entrance fee for the competition is #3950, and in the past
companies such as United Distillers, Exxon Chemicals and Enterprise Oil
have taken part.
Chamber goes
bananas for fruit
IT was a really fruity evening last night when Niall McClure,
vice-chairman of Glasgow Junior Chamber of Commerce, rose to speak at
the 58th Colquhoun Dinner in Trades House.
He began his speech by saying that Malcolm Campbell was the apple of
his mother's eye; becoming a fruit and vegetable retailer was a peach of
an idea; and life for him was a bowl of cherries.
He was making a toast to Malcolm Campbell, not the one who is here and
now, is the new president of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, and who
replied to the toast, but to his great grandfather, Sir Malcolm
Campbell, who bought a fruit and veg business in Glasgow in 1878, and
built it up into a thriving chain of shops.
Guests last night were treated to fruit from the Campbell chain, but
Malcolm Campbell assured them that it was not on a ''sale or return
basis'', a method his great grandfather used to boost sales when
attending functions.
Campbell told the guests that the chain now included 26 retail outlets
with a staff of around 200, and had a turnover of more than #8m a year.
All shipshape
as appeal ends
HARRY Wills, chairman of the development committee of Dundee
Industrial Heritage, is delighted by the results of the Operation
Shipshape appeal aimed at raising funds to tackle wet rot in the stern
of Discovery, the 94-year-old research ship moored at Discovery Quay.
The appeal, which ended in January, raised #88,000 and now Dundee
Industrial Heritage is concentrating on developing the Verdant Works in
West Henderson's Wynd.
The re-created jute factory, which will be a living museum, attracted
a #310,000 grant from the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland. This
means Wills and his committee will not be asked to raise funds from the
public for the venture.
The next time the managing director of Robert L Fleming, a Dundee
packaging company, will be called upon to raise cash is likely to be for
the proposed Museum of the Whale at Broughty Ferry.

BATTLE will be joined tomorrow at Murrayfield for the Royal Bank of
Scotland's Century Quaich.
The trophy was commissioned by the Royal Bank to mark the hundredth
rugby game between Scotland and Ireland in 1989.
Since then the Irish team has failed six times to break Scotland's
winning streak in the annual match.
Scotland not only won the hundredth match but also the following four
games, though last year's joust at Landsdowne Road ended in a draw.
The Irish team will hope to make it a lucky seven tomorrow, but will
have to reckon with Scotland first.
* The solid silver quaich (pictured right) -- which has been on
display this week in Hamilton and Inches, George Street, Edinburgh -- is
a drinking cup traditionally used in both Scotland and Ireland to
signify hospitality and friendship.

Gael has embarked on a series of bi-monthly seminars all over the UK,
showing precisely how its tool, Q-Pulse, can take the drudgery out of
ISO 9000 accreditation
IT has become a truism in the electronics sector that the real action
and the primary source of competitive advantage now lies in software
development, not in the hardware assemblies which all that software
drives.
Software development centres are springing up all over Scotland, the
latest opened by Industry Minister Allan Stewart in Glasgow only this
week. These are the nests from which, it is hoped, lusty new software
ventures will spring.
Look at Microsoft, everyone says. Bill Gates has gone from Ivy League
drop-out to America's richest individual in little more than a decade.
True. But the Microsoft phenomenon masks a more prosaic truth about the
software sector in general.
It is bursting with talent, here in Scotland and elsewhere. But many
of the companies are small, vulnerably small, heavily dependent on one
or two product lines each. Making it in software development, far from
being a glamorous progression from idea to reaping a rich harvest, is
more often a demanding slog. Software is hard ball, for most of the
players.
Such thoughts were prompted by a visit last Monday to a small East
Kilbride-based software business, Gael Quality. Gael has just taken up
residence in another of the West of Scotland's software innovation
centres, in one of the buildings on the National Engineering Laboratory
site in the new town. Monday was, in fact, the day it moved in.
I would not normally feature a business in this spot without some kind
of track record. But Gael does have a track record and a product which,
it reckons, is a UK market leader in its field. Gael was moving to the
NEL complex from Motherwell Bridge, on the other side of the M74, where
it had developed over two and a half years, within the engineering
group's construction division.
The business started when Donald Maciver and a colleague, Ian McCool,
were made redundant when Unisys closed its facility in Livingston. They
were electronic engineers working on design quality. ''Ian is very much
the technofreak,'' says Maciver.
The pair went on the Roots and Wings programme for self-starters,
sponsored by Lanarkshire Development Agency. ''We were expecting to end
up as consultants,'' he explains. But the two men had developed a
prototype software product, now called Q-Pulse, a computer-based support
for any business contemplating accreditation for the ISO 9000
international quality standard. A tutor on the course urged them to turn
that prototype into a marketable product.
Instead of undertaking that task on their own, the pair were invited
by Motherwell Bridge to come in under the construction division's wing,
help upgrade an in-house computer system and develop Q-Pulse as well.
So, in March 1992, Gael Quality established its trading identity, inside
one of Scotland's largest privately-owned groups.
At first McCool concentrated on the in-house upgrade, while Maciver
got on with developing Q-Pulse into a marketable product. ''Our great
strength,'' says Maciver, ''is that the people who designed Q-Pulse have
themselves worked in quality assurance. A lot of systems are developed
by computer boffins trying to put together a tool they think will meet
other people's needs.
''Our other strength was that we assumed nothing about the end users.
We designed this tool with a lot of flexibility so that it sits in with
how each company operates.''
The development period was followed by the first market release of
Q-Pulse, in June 1993. ''The year after that was bloody hard,'' says
Maciver ruefully. ''Ours was one of the first products of its type to
market, but by then the whole idea of quality assurance was getting a
bad press.
''More and more people were saying: 'Look at all the paperwork I've
got to cope with and keep up to date to hold on to an ISO 9000
accreditation.' We found ourselves spending a lot of time convincing
people that, if they didn't have good quality built into their
companies, they wouldn't have a business long term.''
Gael's small team persisted, and slowly the worst of the negativity
over quality assurance subsided. They also developed the Windows-based
product to meet some of the worries and fears of potential users. ''For
example,'' says Maciver, ''Q-Pulse takes a lot of the paperwork fears
away from them.''
In the second half of last year, unit sales of Q-Pulse were picking
up. ''But sales were really too slow for Motherwell Bridge to continue
their support,'' he explains. The main development phase completed,
McCool had left to work for Scottish Design. Last September Maciver and
another ex-Unisys colleague, Derek Jack, started talking to MB about
taking Gael off on its own.
''We had a very good relationship with Motherwell Bridge and we see
that continuing in the future,'' Maciver stresses. ''They've been very
good to us through the transition.''
''It is,'' he adds, ''a very clever organsiation''. From his
perspective it is a collection of 54 smaller businesses all working
under one umbrella. ''We had been running our own books for two years.
The only thing that was done centrally was the accounting function.
The stand-alone Gael Quality, which was created on January 1, is a
three-way partnership, involving Maciver, Jack, and Michael Slade,
recruited back in early 1993 because of his sales and marketing
experience. ''We were all engineers,'' reflects Maciver. ''To suddenly
become marketing and sales people is extremely hard work.''
He believes a combination of elements have contributed to Gael's
rising sales graph. First, a number of other software players have
entered the quality assurance niche. ''There are 18, maybe 20 companies
in the UK now selling quality products. Their arrival has helped to
educate the marketplace and expand it,'' he says.
Second, Gael has embarked on a series of bi-monthly seminars all over
the UK, showing precisely how its tool, Q-Pulse, can take the drudgery
out of ISO 9000 accreditation and, as important, focus management time
on how to keep quality standards high.
The strategy seems to be working. This time last year, Gael was
getting around 80 inquiries a month. Now it is pulling in 250. Sales in
the past four months have equalled those for the previous 14 months.
Buyers range from Maciver's former employer Unisys to Lofthouse of
Fleetwood, the Fisherman's Friend people.
Apart from direct sales, Q-Pulse is also handled by an English agent.
Other agents are in place in Ireland, Hong Kong, New Zealand and
Australia. Export sales are small but growing. Maciver has a particular
eye on the United States.
''Only 3000 US companies are registered for ISO 9000 at the moment,''
he points out. ''There are predictions that it could total 100,000 by
the end of the century. We would like a foothold in that market.''
Is Gael too tightly focussed on a single product in one narrow niche?
''One of the most horrible ways of going wrong in this business,'' he
says, ''is to take on lots of different jobs just to make sure you've
got enough money coming in at the end of the month.
''One of the biggest temptations is to go off and do a bit of
consultancy or training, instead of concentrating on developing the core
business. Sometimes the only way is to keep the focus and accept a
bloody nose for a while.''
There are other Gael products at the embryo stage, but here again the
focus is on quality. Maciver refutes any suggestion that the quality
assurance movement could go into reverse. ''I think it's beginning to
explode again. There are only 48,000 companies worldwide accredited to
ISO 9000 at the moment. But at the end of the day it makes good sense if
it's put in properly and actually controls the business's systems. It
has to feed back, in black and white, where the problems lie.''
Q-Pulse has been chosen by the EU's ITAQUA project as one of a select
band of products to form part of a quality control toolkit for the
Esprit programme. The latest revision will be released in March and will
tackle not just ISO 9000 accreditation but also the Investors in People
programme. And, as we've noted, sales are on the way up.
Gael Quality looks like making it. Donald Maciver has a message to
others contemplating starting a software venture: ''We've gone through
the trauma of taking a product we know is good to market. It's a million
times harder than you think.''
Don't let that put you off. Just don't do it with your eyes closed.

IRELAND'S opening fixture in the 1995 Five Nations Champions was a
game too soon for the man in green. Having last won an opening game in
the Championship in 1988, Ireland went in against England woefully short
of preparation, minus several key players and without a captain of any
real experience at this level.
The weather in Dublin was miserable, once again reinforcing the need
for a serious rethink about the scheduling of the entire Championship,
but while there were such asides as, ''So much for warm-weather training
in Lanzarote'', it was England who coped the better with the conditions
at Lansdowne Road and looked altogether a team that knew what it was
about.
In terms of the Five Nations Championship, which is supposed to be the
most important element in the Irish season, the entire way in which the
fixture list is organised is, at best, counter-productive, and at worst,
downright farcical. Before Christmas, there were five successive
Saturdays for the All-Ireland League, two weekends of Irish/Scottish
games between the provinces and the districts, between the provices and
the districts, games in Dublin against the USA and the South Africans,
then the interprovincial championship matches. After Christmas, the
leagues resume, fitted around the Five Nations games and squad sessions.
Club coaches aren't happy about the lack of continuity, provincial
coaches feel the same, and the men in charge of the national side,
unlike England's Jack Rowell, don't seem to be able to have their top
players available at crucial times in the season.
The Irish/Scottish fixtures, designed to give players from both
countries an extra taste of representative rugby, seemed, at the outset,
a worthwhile innovation, and was certainly welcomed by the players
themselves. Indeed, there was much speculation that sponsors were
queueing up to get involved, a trophy was mooted, but now the whole
concept looks doomed. Having stressed the importance of these games, the
IRFU refused to allow members of either the senior or development squads
to play in this season's games, infuriating the provincial coaches and
completely negating the original thinking behind the series. And, with
the Scottish season about to be restructured around a new league format
which will not include the Irish connection, both countries will lose
out.
All the above would seem to be a matter for the administrators to
resolve, and the sooner the better, if Ireland is to continue to compete
at the highest level, but what was all-too-evident in Ireland's display
against England was that there was never a serious challenge to a
strong, well-prepared, well-organised side who had far too much
experience in key positions.
Ireland's visits to Murrayfield over the past 10 years, have coincided
with some of the most entertaining play in the Championship, and one
hopes for more of the same this year. Despite a victory over Canada,
Scottish thoughts will not be too far away from the game, so mistakes
will inevitably occur. Ireland haven't won at Murrayfield since 1985 and
while the stadium has changed considerably, Scotland are unlikely,
irrespective of the post match camaraderie, to be in anything other than
an uncompromising mood.

A mentally ill mother is refused legal aid while the Maxwell brothers
run up a bill of #4m. Suspicion and discredit surround the whole scheme
AT the offices of Erskine Macaskill &amp; Co there were some splutterings
of astonishment at the #4m legal aid bill run up so far by Kevin and Ian
Maxwell. While the Lord Chancellor totted up for the House of Lords the
soaring cost of preparing a just defence for the sons of Robert Maxwell,
the Edinburgh lawyers had just been wondering what to do next about one
of their clients.
Hannah is trying to keep contact with her two young daughters. She
wants to defend a court action which will take away custody of her
children. Although they are with foster parents, their mother, who has a
long-term mental illness, has managed against massive odds to maintain
weekly visits.
Her application for legal aid to defend the court action has been
turned down by the legal aid board in Scotland.
For Sarah Erskine, a practitioner in family law, such a refusal is no
longer uncommon. The squeeze on legal aid funding, especially on civil
legal aid, she says, means many women who need the protection of the
courts are being denied justice: ''Our hearts drop when we read of cases
of people running up such huge legal aid bills. All it does is add to
the argument that overall legal aid funding should be cut.
''And of course it also reduces the funds available for those who
can't afford to pay to go to law.''
The Maxwell case was one of those which prompted the Government's
review of legal aid and ways of making it more difficult for such people
to claim large sums of money at the taxpayers' expense.
Lord Mackay of Clashfern is looking at various ways of curbing legal
aid for those who lead apparently affluent lifestyles. The consultation
period ends next month. Although proposals in the green paper affect
only England and Wales, because Scotland has a separate legal aid system
overseen by the Scottish Secretary, it seems probable that any changes
would be introduced here too.
The move was prompted by Government embarrassment at massive payouts
to a number of public figures.
Last week it was disclosed that the gym owner who took sneak
photographs of the Princess of Wales is being funded by legal aid in his
High Court battle.
New Zealander Bryce Taylor is to have his #500,000 legal aid bill paid
by the taxpayer after he and the Princess come face-to-face in court
next month when she becomes the first royal family member this century
to give evidence in a major trial.
She is suing Taylor for breach of confidence and contract over the
notorious pictures taken of her exercising at his fitness club in
London. She is also suing Mirror Group Newspapers which published the
photos.
The pictures earned Taylor around #300,000 but within days of their
publication the Princess's lawyers had his assets frozen by the court to
stop him profiting from the alleged intrusion.
He is now allowed only enough cash to cover reasonable living expenses
and claims he cannot get a job because it would jeopardise his legal
aid.
Other tales of seven-figure legal aid handouts, to men like Asil Nadir
and Roger Levitt, have caused public outrage and lead to questions about
whether the system is becoming increasingly expensive and vulnerable to
abuse.
The legal aid bill nationally has risen from #350m in 1988 to
#1.4billion today. In Scotland, the Legal Aid Board receives #120m a
year.
However, Lord Mackay, in announcing his plan to crack down on affluent
claimants who lead lavish lifestyles while milking the system, conceded
that the numbers involved were small.
They had though: ''. . . cast a pall of suspicion and discredit over
the whole legal aid scheme.''
Legal aid, he said, was not there to be exploited by the wealthy, nor
is it there to cushion those who claim to have no money but manage to
leave enviable lives.
His action follows revelations in a number of cases in which men with
amazing lifestyles have qualified for legal aid.
One involved Iraqi millionaire Jawad Hashim, a former aide to Saddam
Hussein, who was awarded #4m to fight an embezzlement case -- despite
owning six homes around the world, and a sumptuous mansion in the
English countryside.
The English Legal Aid Board is now trying to retrieve the cash through
courts in the US where he fled to live to escape prison and where he is,
by all accounts, enjoying a luxurious lifestyle.
Another high-profile case was that of failed financier Roger Levitt,
whose aid bill is expected to cost taxpayers #2m. An insurance
executive, he was convicted of fraud after the collapse of the Levitt
Group and sentenced to 180 hours community service.
Peter Clowes, the financier, lived comfortably in Prestbury, Cheshire,
until jailed for 10 years in 1992 for defrauding Barlow Clowes
shareholders. He was given legal aid but later ordered with his wife to
pay damages of at least #6m to the Department of Trade and Industry. He
continued to protest he did not have the means.
Lord Mackay suggests taking into account the value of a defendant's
home when assessing a legal aid application. For the first time,
anything above a property allowance of #100,000 would count against them
when they are means-tested for aid.
Assets used by applicants but owned by friends and relatives --
including children -- may also be taken into account.
This proposal might have prevented Ernest Saunders, the
#350,000-a-year Guinness chairman, from being granted legal aid to fight
a fraud charge and a #5b civil claim after the takeover of the
Distillers Group. The High Court overturned a decision denying him legal
aid because he reduced his resources by transferring his half share in
his home to a trust for his children.
Other proposals include confiscating undisclosed assets belonging to
applicants in criminal cases and forcing criminals to pay towards their
costs if convicted. A system of loans may be considered.
And officials may be given power to make a subjective judgment on
whether applicants should be refused aid on the grounds that their
lifestyles appeared too opulent.
Which, one might have thought, would have ruled out Asil Nadir, the
bankrupt former chairman of Polly Peck who ran up a #1m legal aid bill
while living in London's leafy Eaton Square before fleeing to Cyprus,
where he continues to live in luxury. His flight from fraud charges may
have denied his duped shareholders justice but it probably saved the
taxpayer a cool few millions in legal fees.
Said Sarah Erskine: ''Legal aid should go to those deserving cases who
need financial support. When I see the loops through which people with
little or no money have to jump just to qualify for legal aid cases --
filling in books of forms, providing evidence of earnings from employers
-- it makes me even angrier that rich men are abusing a system that poor
people increasingly cannot get access too.
The chief executive of the Legal Aid Board in Scotland, Mr Alan
Douglas, said yesterday that the means-testing used to assess whether
applicants qualified for legal aid were similar on both sides of the
Border.
In Scotland, the board makes decisions while in England and Wales they
are made by the Department of Social Security.
''Although we have not had any experience of the kind of cases the
Lord Chancellor has addressed himself to, it doesn't mean we might not.
''The changes such as the curtailment of aid for those who apparently
have fairly expensive houses may therefore be seen as appropriate in
Scotland too.''

THE blarney is in full flow in Edinburgh today. The Irish are here for
the big match at Murrayfield, and pubs, shops, and streets resound with
the brogue. The crack is good.
The Aer Lingus airlift has delivered thousands of fans and their
friends for an extended weekend that will produce a memorable gathering
of the Celts.
Aircraft, flying from Cork, Shannon, and Dublin, have brought in 2000
more people than the airline regularly carries, in small chartered
planes such as Saabs and Fokkers.
For the swarms of visitors, other pursuits will be enjoyed apart from
the central one. While the men watch the rugby teams lock horns at
Murrayfield, their womenfolk shop in Princes Street. There will be
sightseeing too.
It is a two-way process. Some Scots have taken advantage of Aer
Lingus's returning charter planes to take a Dublin break. But there is
no escaping the big match. The visiting Scots will see it on screens in
pubs across the Emerald Isle.
Edinburgh has received a strong infusion of green, but it's all very
wholesome. The city is bulging at the seams this weekend. Beds across
the whole spectrum of accommodation from small guesthouses to the larger
hotels have been snapped up long ago.
Hotel staff are preparing for a long haul. Experience shows that the
Welsh game -- this year on March 4 -- outweighs this one for the numbers
of supporters in town, but the Irish match is starting to grow in
significance.
Mr Franco Galgani, chairman of Edinburgh's principal hotels
association, which has 27 members, and general manager of the Carlton
Highland Hotel, said the Irish weekend is a very important event in the
city's calendar. Mrs Maureen Invernizzi, of the Edinburgh hotels and
guesthouses association, which has 110 members, confirmed: ''It is very
good for our business.''
Although the incomers will savour the local produce, they will find a
distinct flavour of their homeland here. Irish catering has put down
roots in Edinburgh in the past two years.
Bewley's -- something of an institution in Ireland -- arrived in South
Charlotte Street six months ago and is serving its famous coffee and hot
food all day. Its homely interior has an open fire. Staff welcomed rugby
fans at the airport.
Prominent among the Irish pubs, Biddy Mulligans, in the Grassmarket,
is engaged in a whole week of Irish entertainment. Rugby balls signed by
both teams are there to be won in prize draws.
Today's programme begins with a traditional Irish breakfast and will
include live screening of the match.
Mr Derek Rodier, general manager of Thistle Inns, said Irish pubs were
a relatively new idea but they had proved a hit because the Scots liked
their friendly and informal atmosphere.
Another well-known hostelry is Scruffy Murphys, on George IV Bridge,
popular alike with students and lawyers. Opened in November, 1993, the
earliest of the Irish intake, its authentic dark-wood interior was
transported from Dublin. Punters who view the match here can eat Irish
stew at half-time. Even the filled rolls have names such as Top o' the
Tuna and Murphy's Mouthful.
Guinness and Kilkenny beer are on sale in these pubs, and music is
supplied by bands including the Prodigal Sons, the Raggle Taggle
Gypsies, and Rhiannon's Dream.
This is very much a social occasion. The police, who have a control
post in the south-west corner of the new Murrayfield stadium and will
have 125 officers on duty at the game, do not expect any trouble.
Chief Superintendent Charlie Milne, in charge of the west division
which covers Murrayfield and soccer's Tynecastle, said: ''We always look
forward to the Irish coming to Edinburgh because they are very good
humoured, well behaved, and out to have a lot of fun. We don't have any
problems.''
When Scotland and Ireland last met here two years ago, watched by a
crowd of 54,000, only two Irish people were arrested (for possession of
drink) in the stadium.
Irish supporters who have not been here for two years will see the
completed Murrayfield stadium for the first time. In 1993, the
Scotland-Ireland game inaugurated the new North and South stands. Since
then, the new West stand has been erected.

THE famous Garryowen club in Limerick not only invented the
up-and-under kick which sundry full backs wish they hadn't but also
placed before an unsuspecting public a legendary lock called Tom Reid
who gained 13 caps between 1953 and 1957.
Part of Tom's fame stemmed from his description of an unnerving
experience he had when playing for Ireland against England in 1956.
Someone passed the ball to him. Tom graphically expressed mock horror at
this unexpected situation: ''There was oi in the middle of Twickenham
wit 60,000 looking on and wit dis ting in me hands.'' In those days
forwards, especially front and middle row men, were expected to provide
the ball then keep out of the way whilst the aristocrats behind them did
the handling and running. There are those among us who wish that the
same was true in the present day instead of having great lumps, almost
as quick and as skilful as backs, cluttering up the fairway.
Some things have changed however, Irish forwards still breath flame
and aren't alone in not worrying too much about where they put their
feet, but they move the ball by hand as well as any and they are much
more organised in the modern style than in those far off days. Just a
fortnight ago they could not match England's goliaths for size and
strength but their heads never went down and they finished ascendant
with a late try by debutant blindside flanker, Anthony Foley.
What has not changed is that Irish gift, polished in over 100 years,
for presenting the game with a galaxy of personalities whose
philosophical approach to the humps and hollows of fortune and turn of
phrase often provides essential light and shade before, during and after
the heat of the fray.
It was Tony O'Reilly, perhaps the most famous of all Irish rugby men,
who said that the first and most important duty of an Irish captain was
to count the players to make sure they'd all remembered to turn up. Only
O'Reilly could have interrupted an Engish dressing room harangue by
their captain Eric Evans to inquire: ''Has anybody here got a bit of
twine for me boots?''
Another legend in his own time, the famous doctor Jammie Clinch, a
tight forward, once played against a Welsh pack that contained a number
of policemen. When they gave him a real working over, Jammie looked up
and growled: ''Aye, and why didn't you bring your bloody truncheons as
well?''
One of the most gifted of recent Irish back row men has been
Kilkenny's Willie Duggan who frequently was something of a law unto
himself. Willie purported not to like squad sessions. ''Oi'm firmly of
the opinion, he once told me ''that the quickest way to take the edge
off your form is by training. I think he meant it. Willie generally was
one of the last out of the dressing room for a practice sesion and the
first back in when the end was signalled. One story goes that he ran
onto Twickenham for the game against England, realised that he still had
a fag in his mouth, took it out and gave it to the touch judge whilst
asking him if he would be good enough to hold on to it until half-time.
Yet Willie was an outstanding Irish forward who toured with the British
Lyons and captain his country.
Hooker Ronnie Dawson was the complete opposite. A fitness fanatic who,
even as an Irish selector would run for miles round the pitch as the
Irish team trained. Today he looks as fit as when he played over 30
years ago. The Irish along with the Barbarians provide virtually the
last remnants of the true spirit of the Rugby Union game -- the one keen
to win but not treating it as the end of the world if they don't, the
other holding to the concept that players should go out to enjoy
themselves without inhibition by running and handling as often as
possible.
The Irish at Murrayfield today will give their all with aggression and
commitment within a clear-cut game plan. There was serious application
and discipline in their Thursday training session conducted throughout
in battering rain and swamp conditions prior to the England game.
Coaches, Gerry Murphy and Pat Whelan seek to impart total concentration
and skill under pressure to the natural Irish exuberance and passion.
Even Tom Reid expressed the view that ''the result doesn't matter just
so long as ye win.''
But win or lose the Irish will have a boisterous kick at the ball this
evening and some of the crack will make the ribs sore with laughter.
That always has been the Irish.

HALIFAX Building Society has scrapped its low-balance account charge.
This means the #2.50 quarterly charge debited to certain accounts with a
balance of under #50 for 30 or more days in a quarter will no longer be
made. The society said it introduced this charge in 1992 with the aim of
persuading customers to review the way in which they organised their
finances and to help them choose appropriate accounts, which it believes
has now been achieved.
PIM offers fee rebate
PREMIER Investment Management is offering a 25% rebate on commission
charged on its PIMS Scottish Equitable Pension Fund, which is rated the
top-performing managed pension fund since its launch in 1988. Premier
has also begun a re-mortgage arrangement service for which the fee will
be 12.5% plus VAT on the savings achieved in the first year for the
homebuyer.
Hambros fund launch
HAMBROS Bank has launched the Hambros Commodities Fund, an open-ended
investment company, which aims to out-perform the Goldman Sachs
commodity index through investment in the shares of companies involved
in commodities and direct investment through futures contracts.
French sell-off service
JOHNSON Fry has drawn attention to its French privatisation service
which provides a simple way for UK investors to participate in the
privatisation programme there on the same basis as French nationals. The
sell-off currently in progress is SEITA, the tobacco monopoly famous for
Gauloise and Gitanes.

I am 49 years old, single and plan the earliest possible retirement in
a maximum of five years, though it could be sooner. The estimated value
of my personal pension fund in 1996 is #150,000, split into segments to
allow cashing annually to meet my needs.
I have #35,000 in a high-interest building society account plus
#12,000 in various privatisations and unit trusts. I also fund a couple
of 10-year savings schemes costing #1500 per annum, which mature in 1997
and 1999 and will probably be worth #10,000 and #15,000 respectively.
Finally, I have a low-cost endowment maturing in 2006, originally to
cover a #28,500 mortgage which no longer exists.
I intend to continue these schemes until their maturity. I have only
recently joined a new employer's pension fund and contribute 4% in
addition to the company's 10%. Any pension from this source will be
small and only available at age 65.
While I remain in employment I am able to save a further #200 per
month, and I wonder how best to invest this. For the limited working
years I have left, should I fund my personal pension, even from cash
reserves, take out AVCs under my employer's scheme, put the maximum into
a PEP and if so which one, or settle for increasing cash reserves? I
would not be comfortable with high risks.
As you are in a company scheme you can no longer contribute to the
personal pension plan. Given the retirement age provision it would not
be appropriate to make AVCs to the company scheme unless it provided
particularly good transfer terms, which might make it worthwhile to
transfer the accumulated fund to a private plan just before retirement.
It would be a good idea to invest in the new low-risk corporate bond
PEPs when they become available in the new tax year (when there will be
a lot to choose from), using your regular savings, possibly topped up
from the building society. You might also consider putting a lump sum
into the Britannia Building Society Tessa which pays 9.25%, though it
would be locked in for five years.

MORE than anything else, a Murrayfield international is a social
occasion. The level of sociability depends on which of the other four
nations is visiting.
Let us dispose of the English first. A nice bunch of chaps, except
that they keep winning Grand Slams and wander up and down Rose Street,
under the influence of too many half-pints, singing Swing Low Sweet
Chariot. It is only mildly comforting to sing back that they can stick
their effan chariots up a certain part of their anatomy.
Some Scots are unfriendly enough to resort to a spot of violence in
such a situation. Like this English person overheard at breakfast on
Sunday morning after another Sassenach victory, explaining how he got
his black eye: ''There I was celebrating the Grand Slam when this Scotch
person came up and hit me for no apparent reason.''
There is no future for us Scottish chaps in adopting an aggressive
attitude to the English. Just remember that we have lost to far better
people, like the Japanese.
The Welsh. What can we say about the Welsh? They all think they can
sing. Those mournful dirges that would bring a tear to the proverbial
glass eye. And that's when they win. After a defeat they are not so
cheerful.
The best that can be said for the Welsh is that they pump a great deal
of money into the Scottish economy. They come north in great numbers,
usually a full week before the game. Well, so would you if you had to
live in Wales. If you had a cottage there you might even set fire to it
yourself.
But enough of Welsh insults and on to the French. They are even worse
losers than the Welsh and tres dificil language-wise pour avoir un peu
de la crack.
Unless, of course, you belong to a Scottish rugby club which has a
reciprocal agreement with a French team, who visit biennially as
honoured guests. They invariably arrive with case upon case of decent
wine. Teams from the champagne region have their own-label bubbly and
are jolly good company even when they are trying to get off with the
captain's wife.
And so to the Irish. The best of the lot. The Scots and Irish are as
one. We share a soul, a spirit, and a thirst. We both know that the
result is not important but it is important how you celebrate it.
My favourite Irishman was the chap who managed to clear a space in the
packed bar of the Cafe Royal, put down a copy of the Edinburgh Evening
News, and proceed to give an exhibition of step-dancing without tearing
the newspaper. A bit like the wee fellow in the Kung Fu programme on TV
who was trained to walk across the rice paper without leaving a
footprint.
But you need go no further than the Irish players themselves for
setting a pretty high standard when it comes to post-match fun. Ciaran
Fitzgerald, then captain, showed great leadership qualities by turning
up at the Saturday night reception dressed as a priest, accompanied by
his lady dressed as a nun.
Willie John McBride is famous for his post-match conversation with a
would-be rugby groupie. ''You're a big lad,'' she said, looking up but
mostly halfway down his six-foot physique. ''Tell me, are you in
proportion,'' she added suggestively. ''Oh, no,'' he replied. ''If I was
in proportion, I would be eight foot six.''

I would be grateful if you could offer me some clarification as I am
baffled by the differing advice offered by various agencies. I shall be
retiring in May of this year with a lump sum of #50,000 and an
index-linked pension of #18,500 per annum at age 62.
My wife does not work and our other assets are: #12,000 in a deposit
account, #5000 in income bonds, 4000 ScottishPower shares, 270 BT3
shares, 100 Southern Electric, 450 EuroDisney, 500 Norwich Union master
trust units, and 3400 Prosperity Life Accumulated Equity units.
Could you advise me whether I should be putting money into PEPs or
TESSAs, and so on, to try and keep up the value of my lump sum, as I
haven't much of a clue about financial matters.
If you will not require an income from your lump sum and merely want
the capital to grow over the long-term, then a straightforward
investment in several investment trusts would be the best home for it,
if necessary ''bed and breakfasting'' capital gains to take advantage of
the annual tax-free gains allowance. This means selling the shares and
immediately buying them back again to crystallise the gain.
However, if you do need it to generate an income as well as keeping
pace with inflation, you could consider an investment trust PEP or, for
example, Save &amp; Prosper's new Extra Income PEP. If you used the #12,000
in the deposit account you could put the maximum into a PEP in the
current tax year and follow it with a further lump sum after April 6,
giving a potential total investment of #12,000 by you and #12,000 by
your wife.
Part of the balance could be put into Ivory &amp; Sime's new Distribution
Portfolio or, in view of the equity exposure you already have, it would
not be a bad idea to place some capital in risk-free National Savings
products or a Tessa, as well, of course, as having money easily
accessible in the building society for emergencies.
* Some years ago I opened National Savings investment accounts for my
two grandsons now aged seven and four. These accounts are in my own name
''in trust for'' each child. Annually I have been investing #200 in each
one and allowing the interest to accumulate.
There is no trust deed or any other documentation nor are there any
conditions. I merely want the boys to have access to the accounts in
their late teens (or sooner if circumstances suggest that is the correct
course).
Do you foresee any problems, fiscal or legal, arising from this casual
arrangement at any future date, bearing in mind that should I predecease
my wife she would most probably want to continue the payments. In
particular, will there be a problem when it comes time to hand over the
accounts to the boys?
* Although the accounts are in your name in trust for your grandsons,
you are acting as a bare trustee and the money and interest belongs to
the boys. The only complication would be if you were to die, in which
case your executor would need to obtain title to operate the accounts on
their behalf in your place.
Your annual deposits of #200 are effectively gifts to each child and
will probably be covered by inheritance tax exemptions unless used
elsewhere.
National Savings investment accounts for children can be opened at any
time but the ''in trust'' designation is advisable, because children
under the age of seven cannot make withdrawals for themselves. Once they
are seven, they can open and operate investment and ordinary accounts.
* With reference to the self-certification form which I will be giving
my building society to enable me to be paid gross interest on my
savings, would you please inform me if this is simply filed with the
society or is it submitted to the Inland Revenue?
* Completed R85 registration forms should not be lodged with the
Inland Revenue but should be returned to your bank or building society.
There is a note on the form which states that the Revenue will be
auditing a small sample of accounts and records to ensure the scheme is
working properly and the rules are being kept.
The onus, as ever, is on the taxpayer to make sure no false
declarations are made on these forms and that they are only completed if
your total taxable income is less than your total tax allowances. If
these circumstances change, you must tell the building society in
writing as quickly as possible so the registration can be cancelled.
If you have registered and receive interest with no tax deducted and
later think you might be liable to tax after all, you should inform the
Revenue. You should also review your income at the end of the tax year,
and if your total income exceeds your allowances, complete a tax return
and ask the Inspector of Taxes to calculate your tax position.
* I have noticed that the level of interest paid on my current
account, the Clydesdale Bank Premier Account, has fallen dramatically
despite a reasonably healthy balance of perhaps on average #2000 for the
quarter. It was recently credited with the princely sum of #0.59 net.
On making an inquiry I was informed that as interest rates generally
had fallen the rate paid is currently 0.25%, much in line with similar
accounts in other banks. The level of interest paid by the bank seems
hardly worthwhile and certainly appears contrary to the early spirit of
offering a reasonable interest on current accounts.
Are there other accounts offering a similar banking facility with a
more reasonable rate of interest?
* Interest rates have fallen substantially in the past, though since
late last year they have been on their way up again. The account you
refer to is now called the Flexicash Account, and better rates of
interest are available at both the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank
of Scotland, though they are still really only token payments.
Currently, the Clydesdale is offering 0.2% gross (0.15% net) on sums
between #1 and #4999. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which has just lifted
its rates, offers 0.75% gross (0.56% net) between #1 and #999, rising to
1% gross (0.75% net) between #1000 #4999. The Bank of Scotland offers 1%
gross for sums under #2000 and a standard 1.25% gross (0.93% net) from
#2000 to #4999. In all cases the rate rises for higher amounts.
Obviously, unless it is absolutely essential to keep a large sum of
money in a current account, it is better to deposit the bulk of it
elsewhere.
* I will be 53 years old in March, married with no children. I will
have completed 15 years with my present company by mid-May. I currently
earn #28,000 per annum and run a company car. My wife is 52 and retired
from the DSS almost two years ago on a pension of a little over half
pay.
Our current joint net income is slightly in excess of #2000 per month.
We have a #52,000 mortgage on a detached villa, valued at #72,000 plus.
We are paying two endowments on the property. One is for 15 years with
Scottish Amicable due to mature in 2006 and has a monthly premium of
#75. The other is a 20-year endowment with Commercial Union due to
mature in 2007 and has a monthly premium of #112.
We are considering reducing the repayment time of the latter to 15
years, that is maturing in 2002 when I shall be 60. The rationale is
that my company pension scheme allows me to retire at 58 with no loss of
pension for years not worked -- the normal retirement age is 63. I
joined the company AVC in 1980 with monthly contributions of #30,
increased to #50 in 1993 and to #100 this month.
Our pension scheme is reported to be in good shape and our pension
people believe I should be able to retire on at least half salary. At 58
estimated joint income would fall to #1450 per month.
Because of the AVC I can take a lump sum of approximately one year's
salary. This could be more than enough to help repay two years' payment
of mortgage interest plus the increased Commercial Union premium. My
wife will also be eligible for old age pension at the proposed new time
of maturity.
I am concerned, due to the current controversy, about the reliability
of both endowments and would value your view of their current
performance and terminal bonus potential. Do you think our plan is
sensible or do you have alternative proposals?
* It is sensible to have reduced your commitments by the time you
retire, but it might be preferable simply to use the lump sum to pay off
part of the mortgage. There should be no problem with this as the loan
and endowment policies are not indivisible. You could hold back enough
of the lump sum to cover the Commercial Union premiums if necessary.
Increasing the premiums now will enable a more conservative view of
likely future bonus levels, so the Commercial Union policy should
certainly yield the expected maturity value. The Scottish Amicable
policy is arguably more doubtful and could possibly show a shortfall,
though this is unlikely to be large. The company itself is not
suggesting that policyholders increase premiums, though it is keeping an
eye on the situation.
* I am at present fully employed and paying into three different
private pension plans. Advice received from pension advisers has been
conflicting, hence my reason for writing to you.
I have been paying #36 a month into the National Provident Institution
with-profits fund Series 2 since 1986, #36 a month into Allied Dunbar
managed fund since 1988, and #15 a month to Legal &amp; General, which also
gets the payment from opting out of SERPS. My employer pays #20 a month
on my behalf, 50% to the managed fund and 50% to the with-profits since
1989.
Legal &amp; General suggests opting back into SERPS as I am nearly 45
years old and hope to stop working at 60 if possible. Another adviser
suggested I make the NPI fund paid up and put the money which would
normally go there into a managed fund.
What do you think of the current spread of pension payments to
companies? Would you agree or disagree with the advice given? Should I
opt back into SERPS?
* While not being among the top performers, the funds you contribute
to have reasonable track records and you will not necessarily do any
better elsewhere, so you should stick with them.
As for opting back into SERPS, you can only receive the state pension
at the age of 65 so it would not be appropriate if you hope to stop work
at 60. It is uncertain whether it would be worth doing anyway. While you
are approaching the age at which it is generally thought contracting out
of SERPS is not worthwhile for men, rebates may be increased from
1997/98, making this opinion more problematic.

AMID all the talk of Irish jollity, humour, history, and frivolity, it
can be all too easy to forget that what really matters today is that
Scotland's new side for the second half of the nineties gets another win
under its belt, and sharpish.
Finlay Calder, John Jeffrey, David Sole, and Chris Gray all have been
deposited firmly in the receptacle marked ''former internationalist --
part of history,'' and a new generation of kids on the block will do
battle with the island of Ireland's best, as part of the continuing saga
of the Northern Hemisphere's most intriguing sporting contest, the Five
Nations' Championship.
And with this new Scotland side comes a new style to boot.
The men at the top have realised that to play a game where the sole
object of the man in possession is to advance up the pitch, hit a body,
and go to ground, is daft, and very predictable.
Especially in South Africa, on rock-hard grounds, but importantly,
too, against other Five Nations' opposition.
There are no secrets in rugby, and it is hard to comprehend the amount
of time spent by sides monitoring their future opponents' every move.
Pass wind in the wrong place on the pitch and they'll notice midway
through their video analysis, and then they will rewind it to see it
again.
Use a winger on a short move and the whole of the rest of the world
has a hiccup as video sales rocket in rugby playing countries.
So the Irish will, undoubtedly, have realised that the Scots have
abandoned some of their old traits.
The modern Scottish pack, more athletic now with its back-row blend of
ball carriers, will want to expand the game, out of contact if
necessary. It used to be said that passing out of contact was a no no.
Now, it is expected of Rob Wainwright, one of Scotland's most dynamic
and important weapons, that he seeks to take a pass if the forward in
front of him has the ball, and give one out of the tackle if it's on.
Likewise for Eric Peters and Iain Morrison. No longer is the call
given to plough into yet another ruck, committing a handful of the enemy
pack.
Peter Wright, too, has a new lease of life, and a good pair of hands,
and he demonstrated last Saturday against Watsonians that he is more
than capable of being the attacking sweeper around the tail of the
lineout.
Behind them, the tacticians among you will be scouring the day's play
to see just what it is that Scotland have up their sleeves in the centre
pairing of Iain Jardine and Gregor Townsend.
Townsend, the more slight of the pair, will be on the outside, a move
not adopted by many countries.
The aim is clear. Jardine is expected, on the odd occasion, to get to
the gain line like a philandering husband, the forwards will be there to
pile in or take it on if necessary, while the loose ball will be used to
give Townsend the run at the opposition he so dearly loves from broken
play.
It is an unusual set up, but has its merits in defence, where the
stronger tackler of the two, Jardine, is closer to the forwards when
they start to rumble into Scottish territory. A lovely job.
Not as bad as the No.8's though, who, if I remember correctly, is
always told just before he walks on to the pitch: ''Now remember . . .
everything coming back inside is yours!'' Aye, sure bloody thing.
But getting the ball in the first place is never easy. Me, I think
that when we write the Irish off as disruptive and always offside, we do
them a disservice of theatrical proportions.
The Irish are good rugby players. They have their British Lions. They
also have famous old players to live up to.
Ray Gravell, the nutter of a Welsh centre who brought a new dynamism
and meaning to ''crash ball,'' swears he overheard a muttering in the
Irish pack during one game at Cardiff's Arms Park.
The low drone was coming from Willie John McBride, the Irish legend.
''Now listen,'' he heard McBride laying into his pack. ''When I say kick
a head, I mean kick a head . . . any bloody head.
You mess with the Irish pack at your peril.
Fergus Slattery was magical, I know this because he swung at me and
missed during my first cap.
But to dwell in the past is a mistake. Today's Scottish team is very
much under scrutiny and the jury is out.
Gavin Hastings and Damian Cronin have both said that they think the
nucleus of the side can be the one to take Scottish rugby into a new era
. . . the World Cup and then beyond.
To do that they have to prove that they have a fight, and a
determination, that makes the people who watch them proud to belong to
the same country.
It was Cronin, last Saturday, who hinted at the team's resolve. ''I've
heard the criticism levelled at us by some of the former players about
us not being as motivated as them,'' he said. ''But I can assure these
ex-players, some of them I played with, that the fire will never die.''
So today we find out if Scotland does indeed have a team to take the
game forward with pride in this country.
So much depends on class players like Craig Chalmers, Rob Wainwright,
and Gregor Townsend that to single them out seems unfair, but it is
absolutely necessary that so much of what has been described as
''promising'' starts to bear fruit.

THE Herald has this week appointed a new chief rugby writer. The role
has gone to Derek Douglas, 44, who has been a Herald staffman for nearly
15 years during which time he has been chief reporter and Edinburgh
editor.
He has been a regular contributor to the Herald's rugby pages for over
a decade and was a member of the team which supplied The Herald's
unrivalled coverage during the 1991 World Cup.
Douglas is a former editor of his home-town newspaper, the Hawick
Express, and before joining The Herald in 1980 was a reporter and,
later, an assistant news editor with the Scotsman.
He has also written, co-written and edited half a dozen rugby-related
books, most recently editing this year's Scottish Rugby Yearbook. He was
also co-author of Heart and Sole, the best-selling autobiography of
Scotland's Grand Slam skipper David Sole.
Along with the rest of the Herald rugby team, comprising of John
Beattie, Bill McLaren, and Brian Meek, you can be sure Derek will be in
the thick of the action.

THROUGHOUT British industry, firms are consolidating in an effort to
improve efficiency and boost market share. This is the reasoning behind
Glaxo's #9000m bid for Wellcome. Yesterday, attention switched from the
pharmaceutical sector to food manufacturing following confirmation that
Dalgety has agreed to pay #442m ($700m) cash for Quaker Oats's European
pet food business.
Dalgety is raising the money for the purchase from a one-for-four
rights issue at 335p per share to raise #186m after expenses. This
compares with Dalgety's price in the market of 419p, a gain of 23p. City
analysts were bullish about the growth prospects of the enlarged group.
The rights issue is to be made in two instalments. The first is
underwritten by merchant bankers Lazard Brothers. Cazenove and S G
Warburg Securities are joint brokers to the rights issue. Dalgety also
intends to sell its Golden Wonder and Homepride Food businesses, which
are expected to raise more than #300m.
The acquisition will strengthen Dalgety's No.2 position in the
European pet foods market behind Mar's Pedigree brand. The enlarged
Dalgety business will have a 21% share of the branded European pet foods
market sold through grocery outlets compared to Mar's Pedigree pet foods
share of 46%.
In 1993/94, Quaker European pet food had sales of #518m and a market
share in the grocery sector of 12.6%. The business operates widely
throughout the European market and has a strong presence in the three
largest national pet food markets, the UK, France, and Germany, where
65% of its sales were generated in the year ended 30 June.
Quaker's pet food business, including the Felix cat food and Fido dog
food brands, are to be merged with Dalgety's Spillers pet food business,
which includes Arthur's Choice Chunks for its feline customers and Prime
for its canine clients. This will give it market leadership of the own
brand market.
Quaker has been notably successful in developing Felix into the
second-largest brand in the UK with 19.4% of canned cat food sales.
Dalgety expects significant rationalisation and integration benefits
from the acquisition. It is expected that by the third year of ownership
these benefits will amount to about #40m and that during the first three
years of ownership they will amount to around #70m.
The US group put its pet food business up for sale last year after its
$1700m purchase of Snapple, the US soft drinks group. The deal is the
first substantial acquisition by Richard Clothier since he became
Dalgety's chief executive in 1993. In its most recent annual report,
Dalgety expressed interest in expanding in pet food and food
ingredients.
Commenting on the acquisition, Mr Clothier said it was ''an
outstanding opportunity for Dalgety to obtain a significant European
market share in a growing sector worth #4900m a year.
Dalgety expects the European pet food market to grow sales volumes at
3.5% per year during the next five years.
In the six months to 31 December 1994, Dalgety made 8% higher profits
of #60.9m before tax. This was ahead of City expectations. The interim
dividend is to rise by 6% to 8.5p.

SEASON 1993/94 ended with the Development Tour to Argentina. It could
be said that this Tour also heralded the beginning of Season 1994/95.
The two Tests on the Tour could have been won if half the kicks at goal
had been successful. How often have we heard it said in the history of
Scottish Rugby results from matches played against other countries -- if
only . . . ? We appear to be a nation which is content to be tagged ''a
good loser'' and until we throw off that yoke we will never march
forward positively to meet our opponents on equal terms.
With the successes of the eighties/early nineties in winning two Grand
Slams, our supporters have come to expect success from the National
Team, and rightly so. However, we must remember that the 1984 and 1990
Grand Slams were won eleven and five years ago respectively -- old men
look back! Young men must look forward!
The 1995 Five Nations Tournament begins for Scotland with the match
against Ireland on February 4, followed by the French game a fortnight
later in Paris. It is imperative that we strongly contest all our
matches if we are to be ranked in the top six rugby playing countries in
the World and with that in mind, it is equally important that we win our
home games against Ireland and Wales. We have the players who can give
us these wins and I look to the senior players to lead from the front
both mentally and physically.
Since 1973 the Internationals in Paris have been played at the Parc
des Princes and Scotland have yet to win there. 1995 will be our twelfth
visit and it would be an ideal time for our players to notch up their
first win in that time on French turf, as we are drawn in the same Pool
as France in the World Cup later this year.
The cauldron of the Parc des Princes has to be experienced to be
believed but, again, we have the players who, with real Scottish spirit,
are capable of victory.
A win in Paris would be an ideal platform for our visit to Twickenham
a month later, where we also have a few bogies to lay.
Our players should never be in awe of those countries who have a much
larger playing population than the 15,000 we have participating in our
game at senior level as they have been coached and trained by the best.
We have much to be proud of at Murrayfield. On November 19, the
magnificent new stadium was officially opened by our Patron, Her Royal
Highness The Princess Royal. The opening was the culmination of three
years of thoughtful planning by my colleagues, past and present, who
showed great foresight in building an all-seated stadium for 67,500
people. I have often said that the Scottish Rugby Union Committee of the
1920s were very shrewd in purchasing the thirty acre site at Murrayfield
and I hope that future generations will also say that the Committee of
the 1990s showed the same foresight in planning and comleting the new
Murrayfield.

<HEADLINE>Stakis buys Westpoint Hotel for #4.7m</HEADLINE>

THE aggressive expansion drive by the Stakis leisure group moved
closer to home yesterday with the #4.7m purchase of the Westpoint Hotel
on the outskirts of East Kilbride.
The four-star, 74-bedroom hotel was bought from Saltire, an associated
company of Cannon Investments which also runs the Craigendarroch and
Cameron House hotels.
Glasgow-based Stakis, which has recovered financially in the past two
years by concentrating on its hotels and casinos, hopes to add a
30-bedroom extension on to the Westpoint.
Its latest acquisition takes the amount spent on hotels and leisure
complexes -- ranging from London to Bath and the Isle of Man -- to
almost #40m in the past year. More purchases are likely.
''We are not looking at any geographical areas in particular, we are
simply looking for hotels with potential and to which the Stakis name
can add substantial value,'' chief executive David Michels said.
The company is convinced that Westpoint, built only four years ago,
fits the bill with its mix of 70% corporate custom and 30% leisure. The
#54 a night room rate is competitive enough, but an occupancy level of
only 60% leaves plenty of potential for improvement.
Though the recent Rolls-Royce closure is a blow to the area, companies
like Motorola, Scottish Nuclear, United Distillers, and Hoover should
ensure a continued flow of business clients through the hotel, to be
renamed the Stakis East Kilbride.
''Westpoint has already established an excellent reputation in the
area and we intend building on this through the use of Stakis's far
greater marketing and support resources,'' Mr Michels added.
Most of the 135 staff will be kept on at the hotel which also boasts
conference accommodation and a leisure centre with around 1000 members.
The deal is conditional on the transfer of the appropriate liquor
licence.
Only two years after being on the brink of collapse with debts of
almost #200m and losses of #45m, Stakis last month reported a 115% rise
in pre-tax profits to #20.2m.
The company, which has sold its restaurants and nursing homes, has 38
hotels and 21 casinos throughout the UK.

The actress Joanna Lumley is to be replaced by model Naomi Campbell in
a TV advertising campaign. It is a decision that will anger many
THE FINGER that swills around the yoghurt pot is long, slim, tapered
with polish, and 48 years' old. No wrinkles, no liver spots, no thick
yellow-ridged nails.
It belongs to a woman responsible for producing more male saliva than
a stack of steak pies, yet Joanna Lumley has, apparently, been deemed
too old to be the acceptable face -- or finger -- of foodstuffs. Earlier
this week, she was reportedly dropped by Muller from their television
commercials for split-pack yoghurts.
She's known as a ''good sort'' -- heck, this girl's roughed it on a
desert island with only a TV crew for company -- and has taken it all in
splendid form, wishing her successor, supermodel Naomi Campbell, all the
very best in her pot-swilling career.
Muller were quoted as saying they wanted a newer and younger face to
fit the yoghurt, despite Ms Lumley's ''wonderful sophistication, working
wonders for the brand,'' blah, blah, blah. Spokespeople for Ms Lumley
said she had become so big -- celebritywise -- that the firm simply
couldn't afford her for another stint.
In seems acutely unfair in a world where men can sell us everything
from garden fertiliser to washing-up liquid with faces so old, crumpled,
or just plain plug ugly they could melt a monitor.
In real terms, however, the decision to stop using Lumley doesn't make
much sense. Studies are increasingly revealing that ''grey power'' is
beginning to dominate the consumer and leisure markets, and the over-55s
are starting to call the shots when it comes to the type of goods and
services they want to be offered.
A survey out last week said that those in middle age and above are
becoming more mentally and physically active and are spending more time
and money on holidays, eating out, visiting friends, gardening, and
improving their homes. They are one of the biggest buyers of winter sun
holidays. The study concluded that as their powerbase grows, youth and
glamour will become less important in the leisure and consumer sectors.
The Lumley affair also goes somewhat against the grain in advertising
where older women are being signed up to slap their faces -- and bodies
-- on everything from dairy products to the more traditional cosmetics.
Lauren Bacall, whose face has more ridges than the Grand Canyon, will
be advertising milk, complete with a creamy moustache; Lauren Hutton, in
her 50s, is still a cover-girl for Revlon cosmetics; and Anouk Aimee,
the 62-year-old French actress, has been photographed by Herb Ritts for
Donna Karan's spring advertising campaign.
Lumley, herself, has become an icon. In truth, it would be difficult
for an advertiser to find anyone who is more ''90s''.
Born an ''Army brat'' in Kashmir in 1946, she started off in the 60s
as a fashion model, learning the proper knee swivel to propel herself
out of a low-slung sports car. She then followed a flock of dolly birds
into acting, with a stint as a Bond girl and the dynamic Purdey in the
New Avengers, the role which launched a million pageboys.
But it was her ability to reinvent herself, a sharp, incisive mind,
and a quick and self-deprecating wit that lifted her above the
chatterati of the tabloid world and into meatier roles.
The role of Patsy, the ageing Barbie-on-acid from the hit TV series
Absolutely Fabulous, has made her into a superstar with pulling power on
both sides of the Atlantic. These days it's PC for men to ogle her and
it's OK for women to admire her.
In the past few months she has been awarded an OBE and a wax likeness
at Madame Tussaud's, has broken down publicly over animal rights issues,
campaigned tirelessly for a variety of other causes and charities, and
published a book -- which she wrote herself.
In interviews she is candid and often outrageously funny, talking as
bluntly about her nervous breakdown as she does about her experiences in
theatre and the traps and trappings of success.
She has expressed a wish to have trained as a nurse and told The
Herald last year that she puts on the gloss and the glitz because
''that's my job''.
Whatever the reason for her separation from Muller, it will irritate
many who saw her prominence as a small but important indication that
sexism and even ageism were being tackled head-on.
''I thought Joanna Lumley had succeeded in turning attitudes around,''
said Barbara Littlewood, a lecturer in sociology at Glasgow University.
''That's a depressing bit of news. For my daughter and her friends she
is much admired and seen as very glamorous, not just as an older woman
but as a woman full stop.''
Littlewood said there was still a big difference between the way men
and women were regarded when they started hitting their 40s and upwards.
''It is very, very narrow sexism in the most extreme and old-fashioned
kind of way,'' she said. ''Take for example the tabloid stories about
Barbara Windsor last year and her ''toy boy''. I mean he wasn't a
16-year-old or anything. He knew his own mind. This is just something
that tabloid editors find impossible to conceive -- that a man could
actually prefer a woman who has lived, who has got some interesting
experiences, and has a lot of character and guts.''
In the case of Lumley, Littlewood said it was difficult to judge
whether there were consumer factors attached to the decision to drop her
or whether it was sexism, plain and simple.
''I can see that certain men might be very threatened by a woman like
Joanna Lumley. She is well into her 40s, extremely attractive,
confident, articulate, and powerful. I'm not surprised if a lot of men
don't feel a lot happier with a much younger woman around, who are,
perhaps, less sure of themselves speaking out. Good old-fashioned sexism
could well lie at the root of it. It's only when women are in a position
to give women jobs that that might change.
''Maybe younger men, particularly if we have been cultivating them,
educating them, will offer more of a hope. There's not a lot to be said
for older men -- their brains are shrivelling as fast as our boobs are
dropping.''

The scenery in Patagonia will not always have you spellbound, but
there are many other charms and plenty of animal magic to keep you
entertained. William Russell went to the ends of the earth and had a
whale of a time on the Argentinian coast
THE problem about Patagonia is that, when it comes to scenery, the
landscape is markedly lacking in interest. There are superb skies
overhead, but if clouds and amazing sunsets, all pink and scarlet and
swirling cumuli, are not your thing, it can get a little tedious. The
reality is that the terra firma over which your bus is hurtling down a
dead straight road is a flat desert landscape covered in scrub and
pebbles. While botanists might find the bushes full of infinite variety,
for the traveller it is all much of a muchness. A decision that sleep is
preferable until something better comes along is one option -- either
that or read a book.
Why go there in such circumstances? The reason, above all others, is
to visit the nature reserve at Peninsula Valdes, indisputably one of the
world's wonders.
Trelew, as good a starting point as any, involves making a 13-hour
round trip by bus, only about two hours of which are spent looking at
the wildlife. On the other hand the wildlife is astonishing, and, while
you look at it, the wildlife looks back at you with comparable interest.
It would be arguably more convenient to start from Puerto Madryn on the
coast which is nearer the peninsula, but the advantage of Trelew is that
it has the airport, so on arrival you can settle down for the night,
whereas it would be another two to three hours on a bus to Puerto Madryn
after landing, depending on connections.
The important thing is to go at the right time of year. I went in
mid-September, which was early enough. The season runs from September
until March, and mid-September, while one escapes the tourist crowds,
does mean one runs the risk of not seeing as much as one would later on.
Without the whales and the seals there would be little point in going to
any of the sites because there is nothing else to see.
The coastline round Puerto Piramides, from which the motor boats leave
for the whales, is undeniably attractive, but the hinterland is dreary,
and the same goes for Puento Tumbo further down the coast, and a day
excursion in its own right, where the penguins are to be found. If they
are not nesting -- there are more than a million birds in the largest
penguin reserve outside the Antarctic -- stay away. The young penguins
take to the water for the first time in December, but nesting starts in
September.
In high season the whales swimming in the waters off the peninsula are
legion. Because it was mid-September I saw only five, but since they
were right whales doing a ritual mating dance yards from our tiny boat,
whether they had been five or 50 mattered not. They blew great jets of
water, behaved like Esther Williams, tails arcing in unison, flippers
cutting the surface, circling round the boat and getting nearer all the
time. The miracle of man confronting nature in the raw was enthralling.
No whales, however, and it would have been a day of considerable
tedium. The elephant seals were another hour's drive away from whale
bay, living on their own beach. They proved to be great dollops of
blubber wallowing on the shingle, a mere 10-20 feet from the bemused
human spectators. They lay there, basking in the sunshine, roaring,
suckling the odd calf, tossing the pebbles in the air so that they
spattered down on their backs, scratching themselves, occasionally
indulging in a burst of bad temper and a quick bite, content and secure,
and, like the whales, completely unfazed by the audience.
Whales and seals are not the only attractions. There are king penguins
scuttling busily ashore, sea-lions, marooned by the tide, standing
regally on the rocks waiting for the water level to change so that they
can get back to the business of hunting fish, and seabirds of every sort
whirling in the breeze.
Other things to see in this far from pretty part of the world are the
towns founded by the Welsh emigrants who came to Patagonia in the last
century. The others in addition to Trelew are Puerto Madryn, Gaiman,
Trevelin, and Rawson with far away at the foothills of the Andes the
newest ''Welsh'' town, Esquel, founded in 1904. This is frontier land
and the relics of these not-so-distant pioneers are fascinating, no less
so because the tiny museums, housed in the disused railway stations
built by the settlers to service the line which ran from the coast,
contain what would, by any other standards, be bric-a-brac.
To get there you can take a bus from Buenos Aires or fly with either
Aerolinas Argentinas or the domestic airline, Lade. Travel by bus will
be slow, and could involve an overnight stop. But the Trelew bus
terminal is centrally situated and several good hotels are only five to
10 minutes' walk away. The airport is some half dozen kilometres outside
town and has a good tourist desk, which will advise about accommodation,
or, if you are armed, as I was, with both the South American Handbook
and Gerry Leitner's Travel Companion, you could opt for one of the
town's hotels they recommend.
The important thing, whatever you decide, when arriving by air
anywhere is to be positive. Tell your taxi-driver precisely where you
want to go. There is always the risk that the hotel is full, of course,
but most hotels will pass you on to another one, and this way you avoid
giving the upper hand to the driver, something to be avoided at all
costs. I opted for the Hotel Touring Club. It is old-fashioned,
family-run, and its splendid, antique confiteria, or cafe, is where tout
Trewlew seemed to assemble for the daily review of the day's events. If
ever one wished to be in another world, another time, another country,
then this was the place in which to realise that ambition.
Trelew itself is a dull, if pleasant, town whose museum, housed in the
former railway station, will keep you happily occupied for just about
the right length of time. It contains photgraphs of the
nineteenth-century town which one can contrast with the present day, and
a collection of bardic chairs from the annual eisteddfod, which range
from the simple kitchen variety of 1870 to the custom-made model of
1993.
The first party of 150 Welsh settlers, led by Dr William Rawson, after
whom Rawson, the capital of Chubut, is named, arrived in Patagonia on
July 28, 1865, in the brig Mimosa at Puerto Madryn, moving inland up the
Chubut river valley to Gaiman which became their main settlement. Their
leader in Trelew was called Lewis Jones, a magisterial-looking man with
a magnificent beard judging by his photographs, and the town is named
after him, ''Tre'' being Welsh for town, Lew being short for Lewis.
The last contingent from the valleys arrived in 1911, but the Welsh
spirit survives -- as do the little red-brick chapels they built.
Eisteddfods are held annually in Trelew and Gaiman, and the Welsh
language is still spoken, although Spanish is the language of every day.
It is possible, among the dark Spanish complexions, to spot an alien
face, a girl red-gold of ringlet, freckled of skin, pallid of
complexion, a Blodwyn or a Gwynneth. There are also tea-rooms serving
Welsh teas and scones and cakes. The prettiest one in Gaiman was called
Plas y Coed, a little red-brick house modelled on one from the valleys
with lace curtains in the windows, embroidered linen table-cloths,
floral china, and Welsh flowers in the garden. Being spring, there were
daffodils in bloom.

IF lavatorial humour is to your taste, the prospect of an enema fills
you with anticipation of sensual delights beyond endurance, the thought
of a therapeutic massage of the kind given in backstreet parlours, which
are so popular with many of our prominent citizens, intrigues you, or
you abhor meat in all its forms, considering there to be nothing tastier
than a nut cutlet washed down with carrot juice, then Alan Parker's
comedy, The Road to Wellville (18), is the film for you.
A kind of up-market Carry On Irrigating Colonically, it is frequently
very funny, undoubtedly vulgar, and ultimately less than the sum of its
parts. American audiences were apparently not amused -- there are
subjects one does not talk about in God's own country, and bodily
functions are among them. In Europe, where minds are rather broader, the
film may prove less upsetting to susceptibilities.
A more or less true story, it is based on the life of John Harvey
Kellogg, older brother of the man who founded the cornflakes firm. He
set up a sanitarium (that is how he spelt it to avoid the association
with tuberculosis conjured up by sanatorium) at Battle Creek, Michigan,
about the turn of the century.
The San, as it was known, was a raging success. It was a place where
health addicts could freak out on a diet of saunas, mud and steam baths,
electric-shock treatment, celibacy, health foods, and the age's
equivalent of aerobics which they performed in the most sweat-inducing
clothes to merry little tunes.
Written by Parker, and based on a Rabelaisian novel by T C Boyle, the
film stars an unrecognisable Anthony Hopkins, equipped with a marvellous
set of chipmunk teeth, as John Harvey. He runs his rustic sanitarium
with a rod of iron. Each mouthful of food must be chewed 32 times
because ''Nature will catigate those who don't masticate'' and employs
lots of very peculiar machines to stimulate the body, including one
which involves sitting in a bath of water while electric shocks are
passed through the liquid.
John Harvey is pestered by one of his 42 adopted children, now a
down-and-out, played by Dana Carvey, who is seeking revenge for the way
he was brought up -- too much bran, too few cuddles.
To this haven for overweight people whose bank balances are larger
than their brains come Mrs and Mrs Lightbody (Bridget Fonda and Matthew
Broderick). She is a devotee of healthy eating, he is a reformed drunk
turned into an opium addict by the medicine she administered as a cure.
His habit has given him a delicate stomach and he exists on dry toast
and water until John Harvey's cures work their effect on both his
digestion and his libido. Rebuffed by his wife, he finds solace with a
pretty patient in the room across the way. (It is amazing what you can
get up to underneath one of those cages which keep blankets off the
body.)
Meanwhile in the town of Wellville a charlatan, Goodloe Bender
(Michael Lerner in operatic form), is conning a guileless young man,
Charles Ossining (John Cusack), out of money he has borrowed from a rich
aunt to set up a health-food company.
The plot never builds up the speed required by farce, and the
complications conjured up by Parker and Boyle are totally inadequate to
create the obligatory confusion. Although trousers do drop, ladies are
caught undressed in the company of gentlemen similarly displayed, and
the rich aunt descends at quite the wrong moment, when the climax comes
-- it involves the Keystone Cops running amok and an antique fire-engine
-- a feeling of desperation has settled over the whole affair.
Hopkins is very funny as John Harvey, and Cusack and Broderick are on
good form, but there is a limit to the number of jokes one can take
about bowel movements, purgatives, and the pleasures provided by the
bicycle saddle for Mrs Bloomer's aficionados. Mrs Lightbody's discovery
of how a lady can be raised to a higher plain by her masseur -- he
excuses his exploratory technique by explaining it is all right because
he is a doctor -- is also less than hilarious.
For a film which talks about so many digestive, intestinal, and
erotically stimulating subjects not normally discussed across the
tea-table it is surprisingly coy when it comes to many of the parts in
question. Not that one longs for a sight of the stools in the
chamber-pots, whose content and texture are so lovingly debated, let
alone Mr Broderick's apparatus, viewed with such amazement by John
Harvey during an intimate examination with a strange machine --
''Candidly, Mr Lightbody, this lump of flesh I see before me is a
dangerous weapon'' -- or just what it is the masseur is up to, but
Parker's reticence lends prurience, which was clearly not his intention.
The large cast -- there are 56 speaking parts -- go through the
motions, so to speak, stylishly, and watching Hopkins break out of the
strait-jacket of the repressed middle-aged English virgin roles, which
have made him a major star, is worth catching. He demonstrates his
versatility in a performance fizzing with the energy Parker's film
otherwise lacks. John Neville, an unfamiliar face these days, is pure
delight as an elderly society gent taking the waters with the aid of a
most intriguing electrical unchastity belt.
There are worse places to go, however, than Wellville, one of them
being Paradise, the town featured in Trapped In Paradise (PG), a dismal
and unseasonal comedy starring Nicolas Cage and Madchen Amick. The Firpo
brothers, Dave (Jon Lovitz), a pathological liar, and Alvin (Dana Carvey
again), a crazy kleptomaniac, get out of jail and con their slightly
bent brother Bill (Nicolas Cage) into doing a bank robbery in the town
of Paradise.
It is Christmas, the snow falls, and the trio are trapped in the town,
which is home to Sarah Collins (Madchen Amick), whose father's plan to
rob the local bank the two jailbird Firpos have stolen. The good folk of
Paradise prove too much for the Firpos to cope with, the father finds
out that his scheme has been stolen and turns up seeking revenge,
bringing the trio's battleaxe mother with him, the snow keeps falling
and the Christmas spirit is sprayed all over the place like cheap scent.
Directed by George Gallo, who also wrote the script, the intention was
clearly to make one of those old-fashioned seasonal hearts-of-gold
comedies. Somehow things went wrong and instead of feeling pleased to be
in Paradise one longs for it to get lost. Maybe in December, when the
Christmas spirit is supposed to prevail, the film would have worked
better, but in the cold winds of February, when goodwill has pretty well
curdled, it proves deeply resistible. Carvey and Lovitz, mugging for all
they are worth, manage to make Abbott and Costello seem hilarious, while
Cage looks as if he wishes the earth would open up and swallow him.

IN SEPTEMBER I went to the Town at the End of the World. I hadn't
meant to go to Ushuaia -- the ''h'' is silent because should you
pronounce it nobody knows what you are talking about. My plan was to fly
to Buenos Aires, take the bus over the Andes to Santiago in Chile, spend
10 days there, and then visit some of the Argentine towns on the slopes
of the mountains -- Mendoza, Catamarca, La Rioja, and Salta -- on the
way back. But, as I left the office to catch my flight, a colleague said
this time in Argentina, my fourth visit, I really should finally head
south to see what Bruce Chatwin had been on about in his book, In
Patagonia.
It was a suggestion I could not get out of my head. Chatwin's book is
justly celebrated, and although some doubt has been cast lately on just
how much of it he made up, much of it, as befits a travel book, is true.
Along with Paul Theroux's The Great Patagonian Express, it is included
in the essential reading list for all potential South American visitors.
Whereas Theroux gives a typically jaundiced view of the countries he
visited -- he explained when I asked why my experience in Peru had been
markedly different from his that it was because I did not speak Spanish
and so could not understand the misery of the Indians' lives, which,
since I have eyes to see with, seemed a poor excuse for his misanthropy
-- Chatwin's view is highly romantic and he writes beautifully. Like
Theroux, however, he is also out of date.
In Patagonia was published in 1977 -- Chatwin made the journey on
which it is based in 1974. While mysterious, Latin America is not
timeless. It is a continent where things are changing, sometimes for the
better.
Sitting in my hotel room in Buenos Aires I cursed the fact that my
guidebooks were out of date. So I did the easy thing, reached for my
credit cards, went to Aerolineas Argentinas and booked a flight to
Ushuaia, with a stopover in Trelew.
Had I planned the trip I would have purchased an airpass in London.
Only available abroad, it would have allowed me to make more trips by
air inside Argentina and to that extent would have saved me money.
Chatwin described Ushuaia as ''a childless town'' containing
''blue-faced inhabitants'' who ''glared at strangers unkindly'' and, on
leaving for Chile, declared that he went ''as from an unwanted tomb''.
Things have changed out of all recognition. The world's most southerly
town is situated at the head of a bay opening on to the Beagle Channel
named after Darwin's ship. Mountains rise spectacularly behind it,
snow-covered when I was there, crushing the little grid-patterned huddle
of houses into the waters of the bay which are either flat calm or
boiling with swirling white horses. Beyond the bay rise more mountain
ranges, this time in Chile.
The capital of the region with a population of around 60,000, Ushuaia
was founded in 1869 when an Anglican missionary, the Rev W H Sterling,
set up shop there to convert the Yamana or Yaghan Indians. For 16 years
all was well, then the Argentine Navy arrived and with them came the
white men's diseases, in particular measles and pneumonia. Today the
Indians are virtually extinct.
It was another missionary, Thomas Bridges, who came to the region from
the Falklands, who founded the settlement properly in 1871, and set
about recording their language in a dictionary. In 1886, two years after
Argentina formally laid claim to the land, with the Indians dying off, a
family of seven to support and no prospects back home in England, he
persuaded the Argentine Government to give him the title to land at
Haberton some miles down the coast from Ushuaia. There he built an
estancia, raised cattle and a family, and compiled a dictionary of the
Yaman language. Today tours go there for tea and Bridges is Ushuaia's
most celebrated citizen.
In this popular summer resort for Argentinians, the inhabitants are
anything but blue-faced, and there is no lack of children. At the height
of the season -- late November to January -- accommodation is scarce, so
the best time for the independent foreign traveller to go would be
off-season, mid-September to October, the Fuegan spring, or in the
autumn -- April -- when the country is a blaze of red and gold, the
colours intensified by the mineral content of the soil. On the whole, it
is probably better to go as part of a group because out of season, when
tourists are few, not all the tours operate and this is difficult
terrain for travelling round independently.
Ushuaia still has that feel of a frontier town, of somewhere that has
only just arrived, although it also has its sophisticated side. Ushuaia
has some splendid restaurants -- centolla or King Crab a speciality --
and cafes. It has four-star hotels, which cost about $75 off season,
$100 in high season, for bed and breakfast, and excellent lodging-houses
where the B &amp; B price is around the $45 mark. It also has the most
efficient and friendly tourist office I have ever encountered.
Perhaps the first thing is to visit the tiny waterfront museum housed
in a former bank. Ushuaia started off as a penal settlement, closed in
1947 and turned into the naval base. On show also are beautifully carved
bone tools and artefacts made by the vanished Yamani, items belonging to
the founding fathers, and a stunning figurehead of the Duchess of
Albany, Helena de Waldeck, a daughter-in-law of Queen Victoria, taken
from an abandoned ship.
The densely-forested national park, which lies along the Chilean
border, contains the spectacularly beautiful Lago Rocca, and a variety
of wild life.
In the mountains behind the town lie two lakes, Escondido and Fagnano,
where you can hire boats, go fishing, skiing, or ride on motorised
sleighs. You can scale the Martial Glacier above the town, take a
catamaran trip round the bay to see the seals and sea-lions basking on
the Isla de los Lobos, the rocks covered with cormorants and Arctic
gulls, or travel to the Haberton ranch, a lonely, spectacularly
beautiful site down the coast.
The excursions could fill five or six days no bother, and the town
itself is to be strolled round at leisure with pleasure. The traditional
Fuegan houses, with their fretted wood decorations, have charm, and the
Falklands war memorial, an open work map of the islands through which
one can see the backdrop of the Chilean mountains beyond the bay, is a
moving experience.
It is a land of spectacular scenery, chill, clean air, birds and sea
creatures, savage, untamed, exhilarating. I have an urge to go back, and
there are few places of which that can be said. Once is all too often
enough.
* JOURNEY Latin America, who specialise in flights to Argentina, say
that prices will rise in July and August, which is the high season.
Alitalia, which does not operate a high-season policy, has a return fare
to Buenos Aires of #602. Other airlines are Iberia -- #611 return up to
July 15, #666 after that; British Airways #616 return, from July #693;
and KLM #589, after June 14, #699.
* The Argentine Airpass, which has to be bought here in conjunction
with your ticket, costs $450 and will give you four internal flights. It
is valid for 30 days and additional coupons can be added up to a total
of eight at $120 a piece. Only one stop is allowed in each town. There
are tourist desks at the airports and they are usually very helpful
about accommodation. Bus services link all the major towns, the buses
are modern and comfortable, but the journeys can be long. JLA flight

James Traynor asks if Craig Brown would still be manager of the
Scottish football team if they had gone nine games without a win. He
also questions why the rugby media and supporters have not been calling
for the heads of Douglas Morgan, Duncan Paterson, and Gavin Hastings
(January 30).
Consider the opposition that the Scottish rugby team have played
recently: away from home -- Ireland and Wales; at Murrayfield --
England, France, New Zealand, and South Africa.
Put another way, this means that away from home they played the third
and fourth best teams in Europe (if we admit that Ireland and Wales are
both better than us), while at home they played the top two teams in
Europe and also two of the top three teams from the southern hemisphere.
If the Scottish football team had played a run of matches such as this
and not won any, would the football media and supporters be calling for
Craig Brown's head together with that of Gary McAllister?
I think not, and the rugby media and supporters understand and
appreciate the calibre of team we have played while I do not think James
Traynor does.

February 1.
Is James Traynor (January 30) so appalled by the state of soccer in
the UK that he fears being tarred with the same brush? Why has he turned
his attention to rugby, arguing that the SRU has it easy?
The ''peculiar people'' who follow rugby understand that first-class
Scottish national teams are a time to time occurrence and reflect the
development and succession that is required of players. Of course we
don't like losing; we know when we've witnessed atrocious performances
by Scotland, and we know that things require adjusting.
I don't suppose these facts are lost on the SRU either since they too
are supporters and represented their country at the highest level.
We are, however, not about to venture into corruption, back-handers,
match-rigging, and the odd high tackle on spectators in an effort to
sort it out.
James Traynor cannot question the commitment of the people who play
and administer rugby in Scotland. The sport is still of amateur status,
and if and when that does change I would advise the SRU to avoid any
parallel with the antics of professional soccer.
I think we supporters of the ''other code'' have a lot to be grateful
for.

I was surprised to read James Traynor's article implying that any
criticism of the SRU, or indeed of myself, would be considered as
''blasphemy''. What newspapers does he read? His attack was mounted more
on his own journalistic colleagues than on this organisation and I am
sure they are capable of defending themselves.
For our part we welcome all constructive criticism and do our humble
best to respond to it. The much respected Alex Cameron was another of
the football-writing fraternity who used to give us the big stick but we
always made him welcome at Murrayfield. The same courtesy awaits James
Traynor.

I totally agree with Michael and Sheila Cranfield (February 1).
Would Old Camperdown not reconsider his rather autocratic decision if
Lady Camperdown graciously agreed to donate her Diary earnings to a
suitable cause?

The report (Foreign Digest, January 29) that a Viking skull c AD 900
shows evidence of syphilis could give further support to the theory that
the Knights Templar and other Europeans had visited the New World in
pre-Columbian centuries.
It would be somewhat ironic if it were to emerge that rather than the
disease being ''exported'' from the Americas by Portuguese and Spanish
sailors in the late fifteenth century (as was originally believed) it
was in fact simply being returned to its continent of origin.

A WEEK of charming oddities and small but perfectly formed pleasures
for Couch Potato, this; and very refreshing too after the brilliant but
almost indigestibly big and important Schindler's List. If that film was
a five-course cinematic feast with grand cru wines and antediluvian
cognac, this week's highly assorted selection was a reckless pig-out on
cheeseburgers and Coke. Which leads us handily, if with scant regard for
our prose style, into The Hour Of The Pig (rental, 1993, Curzon Video,
cert 15).
Inspired apparently by the historian E P Adams's mind-boggling
medieval study The Criminal Prosecution And Capital Punishment Of
Animals, director Leslie Megahey fastens on the well-documented and far
from unusual trial of a pig accused of murder in fifteenth-century
France and dresses it up with a courtroom suspense storyline out of
Perry Mason and a flamboyant, bizarrely erotic romance a la Peter
Greenaway.
The result is a film that teeters precariously between black comedy,
Ripley's Believe It Or Not, and Carry On Up The Middle Ages. However,
it's all played with great style and visual dash, and it leaves you, as
it should, with a real sense of the ineffable strangeness of the past
and the quirks of human ideology. Whatever sad and weird things some
people believe these days, we've all believed sadder and weirder in the
past, and probably will again. Colin Firth (as counsel for the defence)
and Lysette Anthony (as the accused porker's beautiful gipsy owner)
grace the proceedings with light-footed performances of winning charm.
Moving further back in history to still stranger times, Robert
Bresson's 1974 assault on the Arthurian myth in Lancelot Du Lac
(Artificial Eye, retail, #15.99, English subtitles, cert PG) is a savage
and melancholy meditation on the moral hangovers that follow the failure
of noble ambition. When the bloodied survivors of the Knights of the
Round Table return to Arthur's court without the Holy Grail, they sink
quickly into malice and brutality as Lancelot's love affair with
Guinevere tears apart the masculine bonds of chivalry and Christian love
that formerly united them.
Deeply pessimistic yet at the same time fiercely realistic, Bresson's
beautifully filmed and always gripping parable, cryptic as it often is,
is a memorable and moving film that would make an interesting double
bill with John Boorman's more romantic vision of the Grail tale,
Excalibur. All the players are excellent; Luc Simon and Laura Duke
Condominas are the stars.
And now for a dive into the British bargain basement. Indulgently
dismissed in their day as cheap and coarse horror comics whose principal
artistic function was to make frightened girls cuddle up closer to their
boyfriends in the back stalls of provincial cinemas, the monster mashes
of dear old Hammer Films have lately been garnering an unlikely degree
of serious and even reverent critical attention.
Couch Potato takes no stock in this line of talk whatsoever, of
course, but is nevertheless pleased to welcome the releases of 1965's
Dracula Prince Of Darkness (first time in widescreen) and 1967's The
Mummy's Shroud (first time on video). Both are filled with the usual
British character actors mugging frantically away while saying things If
you value your soul, don't go near the castle! and All who enter the
tomb will die! Christopher Lee (but of course) plays the perpetually
resurgent Count in the first mentioned, and Andre Morell the standard
reckless archaeologist in the second, which was memorably publicised
with the slogan Beware the beat of the cloth-wrapped feet!
Both these fine pieces of British nonsese are released by Lumiere at
#12.99 and #10.99 respectively, certificates 15 and PG. A small prize,
by the way, to the first reader who can remind Couch Potato of the name
of the Hammer film in which the camera pans down a village high street
somewhere in Central Europe before coming to rest on the sign
''Municipal Charnel House''. It's been keeping us awake nights for
years.
And finally, fellow Flintstones fans will be gratified to hear of four
new two-episode releases of vintage Hanna-Barbera caveman episodes, all
cert U and #9.99 per copy (but your local video library will almost
certainly have them to rent). Titles are Rocky Bye Babies (featuring an
appearance by lawyer Perry Masonry); Fred Takes The Field (playing
football for Prinstone against Shale); Dino's Two Tales (adventures of
the original purple dinosaur); and Bedrock 'n' Roll. Unimprovable, if
like Couch Potato you have simple tastes and a childlike heart. Come to
that, a childlike head wouldn't do any harm, either.

January 30.
Allow me to offer my most sincere appreciation of the high degree of
social responsibility and balance of the three articles on the back page
of The Herald (January 3). It was like a breath of fresh air
(particularly in the face of Murray Ritchie's long-apparent bias which,
logically, should see him remunerated as a weekly SNP columnist rather
than a salaried Herald reporter).
However, this excellent back page contrasts strikingly with the
coverage you gave on January 21 to the outpourings of our lunatic fringe
(aka the SNP) in your letters page -- coverage that you have given
consistently over recent years and not just in the letters page.
From my own experience and consultations I cannot believe that there
are no Scots who have the language and the patriotism to contest the
abysmal dishonesty, irresponsibility, and bigotry of the SNP apologists
to whom you so frequently accord space. But I very seldom see them
published.
I accept, of course, that any reputable journal has an obligation to
expose all points of view. However, a journal that lays claim to be
Scotland's national newspaper incurs a commitment to ensure that, in
attempting balance, it does not accord undue publicity to those whose
activities are destructive of the future of Scotland at the expense of
those who love this country and despair of ever seeing the case for
Scotland's future set out sensibly and rationally rather than in terms
of emotion and superstition.
Unfortunately, the independence and devolution nonsense in the letters
page of January 21 is so sweeping and so far from being rational that it
cannot even start to be answered satisfactorily in the length of any
letter to which you have shown readiness to give space. I have watched
this situation repeat week after week for the past 12 years and have yet
to see you counter with anything which presents the many other sides of
the argument but which is not in itself suspect on party political
grounds.
If you wish to merit the title to which you lay daily claim you will
have to do better. One editorial in 12 years is an event. Was it a sop,
or dare we hope that January, 1995, will prove to be a watershed?

So many people who lead protests against the treatment of animals by
farmers live in a romantic haze in which they believe there is no such
thing as nature red in tooth and claw.
They fail to realise that the wild, the jungle, is the most coercive
form of living and that predators -- carnivores -- are just as much a
part of the nature of things as the herbivores they prey upon.
Romantic misconceptions give rise to anthropomorphic ones where
animals are looked upon as humans once removed. The moth-eaten, underfed
animals in the wild equate poorly with the well-fed, well-groomed
animals in zoos.
Despite the hopes postulated in the Bible I doubt that we shall ever
see the lion lie down with the lamb.

I am writing on behalf, I hope, of the millions who sit back and take
no part in public protests. I am thinking, in particular, of the recent
protests against the treatment of veal calves.
Down the years the protesters have awakened our consciences to social
and moral issues. Whether they have been on behalf of animals, people,
trees or any other component of the environment, our debt to them is
incalculable. We must recognise how much we owe to them for those
aspects of our society we consider civilised.

David Clark, the Shadow Defence Secretary, may have a point in
demanding immediate scientific tests at the four sea sites where
munitions and chemical weapons were dumped off our shores between 1945
and 1947.
Mr Soames, the Minister responsible, stated that the majority of these
materials were sealed in redundant cargo ships and scuttled.
It is not unknown for ships to arrive at the bottom many, many miles
away from their known sinking or scuttled position.
This begs the thought: where are some of these ships and their lethal
cargoes?
A full sea bed survey is called for to confirm the positions of these
dumped materials and ships.

Stewart Lamont's column (There's no such thing as human equality,
January 28) was a real hotch potch. According to him, there is now no
real material poverty here, only poverty of spirit.
Perhaps he knows more about pre-war tenement life than I do, for I do
not recognise his description of a time ''when everyone was running up
and down tenement stairs being good neighbours''.
I admit that my recollection is based on nothing more substantial than
having been reared in a pre-war tenement and later working as a
14-year-old rent collector when running up and down slum tenement stairs
was the main part of the job.
I did see many fine and courageous people whose spirit was not crushed
by their environment. Unfortunately they were the minority.
My recollection of the poorer section of the pre-war community is that
very few of them were pillars of the Kirk, so that no abandonment of
religion was involved when they moved into houses with running water and
inside toilets.
I have never heard anyone argue that ''whatever is available to the
richest must be available to the poorest'', but I have heard many people
say that homelessness and deaths from hypothermia are a national
disgrace.

I am glad to be a pensioner and -- like many other pensioners I am
sure -- I resent greatly the way pensioners are used as political pawns,
portrayed as poor, underfed, underclad, old people for whom nothing goes
well. This is not so.
We do not pay prescription charges. We have all sorts of travel
concessions. If we make fewer than #10 per quarter in telephone calls we
get a #12.50 rebate in our total bill. Hairdressers generously have
pensioners' rates on quiet days. Day centres, lunch clubs, church
activities help to solve lonely times.
And our hard-working families provide the tax which provides our
pensions, heating allowances, and Christmas bonuses.

Your front page report (Tax row exposes Labour gulf, February 1) was
inaccurate and misleading. The report referred to the meeting of the
Scottish Labour Party policy forum in November at which the matter of
revenue-raising powers was raised by Jim Stevens and one or two others.
Robbie Dinwoodie quoted an unnamed activist as saying, ''I don't think
this issue just popped up'', because I had allegedly been in the
audience nodding.
Jim Stevens's presentation covered a range of issues including factual
information on the Scottish economy, the distribution of public
expenditure and the tax-raising powers of a Scottish parliament.
It is completely untrue to imply, as your report does, that I endorsed
the argument for changing the party's position with regard to
revenue-raising powers or that I put Jim Stevens or anyone else up to
say anything at the policy forum.

WEDNESDAY was the night when television turned the couch potato into
the jumping bean. You may, of course, have chosen to veg out with The
Private Life of Plants (BBC1) or BBC2's lightweight movie, but fast-lane
viewers were either speeding on Channel 4's new hospital drama (45
medical emergencies in 90-odd minutes) or go-go-going with Central's
Flying Squad pilot on ITV.
Let's take the Sweeney wannabe first. This is the kind of television
which has to fight its way through this critic's preferences, which
incline more to the whodunit than the let's-watch-them-do-it. When it
comes to police series I'm more of a Morse than a Regan woman, although
the excellence of the BBC's Between the Lines has encouraged a taste for
intelligent thrills and spills. The first five minutes of Thief Takers,
however, produced an old reflex of intense dislike.
Bad guys, good guys, you couldn't tell 'em apart. Fruity language,
frantic jump-cuts. Blazing guns, squealing tyres, go-go-GO. Tell me
about it, as they say in EastEnders. But suddenly the fog of ennui
lifted and I found myself gripped -- not so much by the plot, which was
pretty routine, but by the energy of its narrative and the restless,
edgy, cinematic expertise behind its execution. As far as I can see the
future of these Flying Squad officers -- a ripe mix of men and women of
unevenly stable temperament -- is handicapped only by their hats. As a
fashion statement the diced baseball cap don't much improve on old
George Dixon's helmet.
Why fight it? NYPD, Thief Takers, Cardiac Arrest, ER -- the
hyperventilating television of the 90s is television for the short
attention span. Even David Attenborough doesn't hang around to watch
plants grow at their normal rate. We must look to other media for
reflection and sobriety, the chance to muse, the opportunity for
dramatic introspection.
We certainly won't get them in ER (ITV), but for all its surface
values, paper-thin characters, hectic pace and medical hieroglyphics
there is charm in this American blockbuster; and there was rather more
warmth in Wednesday's pilot than in the entire series of Cardiac Arrest,
the cynical, unlovable sawbones show which BBC Scotland makes for the
network. For all that their busy-busy-busy medical staffs seem to have
graduated from the same school of stereotypes (philandering consultants,
suicidal nurses, nervous newcomers, ambitious residents /registrars) and
have the same line in black humour, the ER medics show some degree of
human response to their conveyor-belt patients; while the Cardiac Arrest
lot (a new series in the spring) treat them like potential stiffs.
Happily there are still some corners of our television screens where
our old, cosy, bourgeois expectations of medical treatment find refuge;
a niche where GPs remember the childhood illnesses of each patient and
patients ask GPs to give them away at their weddings. ''Well, well!''
says Ian Bannen's utterly beguiling Dr Cameron in last night's episode
of Doctor Finlay (ITV). ''So young Douglas Cairns has carried off the
bonniest lass in Tannochbrae!'' Didn't you feel a glow in your heart's
cockles? Didn't it make a soothing change from the referred jolt which
comes when yet another patient goes into ventricular fibrillation?
Scottish Television's new series is in good health, ministering ably
to the psychological needs of middle-aged middle Scotland, and no doubt
middle England and Wales. The producers are right to move the characters
along and root around among the darker pages of post-war social history
for their storylines (Casualty's problem now is that the formula has
been set in concrete since the series started in 1986 and the
multi-strand stories and sub-plots, inspired by American manners, were
fresh to British television); although I seem to remember that the
original BBC Casebooks, like the A J Cronin stories, had their bleak and
scandalous moments, too.
Look not to fiction, however, for the week's most disturbing dramas.
Sue Bourne's film Revenge (Cutting Edge, C4) crossed the spectrum from
gothic horror to black comedy with a series of creepy interviews with
people who had done the kind of thing which most of us keep confined in
the murkiest cellar of our fantasies. And for all the farcical elements
in some of these acts of revenge, only one of them was a laughing matter
-- an act of pure peevishness when a Geordie farmer sprayed his council
buildings with slurry when he was refused permission to build a bungalow
on his land.
The rest were the products of raw anger, messy lives, desperate pain
and, in some cases, mental instability. An abused wife dusted her
husband's underpants with itching powder. ''He was absolutely red raw. I
really loved it.'' A betrayed woman wrecked her lover's home and caused
#15,000 worth of damage. ''It wasn't worth it,'' she said from a prison
cell, where she was spending six months on a criminal damage conviction.
''Courage comes from walking away.'' A bereaved father (in a
well-publicised case) shot the loutish lorry driver who killed his son
and was acquitted of attempted murder. ''I felt my inside was going to
burst if I didn't do something.''
Natural justice is a dodgy business. We all know that gut-bursting
feeling when either the law or the bureaucrats or the people we love
haven't the power or refuse to recognise the legitimate nature of our
grievances. ''It isn't fair!'' protest our children, whose moral sense
is clear-sighted and uncompromising. We tell them, and try to warn them,
''Life isn't fair''. But some children never learn, and grow up to be
adults who commit acts of revenge.
Does it help to ''talk it through'' on television? Once again I marvel
at the medium's capacity for persuading people to expose their private
shames and find a wider audience for their public humiliations. What was
the purpose of Revenge? There was no authorial voice, no judgmental
scaffolding to support or consign to the drop the volunteer Furies as
they said their pieces. The makers of this style of confessional
documentary will argue it's not their function to pass judgment; but the
least they could do is provide some moral framework in which to discuss
the rights and wrongs of the wronged.
Some minor acts of vengeance took place in Michael Cockerell's latest
political profile, The Red Queen: a Film Portrait of Barbara Castle
(BBC2). Cockerell played go-between to some long-distance sniping
between two old enemies, interviewing first James Callaghan on her
sacking when he became Prime Minister, and then his feisty old
protagonist, who remains razor-sharp at 84.
After listening to Callaghan's bland, self-justifying version of the
brutal dismissal of an experienced and effective minister, Barbara gave
a chilly little laugh. ''Dear old Uncle Jim,'' she said courteously, as
if about to pay him a compliment. ''How he does smooth it all into a
confused and untruthful picture!''
Elegant insults of that quality are the kind of revenge I can stomach.

Iain Lawson comes dangerously close to resurrecting the same
circumstances of electoral catastrophe he participated in five years ago
when he and several kindred thinkers persuaded the SNP to walk out of
the Constitutional Convention and consequently cost the party the
Glasgow Central by-election several months later.
One might have thought he would have learned from that, or at least
from the political history of the past few years in the former Soviet
Union, in the Balkans and elsewhere, which is that only armed aggression
can frustrate an easy transition from limited legislature to sovereign
parliament.
The Scottish electorate has also become increasingly sophisticated in
these years, and has no illusions that it will take a powerful SNP to
keep Labour on its devolutionary course: the shallowness of both promise
and principle within the Labour Party has become increasingly apparent
recently with the news that Mrs Tony Blair has played a leading role in
the incarceration of poll tax offenders.
Messrs Lawson and Sillars have once again shown their hand with this
latest attack on the leadership; they may yet learn the hard way that
those with a tendency to busted flushes should not play cards.

THE other week on Desert Island Discs I heard that gloating scientist
called Dawkins -- the one who likes to reduce all human behaviour to the
antics of ''selfish genes'' -- telling Sue Lawley about how fashions
spread in the same way as viruses. ''Look,'' he said, ''at the fashion
among students for the 'IQ reducer'; you know, putting your baseball cap
on backwards or sideways so that your apparent intelligence plummets by
50%. You can trace that spreading from America to Europe just like a
strain of flu.'' And I have to say that I was taken aback, I mean, I've
heard of the ''dumbing of America'', the idea that modern educational
methods are making Americans more and more stupid. But this voluntary
self-dumbing, this active renunciation of brains, this rise of Beavis
and Butthead -- that pair of militantly witless cartoon characters -- as
role models for the gilded youth of the planet; that is what the
Buttheads themselves would call ''scar-ee''.
But it wasn't until I tried to get to grips with Radio 1's latest star
Lisa I'Anson (pronounced ''Eye-Anson'') that I began to grasp the full
dimensions of the trend. According to the latest audience figures, the
dizzying decline in Radio 1's listenership has slowed somewhat, although
with a total weekly reach of 11 million it is not much more than half of
what it was five years ago. But if there is any improvement afoot, I
find it hard to believe that Miss I'Anson will be contributing much to
it; in fact, I have a strong feeling that she may be a
computer-generated image, and not a person at all. Her provenance --
from the London pop station Kiss FM -- means nothing to anyone north of
Watford; her publicity photos show an improbably beautiful dusky lady in
a slinky dress, pouting in a manner likely to attract every sad male
fantasist in the land; her voice is standard London-media drawl, with a
husky-bimbo dimension thrown in; and above all, she never says anything.
Oh, she speaks; she bridges the gaps between records by (sometimes)
muttering the name of the artist we've just heard. Last Monday she read
through Radio 1's artists' top 40 with all the vivacity of an
underpowered answering machine, said nothing about any of the artists,
and finally -- on coming across a song called How Do You Sleep? --
wittily asked the listeners ''Oh, well how do you sleep? Not too badly,
I suppose.''
Now, clearly, one of two things is going on here. Can it be that Radio
1 has appointed a presenter the inside of whose head is as empty as a
sound-box? Or has it appointed quite a bright presenter who feels that
it is in her professional interest to play the dumb but exotic bimbo,
Butthead's dream date? Either way, the effect is grim; when she goes off
at two o'clock, and Nicky Campbell comes on, it's like returning from
the land of the cyborgs to the land of the living, where people laugh
and joke and take an interest in things, including music. And for this,
Lisa I'Anson gets quite a good press; which only goes to prove that Dr
Dawkins is right, and that acting thick is fashionable as hell.
Not nearly as daft as his sweetie-wife voice makes him sound, on the
other hand, is Scot FM's new superstar ''Scotty McClue'', who is said to
be Scotland's first ''shock-jock'', and whose late-evening phone-in show
has emerged as a surprise front-runner in attracting audiences to the
new station. Scotty, it seems, is fast becoming a bit of a cult, and
it's easy to see why. His old-fashioned views on sexual politics
(''Never mind sex, son, you get a woman who'll give you a decent fried
breakfast''), and his willingness to talk turkey to men about relations
with women, have taken him straight to the heart of a huge area of
trauma in our society, namely men's bewilderment over the way women's
behaviour has changed in the last 20 years, and their need to talk about
it to someone sympathetic.
Of course, all this could turn very nasty and misogynistic, and I
certainly wouldn't like to see Scotty too involved in politics; twice in
one night, last week, he was strangely unresponsive to men phoning in
about low pay, which seems a bad sign. But he also spent 10 minutes
giving exemplary advice to a suicidal guy who couldn't cope with the
fact that his girlfriend had left him for another man.
Sociological gurus are always saying that men in our culture lack
fathering, men who will talk to them openly about how to be men in these
complicated times. Well, for Scot FM's male listeners, Scotty McClue is
filling that gap, in a very shrewd manner indeed. It remains to be seen
whether he can keep it up without becoming a victim of his own image;
but for the moment he is no Rush Limbaugh, and the real shock-jocks of
the American right would probably expel him on the spot, for being soft
on feminism, and much too nice to everyone.

NIKITA and Katya met last week for the first time in our home. It was
love at first sight. Poor Helen -- Nikita's girlfriend -- was forgotten
in an instant as he fell victim to the seductive smile and the flashing
brown eyes of the visitor from Moscow. Their common language was Russian
and the romance of being young. Their age difference was of little
account. What's a year when you are 5[1/2] and 4[1/2]?
The quiet little boy who used to sit in a corner drawing dozens of
versions of controls for his dream car was transformed into a giggling,
squealing ball of energy as the two of them raced around the confines of
our flat. Faced with the task of amusing these exuberant spirits, we
chose that old favourite -- a trip to the zoo.
I have only been to Edinburgh Zoo four times in my life, once in each
decade, and such was the vivid impression these visits left that I had
little difficulty in remembering the geography: penguins up a bit and to
the left, camels and llamas up the top, and striped cats top right.
They were all still there. Presumably not the same lions -- and I
noticed the Bengal tiger had been swopped for a Siberian one. Not that
it seemed to recognise the tongue of its native habitat as ''Tigr!'' was
cried through the glass by the children. Biggest squeal of the morning
was evinced by the gorilla sitting on top of a huge post at rooftop
height, surveying all around with a baleful glare.
The penguins gave a display of formation swimming beneath the bridge
on which we stood. The sea lions honked as they were fed some
exceedingly smelly fish, and the zebras ran around the chilly heights of
Corstorphine Hill as if they had not noticed they were a little further
north than Kenya. It was all great fun for everyone from 4[1/2] to
fortysomething and -- I am certain -- the animals enjoyed it too. Their
cheery interest in the curious visitors behind the glass was not my
imagination.
Zoos are excellent things. Forget all the rubbish about cruelty to the
animals by keeping them in a zoo. There they are protected, loved, well
fed, and appreciated. If that isn't enough, the zoo plays its part in
conserving species which are at threat in the wild. The Siberian tiger
is scarce and has been selected to be part of a breeding programme. Some
Colombian monkeys have been given a special plastic pipe through which
they can pop out for recreation on the trees in the zoo grounds to
prepare them for possible release back into the wild. (It certainly
makes more sense than releasing IRA terrorists back into the community.)
Since I paid my first visit to Edinburgh Zoo 40 years ago times have
changed. There is now an educational service for parties of
schoolchildren. They learn about threats to wildlife from the
destruction and erosion of their habitat. Ecology and conservation are
the new orthodoxy, and few would want it otherwise. The zoo has its role
to play in this. Children can learn all about the threatened bobo bird
in classrooms but nothing beats the excitement of watching a bobo
waddling about at close hand in a zoo.
A zoo is a lot more animal-friendly than a circus, but both share the
same stricture -- they cannot allow their animals to be entirely
themselves. That would lead to carnage on a terrible scale. The lion
would devour the llama. The owl would do more than wink at the mongoose,
which would have already had a good go at the python. Nature is red in
tooth and claw, and all the jungle books in the world cannot turn it
into Old MacDonald's farm with each animal being allowed its turn at
making its own noise. Some will be swiftly silenced by others.
Perhaps that is no different from the human world which impinges upon
and controls so much of the animal kingdom. Races and nations prey upon
one another or squeeze one another for resources and food. Migrations
upset the balance of species and cause a new pecking order to be set up.
Others manage to destroy themselves by devouring the things they require
to survive or by creating a changed environment in which life becomes
diseased and threatened.
We hear enough of such examples each week for me not to need to be
specific. I have never been able to understand the view of those human
beings who see in nature some kind of garden of Eden, a perfect design
which must never be altered or interfered with. This is far from
claiming that humanity has the right to rule the roost and dispose of
the plant and animal kingdoms as it sees fit. It is to recognise the
basic truth that all is flux and laissez-faire is not the answer.
Conservation requires intervention, even if it means taking some species
away to a zoo in order to help them to survive.
There will never be an ideal balance between the species which inhabit
the earth. Nor will we ever achieve agreement on the best way to use the
resources of the animal world. One man's meat is another man's reason to
picket the cattle truck that brings it. Perhaps we are seeing a new
stage in evolution when homo vegetariensis is about to take over from
homo carnivor. Like all of nature's battles, it will be violent. The
victor will then starve the vanquished into submission and meaty
hamburgers will go the way of aerosols containing CFCs and pipes lagged
with blue asbestos.
Mindful of this possibility we ate hamburgers to round off our day at
the zoo. To paraphrase Ecclesiastes: ''Eat drink and be merry, for
tomorrow the EU regulations may change your diet.'' By the time Nikita
and Katya grow up, carnivorous delights may carry a government health
warning.

LECH WALESA is the most puzzling of men. When he climbed over the
railings of the Gdansk shipyard and began the struggle for freedom in
Poland he exhibited courage and ideals of the very highest. His
subsequent privations, eventual victory at the head of the Solidarity
trade union, and election to the post of state President under a
democratic system appeared to confirm his unique worth to the Polish
nation. Much that he has attempted since then has been disputatious and
divisive. His latest clash with the Government of Prime Minister
Waldermar Pawlak is a case in point. President Walesa believes that Mr
Pawlak's Government, which is a coalition of ex-communists and Mr
Pawlak's own smaller party, is attempting to slow down the process of
market reform. Mr Walesa has tried to split the coalition by wooing the
ex-communists and then by refusing to pass the 1995 Budget. By delaying
this long enough he believes that he has an excuse for dissolving
Parliament.
This last point is dubious in law and potentially disastrous as a
political action. The suggestion by the speaker of Poland's lower house
of parliament that Mr Walesa could be put on trial before the state
tribunal is equally wrong-headed but it is an indication of the
frustration and anger which Mr Walesa's actions have aroused. There is
another agenda. Part of the problem lies with Poland's constitution,
which is an interim affair due for rewriting this year. By the end of
April a national referendum will be held on the new constitutional
proposals and the rush to conflict is driven partly by a desire to
influence the drafting. At the moment the President has loose power over
defence, foreign affairs, and internal affairs. The Prime Minister and
Government control the rest. President Walesa hopes that by putting on
pressure he will persuade Parliament to give the President executive
powers under the new dispensation. It will not, but he remains
unconvinced and ever hopeful.
Even more potent is President Walesa's driving ambition to be elected
for a second five-year presidential term in November. He is prepared to
move heaven and earth, and the resident Government, in order to achieve
this aim. Two things might stop him. The first is the referendum on the
constitution, which he insists on regarding as a referendum on himself.
If he does not get the constitution he wants he will not stand for
president, say his aides. This can be taken at face value, but more
realistically he will stand under any constitution short of a communist
one. An electorate sickened by his constant interventions and
trouble-making is more likely to reject him. It is sad to say so, but it
would be an outcome well deserved.

THE past few weeks have witnessed a remarkable run of success for
supporters of animal rights. The death of one demonstrator and the
violence of others is evidence that any public advantage has to be
qualified. The lack of restraint obvious in many protesters discloses
the underlying intolerance of some: few will envy the role of the
police, whose duty is to remain neutral and maintain public order. The
police are, as so often, placed uncomfortably in the middle -- between
those who are merely earning their living and those who find the means
to that living abhorrent. As far as the veal trade goes the abhorrence
is widely shared, though it will now be shared more widely still. The
fact remains that people want veal and buy it in supermarkets, order it
in restaurants. They will continue to do so; but at least they will pay
far more attention to the origin of the product and will be more likely
than ever before to reject it if they suspect that cruel and unnecessary
methods of husbandry were involved in producing the meat. Most British
farmers do not use such methods but they are commonplace on the
Continent, particularly in France and Holland, and it was against live
exports to such places that the demonstrations were targeted. It is a
doomed trade; and there may even be a bonus in its passing if
continental methods of rearing domestic animals also change.
There may be less welcome consequences, however. The trade in young
calves derives from the need of the dairy farmers to keep milch cows
milking, which is only possible if they have young. If demand for
British veal were to fall away abruptly, calves might have to be
slaughtered very early or the size of dairy herds be reduced. It is easy
to see how the interests of farmers clash with those of the animal trade
protesters; and they certainly would if the success of the present
campaign were to spill over into other areas, like mass methods of fowl
and egg production, where supporters of animal rights have long been
critical.
The underlying motive for such movements is that the rearing methods
are an affront to our own sensibilities. The underlying dynamic is quite
different, however, and related to the general question of animal
rights, a highly contentious area of philosophical speculation which has
generated powerful emotions in some of those who accept the proposition
that animals do indeed have rights and that these have to be respected.
Some of the proponents of this line are extreme enough to give the
impression that they value the lives and welfare of humans less than
those of other animals. It may be early days to worry yet, but it is
seldom too early to worry about the possibility of violence, and some
animal rights campaigners are themselves conscious of the extremist
element within their ranks. The range of targets for attack is wide and
already identifiable, from vivisection to hunting. The veal campaign
will not be the last.

IT is safe to assume that few people want to look old. Mentally, most
people feel permanently young, and resent the fact that they are trapped
inside an ageing body. There are anomalies, of course. Some little girls
are elderly by the age of seven, and look exactly the same as they will
at 60. Rosy-faced old men, by contrast, can look like schoolboys. Our
mind certainly alters its perception of how other people look, which is
why Laurel and Hardy appear middle-aged when we are young, and quite
youthful when we are old. The median age is the face we see in the
mirror.
Staying at a fixed mental age does bring problems, however. At the
annual meeting of Burton's shareholders last week an elderly man
complained that nothing in the group's stores now suited his age group.
The reason, said Burton's chief executive, John Hoerner, is that older
customers have changed their attitudes. ''There isn't much of a market
for 75-year-old men who want to look like 75-year-old men,'' he said.
''We call it down-ageing.'' Even pensioners, according to one
commentator, are now buying designer jeans.
The young, alas, soon find alternative ways of telling the world that
they are young. In the 1980s, when Sir Harold Acton first encountered a
young photographer wearing an ear-ring, he wondered whether it might be
for reasons of health, as piercing the ears was said to improve the
eyesight. ''Or do you think he might belong to a secret society?'' he
asked a companion. Now that BBC producers, theatrical directors, etc
have taken to wearing ear-rings, the young have raised the fashion
stakes by putting rings through their noses. Their target is not only
age, it seems, but bulk, as 30-year-old Thor Valdmanis, the London
Scottish rugby player, discovered when he tried to buy a pair of Calvin
Klein jeans in Sloane Square. A gum-chewing young assistant looked at
his 13[1/2]-stone frame and told him bluntly: ''Calvin does not like
people like you wearing his jeans. You're too thick.''

IN THE past months we've been pursuing the theme of women getting a
raw deal from Scottish history. However, one folk heroine of the '45
Jacobite uprising whose name is etched on the Scottish psyche can have
no such complaints. Flora Macdonald has been elevated to superstar
status, a sort of eighteenth-century Gladiator.
But is her pre-eminent position on the podium as the outstanding
figure, the romantic female lead in this episode of blood and thunder,
fully justified? I think not. No campaign has ever been pursued or war
fought without the active participation and emotional back-up from a
regiment of level-headed women.
As we move towards the 250th anniversary of the collapse of the '45,
I've been excavating in the archives on your behalf in search of
interesting women in the Jacobite ranks and I'm pleased to report that
in one episode alone -- The Incident at Moy Hall -- I came across not
one but two heroines who took as many chances for the cause and put
their lives at just as great risk as oor Flora.
In mid-February 1746, the Jacobite army was moving through the snow
towards Inverness. However, the Highland capital was garrisoned for the
Government by Lord Loudon with a force of 2000 men and so BPC called a
halt at Moy, nine miles to the south. Charles took up residence at the
hall which is the seat of the Chief of Mackintosh.
Although her husband was an officer serving with Loudon, Lady Anne
Mackintosh was described as ''an enthusiastic Jacobite'' and had raised
the clan for service with the Stuart cause. There are stories of her
riding in front of her clansmen as their captain, with a man's bonnet on
her head and pistols at her saddlebow.
When word reached Loudon of the Prince's whereabouts he decided that
although he did not have the manpower to square up to the Jacobite army,
he could stage a secret night march with the majority of his force and
attempt to take the Prince prisoner. The plan was to seal off Inverness
so that no word could reach the Jacobite camp.
There are several versions of how the company at Moy Hall was alerted.
The Chevalier de Johnstone, James Johnstone, the Prince's aide-de-camp,
offers this version. Some English officers were passing the time before
the march in an Inverness tavern and carelessly made mention of the
expedition while being served by the innkeeper's daughter, a girl of 13
or 14. It's said that unable to endure the thought of the Prince's
capture, she slipped out of town and ran the miles to the Moy in her
bare feet to warn of the danger. Other commentators give credit to a
teenage clansman named Lauchlan Mackintosh for raising the alarm.
Whatever the truth, brave deeds were done that night. As the royal
party left the house for the safety of the hills Lady Anne had taken
charge of the evacuation and was, according to another of the Prince's
team, ''running about like a madwoman in her shift''.
Hours after Culloden, some eight weeks later, she was arrested at Moy
and, wearing her blue bonnet and tartan riding habit, was escorted to
imprisonment in Inverness, passing by the piles of Mackintosh dead at
Drumossie Moor.
The Moy Hall incident has an additional strand which we will explore
next week, as remarkable a story as any in the campaign, of how a
blacksmith and four farm labourers turned back Loudon's army of 1500
men.

'It is reassuring
to the returning
exile to find
that the character
and wry humour
of the people have
survived intact'
Returning after 20 years
of trotting the globe,
Gavin Bellfinds Glasgow
'a bewildering experience'
But among the ghosts,
monsters and memories,
he also finds there is still
something to smile about
THE Black Man of Govan has turned his back on modern Glasgow. For more
than a century, he has gazed benignly from a granite pedestal at Govan
Cross on generations of shipbuilders and engineers who formed a
community as seemingly immutable as the Clyde which was its lifeblood.
The dark statue of Sir William Pearce Bart MP, a founding father of
the Victorian shipping industry, faces away from a bingo hall and
pointedly ignores the garish window of a video store. Instead, the
figure known locally as the Black Man inclines his head towards one the
few fine old buildings which remain in the area -- the institute which
bears his name and which now serves as a community centre.
The inscription on Sir William's monument, raised by public
subscription in 1894, reads in part: ''His career furnished a striking
example of what genius combined with energy, industry and indomitable
courage may accomplish, even in a short business lifetime.'' The legend
on a cardboard figure of Robo Cop III in the video store reads: ''Chaos,
corruption, civil war.''
The contrasting images, and the isolation of the Pearce Institute
among its graceless new neighbours, say much about the confusion of a
city in the throes of uncertain transition. For an exile returning to
Scotland after more than 20 years' globe-trotting as a foreign
correspondent, Glasgow is a bewildering experience. It is, above all, a
city of ghosts.
They lurk everywhere -- in the huge, barren wastelands where factories
and housing estates once stood; in the tangled spaghetti of motorways
cutting a swathe through neighbourhoods of vanished streets and football
pitches familiar in childhood; in the Dennistoun Palais, that mecca of
vicarious pleasures now reduced to a dingy supermarket.
It is also a city of monsters. One guards the approaches to the city
centre at Charing Cross, squatting on the Bridge to Nowhere over the M8
motorway -- an ugly brown office block with all the charm of a military
barracks thrown up on a useless overpass. Nearby, other monsters rear
triumphantly over handsome Victorian buildings with malevolent glee,
exulting in their power to dominate a ragged skyline. The splendid
facade of the Mitchell Library is left teetering on the brink of the
motorway, like an elderly gentleman reeling before loutish upstarts.
Presumably the architects persuaded municipal planners that these
hideous towers were a bold vision of a reborn city. They seemed to me
like visions from an Orwellian nightmare, and I wondered which planet
the architects had come from. The extra-terrestial lunatics who
destroyed Charing Cross should be put on the first spaceship home.
Yet not all the changes have been for the worse. I admire the bright
new interior of Princes Square, I enjoy strolling along landscaped
walkways by the river instead of past grimy warehouses, and I welcome
the liberation of central shopping streets from the tyranny of the
infernal combustion engine.
But amid the turmoil of renovation, even the old certainties of
Glasgow's sporting life are gone. What to make of a city where Celtic
are pretending to be Queen's Park (and, some would say, playing like
them), Partick Thistle have taken in Hamilton Accies as lodgers, and
Clyde has gone to share digs with Airdrie over the hills and far away?
Bemused, I enlisted a guide and kindred spirit in Jack Reid, who has
been driving taxis around Glasgow for 16 years. ''I don't like what's
happened here,'' he told me. He thought for a moment, then the
explanation came: ''It's a' the changes. I like Cardonald where I stay,
because it's no' changed since I was a boy.''
In Blackhill we found other kindred spirits in three women huddled in
a close, waiting for a bus. Rain was battering dead houses -- abandoned
council flats with their windows blinded by sheet metal, their roofs
ripped open, and their gardens stinking with rubbish. It seemed a vista
of despair.
But one of the women said: ''Blackhill's no' as bad as people make
out. Ah've been here for 35 years an' ah'd never leave it. See they
empty hooses? The people there didnae want tae leave either, but the
cooncil said they hud tae cos they're gonnie build private hooses. They
should just've left us alane.''
In the architectural jigsaw puzzle of Springburn, a jumble of
renovated sandstone tenements and new housing developments, we found
another statue. It was of a man blowing a flourish on a trumpet,
entitled ''The Bringer'', with the legend: ''Change in Springburn''. The
site is well chosen. Before him stands a truncated tenement block, on a
hill above him gleams bright new homes, and behind him workmen are
constructing a leisure centre.
''That's the problem wi' the tenements,'' Jack observed. ''They want
to keep them and do them up, and they want to knock them down at the
same time. They cannae seem tae make up their minds. So they leave just
bits o' them, which looks daft. The thing is, they just don't fit any
more.''
It was in a shop in Shettleston that I discovered an essential element
of Glasgow had not changed. An elderly man, surveying his change,
informed the girl at the counter:
''Ye should be wearin' a mask.''
''How?''
''Ye're supposed tae wear a mask when ye rob people.''
''On yer bike, Lone Ranger,'' the girl replied with a laugh.
And there it was. Huge areas of the city had changed almost beyond
recognition, but the gruff good humour of its people was intact.
Recently I came with a French friend to Scotland and we went for a
tour of the Highlands. Driving beneath a lowering sky, with rain
sweeping towards us over a sea loch, she said: ''You know Gavin, this is
a beautiful country but it's cold and grey. The people are the sunshine
of Scotland. They are what gives it its warmth.'' She was right, of
course.
Every society has its ba'heids and heidbangers and Scotland is no
exception. But in general, the inherent decency and good nature of Scots
have few equals in the dozens of countries I have reported from. It is
reassuring to the returning exile to find, amid dramatically altered
urban landscapes, that the character and wry humour of the people have
survived intact.
Searching deeper into my past, I went to Motherwell. It was from there
I had been flitted to Glasgow as a wide-eyed child in the year that
war-time rationing ended.
Our tenement was gone. Not only our close, but the whole block, along
with the factory next door. All that remained of Factory Road was a
delapidated row of four terraced houses, dwarfed by two 17-storey tower
blocks standing where our home had been.
''Naebody knows where Factory Road is any more,'' confided a woman who
emerged from one of the terraced houses. ''Least of a' the council when
we need a damp course done.''
My grandmother's semi-detached bungalow was still standing near the
remnants of the Ravenscraig steelworks, but the industrial giant that
once illuminated the night sky with the flash of its blast furnaces was
deathly still. The life had gone out of it, and it was waiting to be
reborn as an ''urban village'' with a university college, and business
and industrial parks.
Much of the rest of the Motherwell I had known as a child had been
wiped off the map in the 1970s, when urban planners decided to destroy
the town centre with its old shops and tearooms and replace it with a
concrete mall and an inner ring road. The population has declined by
15,000 in the past 20 years, male unemployment is now over 14 per cent,
and last month the ratio of unemployed to job vacancies was 13:1.
Alistair Maclean, senior planning officer at Motherwell District
Council, was not around when the old Cross disappeared. He agrees that
much of the character of the town went with it, and he hopes to do
better with the redevelopment of the huge Ravenscraig site.
''The aim is to create a pleasant community for people to live and
work in, in harmony with the environment. But with the best will in the
world, we can't recreate the Motherwell of old. The days of a big single
employer and tenement life are gone.''
Maureen Johnstone, the head teacher at my old primary school,
Glencairn's, was reassuring. ''The people of Motherwell are just
amazing,'' she said. ''Their poverty never shows in their children, who
are always well dressed and well cared for. Even the towers have been a
success here. You'll find most of them have pot plants on the landings,
and social clubs that organize outings for the children and old folk.
This is a warm-hearted community, and they've taken their community
spirit from the tenements into the towers.''
So there it was again. Misguided architects had torn the guts out of
an old town, but its heart was still beating to familiar rhythms.
I suspect that if the Black Man of Govan were to step off his pedestal
today, he would be as bewildered as I. He might admire some of the
gleaming new towers and modern homes, stare in horror at monoliths of
concrete rabbit hutches, and regret the destruction of graceful old
landmarks. He would probably feel lost, but I like to think that, after
hearing a few familiar accents, he would feel as I do: that Scotland's
most precious asset -- its people -- has not changed, and that it's good
to be home.

Sorry folks, but it's soon to be the end of the road for
Francis Urquhart, the master of the political dirty trick.
But his creator, Michael Dobbs, has another card up
his sleeve. Robbie Dinwoodie reports
The character I
plan to develop is
not going to be
nearly so cyncial
PICTURE a tough, ruthless Prime Minister. You may say that is a
contradiction. I couldn't possibly comment. The Premier is presiding
over Sunday lunch at Chequers and wants a private word with a
confidante.
To do this, the PM turns to get rid of an incompetent, obsequious Home
Secretary. You may say these last four words are self-evident. Again, I
couldn't possibly comment. Anyway, the PM goes on: ''Geoffrey, why don't
you go and have a wander through the Long Library before lunch?
Fascinating collection of first editions -- Sartre, Hemingway, Archer.
Right up your street . . . ''
Superb! These giants bestriding the twentieth century, providing an
unbroken thread of philosophical and literary genius; Jean-Paul Sartre,
Ernest Hemingway, and Jeffrey Archer. What a hoot!
Reading these words the night before meeting their author, I shattered
the silence of the early hours with such guffaws as to waken the dog and
make sleepy eyes brim with tears. Laugh? I thought the duvet would never
dry.
Which is why Michael Dobbs is better than the sum of his parts. He is
not Sartre, nor, assuredly, is he Hemingway. He is, however, comparable
with Archer, not least because he is a novelist who became deputy
chairman of the Conservative Party. Taking in that obvious linkage --
mildly mocking Archer, and by implication himself -- Dobbs pulls off a
neat trick, presenting his work as knowing, not too serious, but a cut
above that of his rival, nevertheless. And it is, too.
FOR SOME curious reason, early dust-jacket photographs of Dobbs create
an illusion. On the back of the 1989 original of House of Cards he
appeared as terribly youthful and not a little smug in a blazer and
white shirt, his neat hair brushed, his cheeks smooth. Meeting him now,
you therefore expect a five-foot-nothing head boy and find instead a
larger, burlier chap, full of the confidence that a string of
bestsellers and television spins-offs has brought him. Oh, yes.
Confidence. And money.
The final part of the trilogy which began with House of Cards and
continued with To Play the King was published last week. By the autumn
The Final Cut will be on television, with Ian Richardson playing for the
last time the corrupt, venal and self-serving Premier, Francis Urquhart.
The fictional incumbent of Number 10 serialised on the Beeb is also a
murderer, blackmailer, and adulterer. But then, none of us is perfect,
are we?
One of the pertinent points about Francis Urquhart is that his name
came about through a play on letters, punning with an insult. Dobbs
admits that he started with the initials F U and then cast around for a
name to fill the gap. Urquhart sounded stolid, Scottish, and plausible.
A bolt of lightning shot down from the Big Ben clocktower and a monster
was born.
The other is that Dobbs claims it was not a monster intended to see
the light of day. ''I didn't write House of Cards for publication, I
wrote it as a challenge to see whether I could write a book,'' says
Dobbs. ''I had no intention other than for it to end up as a pile of
paper sitting on a shelf for great-grandchildren to discover.
''Then the Times carried a piece and publishers got in touch. I
thought I either had to stop or take it a bit more seriously. Suddenly
it all happened. I didn't harbour this ambition to be a writer, I never
sat around a dinner table and said I had it in me.''
The reason Dobbs was taken seriously was his known inside track as a
former journalist turned Saatchi executive at the time when the
advertising agency was revolutionising the approach to political
propaganda in Britain. A friend and confidant of Margaret Thatcher and
Norman Tebbit, he was in the Grand Hotel in Brighton when the IRA bomb
went off.
Where did this monster Urquhart spring from? ''I don't think he is a
real politician,'' says Dobbs. ''I think he has nothing in mind other
than power.
''I am not saying that all politicians are great, noble creatures but
most of them -- in fact almost all of them -- come in with an agenda and
want changes. People take Francis Urquhart very seriously. I have
difficulty taking him seriously at all.''
Some who did not have difficulty taking F U seriously were at the BBC.
The original novel was handed to a team headed by Andrew Davies, whose
bleaker, cynical view turned the tale into compulsive viewing -- darker,
sexier, and more extreme than Dobbs's original.
What startled reviewers was not Dobbs's writing style -- Hemingway it
ain't -- but the uncanny resemblance of the plot to the unfolding of
real events. It was a look at the scramble for power in the
post-Thatcher period. Soon after the book hit the shelves Thatcher was
ousted. In the book a decent wet has inherited Downing Street and a
ruthless right-winger, Urquhart, sets out to topple him. There were also
prescient little whiffs and shafts, such as a share-dealing scandal.
The kindest cut of all ensued. Spotting the potential, the BBC
scriptwriters decided not to slay the golden goose. Instead of letting
Urquhart commit suicide at the end of the first series (as happened at
the end of the book), they rejigged the ending in a way which demanded a
sequel.
Dobbs is an admirer of the television adaptation. ''My books are
thrillers,'' he said. ''They turned them into black satire, but
television is a totally different medium. My business, my skill, is
writing political thrillers but I have not been tempted at all to try to
write television scripts or write satire that mirrors what Andrew Davies
did with my work.
''Authors who get too involved can do a great deal of harm because
they don't understand television. It is like selling a house; you may
have built it, you may have lived in it, loved it, but once you sell it,
it's up to the new onwers. You can't tell people how to decorate the
rooms.''
From being a renegade Chief Whip using confidential material to
blackmail his way to power, F U fought and won a royal showdown with a
liberal new king in his second volume. The weapons of war are scandals
within the House of Windsor leaked to the media. Again, he hit the mark,
and the blacker, even more cynical, televised version became compulsive
viewing.
The third and final part is less obviously predictive -- we know that
because it includes a British male doing well at Wimbledon. It is
certainly less timely, dealing with the end of Urquhart's decade in
power and positing an SDP-style split in the Tory Party. But Dobs
stressed: ''That's deliberate. People have developed this idea that I am
some kind of soothsayer, that I can predict the future and my books are
about that.
''To a certain extent I have developed current issues but I don't set
myself out as a soothsayer. I want people to read my books because they
are works of entertainment, not for any other reasons. I am not writing
books as a political pundit. I happen to think this is the best book I
have written in terms of the literature.''
His justification for this claim is the sudden vulnerability of
Urquhart himself. ''I killed Francis Urquhart off before. In the book To
Play the King the king eventually won in the end. This time I decided F
U must go.
''He is a human being now, not a cardboard cut-out beast. He has
become much more of an individual. You begin to feel some sympathy and
understanding for him. He is a man of 65, he is physically beginning to
creak, he is vulnerable politically.
''He is worried about his own manhood now and he is asking himself,
'When I go, what have I left behind? I have got no kids. I have made all
these sacrifices. All I have is Elizabeth and my reputation'. So I hope
people will warm towards him.
''They think they understand him now for the first time, which makes
them even more sympathetic to him, which is why I hope they are going to
be even more angry that this is the last one, because it's only by
having people shouting for more that I am going to be able to launch a
new character.
''The alternative would be to go on and on until they turn round and
say it's not quite what it used to be. It would be very disappointing,
having had so much fun and success, to have that response but it would
also make it more difficult to launch a new character. So in marketing
terms, if you like, it is the right thing to do.''
Ah, the old Saatchi tactician coming through. But what about the
similarity between Urquhart's dog-days and the end of the Thatcher era?
''There are one or two parallels -- not to make Francis Urquhart
Margaret Thatcher with trousers -- but there are one or two scenes, such
as the calling in of cabinet ministers one by one.
''But if I had wanted to make Francis Urquhart a male version of
Margaret Thatcher I would have made him a very different character and
found many more points of similarity, but I think it would have been
nuts to try that.''
ONE DAY a week Dobbs devotes to Tory Central Office, planning for the
next General Election -- which, incidentally, he is convinced is two
years away. Two more days a week Dobbs ventures out from his home in
Dorset to glad-hand on behalf of the party. Each day he will visit half
a dozen constituencies, taking soundings from the faithful, reassuring
them that the opinion polls are not telling the full story about Tory
fortunes. If he is the party's roving ambassador, hasn't his Francis
Urquhart trilogy painted a pretty grim picture of morality at the top of
British politics?
''That's absolutely right! It's something I worry about actually
because I am not a fan of cynicism in politics. I think that the
cynicism has done a lot of damage over the last 20 years.
''If you say it has not helped in terms of justifying the existence of
politicians there may be some element of truth in that, although if you
look at the books as opposed to the television series, the good guys
always win, the bad guys always lose.''
To my disappointment, Dobbs, as a former journalist, trots out the
familiar Tory refrain that sleaze and poor personal standards in high
places are got up by the media. ''The great men who really dominated and
made an impact in the past would not have survived that kind of exposure
in the modern world. What's happening is that a lot of people who would
have gone into public life are saying: 'Why bother? All I'm going to get
is grief'.
''Respect for politicians has gone down and the effectiveness of
politicians has gone down, and I don't think that was necessary. As for
the royal family, how on earth can we expect anyone to survive with the
sort of dredging over their private lives they have had?
''It's just too much. As someone said the other day, what interests
the public may not necessarily be in the public interest.''
So into this climate, Dobbs will drop a more wholesome figure. ''The
next character that I plan to develop is not going to be nearly so
cyncial. He is going to be a very different character indeed -- a
totally different politician, a back bencher.
''Whereas Francis Urquhart was all about power this chap is simply an
ordinary, well extraordinary, back bencher. He is not interested in
office, he is in there because he wants to help as a constituency
politician.
''Such a politician is in a wonderful position. He is allowed a view
about anything, he is allowed to ask questions, he is allowed to get
involved in almost anything.
''It gives him the position to be involved in the great questions of
state. It expands the number of problems he is involved in. There will
be as many villains in my next book as there are in any of my books, as
many great issues, but they will be seen from a rather different point
of view. I hope it will be a character that people will be able to
identify with more than they can with Francis Urquhart.''
A new character, in other words, whose attitude to the world is not F
U.

Bob Marley, the
first Third World
superstar, would
have been 50 next
Monday. As Jamaica
prepares to
celebrate his life,
Margaret Vaughan
recalls the man she
interviewed shortly
before his death
WESLEY the driver is weaving round the bare-arsed urchins on Hope
Road. He swats off the raggedy boy on the bonnet at the red light. Oh
maan dey like flies, mun. Throws a big melon slice smile over his
shoulder, hand dangling a spliff out the window, fingers drumming a
reggae rhythm on the wheel, fast accelerating, vrooooom, round the
corner of Sangster's Bookstore, cussing at the lame and smearing grimy
dusters on his windscreen at Half Way Tree. He drives at the locked
gates of number 56. The car screams and judders and Wesley jumps,
wrenches open the doors. We jolt and fall out.
T'ING is, ya know, mi caant help but love im, mun.
Then he's gone.
We meet a man with a cat called Tripod, hirpling from sun blissed
verandah to garden, rooting round the kitchen, one leg missing, chewed
off by a crab, no-one remembers when. We meet wild cats, a whole heap,
scared, ferocious scraps, delving in the rubbish, scrabbling out of the
window over the sink. Big scared eyes, little sharp claws.
And we meet Bob Marley. He is dying.
See Daphne here, she me third cousin twice removed. Means she is kin,
ya know. She bring I'n'I potions, ya know. Herb that heal.
The Blue Mountains of Jamaica hold their legends. In the hills where
bands of runaway slaves fled, led by Nanny, the great Maroon queen, her
myth so great she caught musket balls in her fists, fired by the
invaders from England seizing the island, in 1655, from the Spaniards.
The mountains hold the tomb and the spirit of Bob Marley.
The dream-like landscapes -- the fairest island that eyes have beheld,
Columbus said -- where the land seems to touch the sky. The paradox of
an island so heart-achingly beautiful and so violently abused. Such a
tormented place, so many lives of unremitting misery in a gorgeous,
languorous, scented landscape.
The Spaniards came first in 1494 to wipe out the peace of the Arawak
Indians, bringing disease and sugar, the cursed crop that caused the
first slaves to work the plantations; then it was England's turn to
capture tribesmen from the West Coast of Africa or buy them from the
tribal chiefs for gee-gaws.
Slave revolts, tropical disease, wars, crops lost, people wiped out.
Such a hard, brutal past. And the piratic, rebellious spirit remains on
an island with a history which gives it no right to beauty. Where belief
systems draw on bitter roots. Magic realism blends with obea, local
voodoo, drawing on African animism, interwoven with belief in a God who
blessed and cursed the island in equal measure.
This island is a paradise and a hell. Bob Marley embodies its history.
He is an icon. To Western audiences he was first a novelty for jaded
musical tastes then a reggae superstar. To the Third World he was a
Messianic figure.
His end was sad. He collapsed jogging in New York's Central Park in
October 1980, and they found cancer eating at his brain. His dreadlocks,
symbol of the Rastafarian religion that defined him, fell out, like a
portent, they thought. His wife Rita saved the locks. Had them woven
into a wig. They buried him in it, with his Bible and his guitar.
Bob Marley felt alien. It was one of the stories of his life. He was
black and he was white. From the sense of never belonging, from the pain
of abandonment, came some of the force for his music. It was, for him, a
liberating force.
They took his shrivelled body, nearly a million Jamaicans, walking
dusty miles, on a searingly hot day, back to Nine Miles, to a mausoleum
in the hilly parish of St Annes, deep in the interior, almost as high
above sea level as Blue Mountain peak, the island's highest point at
7402 ft. It is landlocked, temperate, cool, less oppressive than the
marshy plains in the south. It was there he was born.
Cedella Malcolm was 17. The Malcolms were the oldest most respected
family in St Anne's. Her grandfather descended from the Cromanty slaves,
shipped from the Gold Coast some 250 years before.
One day Norval Manley, a White Jamaican, rode his horse into the
cluster of huts. He was working for the colonial government to persuade
locals to farm or settle in the vast acres of uncultivated bush.
He was 50 and he had appetites and one was for a 17-year-old girl with
smooth black skin. He made her pregnant. Marley married Cedella and left
next day for Kingston, abandoning his wife and unborn son.
The boy was often shunned. The same people who had spat at Cedella for
carrying a white man's child, now teased him and called him half-caste.
And worse -- said he was a white man with no place there among them.
Cedella took the boy to Kingston when he was 12, to a new housing
scheme called Trench Town, built over a ditch that drained the city's
sewerage system.
The boy grew up gawky, confused, with so many unanswered questions.
Why did he not see his father? Why was he cursed with light skin? It was
the evidence of alien white blood flowing in his veins. So much moving
around from place to place. So many leavings.
His mother left for the United States when he was 15 and he was alone
in the shanty town. Timid one moment, a screwface ghetto youth the next.
He grew older with a frown and a street handle: Tough Gong. He had to
show them he was tough so they would let him survive.
The music made around fires burning through the night with friends
coming through the shadows to join in outdoor sessions shaped Bob
Marley. Listen to No Woman, No Cry and you hear the stories of those
starlit nights.
He never did join the rude boys, the violent disenfranchised youth who
carried knives, because he was always felt apart. But he understood
them.
The boy was a loner, turned inwards, trusting in no-one but himself.
In music he found an escape from his own pain and hope of escape from
dirt poor life.
When Chris Blackwell, a white Jamaican, founder of Island Records, had
taken Marley on, he signed over to him the small colonial mansion at 56
Hope Road. It became the recording studio of Marley's Tuff Gong, and a
haven for all the drifters and no-hopers and those with nothing but
their blood link to Marley to sustain them.
And that's where we found him, in a fug of ganja, desperately sick,
small and dying, with the head of a proud but wounded lion.
T'ing make me vex yunno? All da people cyaan come together . . . but,
raas, dese people come like a tief in the night, a tief in the night and
steal . . . and mash up people wit' guns and . . . yunno . . .
He was by then billed as the first Third World superstar.  He
was a lot of different things to different people.  Hard to say what he
was to himself.
The sun was slipping behind Long Mountain. In a few months Marley
would be gone. When they buried him with honours in his mountains,
amidst the scent of frangipani and the sweet clouds of ganja the
plaintive sound of his Redemption Song would fill the air:
Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom
Cause they're all I ever had, redemption songs
All I ever had, redemption songs.
These songs of freedom, songs of freedom.

The Church of Scotland is about to get a new guide to procedure,
flavoured with a sprinkling of pawkiness. Ebenezer Erskine reports
AS WISDEN is to cricket, so is Cox to the Kirk. Cox is a book, but he
was originally a person. The Rev James Cox, to be exact -- former
minister of Dyce and sometime Principal Clerk of the Kirk's General
Assembly. In the aftermath of the great reunion of 1929 when the streams
of Presbyterianism, which had divided in the nineteenth century, flowed
together once more, there was a good deal of divergence between the
traditions in matters of procedure and church law. A law book was needed
which would navigate these uncharted waters, and James Cox provided it
in 1934.
From then until the present day, Cox bestrode the world of Kirk law
like a colossus, fathering six editions upon a church which breeds
session-room lawyers (the ecclesiastical version of barrack-room
lawyers). The Very Rev Andrew Herron, former Presbytery Clerk of Glasgow
and Moderator of the General Assembly, has always nursed an ambition to
bring out a book which would take Kirk law into the next century (for
there are many who think it has not yet arrived in this century when
they witness people taking part in archaic rituals such as paying a
shilling to register their dissent at some decision).
Originally Dr Herron's idea was to write a new book which would not
contain the obscure footnotes of the post-1929 situation which have less
relevance today, and supplement this with a loose-leaf volume of laws
which could be updated by offprints from the Assembly Blue Book as
things changed. He thought he had his chance 12 years ago but the
Principal Clerk, James Weatherhead, took matters into his own hands.
When nothing came of this, Andrew Herron produced a series of popular
guides to procedure for congregations and presbyteries which were
published by the Kirk's own publishing house, St Andrew Press.
These are now out of print. As 20 years have elapsed since the last
edition of Cox (editor: D F M Macdonald) things could have become a bit
muddled. However, we bring you good news. Cox is dead but long live Cox!
The Colossus has done the splits and his shoes have been filled by Dr
Herron and Dr Weatherhead in their own inimitable ways.
Readers may recall that we told you last year that Dr Weatherhead
proposed his own green book, the loose-leaf law compendium for the Kirk
since 1929. For his part, Dr Herron has worked ''like a Trojan'' for the
past year and has produced a 400-page, 14-chapter volume which will
supplement and interpret the loose-leaf volume.
Andrew Herron is careful not to claim the status of Cox. He says his
book is a guide. ''A guide tells you not only where you will find a
landmark but also something of its history. I hope I will be able to
clothe the bare bones of legality with some kind of human tissue. Some
parts are intended as a commentary and I have not shrunk from commenting
(sometimes adversely on some aspect of a particular statute) but I have
made it perfectly clear the views are my own.''
Where Dr Herron is concerned that usually means a mixture of canny
conservatism and pawky wit. He is scornful of one recent piece of Kirk
legislation which will limit membership of presbyteries and the Assembly
to ministers and elders beneath the age of 75. At 85, he is a decade
past what he calls his ''sell-by date'' but the legislation will not
apply to those like him who are already retired.
His hands have seldom been idle since his nominal retiral. Preaching
and writing have kept him more than busy.
The product of his Trojan efforts will be called The Law and Practice
of the Kirk: a Guide and Commentary and has a foreward by Lord Davidson,
chairman of the Scots Law Commission. It is a return compliment for Dr
H's co-operation in The Laws of Scotland, a recent update of the Stair
Memorial Encylopaedia on the law as it affects churches and other
religious bodies.
Dr Herron's own book will appear in late March, distributed by
Pickering and Inglis. As a former proof-reader in the Glasgow Herald in
his student days, he was fastidious about the typeface to be used. Those
who have noted his scepticism over ecumenical matters will be interested
to know that he has chosen a Roman face.
While all this may upstage Dr Weatherhead's green loose-leaf book, the
Principal Clerk has a few tricks of his own up his sleeve. He has just
made the General Assembly a hi-tech area. The shorthand writers are to
be replaced by a CD machine which will produce a verbatim record which
is exactly that. PC terminals will enable the officials to download
their minutes of proceedings to the printers and talk to each other
without moving their lips. One wonders what Cox would have thought of it
all.
Since Dr W has announced his retirement he will only have one Assembly
left in which play with these toys in the ''playpen''. Rumour has it
that he will slip quietly upstairs to be Dean of the Chapel Royal when
Dr Bill Morris automatically retires from that post when he attains 70
in August. His successor as Principal Clerk is most likely to be the
part-time deputy, the Rev Dr Finlay MacDonald of Jordanhill Parish
Church.
We would like to be able to tell you more about this excellent chap
but we have fallen victim to the march of new technology and have to
inform you that this is our last column. We know how Cox must be
feeling. Herron today -- gone tomorrow.

JOURNALS 1982-1986 By Anthony Powell Heinemann, #20 (pp 305)
THE privileged world of Anthony Powell (Eton and Oxford and all that)
is memorably described in his 12-novel sequence, A Dance to the Music of
Time (1951-75), and in his memoirs, To Keep the Ball Rolling (1976-82).
To keep the ball rolling when he found it difficult to concentrate on a
new novel in 1982, Powell decided to keep a detaled journal for the
first time in a long life that began in London in 1905.
As he struggled with O, How the Wheel Becomes It! (1983) in March
1982, Powell felt burdened by ''the sluggish imagination of old age''.
Turning from fiction to fact he read of the death of an old
acquaintance, Rab Butler, then attended the funeral of an old friend,
Arthur Perry. A sad occasion, for Perry was not only a neighbour of
Powell -- who has lived in The Chantry, near Frome in Somerset, since
1952 -- and ''one of the nicest of men'' but also a model for Mr
Gauntlett in A Dance to the Music of Time. The music of time seemed to
be coming to a dying close
A day after the funeral, however, Powell optimistically changed his
tune when (Saturday, March 13) ''Tristram gave a party at The Stables
for V's seventieth birthday.'' Tristram is Powell's son. The Stables is
a converted house in the garden of The Chantry. V is Powell's wife
Violet, sister of Lord Longford (who annoys Powell by claiming to be
both Widmerpool and Erridge in A Dance to the Music of Time). You need
to know these things to keep up with the Powells.
You need to know that when Powell drops the name of Percy Somerset he
means Percy, Duke of Somerset. And when he drops the name of Henry Bath
he means Henry Marquess of Bath. Both Percy and Henry were guests at
Tristram's party in The Stables. Percy, Powell (Tony to his chums)
learned, once ''burped the National Anthem without being at all pressed
to do so''.
As for Henry: ''Henry Bath has now given up drink, and although he is
quite compos, talking to him is a little as one imagines talking to
Lazarus immediately after return from the Dead; perfectly all right,
just a touch of needing to get used to an already forgotten condition.''
Powell, a classy rather than a classic writer, likes a touch of class in
his life.
In 1984 he was pleased to attend a Royal Academy dinner as he could
get a close look at the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Prince was
''perhaps a little sad'', the Princess ''prettier than I expected''.
Sitting to the left of the Princess was Laurie Lee. Having already come
to the conclusion that Lee's work was ''utterly unreadable'', Powell was
shocked when Lee made ''an absolute fiasco'' of a speech: ''What the
unfortunate Princess felt about this embarrassing interlude cannot be
imagined.'' Still, he imagined she was ''resigned to an awful evening
anyway''. Powell clearly considered he, unlike Lee, could have made a
speech fit for a Princess.
It is not necessary to have a title to earn Powell's admiration.
Before she became a Lady, Margaret Thatcher appealed to him. In 1985 he
found himself sitting to the right of the Prime Minister at a dinner
party in Downing Street: ''I continue to find Mrs Thatcher very
attractive physically . . . She was wearing a black dress, the collar
rolled up behind her neck, some sort of gold pattern on it. On her right
hand was a large Victorian ring, dark red, in an elaborate gold
setting.'' If Maggie had not existed in fact, Powell would surely have
created her in fiction.
When he talked to V S Naipaul about Maggie's Falklands War, Powell
agreed with his fellow novelist that ''the Argentines . . . are vain,
aggressive, not amenable to anything but force'' -- a generalistion so
sweeping it sounds more like fiction than fact. Sounds like part of a
plot.
Powell is quick to spot a plot. Invited to support an Orwell Prize he
refused because, he reckoned, the project could end up ''by being
Communist''. Powell is always sure he is right. Sure, for example, that
if Orwell had lived to see Maggie in power ''he would have been
anti-CND, pro-Falklands Campaign . . . and in favour of certain other
policies of the Right''. Though Powell knew Orwell (''George and I were
once talking about the Spanish Civil War'') he could be wrong about a
writer not known to toady to the English establishment.
Before this book ends with the author being made a Companion of
Honour, Powell claims, in a witty discussion of Joyce, that the genius
has a ''conviction of his own absolute rightness in everything''. As
this provocatively entertaining book demonstrates, you don't have to be
a genius or a Joyce to have such conviction.

''YOU can never have too many shoes and handbags,'' said the
outrageous Patsy in the TV series Absolutely Fabulous. The same could be
said of the versatile scarf which is seen as such a fashion statement
these days that Liberty Brand Products, an offshoot of the famous
company Liberty of London, asked textile students at the Glasgow School
of Art to submit designs for one of their exclusive scarf collections.
Richard Stewart-Liberty, head of LBP and a descendent of the company's
founder, was so impressed with the results that three students were
awarded generous design fees, the department of printed and woven
textiles got a much-needed injection of cash, and the winning entries
will go on sale later this year -- possibly on a world-wide basis.
As a spokeswoman for the company explained: ''Liberty brand products
are being sold, not just at our 20 or so Liberty shops, but at selected
outlets elsewhere in Britain. We also have agents in places like the
United States, Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan.''
So it's very likely that the Glasgow School of Art designs which will
carry a special GSA tag, will be on sale throughout the world, at prices
ranging from just under #100 to an ''absolutely fabulous'' #250 each.
Said Lindsay Taylor, head of the department of printed and woven
textiles: ''Many of the companies who approach us every year with ideas
for competitions are basically looking for designs on the cheap. We have
to be very careful, therefore, to choose only those projects which fit
in with the curriculum and have an educational outcome.
''Liberty is an enlightened and prestigious company and the scarf
competition was an ideal one for us. In fact, we are hoping they will
involve us in a similar project next year.''
Meanwhile, the new Liberty's company revealed that as well as the
scarves, they are also bringing out a range of stylish frock coats,
hats, and slippers, all in luxurious printed velvet.

BREAKING seasonal colour codes can be the perfect way to beat the
mind-numbing January blues. Winter fashions already come in
traditionally spring colours like pinks, lilacs, and yellows and the day
can be lightened just a bit by pampering the grey skies with a bit of
pastel power.
The paler shades in the purple spectrum are reputed to be particularly
beneficial to a depressed state of mind.
Even if you're not actually suffering from the now medically accepted
Seasonal Affected Disorder which is triggered by the shortage of
sunlight, a little colour therapy might brighten up life a little.
Adding a touch of orange or gold with its peaceful vibes or red to
enliven the atmosphere completes your escape from sobering hues. It also
allows those of us who thought ourselves best in primary colours to
experiment a little.
Make-up to complement softer colours is best subtle and matt.
Blusher in particular has to be carefully chosen and probably mixed
with a little foundation to give a natural warmth that blends with the
pastel whether it is mauve, lilac, lavender, or a soft beige pink.
At this time of the year foundation has the additional benefit of
protecting your skin from the elements, especially the new formulations
which are enriched with ingredients normally confined to sophisticated
skin creams.
The textures are now so refined that they can be used lightly over the
face but a little bit heavier on the cheeks where there are fewer
sebaceous glands and the skin tends to dry out more quickly. Carefully
applied it can also do the work of a concealer hiding blemishes
including broken veins.
Some make-up experts take this a step further and suggest using two
foundations from the same source, a light base to be used all over and a
more heavily textured one in the same shade to cover imperfections. It
can achieve a more natural look than using green or white colour
correctors.
Yves Saint Laurent's latest look, available in a few weeks, keeps the
complexion matt with their treatment foundation Teint Spontane (#22) in
Caramel, cheeks are tinted with Touche Soleil (#17.50).
Orange Madras shadow was applied in the eye crease and the lids
coloured with a smokey shade, Mauve Sarong, from their Eyeshadow Powder
Duo (#18). Mascara, #11.50, is in mauve.
Vibrant colour was kept for the lips, Noble Red, #14.50, a burnished
burgundy that emphasises the delicacy of the lilac background.

Michael Tumelty on classic widows, those keepers of their old flames,
who wielded iron batons and would never let dust settle on the fame of
late and great composers
HISTORY, you might think, takes appropriate care of composers'
reputations after their death: if they were any good in the first place
their music will survive; if naff, not.
Sometimes, however, history needs a hand. And that hand, as often as
not, has belonged to the widow of the composer, the self-appointed
keeper of the flame.
The phenomenon, as it applies to the widows of four contemporary
composers -- Sir William Walton, Bernard Stevens, Benjamin Frankel and
Humphrey Searle -- is about to be explored in Classic Widows, a South
Bank Show documentary made by Ken Russell, former enfant terrible of the
British film industry, here in relatively restrained mode.
The four widows in question are motivated partly by rage at an
establishment which lost interest in their husbands' music the moment
they died, mostly by devotion and an unshakeable belief in the value of
that music (which is heard throughout the programme).
All very honourable. But not all classic widows have basked in the
light of worthiness. Constanze, the widow of Mozart, has had a bad press
for over a century. She has been portrayed as a brainless sex kitten by
her detractors. As recently as the 1970s it was being stated that she
was pushy and fully occupied in an affair with one of Mozart's pupils
who, it has been alleged, was the real father of Constanze's youngest
son.
Sure, when Mozart died in 1791, Constanze -- who was only 28 -- was
hysterical, to the point that she crawled into bed with the body to try
and catch whatever it was that had killed him. Her cardinal sin, for
which she has been vilified, came when she got out of bed.
Though Mozart had earned a fair amount of money during his lifetime,
he had spent it freely, and Constanze's principal inheritance was
considerable debt.
Along with the debts, however, she also inherited her husband's
unpublished manuscripts, which she promptly set about selling. And
history has never forgiven her for this ruthless, mercenary behaviour.
Only recently have attempts to vindicate Constanze, and to reassess her
character and reputation, begun in earnest.
Still, in terms of sheer notoriety, Constanze has a way to go before
she achieves the legendary status of Cosima, widow of Richard Wagner,
who built a dynastic empire out of a real-life legend.
Cosima had an incredible life. She was the daughter of the great
virtuoso pianist and composer Franz Liszt who, along with Wagner, was a
member of the avant-garde in nineteenth-century Germany.
One of the devoted champions of their music was the pianist and
conductor Hans von Bulow. Hans married Cosima and introduced her to
Wagner. She rapidly became obsessed with the composer.
And while von Bulow was doing the business with Wagner's revolutionary
operas (conducting the premieres of Tristan and Isolde and The
Mastersingers) his wife, Cosima, was also doing the business, taking
care of Wagner's more fleshly needs.
Cosima and Wagner eventually married and pursued together the founding
of his dream palace, the Bayreuth Theatre, a temple in which to house a
festival of his own works.
After Wagner died in 1883, Cosima -- who survived him by 47 years --
not only became keeper of the flame; she kept it to herself. She not so
much preserved as embalmed the performing tradition of her husband's
operas. It was a bit like keeping the corpse in the living room.
Even after she retired in 1906 and passed the administration to her
son, it was generally felt that she continued to exert a stultifying
influence over the style of the opera productions.
Unfortunately for her reputation, she also aligned herself with
developing Nazi idealogies (in due course the entire Wagner/Bayreuth
caboodle was annexed by Hitler and taken under his personal protection).
Only six months ago, in his autobiography, did Wolfgang Wagner --
Cosima's grandson and director of the Bayreuth festival since 1966 --
finally state clearly that the composer's widow had ''distorted the
artistic idea underlying the festival with a political ideaology'' and
that her ''nationalistic idealogising of Bayreuth had a disastrous
effect''. Sure did.
The irony is that Wagner's flame was inextinguishable anyway: his
musical and theatrical revolution was so radical, so profound, that it
would have survived and flourished under any circumstances.
The music of Kurt Weill, on the other hand, did need a bit of a leg up
-- thanks to the composer's own indifference. ''I write for today,''
said Weill in 1940. ''I don't give a damn about posterity.''
Fortunately, Weill's widow, the chanteuse Lotte Lenya, was persuaded
to give a damn. She was coaxed back to Europe from the States, back into
the recording studios, and back into her career as a singing actress in
order to revive the music and reputation of her late husband.
Which she did, with a 1956 recording of his theatre songs. She then
tirelessly devoted her time to organising the manuscripts in her legacy,
establishing the Kurt Weill Foundation to propagate his music, and
defining, through her recordings, the performing style for his music --
still reflected today in the work of contemporary champions such as Ute
Lemper.
Lenya died in 1981. Arguably the real Kurt Weill renaissance has yet
to arrive. If it ever does, the seminal work of this classic widow will
have provided the bedrock.

''I FEEL like Cinderella at the ball; isn't this (dress) beautiful?''
said the model as she stood in the middle of a Georgian salon wearing a
carpet! Resplendent in the finest Axminster, hooped petticoats,
feathers, and a muslin-swathed decolletage, she might have just stepped
out of a Gainsborough painting, but the corset was the giveaway to the
author of this amusing folly. It has the unmistakable signature of
Britain's leading fashion designer Vivienne Westwood.
It was Brintons, the 200-year-old carpet manufacturer's idea to
fashion clothing out of wall-to-wall Axminster and Wilton for a special
promotional wheeze with Vivienne Westwood in 1993. It was one of the
most talked about national advertising campaigns of the year. That first
campaign focused on Westwood's tailoring, the new one picks its theme
from the designer's recent catwalk costume cavalcade.
The late eighteenth century is her favourite period of history -- the
French Revolution, the end of the American War of Indpendence, the
expansion of the British Empire, and a new extravagance of dress have
had a remarkable influence on her spring fashion collection. Happily the
era coincides with the founding of Brintons, still a family owned
business.
Actress Saffron Burrows and Westwood's husband and business partner
Andreas Kronthaler are the Gainsborough and Regency buck who model
Westwood's period designs of luxurious ball gown and frock coat for the
new campaign shot by David Bailey. But why button up models in something
people would normally put on their sitting room floor?
Brintons say it was a desire to heighten awareness of their name and
what better way to do that than link it with the ex-queen of punk and
former Designer of the Year, Vivienne Westwood? The reason, explains the
company spokeswoman, is that, ''She is a top-quality designer and one
who is bold enough to do it.''
Certainly the previous campaign reaped results with two of the carpets
used now gracing the floorboards of Hillary Clinton's White House office
and Boris Yeltsin's private office in Moscow.
Of course, Westwood stands to gain considerably from this venture and,
frankly, she has never shied away from publicity even if her name is not
on the billboards. Although an international name, she does not have the
advertising budget that some of the top European designers have at their
fingertips. ''I did it because of the carpets themselves; not only
because of the quality of make and the quality of design, but also their
versatility,'' explains Westwood.
''People recognised them as my clothes when they see them, even when
my name is not attached. The more graphic silhouette is unmistakably
ours.''

A SURGEON who allowed a nurse to cut out a patient's appendix is to
keep his job, it was announced yesterday.
Mr Tahir Bhatti, who had overseen the operation at Treliske Hospital,
Truro, Cornwall, was reprimanded by his employers, South and West
Regional Health Authority.
He will now return to work at the hospital. The authority said his
training would include inter-professional working and delegation of
tasks to non-medical staff.
The decision was announced at a news conference in Winchester
following consideration of an investigative report by the Royal Cornwall
Hospital Trust into the incident involving a theatre nurse, Sister
Valerie Tomlinson, 53.
The authority will be forwarding a report on the incident to the
General Medical Council.
Mr Bhatti -- on paid-leave since the matter became public -- said in a
statement: ''I agree with the findings and accept the decision of my
employer, the South and West Regional Health Authority.
''I did delegate certain steps of the operation to Sister Tomlinson
which I accept were inappropriate.
''I must emphasise that although Sister Tomlinson did carry out
certain steps during the procedure, I performed the more vital and
important parts of the operation.
''I realise this incident has caused a lot of concern and I intend to
ensure that I am never involved in anything of this nature again.''
Mr Bhatti, who qualified in Karachi in 1984, was described as a very
experienced registrar who had been a surgeon for about nine years.
A spokeswoman for the Royal College of Nursing said: ''The RCN feels
it was right that Mr Bhatti should be called to account for his part in
the incident.
''The RCN hopes that the matter will now be allowed to rest, with all
concerned getting back to work away from the media spotlight.''
Sister Tomlinson was given a written warning last month and has
returned to work.

A STRIPTEASE club hostess was found guilty yesterday of blackmailing
an embarrassed schoolboy into paying #144 for a can of cola.
Claire Malone, 20, threatened to shame the 16-year-old by telling his
parents where he had been. The boy was frogmarched to a bank and forced
to hand over a total of #144, the Old Bailey heard.
The boy, who cannot be named by order of the judge, had gone to London
from his Surrey home to buy a pornographic film but was lured into a
Soho sex club by Malone.
Dublin-born Malone, of Piccadilly, London, burst into tears in the
dock when the jury convicted her of blackmail.
The court heard Malone had approached the boy as he walked past the
club and told him he could come in for #3. ''I was expecting to see a
striptease or a peep show,'' he told the jury.
He handed over a #10 note and was told that he would be given his
change downstairs. He was shown to a seat for ''the best place'' to see
the show.
''I was there for half an hour and I did not see any show,'' he said.
He was asked if he wanted a drink and ordered a cola which he was told
would cost #4.50.
''I told them to take it out of my change from the entrance fee but
they would not. I handed over another #10 note. The Coke stayed on the
table all the time. I did not touch it.''
When he was asked how old he was, he lied and told the women in the
club he was 18. Suddenly, a bill for more that #500 was produced.
''When I was shown the bill I said 'Bloody hell . . . I'm not going to
pay that'. I stood up to leave and one of the girls put her hand on my
shoulder and pushed me back down.''
The boy was warned that his parents would be told if he did not hand
over the cash.
One woman then searched his rucksack and discovered his bus pass which
had his age written on it. The hostess from the door produced a ''legal
form'' which he was asked to fill in with details of his name and
address.
''They asked if I had a bank account and I told them I did. One of the
women found a #10 note and handed that to the girl on the door.''
He was taken to a bank where he tried to withdraw the money but was
allowed to take out only #114. He handed the money over.
The boy said he was allowed to leave the club after promising to pay
the rest of the money on the following Saturday.
His mother later learned of the trip when she examined his overdrawn
bank account and took him to the local police station to report the
matter.
The judge pointed out that in all the boy had handed over #144 ''and
all you got was a can of Coke''.
He adjourned the case until February 28 for reports.

<HEADLINE>Picasso gets the brush off as gallery thinks etching prints could cause offence</HEADLINE>

A GALLERY has banned an exhibition of Picasso etching prints because
it fears the work could cause offence.
The prints were booked by Highland Printmakers Workshop and Gallery in
Inverness for display in July before organisers knew what they
contained.
Some of the circus-related pictures include male and female nudes.
Mr Andy Bruce, chairman of the gallery board, said he had yet to see
the pictures, but commented: ''Some of Picasso's work in later life was
fairly uninhibited, so we are erring on the side of caution.
''It is not our intention to shock or offend, and in view of the
possible content of some of these pieces we felt it was probably best to
cancel the exhibition.''
Printmakers' director, Mr Adam Sutherland, who once worked with
Picasso's technician in Paris, said: ''There was a combination of
problems about putting these events on at the same time.
''We booked in a Picasso exhibition and a children's exhibition had
been booked for the same time.
''Obviously, it would not have been suitable to have the children's
workshops, although I don't think the Picasso prints were particularly
strong.
''The main issue was that there had been a double booking.
''There would have been two sets of Picasso prints. One was called
Magnificent Cuckold and they were the worrying ones.
''They contained male and female nudes.''
The gallery will now display work by local artists while the
children's workshop takes place.
The exhibition of work by the Spanish anti-fascist painter, who lived
in exile in France while dictator Franco ruled his home-country, was
booked from London's South Bank Centre and is being promoted by the
Highland Regional Council's Leisure and Libraries Department.
It will go ahead in the spring at the St Fergus Gallery in Wick and at
Thurso's Swanson Arts Centre.
Cathy Shankland, spokeswoman for the department, said: ''I do not
think there is anything for the good folk of Caithness to get worried
about.
''We are keen that as many people as possible get a chance to see the
works by this great artist.
''It is a wonderful chance for them to view Picassos locally, and I
expect that many art lovers from Inverness will now get round the ban by
travelling north.''

ANOTHER residential home for the elderly in Strathclyde is to be
closed after local authority concerns about care standards.
Glenpark House, Port Glasgow, opened five years ago by Dr Niqhat Majid
and currently caring for 13 elderly people, is to lose its registration
following accusations of inadequate management, inappropriate care of
incontinent residents, inconsistent feeding, and staff insensitivity.
A regional council sub-committee on community care was told the
proprietor had not arranged for appropriate district nursing advice in
dealing with incontinent residents.
Social work inspectors reported that incontinent residents wore pads,
lay on protective sheets at night, and were placed on commodes at 5am.
This was judged to be inappropriate care practice, more suited to the
needs of staff who had to do the laundry than the needs of residents.
It had also been noted that staff appeared to be loud and patronising
to residents and demonstrated a lack of understanding for engaging with
dementiate residents. Residents with dementia were said to be allowed to
wander about and walk up and down aimlessly in an agitated manner, with
staff claiming this was good exercise.
It was felt by inspectors that catering arrangements were not
consistent, although efforts had been made to improve matters. One
example was of an evening meal where one beefburger and a small amount
of beans was served with bread and butter. One family-sized tin of beans
was used to feed all 13 residents.
Other practices were said to diminish the dignity of residents,
including the wearing of bibs and having milk poured into tea from
communal bottles. The reason given for this was that residents would
drink milk from jugs.
However, of major concern was the proprietor's inability to sustain
suitable managers for acceptable lengths of time. Since the
establishment's registration, it had been without a suitably approved
manager for 44% of the time. The problem seemed to revolve around the
autonomy required by managers and the inappropriate involvement of the
proprietor.
Dr Majid said last night that, as she had not heard of the committee's
decision officially, she could not comment. In the past, however, she
has claimed she has been the victim of ''harassment'' by social work
staff. She now has the option of appealing to the Scottish Secretary.
A council spokesman said arrangements to remove and find new places
for the residents would be carried out as sensitively as possible.
Last year, two residential homes were closed by Strathclyde region
following reports of elderly people being maintained in poor conditions.
Earlier last year, the death of an elderly woman who had been resident
in Glenglova Residential Home, Glasgow, owned by Dr Rada Sarker, led to
a fatal accident inquiry. Sheriff Daniel Convery condemned the home's
regime, stating that that elderly people had been kept like livestock
for money.
In December, the social work department cancelled the registration of
Caldwell House, Uplawmoor, Renfrewshire, owned by Dr Sohair Chaudhry,
following an adverse report by inspectors.

TWO years ago a meteor -- or maybe a depth charge -- crashed into
Richard Alston's life when he was unceremoniously dumped by the company
he had directed -- Rambert Dance Company. The shock waves have since
subsided. For one thing he has his own dance company now, but the
ripples of that unsettling time can be seen in the work he has made for
this, its first company programme.
Lachrymae -- set to Benjamin Britten's variations on a Dowland song --
is plangent with the need to be understood, consoled, through moods that
shift from stormy tempers to vulnerable sorrow. Three couples move
across the stage in a series of close contacts, sometimes nestling into
the scoop of a caring arm, at other times abruptly breaking away as if
the very gentleness exacerbated their inner pain. And yet, overall,
there is this feeling of hunger: a driven desire to be tolerated even in
unattractive moments.
All three couples communicate these nuances with subtlety, and yet
there is no escaping the passion that courses through even the lightest
brush of reassuring fingers.
Movements from Petrushka also deals in notions of contact, only this
time from the standpoint of the isolated outsider. Alston's programme
note connects the work to real events in Nijinsky's life but again one
detects his own recent experiences when Darshan Singh Bhuller prowls and
contorts in spasms of excluded activity while elsewhere on stage chirpy
couples prance about the clockwork business of their dancing lives.
Throughout Bhuller's solos are echoes of Nijinsky's own celebrated
dance -- it lies in the quirk of an arm, the bend of a body. There is
also a powerful image of a man thrashing through invisible layers that
keep him, like a straitjacket, from making an impact on a world he was
once a central part of. Bhuller's performance is febrile with
understanding, his fluid outpouring of anguish is utterly harrowing.
Shadow Realm, a duet to Simon Holt's music, continues a theme of
contact -- perhaps more suffocating than supportive but release comes
with a burst of paprika-hot energy when the whole company kicks up their
heels for Something in the City. Alston has recruited not just a company
of able dancers, but a company that can give vent to an emotional
subtext without ever labouring it. A very promising start to this, his
new enterprise.

RIGHT. Cancel your arrangements for tonight. Go directly to the Royal
Cobcert Hall and buy a ticket for the Royal SNO concert. It's one of the
most fascinating shows of the season -- all of it unfamiliar music, and
something in it for everyone. And some of it, on its first outing last
night at the Usher Hall, was very well played indeed under new principal
guest Alexander Lazarev.
I trust that, second time around tonight, Schnittke's expressionist
Faust Cantata will be more cohesive than it was last night. Overall it
was a bit loose, showing its seams. Lazarev takes a literal, as opposed
to gothic or atmospheric view of the piece, with the result that some of
Schnittke's sensational sound effects rather pass by without being
milked.
This, possibly, explains why the Royal SNO chorus were better at the
more conventional choruses rather than the surreal, dramatic ones. (And
I fear for their audibility in Glasgow, as they will be back in their
original seating.) The soloists -- Philip Salmon as narrator, Paul
Esswood (replacing Michael Chance) as Mephistopheles, and Ulrik Cold as
Faust, are all far too buried in their scores. Heads up chaps.
Sarah Walker, cabaret style on microphone, goes for broke in the
scorching tango climax -- as the band cut loose (what a din) her
amplification should have been turned up. Worth the trip for this number
alone.
But worth it also for the first half, where Lazarev -- with the Royal
SNO in brilliant form -- performed Shostakovich's music from the film
The Gadfly. Some of it is innocuous incidental music, but there are
enough superb pieces -- epic, cartoon, melancholy, romance, it's all
here -- to more than justify the trip. Blazing performance.

GALLOWS humour informs every aspect of this Citizens' production of
Thomas Middleton's tragedy, directed and designed by Philip Prowse.
Ghastly rows of skeletal corpses hang from the rafters -- a singularly
appropriate motif for a play so overshadowed by inevitable death and
disaster.
Obviously, no good will come of the convoluted schemes orchestrated by
the wealthy widow Livia. Having bedded her niece with her brother she
then panders for the Duke of Florence -- thrusting the young bride,
Bianca, into his clutches -- and subsequently seduces the cuckolded
spouse, Leantio.
Characteristically for the Citz, the onstage melodrama is constantly
counterpointed by ironic flourishes; inappropriate music, sarcastic
delivery, and clashing costume styles, with the magnificent Anne Lambton
investing the devious Livia with a camp splendour. Why does anyone trust
a woman dressed as a poor man's Gipsy Rose?
Victoria Scarborough hams up the histrionics of Bianca, a woman
corrupted by adultery, but Lambton, Citz stalwart Anne Myatt, and the
beautifully poised Andrea Hart never miss a beat while Gerard McArthur
as the Duke is terrifyingly chilling. His entrance is built up to a
preposterous degree, a teasing acknowledgment of his status among a
fawning following, but -- mea culpa -- he deserves no less.
The characters are uniformly reprehensible and one can happily revel
in their downfall, a fact Prowse exploits in the final scene where he
cynically simultaneously stages a wedding scene alongside the murder
necessary for the nuptials. The various intrigues come unstuck, of
course, and they all descend, quite literally, into an abyss, with
Lambton languidly pulling on a cigarette beyond the bitter end.
Glorious.

TRADE union leaders campaigning to change the Government's mind over
the proposed closure of Scotland's only resettlement unit for the single
homeless claimed yesterday their alternative plan for its future had
been ignored.
The unit at Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow, which houses 77 men and is run
by the Department of Social Security, is due to close in April 1996.
It has existed for 33 years and houses men who, in most circumstances,
have no option but to sleep rough. As an alternative, a number of
voluntary organisations are being asked to supply 89 beds.
Speaking in Edinburgh Mr Ian Blackwood, vice-president of the National
Union of Civil and Public Servants, which represents staff at the unit,
claimed a plan to build 12 self-contained blocks, each with six bedrooms
and communal facilities on the present site, did not appear to have been
considered.
He said this proposal by Strathkelvin District Council and Civil
Service unions would cost #1.5m compared to the Government's #3.5m, and
would release capital for other projects to assist Scotland's single
homeless.
It was also felt such arrangements would give residents a degree of
mutual support and a feeling of belonging and social responsibility. The
new units could continue to be run by the DSS or by someone else.
They intended to keep up the pressure on the junior Social Security
Minister, Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, over the future of the unit.
The Civil Service trade unions are also trying to gain support in
Parliament to change the Government's proposal in the Jobseekers Bill to
make the provision of funding for the single homeless discretionary
rather than obligatory.

MESHUGAH By Isaac Bashevis Singer; translated by the author and Nili
Wachtel
Hamish Hamilton, #15.99 (pp 232)
I READ this novel while images of the fiftieth anniversary of the
liberation of Auschwitz dominated the front page of every newspaper and
prayers for the dead filled radio and television news bulletins.
Singer's concerns are beyond survival. The randomness of remission
from genocide is obvious from the opening sentence: ''It happened more
than once that someone I thought had died in Hitler's camps suddenly
turned up alive and well.''
The effects of the reunification is as important as individual
survival. Some seem to have become older, American versions of their
Polish selves, though no-one is entirely free, and every once in a while
he nudges a reminder of the enormity of his subject, the awfulness of
the burden. More than usual, he is concerned with external appearances.
Isaac Bashevis Singer is a wonderful writer, who scarcely seems to be
a writer at all in the sense that we understand the individual who is
almost separate from society, at best an observer; rather, Singer's
seems to be a collective approach. He is a storyteller in the
traditional sense, part of a community whose everyday life and
happenings he records and reinterprets for the benefit of successive
generations, preserving their language as an essential part of the
narrative, recording rites and values as naturally as the events
themselves.
Singer was almost 80 and had been awarded the Nobel Prize for
Literature when he began this novel, whose title is a Yiddish word
meaning ''crazy, senseless, insane''. The book was serialised in the New
York Yiddish newspaper Forward between 1981 and 1983, titled Lost Souls.
It is set in the 1950s and narrated by Aaron Greidinger, a writer
whose work is beginning to receive recognition, though he is continually
anxious and seeks reassurance at every turn, the same in his forties as
he was in his twenties, ''lazy, disorganised, immersed in melancholy''.
His parents and members of his family perished in the Holocaust.
In a postscript the co-translator Nili Wachtel surmises that Aaron is
really Singer, who told him he wanted to write a novel about a young
woman who was genuinely in love with an old man and then,
simultaneously, with a middle-aged man.
Aaron acts as a filter for the other characters. Through him, Singer
not only handles the extremes of their personalities and the wonderful
range and complexities of character, but seems to understand them so
well, offering slices of their stories and contradictory actions,
revealing their pasts, and emotions in a way that makes them absolutely
believable and totally convincing.
Max Aberdam turns up in Aaron's office years after Aaron thought he
was dead. Max was a Warsaw patron, glutton, and womaniser, who is now
the Holocaust survivors' financial adviser. He is as overbearing as ever
and takes Aaron on a tour of his elderly customers who listen to Aaron's
Sunday broadcasts and read his serialised novels in Forward.
The tour ends with Max's lover Miriam. At first she appears a
spontaneous, intelligent, young woman but her terrible past is gradually
revealed. For Max, the world is meshugah. Aaron believes we live in an
insane asylum. Miriam says nothing can harm her any more. She obviously
needs both men.
Yet their relationship, the twists, turns, and truth of its
development is only part of the agenda. Singer uses it and the trio's
collective pasts as a springboard into a philosophical exploration of
how god views humanity. If he exists, how does one explain Hitler and
Stalin, unless god himself is meshugah? And if the key lies in freedom
of choice, where is the role of love, since love limits our choices,
though love is identifiable with freedom?
Once again, Singer's urgency, his wonderful questing imagination lifts
the novel beyond itself, raising questions fiction was supposedly too
trivial to bear.
The piles of spectacles, shoes, and human hair are Auschwitz's most
eloquent testament, but in this wonderful novel, Singer shows a panoply
of lost souls whose plight is just as stark and as hopelessly moving.

THE AUTONOMY OF MODERN SCOTLAND
By Lindsay Paterson Edinburgh University Press, #30 (pp 211)
LINDSAY Paterson's central thesis is that Scotland since the Union has
never ceased to exercise a high degree of administrative autonomy, or at
least until the Thatcher Government started to undermine it. The Union
abolished the Scottish Parliament (and according to the Treaty the
English one as well, but no-one took that seriously). Otherwise
everything in Scotland remained much as before, and that included the
Church, the law, and the systems of education and local government.
All of these then affected the lives of the people very much more than
Parliament did, up to the middle of the nineteenth century at least.
Scotland, in the words of Walter Scott, was left ''under the
guardianship of her own institutions to win her silent way to national
wealth and consequence''.
So far, no-one would dispute this proposition, but Paterson takes it
much further and with impressive sophistication and scholarship. He
argues that Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in
contradition to the present, was ''one of the most decentralised states
in Europe.'' The civil society which existed in Scotland before the
Union continued and ensured that ''Scottish autonomy as a whole was
preserved''.
For this reason he says the ''the dominant theme of nineteenth century
Scottish politics was successful nationalism''. Scottish administration
was then exercised through Scottish boards and they, like Scottish
industry, were in Scottish hands. When early in this century the
machinery of government was reformed, it was in the context of
nationalist assumptions. This brought about the transfer of the Scottish
Office to Edinburgh, and the new Scottish state emerged ''in an
atmosphere of consensual Scottish nationalism''.
Paterson supports this argument by comparing the degree of autonomy
enjoyed by Scotland in the last century with Ireland, Hungary, Poland,
and the Czech territories. He concludes that Scotland had more, and not
less, autonomy than any of them. It is perhaps significant that all of
the others have become independent.
In this century he compares Scotland with federal countries in Europe
and North America and again concludes that Scotland does well in the
comparison, with more autonomy, for instance, than the German Lander. It
is true, of course, that the Lander and other federal states have
legislatures; but Paterson contends that the tendency is for them to
leave most legislation to the central parliament.
The weakness of this theory is that it attaches no importance to
democracy. It amounts to suggesting that we should be content with
government by nominated boards, quangos of officals, and that they
should work under the constraints of legislation over which neither they
nor the people as a whole have control. There are passages where
Paterson seems to play down the imperfections of this system.
He variously describes the Union of 1707 as a bargain or a compromise;
but this ignores the circumstances in which it came about with very
little freedom of choice left to the unrepresentative Parliament and
none at all to the people as a whole. He says that both Robert Burns and
Robert Fergusson ''wanted a more complete Union''. This surprises me
because all their recorded statements on the subject express detestation
of the whole affair.
Does this all mean that Paterson is trying to persuade us that we
should be content with the limited freedom which we already have in a
world where all countries have to accept constraints on their freedom of
action? I do not think so. In the first place, he recognises that
Thatcher introduced a new Toryism, ''one that had forgotten a sense of
the Union as a partnership''. Also, ''there has been a decline in
cultural Britishness, as the Empire has gone, as the monarchy has
crumbled into trivial scandal''. Above all, developments in Europe have
changed the whole situation. That is why devolution is not enough. It is
now time for Scotland to assert itself to become a full partner in the
European Union.

WESTERN SWING, by Andrew Greig, Bloodaxe Books, #7.95 (pp 112);
FAMILIAR SPIRITS, by Elizabeth Jennings, Carcanet, #6.95 (pp 64); THE
GREEN BOOK OF POETRY, edited by Ivo Mosley, Frontier Publishing, #8.95
(pp 352).
SCOTTISH poets will be philosophical; and often they will philosophise
about Scotland, known in Andrew Greig's long and interesting poem as The
Debatable Lands -- this country of ''a violent culture/great wilderness
in the heart''. Andrew Greig has read and travelled widely; and much of
this poem is set in the East and much of it has an undercurrent of The
Waste Land, that poem in which Eliot seems to turn to the East after the
West's ''heap of broken images''.
The symbol in this poem is the Dual Knife -- and the sheath -- whose
entire significance I do not fully understand. However, that aside, much
of the poem is wise and vivid as it seeks to find a meaning for life,
particularly in the East and with the help of the Heretical Buddha. The
knife appears in various guises through the poem and seems to be a
''healing blade''. The quest ends in the ''holiness'' of domesticity, in
a routine without divinity. The knife ceases to be symbol and becomes
''a tool for use about the house''.
The poems of Elizabeth Jennings are buttressed by Christianity. She
has a quiet voice to which one has to listen very carefully. Her poems
are nearly always formal and, where they are not, seem diminished.
Familiar Spirits is a punning title since it seems in effect to be the
''spirits'' of the family. She writes about an uncle who encouraged her
early efforts in poetry. She writes about her father's father, and
family bonds, referring to aunts, uncles, and cousins.
In a poignant poem she faces the daunting fact that no one ''cares for
her totally''. She has, of course, her religion, her art, and her
imagination and there is much about the last -- and its frustration by
others -- in this book; as well as meditations on the difference between
love and lust.
Sometimes, too, she has moments of grace. Elizabeth Jennings has been
writing with great emotional honesty and distinction for a long time.
Her voice, as I have said, is reticent and untheatrical. And yet in her
sanity and formal constraint there is much to admire.
We are, of course, living in a time of shifting faith. Andrew Greig
after his ''gypsyings'' finds salvation in the domestic, Elizabeth
Jennings in her Christianity. The Green Book of Poetry is
self-explanatory. It is a marvellous anthology, a cornucopia of fresh
poems, a large number of which I had never encountered before. They come
from all corners of the globe, from East and West. The editor has a
perhaps unfashionable belief in the power of poetry. It is, she writes,
''The last stronghold of the sacred word''. The book is divided into
various sections, Nature, Love, Religion, etc. It would be hard for me
to quote from such prodigious riches, from all countries and from all
epochs. Many of the poems, of course, are in translation but this does
not seem to impede their fresh, optimistic power. This book does in fact
show that great poetry can illuminate and revivify a world broken and
spoilt by careless rapine and lust for profit. Free of dogma, it offers
itself freely, and speaking truthfully will have nothing to do with
chicanery or corruption. This anthology is fresh water in a ravaged
landscape and affirms the life-enhancing sanity of poetry.

TREASON IN THE BLOOD -- H St John Philby, Kim Philby, and the Spy Case
of the Century By Anthony Cave Brown Hale, #25. (pp 677)
WRITING IN the early fifties of William Joyce (''Lord Haw Haw''), the
atom spy Klaus Fuchs, and other notable traitors, Rebecca West said:
''As a divorce sharply recalls what a happy marriage should be, so the
treachery of these men recalled what a nation should be: a shelter where
all talents are generously recognised, all forgivable oddities forgiven,
all viciousness quietly frustrated, and those who lack talent honoured
for equal contributions.''
In other words, imperfect nations -- and there is no other kind --
breed perfect spies. The danger of treason for any state is not that it
demonstrates how weak or greedy humankind can be, but that it signifies
a kind of personal mutiny against the established order. Anyone capable
of being bought can be bought back, but the principled traitor is a
permanent threat: he might be believed and followed.
West was suggesting, it seems, that countries get the treason they
deserve if they fail to create an accommodating society. For the same
reason, no state can afford to countenance a traitor. It is not merely
that he acts for a foreign power; much more important is the fact that
he accuses, by his deeds, his own kind. Anyone who stops to think about
it will realise that it takes a lot to turn an honest man against his
homeland -- one reason, perhaps, why Graham Greene refused to disown Kim
Philby.
Was the Soviet agent of 53 years standing an honest man? Even after
reading Anthony Cave Brown's massive volume it is hard to say. At the
end, an old KGB agent who had known him for 40 years expressed the doubt
that always lingers over traitors. ''I wonder,'' said Yuri Modin,
''whether Kim cheated us as he cheated everyone else?'' Even after all
of Cave Brown's researches, the spy who emerges is, fittingly, an opaque
character.
What is clear is that the unmatched talent of the English
establishment for duplicity and for turning its children against itself
created the perfect conditions for treason. Men who in previous
generations would have been the servants of empire concluded that the
state was rotten and that a better, Communist world was possible. It can
hardly be an accident, in other words, that England has bred so many
turncoats.
The odd thing is that H St John Philby, the senior partner in this
exhaustive dual biography, was the model of an imperial hero. An
unrivalled Arabist, notable explorer, adviser to Ibn Saud, and rival to
Lawrence of Arabia, he could have given Britain a political and
commercial stranglehold on the Middle East. Instead, he became a Moslem,
expressed bitter contempt for his own country, and brokered the deal
that allowed the United States to win the Saudi oil concession, with all
that has meant for the world. As Cave Brown puts it, there was ''treason
in the blood''.
Like father, like son. Kim Philby's work for the KGB made him the most
important spy of his generation, perhaps (the Russians certainly thought
so) one of the ''most important men of the century''. He was a man made
to be disillusioned, first with Britain, subsequently with the USSR.
But unlike so many of that sort he tried, through espionage, to find
his own cure. That it was a remedy poisonous to the entire British state
apparatus bothered him not at all. Philby proved in his own person that
Britain could no longer always command or win loyalty. By rising high in
the service of the crown while holding no brief for the establishment,
the master spy and his fellow traitors proved by their very careers that
something stank at the heart of the state, otherwise men such as
themselves would never have existed. In the continuing obsession with
the Philby case, that fact is too often forgotten.
Cave Brown unravels it all in magisterial, scholarly fashion, with
much new Soviet material, but at a length that allows no proper analysis
here. Your are reminded of James Joyce describing his homeland as
Ireland the sow who eats her farrow. In this tale you are left to wonder
how England became the lion who estranged her cubs.

FROM THE BOER WAR TO THE COLD WAR: Essays on Twentieth-Century Europe
By A J P Taylor
Hamish Hamilton, #25
(pp 454)
THE late Alan Taylor was both a scholar and an entertainer, a
conjunction which some other historians found incongruous, and
disasteful even. They were themselves both jealous and wrong, a much
worse combination.
As a historian he enjoyed immense powers, being able to unite analysis
and narrative in a highly readable style. Works such as English History
1914-45 and The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918 remain major
scholarly achievements, remarkable at once for their style and their
judgments.
For one who took such pleasure in apparent mischief, his judgment was
nearly always sound, though he occasionally wavered on detail. (A quick
example might be Jutland where he was absolutely right as to the outcome
-- a British victory -- but wrong in thinking the German High Seas Fleet
never thereafter put to sea: it did so three times.)
As entertainer he was able to present history in striking and original
words which proved to be perfectly suited to television where he was
able to speak in the most telling way without the benefit of a prepared
script. He became the first TV guru, though he never used the pictorial
paraphernalia available to the likes of David Attenborough. Apart from
the odd map, he tended to be a talking head, which is thought by the
makers of TV programmes to be a recipe for disaster. He was one of a
small band who disproved them.
He must have polished his writing, and he loved the way its terseness
lent itself to aphorism and paradox which stimulate readers, sometimes
making them laugh, no small feat given his normal suject matter. He was
most telling when laconic. Long sentences, with several subordinate
clauses, might have lost his audiences; one on Lansdowne (on page 80)
lost its cohesion.
This collection of essays and book reviews shows him at his best. He
was brilliant (the mot juste indeed in his case) about putting people
into nutshells, yet, in spite of his self-confidence, seldom dogmatic. A
good case in point is Lord Milner whom he disliked and summed up
harshly, though not I think unfairly, in ''The Man of No Luck'' the
sixth of these pieces. He added, however, that several others whose
opinions he respected had come to very different conclusions about the
man. And that is a test of his fairness.
He never allowed his verbal flights to affect his assessments. His
portrait of General Smuts, reviewing Hancock's biography, has fine
insights including his noticing the constitutional rarity of Smuts being
in the War Cabinet without membership of either House of Parliament.
Taylor was pre-eminently a historian of diplomacy, politics, and war,
but, as English History demonstrated, the broadest canvas did not reduce
his vivid presentational skills. Yet he covered such wide areas that he
was sometimes bound to fail.
His knowledge of South African history, for example, as shown here was
limited to the political and imperial arenas, and possibly by his
sympathies for the majority.
His notion, however, that Afrikaners pursued an exclusionist racial
policy in the era of the Boer War and later, though long fashionable, is
far too simplistic, and signally fails to explain, for example, why a
majority of the Cape Coloured population voted for the Afrikaner party
in their country's first free and colour-blind elections last year.
Taylor had a philosophy of history which was quite bleak: we
experience it more than we make it. Explaining it is difficult: ''things
happen because they happen''. The clutch of essays, ''War by
Time-Table'', on the opening of the First World War, offers a wonderful
commentary on that opinion, showing how Europe blundered into the first
of its two civil wars this century in spite of no one actually wanting
such an outcome.
Some Scots preferred not to enjoy Taylor's work because he was an
English nationalist who insisted on calling Scots Scotch because he knew
it was resented. Why it is resented is something of a mystery -- and of
quite recent development -- but it is as irrelevant to the quality of
his writing as the fact that although rather well off he was extremely
mean.

DRUG addiction is spreading at one of Britain's biggest women's

in a report about to be published by the Chief Inspector of Prisons,
Judge Stephen Tumim. His study criticises the lack of treatment and
counselling for addicts and shows that the drugs problem is as serious
in women's jails as it is in men's, according to a report on BBC
Breakfast News. Judge Tumim, who carried out an inspection last summer,
says women enter the prison as shoplifters and leave it as drug addicts.

THE standard four-day training course, which every offshore worker
must take, is to be cut to two days by the Offshore Petroleum Industry
Training Board, as revealed by The Herald in October.
Although some unions have said they are happy with the move, others
within the industry have expressed reservations.
The change comes at a time when oil companies are striving to cut
costs by at least 30%, but the United Kingdom Offshore Operators'
Association, which drew up the new guidelines, insists that cost-cutting
is not the motivation.
Yesterday Opito announced that its joint industry review of the basic
offshore safety induction and emergency training standards had been
completed and approved.
It said that the cut, from four to two days, would lead to a more
focused approach to the training of personnel in basic safety aspects of
travel and work offshore.
''The new standard is more practically based whereas the earlier
standard contained more theoretical training,''' it said.
''In addition, the number of trainees on each course will be reduced
from 24 to 16. This improved course time management will result in
participants spending less time waiting to complete practical exercises.
''All the key elements of offshore survival training, in particular
the practical helicopter escape training, are fully retained in the new
approach.''
Mr John Ramsay, Opito's chief executive, said: ''This new standard is
better directed towards meeting current industry requirements. It is
part of a broader, more cohesive approach to ensure new entrants to the
industry have the relevant safety and survival skills.''
Last night an observer of the offshore safety regime told The Herald:
''This is something the operators have been trying to achieve since
before Piper Alpha.
''Every time there is a major incident, going right back to the Ocean
Ranger, there is a flurry of activity on the safety and survival front.
Unfortunately that is not maintained, particularly if there are
financial pressures on the companies.''
Mr Joe Cross, who will shortly retire as managing director of RGIT
Ltd, which has run the courses throughout the life of the oil and gas
industry in the UK, said that it still had a number of concerns about
the content of the courses and this had been made known to Opito without
result.

The convener of Highland Regional Council, Mr Duncan McPherson, will

Mr McPherson has booked every available berth on the Fort William
London sleeper on Tuesday, a service which is due to be axed on May 28.
The delegation will meet Highland MPs before sitting in on a debate on
transport at the Scottish Grand Committee.
Mr McPherson had hoped to meet Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney,
but a letter to the him on December 21 remains unheeded.
Mr McPherson said last night: ''Enough is enough. We cannot afford to

A BLACKMAILER threatened to circulate ''pornographic'' love letters
written by his ex-lover's new boyfriend.
According to his victim, Anthony Law, 46, even said he would give
photocopies of the letters to her children's schoolfriends so that they
could take them home to their parents.
Law's jury trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court ended yesterday after he
changed his plea and admitted stealing letters from his ex-lover's home
in March last year and writing offensive messages on walls and a mirror.
Law, from the Carrick Knowe area of Edinburgh, also admitted
attempting to extort money and jewellery from the woman by threatening
to send copies of the stolen letters to her family and friends.
The woman, who is separated from her husband and lives in the west of
Edinburgh, told the trial that she had a two-year affair with Law, who
is married, although he did not tell her that at first.
She described how she arrived home with her children one afternoon to
discover an offensive message written in felt pen in 6in-high letters on
her living-room wall.
The word ''bitch'' was also written on her ironing board and a long
mirror in the bedroom had been placed on the bed and written on in
lipstick. The woman found that letters to her from Law had been taken
along with letters from another man.
When asked to describe the content of the letters from the other man,
she said that they were ''personal'' and ''special''. ''To anyone else
they would appear to be pornographic, I think,'' she said.
The woman received a telephone call from Law in which, she claimed, he
said he would hand photocopies of the letters to her neighbours, her
husband, and her children's schoolfriends.
She told the jury he said there was something she could do to prevent
that happening but it took her some time to realise what he was getting
at.
''I said: 'Do you mean that you want me to give you money?' and he
said: 'I think I deserve a little reward'.''
She claimed he said he wanted a decent holiday and mentioned her car
which she reckoned was worth about #8000. The woman added that Law later
suggested that instead she could give him a brooch given to her by her
grandmother which he knew was valued at #6000 to #7000.
''I took him seriously. I was scared. I don't think I really believed
it was happening to me. It took some time to sink in,'' she told the
court.
Depute-fiscal Brian Robertson said Law appeared to be jealous at first
but became more controlled and menacing.
Law, now unemployed and caring for his disabled wife, told police he
phoned the woman ''just to let her know'' that he had the letters.
''The idea of money came to me after speaking to her,'' he said.
''Because of the upset the whole thing had caused me, I think I
suggested a lot of things. It was extremely upsetting.''
Defence counsel Frances McMenamin said Law suspected the woman of
seeing someone else and had ended sexual relations with her.
''There was an obsession with the fact that the woman, when confronted
with the letters, still refused to admit that she was having affairs
with other people,'' said Miss McMenamin.
She added that, when he went to get his letters back and found the
ones from the other man in among them, he changed from an affectionate,
normal person to a ''raging madman''.
Law felt that his wife had been through years of distress because of
his and the other woman's behaviour.
Miss McMenamin said that, during the affair, the other woman had sent
numerous letters to Law's home and had constantly telephoned.
''He simply decided that he had upset the person he really loved for
someone who would not even be honest with him,'' she said.
Sheriff Hazel Aronson deferred sentence until February 28 and called
for social enquiry, psychiatric, and community service reports.

A GUIDE to the best treatment for breast cancer in Scotland is
expected to be available later this year, it was announced yesterday.
The unique publication will offer an assessment of the different
combinations of treatment available rather than the best hospital or
doctor -- a format already available in America, published by Good
Housekeeping magazine.
The breast cancer audit -- based on the outcome for all 5000 breast
cancer patients in the years 1987 and 1993 -- will look at how treatment
regimes have changed in the intervening period, and whether women do
better at specialist centres or general hospitals.
Professor Stan Kaye, of the Beatson Oncology Centre in Glasgow, said:
''We have 97% of the data and the report should be ready in about six
months. It will look not just at whether cancer recurred or not but
other background factors.
''If it indicates that patients do better in one of the four cancer
centres then you have to look at how you can get the specialist
expertise to the district general hospital level.''
Professor Kaye, a member of the Scottish Cancer Therapy Network set up
by the Scottish Office two years ago, was speaking during a visit by the
Scottish Health Minister, Lord Fraser, to the network's headquarters in
Edinburgh.
The Minister was shown how the network helps doctors to recruit
patients to clinical trials -- patients can be assessed in minutes with
the help of a database, cutting out much of the time-consuming paperwork
the clinicians would face otherwise.
The network's purpose is to ensure that best practices in the
treatment of cancer are recognised quickly and applied appropriately
throughout Scotland.
Lord Fraser's visit came as members of a pressure group, the Scottish
Breast Cancer Campaign, were preparing to travel to London on Monday to
deliver a petition with 150,000 signatures to the House of Commons.
The petition calls for increased funding for breast cancer research
and treatment. Seven women in Scotland die of the disease every day.
Lord Fraser yesterday side-stepped questions about the level of
resources for cancer care, but praised doctors for their willingness to
share information with each other, making projects like the breast
cancer audit possible.
Professor Kaye said: ''I believe it is the first national breast
cancer audit of its kind.
''We can collect this kind of data in Scotland because a population of
five million is about the optimum number to cope with and provide
reliable information.''
Lung and colo-rectal cancers are also among the lethal forms of cancer
being evaluated by the network.

A JUDGE'S widow from New York, who says she looks like a young
Katharine Hepburn, is advertising for a Scotsman with the ''old
fashioned values'' lacking in American men.
Mrs Lyla Aubry, 60, who describes herself as ''attractive,
intelligent, and charismatic'' has two conditions for potential
partners. They have to cross the Atlantic at their own expense and take
her some Scottish heather. Already more than 50 Scots have responded.
''My dearest friend, Alexander Monroe Lindsay, was a Scot. He's dead
now but I always remember his qualities. He enjoyed a drink and he had a
well controlled sense of irresponsibility,'' said Mrs Aubry yesterday.
''That's what I am looking for.''
A wealthy real estate broker, she is willing to move to Scotland for
the right man. ''Someone like Spencer Tracy would do nicely,'' she said.
(Tracy played opposite Katharine Hepburn in their 1967 Oscar-winning
film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.) However, her half-Irish husband,
Andrew, who died 18 months ago, looked like James Cagney.
''I had one Scotsman over to see me three times but I can't make up my
mind about him. Another rang yesterday to say he is flying out. Anyone
who measures up can stay at my apartment while we see if we can develop
a friendship,'' said Mrs Aubry.

THE Government was yesterday accused of failing to respond adequately
to a United Nations report expressing concern over the health,
education, and social security needs of the high number of children
living in poverty in Britain.
Scottish Labour's spokesperson on children and their welfare, Mrs
Maria Fyfe, said: ''It's an old media trick, well-known to politicians
and anyone who has frequent dealings with the media. Do not respond and
the story dies.''
However, the Maryhill MP warned the Government that the story would
not be allowed to die. ''There are times when silence is golden. But in
politics silence implies consent, and children who have no votes and no
voices need us to speak up for them.''
Mrs Fyfe, addressing an Edinburgh conference on child services, said
the UN report also referred to domestic laws allowing the use of sticks
and belts to punish children in their own homes and in privately funded
schools.
''We can certainly, I trust, hope to reform a law that allows children
to be injured in the name of lawful chastisement,'' the MP said.

CARDINAL Thomas Winning yesterday became a shepherd of his flock: the
freedom of Motherwell was bestowed on him, meaning he is allowed to lead
a flock of sheep through the town centre.
Nor shall that flock thirst. The freedom allows him to draw water from
the town well without queueing.
MPs, councillors, priests, and representatives of other churches
turned out to honour the cardinal at Motherwell's civic centre.
He was presented with a Freeman's Scroll by Provost William Wilson.
The Freeman Declaration was read out by the council's chief executive,
Mr John Bonomy.
Cardinal Winning is the first person to be given the freedom of
Motherwell in the 20 years that the district council has existed. He is
also likely to be the last: Motherwell district will disappear under
local government changes next year.
Previous freemen, honoured when Motherwell was a burgh, have included
conductor and composer Sir Alexander Gibson, who died recently, and
scientist Sir Samuel Curran.
Provost Wilson said: ''Thomas Winning has always shown a great
interest in his town and a great concern for the people.
''Such an honour is not given lightly and is only considered for
someone of special significance.''
The cardinal is a keen Celtic supporter, and enjoys playing Hawaiian
guitar. Both aspects are illustrated in the Freeman's Scroll, the work
of Lady Avril Watson-Stewart, one of last night's guests.
He was also presented with a wooden box, carved with the Motherwell
district coat of arms and containing CDs of classical music conducted by
Sir Alexander.
Cardinal Winning said: ''When I was in Rome receiving the red hat I
received a great deal of encouragement from the presence of so many
people from this district.
''It's always a pleasure coming back to your home town, and this is a
particularly great pleasure. This unique honour bestowed on me is also
an honour on my family and the Catholic Church.''

<TEXT>
STRATHCLYDE Police have drawn up plans, backed by Chief Constable
Leslie Sharp, to establish ''Trojan houses'' in areas prone to
break-ins.
The houses, which would be manned by officers and rigged with
fibre-optic cameras, were first planned as a part of the recent
Operation Turnkey.
Mr Sharp revealed the plans at a news conference to announce the
success of the operation, which enabled police to reduce break-ins, car
thefts, and recover an ''Aladdin's Cave'' of stolen goods.
He said: ''We've had Trojan vans and Hyena cars, what about a Trojan
house?
''I want to make it so that the house-breaker doesn't know whether the
house is safe to break into or not.''
A police spokesman explained that, if a Trojan house were launched,
criminal intelligence would target an area which had suffered a spate of
break-ins, then surveillance would be set up either inside the house or
from a suitable position outside.
The idea was first formulated during the early stages of planning for
Operation Turnkey, but factors such as manpower resources, costs, and
problems targeting a suitable area stalled its introduction.
The spokesman said: ''It's an ambitious plan which we will keep up our
sleeves and will not hesitate to use if necessary.''
The Chief Constable also talked about the dramatic damage a break-in
could cause to a family.
In 1992, his own home was burgled, vandalised, and daubed with paint
and varnish.
He said: ''We haven't been able to give as much time as we would have
wanted to house break-ins; but it is important because, no matter how
good you are at catching knife crime and firearm crime, when your house
is burgled it is a most dramatic experience and I speak with some
feeling because mine was done. I know the effect it can have on the
whole household.''
Compared with the same 90-day period last year, Operation Turnkey has
meant 2062 fewer break-ins, a reduction of more than 30%, a rise in
detection rate from between 9-11% to 17%, and the arrest of 1363 people.
The sum of stolen property recovered was #1.18m. Fifty thousand people
had their property marked and Mr Sharp appealed for more to do the same.

at the former Napier Polytechnic which is now Napier University.
She graduated in 1988 with a HND in interior design and immediately
began working for McCulloch.
One of the first main projects she was involved with was the Tunnel
Discotheque in Glasgow and she was also involved in work at the
Universe, Coatbridge, Parklands Country Club, and Caledonian University.
She was solely responsible for the design of the new bar in the Tron
Theatre and was recently part of the team working at the Maxaluna pub
and restaurant in Sauchiehall Street.
Some of her best work was carried out across the Irish Sea at the POD,
or Place of Dance, in Dublin.
She became ill last spring while on holiday in America. She is
survived by her parents John and Jean, her brother Graeme and sister
Vivien.

THREE Glasgow MPs have urged the contractors hired to build the M77 on
the South Side of Glasgow to delay their work until a complaint to the
European Commission over a possible breach of environmental law has been
resolved.
A letter has been sent to Wimpey Engineering and Construction by
Glasgow Central MP Mike Watson, Glasgow Pollok MP Jimmy Dunnachie, and
Glasgow Govan MP Ian Davidson claiming that Strathclyde Regional Council
could be in breach of European Union law for failing to conduct an
environmental impact assessment on the motorway proposal.
''As MPs representing constituencies affected by the M77, we are
asking that Wimpey delay construction work until the European Commission
has determined the question and the Secretary of State has had time to
consider the outcome,'' they said.
''If injunction proceedings are issued, Wimpey may be a party to those
proceedings. Furthermore, there is a possibility that, if the contract
is subsequently rescinded as a result of intervention by the European
Commission or the European Court of Justice, Wimpey would not be
successful in bringing a claim for damages against the Secretary of
State as a result of having knowingly entered into the contract while
its validity was still in question.''
Mr Watson said: ''I am dismayed to note that, despite having drawn to
their attention the fact that the EC may prevent this project going
ahead, Wimpey have taken the first steps. While the matter is being
investigated by the UK Government and thereafter by the EC, there should
be a freeze of any work associated with the M77 Ayr road route.''
The head of research for Friends of the Earth (Scotland), Dr Richard
Dixon, added: ''Our complaint to the EC has moved up a gear and it would
be a tragedy if Europe rules in our favour after Wimpey have caused
massive environmental damage. We will not give up. Our opposition to the
M77 will continue on the ground and at the highest level in Europe.''

A UNION leader yesterday attacked the Rolls-Royce management for its
''uncaring, unfeeling, and incompetent'' decision to shut down its
design and development department at East Kilbride with the potential
loss of 600 jobs.
Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing Science and
Finance union, described it as an ill thought-out exercise.
Union officials at East Kilbride claim that the plant is one of the
most profitable sections of the company, and that the closure does not
make economic sense.
Mr Lyons, whose union represents the majority of the workers facing
the sack, was barred by management from holding a meeting within the
plant. East Kilbride District Council, which is backing the fight to
save the plant, gave Mr Lyons use of council premises to hold a news
conference.
He claimed that Rolls-Royce management in England were worried that
local management in East Kilbride would have spoken out against the
closure decision.
Next week union officials from the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions will be meeting Rolls-Royce board members and will be
demanding a reversal of what Mr Lyons described as a ''crazy,
scorched-earth policy''.
Union officials at East Kilbride are also planning to visit Germany to
talk to union officials at BRR, the company set up by Rolls-Royce and
BMW to run a sister plant near Berlin.

for a gap site opposite Glasgow Green.
The housing development, which will eventually be built by a
partnership of Scottish Homes and a private developer, is on land owned
by Glasgow Development Agency around McNeill Street and between Ballater
Street and the River Clyde.
Of 169 applications to the competition, 60 entries were submitted, all
of them judged blind. Four of the six short-leeted were Glasgow
companies -- Cooper Cromar, Ken Findlay and William Cooper, John Gilbert
and Ashley Hunt of NJSR.
Alongside two London entries, from Bob Allies of Allies and Morrison,
and from Mark Fisher and Charles Bearman, the plans will now be further
judged in May.

Winter wonderland: the surroundings at the People's Palace are
delightful, the service is friendly but even that can't take the chill
off the place.
LIKE many Glaswegians I have visited Kelvingrove since childhood and
feel very sentimental, dragging visiting friends and relations around
it, but taking care never to eat there. My memories of eating in the two
cafes, which are now replaced by the newer one, were plastic chairs,
iced buns, and dull sandwiches. I hoped for a different experience this
time.
The new Cafe at Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery is run by the local
authority caterers and is situated in a large airy room, with tall
windows, polished wooden floors, and a host of interesting sculptures.
When I visited it the cafe was very busy. Most diners appeared to be
visiting the museum as coats and hats were being carried rather than
worn. There was an ample supply of chairs and tables, which at lunchtime
is either a bonus or a bad omen. In this case it proved to be the
latter.
The choice was not very large and most of the food on the servery did
not appear appetising. The salads looked dried-up and tired, the quiche
platters full of condensation under their clingfilm, and the choice of
sandwiches crushingly dull -- cheese and onion, honey-roast ham, and
roast beef with French mustard.
Things got off to a bad start. Just as I was being served my bowl of
potato and leek soup, a dissatisfied customer was returning hers,
protesting that it was nothing but ''hot water with a few leeks thrown
in''! There were a lot of leeks in my soup, but no trace of potato. It
was very salty -- a few spoonfuls and I was reaching for my glass of
water. It was without a doubt the worst soup I have ever been served.
There was a limited choice of main meals. The two daily specials were
rigatoni primavera and roast pork in apple sauce.
I chose the pasta and regretted it. The pasta was very hot and covered
in bubbling mozzarella; it was so hot that it was difficult to
distinguish any taste. It was served with sauted potatos and carrots.
The potatoes hadn't so much been sauted as saturated in grease, and the
carrots were waterlogged and tasteless.
By this stage dessert was the last thing on my mind, which was
probably just as well, because the choice included fudge doughnuts,
caramel shortcake, and sweet pastries, etc. However, I did decide on
some Earl Grey tea, but when I asked for a cup that was clean rather
than stained I was told ''that's what they're all like''.
Kelvingrove is one of Glasgow's most popular museums. That it can't
even serve tea in a clean cup is shocking; that its cafe menu pays
lip-service to good Scottish food -- with haggis-filled baked potatoes
-- is outrageous; that it is missing a great opportunity to tempt people
back to its cafe is very sad.
The People's Palace Museum, on Glasgow Green, is always fun to visit,
and its cafe has an enviable setting in the Winter Gardens. After the
experience of Kelvingrove things could only get better.
Choice is more limited, but there were two choices of soup. The lentil
and tomato was a bit watery, but nevertheless tasted good. The cafe is
run by the Glasgow Wholefood Catering Collective, and the menu leaned
towards vegetarian, with pasta with cheese and broccoli, vegetarian
pizza and hummus and bread sharing the blackboard menu with baked
potatoes, tuna pasta salad, and lasagne.
Deciding to compare pasta dishes wasn't a good idea. The pasta with
cheese and broccoli lacked a good cheese flavour; it was also very
powdery -- either packet cheese sauce or too much cornflour.
It was very cold in the Winter Gardens and most people were eating
with their coats on, which is not the fault of the caterers, although it
might boost sales of hot drinks. But the coffee was stewed. I'd guess it
had lain too long on the hotplate.
Dessert was a piece of chocolate crunchy cake, which was very sweet,
but it helped mask the bitterness of the coffee.
This cafe was marginally better than Kelvingrove, and service
certainly came with a smile. Space did appear limited, but no more so
than at the galleries in Edinburgh. It left me wondering why the same
high standard of food cannot be prepared in Glasgow's leading museums.
The restaurant in the Centre for Contemporary Arts is very pleasant,
and there is a wide menu, which is available throughout the day and into
the evening.
Starters included baked brie, two choices of soup, and a wild mushroom
loaf to satisfy those on a vegan diet. Main courses included spinach
dumplings, teriyaki of salmon, gnocchi and beef creole, just to name a
few. There is also a choice of salads and sandwiches and a choice of
around five daily specials. On the drinks side there is a huge selection
from ''new age'' herbal drinks to a fine selection of whiskies, beers,
and a wine list that leans heavily towards the New World.
I chose the shredded chicken and onion satay, which was a huge
serving, considering it was lunchtime. It was delicious; the chicken was
tender and the rice cooked to perfection, and a sprinkling of cashews
gave a nutty texture.
I shocked myself and decided against dessert, which included bread and
butter pudding, sticky toffee pudding, and peach brulee. Instead I opted
for a slice of banana bread, which was light and delicately flavoured,
and the cappuccino was very good.
The service was brisk, informed, and pleasant and eating in the cafe
was a hugely enjoyable experience. I'd recommend this cafe to anyone,
and was very relieved that Glasgow has at least one gallery cafe worthy
of a visit.
* Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Dumbarton Road, Glasgow.
People's Palace, Glasgow Green, Glasgow.
Centre for Contemporary Arts, 350 Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
* Fratelli Sarti, 133 Wellington Street, Glasgow. Tel: 0141 248 2228
THIS is a bustling restaurant and Italian delicatessen that serves
great cappuccino, pasta in the freshest sauces, and Parmesan cheese by
the ton!
The proprietors, the Sarti brothers, claim this is a little bit of
Italy in Glasgow and they're probably right. Enjoy a quick lunch of
toasted mozzarella on focaccia bread, a platter of Italian meats, or a
more leisurely meal in the evening.
Desserts include Italian specialities such as tiramisu. For those who
prefer cheese, there's a selection of Italian cheeses.
There is a good choice of Italian wines, and expansion plans will
create a larger wine-tasting area and more tables to enjoy the food.
* Cafe Rogano, 11 Exchange Place, Glasgow. Tel: 0141 248 4055
IF you want good food at a great price you would be hard pushed to
better Cafe Rogano.
It is situated downstairs from the famed Rogano, and the choice is
just as large but at around half the price. Contrary to what one might
think, the menu is not only fish and seafood, and there is even a
vegetarian alternative.
But in a restaurant where fish and seafood are important parts of the
menu, it would be criminal not to try dishes such as steamed shrimp dim
sum, grilled supreme of salmon teriyaki, and baked whole trout with
prawns and capers.
The creme brulee is hard to beat and the orange sorbet with Cointreau
a refreshing way to end a meal that is always enjoyable, well-cooked
with fresh ingredients, and affordable.
* The Moorings Hotel, Banavie, Fort William. Tel: 01397 772797
THE Moorings Hotel has an enviable setting by Neptune's Staircase on
the Caledonian Canal just north of Fort William, and its location close
to Loch Linnhe and the west coast means a good supply of fresh fish and
seafood.
Not surprisingly the menu leans towards fish and seafood. The last
time I was there I enjoyed the freshest prawns, scallops and salmon. But
the chef also makes good use of Highland game in the main restaurant
menu.
Service is friendly and informed. The Jacobean Restaurant is designed
around a nautical theme and certainly deserved winning the AA
Inspectors' Hotel of the Year 1994.

CLAIMS that four peers and several MPs were paid ''substantial sums''
to ask Ministers questions threatened to engulf the Government in
another round of politically damaging sleaze revelations last night.
Less than a month after the opening of the official inquiry into
standards in public life, Liberal Democrat Lord Lester, a lawyer, has
alleged one of his clients paid cash and ''indirect financial benefits''
to peers and MPs in exchange for parliamentary work. The payments were
not declared.
The potentially devastating revelation, published in last night's
London Evening Standard, does not name those involved. It purports to be
part of Lord Lester's confidential submission to a Lords' committee
investigating peers' finances.
Labour seized on the allegation. Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw
called on Lord Lester to reveal the identities of the peers and MPs
involved. ''These are very serious allegations which Lord Lester makes.
He must now name names,'' he said.
''I shall be pressing the relevant authorities to insist on a full and
thorough investigation into this matter and I shall also be referring it
to the Nolan committee.''
Lord Lester, a Recorder and leading human rights lawyer, has told a
Lords committee: ''One of my commercial clients at the Bar has informed
me that he has paid substantial sums and given indirect financial
benefits to some four peers, as well as several Members of the House of
Commons, to ask questions and take other action on behalf of him and his
company.
''None of them declared this interest to either House. My client
strongly suspects that his commercial competitors have similarly paid
substantial sums and given direct financial benefits to peers, as well
as MPs, to perform parliamentary activities on their behalf.''
There are 1200 peers, who, until now, have not been implicated in the
running sleaze controversy which last year saw two junior Ministers and
two parliamentary private secretaries resign their Government posts over
similar allegations.
The Lords sub-committee on declaration and registration of interests
confirmed it had received a submission from Lord Lester. A source
confirmed the ''leak pretty accurately quotes what is in the
memorandum''.
Labour front-bencher Elliot Morley said: ''The House of Lords is an
even greater hot-bed of vested interest than the House of Commons. Not
only do these allegations raise the whole issue of sleaze, but they also
reinforce the need for a root-and-branch reform of the House of Lords,
which is long overdue.''
Unlike MPs, peers do not have to sign a Register of Members' Interests
but are obliged to declare any interest on rising to intervene or make
speeches in the Lords. Their probity is considered a matter of honour.

PALE pink and mildly piquant, the menu said Spring Fruit Soup with --
rhubarb. Yuk! said some, while other more adventurous palates held out
their bowls and discovered a delicious new soup.
The 100-year-old recipe had been cooked by David Anderson, chef at the
Royal Overseas Club in Edinburgh, for the launch party buffet of dishes
from The Laird's Kitchen: 300 Years of Food in Scotland by Olive Geddes.
A difficult task for the cook? No, not at all. Methods may change,
fashions may come and go, but the basics remain. A soup is a soup is a
soup . . .
Geddes, a curator in the Manuscripts Division of the National Library
of Scotland, had found the soup recipe in the tiny spidery handwriting
of Stephana Malcolm -- a severe, prim-looking woman with a lacy bonnet
and black satin bow tied tightly beneath her chin. Yet Stephana was no
dour Calvinist when it came to cooking. She was the unmarried daughter
of George and Elizabeth Malcolm of Langholm and wrote three cookery
notebooks during her lifetime.
All in all, the industrious recipe-writing family produced seven
notebooks, providing a record which spanned four generations and covered
a period (1782 to 1890) of intense change and development in Scottish
food.
Unlike other wealthier scribblers, whose recipes are also uncovered in
the book for the first time, the Malcolm women were not rich. The
''superfluous trifles of haute cuisine'' which filled other pages were
not for them. They reflected the homely aspect of everyday cooking; the
puddings and pies made from orchard fruits, the broths and stews from
garden vegetables and the essential preserves to see them through the
winter.
But what is distinct in Stephana's notebooks, apart from her
successful use of rhubarb as a sharp appetite-arouser in a soup, is her
knowledge of spices. The family connection with India, and Eastern
spices, was through her brothers (three of them died there). Though it
was already available in grocers' shops, ready-mixed, from about the
1780s, she describes five different recipes for curry powder mixes. Her
simplest version, which includes turmeric, coriander, cumin, fenugreek,
and cayenne, must be ''finely powdered, well mixed and sifted''.
The menu for the launch night -- besides the soup -- was shrimp pie,
stuffed cucumbers, beef collops, baked apples and pears and a Victoria
pudding. The recipe writers may have belonged to the another age but
there was no sign that they were past their use-by date.
SPRING FRUIT SOUP
This is best made with the young delicate stalks of ''forced' rhubarb
which are now available.
Ingredients for 4:
1 oz butter
2 oz (50 g) streaky bacon, finely chopped
1 onion, finely chopped
4 oz (125 g) forced rhubarb, chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
2 pints (1 litre) water or chicken stock
1 oz (25 g) white breadcrumbs (optional)
salt and cayenne pepper
2 thin slices white bread
oil for frying
Method: Melt the butter in a pan and add the bacon, cook until lightly
browned. Add the onion and continue cooking until the onion is soft and
transparent and lightly coloured.
Add carrot, rhubarb and water/stock. Cook for half an hour.
Puree in blender. Add breadcrumbs to thicken (not essential).
Taste and season. For a finer consistency it can be sieved.
Cut the white bread into quarter-inch croutons and fry in oil until
golden, serve hot with the soup.
TO MAKE IN THE MICROWAVE
Put the butter, bacon, onion, rhubarb, and carrot into a bowl and
cover with clingfilm. Cook in the microwave on high for 6 - 7 minutes.
Remove, put into blender with the water/stock, the breadcrumbs and
seasoning.
Puree until very smooth. Serve with croutons.
BEEF COLLOPS
''Cut some thin slices of beef where it is tender, and beat it well
with your rolling pin. Then season it with pepper, salt, cloves, mace
and sweet herbs and lemon-peel very fine; season it with spice as above.
Lay a layer of this all over your collops and roll them up tight. Put
them in a can with a little butter, cover them close and bake them. When
they are done, take them out in slices, and put them on a dish. Pour on
some of their own gravy with a little white wine and the juice of half a
lemon. Don't make it sour. You may thicken it with a little butter and
flour. Grate nutmeg on it.'' Mrs Cleland (c 1759).
Ingredients for 4
1 lb (500 g) thinly cut rump steak
1 teaspoon whole mace
3 - 4 cloves
1 lemon
1 oz (25 g) fresh parsley or chives
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 oz butter
2 tablespoons oil
half a cup (4 fl oz/125 g) white wine
grated nutmeg
Method: Beat out the meat thinly and cut into four or eight strips.
Put the mace, cloves and peeled zest of the lemon into a grinder and
grind until fine. Chop the herbs finely and mix with the spices. Spread
over meat, season with salt and pepper, and roll up tightly. Heat butter
and oil in pan with a tight-fitting lid, add meat, brown lightly on all
sides. Cover and cook for 20 minutes or until the meat is tender,
turning once or twice. Remove meat to serving dish and finish sauce. Add
white wine and reduce, taste and season, add lemon juice a little at a
time. Pour over meat and grate over a little nutmeg.

ALMOST 100 mountain rescue personnel will resume a search at first
light this morning for two women students from the University of Central
Lancashire in Preston who have been missing on Ben Nevis since Thursday.
It is hoped they may be sheltering in a snow hole.
Chief Inspector John MacFadzean, who is leading the hunt, said last
night: ''We will be concentrating on an area below the location where we
believe they had been climbing. There is a lot of avalanche debris there
and we will be probing it.
''Obviously, things look ominous but there is still hope that they are
alive. There is natural speculation that, if they were fit and able,
they would have tried to draw attention to themselves by now. But the
fact that they did not have flares gives us a further glimmer that they
may be trapped somewhere.''
Miss Iona Roden, 22, of Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, and Miss Zoe
Green, 20, of Pittsmoor, Sheffield, are members of the university
union's climbing club which sent a 15-strong party to Lochaber last
Saturday.
On Thursday, they decided to tackle Ben Nevis in separate parties. But
the two failed to return to their rendezvous at Glen Nevis youth hostel
that evening and their colleagues raised the alarm.
Miss Roden, who is doing a BA Hons course in visual communication and
3D design, and Miss Green, a BA Hons student in journalism, are
understood to be well equipped for winter climbing, to have food with
them, and to have been trained in survival techniques.
Mr John Greer, of the student services department in Preston, said:
''They were experienced in climbing in Scotland and the Alps. We can
only hope for the best in the light of the girls' experience and
training.''
For over eight hours yesterday, more than 30 searchers fought through
sleet and snow, under the threat of avalanche, to comb the north face of
Ben Nevis before switching to the equally treacherous south side of the
mountain.
By early afternoon, they had scoured Tower Ridge on the north face and
checked the climbers' refuge on the summit. They then looked in the
notorious Five Finger Gully on the south side. Disoriented climbers
frequently stray off course into this area. The parents of Miss Roden --
known as Kim by her family -- were last night waiting anxiously at their
home in Warwickshire. Mrs Rhoda Roden said: ''We are praying that she
has managed to dig herself into a snow hole but I really don't hold out
much hope.
''Since Kim took up climbing nearly three years ago, she has fallen in
love with the mountains. She recently decided she would devote her life
to mountaineering and rock-climbing.''

Listen in or read all about your favourite music as The Herald's team
round up the new releases.
Notes of Noy, Notes of Joy, The Rowallan Consort (Temple Records)
* That's Noy as in sadness; but this disc is a joy. What a find. In
magical combination, the lute and harp playing of Robert Phillips and
William Taylor produce the most ravishing, resonant sounds, backing the
radiant singing of Mhairi Lawson and Paul Rendall in a stunning
collection of Scottish songs and instrumental music from between 1400
and 1700. The arrangements (and the sound) are a real spirit-lifter. A
must for folk as well as classical fans, and anyone remotely interested
in Scottish culture.
Haydn: English and Scottish Songs, Lawson/Tverskaya (Opus 111 Records)
* Mhairi Lawson again. One was taught that Haydn, inventor of the
symphony and general genius that he was, none the less wrote naff
arrangements of Scottish folk-songs for publisher George Thomson of
Edinburgh. Well, maybe as the song says: it's not what you do . . . but
in the bright and breezy vocal tones of Ms Lawson, this collection
fairly sparkles. Accompaniments are provided on an authentic Broadwood
fortepiano of 1816, brightly played by Olga Tverskaya. Worth a listen.
The Bel Canto Operas, by Charles Osborne (Methuen, #12.99)
* A BOOK for buffs. So come on then, smart alicks; how many operas did
Donizetti write? Okay: L'Elisir d'amore, Lucia di Lammermoor, Maria
Stuarda . . . eh . . . So what about the other 62, then? Charles
Osborne, famed for his opera studies of Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, etc, has
here produced a handbook to the ''beautiful song'' in the operas of
Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti. A fascinating guide to a whole swathe
of operas, the bulk of which remain unperformed. And it's not a gloss
job either. If they are justly forgotten, Osborne tends to say so. Handy
discography, including negative entries for those operas that have not
passed their studio audition. For publication February 13, though it may
creep on to the shelves before then.

Chilly Winds, John Stewart (Folk Era)
* Before the Fleetwood Mac-assisted Gold, before the classic
California Bloodlines, before he wrote Daydream Believer for the
Monkees, Stewart sang and wrote songs for early 60s folkies, the
Kingston Trio, with whom he recorded the majority of these tracks.
Re-recorded in the 1980s and distributed here for the first time, they
stand up surprisingly well, with Stewart's voice (similar to Johnny
Cash's but mellower and more melodically secure) as seductive as ever.
Jigs to the Moon, Dordan (gael-linn)
* Dordan's harmonious marriage of traditional Irish and classical
baroque music was a big hit at last year's Glasgow International Folk
Festival. On this second album the trio -- Dearbhaill Standun (fiddle),
Kathleen Loughnane (harp), and the remarkable tin-whistle player Mary
Bergin -- play pieces by Beethoven, Dussek and O Carolan, and dance
tunes from Cape Breton, England, Scotland, and Ireland, all with
customary poise and brio.

A DESPERATE man who ''cracked'' and beat his unruly teenage son after
social workers had ignored his pleas for help was yesterday admonished
at Stirling Sheriff Court.
The 49-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared
at the same court last July and was told to be of good behaviour for six
months.
The attack, on April 5, 1994, left the man's 15-year-old son with
bruises over his left eye, to his forehead, face, behind his ear, and on
his right arm.
Cuts and bruises were also found on his back and one shoulder, and a
doctor who examined the boy said that the injuries were consistent with
a repeated punching and kicking.
The court heard that before the incident the father had contacted
Central region's social work department on several occasions requesting
help.
He complained that the boy was outwith his control, staying out all
night, and abusive to neighbours.
Sheriff Colin Stein told the man: ''It appears from the reports that
you've found other ways of dealing with your son.
''I don't think it's in the public interest to impose a penalty on
you.''
The court heard that, as a result of the prosecution, the man, a
former joiner, had felt unable to return to his old job, which involved
youth training.

Stockholm, Friday
SWEDISH police have shown excerpts from a horrific pornographic video
on television in an attempt to find a boy filmed being raped and
sexually assaulted by two men.
British police are co-operating with the search for the attackers, two
of whom are thought to be English.
''The attack is the most ruthless we have seen,'' said Inspector
Anders Sundenius. ''Our goal is to find the attackers and the victim.''
Voice analysis has led police to the belief the men are English, he
added.
Police agreed to let a Swedish television channel screen excerpts of
the video this week, which shows an eight- to 10-year-old boy, who is
apparently Swedish, suffering sexual assaults at the hands of two men
over several hours.
Sundenius said the film was shown in the hope somebody might recognise
the boy, although the film could be about three years old.
Police in the Swedish city of Norrkjoping, which has established a
special unit to fight child pornography, said they suspected the two men
were English and the boy Swedish.
Sundenius said one theory was that the boy was a Swede attending
school in Britain. He is called by a Swedish name on the film and speaks
with a Swedish accent.
He said police in Britain and Sweden were contacting education
authorities to try to find the child.
Doctors say the boy appeared to be heavily drugged throughout the
prolonged attack.
Copies of the film, which appears to have become available on the
international paedophile market, have been obtained from the Netherlands
and Japan.--Reuter.

THE contrast is cruel. While Tony Blair and his party surge ahead in
the polls, France's discredited, divided, and demoralised Socialists
will be wondering aloud this weekend, at a Paris convention, what future
they have beyond the presidential election in May.
The 103,000 Socialist Party members throughout the country, still
shocked by Jacques Delors' decision not to stand on their behalf, lack
anyone of the stature of former Prime Ministers Pierre Beregovoy, who
committed suicide in 1993, or Michel Rocard, sacked as party leader last
year.
They voted yesterday for the man who will be their best possible loser
in the forthcoming poll. The candidates are the party's recently elected
First Secretary Henri Emmanuelli, 49, a left-winger who has the support
of 28% of Socialists, and former Education Minister and man of the
centre left, Lionel Jospin, 57, who is backed by 52%.
The victor will be officially announced at a party convention in Paris
tomorrow. The former Culture Minister Jack Lang, meanwhile, who could,
according to polls, have done better than either of the others in the
presidential election, acted on instructions from President Mitterrand
and announced a week ago that he would not be standing.
On the surface of things, the Socialists' internal poll may seem a
standard democratic procedure, if flavoured with a little Gallic high
feeling. It is certainly relished by the country's right-wing candidates
-- Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, the best placed
candidates on the right -- who stepped forward with the blessing of
their supporters, but without a party election.
However worthy, the election of a Socialist candidate which takes
place after five weeks of ungainly scrapping, has merely shown up the
depth of divisions within the party.
Even last week, Mr Lang was still sniping at Mr Jospin, ''a loser and
a record holder of election defeats''. This weekend's poll also
highlights the fact that the left in France has little of a programme
and has not, in any case, a hope in hell of winning.
Even saving face will be a problem. The Socialist candidate will be
fortunate to scrape more than 20% of votes and very lucky to get through
the first round of polling on April 23. It seems most likely that Mr
Chirac will confront Mr Balladur in the second-round poll in May.
Whatever tomorrow's result, it can only be bad for party unity. If Mr
Emmanuelli loses, his authority as party leader will be affected. If Mr
Jospin loses, a majority reformist tendency within the party will feel
unrepresented and obliged to rally behind an unpopular First Secretary.
Whoever does emerge victorious, will have secured only the doubtful
privilege of trying to persuade public opinion that the Socialists who
governed France from 1981 to 1993 could possibly provide anything less
disastrous for a further seven years.
Dogged in the last years of their government by financial scandals and
a complete inability to cope with a rapidly worsening economic
situation, the Socialists broke records for unpopularity in the General
Election of 1993, which gave the right wing a landslide victory.
Amazingly, they went on to do even worse in last year's European
election, polling a miserable 14%.
Grotesquely, the Socialists have not even thrown off the control of
President Mitterrand, who now contemplates, apparently unmoved, the
ruins of the party he created in 1971 as a vehicle to take him to the
Elysee.
While declaring in public he is above partisan quarrels, the President
favours Mr Emmanuelli and actively dislikes Mr Jospin, who has been
unstinting in his criticism of Mr Mitterrand's monarchical powers and
the influence and privileges enjoyed by the members of his ''court''.
In whatever sort of shape the Socialist Party emerges after this
weekend, it will have to try, somehow, to appeal to left-wing opinion.
Yet behind its pathetic election scores is a depth of disillusion which
could take a generation to dissipate.
Many of the Socialists' traditional themes, from unemployment to bad
housing, have been snatched away over recent months by Mr Chirac who has
been showing an unprecedented degree of social concern, as the
right-wing's ''caring'' candidate.
The Socialist Party has lost precious weeks over its own candidacy
arguments. It is difficult to imagine how much more self-destructive it
could become, short of voting to disband itself tomorrow.

From MARCIN GRAJEWSKI
Warsaw, Friday
POLISH Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, facing moves by President Lech
Walesa to dissolve Parliament unless his coalition steps down, today
defiantly rejected any prospect of quitting.
''I will not give in to activities which lead to conflicts and
unrest,'' Pawlak told a news conference after returning from a visit to
the United States.
Walesa yesterday began the formal process of dissolving Parliament,
declaring he would relent only if it dumped the ruling coalition of the
ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and Pawlak's smaller Polish
Peasant Party (PSL).
The move by Walesa, who believes Pawlak is delaying market reforms,
evoked loud protests from the main parties about the risk of a
constitutional crisis.
Lower house Speaker Josef Oleksy, an ex-communist, said that if Walesa
went on with attempts to scrap the Parliament it would haul him before
the State Tribunal, a court which may also be used to try General
Wojciech Jaruzelski for imposing martial law in 1981.
The lower house today approved a constitutional amendment allowing it
to continue to pass some legislation after it is dismissed and until a
new house is elected.
The amendment, overwhelmingly approved, still must clear the Senate
and be signed by Walesa to come into force. Given the tension between
president and Parliament, that could take weeks.
Walesa has challenged the Government's budget Bill before the
country's constitutional tribunal, delaying its final approval beyond a
three-month deadline and thereby giving himself a debatable pretext for
dissolving Parliament.
He says this is the only way he can oust Pawlak, whom he accuses of
delaying economic reforms and running a government in which some
Ministers stand accused of corruption.
The president has tried, so far in vain, to persuade the SLD to break
with Pawlak's party and form a pro-reform Cabinet.
Walesa and Pawlak have also clashed over the vacant Cabinet posts of
defence and foreign affairs. Walesa says Pawlak wants to rob him of a
say in the appointments.
Walesa portrays himself as a last bastion in power of Solidarity-era
Poland. He relishes the irony that ex-communists, who used martial law
in 1981 to crush his Solidarity union, now pose as champions of

<HEADLINE>Clinton's affairs once forced him to stand down, says book</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

Washington, Friday
THE White House launched a damage limitation operation today after a
new account of President Clinton's alleged efforts to suppress
information about his affairs and efforts to avoid the Vietnam War.
The latest problem follows publication of a book, First in His Class,
by Washington Post reporter David Maraniss.
The book quotes Betsey Wright, who was Clinton's chief of staff when
he was Governor of Arkansas, as saying that she confronted her boss with
a list of women with whom he allegedly had affairs.
After demanding that he ''face the issue squarely'', Wright and
Clinton and discussed whether or not he had an affair with each
individual named on the list -- and the likelihood of whether or not she
would discuss it in public, the book claims.
As a result, it says, Clinton decided not to run for President in
1988, the year in which fellow Democrat Gary Hart was forced to drop out
of the race because of public uproar over his own marriage problems.
Today White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said: ''I don't see a
lot of news here that needs additional comment.
''These issues were raised during the course of the President's 1992
campaign and were effectively dealt with.''
Questions about Clinton's character and extramarital affairs hounded
the President throughout the election and have continued to haunt him
since he took office.
In an interview with religious reporters today Clinton said questions
about his character were ''between me and God''.
He admitted frustration, however, that his reputation could be
tarnished by unfounded accusations.
''Sometimes you can actually disprove something someone says about
you, but a lot of times people can lie about you in ways that you can't
disprove,'' he said.
The book also goes into the other big issue that dogged Clinton
throughout the 1992 election: his actions to avoid military service
during the Vietnam War.
The book traces efforts by Clinton to destroy a 1969 letter he wrote
to a University of Arkansas official thanking him for ''saving'' him
from the call-up.
According to the book Clinton later thought he had succeeded, through
intermediaries, in having the letter removed from files and destroyed,
fearing it would undercut his budding political career.
In 1991, as Clinton prepared for his White House race, aides told him
reporters were asking about the letter. ''Don't worry about that,''
Clinton is quoted as saying: ''I've put that one to bed.''
A copy of the letter later surfaced.--Reuter.

From PATRICK BROGAN
Washington, Friday
THE first week of the O J Simpson trial has been just as exciting,
just as compulsive as all the Simpson groupies hoped.
There were new witnesses, new details and stories told in court that
we did not hear last summer, and quite enough courtroom drama to close
down the rest of national television.
The prosecution is laying out its case, and will take weeks, or even
months at the task. Then the defence will take even longer. An ordinary
murder trial would last only a couple of weeks (most of the Simpson
evidence will be redundant, however gripping) but this, of course, is
the trial of the century and we will get our money's worth.
How the jury will subsist, locked in a motel for four months at least,
remains to be seen.
Meanwhile, the drama continues outside the courtroom. O J Simpson's
book, I Want To Tell You, that hit the stores this week, is selling at
an astonishing rate.
It was put together by a writer after 15 interviews with the
celebrated defendant in the Los Angeles jail, ostensibly in response to
the hundreds of thousands of letters he has received.
You can also buy a tape of salient passages -- O J proclaiming his
innocence, O J proclaiming his love for Nicole. He would have stood in
front of a bullet to protect her, he says.
It all contrasts nicely with the evidence of wife-beating and other
abuse emerging in court. The agents are out hawking the O J
autobiography. Most publishers would hesitate to sign a contract before
the verdict is in, but it is quite possible some sleazy house will win
the deal, with a large advance. Mr Simpson needs it to pay his lawyers.
At the trial today, a second witness claims he saw four men near Mrs
Simpson's home on the night of the killings. Defence lawyer Johnnie
Cochran said prosecutors had questioned Leif Tilden, who the defence
believes can lend credene to their claim that investigators overlooked
other potential suspects in a ''rush to judgment''.
Cochran added that Mary Ann Gerchas, a witness discredited by
prosecutors as ''a groupie'' of the Simpson case, would testify to
having seen four men -- none of them black, like Simpson -- rushing away
from the area near Mrs Simpson's home.
It is a pity that the O J trial is swamping the airwaves: there are
two other extraordinary trials under way.
The first is the Islamic terrorism conspiracy trial in New York, in
which a blind Egyptian cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, and 11
associates are accused of planning to set off a series of bombs in the
city.
In the other trial, the defendant, Colin Ferguson, is accused of
killing six people and wounding another score on a Long Island train.
Ferguson's lawyers claimed that he was completely insane, but he has
insisted on defending himself. He denies everything, in the third
person. It is altogether weird: he cross-examines witnesses who saw him
and recognise him, asking: ''How could you know what was happening if
you were playing dead with your eyes closed?''
He is facing 94 charges, and asserts the number was chosen because
they were filed in 1994. Very strange. There is now a cable TV channel
devoted entirely to court proceedings: it will never be short of
material.

Bad Brothers, Ronny Jordan meets DJ Krush (Island)
* A mellow, collaborative trip-hop reworking of six tracks by jazz
guitar-god Jordan. His two established dancefloor-fillers, So What and
Season For Change, benefit most, but no literate groover should remain
unaware of the declamatory sinuousness of New York-based Puerto Rican
poet Dana Bryant on The Jackal. Buy this and pray, too, that Ronny will
soon settle down to recording a new LP.
It's Now Or Never, Various (Mercury)
* It is a little-known fact that Elvis the Pelvis had a stillborn twin
brother, Enis. I found myself recalling this arcane fact as I played
this mostly-live-in-Memphis tribute to Elvis Presley, particularly
during Marti Pellow's version of Now Or Never. Highlights: Dwight
Yoakam's rapt and rockin' version of Mystery Train; the Mavericks'
breathy, achy-breaky Love Me; Marty Stuart's lithe countrybilly Don't Be
Cruel. Lowlights: almost too many to mention, but led by Tony Bennett's
arthritic Love Me Tender, Michael Hutchence's limp Baby Let's Play
House; Billy Ray Virus's ham-fisted One Night; and Bryan Adams'
bite-free, house-trained Hound Dog. Invest in a decent collection of the
real stuff by the Tupelo Flash himself.
Cream, The Very Best Of. . . (Polydor)
* Pumped-up pile-driving power-trio acid-blues-boogie from the
all-time top pumped-up acid-blues-boogiein' pile-driving power trio,
yeah. Pounding bass excursions and cool vox from Jack Bruce! Searing
lead axe-work from Eric Clapton! Ginger Baker's drummy drums! Words of
narcoleptic revelation from Pete Brown! Twenty of the pithier, poppier
faves, from I Feel Free via Strange Brew and Crossroads to Badge.
Twenty-six years on, it's still occasionally good to walk like a bearded
rainbow, man.
Black Boots On Latin Feet, Ezio (Arista)
* Latinate duo who are much-hyped entrants in the Jeff Buckley
Impassioned And Sensitive Acoustic Folk-Rock Stakes. Sadly, however,
despite much impassioned and sensitive strumming and vocalising, there
are no songs.
Good News For The Next World, Simple Minds (Virgin)
* And the bad news for this world is that the Minds have stopped being
U2 circa 1987 and become Primal Scream c1991. This means that by the
year 2000 they will have become Oasis. Oh dear.

Cape Canaveral, Friday
THE US shuttle Discovery today embarked on a new space race, soaring
from Florida towards a planned rendezvous with Russia's Mir space
station.
Discovery blasted off from the Kennedy Space Centre with five Nasa
astronauts, including Britain's first astronaut, flight engineer Dr
Michael Foale, 38, who is due to walk in space during the mission.
The crew also include the world's first female spaceship pilot, Air
Force Lieutenant Colonel Eileen Collins, and veteran Russian cosmonaut
Vladimir Titov, who once spent an entire year in space.
The mission, scheduled to last eight days, will begin to merge the
human space programmes of two former Cold War foes and kick off a series
of US shuttle flights to dock with Mir.
Like a 700ft candle, Discovery burned a path through clear, starry
skies on its way to Earth orbit.
The crew of six began their voyage about 45 minutes after their
target, the space station, streaked like a shooting star high above
their launching pad.
The flight is to include a spacewalk by two crewmen, the deployment
and retrieval of a small space telescope, and a Coca-Cola taste test
among more than 20 Nasa-sponsored science experiments in a commercial
laboratory.
However, the main mission of the four men and two women is a
rendezvous with Mir. On Monday they will fly Discovery within 38ft of
the space station and then circle it while the crew conduct a
photographic survey.
The rendezvous is a rehearsal for several upcoming missions in which a
shuttle will visit and dock at the orbiting outpost. The first of those
flights is set for June.
Ground controllers later reported difficulties with two of the
shuttle's 44 steering jets -- problems with the potential to hinder the
Mir rendezvous and disrupt the mission.
One thruster had failed and another was giving indications of a slow
leak. Such jet failures are not uncommon for shuttles, and neither of
these jets is needed for the rendezvous.
However both jets are linked to other jets the shuttle must use to
perform its delicate dance around Mir, explained mission management team
leader Loren Shriver.
If the whole manifold had to be shut off, then a cancellation of the
rendezvous was possible, she added.
Anxiously watching Discovery's progress at their home in Cambridge
today were Dr Foale's parents, Air Commodore Colin and Mrs Mary Foale.
His mother said Dr Foale, who was born in Lincolnshire, had wanted to
go into space since he was six years old.
''He saw the capsule that John Glenn had come down in on one of his
missions and thought, 'Ah, I could do that','' she said.
''It is a great plesure that he is actually doing what he wanted to
do, what he dreamed of doing, what he trained to do. He is tremendously
enthusiastic, so it is very good he has the opportunity to do it.''
Air Commodore Foale said: ''I think he has true courage. He is very
fit and he can put the danger in the back of his mind.''
Dr Foale is now an American citizen with a home in Texas having
emigrated in 1982 to become an astronaut after gaining a PhD in
astrophysics from Cambridge University.--Reuter.

Moscow, Friday
BORIS YELTSIN'S Defence Minister checked into a hospital this week
with a case of ''cowardice'' after the president confronted him about a
secret German bank account, a newspaper reported today.
The influential daily Segodnya published the accusation against
embattled Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, who has been under fire for
his role in the Chechnya war and corruption charges.
Several newspapers have speculated in recent days that Grachev would
soon be sacked.
Segodnya cited a document Yeltsin presented to Grachev last week,
saying the president had evidence that the Defence Ministry had kept
millions of pounds in the account since 1992.
The money resulted from the sale of Warsaw Pact military equipment,
ammunition, uniforms, and even fuel, the newspaper said.
Segodnya added: ''Grachev felt sick immediately after the incident.''
Grachev's aide said he had been in hospital for two days. Today he
missed a meeting of top military commanders.
Segodnya said: ''The diagnosis is simple: 'trench disease'. This is
what primitive cowardice has been called since the Second World
War.''--AP.

of 1ft a day, but authorities say they need time to check weakened

Ken Bruce happily admits that his show is going nowhere fast. He
prefers it to go at a much more relaxed pace, finds William Hunter
This is a ridiculous job really. You are just sitting playing records
and talking to yourself. It's not a job at all
DISC jockeys have been racing for so long their stakes have become
diamond. Since their off have passed 60 long-playing years of music and
patter on the airways, although at the start they were not always called
DJs. Some preferred more genteelly to style themselves as gramophone
presenters. Compton Mackenzie, author of Whisky Galore and much else,
was one of their number.
In their British pedigree the breed is by Mackenzie out of Christopher
Stone. In America the lineage is longer. The first record show to be a
hit was called Make Believe Ballroom from New York away back then in
l935.
For all he likes to protest his maturity of years, Ken Bruce had not
heard of it. The anniversary of his own he has reached is more modest --
less diamond than tin. Ten years ago he became a regular presenter on
BBC Radio 2.
When Terry Wogan was re-invented for television, Ken Bruce became the
unknown Scot called in to fill a considerable gap. Only temporarily,
some wise forecasters whispered. Among them was Ken Bruce. ''Whoever
went in there was on a hiding to nothing,'' he recalled. ''I had hardly
started when I knew it couldn't be done. It was not going to work.''
Yet he did all the right things. ''I've got my Boy's Own book on
broadcasting and a copy of handy hints on how to be a personality,'' he
remarked with a rough shyness that caught off their guard colleagues who
had been expecting another youngish (aged 33) Jock on the make. When
snow fell over England on the morning of his first airing, he demurred
that there had been no need to go to all that bother to make him feel at
home. He kept his patter short and plain.
The trouble was that regular listeners who now find him a tonic could
not take him in the early morning. He did not go with breakfast.
''It's amazing, and nobody knows why,'' he said, ''that radio people
work at certain times of the day. Move them around and they don't sound
right. Mid-morning is my time of day for my kind of stuff.''
He agreed that he had not much wanted to stay in London. But it wasn't
ambition that kept him there. Without dragging in his historic namesake
and the dogged example of a cave spider, he suggested it was
stubbornness.
Having been exercised early in the day, he was then given a run late,
late before he found his natural time zone. Now the pleasure of Radio
2's Mid-Morning Man is to make the nation feel better at ll.30am than it
did two hours earlier. He made no other grander or more airy claim for
his programme.
''There is not much to it really,'' he said. ''There is not a great
ethos behind it. It lacks a higher purpose. All it is there to do is
pass two hours with nice music and to give people a smile.
''I'm not a comedian. I don't tell jokes. I just say things in a
slightly oddish way. If you write it down, it looks like nothing at
all.''
He paused: ''Which is why I don't write it down.
''But there is nothing there. Nothing important is ever said. It
passes the time. And there is a kind of mischief that I like to bring to
it. I like to be mischievous -- not satirical or sarcastic. Cheeky? Yes!
It is the Scottish sense of humour that's a bit harder, I think. People
take offence more readily in England, whereas in Scotland from an early
age folk are expected to put up with everything, and to give it as well.
''At first when I came down here people said: 'He's a bit sharp, you
know, nippy.' But they have got used to it now.''
Harder to get used to will be his programme's loss of its cafetiere.
For a longer percolating time than he can remember he kept bubbling as
for a daily elevenses many blends of whimsy about a coffee maker that
was a gift to listeners for their prize letters. More than caffeine was
extracted.
Wilfully, it was misheard to be a cafeteria and even a catheter.
Worse, he was accused of mispronouncing cafetiere in an English accent,
which became another good source of Scotch cheek.
Nothing, however, is for ever even on Radio 2. In a revolutionary
change which could rank as one of the bigger little moments in the
history of broadcasting, the prize has become a biscuit barrel.
''Nothing to do with me,'' he protested. ''That's far too big a change
to be left to a presenter.''
On the morning of the sudden switch in BBC largesse he found he could
not make much of a biscuit barrel. For once he sounded less than crisp
-- more digestive than rich tea. ''It's a terrific biscuit barrel,'' he
suggested in a tentative way like a carnival barker unsure about exactly
what was going on in the tent behind him. ''It's made of, um, clay,'' he
expanded on its virtues. Only slowly did he begin to remake it in his
own image. In listeners' eyes it became an object of well-rounded
contours. ''It is modelled on myself,'' he told the nation.
No sooner had he held out the portly pot than he dropped it. He last
week took off with his second family for a holiday in the Canaries and
as if to polish some cannonballs to fire from his barrel.
Tonight he will target old friends.
As part of Radio 2's enthusiasm for exhuming its ancestors he will
introduce the first of a series of archival comics -- Les Dawson, Tony
Hancock, and Frankie Howerd among them. For Saturday early-evening fun
there will also be The Goon Show, Radioactive, and The Navy Lark. His
trip back in time to laughter will begin with four programmes of Round
the Horne.
Getting in his plug, he said: ''In the first episode the famous
characters and catchwords are just being introduced by the legendary
cast of Kenneth Williams, Bill Pertwee, Betty Marsden, Hugh Paddick, and
Kenneth Horne.''
Having laboured at his intros, because he doesn't write easily, he
felt entitled to add: ''Everybody has a good time. The cast are enjoying
themselves, the band are shouting, and the audience are laughing before
the jokes are made.
''It is a conspiracy almost between the audience, the cast, and the
listener.''
Thirty years ago (another anniversary) when, along with everybody else
who had a radio, he made his first voyage around Horne, he was a
juvenile teenager who kept his ear glued to the wireless. He listened
into the wee hours and from before the milkman came in the mornings on a
heavy portable set of the kind that operated when the lid was pulled up.
He became a boyish admirer of the late Douglas Smith, who led a double
life as a broadcaster. On the old Home Service he remotely and
impersonally read the news. Yet there he was jumping the wavelengths to
do turns on the Light Programme, trying to keep in order Brother
Gruntfuttuck (Kenneth Williams) on Round the Horne. ''That's a great
job,'' young Bruce thought. He practised broadcasting chunks out of
newspapers into a tape recorder.
Career choice -- probably more his parents' idea than his -- took him
in another direction. He is a stickit chartered accountant and former
car-hire manager. Broadcasting still beckoned. All it seemed to demand
by way of job qualifications was to turn up on time and capable of
speech.
For Radio Scotland he read the news, introduced music concerts, did
weather forecasts for shipping, and recited the fish prices from
Peterhead. Sharing shows with Brian Fahey and the lamented Scottish
Radio Orchestra, he learned to be at matey ease with musicians.
He talked posher then than now. ''I was trying to do the right
thing,'' he explained. Now he finds himself concerned that his daughter
Kate, aged two, when she says No to him, says it in a London accent.
(Ealing, actually.) ''I am not liking it much at the moment,'' he
conceded.
As an occasional relief presenter in London he was lucky to work with
Ray Moore. ''He was the perfect broadcaster -- inventive without being
zany. He once introduced a ragtime piano solo by gagging that it was
played by a particularly stiff and solemn politician of the time. All
through the tune you had this image of his mad eyes and lofty look as he
pounded the keys. It was pure radio. Not something you could do in
print.
''But this is a ridiculous job really. You are just sitting playing
records and talking to yourself. It's what people do in the evenings. It
is not a job at all.''
He once appeared in a pantomime and that was also ridiculous. ''I got
away with it, just. But I felt so ill at ease because I wasn't in my
element. I could tell the difference and I'm sure the audience could.''
When he was off the air, he insisted, it was like being off his
life-support system. ''The only time I'm really on song is when I'm in a
radio studio. That's when my mind is working. The rest of the time I'm
in suspended animation or hibernation, if you like. I'm one step behind
everybody else. I'm not that quick.''
Yet wireless finds people out and fears not to show up any flaws in
them. ''Radio has a great artifice filter,'' was how he put it. If you
are being artificial, it comes over.
''You hear a lot more of somebody's personality than you see on
television. On TV it is all artifice. You are made up, you put on your
best suit, you have been treated like a god by everybody round about you
because that's the way television runs. On radio it is almost exactly
the opposite. When you turn up, somebody'll say: Oh, that's him in
again. And you are in your old clothes.''
After his last show before going away for his holiday he looked
dressed less for the Canaries than for carting garden compost -- plaid
shirt and ancient corde du roi breeks under the remnant of an anorak.
About similarly attired, he once met a ponderously posh captain of
industry on a train journey.
Their introduction was not the best, unhelped as it was by how he had
taken the tycoon's seat. But in the shared risk of eating a railway meal
together their meeting grew warmer.
After some wine the businessman felt emboldened to ask if a gramophone
presenter felt any guilt about not contributing to the gross national
product.
''I replied that it had never occurred to me in my life. I didn't
regard commerce as the be-all and end-all of life as he seemed to.
''I get letters -- not two a day or even one, but about once a month
-- from people saying I really cheered them up today. Or, more
importantly, from people who said they were going through a bad time and
were so low, and that the only thing that kept them going was my
programme.
''And I thought I would rather be doing that than making widgets for
export,'' Ken Bruce said. ''One letter like that makes it all
worthwhile.''

The works of A J Cronin have a special place in the hearts of the
nation, and within the nation itself, finds John Summers
THE AUTHOR A J Cronin once said: ''Nye Bevan always said that it was
through reading my novel about Wales that he became determined to invent
the National Health Service if ever he got to political power. And as
soon as he was Health Minister, he did.''
When Cronin said this he was living in self-imposed tax exile in
Switzerland and seeing his ever-popular novels still being eagerly
bought and read, and that long-running medical drama series on
television, Doctor Finlay's Casebook.
The author was recalling his adventures as an impoverished young
doctor at Tredegar in South Wales, where he was employed by Nye Bevan's
medical aid society -- it became the blueprint for the entire National
Health Service that Bevan presented to the British people in 1948. Bevan
served on its committee.
This medical aid society was founded in the 1870s with workers paying
just threepence in the pound from their wages to guarantee free medical
attention and dental treatment for its 20,000 members drawn from 10
coalpits in the area -- sadly, it closed down at the start of this year
for lack of funds.
Dr Cronin had come as a young locum to the mining and industrial town
of Tredegar in the 1920s, and he said the first words of Welsh he had to
learn were ''Ti'n gweithio dan ddaear?'' (Do you work underground?)
because so many of his patients had silicosis. A great man for making a
drama out of a crisis, he was already planning how he could use his
experience in Tredegar to write a novel, and would leap astride his
motorbike to roar off over the mountain to the ruins of Llanthony Abbey
near Abergavenny and plan it out chapter by chapter.
Riding over the mountain on his motorbike was a badly-needed break on
his days off from his arduous duties in his Tredegar surgery. But mainly
it gave him time to start scribbling notes for the first chapter all
about his Tredegar adventures.
In his resultant novel, The Citadel, he was to portray himself as the
young Tredegar doctor who uses dynamite to blow up the town's
notoriously unhealthy drains to force the local authorities to replace
them: drains so dangerous that the big cholera cemetery at nearby Cefn
Golau on the mountain above the town can prove it to you today.
Cronin, though brought up a Catholic, confessed that he had
''conveniently'' forgotten his Christianity, but now, as he put it, he
began to hear ''The beat of those pursuing feet, that secret whisper,
'Rise, clasp my hand and come','' while contemplating the ruins of this
great old Welsh abbey -- said to be the one where St David himself lived
for a time, as the poet Robert Southey wrote: ''Here it was, stranger,
that the Patron Saint of Cambria passed his age of penitence. A solitary
man . . . ''
A Norman knight at the time of William the Conqueror had found this
secret valley in the mountains, and so sickened was he by the pleasures
of the royal court that he had dismounted from his horse, resolved to
spend his days in quiet contemplation inside what is now said to be the
ruin of St David's actual cell.
A royal chaplain decided to join him there and by 1120 AD the abbey
had been built, though after the Dissolution of the Monasteries the
abbey and its lands were given to the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.
It was here that young Dr Cronin contemplated the blue bowl of the
Welsh sky, alive with the shrill, sweet sound of larks and meadow
pippits and, as he was later to write in his autobiography, Adventures
in Two Worlds: ''I had the immense discovery of why I was alive,'' and
felt the conviction that he was destined to become a writer, as he
addressed the question to himself: ''Why am I here? and where am I
going?''
Soon afterwards he left Tredegar and became a brilliant Harley Street
specialist, but Cronin would return again and again to Llanthony Abbey
for what he called ''a spot of trout-fishing and spiritual renewal''.
Falling ill with a stomach ulcer, Cronin left Harley Street for an
enforced holiday back in Scotland, taking with him a pile of school
exercise books. ''Finally, I opened the first exercise book, firmly I
jogged my fountain pen out of its habitual inertia . . . '' and he began
to write.
But then ''a wave of horror broke'' over him as his manuscript when it
came back to him typed chapter by chapter. ''Had I really written this
rubbish?'' Dr Cronin, heartsick with embarrassment, threw his manuscript
out. Shamefacedly, next day he retrieved it, dried the rainwater from
it, plucked out the name of a London publisher ''literally with a pin'',
and sent it off in a parcel.
The novel was published -- Hatter's Castle, an instant international
best-seller. This was in the 1930s. It was translated into 21 languages,
selling millions of copies -- and enabling Cronin to write his
long-planned novel about his adventures in Tredegar with Aneurin Bevan's
medical aid society. He wrote much of this at Llanthony Abbey, staying
at a nearby inn and ''with trout rod in hand by day and my fountain pen
in hand by night''.
Titled The Citadel, it was another resounding success and was made
into a film, as were other Cronin novels like The Keys of the Kingdom
and The Green Years.
A BBC Wales scriptwriter, the late Harry Green from Neath, found a
copy of Cronin's autobiography in a second-hand bookshop and got the
idea of using just one of its chapters as the basis for a new series on
television about a young Scots doctor in a village, and his senior
partner called Dr Cameron. The young doctor was of course Tredegar's
young Dr Cronin, transferred to Tannochbrae, and this was Dr Finlay's
Casebook.
After a mightily successful series in the 1960s and 70s, a new Dr
Finlay and Dr Cameron have been more recently brought to our TV screens
again. The popularity of Dr Cronin's novels continues -- still widely
read, still in print. And Tredegar still looks much the same as the
young Dr Cronin would have known it, although the mines and much of the
heavier industry are gone. The name of Aneurin Bevan is still magic in
the town. Streets are named after him, and leisure centres.
But, like his fellow doctor Somerset Maugham, the Scottish author
found himself driven into tax exile by the tax on authors that, unlike
some other countries such Eire, is so punitive towards British writers.
No history of the twentieth century in Britain can be complete without
recognising the significance of A J Cronin and Nye Bevan having worked
in Tredegar at the same time on what was to be the blueprint for the
National Health Service.

A DRUG dealer was sentenced to 240 hours of community service at
Inverness High Court yesterday.
Musician David Bremner, 43, escaped a prison sentence despite
admitting being concerned in the supply of more than 600g of cannabis,
with a street value of #3000.
Defence advocate Ian Duguid told Judge Lord MacLean that Bremner, a
former enrolled nurse, was ''a good and caring man'' who had given up a
lucrative career in Edinburgh as a musician to return to Easter Ross to
look after his ailing parents.
He said Bremner had run up large debts to look after his family and
had passed up musical engagements.
Mr Duguid claimed that Bremner had also become a father-figure to two
nephews after Bremner's brother had killed himself.
Mr Duguid said Bremner's mother had died the day after her son had
been arrested on the drug charges and his father was now in hospital.
''My client has two children of his own, and because his wife, to whom
he is devoted, has physical and mental problems, they are likely to be
taken into care if he is jailed,'' added Mr Duguid.
Advocate-depute Iain Bonomy had described Bremner, of Ivy Lane, St
Duthus Street, Tain, as a leading player in a commercial drug-dealing
operation.
Lord MacLean, however, said he would treat Bremner with ''extreme
leniency'', adding that he would normally sentence a convicted drug
dealer to three or four years in jail.
''I can't do that, however, because of all the people who are solely
dependent upon you,'' said the judge.
Lord MacLean warned Bremner: ''If you do not carry out this period of
community service, then you will be in prison for years.''

<HEADLINE>Court backs Howard's right to detain asylum-seekers</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980025613</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Home Secretary welcomed a court ruling yesterday which upheld the
Government's right to detain asylum-seekers.
But the decision by three Court of Appeal judges, to overturn a test
case ruling which would have signalled the release of hundreds of
detainees, was deplored by refugee pressure groups.
In a High Court judgment last month, Mr Justice Dyson said illegal
immigrants who applied for political asylum could not be held in custody
under the 1971 Immigration Act.
He ruled that four men -- Mr Rehmat Khan, from Pakistan, and Mr
Parmjett Singh Virk, Mr Inderpal Singh, and Mr Pal Taggar, from India --
were being ''illegally detained'' through misuse of immigration laws.
But yesterday Lord Justice Leggatt, sitting with Lord Justice Otton
and Sir Ralph Gibson, overturned the ruling and said the detention of
the four was ''justifiable''.
Later, Mr Michael Howard said the decision confirmed the Government's
interpretation of the Act.
''The Government pursues its immigration policy firmly and fairly.
Detention of asylum-seekers is only used as a last resort. Less than
1.5% of asylum-seekers are detained. They are only detained if it is
felt that they would not voluntarily comply with restrictions placed on
their release.
''The vast majority of those who have sought asylum remain in the
community while their cases are considered.''
Lawyers for the four were refused leave to challenge the ruling in the
House of Lords, but plan to petition the Law Lords for permission to
appeal.
The four asylum-seekers were all on bail pending yesterday's judgment.
After the ruling they surrendered to immigration officials, but were
temporarily released pending consideration of their applications for
asylum.
Speaking of his dismay at the decision, Mr Pal Taggar, 29, originally
from the Punjab but now living in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire,
explained why he was seeking asylum.
''No-one knows what is happening in India. It is dangerous, there are
no human rights.''
Immigration lawyers immediately called for new legislation to enable
asylum-seekers to obtain bail pending consideration of their
applications.
Mr Nicholas Blake QC, chairman of the Immigration Law Practitioners'
Association, said those fleeing from persecution could spend up to nine
months in UK detention with no right of appeal.
''A suspected murderer or someone charged with a heavy crime is better
off because at least they have the chance to apply for bail. These
people have none,'' he said.

Italian whites are not all great, Conrad Wilson admits, but some are
very, very good
ASK an Italian shopkeeper for the white equivalent of a bottle of
Barolo, and you will almost certainly be offered a Gavi or, even better,
a Gavi di Gavi. It comes from the same great northern region, Piemonte,
and it possesses, at least for Italians, the same great northern allure.
It is fashionable, expensive, as clean and razor-sharp as Premana
cutlery and conspicuously the right match for an Armani suit or a little
something by Gianfranco Ferre.
British wine buffs, on the other hand, tend to dismiss it as a wine
disappointingly neutral and grossly over-priced. Only La Scolca, with
its classy black label, wins a four-star rating (signifying ''grand,
exceptional'') in Burton Anderson's guide to Italian wines, but at
Valvona &amp; Crolla, in Edinburgh, it costs #20 a bottle. For this
Burgundy-like price, however, you get a ''rich, almost Burgundian
texture, depth of aroma and length of flavour'', as well as genuine
individuality of character. If you have a birthday to celebrate, this
could be the wine for you.
Certainly it is an experience vastly different from the perfectly
respectable but rather indifferent sort of Gavi generally stocked by
Britain's high-street chains for less than #7. But then, the same could
be said for a top-flight Vernaccia (#12.69 from Valvona), a top-flight
Frascati (#11.99), or a Gaja Chardonnay (#31). You pay, as they say, for
what you get.
But there is a Piemontese alternative to Gavi at a more accessible
price, and that is Arneis, which Thresher sells for #6.99. True, placed
a bit near lowly bottles of Orvieto and Bianco di Custoza, even that
could seem somewhat dear for a wine that is an unknown quantity in
Britain. Though Burton Anderson's two-star rating (''above average'') is
moderately reassuring, there are plenty of good French whites, including
Chablis and Gewurztraminer, that can be bought for the same price.
But Anderson adds that Arneis -- a wine whose fortunes were thought to
be fading -- is undergoing revival in Italy, and the Thresher version, a
1992 Castello di Neive, shows why. Many Italian whites of the 1992
vintage are now distinctly tired, but this one is light, elegant,
delicately floral -- a perfect aperitivo and a natural partner for fish.
Thresher is right to have faith in it.
Arneis, in my experience, has been making conspicuous inroads on the
wine-lists of Milanese restaurants, where it is a good deal cheaper than
Gavi. I have yet to find it on a Scottish list, but its range of
flavours are worth exploring. Valvona stocks a frisky, capitivating
version called Ceretto for #9.99.
Another newcomer -- at least to Thresher's shelves -- is Le Volte,
which sounds like the name of a sixteenth-century dance, but is in fact
a Tuscan red whose softness of flavour will appeal to those who find
Italian reds generally too acrid. But softness alone would not justify
the price of #7.99 a bottle, and the attraction of this one lies in the
complexity of taste that lies behind the softness.
The wine comes from the Maritime Hills of Bolgheri south of Pisa and
near the village of Castagnetl Carducci, where the Zyw family produce
their glorious Poggio Lamentano olive-oil. From around here, too, comes
Sassicaia, Italy's poshest red, based almost completely on cabernet
sauvignon grapes. Le Volte may not be in that class, but it does use
cabernet sauvignon as part of its make-up, mixing it with Italian
Sangioveto. Though still young for a red of its quality -- Thresher
stocks the 1992 vintage -- it already offers quite easy drinking.
Even easier, because that is what they set out to be, are a pair of
Venetian whites from Safeway, a Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio del
Triveneto, both around the #3.50 mark. Both from the massive Gruppo
Italiano Vini company, these are wines unashamed of their lack of
pedigree, but -- the Pino Grigio particularly -- they are just what you
would hope to find in a good pizzeria.

Lesley Duncan discovers what food and drink fuels one of Scottish
Opera's stars
* ''ON rehearsal days I get up at 7am and tend to wander about before
I have breakfast, normally some toast and fruit (an apple and banana)
and a cup of tea,'' explains Lisa Milne, who sings Susanna in Scottish
Opera's The Marriage of Figaro. ''Rehearsals are at Scottish Opera's
headquarters at Elmbank Crescent. If I'm feeling a bit lacklustre I'll
have a banana and can of diet Coke at the mid-morning break.
''Lunchtime depends on how busy the schedule is but I'll normally have
a sandwich or a filled roll -- egg mayo, chicken salad -- maybe another
cup of tea, a bottle of mineral water, and an orange. I eat heaps of
fruit. There are more rehearsals in the afternoon and another break
about 4pm. That time I don't eat anything. I tend to drink mineral water
or diet Coke.
''Because of a singer's lifestyle, every day can be different. I don't
like to eat too heavily before a performance. I'll take something light
like fruit salad or crispbread with a bit of ham in the late afternoon.
I don't eat again until after 10.30 pm. If I'm being sensible I'll just
have some soup. If I'm eating out I would probably choose king prawns
with mushrooms and boiled rice.
''On the first night of Figaro there was a reception afterwards with
food laid on. I don't like to eat immediately after a performance. I
have to wind down. I had some soup at home then went to bed.
''If I'm performing I don't drink alcohol at all for at least 24 hours
beforehand.''

THE Convention of Scottish Local Authorities was attacked yesterday as
a bastion of municipal quangoism by the Scottish Liberal Democrats'
leader, Mr Jim Wallace.
The MP for Orkney and Shetland has written to Cosla's Labour
president, Councillor Rosemary McKenna, demanding better political
balance for council representation on the convention.
The Liberal Democrats are angry that a recent report on the future of
the umbrella organisation after local government reorganisation leaves
the issue of who becomes a Cosla representative up to councils.
They point out that at present, 60% of the representatives are Labour
councillors which is not proportional to the party balance in councils.
The Liberals, who have 9.9% of councillors, have only 7.4% of Cosla
representatives.
The SNP, with 14% of councillors, have only 4.7% representation, and
the Tories, with 14.7% of councillors, have 8.8%.
Mr Wallace said: ''Labour's municipal quangoism in Scottish local
government is well documented. Cosla should use local government reform
to end the obvious unfairness in its rules. Their refusal so far looks
like another example of Labour protecting their own vested interests.''
A Cosla spokeswoman said the report was published as a consultative
document and views from all groups were welcome. No final decisions
about the future of the convention would be made until the annual
conference next month.

FAMILY and friends yesterday said farewell to Scotland's Mr Funfair,
Alfred Codona, who died this week aged 79.
They gathered at his Sunset Boulevard fair on Aberdeen's seafront for
a service in the dodgem car arena, during which the coffin sat beside a
solitary dodgem flanked by flowers while the priest conducted the
service from the ticket booth.
The mourners included civic dignitaries, Aberdeen football club
manager Willie Miller and his wife Claire, who is a niece of Mr Codona,
and representatives of charities which he supported.
Mr Codona suffered a heart attack at Peebles Hydro where he and his
wife Emily had been attending an annual banquet for fairground folk.
He was born in a caravan beside his father's travelling fair in
Queensferry. The Codona Fair was one of Scotland's largest in the 1920s.
Alfred spent the summer months working for the fair but in winter
attended school in Glasgow.
Mr Codona settled in Aberdeen 25 years ago and helped build up the
family business, John Codona's Pleasure Fairs Ltd, its most recent
addition being the #1.5m Sunset Boulevard complex.
The fairground service was followed by another at Aberdeen
crematorium.

<HEADLINE>Bottomley summoned to court over bed shortage</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980025618</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A JUDGE yesterday issued a summons against Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the
Health Secretary, demanding that she appear in court to explain why a
psychiatric bed cannot be found for a ''very disturbed'' defendant.
Judge Anthony Thorpe ordered Mrs Bottomley to appear personally at
Chichester Crown Court next Friday to justify the level of secure
provision which has left Sharon Towes without treatment.
Towes, 27, pled guilty to malicious wounding after stabbing a man.
On each of the seven times she has appeared before him, Judge Thorpe
has asked for her to be sent to a medium secure unit. Instead she has
spent nine months in Holloway jail, north London.
Yesterday he told the court: ''I find this situation quite
unacceptable, that in a modern, humane society this court is being
forced to keep a very disturbed young woman in prison when she should be
receiving treatment.
''This is a matter of grave concern to the court and should be of
equal concern to the Secretary of State, who will now be personally
appraised to explain this sorry state of affairs.''
Although judges threatened to bring Mrs Bottomley to court in two
similar cases late last year, no summons were issued. In each case beds
were found for mentally unstable defendants within the court's deadline.
Judge Thorpe adjourned the Towes case on Wednesday and warned Mrs
Bottomley that unless action was taken by yesterday he would summons
her.
Department of Health lawyers were examining the order, to see if Mrs
Bottomley must appear in court -- the summons specifies her in person.
A Department of Health spokesman said: ''The Secretary of State is
aware of this case and what the judge has said.
''It is the responsibility in the first instance of South Thames
Regional Health Authority to secure a place for this patient.
''The Government places high priority on the need to provide
sufficient medium secure accommodation beds, as part of a comprehensive
response to the needs or mentally disordered offenders.
''It looks to health authorities to make sure this happens.''
A psychiatrist's report warned the court that Ms Towes was a severe
danger to society.
''I am of the opinion that Miss Towes suffers from a personality
disorder of an anti-social kind and that consequently she is an
extremely dangerous young woman,'' it read.
''She has the capacity to act out her pervasive violent fantasies. I
would predict that unless her condition can be treated the likelihood of
her offending violently in the future is not only likely but almost
inevitable.''
A South Thames Regional Health Authority spokesman said: ''We will
ensure that every effort is made to find Ms Towes a suitable medium
secure bed as soon as possible.''
The region, which covers south London, Kent, Sussex and Surrey, has
102 medium secure beds.
It plans to open 30 more in April in Tooting, south London, using an
extra #1m from the department. A further 35 beds are planned at Bracton
Clinic, Bexley, within 18 months, the spokesman said.

THE key witness in the ''Ice Cream War'' trial in Glasgow 10 years ago
will not be prosecuted for perjury but he may now be sued for damages by
some of the men he helped to jail, the Crown Office said yesterday,
It said there was insufficient reliable evidence to justify
proceedings against Mr William Love, who has confessed that he lied at
the trial.
The decision effectively means that the two men jailed for life for
the Ice Cream War murders -- in which six members of a family in
Ruchazie, Glasgow, died after their house was set ablaze -- have had
their main hope of freedom removed.
Both Thomas Campbell, who was told by the judge that 20 years of his
life sentence would run before he could be considered for parole, and
Joseph Steele have consistently alleged they were victims of a
miscarriage of justice.
Campbell yesterday told The Herald from Shotts Prison, Lanarkshire:
''I now expect I will die in here but I will fight them to the death. I
fully expect they will keep me in solitary and deny me visits but I will
not bow down to them.''
Campbell's sister, Mrs Agnes Lafferty, said that they would now seek
legal advice on raising a civil action against Mr Love.
''It is nothing to do with money. It is to establish that he lied at
the trial. If the Crown thinks we are going away, they are deeply
mistaken,'' she said.
One of the men tried along with Campbell and Steele, Thomas ''Tambo''
Gray, who received a 14-year sentence after conviction for shooting at
the Doyles' ice cream van, is at the forefront of the move for civil
action.
Mr Love has repeatedly confessed he carried out the shooting of the
van and his sister witnessed the incident.
He is currently on remand in Wormwood Scrubs Prison, London, awaiting
a court appearance for allegedly driving while disqualified. He is using
another name, William Bonini.
His sister, Mrs Agnes Carlton, with whom he lives in London, said
yesterday: ''I know he will be gutted by this decision. He still says he
lied at the trial because he was forced into it by the police and he has
had to live with it ever since.
''He has never been threatened. It is simply that he had time to think
about what he did and he cannot get it off his conscience.''
Campbell, the last man to leave the Barlinnie Special Unit when it was
closed last month, is now on hunger strike in Shotts Prison, the latest
in a long line of protests.
He is insisting that his imprisonment is unlawful and that he should
be entitled to have the privileges of an untried prisoner, including
wearing his own clothes and eating food brought in by family and
friends. He has lost between two and three stones in weight.
Earlier this week, Steele made his latest attempt to escape from jail.
He and another inmate, armed robber John Croall, used a replica key to
unlock a number of doors at Perth Prison.
They had made their way to a part of the prison between the
accommodation hall and the outer perimeter before the security systems
worked and they were apprehended.
Contrary to some reports, the key was found but the prison locks were
changed as a precaution.
Steele has twice before escaped from custody, once giving himself up
by chaining and glueing himself to the gates of Buckingham Palace, and
on the second occasion -- after escaping with five others from a playing
field at Saughton Prison, Edinburgh -- by climbing the lighting and
camera tower outside the gates of Barlinnie Prison.
On both occasions, he could have remained at large but instead chose
to give himself up, he insists, to prove his innocence. His brother,
John, has said that had he succeeded in his latest escape bid he
intended chaining himself to the Eiffel Tower to make his protest
international.
In recent months, Campbell and Steele have been supported by a group
of sympathisers calling themselves the Free the Glasgow Two Campaign.
A campaign spokesman said: ''Everyone is angry and feeling frustrated
by this decision on Love, but to be honest it is exactly what we
expected from the Pontius Pilates at the Crown Office.''

THE Prime Minister last night set out his stall for the next General
Election, concentrating on Europe, Northern Ireland, and the
constitution. He ruled out any question of Britain joining a European
single currency in the next few years.
In a speech to Conservatives in London, Mr Major tackled these three
crucial issues head on and left no-one in any doubt about where he
stands and where he wants his party to stand.
On Europe, Mr Major said: ''Ambitious schemes for centralism simply
will not get through. Britain for one will not accept them. What we will
aim for is a more flexible European Union. That is the only way forward
which makes sense as Europe enlarges.''
He reassured those most fearful on Northern Ireland that there would
be no joint sovereignty, ''no joint authority between London and Dublin,
and no joint intervention by the British and Irish Governments''.
On the constitution: ''Some time ago, I said about Scotland that no
nation can be held within a Union against its will. Equally, the people
of Northern Ireland cannot and will not be forced out of the Union
against their will. They have a constitutional guarantee. For my part I
cherish the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland's part in it.''
He was most specific on Europe, which has bedevilled his Premiership.
''Talk of fast track and slow track misses the point. We do not all have
to do the same things at the same time in the same way and we shall
resist the pressure to do so. Unless Europe is flexible it will simply
grind to a halt.
''In the negotiations, a balance will have to be found between
competing interests. I have set out recently some areas where our
position is firm. Ken Clarke made the point again yesterday.
''We cannot accept that sterling should be part of a single currency
in 1996 or 1997. We do not believe that anyone could sensibly want to go
ahead then but, if they do, we would not be with them.
''Nor can we accept a prejudgement, one way or the other, about some
unknown time in the future. The right for our Parliament to take the
decision it wants when it wants is undoubted.
''That lies in the future. To say yes or no now is to operate on
hunch, not facts. No-one knows what future economic circumstances will
be. I will tell you my fear. Unless economic conditions were right, a
single currency would tear Europe apart.''
He said the Chancellor would go into further detail on these matters
next week.
On Ireland, the Prime Minister posed a series of questions and then
answered them himself. ''What about this plan for the British and Irish
governments to intervene jointly in Northern Ireland?''
Mr Major said: ''Let me put it very simply. There will be no joint
sovereignty, no joint authority between London and Dublin, and no joint
intervention by the British and Irish governments. I cannot be clearer
than that.''
Asking whether the people of Northern Ireland would be on a ''slippery
slope'', Mr Major said: ''Of course not. The consent principle is our
foundation stone. The parties must consent to any outcome and when they
do the people must consent in a referendum.''
The Prime Minister admitted that at the next election the stakes would
be high, with differences between the Tories and the Opposition on ''the
economy, on Europe, the constitution, health and education: right the
way across the present Government agenda''.
He warned that in ''the 1990s we can build on the great achievements
we have made since 1979 or we can throw it all away.''
He concluded: ''This fight matters as much as any we have conducted
before. These are the policies I believe in, these are the policies I am
going to fight for and with which I believe we will win.''
A more immediate struggle looms for Mr Major. There was a threat last
night of all-out civil war over the party's increasingly Euro-sceptical
stance. Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath warned Euro enthusiasts
in the party would reassert themselves.
He told BBC 2's Newsnight: ''We are to going to fight all out, and it
will be for a European Union in which we are at the heart of the
union.''

BRITAIN inside Europe making the rules would find it easier to ensure
the European Union did not stray beyond what was necessary to keep
markets working effectively, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in
Glasgow last night.
Speaking at the Scottish Oil Clubs annual dinner, Mr Hurd said there
was a message in that fact for those tempted to suggest the UK had
nothing to gain from rolling up its sleeves and engaging in the European
debate.
''In all areas of commerce and industry, the new markets and the
growing economies are not just new opportunities, they are new and
stiffer tests of our competitiveness,'' he said.
''Our response is not to retreat inside a fragile, protectionist
shelter, but to get out there and compete.''
He said that was why the Government had put so much emphasis on
enhancing competitiveness at home, and on promoting an international
business environment which rewarded strength rather than weakness.
Moreover, that was why it had twisted arms in Europe to keep the
Uruguay Round -- the Gatt trade talks -- on the rails.
''It was hard going, and we had a much longer journey than we would
have liked,'' he said. ''But what we got at the end was not an exhausted
puff of hot air. It was a breakthrough.
''On deregulation too, an alien and unpopular word not so long ago in
Brussels, we stuck to our conviction that it was an absolute essential
for success in tackling unemployment in Europe.
''Now that conviction, that meddlesome regulations cost jobs, is
widely shared.''
He added that the EU had its own experts looking for more
opportunities to cut away the unhealthy blubber of regulation.

<HEADLINE>Ferry passengers angered by 14-hour delay from Larne</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>980025622</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ANGRY passengers stormed off a ferry yesterday after being delayed for
14 hours.
The 133 passengers, including rugby fans on their way to today's
Scotland-Ireland match, boarded the ferry in Larne, Northern Ireland, at
6pm on Thursday.
They should have arrived at Stranraer at 8.15pm. But it was shortly
after 10am yesterday before the ship -- a Danish charter vessel --
docked.
The company blamed strong winds and a low tide for the delay.
But passengers said it was caused because the ferry, the MV Norrona,
had a foreign captain who was not familiar with the approach to
Stranraer harbour.
A spokeswoman from the company said: ''The Danish ferry -- on charter
to us while the normal ship is on refit -- has a Faroese master and
senior officers. But there is also one of our own captains on board to
act as pilot.
''The Faroese master is in charge and it was his decision not to go
into the harbour last night because of the winds and low tide.''
She added: ''I can understand that some of the passengers would not be
particularly happy. But our passenger services crew -- all our own staff
-- did everything possible to make them comfortable.
''We have given them a full refund of their return ticket. We have
also offered them refreshments and accommodation if they feel too tired
to continue with their journey.''
A Dumfries and Galloway Police spokesman said that, as usual, police
were present when the ferry docked.
He added: ''The police were aware that considerable disquiet existed
between some of the passengers and the ship's crew.
''However, the situation was resolved and the ferry was discharged
without the need for any police involvement.''
Stranraer residents said they had seen the ferry lying off the harbour
from about 9pm on Thursday.
One said: ''P &amp; O ferries were managing to sail in. I think that's
what would annoy a lot of people on board the Stena Sealink boat.''
The MV Norrona normally sails between Denmark and the Faroe Islands.

PROSPECTS of a facelift for the Forth Bridge are fading, the Scottish
Office has concluded.
The Transport Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, ordered an
inquiry after claims by Linlithgow MP Tam Dalyell that lack of painting
and maintenance had put the future of the 100-year-old rail bridge in
jeopardy.
Lord James announced yesterday that Railtrack had given firm
assurances that the bridge structure was absolutely safe. He said,
however, that its appearance was a cosmetic matter and as such would be
not eligible for an application to the Millennium Fund.
The Minister said any painting for cosmetic purposes would have to be
financed from other sources and he ruled out any Scottish Office
funding. However, there was the prospect of seeking charitable support.

THE Automobile Association admitted yesterday it was well off-track
with its award-winning 1995 edition of The Great Britain Road Atlas.
It has been voted ''Britain's clearest mapping'' by the public and the
new edition is fully updated with 3000 revisions.
But the atlas lists a non-existent road to one of the most remote
areas in the Highlands.
No-one has asked for a road to Scoraig, on Little Loch Broom in Wester
Ross, and one is not even planned.
The 70 local inhabitants remain just as isolated from the outside
world as they always have been.
Scoraig resident Hugh Piggott said: ''No matter what the AA says,
there are only two ways in here -- by boat or by Shanks's pony along the
five-mile long cliffside footpath.''
An embarrassed AA official admitted yesterday: ''We have got it wrong.
Everyone can make a mistake.''
She said the non-existent road would be erased from the 1996 atlas.

SCOTLAND and Ireland are both in the running for a #10m project that
could provide hundreds of jobs.
The company involved is Nokia Telecommunications, a division of the
large Finnish group, Noika. It is examining possible locations in both
countries for a plant to manufacture mobile telephone base stations. A
decision is expected within one month.
A spokesman for the Irish Industrial Development Association in Dublin
confirmed that negotiations with Noika were under way and said that
Noika officials had already inspected a number of sites in Ireland.
''This is one of the most important international projects on offer
for some time and it will be certainly be among the most sought after in
Europe this year,'' he said.
However, Scotland appears to have an advantage as Noika already has a
project office in Dunfermline.
The base stations, which are sold to mobile telephone operators,
effectively act as transmitter and receivers.
Ireland and Scotland have been short-listed for the new manufacturing
plant because both have large pools of skilled workers available,
according to the the Industrial Development Authority in Dublin. Italy
is also bidding for the factory, which recently awarded Noika a major
national contract.

<RECORDNO>980025626</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS discrepancies in the allocation of housing repair grants by
Edinburgh District Council have been officially admitted by the
council's director of housing.
He promised yesterday, following the publication of an independent
review by consultants, that departmental improvements already carried
out would clear the backlog of grants and improve the quality of service
to home owners.
Mr Mark Turley admitted that the findings of the investigation he
ordered had identified a number of areas which required improvement.
He said it was ''regrettable'' that calculations had been flawed. The
council at one point was looking to resources of #17m when, in fact,
#26m was required.
It would take two years to clear the backlog of grant applications,
said Mr Turley. He was confident the gap could be closed, particularly
with the allowance of an additional #2m from Scottish Office funding.
The wide ranging six-month investigation revealed considerable cause
for concern over the administration of grants, with 11 justifiable
complaints found among 40 registered. Seven are still unresolved.
Mr Turley said the most common complaint was that owners undertaking
schemes, and assuming they would receive grant aid, found the housing
department had later set new levels.
This followed a situation in which consultants were not informing
either owners or the department about costs.
Mr Turley said he could not go into detail as several complaints were
subject to possible legal action, following complaints to the Royal
Corporation of Architects.
He also said two staff members had been dismissed following alleged
irregularities but could not discuss the matter as they were appealing
the decision.
Councillor Mary Milligan, housing committee convener, said: ''We were
very disturbed that some of the procedures resulted in some owners not
receiving the service we would have liked.
''We now have a precise action plan in which some changes have taken
place, and others will follow in the next few months.''

<HEADLINE>Labour calls for Waldegrave to go as calf Bill is blocked Clashes at airport and the House</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>980025627</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE storm over animal rights intensified last night, with Labour calls
for the Agriculture Minister to resign and fierce protests at Coventry
airport as calf airlifts resumed.
Mr William Waldegrave was accused of orchestrating the blocking of an
attempt to stop calves being exported to foreign veal crates. Labour MP
Eric Martlew said his Private Member's Bill was scuppered by the ''most
disgraceful'' display of parliamentary time-wasting he had seen.
The calf airlifts started again at Coventry only two days after
31-year-old Jill Phipps died during a protest.
Her father and sister were among eight people arrested at Coventry
airport after protesters broke through the perimeter and ran on to the
flight apron. They were trying to stop a plane-load of calves taking
off. Later 32 protesters were arrested for public order offences at the
main airport gate.
Coventry City Council officials warned that people arrested for
breaching security at the airport could face fines of up to #5000 or six
months in prison.
In another development, the militant Animal Liberation Front hinted it
could start to play a bigger part in opposing the livestock export
trade.
A furious Mr Martlew said Conservative MPs had deliberately lengthened
the debate on another issue to prevent his proposals being discussed.
There were protests as Mr Oliver Heald, Mr Waldegrave's parliamentary
private secretary, embarked on a 24-minute speech mainly reviewing the
ancient history of the Olympic Games.
''We have seen the most disgraceful display of filibustering that I
have witnessed in eight years as a Member of Parliament,'' said the
Carlisle MP. ''What we had was a move to stop democracy working and I
will call on the Minister of Agriculture to resign.''
However, he said the Government was mistaken if it thought its tactics
would make the issue ''go away''. Public opinion would eventually bring
about the downfall of calf exporters, he said.
Mr Elliot Morley, Opposition spokesman on animal welfare, said: ''This
is a shameful day for the Government and demonstrates the hypocrisy of
their statements compared with their actions on tackling animal welfare
concerns.''
Compassion in World Farming, the welfare group at the forefront of
opposition to live exports for slaughter, said Mr Waldegrave had behaved
dishonourably.
Mr Waldegrave believes any unilateral ban would breach EU free trade
law and is confident of persuading other member states to impose a
Continent-wide ban on the crate-rearing system, outlawed in Britain
since 1990.
Earlier, Phoenix Aviation resumed flights from Coventry after
suspending operations when Ms Phipps was crushed beneath the wheels of a
lorry on Wednesday.
Phoenix said it realised the decision was controversial but felt it
owed a duty to its staff, customers, and British agriculture.
The move outraged welfare groups, and is certain to fuel the present
discontent.
The Russian Aeroflot twin prop Antonov was loaded with its cargo
during the morning while many protesters were attending the opening of
the inquest into the death of Ms Phipps.
Her father Robert and sister Lesley were arrested, according to Mr
Justin Timpson, the dead woman's boyfriend.
Mr Timpson said: ''I cannot believe the flight went ahead. As far as
we were concerned it was postponed, possibly until next week.''
He was among protesters who broke on to the flight apron and
criticised the manner of the arrests. Protesters were walking away after
the flight had taken off when police in riot gear jumped on them from
their vans, he claimed.
Half the officers wore jerkins covering up their numbers, he added.
Mr Phipps had indicated he was giving himself up when the police
roughly arrested him, Mr Timpson said.
''The police came down and were jumping on people -- Bob is 70 years
old and has a heart problem. It was completely out of order,'' he added.
It emerged yesterday that Ms Phipps, who had a nine-year-old son, had
been an Animal Liberation Front sympathiser for many years and had a
conviction for an attack on a factory.
Alf, whose members were involved in an attack on the home of Phoenix
chief Chris Barrett-Jolley on Thursday, said her death would not be in
vain.
''I am not here to issue any idle threats,'' said a spokesman for the
group. ''But obviously what has happened to Jill has intensified our
anger.''
Ten people were arrested during a demonstration at Brightlingsea,
Essex. On Thursday night five were arrested, and two police officers
hurt, during clashes at Plymouth.

Summit Reunion 1992 (Chiaroscuro)
* NOT quite as powerful as the first reunion of the born-again Soprano
Summit, this is nevertheless excellent stuff. And what a band: Kenny
Davern (clarinet), Bob Wilber (clarinet, alto, soprano sax), Dick Hyman
(piano), Bucky Pizzarelli (guitar), Milt Hinton (bass), Bobby
Rosengarden (drums), and veteran tenor saxophonist Flip Phillips
guesting on three of the 10 tracks. Highlights include a classy,
multi-layered Moonglow; one of the swingingest ever Lady Be Goods; a
Solitude to savour and a marathon, 11-minute Apex Blues. Catch Summit 94
in Edinburgh this summer.
The Genius of George and Ira Gershwin (Warner Bros Publications)
* AN investment for aspiring party-pianists who haven't already
committed the Gershwin brothers' repertoire to memory. All the classics
are here, although the level of playing ability for them varies.
Disappointingly, some numbers feature slightly stodgy arrangements, and
only an improviser will be able to do them justice. But other songs --
including He Loves and She Loves and Do, Do, Do -- are performable as
published. Certainly the best Gershwin volume this amateur ivory-tinkler
has yet discovered.
Soprano Summit (Chiaroscuro)
* LONG-overdue reissue of two of the seventies supergroup's albums,
Chalumeau Blue and Crazy Rhythm, plus some previously-unreleased live
numbers. All an absolute treat, especially as owners of the few LPs
which the band did make are understandably reluctant to loan them out.
On both, Kenny Davern and Bob Wilber try to out-soar each other on
soprano saxes and clarinet, while guitarist Marty Grosz hums, strums and
is the outfit's backbone, holding the sound together like glue. The
tunes -- mainly old and obscure -- combine stylish arrangements and
astonishing improvised solos and duets.

TARTAN Army terrorist Andrew McIntosh was given leave yesterday to
lodge an appeal, more than a year after his conviction and 12-year
sentence.
In December 1993, McIntosh, 39, was found guilty after trial at the
High Court in Aberdeen of being part of a conspiracy by the Scottish
National Liberation Army aimed at forcing the Government to grant
independence for Scotland.
He was also convicted of firearms offences and of charges involving a
letter bomb and hoax bomb campaign.
McIntosh, who worked for an oil service company in Aberdeen, was a
self-styled cell commander of the SNLA.
When he was arrested in August 1993, a search of his flat in George
Street, Aberdeen, uncovered a bomber's timetable and an array of weapons
including a copy of a Russian Kalashnikov and a pump-action shotgun.
Mr Andrew Hardie, QC, Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, told the Court
of Criminal Appeal yesterday that shortly after the end of the trial an
appeal against conviction and sentence was lodged on McIntosh's behalf.
It was due to be heard on May 25 last year.
However, on the day before the hearing, McIntosh's solicitor
telephoned him in prison and advised him that the appeal should be
abandoned.
The lawyer had apparently misunderstood the opinion of senior counsel
that although two grounds of appeal were unstateable, a third ground,
though difficult, could have been argued.
Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, sitting with Lords Allanbridge
and Brand, said that in light of the solicitor's incomplete and, to some
extent, inaccurate advice, McIntosh had signed a form abandoning the
appeal.
That would normally have been an end of the matter but, the court
heard, McIntosh had a chance conversation with a fellow prisoner. He
discovered that he should have been advised of his right to seek a
second opinion and could have appeared personally to argue his case
before the appeal court.
Lord Hope said the appeal court had agreed that in the exceptional
circumstances of the case it would be in the interests of justice to
allow McIntosh to appeal.
The appeal will be heard at a later date.

STERLING faced its biggest political crisis yesterday since its
departure from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, (ERM) in 1992.
Stories circulating in the world's financial markets of the possible
fall of the Major Government prompted investors to dump the pound.
A combination of worries over the Northern Ireland peace initiative
and fears of a backlash against Mr Major from pro-European Tories
concerned about the Cabinet's increasingly Euro-sceptic stance, are the
cause of the pound's problems.
The main editorial in this week's Economist magazine, entitled ''How
the government could fall'', was cited by nervous US investors as
reasons for their concern about holding sterling assets.
The Economist noted the devastating effect that pro-European Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd could have if he broke ranks as Lord Howe did in
Baroness Thatcher's government. ''It might mean the end of Mr Major; or
the fall of his Government; or both.'' This, together with similar
comments from UK analysts, upset the sterling apple cart.
The pound sank against virtually all major currencies, losing more
than one and a half pfennigs against the German mark to DM 2.3880, its
lowest level in five months and below the psychologically important DM
2.3900. It was also down against the US dollar, dropping one and three
quarter cents to $1.5649.

COMEDIAN Spike Milligan proved unrepentant yesterday as he collected
the Oldie of the Year award for calling the Prince of Wales a ''little
grovelling bastard''.
The 76-year-old former Goon followed it up by telling a rude joke
involving the Prince and a sperm bank.
His description of Charles, at the British Comedy Awards two months
ago, could now be added to the Prince's long list of titles, said the
chairman of the judges, Rumpole author John Mortimer.
''The Prince has always spoken well of the Goons -- no doubt he
regards himself as an amateur Goon himself -- so it was a brave thing to
say.''
A prize as Big Brother of the Year went to the Prime Minister's older
brother Terry Major-Ball, 62, whose book -- Major Major: Memoirs of an
Older Brother, published last year -- charts his family's background in
the circus and garden gnome business.
''It's been suggested I should start writing political speeches
next,'' said Mr Major-Ball. ''A lady on the train said she hadn't
understood a word the book was about so she thought I would be ideal for
political speeches.''
The Prince of Wales was nominated for his own award, as Wannabe Oldie
of the Year, but it went instead to his friend, Defence Minister
Nicholas Soames, nicknamed ''Bunter''.
''I'll borrow Hugh Grant's words and say any Minister receiving an
award of any sort must be grovellingly and touchingly grateful,'' said
Mr Soames, a grandson of Sir Winston Churchill.
Left-wing MP Tony Benn, 69, took the campaigner award for his attack
on Commons' privileges. His prize was collected by Lady Castle.
Another winner was actress Barbara Windsor, 57, ''for her patient
motherhood of Phil and Grant Mitchell in EastEnders''.
A tribute to Private Eye's proprietor Lord Gnome -- comedian Peter
Cook, who died last month -- came from award-winner Larry Adler.
He produced a harmonica and said: ''I wanted to play in memory of
Peter Cook -- and while I am at it, let me add Donald Pleasence and Fred
Perry.''
Adler, 80, was Oldie Pop Star of the Year after entering the Guinness
Book of Records in 1994 for being the oldest named artist to feature in
the British charts, with his Gershwin album.

THE Irish Government urged Britain to join the IRA prisoner release
programme yesterday, hours after another five people serving sentences
for terrorist-related offences were set free in the Republic.
Taoiseach John Bruton said there should be a reward for those who
abandon violence, and called on the Tories to match his decision. He
said: ''I would like to see the British Government looking at their
policy of prisoner release. It would be helpful.
''There's confidence when people can see that the abandonment of
violence brings rewards for those families who are separated from their
loved ones.''
However, the Northern Ireland Office rejected his plea. A spokesman
said the position remained the same: no amnesty because ''those
convicted in the courts must serve their sentence according to the
law''.
The releases, and Mr Bruton's comments, added to the controversy over
the Government's Northern Ireland policy, set off by the leak of the
framework document on relations between Dublin and the North.
Five members of the IRA, including the only female member of the
organisation held in Ireland, were given early release yesterday
afternoon, bringing to 14 the total released since Dublin initiated the
scheme before Christmas.
Unionist reaction was immediate and angry. They warned Mr Major any
step towards releasing terrorists would threaten the peace process and
the Government's relations with Unionist MPs, on whom it depends for its
slender majority.
Ulster Unionist MP John Taylor said: ''I am totally against it. Why
should those who commit terrorist offences be given preferential
treatment over those who are in prison for non-terrorist crime?''
Unionists' suspicions were echoed by some Conservative MPs. Mr Andrew
Hunter, chairman of the Tory back-bench Northern Ireland committee,
said: ''I acknowledge John Bruton's good intentions, but he is
profoundly mistaken. The premature release of IRA prisoners is a
monumental miscalculation and the Prime Minister has been right to
resist this to date.
''It is entirely wrong to seek to appease the IRA. The fact of the
ceasefire does not mitigate or ameliorate their horrendous crimes.''
In Northern Ireland, the nationalist SDLP and Sinn Fein welcomed the
news. Sinn Fein vice-president Martin McGuinness called on the
Government to stop ''foot-dragging'' on the issue and follow Dublin's
lead.
The four men released -- Patrick Flanagan, 54; John McBride, 24;
Stephen Sheedy, 35; and Ken Gaffney, 33, -- were serving sentences for
non-violent crimes.
The woman released, Pamela Kane, 30, had less than three years to
serve of her 10-year conviction for involvement in a bank robbery. She
was met by family and friends armed with flowers as she stepped out of
Limerick prison.

A BANK manager accused of embezzling #163,000 was seen stealing money
12 years ago, a court was told yesterday.
Clydesdale Bank worker Carol Ward told the High Court in Glasgow that
she saw Hector MacGillivray, 54, pocketing bank notes.
She told Advocate-depute Valerie Stacey that she reported the matter
to her superior.
She said: ''I felt shocked and embarrassed at having to report him
because he had been a friend for some time.'' She was told later that
the money had been put back, she said.
Mr MacGillivray, of Thomson Drive, Bearsden, also allegedly asked his
boss to change old notes which he said he had inherited, the court
heard.
The bank's retired cashier, Mr William Nelson, 69, of Birth Road,
Troon, said that used notes for burning had bore holes with wire through
them.
He said up to #2m was incinerated at a time in the bank's Glasgow
headquarters.
Mrs Stacey asked if he had thought it unusual for a member of staff to
say that he had inherited #11,000 from relatives in old notes found in
the back of a wardrobe. He said ''No.''
Mr MacGillivray denies the charge and the trial continues on Tuesday.

Writer May Sarton, now in her eighties, is uncovering fresh insights
into the predicament of youth. Jean Donald reviews her work
LIVE life now as you want to live it. You don't get any second
chances. It's hardly a new philosophy, but May Sarton is a poet and
writer who is still living life to the full at the age of 82 and has
every right to stress the importance of not being side-tracked, of being
aware of what life has to offer.
Two years ago her 80th birthday celebrations included a national
literary festival in her honour and the kind of conference Americans go
overboard on with discussion subjects like, Themes of Death And Grief in
the Work of May Sarton.
Known for the brittle candour of her writing style, she is also a role
model for the growing number of elderly -- in 20 years more than a
quarter of European citizens will be over 60 -- who tend to be looked
upon as simply a growing financial problem for the welfare services.
She is best known for her books on ageing, and her lesbian dalliances
in her Bloomsbury days, but her work also displays an acute
understanding of the young. She remembers her own youth clearly and
feels for the young who may look at society in the 1990s and decide they
don't want any part of it, at least as it is at the moment.
When one of her characters explains: ''I don't want to achieve. I just
want to be'', she doesn't go on to dismiss them as unrealistic or
irresponsible.
In her usual perceptive way she leaves it to other characters in her
latest book to find that there is a lot of truth in such youthful
outbursts. In Kinds of Love (Women's Press, #6.99), her characters
analyse their own lives and wonder just what their motivation was in
their younger years -- money, power, or did they just do what was
expected of them, and join the rat race?
Her characters are all too transparent in their predictability but
Sarton's genius is in revealing their touching humanity and
vulnerability.
One couple realise it has taken retirement and the husband having a
stroke (which Ms Sarton suffered herself almost 10 years ago) before
they had time simply to be together and enjoy the world around them.
''For the first time in our lives we have experienced a time of what you
would call 'just being', I suppose, and I grant you that it has been
very rich and wonderful,'' the husband admits. ''But I have a sort of
feeling that we earned it, through a rather long life of hard work,
bringing up children, keeping them afloat, and so forth.''
But young people want to live for today. Ms Sarton certainly did.
Born in Britain, she now lives in Maine, the same part of America in
which her new novel is based, and as most of her work is
autobiographical one can assume that the characters and the world in
which they live are pretty near to home.
She knows about the freezing New England winters when people are
trapped by snowdrifts, the frequent power cuts, the dependence of
neighbours, the way the poor and the rich are forced to help each other
to get through another winter. ''The people who are the old world, soon
there will be no more of their kind, rare as some rare wild flower being
bulldozed away.''
She still writes poetry -- Coming Into Eighty, which includes some of
her earliest as well as her latest works, is published in Britain later
this year, as is her autobiographical I Knew a Phoenix -- but nowadays
her routine has changed. She waits for inspiration until the small hours
when her cat demands to be let out. ''He likes to go out between one and
two in the morning, so there I am with no letters to write, nothing to
disturb me. And I've got to stay awake to let him in.''
Her early childhood was spent in England with her artist mother,
Mabel, then they moved for a few years to Belgium where her father was
an eminent historian before the family had to flee to America as
refugees during the First World War.
''I had attempted to make a go of starting my own theatre company in
the early 30s, unfortunately at the height of the Depression.''
She arrived back in London at the age of 25 in 1937. ''I'd had a very
responsible life but now I was simply a charming young woman. I loved
everyone and everyone was in love with me.'' She was introduced to
Bloomsbury society which fascinated her.
''I'd listen to these conversations in terribly Oxford English and
couldn't understand a word but they were inspirational people. I was
very much in love with Elizabeth Bowen and knew Virginia Woolf fairly
well. She used to invite me to tea every so often. I think she just
wanted to know about other people's lives, how I dressed, which books I
read, who I was in love with.''
She wrote about her affair with Bowen in her first novel but the
characters were disguised as male and female. She waited until the 1970s
before publishing her best-selling Mrs Stevens Hears the Mermaid
Singing, a book which again uses age as a central viewpoint.
Now she says she just amazed to have lived such a long life and is
extremely grateful ''to be still enjoying every moment. I always thought
my work would be appreciated but not until after my death.''
Her first book of poems and one novel had been published before
Virginia Woolf's suicide and May admits a selfish sense of loss because
she felt there was no-one else whose opinion mattered. She knew that
Virginia had not liked the first novel particularly, partly because one
page was obviously in Woolf's style. But that was long ago and May
Sarton has certainly come of age.

Kennedy Wilson considers a popular way of increasing your living space
without buying a bigger house
A PLATFORM bed is not only an eye-catching feature but one of the most
dramatic ways of creating more space in a small room.
Quite apart from bringing into use the entire floor space, children of
all ages like the idea of a raised platform indoors -- so redolent of a
tree house hideaway. And many parents admit that the novelty of climbing
a ladder to go to bed never really wears off.
Obviously, safety measures like rails have to be put in. And, it must
be said, this isn't a bed for the elderly or infirm. If you suffer from
back pain clambering up into a bed can feel like competing in an
obstacle course.
In single room studio apartments a platform bed really comes into its
own, if ceiling height permits. It can transform a dingy bedsit into a
sophisticated and trendy living space.
The platform bed raises the business of sleeping to a different level,
and therefore in some way distances it from the other activities in the
room. In a small flat a platform bed can help dispel the unease that
dinner guests might feel having to eat in a living-room which also
serves as sleeping quarters.
When the property market is sluggish, platform beds achieve greater
popularity as people with children decide to reorganise space to
accommodate the family rather than move to a larger house.
Gordon Russell, of GY Renovations which specialises in platform beds,
explains: ''Say when the children start to get a bid older and the
family is short of space and need to move but can't afford to they'll
put in a platform bed to give space up and space under.
''Even with interest rates low now, people are still putting platforms
in. A lot of people who work from home are putting a desk under the
bed.''
People who want a home office often opt for a platform bed, although
it must be said that a workspace under a platform can be either cosy or
claustrophobic depending on your point of view.
If having an office under your bed sounds a bit like taking work home
with you, you could opt for a walk-in storage cupboard, bookshelves or
wardrobe for clothes.
''Edinburgh is very good for platform beds. Because of the high
ceilings you can have six-foot clearance underneath,'' adds Gordon
Russell.
There's a definite science to building a platform bed and you have to
be pretty sure of what you are doing if you plan to do it yourself. The
wooden construction has to be able to take the weight of one (or more)
people.
Gordon Russell makes his platform beds from red pine and large frame
fixing bolts. ''Of course the wall you fit it to has to be solid,'' he
says.
Often platform beds can look pretty basic. Drapes and soft furnishings
may help. Red pine beds take on a good colour as the wood ages which
helps soften their appearance. Painting and staining the wood can also
make a platform bed look more at home. There's also the option of
chamfering or smoothing the edges of the crossbeams and downposts.
If you're not thinking of moving for a few years a platform can be a
real investment and an ideal solution to a storage space problem. Like
fitted kitchens, most people leave a custom-made platform bed behind
when they leave. A platform is not a permanent structure and planning
permission is not required.
The cost of a platform bed can vary from #240 for a single to #1000
for a big double bed with hanging space, headboard, and a proper
staircase.

Laura Thompson. THE DOGS (Vintage #6.99).
* THE second most popular spectator sport in Britain it may be, but
dog racing has always been the victim of a very British prejudice.
Accused of encouraging gambling and being crooked -- unlike, say, horse
racing -- it remains marginalised, dismissed as the hokey beguilement of
a sullen underclass. Laura Thompson fights the greyhounds' corner with
passion in this pawky history of her favourite pastime. Part
autobiography (her father was a trainer), part explication of the
sport's low-rent charms, The Dogs is a fascinating appreciation of the
flash and glamour of the fastest creatures in captivity. A pony on the
four dog, please . . .
Joe McGinniss. THE LAST BROTHER (Warner, #7.99).
* WHERE the careers of his brothers both ended with a bang, the
political life of Teddy Kennedy is concluding with a whimper. Ever since
Chappaquiddick it's been a humiliating slide into irrelevance for the
younger brother who became an old man while no-one was looking.
McGinniss has assembled a racy and readable biography, distinguished by
its tone of elegiac pity, and never stronger than when Bobby reveals the
family's history of involvement with payola and the Mafia to his
shell-shocked sib. The rest reveals a man singularly ill-equipped to
carry a load of history no-one anticipated would be his, and America's,
burden.
Nicholson Baker. THE FERMATA (Vintage, #5.99).
* ARNO STRINE is a 35-year-old temporary secretary in Boston, consoled
in his lowly employment status by being constantly in the company of
attractive young women. Having perfected the ability to stop time and
undress his colleagues, he writes this bashful autobiography of an
undetected fetishist, speculating drily on the moral implications of his
furtive unfetterings and weaving improbable fantasias around the human
animal in a succession of unnatural habitats. Propounding a view of sex
that's both functional yet strangely spiritual, Baker writes of the
modern obsession in ways that alert us to the ritualised and
superstitious nonsense surrounding the subject, in a book that's as
thought-provoking as it is bizarrely funny.
Angelo Maria Ripellino. MAGIC PRAGUE (Picador, #9.99).
* ALTHOUGH it sounds like a brochure from the Czech Tourist Board,
this peculiar and extraordinary book defies classification. Part
personal meditation, part historical excursion, part literary Baedeker,
it draws on Prague's rich artistic legacy to draft a rough guide to the
city's charms, something like a join-the-dots puzzle without numbers.
Kafka, in particular, looms over its pages just as the Castle looms over
the city, and as he wanders through the mytho-poetic labyrinth
Ripellino's dream-like monologue darts from past to present, fact to
fantasy, continually changing sources in mid-stream. This crazy cruise
is irresistible, if at times incomprehensible, mirroring the Bohemian
capital's mystic power and its genius for genius.
Ernest Hemingway. THE GARDEN OF EDEN (Vintage, #5.99).
* IN this unfinished novel, American author David Bourne is on a
seemingly idyllic honeymoon in Europe. His unbalanced wife, Catherine,
however, is a prisoner of gender who persuades him to indulge her sexual
role-playing fantasies and who boyishly bobs her hair (the couple's
coiffures are dealt with in such detail that the book might have been
subtitled The Salon Also Rinses). When Catherine embarks on a lesbian
affair and then offers hubby the forbidden fruit, the precarious menage
that ensues threatens to destroy all trois of them. Hemingway toiled for
15 years at this, but despite occasional brilliance, much of it reads
like self-parody.
Robert Littell. THE VISITING PROFESSOR (Faber, #4.99).
* A CAMPUS novel plotted apparently by rote -- duck-out-of-water
professor finds there's more to life than books, courtesy of an
eye-opening sexual encounter with an academically lacking but
emotionally intelligent nymph -- The Visiting Professor carries all the
baggage of a genre that has gone beyond saturation point. The professor
in question is Lemuel Falk -- a Russian expert on chaos theory who, you
just know from page one, is going to find himself up to his doctorate in
high jinks he never thought himself capable of. He becomes a celebrity
after his part in an anti-nuclear waste demo; shacks up with a
22-year-old hairdresser, and suffers the unwelcome attentions of the
Mob, the FBI, and a host of foreign powers out to snare his talents as a
codebreaker. A satirical romp that never makes the grade: Robert
Littell's report card should read must do better.
Sisters of the hard cell in love and war
Agnes Rossi. SPLIT SKIRT (Mandarin, #5.99).
* BASICALLY a low-calorie version of Kiss Of The Spider Woman, Agnes
Rossi's femme-bonding prison story overcomes most of its built-in
weaknesses as we follow an ill-assorted pair of cellmates through their
three-day stretches in Bergen County jail. Classy, conservative,
middle-aged Mrs Tyler is in for compulsive shoplifting; 27-year-old wild
child Rita for drunk driving and possession of cocaine. As their forced
relationship moves from politeness to affection and respect via
hostility and outright loathing, Rossi manages to avoid the pitfalls of
prissiness, piety, and tweeness, creating instead two realistic and
likable portraits of sisters in trouble. Good film material, too: Susan
Sarandon and Rosanna Arquette for the leads?
John Aizlewood (ed). LOVE IS THE DRUG: Living As A Pop Fan (Penguin,
#8.99).
* THAT subtitle should read Living As A Music Journalist -- most of
the contributors being contributors to Q, Select et al, and the
collection comprising 17 pompous pontifications that usually end with
When I eventually met my idol . . . . Full of exclamation and simpering
tweeness, it's as though writing about juvenile preoccupations demanded
a juvenile style, and although Sheryl Garratt (on the Bay City Rollers)
and Sean Hughes (on Julian Cope) manage to infuse humour and
self-deprecation into their confessions, most of these essays are as
fascinating as a stranger's holiday snaps.
Gideon Wurdz. THE FOOLISH DICTIONARY (Pryor Publications, #3.50).
* IF the author's name is insufficient warning (''giddy on words'',
ho-ho), you should be told that this is a reprint from 1904 of an
obscure example of the Phunny Phellow school of American comic
literature. It is a watered-down version of Ambrose Bierce's The Devil's
Dictionary, not nearly as black or bitter as that adder-tongued old
cynic's wordbook, but not without the odd pearl of wit and wisdom
nestling in its turn-of-the-century American nacre. Titian, for
instance, is defined as ''the colour a poor red-headed girl's hair
becomes as soon as her father strikes oil'', and dead as ''Without life.
See Boston''.
Paul Auster. MR VERTIGO (Faber, #5.99).
* WHEN nine-year-old St Louis guttersnipe Walt Ralley is approached by
a mysterious top-hatted figure with a plan to make them both
millionaires by teaching our young hero to fly, Walt is, to say the
least, sceptical. But with no prospects, no parents, and only the back
of his mean-spirited Uncle Slim's hand to look forward to, Walt goes
along for the ride and is soon embroiled in an adventure worthy of his
namesake. By 1927, same year as Lindbergh's historic flight, a
12-year-old Walt is putting on an aerial display of his own, and soon
the wonder boy has gripped the imagination of the whole USA. Walt's rise
and fall is played out alongside that of America itself in this
delightful and unusual allegorical tale.

Lindsay Kemp always knew he was God's gift to the theatre, and to
ballet . . . but the gift comes with very strange packaging indeed.
Jackie McGlone talks to the fallen angel who gave Ziggy his stardust.
LINDSAY KEMP snatches up the latest magazine cutting about himself and
all his works. ''Oh my Gaaad!'' he screams, closely examining his
photograph. ''I look like a lesbian novelist.'' And you are forced to
agree with him. Wearing a butch little cap, simpering modestly, with
hands demurely crossed in his lap, he does indeed owe more to Gertrude
Stein than Rudolph Nureyev. A pose is a pose is a pose . . .
We are seated -- the sacred monster of British theatre, sometime cult
''heroine'' of dance and erstwhile lover of David Bowie, and your
reporter -- in the foyer of a London hotel. We are the cabaret for the
passing caravanserai of bewildered guests. The turquoise blue
tartan-suited Kemp is singing to me, Falling in love with love is
falling for make-believe . . . slightly off-key, waving his arms around
like a demented windmill, dragging on his Yves St Laurent cigarettes,
and speaking in a very loud voice about his belief in angels.
Of course he believes in angels, he announces. He owes everything to
his angels -- the good ones and the dark ones. He is pulled between
them. His favourites are St Michael and St Jerome, Isadora Duncan,
Picasso, Garcia Lorca, and Oscar Wilde. And then there are his shadow
angels. For is his not a life, he asks, which has always been
precariously balanced between the angel of death and the angel of life?
But angels are at a premium, he has found, although he leaves his
window open every night just in case . . . So far all he has got is a
mouthful of mosquitoes and not a single feather. In Spain and Italy --
he lives in Rome -- they believe in angels. ''They don't believe in
angels in England. But then they don't believe in magic either. They
don't believe in duenda -- the soul, the spirit. Oh yes, the angels are
my friends. Mind you, one can't go around with the reputation of being
an angel, can one? That never gets you into bed . . . '' By this time
the taxi drivers lunching at the next table are goggle-eyed.
Sex? Well, people often say of him that that is all he is interested
in. ''Darling,'' he says, in a stage whisper that can probably be heard
on the other side of the street, ''it is what we are all really
interested in. It is what my mother used to say, affairs of the heart
are what keep us all going. From I was about three, she told me, 'Love?
It's what makes the world go round, Lindsay'. After my father died, I
had a lot of uncles, you know.'' Does he have a partner? ''Haven't you
heard? Oh my dear, you must have heard! Well, for 20 years I was with my
collaborator David Haughton, who was my Apollo, this handsome,
beautiful, wonderful man, when he upped and left me to get married last
year. To a woman! Ha! Haa! Haaa!
''I was abandoned! He was the brain behind a lot of what I did. He was
Jean Marais to my Cocteau. So life over the past year has been a bit
difficult to say the least. I don't just mean because I miss him in bed.
I miss him in my speeches and my letters, just getting me from one place
to another. But things are looking up. As you can see, things have
definitely cheered up,'' he says, downing a pint of Guinness and
indicating his startling hand-made cashmere suit.
A man would have to be in love or at least walking out with someone to
be wearing a suit like that, I point out. He preens. ''Isn't it
wonderful? Yes, I am seeing somebody. A wildly attractive young man. It
is just so essential, you see. Not just to avoid loneliness, but for
inspiration. I spin! My pirouettes are multiple pirouettes again.
Sometimes it's just a crush on someone which maybe I exaggerate. But it
speeds me up, it's where my energy comes from.'' Has he been in love
many times? ''Darling, I'm always in love,'' he replies and starts
singing a la Dietrich, Falling in love again . . . There have been three
real romances in his life. Three big love affairs.
Does he still see Bowie? (He was close adviser and lover to the singer
for whom he mounted the Ziggy Stardust concerts, thus infiltrating dance
into rock performance for the first time.) ''No, we went our different
ways. He got awfully grand, you know. As for me, I've always stayed the
same. Boys I went to school with, who are now awfully old, say to me,
'Lindsay, you haven't changed one bit'. I suppose I haven't -- I have
always been miles and miles out of the closet.'' All his life Kemp has
followed in the footsteps of Duse and Duncan but, as he puts it, ''in my
own mode, darling''.
During his Scottish period in the early 1960s he attracted a cult
underground Kemp following at the old Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh,
with his homoerotic scenarios, presenting works by Genet, Lorca, and
Shakespeare in what the critic Michael Coveney, in his book, The Citz,
described as ''a hothouse environment of nudity, emphatic make-up of
white face and carmine lips, explicit mime, lush and loud recorded
music, overt sensuality and audience-manipulating lighting effects.
''He both anticipated and influenced the (Giles) Havergal Citizens' in
that he brought elements of the new, fashionable androgyny, and the rock
concert, into the theatre.'' Indeed soon after Havergal arrived at the
Citizens' 25 years ago, Kemp directed an all-male version of Genet's The
Maids, a work which apparently radiated an awesome sense of sexual and
political danger. Kemp recalls walking around the Gorbals in flowing
caftan with rings on his toes -- ''I got a round of applause whenever I
went out''.
The Citizens' actor Laurance Rudic, who was dying a theatrical death
until he met and fell in love with Kemp, remembers the performer falling
for a boy in his 1969 show Flowers. He stopped mid-show (tanked up on
hash and gin) to declare in floods of tears that nobody loved him any
more. Meanwhile, Kemp's long-time collaborator, the Incredible Orlando,
bald, powerfully built, six feet tall, and almost completely blind, was
stuck halfway up a ladder, while Kemp exited to the dressing room,
weeping mascara'd tears of woe. More than 25 years later, Rudic claims
it was the most extraordinary night of his life, the night Lindsay Kemp
went crazy during a show. ''Oh, you heard about that, did you?'' says
Kemp. Oh well, he has this reputation for being decadent, but of course
he is only attracted by the colours of decadence.
We are talking though about a life which has been lived on the edge.
In the sixties, Kemp was into serious partying, tripping on acid and
sex. The drugs and the drink flowed. (''Stash the hash, boys, it's a
bust,'' shouted Kemp, exiting from a party with a policeman on each arm
and waving a fan in his hand.) Today he has given up drinking -- mainly
because the mornings after are so terrible. Indeed, he tells me, while
he is in London and on the current tour with his ''Gothic operetta''
Cinderella (''the Cinderella who dare not speak her name'') which comes
to Edinburgh next week, he will not touch a drop of any elixir.
Born in 1938 in ''posh Kirby on the Wirral'' (Kemp usually tells
interviewers he was born in Birkenhead because it's more colourful), he
is a Scottish sailor's son who taught himself to dance from a book
borrowed from Bradford public library. His glamorous, vivacious mother,
who died 18 months ago at the age of 86, adored him. He spent most of
his young life being over-indulged by her, having been conceived as the
replacement for a sister, who was apparently something of an infant
phenomenon. This all-singing, all-dancing prodigy died of meningitis at
the age of 5 -- ''she was over-intelligent for her age''. Then his
father was killed at sea during the war.
''So, in addition to having to be as good and as beautiful and as
charming and as popular and as admired as my little sister Norma, I had
to become a replacement for my mother's stalwart, valiant, handsome,
adoring, faithful (I'm not sure how many of these adjectives actually
apply because he was away at sea) husband. My mother worshipped me. She
lavished her life on me. Needless to say, she did everything in her
power to stop me from going on the stage. I was born with this twitching
disease, St Vitus's dance, or at least under the patronage of that
saint.
''My mother said to a neighbour, 'What shall I do with him?' To which
the reply came back, 'Put tap shoes on him, he could be the next Shirley
Temple'. So she did. And Highland dancing pumps. And a kilt. When I was
little I was encouraged to dance on the kitchen table, clicking my
home-made castanets. My mother loved it when the neighbours pressed
their faces up against the windows to watch me. But when I was still
tap-dancing on the table at 18, she got a bit worried.''
With enormous reluctance the budding ''Petula Clark of the
avant-garde'' attended a loathsome naval college (''I learnt no
seamanship skills; I can't even tie a knot''), went to school in South
Shields, became a window-dresser, studied painting at Bradford College
of Art, where one of his first dates was David Hockney, and then turned
his attentions to dance and mime. Rejection followed upon rejection as
he attempted to train for the ballet. From Sadler's Wells they wrote to
him that he was ''physically and temperamentally unsuited to a career as
a dancer''. If he had listened, he shrieks, what the world would have
lost! Imagine! That loss! ''I always knew I was God's gift to the
theatre, particularly to the ballet. But then came the years of doubt,
and I'm only just escaping from them.''
Rejection only made him the more determined. ''I was born a bull. I'm
stubborn, I'm a Taurus. Look at my huge feet,'' he says, kicking up his
sandalled heels. ''Do I not have bulls' hooves for feet? And look at my
hands -- fingers like sausages. I have Picasso hands because I'm a
fighter. I have always had to fight.''
In the RAF, he had ''a hellish time'', then came the years of dancing
in Blackpool in a show called Follies Striptease. He would perform in
the only garment he possessed and in black elastic-sided boots with his
face whitened. ''I used the name Lindzi. I got an engagement in Paris.
They were under the impression I was a stripper. The manager said,
'No-one must know you are not a woman'. But my G-string snapped one
night and the game was up and I was out on my neck. I danced in the
streets; I danced between wrestling bouts in northern clubs, Bradford
and Bury and Burnley. All they wanted was the wrestlers or the
strippers. They didn't want me. It was the way I learnt my trade of
enchanting, of hypnotising an audience like I did at school to stave off
the bullies. I was obliged of necessity to enchant with a different tale
each night.''
And on that stage, to avoid the beer glasses and the abuse, he had to
astonish, the way Cocteau astonished Diaghilev. ''Whatever they threw at
me, I'd throw something back. They threw bricks at me in the street in
England.'' On a Scottish Arts Council tour of the Borders he once pelted
a fur-coated wife of a headmaster with a plateful of meringues (''the
cleaning bills were horrendous'') because he heard her declaring after
his performance, ''Well, it isn't Mame is it?'' Kemp explodes: ''Of
course it wasn't bloody Mame! I am a serious artist. It just so happens
that my seriousness is disguised with frivolity. I have actually become
Gene Kelly and Moira Shearer and Robert Helpmann in The Red Shoes. I
have become all those people by imitating. What I mean is I have
discovered myself through my art. In all my work I encourage people to
dream, to live their dreams, however impossible. Look at me, I dreamed I
was Cinderella and that I was going to marry the prince. But, darling, I
am the prince.''
I could have talked, or rather listened, to Lindsay Kemp all day and
all night. He is a latter-day Scheherazade, spinning a tangled web of
tales about love and life, romance and sex. Unfortunately, there is
metal more attractive on the horizon. Photographers are due to arrive
and here he is rubbing his right eye and it's all red and inflamed.
''Have a I burst a blood vessel?'' he asks, anxiously. Would he care to
look in my handbag mirror? Better not, he says with a knowing wink.
He'll just have to ask them to photograph his left side and, dearie me,
there are blotches on his cheek. ''Ooooh, I'm ever so vain,'' he says,
with a sidelong, movie-queen glance. ''I simply can't resist cameras.
Point a lens at me and I immediately start posing.''
Does he never tire of posing and talking about himself? ''Darling, I
can't think of anything -- well I can, but enough of that -- which gives
me more pleasure. I love talking about me.''

<HEADLINE>Man says he buried wife at sea after storm hit yacht</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A MAN described yesterday how he was forced to bury his wife at sea
when a voyage went wrong, leaving their crippled yacht adrift for two
months on the Indian Ocean.
Mr Ashok Baljoresai, 54, whose last known address was in Ilford,
Essex, said their yacht, Dream Weaver, lost her mast in gale-lashed
seas, leaving him and Pamela Thompson, the woman of 65 he had just
married, struggling to survive.
He said she became ill and died two weeks later.
Mr Baljoresai was speaking from a Russian freighter which rescued him
and was due to dock in Fremantle, western Australia, around noon British
time today.
Police, customs, and immigration officials were waiting to speak to Mr
Baljoresai.
The couple left Singapore for Mauritius in September, two months after
their wedding. The trip was expected to take about a month.
Mr Baljoresai said the engines failed and the mast was smashed as the
30ft craft was battered by gale-force winds and mountainous seas on
November 28.
His wife developed stomach problems. He tried to feed her with their
meagre supplies, and burned pieces of the boat to purify the water.
He could not call for help on the radio because the batteries had
failed.
''She just ebbed away before me. I tried everything to save her, but
it wasn't enough.
''She just couldn't keep any food down and she was vomiting all the
time. I don't know what was wrong with her,'' he said from the rescue
ship, the Anatoly Vasaliev.
He added: ''I don't think it was the water, I think there was
something wrong internally. I had to bury her at sea. It was horrendous.
''But at sea you cannot do anything. She just seemed to give in.''
He put the body over the side and conducted her funeral. ''All I could
do was say a simple prayer and goodbye to the woman who had been my wife
for a matter of weeks. It was a simple ceremony, but I was left with no
choice.
''I knew I was dead if no-one rescued me, but there was nothing I
could do but read books and wait for something to happen.''
He was rescued on January 25, about 900 nautical miles south-east of
Mauritius.
The Russian ship was the first he had spotted during the voyage.
The captain, Petrov Kubilius, said Mr Baljoresai was ''quite sick and
very stressed'' when he was plucked from the yacht, but was now in a
satisfactory condition.
Australian customs spokeswoman Jenny Hodder said they were notified of
the incident by the ship's agents in Australia on January 27.

HUNDREDS of pensioners in Glasgow face having the rent on their
pre-war homes doubled by private landlords.
Western Heritable Investment Company Ltd has applied to increase the
annual rent on more than 600 properties in the city from #1860 to #3600.
There were heated exchanges yesterday as more than 200 pensioners
packed a church hall in the Kings Park area of the city for the first of
a series of private meetings being held before the rent officer, who
will decide on the level of increase.
The four-in-a-block cottage flats built in the 1920s and 1930s are
almost entirely occupied by the elderly, many who moved in when they
were built.
Mr John Maxton, MP for Glasgow Cathcart, who attended the meeting,
said: ''I think it is outrageous what Western Heritable are trying to
do.
''It is the old trick of making up a figure as high as possible and
hope that the rent officer sets a higher rent than he would have.
''These are very old people who are distressed by this, and it really
is very unfair of Western Heritable to put letters though their doors
making them think they will have to pay such increases.''
The demands have been met by defiance from the tenants. Retired police
officer William Paisley, 93, who lives in Croftfoot, said he would not
be paying the increase.
''I have been in this house for 64 years and up until the past three
years have done practically all the repairs myself because they were
trivial. Since then I have only called in the landlords twice.
''The rent is too high and what they are proposing is sheer robbery. I
will not pay it. I don't see the point of it. They know themselves they
won't get it.
''Western Heritable are asking me for about #140 a month more. For
what? The house wasn't falling down and they had to repair it. The men
they employ are not getting a big wage increase.''
Mr Thomas Rowlands, Glasgow manager of Western Heritable, said the
company had settled on #3600 because that was the annual rent the
properties could command on the open market.
''Last September we advertised two of these houses to let and stated
no price. We received 149 inquiries and 46 people attended the viewings.
We had 29 offers and eventually let the houses for #300 a month. The
properties were unfurnished.
''All we did was paint them. The new tenants are on exactly the same
tenancy agreement as the people involved in the meeting today.''
Mr Rowlands said Government benefits existed to help tenants who could
not afford their rent.
''Somebody said to me: 'Do you not think this is morally wrong? How
would you feel if it was your mother and father and they were unable to
pay?'
''My answer to that was that the Rent Act of 1984 brought in housing
benefit to take account of that. It decided that to try and hold the
decline in the private rented sector it would bring in a system whereby
the rent that someone gets for a house has nothing to do with the
personal circumstances of the occupier. If they can't pay they will be
helped out by housing benefit.
''I have great sympathy with people who are have pensions or savings
and perhaps don't qualify for full benefit.''
The tenants' case is being put to the rent officer by a number of
local councillors. Louise Fyfe, who represents Aikenhead ward presented
the bulk of the case before rent officer Alex Lindsay.
She argued that the Western Heritable properties were unimproved, and
rents in similar housing association flats -- which unlike many Western
Heritable houses had been double glazed and centrally heated -- were
cheaper.

THE ornamental border had an important role in Victorian design. Used
in carpets, mosaic floors, furniture, soft furnishings and sometimes
even clothing, the decorative border drew its design elements from
classical sources -- mainly architecture and geometry. Bands of stylised
flowers, leaves and other botanical specimens were also popular.
No longer an intrinsic part of an object, today's ornamental border is
presented as the finishing touch -- and, in some cases, a method for
creating an illusion. Whether you stencil it or buy it as tiles or a
wallpaper roll, the ornamental border can be used to advantage and for
many different effects.
Victorian homes, for example, often had hallway dados, sometimes wood,
sometimes heavily embossed paper, then painted and finished with a
wooden strip edging. The same dado effect can be recreated by decorating
your hallway with contrasting paint and paper: a dark striped paper
below, with light paint above.
In between comes the ornamental paper border -- to add additional
decorative emphasis to the division. Move the decorative border further
up the wall and you can pretend you have a picture rail -- another
optical illusion which will bring down the height of a too-tall ceiling.
Use two borders -- one half way and the other at ceiling height -- to
really emphasise a patterned paper.
Bathrooms too have traditionally featured a tiled or wooden area
installed half-way up a wall and behind the bath, while kitchens were
often painted with a practical gloss on the lower half of the wall and
eggshell above.
The wide availability of decorative paper borders gives every home
owner the opportunity to not only recreate some of the Victorian
interiors but also to experiment. Decorative edgings can be used in many
different situations -- to recreate Georgian-style panels on a painted
wall; to decorate a folding screen; to outline an unusual architectural
feature or bedroom window; to edge a kitchen shelf; to liven up a
children's room; or as an added frame around a hanging mirror. The
applications are endless.
If you wish to give the illusion of architectural detail, then try one
of the ornamental paper borders sold by Laura Ashley. Available in a
variety of colours, including a Victorian-style dark green, this
''Architectural'' range features a vine winding around a column. It is
well teamed with a dark-striped paper for a hallway dado. It's ''Egg &amp;
Dart'' border in stone, reminiscent of plasterwork, would add a subtle
architectural touch at ceiling height.
Laura Ashley also provides a selection of decorative paper borders for
children's rooms -- borders wide enough to give the feeling of a mural.
Choose from a country farm scene, the Owl &amp; Pussycat, the alphabet, a
circus or Noah's Ark and team up with co-ordinating paper. If you have
time to spend and want to try a stencilled border instead of one in
paper, then Laura Ashley can also provide with you the equipment. The
chain sells brass border stencils with shells, ducks, vines or roses,
and a selection of paints.
Crown Wallcoverings also give you ample opportunity to create that
finishing touch with ornamental borders. Their swimming dolphins design
adds a nautical touch to the bathroom while a colourful border of fruits
is well suited to the kitchen. Crown have decorative paper borders
especially for children's rooms -- including a bright parade of hippos,
crocodiles and lions and a selection of floral and geometric edgings
which can be co-ordinated with their papers.
The beauty of the decorative wallpaper border is that it is easily
applied -- giving maximum effect for little effort. What is more, it
gives the opportunity to link contrasting papers and paints and add
additional design.

THIS may be a gloomy time of year -- short days and keen winds -- but
it has its compensations. One of them is to catch sight of the tiny pink
blossoms of dawn -- viburnum bodnantense -- against the leaden grey of a
winter sky.
It can be quite breathtaking to come across this tree in full flower
as you walk along a suburban street. It is all the more spectacular
because the leaves appear after the flowers, so the tufts of creamy pink
blossom appear on its bare black branches.
Because of the mild November, this year they are blooming even earlier
than usual. A few sprays of this blossom cut and placed in a jug against
a plain wall, will bring fresh life to a room. No flower arranger can
ever resist bringing a few sprigs indoors.
Unfortunately, this type of viburnum prefers the outdoor chill of
winter and in a warm room the flowers will not last long but, even so,
it is well worth bringing a few inside, as they do cheer up the home
considerably -- even if only for a few days.
Any kind of blossom will last much longer if it is treated before
arranging -- a process flower arrangers call 'conditioning'.
Cut the woody stems at an angle with sharp secateurs, to expose the
maximum area of stem for the uptake of water. Shielding the blossom
heads in a brown paper bag, hold the stem ends in a pan of boiling water
for 10 seconds. Then immediately plunge them into tepid water for at
least two hours. After this they can be arranged in floral foam or
simply placed in a jug.
Other types of blossom, such as forsythia hamamelis mollis, other
types of viburnum and later in the month ribes sanguineum (flowering
currant) can be picked in tight bud and forced into early flower by
conditioning them and then placing them in a warm room in tepid water.
They will continue to grow and open out.
Although the blossom does not last as long as that picked in bloom
from the garden later in the year, it is a delight in the grey days of
winter and brings a sense of new life and hope with the coming spring.
Long arching sprays of most types of blossom look very graceful in
their own right and do not need contrived arranging. But the pale pink
blossoms of viburnum bodnantense are produced on short twiggy growths,
as opposed to long sprays and it will need additional foliage, since it
has none of its own. Any grey foliage from the garden or the variegated
grey-green pittosporum, which is also perfect for daffodils, is a good
foil for this blossom.
What you put the blossoms in can also enhance their appearance.
Crystal or glass is good, or any plain terracotta tub. A
highly-patterned tub may detract from the tiny flowers.
The container in the photograph is a pewter entree dish. The steel
grey colour is a perfect foil to the delicate pinks of the blossom and
it also picks up the same colour in the ornamental plates.
To make the display
* A small round block of Oasis foam, a plastic 'frog' on which to
impale the oasis and a tiny piece of Oasis fix to hold the frog in
place.
The foliage is the silvery grey of convolvulus cneorum, a small shrub
which looks good all winter and the single large leaves are cynara
candunculus (cardoon) and the flowers are supplied by branches of dawn
-- viburnum bodnantense.
* Press the oasis fix to the base of the frog and position it on the
dry dish slightly off centre to the left. Press the round of the soaked
floral foam on top.
* Insert the conditioned sprays of blossom first, to give a curving
outline with shorter sprigs at the base.
* Add four or five grey cardoon leaves to the back and sides and
position one leaf to curl over the lip of the container to the front.
* Add short springs of grey convolvulus to fill in at the base.
* Finally top up the container with water.

OF all the things which go bump in the night one of them is a
reassuring sound.
The soft clunk which indicates that the central heating pump has
clicked on is good news
One day there will not be a clunk and you will sleep bissfully on --
and wake up to a cold house.
The central heating pump always seems to fail on the coldest day of
the year.
Fortunately, central heating systems are usually designed to allow
easy replacement of a broken pump.
The first thing to do is to check which make and model you are seeking
to replace.
Having bought the replacement pump and a roll of plumber's PTFE tape
you can tackle the job fairly smoothly.
First, turn the heating off and make very sure that the electricity to
the pump is disconnected.
Take off the terminal cover on the pump and draw a diagram indicating
which wire goes where before disconnecting them.
Whoever designed your heating system should have placed a special
valve on either side of the pump to make it easy for it to be changed.
You may have a special handle to turn the valves off -- if not a
spanner will do. The water in the central heating system is now safely
confined to the pipework and you can use a large spanner to undo the
nuts securing the pump to the pipes. Hold the pump as you turn the nuts
to avoid damaging the pipes.
The pump will now simply slide out of position. It will have some
water inside it so stand by with a bowl and rags to catch the worst of
it and mop up the rest.
Wrap some of the PTFE tape around the thread on either side of the
pump to ensure a watertight finsh.
Before taking out the old pump you should make a note of the arrow on
the casing which indicates the flow of water. You simply slide the new
pump into position, making sure that the arrow points in the same
direction as before.
Tighten the nuts and open the isolating valves on either side to allow
water to flow into it. There will be a screw on the pump to allow you to
bleed the air out.
Now you simply connect the wires to the correct terminals in the pump,
replace the cover and switch the power back on.

EVEN in the depths of winter there's lots to be done in the garden. My
pergola was damaged in the recent gales and needed to be provided with a
strong support.
The ideal wood for this is larch, either in its natural state or
stripped and varnished, though you can use pressure-treated timber.
Fortunately I have a wood nearby which yielded some suitably straight
branches. With a few galvanised nails -- better than the steel ones
which can quickly rust -- I was soon able to construct a supporting
frame.
Then it was into the unheated greenhouse. Quite a few plants, such as
geraniums, had succumbed to the cold. I still use one of my borders in
the house for tomatoes. The thing is to give it a good soak with
Armillatox. Get this done as soon as possible, preferably on a mild day
when the chemical won't freeze.
Fumes can arise from chemicals used for sterilisation, so be careful
as these can be damaging to seedlings and established plants too.
Then I had a good look around and was happy to see daffodils in
sheltered spots, in full bud and looking as if they will flower soon.
Several shrubs are coming into bud, notably flowering currants. They
seem to be one of the first off the mark.
I was tempted to do a bit of pruning on my roses but decided to leave
well alone for some weeks yet. I would like to soak the ground with
Armillatox or Jeyes fluid before long, to kill off any blackspot spores.
The trouble is I have interplanted primroses. They would not take
kindly to any sterilising liquid. The answer is to move the primroses
and replant in an area where they can flower happily.
I have one or two hedges which require serious cutting back,
particularly a beech hedge blotting out a lot of the sun from the patio.
I have decided this is a job for a contractor friend. I have no place
where I can stack the considerable amount of prunings that will result.
My contractor loads them on his lorry, and off they go.
It is amazing how quickly the squad can get through a job like this. I
would footer away for hours on end, and several weekends, and still have
the problem of disposing of the prunings.
I have a corner I have ignored for years. Now it has developed, with a
mixture of conifer, ground cover plants and dwarf shrubs. There is a
background of never-failing cotoneaster horizontalis.
There was only one thing to do. Get on the gloves. Spread a bedsheet.
Trim away with secateurs, and loppers. You may even need a good saw.
Whatever you do, be artistic with the trimming back. Stand back and
look at what you are doing. With the mixture of prunings, this would be
an ideal time to invest in a shredder.
It can make nice mulch, but it does take time, and rather longer than
taking the stuff to the nearest dump. There is no question of trying to
do everything in a day. This is the sort of job there is no pressure to
get done.
Try a little at a time on sunny days when you are in the mood.
I have been resurrecting some plastic labels my friend Douglas Boatman
of Scotplants kept on the shrubs he supplied years ago.
The trouble is that some tend to become brittle and drop off.
Nonetheless, it's worth persevering with them because I think it is nice
to know exactly what the shrubs are.

ALTHOUGH pampas grass is very elegant to have in a garden, it is also
a bit of wanderer. Particularly at this time of year, with its long
plumes.
Its Sunday name is Cortaderia, and there are one or two different
varieties, including Argentea or a dwarf form called Pumila. There is
even a rose-coloured form called Rendatleri.
When I said that the grass is a wanderer, it is because birds tend to
carry the seed around the garden, which, in turn, tends to bring up
shoots in all sorts of odd places.
And once pampas grass gets a grip, it is very difficult to remove.
It can be drastically reduced, however, by burning at any time the
weather is dry in summer, and provided there are not plants around which
will be damaged by the flames.
Pampas grass looks best in a prime position, where it can be a focal
point.
Don't make the mistake of thinking it will be a diminutive specimen.
It will grow and grow. But you will have fun watching the birds swinging
on the plumes as they feed.

HOUSE-HUNTERS seeking a city centre home in Aberdeen can now choose
from three Stewart Milne Homes developments.
Following the launch of Belmont Mews (near Ashgrove Road) late last
year, the company has just released the first flats for sale at two new
sites in the city centre which offer a range of mainly one and two
bedroom luxury apartments.
At Balmoral Mews in Holburn Street, there is a choice of 12
two-bedroom flats in a variety of sizes and a one-off one-bedroom flat.
All are constructed to a high specification with fully fitted kitchens
including all white goods, gas central heating, double glazing and
fitted wardrobes to bedrooms. Many have the additional feature of bay
windows.
Prices start from #56,750
The development at Crathie Gardens consists of the flats at the corner
of Riverside Terrace and Crathie Gardens West. Internal features include
split-level lounge and dining areas, and bay windows in the main rooms.
Other features include en-suite facilities, allocated parking spaces
and landscaped gardens. As with Balmoral Mews, the first flats will be
ready for occupation in the summer.
''Both of these developments will appeal particularly to the elderly
and to the young professionals looking for a new home that's
conveniently close to the town centre,'' says divisional manager Donald
McInnes.

A VICTORIAN warehouse in Aberdeen is soon to provide 35 starter flats
for those who enjoy the pleasures of city life. Trinity House is a
substantial granite building overlooking the busy harbour and just round
the corner from Union Street.
Richard Campbell of Bon Accord Homes, the company undertaking the
conversion, is certain that the flats will sell well, particularly to
young professionals. Other developments the company have done in recent
years in the city centre -- in Ship Row, Market Street and the
Castlegate -- have proved popular with first-time buyers.
The area around Aberdeen harbour has recently been sahking off its
rather seedy, down-at-heel image, and refurbishment is bursting out all
over. Stewart Milne and Barratt also have projects in the area and the
city council is planning environmental improvements to The Green,
Aberdeen's historic market place.
The harbour area has a steadily growing population of young
professionals, and Richard Campbell has noticed that it is particularly
popular with single people, although he does expect interest from young
couples, too.
The new housing is not a replacement for the traditional commerce of
the area. Residents will be sharing Trinity House with Robert Duthie &amp;
Sons, wholesale grocers who have been trading out of Trinity Quay for 29
years. They will continue to occupy the basement, ground and first
floors.
The 35 flats at Trinity House are spread over the upper three floors
of the B-listed building, and are all one-bedroom, with lounge, kitchen,
and shower-room or bathroom.
Prices start from #39,500 and they are expected to be ready for May of
this year. Further information from Bon Accord Homes on 0224 644661.

IF YOU are looking for a bit of instant colour in the garden, plump
for primroses or Universal pansies
Primroses are available just now, and in the main they are remarkably
hardy. They are grown on under cool conditions in a greenhouse, so they
should not suffer a shock if put out of doors. The same is true of the
pansies.
I note that those in beds out of doors have precious few flowers on.
Those you buy should have some more colour, and this should be
sustained.
A bit of snow won't do primroses or pansies much harm. It acts as a
protective cover, which is why so many flowers flourish in the Alpine
slopes when the snow goes away.
It is the constant freezing and thawing which upsets plants, more than
anything It would take an abnormally cold spell to kill off hardy
primroses, or pansies.
Even if you don't want to run to the expense of planting up a whole
bed, give a thought to a window box or container.
In the next few weeks, you may find a blink of sun to sit out of
doors. It is nice to enjoy a bit of colour when you do so.

GLASGOW'S Botanic Gardens are special to many people, but as a former
gardener there after finishing college I am more sentimentally attached
to the place than most.
At the main gate of the gardens there is an excellent group of
conifers, opposite a large bed of rhododendrons which will be a blaze of
colour in a few months time.
But the real interest for the winter visitor is the Kibble Palace, the
botanic's hothouse complex.
The plants inside are planted in divisions which match the various
regions of the world. In the middle are tree ferns and the perimeter is
edged with beautifully decorative flax. Camellias are already starting
to flower. They provide a splendid show, both outside and under glass.
In the temperate section, the exotic rahaphiolepis indica is flowering
beautifully. It is well-worth having a look in the tropicarium, which
contains plants typical of rain forests.
In the other greenhouses, you can see more colour. In the first house
is a marvellous display of hyacinths, cineraria, cyclamen, and primula
obconica.
There are magnificent orchids in the conservatory, especially the
cymbidiums. The colours are breathtaking. Just coming into flower is
abutilon Golden Fleece.
Passing through to the cacti section, you go through the economic
house with a range of plants used for commercial purposes, all fully
described on labels.
Also in this section, is a range of insectivorous plants. They include
the sundew, found in boggy parts of Scotland, and pitcher plants which
trap insects for food in a sump full of digestive juices. The Venus
fly-trap plants are too small to be fully functional yet and this time
of year there are few flies about.
The cacti section has a charm of its own. You either like cacti, or
you don't. This section is well landscaped, so you could imagine you
were in tropical lands.
In the tropical palm house, you step into a jungle. You could imagine
Tarzan swinging from the trees. Centrepiece is the ''Powder Puff Tree'',
calliandra inaequilatera -- a real beauty not to be missed.
Next is the tropical fernhouse. Ferns love the warm, shady, humid
atmosphere. Lots of gardeners don't have success at home, because the
atmosphere is too dry. Some ferns do well in the bathroom.
Then there is the begonia house, with one of the best collections in
the country which even now offers a splash of summer.
Although grown in warmth, many begonias are superb at home,
particularly begonia rex with its variegated leaves.
Finally, there is the tropical flower house, with lots more colour.
There are even common plants such as begonia semperflorens and
euphorbias, which you may not recognise as they are so different from
the plants we miscall poinsettias.
There is a nice batch of coleus, which are well-known. They are the
named varieties, propagated from cuttings. There is a pool for goldfish
and an excellent batch of anthuriums. Some are very striking, not only
because of their flowers but their corrugated leaves.
It's quite a tonic on a dull winter day. As I emerged into the cold, I
was tempted to go to the nearest travel agent and book a holiday in the
tropics.
