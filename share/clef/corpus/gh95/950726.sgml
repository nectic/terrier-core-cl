THIS story began as a poem. Had it not been a poem, there would be no
story. Three weeks ago, Ivy Chapple of Ibrox penned a poem and sent it
to the editor of The Herald for publication on the letters page. She was
complaining about the unfairness of the predicament in which she's
recently found herself. Not that it's the first unjust situation of her
life; and nor was it her first poem. Indeed, that particular poem --
about her current status as an unemployed person -- is only a fraction
of her story.
Ivy Chapple was born and brought up in Liverpool, where she studied to
be a teacher. When she was 20, and still at college, she fell in love
with Keith -- a boy she met at Pontin's Holiday Camp in Weymouth. Within
six months of their first meeting, and two days after his 21st birthday,
he was murdered as he carried out his duties as a rent collector in
London.
As if that wasn't enough for Chapple to cope with, she subsequently
discovered that she was expecting his child: she had been only three
weeks pregnant when he was killed. As she relates this horrific
experience 23 years later, she suddenly remembers that she wrote a poem
about Keith's death, shortly after it happened. ''I think in really dark
times I turn to poetry,'' she says.
She had returned home to her parents when she found out that she was
pregnant. Her boyfriend's killer was sentenced to four years in prison.
Because of the trauma she was going through, her doctor offered her an
abortion and adoption was briefly considered. But Chapple determined to
have her child. Marianne was born in 1971, and has always known the
circumstances in which her mother carried her.
She was given her mother's maiden name, Chapple, and was later adopted
by her mother's first husband when they married four years after her
birth.
Her boyfriend's death also had a profound effect on Chapple's
religious life. Despite a strong Methodist upbringing, she ''turned away
from God'' and didn't go back to religion until 1982, by which time her
husband's work had taken them from Liverpool to Edinburgh.
''I made a phenomenal decision -- to give my life over to God. I
realised that I'd never faced up to the loss of Keith -- I'd only really
faced the practicalities. Eventually I came to the point where I was
wondering what life was all about. I had spent years mocking God and
then I went to a friend's child's christening and I said: 'If you're
there, God, give me a sign'.''
And six months later, Chapple says, He did. ''I was sitting in my
house and I felt a presence like two hands on my shoulder. Then a voice
in my head said: 'The Bible', and this presence -- I know now it was the
Holy Spirit -- led me to the Bible (I still had one). I didn't know what
to do next so I went to see the local minister and when I told him what
had happened, he said: 'Hallelujah -- we've prayed for this'.''
Chapple decided to follow through what had happened to her. She
feared, however, that her husband -- as agnostic as she herself had been
since her boyfriend's death -- would not accept her decision. And he
didn't. They drifted apart, then separated -- amicably -- and divorced
four years later, in 1988.
Then three years ago, Chapple decided that she'd like to meet a new
man. ''I'd been on my own for nearly 10 years and I did feel lonely
sometimes, though you can be just as lonely when you're married. But I
decided that it would be nice to meet someone, and someone Christian.''
The problem was that any nice men who came along to church meetings were
instantly snapped up. So, ever practical, Chapple informed God: ''I'm
going to join a dating agency''.
Shortly after that, she came across an ad for a ''Christian dating
agency'', New Day Introductions. After a great deal of hysterics she
filled in the form. ''You had to send in a profile of yourself and a
profile of the person you'd like to meet. Mine had to be tall; have his
own teeth and his own hair. He also had to be tolerant, kind, easygoing
and have a sense of humour.'' She met two men who fitted the
description, but it was a case of third time lucky in terms of really
hitting it off.
Chapple's blind date with the Gourock-based Colin was arranged for 2pm
one afternoon in Glasgow's Queen Street Station. More than once,
incontrollable fits of the giggles meant that she had to slope off to
the ladies', but Colin was completely blase.
With characteristic irony, Chapple describes their first encounter, as
''wonderfully romantic'': ''We went for a coffee and then we weren't
sure what to do next. So we went to look at wall lights because I was
doing up my kitchen.'' Colin -- who was divorced with three children --
and Chapple became great friends and gradually realised that they loved
each other.
They married in Leith on May 13. Chapple, who had been applying for
employment outwith teaching, was ''quite happy'' to give up her
Edinburgh job, and since Colin enjoyed his work as a business adviser
they decided to live in Glasgow. After their honeymoon in Paris, Chapple
signed on for the first time. Her poem, the one which she sent to The
Herald, describes the experience:
. . . THEY said,
'You can't have
unemployment benefit
because you gave up your job for no good reason'.
I thought (naively) falling in love and
moving to be with someone you love
was a good reason.
But it wasn't.
Then I thought
'I've paid my stamp for
23 years.
I've paid my social security'.
But THEY said 'Tough!
Too bad!
You don't deserve it'!
What prompted Chapple's poem was not her own income-less predicament,
which she hopes an appeal will rectify, but an observation she made on
her visit to the DSS the day before she sat down to write it.
I signed on again yesterday,
it was the third or fourth time,
I'm not sure,
And the man didn't smile or say hello.
He just looked and grunted.
Then I noticed,
I never noticed this the other weeks,
that he ran this pen thing across a bar code.
I looked behind me and saw
all the other 'dolies' all
queuing neatly
And I felt like we were packages
at the supermarket
check out
all lined up to be
bar coded off
and put into a basket
I thought being 'just a number'
was bad enough.
But to simply be a bar code
that gets passed through the check out
and put in a basket
Well it made me feel strange
not human just a product
to be put into a basket.
The poem ended up in The Herald's mailbag because, Chapple says: ''I
felt that people should be aware of the injustice, because if it's
happening to me, then it can happen to others. I've realised in two
months how disabling unemployment is -- and I've got a lot behind me. So
I can't imagine what a 17-year-old with no experience must feel. The
least the people at the DSS could do is be cheerful and nice to us, then
at least we would feel like real people. I'm surprised at how
demoralised this has made me feel''.

THE Eurovision song contest is not so much a song competition as a way
of life -- a yearly ritual as unmissable as the Oscar night in some
quarters.
After Tim Luscombe's Eurovision a year or so back (slaughtered when it
ventured into the West End though it did very nicely thank you off-West
End at the Drill Hall), you wouldn't have thought there was much room
for another gay play extolling the virtues of all those ''nil points''.
Yet along comes Jonathan Harvey, whose urban fairy story, Beautiful
Thing, stopped just this side of soap opera to show us there's still
some mileage to be run and giving us a much-needed feel-good factor into
the bargain.
Lee is celebrating this year's contest by inviting round to his
Kentish Town flat a bunch of sometimes camp, woefully incompatible
friends. There's Steph, a vicious queen, Nick, a TV actor, and his wife
Tanya, who never stop fighting, Wendy, Lee's sister, upstairs Norman,
and droopy E-head loser, Roy.
In the course of the evening, the television blows, Tanya and Wendy
are discovered by Roy in a searing lesbian clinch, Steph needles
everybody and absconds with Norman into the bedroom for a spot of
jocular S &amp; M and Lee only partially manages to cope with a tradition
made all the more difficult by it being the first since the death of his
boyfriend Michael.
Edgily perceptive and often very funny, Harvey shows yet again that he
is second to none in reflecting certain urban lifestyles in a way that
appeals to audiences of all persuasions -- even when, as here, the
acting is below par. I'd give it seven.

IT'S hardly surprising that the heady moment when dour British
austerity cracked and gave way under the wonder of American materialism
and (the Big One) the birth of rock'n'roll, is a place that succeeding
generations never seem tired of revisiting. Jez Butterworth's Mojo --
this year's George Devine Award-winner -- can't resist it either.
In Ian Rickson's testosterone-drenched, brilliantly directed Satanic
comedy, it is the gangland lads of 1950s Soho running the juke boxes and
controlling the new, hip-swivelling discoveries that are the subject of
his scrutiny.
These swaggering conmen and low-life hucksters -- Sweets, Skinny,
Babe, Potts, and Mickey -- are, in truth, a vile lot; they'd stitch
their mothers up soon as look at them (though the female of the species
is hardly the point here and only useful as a term of abuse). Babe's Dad
gets consigned to two dustbins during the course of the evening and
Skinny doesn't make it to the end either.
But with something of the same criminal glitter of Simon Donald's Life
of Stuff, Mojo is really more celebration than revulsion. Butterworth's
dialogue crackles with a dangerously alluring wit, while Rickson's
dynamic production gives Andy Serkis, Matt Bardock, and Aiden Gillen's
strutting, pill-popping villains and even Tom Hollander's cool, whining
psychopathic unquestionable appeal.
Like Sam Shepard and a host of writers since -- and Patrick Marber's
current West End success, Dealer's Choice, is the most recent example --
Butterworth has found an audience-loving, theatrical metaphor for
exploring male top-doggery that, like The Godfather, can't help but
glamourise even while it reviles.

THE release of greenfield housing sites in Strathclyde has fallen
''abysmally'' behind target, according to building industry
representatives.
Under the 1990 Structure Plan approved by the Secretary of State for
Scotland in 1992, the region was supposed to provide sites for some
6,350 new houses by the spring of 1997. Only some 680 had been built by
the end of March this year.
''With only two years left of the original target period, even the
Regional Council's drastically reduced programme of 2600 has no chance
of being met,'' says Alistair Landells, of the Scottish House-builders
Association. The SHBA has carried out a survey into the lack of progress
on around 30 greenfield housing locations contained in the 1990
Structure Plan.
Shortage of residential sites has pushed up land prices as volume
builders compete with each other for any site that becomes to the
market.
The SHBA Review concludes that many of the sites earmarked for housing
are clearly unsuitable, illustrated by the recent refusal of planning
consent for one of the sites on the western edge of Hamilton. This
location, which was intended to supply some 700 houses by 1997, has been
dogged by a series of problems.
A link road between the East Kilbride Expressway and Earnock Road was
shelved and SHBA expressed doubts at the alternative of having to make
access through an industrial estate.
''The Lanarkshire Development Agency which owns the site has now quite
properly indicated it wants a period of three years without any
residential expansion, which knocks any possible output from this site
back to 1998 at the earliest,'' says Alistair Landells.
It is ''unbelievable'' that when the district council was preparing
its detailed master plan in 1994 it discovered a new primary school was
needed, yet Strathclyde Region failed to identify this as an issue when
producing the Structure Plan. ''The Western Hamilton fiasco does little
for the credibility of the planning system and only highlights the lack
of appreciation of timescales by planning authorities.
The situation is by no means confined to Hamilton, with none of the
three greenfield locations in Strathkelvin District due to produce
anything before 1997.''
The association will be lodging its objections to the 1994 Strathclyde
Structure Plan, which is due to be sent to the Secretary of State for
Scotland.
''We will certainly be making strenuous protests about the excessive
delays in bringing forward these greenfield locations which are needed
to meet current housing demands,'' says Alistair Landells.

TIMESHARE has had a bad press for many years as an industry with more
than its share of dubious-deal wide boys.
A great pity, because the basic concept is a good one, and there are
many reputable companies involved in the industry. The weak point,
however, is when owners try to sell their time and find it well-nigh
impossible, and they almost have to give them away.
For the uninitiated the timeshare purchaser buys a week or weeks at a
certain period in the year - which is divided into low, middle and high
season. From then on, either in perpetuity (which is a legal possibility
in Scotland), or for a specified period, 25 or 50 years for example,
these weeks are yours, or can be willed to your heirs.
You, your family or friends can use the time, or you may decide to let
the weeks. If you have membership of an exchange organisation, such as
RCI, you can swap your own time for a similar period at another resort.
It adds up to inflation-proof holidays, leaving owners only having to
book and pay for their flights. Of course, you will also have to pay an
annual maintenance charge for each week, which covers management costs,
cleaning, maintenance of property, gardens.
August 31 will see Scotland's first public timeshare auction at
Edinburgh's Royal Scot Hotel. Up to 200 lots will be offered for sale by
the organisers, Trinity Factors, a well-known Edinburgh firm of estate
agents and factors.
All the properties offered will be in Scottish resorts such as Cameron
House on Loch Lomond, Craigendarroch on Royal Deeside, Coylumbridge,
Kilconquhar in Fife, and Dunkeld Highland Lodges, with prices expected
to range from #1000-#15,000.
''Most Scottish resorts offer their property in perpetuity, which
means quite literally, holidays for ever,'' says Alasdair Seale,
managing director of Trinity Factors. ''Already, we have an encouraging
number of lots for the auction including some prime 'red' weeks, which
are readily exchangeable for timeshares throughout the world.''
Ed Henry, Trinity's estate agency manager and chartered surveyor,
says: ''Public auctions for timeshare have been done pretty successfully
in England, and achieved reasonable prices. The last such auction sold
about a quarter of the lots, which was considered very successful. If we
have anywhere near that, we'll be well on-target and very happy.''
Second-hand timeshare is the smart way to buy property, when the heavy
marketing costs of the developer have been shed, and prices are usually
much lower. Normally, only when a developer has completed a resort and
there is demand for the weeks, can individuals get back the kind of
price they have paid as first buyers.
Henry says that the 14-day cooling-off period will be observed, and
developers have been invited to make presentations on their resorts
before the auction.
''When we start to compile all the lots, we'll talk not only to owners
but also to resorts to get an up-to-date appraisal of how they are
selling, and prices weeks are selling. At the end of the day, we are
here to provide a service for clients who own the weeks we are
auctioning.''
Diana Hanks, consumer services manager of the Timeshare Council, the
industry's watchdog, says there has been much less adverse publicity
over timeshare in the last three years.
''We have lobbied for a European Directive which was achieved in
October 1994, and will be effective in member states by April 1997 at
the latest,'' she explained. It will provide a ten-day cooling-off
period, which should solve the remaining problem.
''We've dealt with the problem of mail-shotting - that's long over,
we've got the Timeshare Act 1992 in the UK which provides for a 14-day
cooling-off period, and there is the same jurisdiction in Portugal and
Maderia.
''The legislation in mainland Spain, the Canaries and the Balearic
Islands however, isn't in force yet, so this year's holidaymakers should
be aware of this - there's no cooling-off period at present.''
A major problem for the industry has been a number of retail companies
setting up, taking fees from people wanting to sell weeks, and then
closing shop - taking with them customers' money for which they have had
no services.
Intending purchasers and sellers of timeshare can send an s.a.e. to
the Timeshare Council, 23 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6LB, for a free
information pack.

THE prestige of the J&amp;B Scottish Amateur Golf Championship received a
considerable setback yesterday when the country's two leading players,
Gordon Sherry and Stephen Gallacher, scratched.
Their sense of priority, loyalty even, is questionable. Clearly the
sponsors and the Scottish Golf Union will be unhappy at the absence of
two players for whom the championship has held an important place in the
development of their splendid careers. Gallacher won the title in 1992
and Sherry was a semi-finalist last year.
Two of the four Scots so far selected for Britain and Ireland's Walker
Cup side, they were seeded to meet in the final of the championship,
which begins on Monday at Southerness on the shores of the Solway Firth.
Both have had a hectic programme recently. In the last three weeks
Sherry, the Amateur champion, and Gallacher, the European individual
champion, have contributed vitally to Scotland's victory in the European
Team championship and played in both the Scottish Open at Carnoustie and
the Open Championship at St Andrews -- a schedule at which the most
iron-clad professional would blanche.
Sherry, moreover, has accepted an invitation to compete in the Royal
Canadian Golf Association's centenary amateur championship in Toronto
next month, when Gallacher is due to defend his European title at El
Prat, Barcelona. Soon after all this playing and travelling they will
have to turn their attention to preparing for the match against the
United States in September at Royal Porthcawl.
There have, of course, never been more opportunities for leading
amateurs, most of them full-time players, to learn their craft before,
as is invariably the case, they join the professional ranks. As a
consequence, the importance of pacing a season, of selecting events
carefully, has become almost as integral a part of their careers as that
of any professional.
The six remaining seeds still include the other two Scots selected for
the Walker Cup match -- Barclay Howard of Cochrane Castle and
Palacerigg's Graham Rankin -- and the holder, Hugh McKibbin of Troon
Welbeck, will begin the defence of the title he won at Renfrew on Monday
afternoon.

THE summer-long signing saga surrounding Rangers and Romanian Florin
Raducioiu finally came to an end yesterday. Ibrox manager Walter Smith,
who had spent days negotiating on the telephone from the team's Danish
headquarters, finally lost patience.
Twice previously Smith had been ready to fly out from Copenhagen to
finalise the #2.7m deal for Raducioiu. Twice the journeys were
cancelled, and Smith was left frustrated.
Yesterday it all came to a head when Smith announced: ''The deal for
Florin Raducioiu is off. We have been messed about enough. The player
will be remaining with Espanol.''
The transfer talks concerning the Romanian had been the most
complicated Smith has ever found himself involved in, especially as
Raducioiu was apparently being sold by Espanol without being consulted.
That was just one of the many complications which finally saw the
proposed deal flounder and die.
Smith would not elaborate on other probable targets, but it would be a
major surprise if he does not make moves soon into the European market.
The likelihood that the club will be playing in the European Champions'
League this season is a strong bargaining card for Rangers, but Smith
must move quickly as the signing deadline for the preliminary round is
August 1. However, for players to qualify to play in the Champions'
League itself, then August 15 is the cut-off point.
Meanwhile, Smith has sent one of the Ibrox backroom staff, Ewan
Chester, to Germany in an attempt to track down their European Cup
opponents, Anorthosis of Famagusta. The Cypriots have been refusing to
provide Rangers with information on their playing plans prior to the
first leg match at Ibrox. However, Smith found out that they were
organising warm-up games in Germany.
Smith said: ''Ewan Chester is in Hamburg and will be able to take a
look at them. After that either Archie Knox or myself will also go to
see them. We also have a video from a Danish club who played them
recently.''
Meanwhile, for Rangers' final match of the Danish tour, against
Hvidovre in Copenhagen, Richard Gough, Alan McLaren and perhaps even
Paul Gascoigne will make appearances. The other new signing, Stephen
Wright, who has played in all the pre-season matches so far, will be
rested.
''The first game against Brondby was always going to be the biggest
test for us over here and I thought we handled that one well,'' said
Smith. ''The others allow us the opportunity to give all the players a
run.
''I don't want to overplay Stephen Wright and Paul Gascoigne, because
I think it's important to have them looking at their best for our own
tournament. Gascoigne will possibly play for half the game in
Copenhagen, certainly no more than that. I expect Gough and McLaren to
be ready to play as well.''
While Rangers have been preparing in Denmark veteran striker Ally
McCoist has been training at home after collecting a gash on a knee
against St Mirren in a closed-doors match.
Smith said: ''The doctor will look at him when we return on Thursday
and, hopefully, he can have the stitches taken out and come back into
contention for the tournament.''

DUNDEE United plunged into debt yesterday when they paid #1m for
Coventry City pair Steven Pressley and Sandy Robertson, and last night
Tannadice chairman Jim McLean admitted: ''We are taking a huge gamble
and facing a financial disaster if we don't get people out the door
while we are trying to get back to the premier division in one season.''
Manager Billy Kirkwood, who is with the squad on a pre-season trip to
Finland, brought his summer signings up to five with the record #750,000
capture of Scotland under 21-star Pressley and Robertson for #250,000.
McLean revealed that United had taken on an overdraft to finance the
spending spree and would not discuss specific players who might go in
order to help balance the books, even though Celtic target Gordan Petric
and Brian Welsh are being tipped to move.
The United chairman said: ''The board made the decision to go into
debt and try to improve matters at this club, because the fans did not
desert us last season when they could so easily have turned their backs
on us.''
McLean added: ''Our wage bill is crippling and it is urgent that
people leave.''
He wants to swell the overdraft with one further signing before the
season starts and said: ''We are still looking for a quality striker,
but we can make no promises on that. We have talked to people about
getting one, but they say 'No chance', simply because they are so
scarce.''
McLean is also aware that the two latest signings are former Rangers
players who worked under Kirkwood when he was reserve coach at Ibrox.
He said: ''I know questions will be asked about so many former Rangers
coming here, but my answer is that Billy is better to go for players he
knows. I believe that should always apply to any manager.''
In fact, both Pressley and Robertson admitted that their knowledge of
Kirkwood had helped to tempt them from the English Premiership to the
Scottish first division.
Pressley is aware of his poor disciplinary record in England and the
fact that suspensions played a key part of United's problems at the end
of last season.
He said: ''I struggled early on with the different style down there,
but I wasn't booked in my last five or six games. I think I can handle
that side of the game and I believe I am coming back a better player,
because I learned a lot in England.''
Robertson was also influenced by Kirkwood's presence at Tannadice, but
he said: ''It was time for me to come back to Scotland, because it is
time I played first team football.
''Coventry wanted to put me in the reserves as captain, but I was
doing that with Rangers when I was 17.''

JAMES Thompson, the Vauxhall team-mate of British Touring Car
Championship leader John Cleland, was taken to hospital after crashing
at 125mph in yesterday's test session for Sunday's two races at
Knockhill.
The 21-year-old Yorkshireman, who had to be cut free from his wrecked
Cavalier, is believed to have suffered severe bruising but no broken
bones.
He has been detained in Queen Margaret's Hospital, Dunfermline, for
observation.
Thompson's car left the circuit at the notorious Duffus Dip corner,
the fastest point on the circuit at the end of the main straight.

CELTIC suffered yet another humiliating setback last night to their
plans for a successful new season with this defeat by Wilhelmshaven.
The Scots' opponents were a part-time amateur side from the German
third division, precisely the same status as Kickers Emden, who beat
Celtic 2-0 at the weekend.
The Germans made their superior pace and fitness tell throughout the
match and could have won more emphatically.
Now Tommy Burns must hope he can give the team and the Parkhead fans a
major boost by quickly concluding the #2m transfer of Bayer Leverkusen
striker Andreas Thom.
If the deal for the German international goes through it will be a
relief to Celtic supporters who have seen the Scottish Cup holders
suffer at the hands of lowly opponents on their tour.
Manager Tommy Burns said: ''We won't be judged on what happens here. I
deliberately mixed the team up to try out different options and give
certain players a game. They will be ready and fully motivated when the
real competition starts.
''However, there are a lot of things which need to be fixed. We still
have to settle on our best formation, but I agree we must raise our game
considerably tomorrow night against St Pauli in Hamburg.
''I would not rule out Thom making his debut there as talks with the
player and our club have been ongoing all day.''
How Celtic could have used a player of such creativity against
Wilhelmshaven. The Glasgow side were in trouble as early as the eighth
minute when, after several threatening attacks had dismantled Celtic's
defence without too much difficulty, the Germans took the lead. Left
winger Jacek Janiak, who was a constant problem, delivered a penetrating
cross for Jens Pfahl to volley in from 20 yards.
Stuart Gray and Malky Mackay both missed clear-cut chances to equalise
and eventually those scorned opportunities proved so costly.
In 58 minutes the Germans went further ahead after Celtic's
shortcomings in defence were again exposed. Stefan Lang hit the bar then
Pfahl's attempt from the rebound was blocked, but still Celtic were
unable to clear. Janiak scored easily at the back post.
Only when Brian McLaughlin and Andy Walker took over from Gray and
Simon Donnelly did Celtic come to life. Walker in particular looked
sharp around the box and he pulled a goal back when a McLaughlin corner
was turned on by Mackay and he scored from close range.
But it was all too little too late.
CELTIC -- Marshall, Vata, McKinlay, McNally, Mackay, Grant, Donnelly,
Gray, van Hooydonk, Falconer, Collins. Substitutes -- Martin, Bonner,
Mowbray, Walker, McLaughlin.

IT would be difficult to imagine a play more singularly suited to The
Arches Theatre Company's talent for arch (sic) but endearing
overstatement than Joseph Kesselring's magnificent black comedy. The
tale of Mortimer Brewster's attempts to keep the lid, especially that of
the window seat, on his sweet old aunties' murderous exploits -- 12
bodies in the cellar and counting -- has farce in spadefuls, hyperbolic
characterisation, and lines so caustic they make your freckles burn.
Directed by Andy Arnold, the casting is quite inspired, from the
debonair freneticism of Vincent Friell as Mortimer, the pert glamour of
Tricia Reid as his fiancee Elaine, the bombast of Paul Riley as the
deranged Teddy Brewster, the insinuating mincery of Callum Cuthbertson
as Dr Einstein, to the awesome menace of Derek McLuckie as the Boris
Karloff lookalike Jonathan Brewster.
Even William Leslie's brief cameos as a vagrant and police lieutenant
are more than arresting, and at the core of it all, exuding quiet but
mischievous self-possession, are Morag Stark and a masterly Jill
Riddiford as the aunts. However, while it's daunting to have cavils
about a play which so bitingly skewers the art of the reviewer via
running gags abour Mortimer's profession, I had serious misgivings.
While the individual parts are wickedly funny, the cast utterly failed
to cohese. There are too many sticky moments and not enough gelling
together.
Much of Kessilring's humour is derived from physical gags which
require split-second timing but the pace is too sluggish in the first
half and simply awry in the second. Perhaps the company will soon turn
the giggles they do generate into the raucous hilarity they are clearly
capable of.

SOUTH West Water is acting quickly to implement the Greenbury Report's
recommendations on directors' remuneration by taking steps to reduce
drastically the length of its service contracts for directors, writes
CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Chairman Keith Court told the annual meeting that service contracts
are to be reduced from three years to two immediately and the second
year will reduce month by month over the next 12 months until by next
July contracts will be one year only.
In addition no new share options will be granted and a new long-term
incentive scheme will be put to shareholders at the next annual meeting.
Mr Court said the group would implement those parts of the Greenbury
Report which it did not already practice. It already complies with the
code of best practice put forward by the Cadbury Committee.
It has established a policy of company ethics to govern the conduct of
the group's dealings with third parties.
Greenbury recommended that service contracts be reduced to one year or
even less, though any reduction this would require should be spread over
a period. It also said that the reasons for contracts of longer duration
should be explained fully to shareholders.

IF spectators had been allowed to vote on who might contest the
play-off in Sunday's thrilling finale at St Andrews one doubts if the
chosen pairing would have been Costantino Rocca and John Daly. More
likely it would have been Sandy Lyle v Nick Faldo or Colin Montgomerie
against David Feherty, because they would have been perceived as grudge
matches.
There is nothing that the great sporting public loves better than an
encounter with a bit of genuine hostility added.
I do not know whether Lyle and Faldo are still the best of enemies.
Indeed, it is often a little difficult to detect a few folk who might be
described as Nick's friends.
What I do know is that many people still recall the time Faldo
reported Lyle for a minor infraction of the rules. They were barely
adults at the time, but the memory lingers on.
Mix in the Scotland v England factor, a St Andrews crowd and I don't
think there would be much banter as they came down the fairway . . . nor
too many big hugs at the finish.
Feherty, the anorexic-looking Ulsterman, may or may not have
proclaimed that Montgomerie had a face like a wart-hog which had just
been stung by a wasp. He definitely made some similar sort of jest.
Big Monty can be good company and has a wry sense of humour himself.
He would be less than human, however, if he was not possessed of the
desire to put the sting on Feherty where it hurts most.
When Damon Hill shunted into the back of Michael Schumacher in the
British Grand Prix it was the latest act in their fiercely-fought battle
to be the No.1 driver. Schumacher did the same to his rival in Adelaide
last year, thus depriving Hill of the championship, and it looks as
though their dodgem days are to continue.
A little warning by the authorities to both -- what had Schumacher
done on this occasion? -- will hardly be enough to stop it. Motor racing
has worked out that the grudge is great for bringing publicity to the
sport.
Boxer Nigel Benn said at the weekend he was fed up knocking over
no-talent bums, an activity of which F Bruno Esq never tires, but he
knows the biggest pay-day of his life can come round by staging fight
No.3 with Chris Eubank. When it does, look out for fists flying among
the fans, too.
The Wimbledon act appears to have been cleaned up since spoilt brats
McEnroe and Connors quit breaking strings. Hasn't it become boring as
well? The nobody who walked off after insulting the umpire is unlikely
to become a household name, while Agassi will have to do more than dress
up like a scullery maid. He needs to find somebody to dislike.
Linford Christie has never had that problem. He hates, at any given
time, at least 90% of the media corps and any American who dares to
cross the line ahead of him. Linford has more chips than Harry Ramsden,
yet he is still the biggest draw in British athletics.
Without doubt Carl Lewis couldn't stand Ben Johnson -- with good
reason as it turned out -- and Mary Decker never did forgive Zola Budd.
Back in the days when Scotland had a world class sprint relay team
there was no love lost among two if its members -- indeed, they were
extremely reluctant to hand the baton over one to the other.
I still cherish the observation of Mrs Margot Wells, wife of Allan,
regarding his team-mate Drew McMaster. ''He runs well for a midget,''
she opined.
Dear old Eric Brown, much missed on the golf circuit, had rip-roaring
encounters with American Tommy Bolt on Ryder Cup business.
''Well, I didn't enjoy that,'' declared Bolt at the conclusion of one
of their duels.
''I'm not surprised,'' retorted Brown, ''you played a lot of
rubbish.''
Did Eric ever say rubbish?
My own boyhood hero was the finest No.7 this country has ever produced
-- bar none -- Gordon Smith of the Hibernians. I would watch him, and
the other members of the Famous Five, weave their magic from a regular
spot on the Easter Road terraces.
Yet, it has to be admitted, there was a left back against whom Gordon
never fared well. Big Tam McKenzie of the Heart of Midlothian, never a
player who seriously interested the international selectors, was able to
put the hex on Smith like no other.
Just occasionally, to enforce his point, he would put Gordon over the
wall into the enclosure. Neither man ever attacked the other publicly,
they were not seen taking tea afterwards either.
We all like the odd grudge and sounding off about those whom we find
objectionable. As wee Jim McLean was saying just the other day . . . no,
sorry, we just don't have that much space.

GO to this for the music. Sit back and simply marvel at the
inspirational outpourings -- more hits in 18 months than other artists
chart in a lifetime -- of a goofy innocent from Lubbock, Texas.
Promo-men did all they could to make Buddy Holly look the Identikit of a
fifties teen idol. He stayed exactly as he was: a gawky guy with
glasses, and it's this inate down-home quality that Angus MacGregor
communicates so engagingly in a central performance one is happy to
believe in.
And that, of course, is the point of the show. We all know Bubby died.
Some of us even know the date: February 3, 1959. But from time to time
we hanker after something more than replaying the singles, albums, and
compilation tributes in the corner. We want to breathe in a live
performance. See the guy with that cute little hiccup in his voice, that
reedy nasal voice that harboured all the shy, hopeful romanticism of a
teenager on a first date. And though I suspect Angus MacGregor endows
Holly with a tad more rock'n'roll swagger than he actually had -- real
snazzy duck-walks abound -- he none the less stays faithful to our
memories, allows us to indulge fond fantasies with honour.
Sadly the bits in between the songs are disappointing. Sketchy,
perfunctory, jokey even -- so that you start to question the
authenticity of things you know you know. The culture shock that was
rock'n'roll -- Middle America rightly identified it as subversive,
probably commy red as well as deeply black -- is given a token mention
in the passing.

<HEADLINE>Mitie targets Scotland as profits rise 36% to #4.57m</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND is becoming an increasingly more important market for Mitie
Group as a greater number of hospitals than expected has turned to it
for contract cleaning services.
There was a delayed start but business is moving ahead faster than
anywhere else in Britain and chairman David Telling is hoping that more
hospitals follow suit south of the Border.
In the year to March, pre-tax profits rose 36% to #4.57m on turnover
20% higher at #125m. That includes #10m of loss-making work brought in
through the acquisition of Securicor Cleaning.
Mitie is unusual in that it encourages entrepreurially-minded people
to start businesses in return for deferred long-term equity and so each
year there are usually one or two loss-makers in the initial stages.
Altogether there are 44 subsidiaries, the head office has only 12
people. The new painting company recently set up in Inverness is just
one example.
In a somewhat unusual analogy, Mitie likens itself to the Boer
fighters in the South African War in the late 1890s. They were able to
make very quick decisions unlike the highly stratified British Army of
the time.
It is not too concerned about the prospect of a minimum wage of #4.15
per hour because there are renegotiation clauses in most contracts while
ever tighter legislation should help maintain the demand for services.
There has been a good improvement in forward orders in the mechanical
and engineering contracting activities.
The group has concentrated on the refurbishment market in contracting
and so be much closer to the customer.
Margins last year improved from 3.1% to 3.7% and should sail through
4% this time round without any trouble on likely turnover of about
#150m. That points to profits of about #6.5m to leave the shares, now at
a high of 238p, trading at under 15 times likely earnings and about 11
times those for the following year.
Mr Telling reckons a Labour regime would be beneficial to the company
because of the likelihood of increased building activity.
The dividend total has been raised 33% to 3p for a 1.6% yield from a
share which still offers substantial potential.

EDINBURGH'S Lisa McKenna is planning to join forces with the
London-based sisters, Senga and Helen Macfie, as the Scottish contingent
on the women's world squash circuit.
The 17-year-old has already applied to join the Women's International
Squash Players' Association, and will make her debut within the next
couple of months.
It was her success in the recent Junior World championships in
Australia -- she reached the last 16 of the individual event and led
Scotland to an equal best fifth place in the team championship -- that
convinced Lisa she needs to set her sights higher.
''All the other leading juniors have world rankings and I realised
that I am not that far away,'' said Lisa. ''One of my best victories was
over Pamela Pancis, who is ranked in the top 60.
''But I do need more experience, and that will come from playing on
the world circuit. I'll have a look at the schedule, but I'll definitely
make my debut early in the new season.''
Her other main target is a first Scottish senior cap. ''I'll be
playing on the Scottish Grand Prix circuit, and hoping to claim one of
the places for next year's European championships.''
In a brave move Lisa, a former British under-16 champion who is
coached by Glasgow-based John Kirby, left school last summer to
concentrate on full-time squash. But she believes the decision will soon
be paying dividends.
''The women's game is fairly open and I am sure I can get into the
upper reaches of the world rankings,'' she said.
''I'm thoroughly enjoying my squash, and I'm really excited about the
new season.''
Her next major event will be the European Squash Club Championships in
Helsinki in September, when she will be aiming, along with Alison Bowie,
Desni Nixon and Louise Philip, to help Scottish Cup holders Edinburgh
Sports Club repeat their bronze medal success of 1992.

CORPORATE ventures in the motor industry are becoming more common, but
it is still quite surprising to see two companies which make no bones
about being rivals in the marketplace getting together to build a
vehicle neither of them is prepared to finance on its own. The latest
example of this is the MPV which Ford -- after several weeks of
publicity -- is about to get down to actually supplying. Ford will sell
it as the Galaxy, but the same vehicle will soon be on the market as a
Volkswagen.
Low wage rates and other advantages on the Iberian peninsula have
attracted several vehicle manufacturers there, but this Ford/Volkswagen
project is the first major exercise in Portugal. In fact, the AutoEuropa
factory at Palmela, south of Lisbon, represents the country's biggest
ever industrial investment, with not only Ford and VW but also the
government and the EU involved. The two car companies have split
responsibilities in an intriguing way.
Ford took the lead when it came to the production end of the business.
Running factories on a profitable basis is a Ford speciality, as it has
shown at Jaguar, and the company used its worldwide connections by
sending many of the Portuguese employees to train at a similar plant in
Mexico.
The Galaxy comes with the choice of a Ford two-litre engine, a
1.9-litre turbo diesel or the highly regarded Volkswagen 2.8-litre V6.
At the moment there are three trim levels named Aspen, after the
fashionable Colorado resort, GLX and Ghia. Later in the year there will
be a top-of-the-range Ultima specification which, as in the Scorpio,
will be loaded with special equipment, including air conditioning and
leather upholstery.
Other companies in the MPV business expect Ford to be the volume
seller, and are watching its prices keenly. They start at #15,995 for
the base model two-litre Aspen in five-seater configuration, go on via
#16,495 for the Aspen seven-seater and #16,995 for the first turbo
diesel, and peak at #21,500 for the Ghia. There is also a six-seater
layout; so, unlike some rival vehicles which have a take-it-or-leave-it
approach to seating, the Galaxy offers a mesmerising variety.
Ford arranged the introductory drive in Easter Ross and Sutherland,
areas without any of the motorways on which MPVs are bound to spend a
lot of time on holiday jaunts. However, the exercise showed that this
bulky-looking vehicle is at home even on narrow country lanes, and is
nowhere near as cumbersome to drive as you might suppose.
The Galaxy has a high-set, comfortable and commanding driving position
behind an imposing fascia, runs with a muted rumble from the tyres, is
unexpectedly agile on winding and undulating minor roads, and has a fine
supple ride from its softish all-in dependent suspension settings.
Obviously, the 174bhp V6 engine is the high performer, but the two-litre
went better than I had been expecting, although a heavily laden example
would struggle somewhat on the hills and for acceleration.
Unlike some of its rivals, the Galaxy does not feature a walk-through
interior. In certain models the front seats swivel round -- although
this is something to be practised in advance, to avoid jamming the
driver's seat against the steering wheel or the B-pillar. Folded down,
the middle-row seat backs incorporate picnic trays, making the Galaxy a
good ''event'' vehicle, and I could see it being used as a mobile
office.
The middle seats seem high-set to those used to travelling in the rear
seats of a conventional car, and there is the familiar problem that you
can transport five, six or seven people, although not, in-board, a
corresponding amount of luggage. But this is another MPV which proves
itself pleasant and comfortable on the road, with car-type noise levels
and ride quality. Ford marketing will ensure that, in the fullness of
time, the Galaxy is the one we will see in the greatest numbers.

EMPLOYERS must consult trade unions where they represent more than 10%
of their workforce and concede negotiating rights where a majority are
unionised, under proposals launched by the TUC.
A ''Representation Agency'', with union and employer involvement,
would be set up to enforce the new collective rights which could, in
extreme cases, result in recalcitrant employers being hauled before the
courts.
TUC proposals for rights to representation at work are spelt out in a
48-page report ''Your voice at work'' unveiled yesterday.
With Labour seen as increasingly likely to set up the next
administration the reaction of employment spokesperson Harriet Harman
was crucial.
She declared it unreasonable when employees want to be represented by
their union for employers to refuse. Labour would ''give people the
right to join a union and, where there is substantial proven support
among the workforce, the right for a union to be recognised by the
employer''.
TUC proposals centre on a new framework of legal rights to give all
employees:
* A right to representation at work, including union members by their
union;
* A right to be consulted by employers over major changes in their
company, including union members as a group where they make up more than
10% of the workforce;
* A right to choose a union to negotiate on their behalf, where there
is a majority of employees who want this.
The report will be the focus of a major debate at the September TUC
Congress.

CARPETRIGHT shares were propelled up 10p to 311p after a bullish
statement from chairman and chief executive Sir Philip Harris, writes
NICOLA REEVES.
Despite continued sluggish activity levels in the housing market,
Carpetright reported a sales increase of more than 30% in the first 12
weeks of the current financial year.
Traditionally carpet sales have been closely linked to house moves and
the general level of consumer spending.
Speaking at the company's annual meeting, Sir Philip said the board
considered the results to be satisfactory given the weak state of the
carpet and house market. Carpetright continues to gain market share.
In the current financial year, three new Carpetright stores have been
opened and are said to be trading successfully. This brings to 188 the
total number of outlets. Around 30 new shops are expected to open in the
current year.
Carpetright traditionally has been in the low-to-mid price bracket but
has successfully introduced a Premier range into seven designated
outlets within other retailers like MFI and Homebase as well as
department stores. All of these are said to be exceeding budget. It
intends to have 20 stores operating by the year-end.
However, this is a low-risk expansion given that the space is
concession and the business holds no stock. City analysts see scope for
as many as 200 of these Premier outlets within the UK.
The company's cashflow continues to be strong with stock and capital
expenditure well under control and Sir Philip said the board remained
confident of continued profitable growth.
Any recovery, however slight, in the housing market would produce a
highly geared impact on the group's earnings. Against this promising
background the shares are rated a ''buy'' in the City.

CRICKET
DARREN Gough seems certain to miss the fourth Test against the West
Indies after having been taken to hospital yesterday for a scan on the
same foot he broke during last winter's Ashes tour.
The Yorkshire fast bowler was still awaiting the results last night,
but the incident casts another cloud over the future of a player who
just seven months go was on top of the world.
Gough complained of soreness in his left foot when he reported to Old
Trafford yesterday to team up with the rest of the England squad.
Chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth and physio Dave Roberts
immediately sent him to a Manchester hospital for the scan, which should
show whether there is another major problem.
Gough broke down in January during a one-day international against
Australia at Melbourne and was flown home soon after because of the
stress fracture.
Despite taking only six wickets in the first three Tests this summer
against West Indies, the young paceman seemed to have recovered
completely from that injury. But when he told Yorkshire on Friday he was
experiencing some pain they sent him for an X-ray which revealed nothing
untoward.
No decision has been made about summoning a replacement but, if one is
needed, then Essex left-arm seamer Mark Ilott is the likeliest
candidate.
* NEW Scotland B captain Stuart Kennedy leads his side into battle
with Holland at Goldenacre today in a warm-up match for the European
triangular tournament.
Kennedy's plans have been hit by a late double blow with Freuchie pair
David Cowan and Ian Gavin calling off. Only Grange batsman Roddy Smith
has been called up, and coach Jim Love said: ''We'll bring in a twelfth
man just before the start.''
Scotland B -- S Kennedy (Ferguslie), captain, R Smith (Grange), M
Clark (Arbroath), P Duthie (Greenock), S Gourlay (Freuchie), B Lockie
(Carlton), G McGurk (Grange), N MacRae (Aberdeenshire), B Robertson
(Forfarshire), A Storie (West of Scotland), A Tennant (Ayrshire).
SCOTLAND face an uphill task to stave off defeat by Wales in the
three-day Under-19 clash in Abergavenny. They start day two on 41-1 in
reply to the home side's total of 362 for nine.
There was a setback for Scotland when first-choice opener Greg
Butchart was unable to bat because of heat exhaustion, and after
stand-in Dougal Ferguson was dismissed for 10, skipper Dougie Lockhart
and Moffat saw them through to the close without further alarm.

MICHAEL TUMELTY samples the buzz around a unique event touring
Scotland, a classical rap featuring the cream of the nation's young
musical talents, 100 hand-picked orchestral ravers
KIRKWALL'S Phoenix Cinema has seen a few sights in its time,
especially during the annual St Magnus Festival, when anything can
happen -- such as the legendary occasion when pints of beer were brought
on stage to be served to the conductor and leader of an orchestra which
was in full flight.
Tonight, however, the venerable old Phoenix will house something
radically different: a rave. More than that, a touring rave, which will
sweep down through Scotland in the coming week, before swinging back up
North for a final appearance in Aberdeen.
Leading the rave will be Scotland's best-known percussionist, Evelyn
Glennie, and headbanging music will be provided for the occasion by the
hardman lookalike -- but in fact extremely amiable -- composer Dave
Heath.
The occasion is the opening concert of its annual summer tour by the
National Youth Orchestra of Scotland, the young band comprised of over
100 of our finest classical ravers. And the music for the event is
Heath's new concerto, African Sunrise -- Manhattan Rave, written after
the composer witnessed young Glennie going bananas at a drum-kit while
bellowing that she was really a ''rock chic'' at heart.
Heath's original intention was -- borrowing the method from rave music
-- to use sampling techniques in the construction of the rave section of
the concerto. Eventually, he said, this became unnecessary, but Heath
still guarantees eventual anarchy.
Tonight's concert, in which the concerto will be flanked by American
composer Samuel Barber's Essay No 2 and Sibelius's craggily romantic
First Symphony, will not only be the opening of the NYOS tour, but the
culmination of the orchestra's Orkney residency, where young students
have attended workshops and masterclasses, as well as sit-in sessions
with the orchestra itself.
It is also the culmination of a massive piece of work by the NYOS
administration, which has broken some new ground in gaining sponsorship.
Securing sponsorship bedevils every arts organisation. For the past 16
years NYOS has had huge backing and core support from BP. That ends this
year. In beginning the trawl for new sponsorship, NYOS has pulled off a
couple of coups. It has persuaded Sun Alliance to sponsor the Glasgow
concert (to be given in memory of Sir Alexander Gibson) on Monday; this
will be the company's first arts sponsorship in Scotland.
And it has also persuaded two other companies -- Hydro-Electric and
the Bank of Scotland -- to team up in a collaborative sponsorship that,
if not unique, is highly unusual. The electricity company is sponsoring
the tour while the bank sponsored the Orkney residency.
The tireless and talented youngsters of the National Youth Orchestra,
conducted by Stephen Barlow, will be playing flat out every night for a
week, except Thursday and Sunday, before the tour climaxes next
Wednesday in the opening concert of the Aberdeen International Youth
Festival.
* NYOS tour dates:
Tonight, Phoenix Cinema, Kirkwall; Friday, High School, Thurso;
Saturday, Marco's An Aird, Fort William; Monday, Royal Concert Hall,
Glasgow; Tuesday, Town Hall, Elgin; Wednesday, Music Hall, Aberdeen. All
concerts begin 7.30pm.

<HEADLINE>Panel puts plan to unlock #90bn potential of welfare state</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
DRASTIC overhaul of the central pillars of the welfare state,
including asking income support claimants to draw up a career plan and
requiring all employees to take out a second pension, was proposed
yesterday by an independent panel of academics, businessmen, and
politicians.
The recommendations of the Dahrendorf Commission, set up by Liberal
Democrat leader Mr Paddy Ashdown last year, are designed to unlock the
investment potential of the #90bn paid out annually in welfare benefits.
The commission's findings are expected to influence Labour thinking in
the run-up to the General Election. Its members include Labour MP Frank
Field, who chairs the Commons Select Committee on Social Security, and
Mr Will Hutton, the Guardian economics journalist whose thinking is said
to be close to that of the Labour leadership.
Its main targets are income support and national insurance. The
commission, chaired by Lord Dahrendorf, Warden of St Antony's College,
Oxford, starts from the premise that the Government's policy of
concentrating on cutting the welfare state is untenable.
Instead it wants to reinvest money paid out in welfare. Income
support, for example, would be targeted to the needs of each recipient,
who would be asked to choose a career. Their payments would then be used
to achieve that goal through education and training.
On national insurance, the commission recommends reducing the
influence of politicians by creating a new system to be managed by
employees and employers. Benefits will be earnings related and linked to
contributions.
A private pension association would be created to oversee the
''universalisation'' of a second pension to supplement the state
pension. A new national savings scheme would be created to allow those
on low incomes to save for old age.
The commission argues that the large number of poor pensioners, an
ageing population, and the increase in early retirement make it
essential to reform the system.
Those too old to gain membership of Serps, the state pension scheme,
should be brought in, and its value increased. Part-time workers should
be brought under National Insurance.
Lord Dahrendorf said: ''We set out to develop policies aimed at
improving the well-being of the British people. We have met this
challenge with both a fundamental examination of the approach to wealth
in this country and radical proposals for investment, welfare, and
education.''
Mr Ashdown said the commission's conclusions would inform but not
dictate his party's policy. It was vital for opposition politicians to
convince the electorate that an alternative exists, ''that our economy
can be run more effectively and that it is possible to improve the
well-being of everyone in our society without huge economic costs'', he
said.
''One of the mistakes of the eighties was the belief that one party,
one ideology is the source of all sensible ideas and the solutions to
all problems. In that case it was Thatcherism and the Conservatives, and
that's how we ended up with the poll tax. In the decade ahead we must
not make the same mistake.''
The report also proposes a regular ''wealth audit'' to measure the
nation's prosperity. It would go beyond calculating the gross domestic
product, which the commission believes is an insufficient indicator of
wealth, to include employment, environmental conditions, social
conditions, and opportunities.

This is the season to give more power to your flowers, but don't be
caught with gaudy prints or you'll end up looking blooming ridiculous.
Instead, advises Anne Simpson, pluck up a few of the more subtle prints
or let one big bloom go to your head
DID Nancy Mitford get it right when she dismissed much of fashion's
botanical flourish as a musical comedy garden? This year, more than
ever, there is such budding and burgeoning in the rag trade that nature
herself must look to her laurels although, of course, we fool ourselves
if we believe any glorious flowering in the name of style ensures a
perfect mid-summer. After all, when did the weather ever feel obliged to
give fashion the correct temperature and setting?
Still, when dressing becomes entwined with floribunda some ground
rules must apply. For instance the larger flower head, no matter its
fabric, is only worth admiring on the tall and broad-boned. On the
diminutive, the detailed water colour delicacy of meadow flowers are
more effective. So, too, is the material trick of breaking up the
herbaceous border, contrasting the plain jacket against blooming skirt,
or vice versa.
In all this fabrication the velvet gardenia and the tremulous organdie
orchid should not be overlooked. Placed far out on one sholder or tucked
into a cummerbund or operatic breast, such homage to horticulture hints
at drama in a woman, whatever her height.
There again, certain flowery images translated into fashion possess
all the sensual attraction of Dame Edna's belligerent glads. Frankly ,
arabesque florals of the William Morris variety are best left to oven
mitts and wallpaper. Chrysanthemums, even on the wispiest chiffons and
voiles, evoke nothing other than a well-dressed grave, and to be
graceful in a suit of chintz requires the palest watercolors. Otherwise
the effect has more to do with rampant sofas than with chic.
As for millinery, Renoir knew that one rose, large enough and
confidently placed, could turn an honest straw into a piece of art. A
sou'wester can be splendidly pinned back with a cluster of pansies on
the brim, and on boaters or toppers one large daisy softens an otherwise
hard hat.
But the message from all of this is that such clothes deserve the best
of places. Strewn over frocks and skirts and skittish, wavy panamas,
sophisticated blooms lift the nondescript into the premier class. Like
gorgeous peonies in a curvy vase, they should be accompanied by awnings,
Parisian restaurants and attentive beaux.

THE shake-out in the pharmaceutical industry continues. Glaxo
announced yesterday that up to 1000 jobs out of 1350 are likely to go in
its US manufacturing operations at Greenville, North Carolina. The
Greenville site is to cease production of prescription medicines
concentrating instead on over-the-counter medicines.
The rundown, over the next five years, follows Glaxo's succesful
hostile bid for Wellcome earlier this year and a review of its worldwide
research and manufacturing facilities.
While recognising the difficulties that will affect many individuals
as a result of the decision, Glaxo said such action was necessary to
achieve efficiencies and reduce costs in an increasingly competitive
international environment.

SMITHKLINE Beecham has a balanced portfolio of successful drugs which
is just as well since this quarter marks the anniversary of the
expiration of the Tagamet patent in the US ulcer market. Figures
published yesterday were slightly better than the City had been
expecting with profits of #298m up just #7m on the same period last
year. The dividend is going up by 7% to 3.2p.
Chief executive Jan Leschley said growth in the second quarter was
very strong and had been maintained despite tough trading conditions.
Excluding Tagamet and the impact of the #1500m acquisition of
Diversified Pharmaceutical Services of the US, underlying growth in the
key pharmaceuticals division was 11% in the three months to June.
Worldwide Tagamet sales slumped 58% to #73m in the second quarter, a
figure in line with the company's expectations. However, there was
encouraging growth in new products. Seroxat, the anti-depressant drug,
recorded a 49% sales jump to #105m. The antiemetic for cancer patients,
Kytril, saw its sales almost double to #46m.
Havrix, the world's first active immunisation against hepatitis A had
an 82% sales increase. Although there was a 12% drop in demand for the
arthritis treatment Relafen, it is only thought to be temporary. The
decline reflected stocking up earlier in the year.
Elsewhere in the group, boosted by last year's Sterling acquisition
Consumer Healthcare saw its profits jump 54% but the clinical
laboratories business had flat sales with a 3% increase in volumes
offset by declining prices.
A tight rein continues to be exerted on costs with SmithKline seeking
to extract the maximum benefits from its recent shopping spree. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were #590m, #3m lower than the
comparable period last year. Research and development costs totalled
#154m against #147m.
Looking ahead, Mr Leschley said SmithKline would benefit from not
having the drag of lower Tagamet sales in the second half. However, the
rate of growth of the newer products may slow down.
The group denied that it was interested in bidding for Medeva, the
generic drugs company that recently was the subject of merger talks with
Fisons. This denial coupled with the encouraging trading performance
enabled SmithKline shares to reverse an earlier 1p loss and rise a penny
to 562p.
Paul Krickler of Goldman Sachs likes the groupand recommends that
investors be overweight in the stock, along with Zeneca, although the
recent strong run in SmithKline shares suggests that there is unlikely
to be any significant outperformance in the near term.

YOU'VE learned how to handle a boat, your own or someone else's. And
you're thinking of buying one. Do you go for something sleek and shiny?
Or is there equal pleasure in a tried and tested boat, safe and
seaworthy, that leaves a bit in the pocket to pay for various
incidentals? It's a nice decision to make.
On the east coast, you'll probably end up around Queensferry looking
for Jock Blair -- if he's not out sailing -- who has a chandlery
business next to the sailing school, that includes boat sales.
New craft include Hunter, Drascombe, Hardy and Topper, giving a good
range from single-handed fun boat to family cruising. The brokerage
typically includes around 150 boats with price tags from maybe #250 to
over #37,000.
Coming back to the west, Stan Prosser at Blochairn could give you
guidance on what to buy, with a clear preference for motor boats.
''We've been in this business for 11 years now,'' he says, ''and we
decided we would go for the one style, and not try to be
jacks-of-all-trades,'' he says. ''We cater for starter to expert, and
one thing we do is offer every buyer an induction programme -- a means
of learning to handle a power boat, and be safe when at sea. That's so
important.''
For new craft, Stan is fortunate in having sole cover in Scotland for
the prestige Bayliners, plus Cruisers Inc from America, and the NB range
from Norway.
Prices for what the trade calls pre-used power boats are varied:
around #4000 gets a speedboat with 50hp engine, while a massive
34-footer which sleeps eight could be yours for around #35,000.
At Largs, as at Clyde Place in Glasgow, Angus Scott has two new
agencies this year. The Najad is a sailing cruiser from Sweden, and
Seawings (from Hardy Marine) are fast power boats suited to local
waters.
Meanwhile, at brokerage, with Angus Tait this time, there is quite a
range of craft. Who could resist sailing a Rustler 36, going for
#93,000? Or in more family-style prices, a Trapper 300 is under #10,000
and a Hurley 27 is #12,500. Under 25ft, prices are even better -- a 20ft
wooden motor sailer for #6750 and what is known as an E-Boat for #5000.
It's just under #2000 for a Juno 560, a trailer sailer with lifting
keel, to tow behind the family estate.
For power enthusiasts, there is a range from day boats to cruisers. A
dory, with an 85hp engine, comes in at #3900 and at the other end of the
scale is a roomy Broom 37, a displacement motor cruiser, for #39,000.
Making a choice is always the difficulty. The power boats tend to give
you more internal space and more length for your money. The sailing
boats, say their supporters, are simply more fun, they are ''proper''
boats.
What does the marina at Kip offer? There's the Northshore range, which
includes the Fisher motor sailers, popular on the Clyde, the Vancouver
and Southerly sailboats.
Moody yachts have had a strong following here for about 21 years, and
the newer J-Boats are finding favour for both cruising and racing in
local terms. Add to that the Grand banks trawler yachts and large
displacement sea boats with vast internal space, and there is something
to suit everyone.
On brokerage, you can go from a splendid J-44 at #190,000 to a nice
wooden Folkboat at #3995. Power craft include a Princess 45 -- viewing
by appointment only, remember -- at #170,000 or a 25ft Viksund at #6950.
The range is vast, but test and try before you buy, then take your
time in making a decision. It's safer that way.

SPACE Mountain, a simulated rocket flight to the moon, is pulling in
the visitors to Euro Disney which made it into the black in the three
months to June, its first quarterly surplus.
The shares jumped 21p to 232p, and were the top stock traded on the
Paris bourse, as analysts upgraded their estimates for the full year.
Euro Disney itself expects break-even, against losses of Ffr1797m last
time, and analysts are going for profits of around Ffr50m.
In the third quarter there was a net profit of Ffr170m (#22m),
compared with a loss of Ffr546m, though there was an exceptional gain of
Ffr84m arising from the purchase of 9.4% of the outstanding convertible
loan stock, which retired Ffr372m of debt.
The group has been on an improving trend this year as a result of its
financial restructuring, cost-cutting and reductions in entrance prices.
This encouraged more visitors to the park and associated hotels so that
revenue and margins improved. Operating revenues rose 17% to Ffr1360m
(#176m).
The financial restructuring included an interest holiday worth Ffr600m
for the year. Euro Disney is sitting on debts of Ffr15.5bn (#2000m) but
the interest holiday continues until 1997 when the company should be in
better shape to shoulder the full burden.
Apart from debt and relatively high interest rates, the group has had
to contend with weak consumer spending in Europe and the strong franc
which has made France an expensive holiday destination.
Chairman Philippe Bourguignon said the new strategy had been ''very
successful'', as had Space Mountain, which attracted a lot of publicity
when it was opened.
Euro Disney's recovery is running somewhat ahead of expectations as
the group was looking to break even in 1995-96 whereas useful profits
are in prospect now that momentum is building up in the theme park.

THE number of unit trust accounts rose by 70,000 in June to stand at a
record 6.4 million.
With gross sales of #1566m, up from #1357m in May, and repurchases by
the managers little changed at #905m, total net sales for the month rose
to #661m from May's #446m, the highest level this year. However, they
were still almost halved from the #1102m achieved in June 1994.
The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (AUTIF) reports
that increased buying by private investors pushed net retail sales to
#268m in June from #217m (#664m in June 1994). Institutional sales rose
to #393m from #229m.
PEP sales continued to be strong, dipping slightly from May's #229m to
#207m. For the first time this year, there were positive sales of unit
trusts over and above PEP sales.
The UK stock market marked time in June while most others slipped a
little. On balance, the total value of unit trust funds under management
did not change at #97.8bn.

IF further confirmation was needed that the rate of economic growth
was slowing, it certainly came with the CBI's Quarterly Industrial
Trends Survey for July.
Manufacturing output has risen at its slowest rate for 15 months,
reflecting a sharp deterioration in domestic demand although growth is
still being fed by strong expansion in exports and it still points to
faster growth than the official GDP figures for quarters one and two.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, though, will no doubt use this slowdown to
back his case for no change in interest rates when he meets the Governor
of the Bank of England, Eddie George, tomorrow for their regular monthly
monetary get-together.
The Governor will continue to point to Bank of England worries about
inflationary pressures. The CBI has once again spelt out its opposition
to any increase in interest rates but this time it also sought to dampen
any possible premature fears that the underlying recovery was beginning
to falter.
It was noticeable that while Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's
economics committee, reiterated yesterday that there was no case for a
rise in interest rates because there was no sign of cost increases
feeding through to consumer prices, this time he emphasised that there
was no justification for lowering rates at the moment to boost growth.
At the Treasury, the line was that the survey tallies with the view
that UK economic growth is slowing to a more sustainable rate. It also
pointed to an encouraging pick-up in industry's investment intentions in
plant and machinery.
During the next four months, overall demand is set to rise a little
more quickly with faster export order growth -- close to the 18-year
high recorded earlier this year. Export confidence in the year ahead
remains strong though less buoyant than in the last three quarterly
surveys. But business confidence has, on balance, fallen very slightly
for the first time since October 1992, having risen for 10 successive
surveys.
So far as prices are concerned, these have risen more slowly over the
past four months, though cost pressures because of higher imported raw
material prices continue to mount. With fierce competition in home and
overseas markets, the squeeze on margins is likely to persist over the
coming four months. Unit costs have risen more quickly than firms either
reported or expected in April.
The increase over the past four months was the fastest for nearly
4[1/2] years. Companies do, though, expect these to moderate over the
next four months with the expected increase the lowest since last
October. The survey also indicates that capacity constraints have eased
slightly since April.
Capacity utilisation has fallen since April and it is close to last
January's level. Plant capacity as a likely constraint on output has
fallen back from 26% in April (the highest figure since October 1988) to
24%. Firms continue to direct capital spending towards capacity
expansion which, at 40%, is the highest proportion for over five years.
Adam Cole of securities house James Capel considers that the survey
did little to resolve the two key questions overhanging the outlook for
the economy -- the extent to which growth will rebound in the second
half of the year and the direction of the next move in interest rates.
He regards its as encouraging that investment intentions recorded a
further recovery in July and this was mirrored by the first significant
drop in capacity utilisation suggesting inflation pressures in
manufacturing may be becoming slightly less intense. But he says on the
whole there is little in the survey to lift the current statistical fog.
The economy is poised between above and below trend growth and its
direction from here is unlikely to be come clear before the autumn. Base
rates will, therefore, remain on hold with the next move, upwards in Mr
Cole's view, likely to come just ahead of the Budget.

DIEGO Maradona and his former national team-mate Claudio Caniggia have
signed for Buenos Aires team Boca Juniors, promising a dream combination
for Argentine football fans.
''God has given me to Boca, which was what I wanted,'' an
influenza-stricken Maradona said at a news conference packed with
journalists and rowdy fans after the signing ceremony.
Both midfield player Maradona and long-time friend Caniggia, a striker
who has been playing for Portuguese team Benfica, signed contracts for
more than #6m, according to Argentine television.
Maradona has signed until December 1997 and Caniggia until June 1996,
an official said at the ceremony.
The signing officially ends months of uncertainty about what Maradona
would do after completing a FIFA playing ban imposed during the 1994
World Cup finals for failing a dope test.
One of the world's best players in the 1980s, he began a disastrous
and short-lived second career as a coach before offering his services to
teams eager for his playing services after his ban ends in September.
He said he wanted all along to play again for Boca, the club from the
rough side of Buenos Aires he led to championship glory in 1981. But he
also flirted with Brazilian team Santos.

'The circus is a grandiose scheme, but will the money be there?'
MALCOLM PHILLIPS
THE SRU have confirmed that they are to support Scotland's
international rugby squad financially after hearing that the English
authorities have guaranteed their players a minimum of #30,000 for the
coming season and the Welsh have promised their pool #20,000 a man.
''We will take cognizance of what the other countries are doing and
see how we can help our players,'' said Freddie McLeod, the SRU member
on the International Board's amateurism committee.
''I don't know if we can match what the English have to offer -- they
have a massive sponsorship deal in the pipeline -- but I will want to
see how it is financied.''
McLeod is to meet with representatives of the Scottish squad soon for
detailed talks over the level of funding available and how it is to be
distributed. The meeting is also likely to discuss loyalty clauses.
''I will be meeting their representatives soon, and I have been
speaking already with agent Ian McLauchlan. I am keen that we actively
support our players the way other countries in Britain will.''
Speed may be of the essence with the Kerry Packer circus rumoured to
be trying to poach players, but squad members in Scotland insist they
have not yet been targeted.
''I can honestly say that nobody I know has been got at by the Packer
people,'' said recently retired Scotland hooker Kenny Milne. ''But I
have to say that all of the Scottish boys would be interested if the
money on offer is what they say it is.
''I have heard the figure of #150,000 a year mentioned, and there are
very few of us who wouldn't go for that kind of cash. I might even come
out of retirement.''
McLeod will find it hard to bridge the gap between the earnings of the
Scottish team and their English counterparts. England's players averaged
#16,000 a man last season from their promotional work, whereas Scotttish
players received approximately #500 per international, and a one-off
bonus of #3000 for the World Cup, before other personal appearances.
Malcolm Phillips, chairman of the RFU's Players' Working Party in
England, said: ''Next season we will guarantee #30,000 plus. Of course,
we are not competing with what the pro circus is supposed to be offering
the world's top players. The circus is a grandiose scheme, but will the
money be there?''
Last night England officials were due to meet three of their leading
players, Will Carling, Brian Moore and Rob Andrew, and there was a
conciliatory note in the air as both sides said they wanted to avoid
conflict.
The Scottish players are understood to want equality with others in
Britain, and I understand that the existing secrecy over the split of
the money that enters the players' trust is a cause for concern.
One method of increasing the players' earning potential that the SRU
might have at their disposal is to divert more of their sponsorship
money into the trust fund.
The International Board meets at the end of August to discuss
amateurism with McLeod in attendance. Some British countries may not put
up too strong an argment for keeping the old order.
''Whatever happens about intended elite sponsorship for the players or
the IB's verdict, the word amateur is now dead,'' said Phillips.

SCOTTISH champion Bruce Flockhart, recently ranked No.3 in Britain and
46 in the world, has been given a coveted place in the British Olympic
squad. However, fellow Scot Anne Gibson has lost her place in the latest
reshuffle.
Flockhart, a sport scholarship student at Stirling University, has
enjoyed a meteoric rise in the world rankings this year and has just
returned from a largely self-financed trip to the Far East, where he
competed in the Indonesian, Singapore, and Malaysian Opens.
The extra financial support which comes with a place in the Olympic
squad will stand the 22-year-old in good stead and is another step along
the road to fulfilling his ambition of competing at the Olympics.
Both Flockhart and Gibson will cross the Atlantic in two weeks' time
to compete in the US and Canadian Open championships.
Meanwhile, Scotland have been invited to send an elite group of
players to a training camp in Poland from August 7 to 15. Team:
B Sutherland (West Calder), D Forbes (Erskine), K Graham (Fauldhouse),
K McEwan (Bridge of Weir).

NIGEL Benn's ninth defence of his WBC super-middleweight crown will be
one of four world championship fights on the Oliver McCall-Frank Bruno
Wembley stadium bill on September 2.
Benn, fresh from Saturday's eighth-round victory over Italy's Vincenzo
Nardiello, will meet an opponent to be named later this week.
America's WBA light-heavyweight champion Virgil Hill will fight the
Malawi-born Drake Thadzi, of Canada, while Ghana's Alfred Kotey will
also be putting his WBO bantamweight title at stake on the Don
King-Frank Warren promotion.
Hill will be making his nineteenth defence of the title in two reigns
interrupted by his sole career loss to the great Tommy Hearns. He had 11
successful defences until Hearns dethroned him in June, 1991, but
regained his crown in 1993 by beating Frank Tate. He has won seven title
fights in succession since then.
McCall will be defending the WBC crown for the second time since
taking it so dramatically from Lennox Lewis a matter of yards away at
the Wembley Arena last September.

<TEXT>
ALGERIAN running machine Noureddine Morceli came within a fraction of
a second of breaking his third world record of the month on a night of
spectacular athletics action in Monaco.
Morceli clocked 3min 27.52sec to win the 1500 metres, only 0.15sec
outside the record he set just 25km along the French Riviera in Nice on
July 12.
His was the most outstanding performance at a meeting which produced
six world best times of the year -- including one from Ireland's Sonia
O'Sullivan in the 1500m -- as the top track names limbered up at the
last grand prix before next month's world championships in Sweden.
O'Sullivan also ducked under another important psychological barrier
when she became the first woman to break four minutes in the 1500 metres
this season.
She was clocked in 3-58.85, an Irish record, finishing almost three
seconds ahead of Jamaican Yvonne Graham.
Britain's John Regis also produced an encouraging display to finish
third in the 200m in 20.32, behind Namibian world champion Frankie
Fredericks (20.23) and Nigerian Olapade Adeniken (20.31).
Morceli, who also broke the world 2000m record in Paris on July 3,
nearly saw one of his other records removed from the books by Kenyan
Moses Kiptanui.
Kiptanui, who broke the world 5000m this year and set the fastest
3000m steeplechase time of the season, ran the 3000m flat in 7-27.18.
He was just over two seconds outside the record set, ironically
enough, by Morceli at the same meeting last year.
American sprinter Gwen Torrence became the first woman to break the
22-second barrier this season when she won the 200m in 21.81.
She had the extra satisfaction of beating her main rivals in
Gothenburg, Russian Irina Privalova, who was second in 21.87, and
Jamaican Merlene Ottey, third in 22.13.
Both the men's and women's 800m races produced world best times of
1995.
Kenya-born Dane Wilson Kipketer produced an astonishing late burst to
win the men's race in 1-42.87, making him the fifth fastest man over two
laps in history. Kipketer was only just over a second outside Briton
Sebastian Coe's 1981 record of 1-41.73.
Mozambique's world champion Maria Mutola was predictably the best in
the women's 800m, which she won in 1-57.40.
But she was pushed hard by Olympic bronze medallist Ana Fidelia
Quirot, of Cuba, who was second in 1:57.69.
The other best time came from the American sprint quartet which is
expected to run the relay in Gothenburg. Maurice Greene, Jon Drummond,
Mike Marsh, and Dennis Mitchell did the 4x100m in 38.25.
There were some surprising flops, too, amid all the action, notably
from Sergei Bubka and Marie-Jose Perec.
Ukrainian Bubka made a mediocre, for him, clearance of 5.70m, placing
fourth in the pole vault which was won by American Dean Starkey with
5.80.
Perec, who has set herself a formidable challenge by opting for both
the 400m and 400m hurdles in Gothenburg, could do no better than sixth
in the flat race she favours. The event was won by Australian Cathy
Freeman.
The Frenchwoman, Olympic champion over the distance and 1991 world
champion, said she felt tired.
''At 80 metres from the finish, my legs went,'' she said. ''Perhaps I
put too much pressure on myself. Maybe I felt too confident. ''But I'm
still going to do both races in Gothenburg. I'm making no changes to my
plans.''

FRANCE'S Marie-Jose Perec, aiming for a double gold at next month's
world championships, suffered a blow when she was well beaten in her
favourite distance, 400 metres, at the Monaco Grand Prix yesterday.
Perec, who will also run the 400m hurdles at the world championships
in Gothenburg, Sweden, could make only sixth place in a race won by
Australian Cathy Freeman.
The International Amateur Athletic Federation had announced earlier
that the world championship programme had been changed to help Perec
compete in both races. The Guadeloupe runner had planned to break 50
seconds to put pressure on her rivals.
Perec, the 400m Olympic champion, seemed to run out of pace over the
last 200m and finished in 50.88sec. Freeman won in 50.34 with her
compatriot Renee Poetschka second in 50.47 and Jamaican Sandie Richards
beating American Jearl Miles for fourth in 50.59.
Earlier, American Derrick Adkins staked his claim to be regarded as
favourite for the world title when he beat all his main rivals in
Gothenburg in the men's 400m hurdles. Adkins won in 47.79 with Samuel
Matete second in 48.25 and Stephane Diagana third in 48.26.
American Kim Batten won the women's event over the distance,
triumphing in 53.85 from compatriot Tonya Buford (54.00). The two are
expected to be Perec's main rivals over the hurdles in Sweden.
Kenyan-born Wilson Kipketer put in a sensational final sprint to win
the men's 800m in the fastest time of the year, making himself the fifth
quickest ever over the distance. The 24-year-old Kipketer, who races for
Denmark since moving there in 1990, was clocked in 1-42.87, more than
one second ahead of Kenyan Kibet Langat.
Maria Mutola, of Mozambique, the reigning world champion, also
produced the fastest time in the world this year in the women's 800m,
which she won in 1-57.42.
Canadian Donavan Bailey won the men's 100m in 10.05.
Irish middle-distance runner Sonia O'Sullivan was the third athlete at
the meeting to set a world best of the year when she won the women's
1500m in 3-58.85.

* WORLD 10,000 metres record-holder Wang Junxia has been left out of
the Chinese squad for the world championships in Sweden next month.
Wang, who broke with coach Ma Junren after a row last year, performed
poorly at the national trials in May.
Wang, who accused Ma of abusing runners in brutal training sessions
and pocketing their winnings, started her own group composed mainly of
Ma's former runners, but their performance has been miserable.
China will take part in 17 events at the Gothenburg world
championships, with most athletes competing for the first time. Their
main medal hopes are in the women's shot putt and the men's and women's
walking events.
''We do not expect a result as good as that at the previous meeting,''
head coach Kan Fulin said.
China finished second behind the United States in the medal standings
at the last world championships in Stuttgart in 1993 with four golds,
two silvers and two bronzes.

If Jefferies shows any doubt about the wisdom of a flit to the
capital, he will be required to commit himself to Falkirk for an
extended period to lend stability to ambition.
IF YOUR big decision of the day is to ponder over white or red for
dinner, or try and sort out Goodwood's 15-runner Tote Gold Trophy, spare
a thought for Jim Jefferies.
The Falkirk manager has long craved the chance to manage his boyhood
favourites, Hearts, and Friday's sacking of Tommy McLean -- and Hearts'
official written approach to Falkirk last night -- will give him the
chance to fulfil his dream.
However, the club he must survey now is a far cry from the great
Tynecastle days which persuaded Jefferies to spend 15 seasons at the
Edinburgh club as the rock of their seventies' defence.
Having made himself something of a legend at Falkirk, after taking the
Bairns from the first division to the brink of European football,
relative security is there.
Indeed, such is the esteem in which he is held at Brockville, his
chairman, George Fulston, wishes to extend his contract which expires in
December by three, or perhaps, four years.
Although Fulston has never been able to provide the man who served his
managerial apprenticeship at humble Berwick, with a massive budget, the
financial cupboard has never been bare with funds available when needed.
By contrast, the kitty at Tynecastle is definitely empty and with so
many of Hearts' top assets already disposed off, the chances of
improving the existing squad do not look at all bright.
In a way, Jefferies runs the same risk that McLean did 13 months ago.
After having established a solid reputation at Motherwell, he found
the graveyard that consumed Joe Jordan and Sandy Clark swallowing him up
as well.
On the plus side, the Tynecastle players eagerly await his appointment
and there is no doubt that this man of the people will unite a
fragmented and bewildered staff, which, in itself, will fashion
improvement.
However, there is another element to the puzzle Jefferies must solve,
which may nudge him another mile or two eastwards along the M8 towards
the Edinburgh ground.
Property millionaire Jim Glass has been content to spectate through a
flurry of litigation between the existing board and former chairman
Wallace Mercer and most recently, a very bitter McLean.
However, he is likely to meet chairman Chris Robinson later this week
to outline his scheme which will provide millions of pounds for the new
manager and with Jefferies also his preferred option, the Falkirk chief
is secure whoever is the long-term custodian of Hearts.
That is a pretty secure position to enjoy but he will not have the
luxury of holding off, waiting for the outcome of the Glass proposals,
while his contract ebbs away.
Fulston has his long-term plans for Falkirk, including a new #15m
all-seated stadium, which, with planning consent, could be started
before the end of the year.
If Jefferies shows any doubt at all about the wisdom of a flit to the
capital, he will be required to commit himself to Falkirk for an
extended period to lend stability to ambition.
Meanwhile, two sets of supporters, separated by just 30 miles, are
fervently hoping that their club will get the nod and last night the
informed book had Hearts a shade odds-on.
His head, no doubt, will tell him to stay at Falkirk and continue the
sterling work he has started but his heartbeat may drown out these words
of wisdom.
Meantime, I shall have something modest each way on Pilsudski at
Goodwood and hope that buys some red for the food.
Best of luck Jim.

Swindon Town 0,
Dundee United 1
DUNDEE United continued their pre-season build-up with a narrow win
over Swindon Town in Finland last night.
The Tayside team's winner came from Craig Brewster -- a target for the
English club just before he signed a new contract with the Tannadice
side last week.
Brewster made sure of United's second win in two appearances in
Finland with a goal after 36 minutes when an Andy McLaren corner was
headed out as far as Billy McKinlay, whose shot was deflected into the
net by Brewster.
United had an escape earlier in the match when a Peter Thorne header
at the far post bounced just over the bar but that was the only occasion
they were under pressure.
The Taysiders could easily have added to their lead later in the game,
with McLaren, Robbie Winters, and Brewster all coming close.
Manager Billy Kirkwood said: ''This was a tougher test than our
opening game against a local side on Sunday.
''Swindon used a number of substitutes in the second-half which meant
the pace of the game was maintained right through.
''The fact that we coped well with it proved we can be pleased with
our level of fitness at this stage.''
Kirkwood was also happy with the performances of Dave Bowman and
McKinlay, and recent signing Neil Caldwell showed up well when he came
on as a substitute.

THE rental market seems to be getting busier all the time, so if you
want a good place to rent, go for it now. That's the considered view of
Eileen Goodearl, of Euan Wallace and Partners, who has extensive
experience of the business.
''Traditionally, this period was always quite a busy time. Now, it is
just getting more hectic every year,'' she says. ''Students come in
droves, on their own or with their parents. I'm just a bit concerned, if
they leave things too late they won't get the pick of the crop.''
Keeping customers happy is what the business is all about, says Mrs
Goodearl. She prefers to operate on a one-to-one, and a face-to-face
basis, to match properties and customers.
''It has to be done on a personal basis,'' she avers. ''People come
here who don't know the area. They need good advice. And when students
come in with their parents, for example, I like that too. It shows
people caring.
''When you start off with the owner prepared to look for reasonable
letting, you can build up a good relationship with the tenant. It means
that someone in my situation can look to give satisfaction and peace of
mind to both parties.''
It's an approach that keeps a steady flow of customers coming to the
company, for flats and houses, mostly in town, or within an hour or so
of Glasgow. That way, someone like Eileen Goodearl can keep an eye on
things, personally.
There is, for example, Speirs Wharf a well-known development in
Glasgow, overlooking the Clyde and Forth Canal. A great place to sit and
watch the world go by, in the sunshine.
Flats here come with fully fitted kitchens, and bathroom, with the
master bedroom en-suite. There's an on-site leisure centre as well.
Rental: from around #500 a month.
It's a similar sort of figure at St George's Cross. A flat in a modern
development, with an open plan lounge/kitchen, two bedrooms, bathroom
with shower. There's an on-site laundry this time. And it's only a few
minutes from the subway (Underground, to non-Glaswegians).
Keeping to this broad figure, you can look for a terrace villa in
Dumbreck. Handy for the motorway, the railway and the bus. A
lounge/dining room, three bedrooms, fully fitted kitchen, bathroom with
shower. Central heating, garage and garden.
Kelvinbridge comes in around #550. A flat overlooking your private
garden. Lounge/dining room, kitchen, breakfast room, two double
bedrooms, bathroom with shower.
Just a bit more for Kelvinside, where #650 gets you a luxury flat.
Lounge, two bedrooms, fully fitted kitchen, bathroom with shower. Gas
central heating and residents' parking.
Move to Carrick Quay, mind you, and your penthouse flat will come in
nearer #900. Still, you get three bedrooms, split level lounge/dining
room, super kitchen, bathroom. The master bedroom is en-suite and has a
balcony by the way - rather posh. Central heating of course, and a
garage for the Porsche.

PICTURE this, a framed artist's impression of your own waterfront
home. The Resident' Association at Glasgow's Carrick Quay has been
presented with a view of what the completed development will look like.
The presentation was made to John Watson, chairman of Carrick Quay
Resident's Association, by Liliane Roderickson Scottish sales supervisor
for Clarke Homes.
Seven of the apartments have been sold since the second phase of the
development, which consists of 20 apartments and two penthouses, began
three months ago.
The apartments are priced from #69,950 while the penthouses cost
#135,000.
With its nautical design theme and its position overlooking the Clyde
in the city centre, Carrick Quay is the only development of its kind in
Glasgow. Clarke Homes claims that recent sales levels and an increasing
interest in the development is evidence of a recovery in the Scottish
market.

IT may look humble, but Ballantruan Farmhouse has really made the
grade. Listed Grade A for its architectural and historic interest, the
house is right up there with some of Scotland's finest mansions and
ancient castles. Unlike some of its rivals in the property premier
league, it is not prohibitively expensive.
The historic farmhouse dates back to the eighteenth century and stands
close to the River Avon in Banffshire, about six miles north of
Tomintoul.
Its listing was achieved because of the quality and originality of its
well preserved interiors. These include open fireplaces and a wealth of
timber features such as panelling, doors and ceilings.
The wood came from trees floated down the Spey from the ancient
Caledonian pine forest of Rothiemurchus, near Aviemore. The timbers were
then taken to Balluntruan by horse and cart.
The sitting room is particularly fine with two original box bed
alcoves and two corner cupboards, all with pine panelled doors.
The remarkable interior was preserved because it remained in the
ownership of the same family for about 150 years until 1984, when the
last remaining member of the family died - having lived and worked on
the farm all her life. Since then the property has been carefully
restored, with help from the Historic Buildings Department, and now
forms a charming small family home.
The accommodation includes two reception rooms, study, and three
bedrooms. There is about an acre of garden and ground which contains
some attractive trees, including rowan and birch, and colourful spring
bulbs and other flowers. A soft fruit area has raspberries and currant
bushes.
To the side off the house is a traditional stone outbuilding range
with a single garage, byre/log store and stable/tool shed.
There has been a house on the site since at least 1681 and the present
building appears to date from the middle of the eighteenth century.
The property shares its spring water supply with nearby Tomintoul
Glenlivet Distillery - where the water is turned into another Grade A
product, the world famous malt whisky. There is excellent salmon fishing
available to rent nearby and the area remains splendidly wild and
unspoilt.

They say two heads are better than one. But when you are selling your
house are two agents better than one? Every house seller has to decide
how best to market his or her property, but is it worth appointing joint
agents? It all depends, says Colin Strang Steel of Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley, a firm which frequently acting as ''joint sole agents'' in the
marketing of large properties.
Although joint sole agent sounds like a contradiction in terms, it
actualy means that two different firms of estate agents share the
responsibility of selling your property. In practice this means that
either of them can produce a buyer, and the aim of the joint arrangement
is to widen the net. In return, the vendor pays a larger commission than
he would to a sole agent, and it is split equally between the two firms.
''Particular types of property may require two different forms of
marketing,'' says Colin Strang Steel. ''A large agricultural estate, for
example, may call for a national or international agent to attract
institutional investors or overseas buyers, while a local agent handles
the sale of smaller parcels of land to adjoining farmers.''
Where a house deserve both national and regional marketing, but the
national firm instructed has no nearby office, a local estate agent can
provide complementary marketing within a small radius. And if the sale
of a property is complex or difficult, teamwork between two agents can
be an advantage.
''However, if a vendor instructs two agents with similar markets, he
may simply be paying more for a service he could have received from one
alone. He will have cast his net no further and may not have reached the
widest range of purchasers. His aim, instead, should be to use a single
agent whose experience, expertise and reputation will ensure that the
sale of is house is handled effectively at both regional and national
levels.''
In Scotland where even an international firm like Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley has only one residential office (based in Edinburgh), employing a
local agent along with the national firm can provide an effective
marketing package.
''Once vendors have considered carefully what they hope to gain from
any agent they instruct, the question of sole or joint agency becomes
simple. Where there are specific reasons for employing two different but
complementary firms, joint agency can maximise sale opportunities.
Otherwise, vendors serve their own interests best by instructing the
strongest, most reputable, regional and national agent they know,'' he
says.

BY all accounts, Radovan Karadzic is a diplomat's worst nightmare --
self-righteous, evasive, contradictory, and impossible to pin down.
The man who has said ''no'' for a year to the blandishments of a world
desperate for his signature on a Bosnia peace plan follows his own
logic.
He says he believes that the West has never wanted the Serbs to lose
the war. It is probable he is equally certain that, whatever war crimes
charges are levelled at him by the United Nations, the outcome of the
conflict will ensure he never appears in any dock.
Karadzic, his military commander General Ratko Mladic, and 22 other
Bosnian and Croatian Serbs, are the first men to face such indictment
since the Second World War leaders of Germany and Japan.
The charges, announced by a UN War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague,
allege genocide and other crimes against humanity arising from Serb
conduct during the three-year war.
They range from ''ethnic cleansing'' of Bosnian Muslims and Croats to
the slaughter of civilians in towns under artillery siege by the Bosnian
Serb army.
International condemnation has never swayed Karadzic in his conviction
that however much his methods outrage the West, realpolitik will dictate
a settlement in favour of the Serbs.
It is a message he has preached to sustain his people under blockade
from former allies in Serbia proper and the threat of air attack by
Nato, the form of outside intervention most feared by Serbs.
Karadzic, with his trademark mass of waved grey hair, was a hospital
psychiatrist in pre-war Sarajevo.
A dabbler in the cultural life of the cosmopolitan Bosnian capital, he
was known as a poet -- with three published books of verse -- and a
medical officer to the local football team.
Like many others who have become prominent on both sides in the war,
he is not a native Bosnian. The Karadzic family comes from Montenegro.
He entered politics as nationalist fault lines began to presage the
disintegration of old Yugoslavia and quickly shook off any figurehead
status among Bosnian Serbs to assert himself as a durable war leader.
Command of English made him a natural spokesman for the Bosnian Serbs
in the early days when they were courted at peace talks in New York,
London, and Geneva. He proved to be a wily negotiator, well able to
survive the pitfalls of international diplomacy.
Although his relations with Mladic are often said to be stormy, the
two men have been an effective double act in dealings with the UN and
international mediators.
Karadzic has endlessly soothed his visitors with promises of
co-operation which Mladic's army has promptly broken.
In the bull ring of Bosnian Serb politics, he took care to obtain
consent in referendums for major decisions, such as rejection last
summer of a Big Power peace plan.
Armed with popular endorsement, he has withstood constant pressure to
compromise from both Serbia, where President Slobodan Milosevic backs
the plan, and the Big Powers.
Russian envoy Vitaly Churkin stormed out of the Bosnian Serb
stronghold of Pale last year complaining that Karadzic and company had
''fallen victim to the madness of war''.
US official Richard Holbrooke abandoned a peace mission in January,
telling reporters: ''There's no point in shuttling up the hill from
Sarajevo to Pale to listen to the kind of crap that was dished out by
Karadzic.''
Amid all this, there has never been a serious known challenge to
Karadzic's leadership.
The Bosnian Serbs have continued to refuse the peace plan, thwart UN
efforts to curb their defiance of the Security Council, and to add to
the 70% of Bosnia they hold.
On the day the UN charged him with war crimes, Karadzic and his army
were celebrating the capture of another UN ''safe area'' from their
Muslim foes.--Reuter

LARNACA: Police abused and humiliated three British soldiers being
tried in Cyprus on charges of killing a Danish tour guide, their lawyers
said.
Antonis Andreou, lawyer for Jeff Pernell, 23, who is on trial along
with Alan Ford, 26, and Justin Fowler, 27, said they were treated
brutally by Cyprus police when arrested last September.
Police hit Pernell on the back of the head with a gun butt, Andreou
told the court.
Andreas Michael, a police officer at the British bases who witnessed
the arrest by Cypriot police, said police ignored Fowler's request to go
to the lavatory and the defendant urinated on the floor where he was
lying.
The three soldiers, stationed at the Dhekelia base, have denied
abducting, conspiring to rape, and killing tour guide Louise Jensen, 23.
In other evidence, a waiter who worked at an Italian restaurant in
Ayia Napa said that a few hours before the killing, the three soldiers
caused an incident outside.
''They were drunk . . . I mean, offensive and aggressive,'' he said.
The trial continues.--Reuter.

The National Heritage Memorial Fund is under attack again over its use
of lottery grants but, as Clare Henry maintains, it can sometimes get it
right
THE National Heritage Memorial Fund appears to have a talent for
getting it wrong. Its first significant grant created a public outcry
when #13.5m went to the Churchill family for family papers.
Many Scots art administrators now believe the lottery awards have
already done great harm to the arts setting the public against the arts,
giving the public a stick to beat its supporters by, and setting arts
bodies at one another's throats.
''How are we supposed to defend #3m awards to the National Galleries
of Scotland for paintings when the NHMF mishandle their affairs like
this?'' one ex-Arts Council member asked on Monday when it became
apparent that the NHMF chairman Lord Rothschild and staff were flying to
Scotland as a mere token gesture -- and spending more lottery money on
airfares and hotels.
So why was the NHMF so inconsiderate -- some would say downright rude
-- to Scotland? Especially when one if its trustees, Lord Macfarlane, is
a Scot and incidentally, also a trustee of the Scottish National
Galleries which received the #3m.
''We didn't think. The BBC lottery show needed something for their
Saturday night show, so we gave them the news about Pollokshields Burgh
Halls. It seemed like a good idea at the time,'' Perdita Hunt, head of
communications, said.
She had also, she said, supplied the Telegraph and Independent
newspapers with Scottish lottery information and colour photographs in
the hope that the lottery would receive a favourable report from the
metropolis to help assuage the national rage.
''Taking it to the colonies'', was obviously low down on the list. It
appeared last night that three of the pictures were acquired under the
Private Treaty arrangement, which is a deal done between vendor (the
Penrose Estate) and purchaser (the NGS) with tax advantages to both
sides.
The saving here to the NGS is #430,000 and #430,000 to the Penrose
Estate. Many believe it's these sort of arrangements that stop bequests
and acts of generosity from people, other than the super rich, who in
the past happily gave their pictures, books, and treasures to their
local, or indeed national museums, galleries, and libraries.
There is yet another controversial ingredient to this lottery grant.
The Penrose pictures are displayed in the Dean Centre, first nominated
three years ago by NGS director Tim Clifford as the proposed home of the
Scottish Gallery.
During the row about the Scottish Gallery coming to Glasgow, the
building dropped out of sight. Recently it has reappeared in a new
guise: as home to the Paolozzi Museum made possible by a #2.5m grant for
refurbishment from the Secretary of Scotland, and the key to the door
from Edinburgh District Council.
This building, it now appears, will also provide extra storage space,
thus doing away with any need for a new National Gallery of Scotland in
Glasgow.
While the Scottish National Galleries receive #3m, the Churchill
family #13.5m, and the Royal Opera House #55m, Glasgow School of Art has
been turned down by the lottery in its application for funding for a
Centenary Building.
This would help alleviate student overcrowding in what is one of
Europe's most famous art schools, currently suffering 23% cuts from the
Scottish Office.
Not everything the lottery touches, however, is a public relations
disaster. The 27 Penrose surrealist pictures going to Edinburgh's
Gallery of Modern Art are a good example of its positive action. Three
million pounds is a small sum by lottery standards, but these pictures
are worth it.
The trouble with talking things up is that the reality is often a
grave disappointment, but these paintings will bring in the visitors.
The pictures filling the top floor at Edinburgh's Gallery of Modern
Art are stunning. Not all are ''lottery'' pictures. The gallery has been
collecting surrealism since the 1970s. (It paid #1.7m for Miro's
Maternity in 1992.) But the new works do contain some world-famous
images like Magritte's Threatening Weather (1929). Here the clouds in
the sky take on the unlikely shape of a nude torso, tuba, and chair: a
floating dream image.
Max Ernst's picture, Joie de Vivre (1936), depicts a nightmare giant
jungle forest overpowering two small figures while Dali's dead bird
contains an embryo, Tanguy's primeval landscape seems to be underwater,
and Paul Delvaux's Call of the Night (1938) contains four nudes
wandering in a wasteland of candles and skulls.
The #3m has also bought Penrose's archives valued at #200,000 plus his
#600,000 library full of books with special dedicatory drawings by
Picasso and Miro.
Keith Hartley, keeper of art, says: ''The archive is very rich. It's
stuffed with letters and wonderful snapshots of all these artists
including Picasso at Penrose's home, Farley Farm, in 1950. The
collection has been acquired from Penrose's 45-year-old son Antony who
appears in many of these photos as a small boy.''
Penrose was a friend of Picasso, and his first biographer. In the
1930s he bought Paul Eluard's surrealist collection when Eluard, a poet,
ran short of money. He also bought a Belgian art dealer's entire
collection, and at the peak possessed 160 surrealist works. Many have
since dispersed to the Tate Gallery or to collections abroad.
The 26 lottery works comprise 11 separate pictures plus 15 original
drawings from 1936, donated by artists to fund publications for the 1936
International Surrealist Exhibition in London.
Penrose's son has also given five of his father's works to the
gallery. One 1935 Magritte picture, of dice in a gallery setting of
black wool and cloud-scattered skies, says a lot about the lottery. It
is of course a surrealist dice and has come up with all the tens.

THE Scottish Council for Spastics will celebrate its 50th anniversary
next year with a new name -- Capability.
The name -- chosen after research by the council, parents, and staff
-- has been selected to tackle the stigma attached to disability and to
encourage a positive attitude towards those who suffer cerebral palsy
and other handicaps.
The organisation said yesterday that the term ''spastic'' was
outdated. The new name indicated what people were capable of achieving
rather than things they could not do.
The council provides a range of services for children and adults with
cerebral palsy and disabilities resulting in similar needs. Council
chairman Mr George Holmes said: ''There is a strong proactive role for
our organisation in changing attitudes towards disability.''

Tokyo, Tuesday
PRIME Minister Tomiichi Murayama today turned down a meeting with
representatives of Second World War prisoners of war held by Japan,
dashing their immediate hopes for an apology and compensation.
British lawyer Martyn Day, who is advising the group of 30,000 former
PoWs from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, said
that even a letter from Prime Minister John Major requesting that Mr
Murayama meet the group did not work.
''I had hoped that a meeting with Mr Murayama would lead to
compensation being offered by the end of the year. We are to meet with a
senior official at the Foreign Ministry tomorrow, but I think the action
could take from a year to 18 months now,'' said Mr Day.
The group had requested the meeting with Mr Murayama tomorrow, the day
before they give evidence to a Tokyo District court on the hardships
they went through in the camps.
The PoWs want an apology and #15,000 in compensation for all those who
suffered in Japanese prisoner of war camps.
However, despite the Prime Minister's refusal to meet them, Mr Day
said he believed there were signs of a change in attitude towards the
PoW issue by the Japanese Government, which in the past has said the
issue was settled by the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty.
''My initial meetings at the British and American Embassies have given
me confidence that significant progress is being made,'' said Mr Day.
''We were here six months ago, and the signs are more positive now.
It's been a long, hard battle for us, but the British ambassador
confirmed that the case is receiving a good deal more attention.''
Since arriving in Japan at the weekend, the seven representatives have
visited old prison camps, and their schedule for the rest of the week
includes Thursday's court appearance and a meeting with a former
Japanese soldiers' group on Friday.
Meanwhile, China is among Asian countries which have an ambivalent
attitude to Japan's role in the Pacific war, which ended 50 years ago
this week.
Beijing is marking the anniversary with 100 anti-Japanese war films
made since 1949, shown on television.
From 1931 to 1945, China lost 20 million dead and had 15 million
wounded, the largest number of casualties of any country involved in the
war.
The official version is to draw a line at 1945 and say that the
Japanese of today are not responsible for past atrocities.
However ordinary Chinese, especially the old and those who lived in
areas occupied by Japanese, do not all share the official view, despite
the enormous popularity of Japanese consumer products and cars.--Reuter.

YOU don't need to be mad to live in Linlithgow, although it probably
helped if you were one of the people responsible for replacing the
ancient crown steeple of the fifteenth-century St Michael's Parish
Church with the ''wigwam'' which is so prominent from the
Glasgow-Edinburgh train.
When Ogilvie Homes started work on a new development in the heart of
historic Linlithgow, the company felt that the project called for a
sensitive design in keeping with the town's seventeenth-century
streetscape (unlike the nineteenth-century steeple project). It was
decided to find a name which would reflect a sense of place.
Convinced that there has to be a future for the past, sales &amp;
marketing manager Hazel Rore recruited children from the four Linlithgow
primary schools into an environmental competition to research a place
name for the site. The project generated immense enthusiasm, and fierce
rivalry between the schools, especially with #100 at stake for the
winning entry.
The prize was scooped by Springfield Primary with a submission that
the judges agreed was well researched and to a very professional
standard. The name which emerged - Madderfield Mews - echoes the
eighteenth-century dyeing and calico printing industry that relied
heavily on the excellent red dye produced from the roots of the madder
plant , which was commercially grown close by.
Class 6A from Springfield Primary descended on the Ogilvie site off
Provost Road at Linlithgow's West Port with two clear objectives which
linked in with a classroom theme, the nature of evidence. Their task was
to scour the site for surviving or hybrid versions of the yellow
flowered madder, and to find evidence of previous occupancy on the land.
Cork bungs from whisky casks provided ample evidence of a distillery
earlier this century, but the greatest thrill was the discovery of
footwear - tackety boots, no less - which would have been worn by
children of primary school age in the nineteenth-century.
As development of the site continues, the pupils of Springfield
Primary will continue to monitor evidence from the past. ''Which is as
it should be, because children need to know more about the past if they
are to help shape a meaningful future,'' says l ocal councillor Tom
Kerr.
Ogilvie's Madderfield Mews will comprise two-bedroom flats and
three-bedroom mews-style houses at prices from #50,000.
'' And for two young Springfield Primary girls who were living in
France until recently, 10-year-olds Roxanne Poorhang and Sophie Hicks,
the move to Scotland and having to learn English was made more exciting
by delving into their adopted country's past. But they were relieved to
find that their new school chums were equally bemused by weird old Scots
words like tackety

THE Kia Sportage introduction had its spectacular moments, notably on
the forest rally stages between Gartmore and Aberfoyle, and high up on
the ridge above the Rest and be Thankful. Some people insist that
off-road means water-filled gullies and one-in-two descents, but forest
roads are probably as good an indication of a vehicle's real-world
capabilities as any other.
While Kia has been known so far for the little Pride hatchback,
ex-Mazda 121, and for the Mentor saloon, the Sportage is the Korean
company's first leisure-style 4x4, and its first in-house design,
although it relied heavily on input from British consultants. Kia still
plans to be a world top-ten manufacturer by the year 2000, and the
Sportage is another shortish step along the way.
The Sportage is a compact 4x4 without the bulkiness or the sometimes
muscle-bound approach of the big bruisers. One of its very strong points
is price -- #13,150 for the entry-level SLX, #13,950 for the GLX and
#14,950 for the GLX SE, which has air conditioning as standard.
With help from British styling consultants, the Sportage is an
attractive vehicle with no oddball aspects of its body design. It offers
a good driving position, a neatly presented fascia and an unexpectedly
high standard of upholstery and trim.
The two-litre 16-valve engine's 126bhp and 129lb ft of torque are very
similar to those of the Korean car's most obvious Japanese rival. But
the Kia's heavier build cannot be denied. You can expect a 0-60mph time
below 14 seconds, and a test-track maximum around 102mph, with fuel
consumption returns such as 33mpg at 56mph, 23 at 75 and 21mpg around
town.
Lotus's suspension tuning gives the Sportage a very fair combination
of ride and handling, judged by 4x4 and not saloon-car standards. On the
forest roads, which I sampled as driver, front-seat passenger and
rear-seat passenger, it provided an unexpectedly supple ride. Winding
down the gravel-surfaced bends it was easily controllable too.
With selectable four-wheel drive, and a high or low-ratio transmission
setting, the Sportage has some engineering features its direct rivals
lack. However, the price, appearance, interior design, comfort and
easy-driving characteristics will probably provide its initial appeal,
and any suspicions that Kia might begin its 4x4 marketing with a rough
and ready vehicle have been firmly squashed.

HERE is a Scots baronial property in Aberdeenshire which will set its
purchaser reeling. Drumblair House is a country house which dates from
1577 and now provides an outstanding family home of great architectural
importance with turrets and towers, crowsteps and castellations.
The ancient doo'cot in its gardens demonstrates the importance of the
property - only the more important lairds kept doves to send messages
and feed the household.
The house also has an important musical connection.
Scott Skinner, the renowned fiddle player, was a former butler at
Drumblair House, where he composed the Strathspey reel The Laird of
Drumblair, in honour of his employer.
The house has been enlarged over the centuries to match the growth in
importance of its traditional lairds, the Duff family.Now the Drumblair
needs a new laird.
The house includes fine architectural features such as its two turrets
with fish-scale slates and thistles, the castellations over the porch,
its central tower, and stone castings.
The gardens have sweeping lawns, mature trees, a well-stocked walled
garden, and a small paddock.
Drumblair is at Forgue, about 10 miles from Huntly, and the house
takes its water same supply which flows into the Glendronach Distillery,
so the quality should be superb. ''Unfortunately, the water is taken
before the pipe reaches the still, so there is no chance of an
intoxicating bath!'' says William JAckson of selling agents Knight Frank
&amp; Rutley.
The accommodation includes a drawing room with marble fireplace,
dining room, kitchen and breakfast room, utility room, main bedroom with
en suite bathroom, five further bedrooms, two further bathrooms. The
guest wing or staff flat has a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and living
room.
''Drumblair is a delightful family house and with its historic
associations is likely to be of a national appeal. It is well placed for
Aberdeen Airport with regular flights to the south,'' says William
Jackson.
Offers in excess of #290,000 are sought by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
The purchaser will receive a toe-tapping copy of the Reel.

REMEMBER the moonlight flitters? Those folks who used to escape their
landlord (and their rent arrears) by smuggling their goods and grannies
away in a wheelbarrow in the wee sma' oors became part of Scotland's
property mythology in the inter-war period. Nowadays it is harder to
escape from your responsibilities, but there is always the temptation to
try to make your move on the cheap.
Those who are tempted to cut corners when moving house by booking a
second-rate removals firm could find themselves having to pay out more
in the long-run, according to Bishop's Move, the UK's largest privately
owned removals, storage and distribution company.
Stephen Fox, manager of the Edinburgh-based company, says that when
people fail to achieve the original asking price of the house they are
selling, they often try to recoup their losses by cutting corners on the
cost of their flitting.
''Some people think that one way of recovering part of the loss is to
appoint a non-specialist company that quotes the lowest price. However,
this can often be a false economy, resulting in a more expensive move
than if a reputable, specialist firm had been appointed in the first
place,'' he says.
He warns that, as a result of the continuing slump in the property
market, people are leaving it too late to book the removals firm of
their choice.
''Anyone considering moving home should contact a reputable company as
soon as possible and obtain a quotation. In this way the removal company
will know precisely what they are moving, and the customer will know how
much to budget for the move.
''Moving home can be a stressful time but, if you plan well enough
ahead and ask the removal company to look after you properly, the move
itself can be relatively stress-free.''
Bishop's Move claims that over the last few months the completion on
properties is taking place very late in the day, so people are not
booking the services of a removals firm until the final stages of the
move.
''Sometimes we get calls from people wanting to move that week - or
even the next day. Invariably we will be fully booked, and so they will
be disappointed in not being able to book the firm of their choice. Once
you decide you are going to move, and have your home on the market, then
is the time to obtain a quotation,'' says Stephen Fox.
''Forward planning is the key to a happy, relaxed and successful move,
and there is no reason at all why it should be stressful.''

THE go ahead for the motor racing development at Forrestburn has come
with confirmation of support, via Strathclyde European Partnership, from
the European Regional Development Fund. Monklands District Council,
which is the site owner, Lanarkshire Development Agency and the private
developers Inreco mean to provide an opportunity -- thanks to the
planned industrial units -- for Scotland to share in the multi-million
pound UK racing car business. We have virtually no stake in that at the
moment.
A speed hill-climb course already exists, but the racing circuit, with
a 3.2 mile international layout and a 1.4 mile club circuit, is much
grander, taking into account the physical features of the site -- a
redundant reservoir, hill slopes and a patch of woodland.
In an era of rather dull-looking ''stadium'' tracks, it is refreshing
to see designers using natural contours, as at Spa-Francorchamps and
also, on a smaller scale, at Knockhill in Fife, which is hosting this
week's British Touring Car Championships meeting.
With Ingliston in limbo, Knockhill is the only full-scale car and
motorcycle circuit operating in Scotland at the moment, although
motorcycle races are also held at East Fortune. Between 1950 and 1965
there was motor racing at Winfield and Charterhall, Turnberry and
Crimond, Beveridge Park in Kirkcaldy, Evanton on the Cromarty Firth and
-- just once -- at the Edzell air base in Angus.
A circuit might have been built in the Low Parks near Hamilton,
another at Springwood Park, Kelso. More recently, local planners turned
down a New Ingliston project with a thud.
Many enthusiasts still wince at the name Polkemmet. That West Lothian
estate, now a country park, was to have been the location of a major
development which ground to a halt with a rumoured #32 in its bank
account.
Forrestburn, where site work should start in the autumn, is certainly
rather better funded. It offers a link between motorsport and high-tech
industry we should have had years ago, and the revived choice of
circuits may give a boost to the whole Scottish racing scene.

BUSINESS leaders in Scotland are taking a more upbeat view on the
future than those in England, with a CBI Scotland survey showing that
business optimism is rising -- particularly among exporters, writes KEN
SMITH.
The figures contrast sharply with those collated by the CBI in England
where optimism has dropped sharply.
Lex Gold, director of CBI Scotland, was sufficiently buoyed by the
figures in the CBI's quarterly industrial trends survey to state: ''The
outlook is promising, with both domestic and particularly export demand
set to improve.''
Business optimism among the CBI members taking part in the survey is
at the highest in Scotland since 1993. Export optimism has increased for
the fourteenth consecutive survey.
Although a modest growth in orders did not materialise in the last
quarter, it is expected to be restored over the next four months.
Yet it is not immediately apparent what the optimism is based upon.
The figures show that output of Scottish firms was flat over the
previous four months, following two years of growth.
Nearly half of Scottish firms said they were working below full
capacity, an increase on the previous survey, and employment in Scottish
manufacturing fell over the past quarter.
Nevertheless, it is clear that a strong rise in export orders is
giving firms hope for the future. The level of export order books is
regarded as well above normal, and to a greater extent than reported in
the previous survey.
Indeed, it is in the export field that the positive figures are most
marked. In the last quarter there was a small balance of firms which
were more optimistic about their export orders. Yet in the latest survey
it has leapt to 32% being more optimistic than those that are
pessimistic.
Again, more firms are expecting to deliver export orders in the next
quarter than previously, with the only downside being that they do not
expect prices for their exports to rise.
Looking at the overall optimism, however, disguises differences in
various sectors. Much of the export activity is a result of the
electronics, chemicals, and the food and drink sectors doing well, while
construction, textiles and retail are having a tougher time.
In fact, the latest report by independent forecasters Cambridge
Econometrics shows that if the electronics industry is stripped out of
Scottish figures, the country's manufacturing sector is growing below
the UK average.

In this
Motoring
Extra
Ross Finlay
turns his attention
to Citroen,
which has an
active time ahead,
giving the
Xantia a lift
NO major manufacturer has the resources to modify and update all its
model ranges at the same time. One will come to the forefront of
attention, then its place in the motoring headlines will be taken by
another. In the Citroen line-up, interest for the next few months will
be focused on the Xantia, which has just been given a choice of new
multi-valve engines, and will soon appear in right-hand drive form, as
the Xantia Activa, with the company's very latest advanced suspension
system.
Prices for the multi-valve cars start at #12,850 for the 1.8-litre LX.
The better-specification 1.8 SX costs #13,980, the corresponding
two-litre models come in at #13,660 and #14,990, and the two-litre VSX
costs #17,270, almost all the additional price, compared with the
previous figure, being accounted for by the VSX's computer controlled
suspension system.
One of the great attractions of the Xantia is that it is a
particularly stylish car. The neat and logical flow of its lines from
front to back means that it is that rarity, a car which probably looks
at its best seen in a rear three-quarter view. The impression is of a
bodyshell designed as a single simple unit, with no add-on styling
quirks.
Now upgraded with velour upholstery, the 1.8 LX hardly seems like the
entry-level car in the multi-valve range. It has more comfortable front
seats than were fitted to the earliest Xantias, a neat fascia and
central console layout, and much more attractive door trim than used to
be the Citroen habit.
The Xantia has a feature rarely encountered in this or any other size
of car. There is a softly upholstered roll, low down on each of the
front seat backs, to protect rear passengers' ankles.
The new 1.8-litre engine is noticeably perkier than the corresponding
eight-valve. It peaks at 112bhp and manages 114lb ft of torque. The car
will sprint to 60mph in about ten seconds, reach a test track maximum of
120mph, and offer steady-speed fuel consumption returns like 47mpg at
56mph and 38 at 75, compared with 27mpg in town traffic.
In the example I tried, the attraction on the road was not so much in
the way the 1.8 LX performed as in the matching of its controls. Citroen
gear lever movements do have an occasionally gritty feel, but the test
car had such a neat ''correspondence'' of gear change, clutch and
throttle actions that the physical process of driving it was most
enjoyable.
Like all Xantias, the 1.8 manages a good balance between handling and
ride. The long wheelbase and supple suspension deal easily with changing
or deteriorating surfaces. But here it is the two-litre VSX, at least
before the arrival of the Activa, which sets the benchmark in the class.
The VSX is comfortable and well equipped, having 23bhp extra compared
with the 1.8, and noticeably improved torque.
What sets it apart, and justifies the substantially higher price, is
the computer controlled Hydractive 2 suspension, whose settings are
constantly altered to keep the car on a remarkably even keel. Mind you,
if Citroen has mastered this system before any other volume
manufacturer, it is a rather eerie experience on a swiftly taken bend to
feel the VSX counteracting its own inclinations to body roll, while
centrifugal force makes the occupants' bodies tilt. Perhaps Citroen's
next move will be to computer-control its customers and their families.

A BLOOD-FREE interpretation of Robert the Bruce's cleaving of the
arrogant English de Bohun at the Battle of Bannockburn (left), created
by the Edinburgh Symbolist John Duncan (1866-1945), belongs to the Smith
Art Gallery and Museum, Stirling, and has been reproduced as a card for
them by the Friends of the Smith.
The Dunblane Local History Society has sponsored a postcard of the
panelled Doll's House, made in Dunblane in the Second World War to raise
funds for the Red Cross.
Making a new postcard costs as little as #160, and is a way of helping
any museum. The Smith now has a stock of cards to generate income.
Sponsors are acknowledged and receive 100 cards for their own use. Smith
director Elspeth King would like to hear from anyone interested in a

FIRST time on an Edinburgh stage since 1933, a cast of 200 extras (OK,
it looked closer to 50), and a play that straddles 30 years in less than
two hours. Yet for all its fearless ambition, Dan Crawford's revival of
Noel Coward's Cavalcade is curiously lacking in purpose.
It's neither stylish nor ironic, nostalgic nor cynical, joyous nor
witty. With so many extras, you'd think it might feel like a big local
event, but it has none of the sense of shared celebration of the best
community theatre, even while it lacks the pizzazz to make it
convincingly professional. In short, it arrives from nowhere and leaves
the audience little the wiser.
Admittedly it's a peculiar play. A speedy run through the first
decades of the century (if it's half past eight it must be 1906),
Cavalcade is at once a eulogy to an old, class-ridden order, a
celebration of British pluck, and a hazy condemnation of the futility of
war. Coward was charting a fascinating but now distant time, and someone
needs to make sense of it for today.
I'm sure this is possible, but this production just raises questions.
What, for example, are we to make of a (rather good) rendition of
Coward's own alienated Twentieth-Century Blues when it segues into an
unreconstructed Land of Hope and Glory? And what are we to make of
Gabrielle Drake's Jane Marryot, who is melodramatic in the first half,
hits some emotional soul in the second, then leaves us with a
cringe-inducing there'll-always-be-an-England kind of speech?
I could live with the contradictions, it's the lack of perspective
that's frustrating.

THE Minnesota Twins baseball team is so bad that erstwhile fans are
staying away from games even though the team has been giving away
tickets for as little as $1.
The neighbouring minor league St Paul Saints have been having no such
trouble. They have consistently been filling all 6000 seats in their
tiny Midway Stadium.
Part of the reason for the latter's success is unquestionably the
promotional expertise of team president Mike Veeck.
This is the same man who promoted Disco Demolition Night at a Chicago
Cubs game in 1979, an episode that resulted in a hoard of hooligans
running on to the pitch and causing one of the few forfeits in baseball
history.
That incident has hardly dampened Veeck's fire. In St Paul he has made
theme nights a fact of baseball life. And the fans seem to love it. For
example, on ''Two Dead Fat Guys Night'' impostors resembling Elvis
Presley and baseball legend Babe Ruth honour the day on which both of
them died.
On ''Salute To The Man In The Moon Night,'' the twenty-fifth
anniversary of Neil Armstrong's first walk on the moon, a helicopter
landed on the pitch and unloaded Star Trek mutants.
On ''Mime-O-Vision Night,'' instead of having instant replays on the
stadium scoreboard, mimes re-enacted game action, at least they did
until they were pelted with hot-dogs and had to be led from the field by
security personnel.
The most popular Saints promotion was undoubtedly ''Call In Sick
Day.'' For this daytime game, fans were encouraged to skip work. The
team's management even took care of faxing excuses to their bosses.
An unsporting
interjection
THE murder trial of former American football star O J Simpson
continues to hold the American public under its spell. Lengthy live
television and radio broadcasts keep curious fans apprised of
developments around the clock.
One of the few lighter moments came last week when Robert Heidstra, a
witness for the defence, came under cross-examination.
''What are your favourite sports?'', Heidstra was asked by Christopher
Darden.
''Soccer,'' replied Heidstra, a native of France. ''What we call
football in Europe.''
''Anything else?''
''Oh yes. Ice hockey, basketball.''
''American football?''
''Boring,'' responded Heidstra. At which point Judge Lance Ito
interjected: ''Wait until you see baseball.''
Hackers want to
be bad for good
PAT OLIPHANT is a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist who evidently
takes a tongue-in-cheek view of the usually staid sport of golf. And
Oliphant does not reserve his scathing humour for the printed page. He
also works to bring it to life.
Hence the ''Bad Golfers Association Open'' which Oliphant organised at
the Milburn Golf &amp; Country Club in Overland Park, Kansas, recently.
One hundred and forty-two of the world's supposedly worst golfers
descended on the club as groundkeepers shuddered at the thought of all
the divots they would have to replace. But the players approached their
tasks with glee.
''I've been bad forever,'' shrugged Teresa Brimacombe, an insurance
executive from Prairie Village, Kansas, ''and I plan on being bad
forever.''
However, there were others on the course who seemed to have an unfair
advantage when it came to poor play. ''This is the best I've ever
played,'' asserted Veronica Spicer, a student at the nearby University
of Missouri. That was because it was the first time she had ever played.
Player falls
on hard times
TIMES have been hard in the sport of baseball Player recently, what
with last season being destroyed by a strike and this year seeing only
minimal crowd attendance. But maybe things have been more difficult for
the players than anyone has imagined.
Why else would Ed Vosberg, of the Texas Rangers, have been arrested
outside his home stadium in Arlington while trying to illegally sell
four complimentary tickets to the mid-season All Star game. A good
question, for which many in the United States offer a simple and
disillusioned answer. Greed.
$40,000 right
on the nose
THERE is still easy money to be made in the USA. The Supreme Court of
the State of Maine recently awarded Jeannine Pelletier damages against
the Fort Kent Golf Club.
It appears that in 1985, while playing at the club, Pelletier hit a
shot that bounced off some nearby railroad tracks and returned to hit
her in the nose. How much was her poor stroke worth? A cool $40,000.

SCOTTISHPOWER has appointed Royal Bank of Scotland as sole arranger of
a blockbuster #800m syndicated loan to back its #1043m bid for Manweb.
National Power, one of the two main power generation companies in
England and Wales, has meanwhile joined the Labour Party in calling for
the takeover bid be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
(MMC).
ScottishPower faces its shareholders today at its annual meeting in
Glasgow, but company officials said the board is likely to be
tight-lipped about the bid for Manweb.
The #800m syndicated loan for ScottishPower is is the biggest
corporate financing package which Royal Bank has ever put together as
sole arranger.
''We have been mandated to arrange the debt financing . . . and are in
the process of putting all the underwriting together,'' a Royal Bank
spokesman said. He declined to give further information about the deal.
On Monday, ScottishPower offered a cash-plus-shares package for Manweb
worth 945p with an all-cash alternative of 915p.
ScottishPower followed up this announcement by buying a 7.3% stake in
the power distribution company covering Merseyside and North Wales.
It bought a further 1.7% yesterday, when Manweb closed down 2p at 915p
-- level with the ScottishPower bid price.
ScottishPower is now Manweb's largest single shareholder with 9.0%.
Prudential Insurance has been relegated to second place with 6.6%.
The next move in the bid process will be the publication of a
consultation paper by the Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer)
setting out its own views on the bid. This should come out today or
tomorrow.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, is likely to
seek guarantees that consumers would not be adversely affected by the
takeover.
Another of his concerns is that ownership of the power industry does
not become over-concentrated through a spate of similar takeovers.
After Offer states its views, the Office of Fair Trading will decide
whether to recommend a referral of the bid to the MMC.
National Power chairman John Baker said yesterday that the bid should
be referred to the commission because ScottishPower's takeover of Manweb
would upset the structure of the power industry in England and Wales,
created at privatisation.
''One of the primary objectives of the Government back in 1989 was in
the England and Wales markets not to have vertically integrated
players,'' Mr Baker said.
He denied suggestions that National Power was planning to buy a
regional electricity company (REC), saying the authorities would not
allow it.
At present, three companies, including National Power, generate most
of the electricity south of the Border. But power is distributed to
consumers by independent RECs such as Manweb.
In Scotland, however, ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric both
generate and distribute power. They even export surplus energy to
England.
ScottishPower has a statutory period of 28 days to finalise the terms
of its offer for Manweb, but company officials said they expect
ScottishPower to submit a definitive bid within a fortnight.
Manweb will then have 14 days to respond.
Industry sources said the Chester-based company is likely to offer a
benefits package to its shareholders similar to that unveiled by
Northern Electric to fend off a bid by Trafalgar House.
This will probably consist of special dividends financed by increased
borrowing and revenue from the future sale of shares in the National
Grid.
Manweb will be entitled to 5.5% of the shares in National Grid, which
will be worth up to #200m when the transmission network is privatised,
possibly in the autumn.
But Manweb has high operating costs and high tariffs compared to other
RECs and may find it difficult to keep on board the institutional
investors who own more than 80% of its shares.
Bill McCall of broker Tilney in Edinburgh, thinks Manweb is simply
holding out for more money and will eventually capitulate.
''I think at the moment that the deal is done and they are just
haggling about the price,'' he said.
Many analysts expect ScottishPower to raise its offer to clinch the
deal.
Andrew Stone at Daiwa in London said ScottishPower might offer an
additional 50p or more.

STAFF at Hamilton Park were celebrating yesterday after the Scottish
course beat off competition to win a top award.
The Lanarkshire track was voted top racecourse in Scotland and the
North of England by the Racegoers Club.
A specially engraved plaque is to be presented to the management team
by the club, whose members were asked to nominate their favourite
racecourse in various regions throughout Britain.
Hamilton chief executive Hazel Dudgeon said yesterday: ''The views of
racegoers are the most important in the industry, so to win this
prestigious award is extremely significant and very encouraging.
''There is plenty still to do and we are continuing to work towards a
three and five-year business plan.
''We are having to expand our team to meet demand and the existing
staff have all worked very hard.
''We will be continuing to upgrade our public enclosure facilities and
irrigation system as well as trying to tap the potential of the new
corporate membership scheme.''
Perth received the small racecourse award in Hamilton's area, while
the Racegoers Club voted Cheltenham as Britain's premier course for the
third year in succession.

HEVER Golf Rose produced a stunning burst of speed to smash the
five-furlong record at Goodwood yesterday -- but a clash with Epsom
rival Lake Coniston is not on the agenda.
Still last with two furlongs to go in the King George V Stakes, the
filly found an astonishing change of gear to collar Eveningperformance
close home for a half-length verdict.
On the lightning-fast ground, Hever Golf Rose lowered the course
record by 0.06sec.
The conditions were unsuitable for the French-trained challenger
Struggler, the 11-4 favourite, who was never going well and finished
second-last.
Hever Golf Rose, taking her winning earnings this year to more than
#120,000, will now attempt to secure a Group 1 prize when she tackles
the Nunthorpe Stakes over the minimum trip at York next month.
But for the time being she will avoid her neighbour, Lake Coniston,
who showed himself the king at six furlongs with an awesome display in
the July Cup.
''We'll be giving Lake Coniston a wide berth I think, although I might
consider opposing him on a tight track,'' said trainer Joe Naughton.
Hever Golf Rose is the best horse trained by Naughton, a former
flatmate of Peter Chapple-Hyam, since he began training five years ago
after an apprenticeship with Barry Hills.
''Give me the horse and I'll show that I can train them,'' he said.
''Hever Golf Rose is just so tough and she hasn't stopped improving.
''She's done something that Lochsong wasn't able to do -- break the
course record here.
''There were a few doubts about coming back to five furlongs but we
wanted to be sure about going to York and having her firing on all
cylinders.''
Epsom stables enjoyed a great day as Silver Groom, trained by Reg
Akehurst, romped home in the William Hill Cup.
Staffordshire-born Matthew Henry notched the biggest success of his
career as he steered the gelding to a comfortable two-and-a-half-length
defeat of Hunters of Brora.
The victory was compensation for Akehurst, whose horse, Knowth, was
controversially disqualified in the corresponding event two years ago.
But the trainer missed the race as he in the West Indies for the
wedding of his son, Murray.
Meanwhile, Sanmartino looks the pick at the weights for today's
#50,000-added Tote Gold Trophy Handicap.
Barry Hills' colt began his career by running a close fourth to
Burning at Newmarket in April.
The other horses in front of him that day were Luso, who is now Group
1 class and Prussian Blue, who went on to beat Warning Order at
Beverley.
Add to that subsequent wins for the fifth, sixth, and seventh-placed
horses and it becomes clear that it was a hot race.
Sanmartino subsequently opened his account at Haydock the following
month, beating Hadeyya Ramzeyah one-and-a-half lengths, the pair well
clear.
The runner-up has since also gone on to score, so it is obvious that
Sanmartino had no easy opening there.
He has not run since but looks to have been laid out for this and gets
the day's nap vote.
* FLEET Hill, trained by Mick Channon and ridden by Richard Hughes,
could only finish fifth of six to Andre Fabre's Redwood Falls in the
Listed Prix Madame Jean Couturie over a mile-and-a-quarter yesterday at
Maisons-Lafitte.

BUS giant Stagecoach -- which has been hit by a salvo of unfavourable
Government competition rulings in recent months -- yesterday had some
good news to report.
The tough line taken by Corporate Affairs Minister Jonathan Evans, who
recently ordered the Perth-based company to sell 20% stakes in
Strathclyde Buses and the South Yorkshire-based Mainline Partnership,
has done nothing to reduce Stagecoach's popularity among the UK
travelling public.
A 72% increase in annual pre-tax profits to a record #32.6m exceeded
analysts' expectations. Stagecoach shares, which had been rising in the
run-up to the announcement, yesterday put on another 6p to 236p.
Stagecoach increased its total dividend for the year to end-April by
29% to 5.3p, with a final payout of 3.65p.
The main beneficiaries of this dividend increase will be Stagecoach's
founders, executive chairman Brian Souter and his sister Ann Gloag, the
company's managing director.
With shares in Stagecoach having powered ahead from a flotation price
of 112p, in April 1993, the pair's combined 40% stake in the company is
worth about #140m.
However, the rise in dividend is also good news for Stagecoach's
10,000-plus employee-shareholders, who own about 4.5% of the equity.
Boosted by a 4% increase in passenger numbers, turnover from
Stagecoach's pre-flotation businesses rose nearly 8% to #175m.
A 3% fall in passenger traffic across the UK bus industry as a whole
is evidence of the Perth-based company's continuing popularity.
Mr Souter believes the introduction of new buses, improved frequencies
of services, and lower fares have helped Stagecoach attract passengers.
With eight acquisitions in the year to end-April adding #109m to the
top line, and purchases during the previous financial year contributing
#54m, overall turnover was up 77% at #338m.
Meanwhile, Stagecoach has pre-qualified as a potential bidder for the
first eight rail franchises to be offered to the private sector.
It is currently digesting information about Great Western Railways,
which runs between London, Bristol, and Wales, South West Trains, which
takes in Exeter, Southampton, and London, and the London, Tilbury and
Southend line.
The company will also be able to bid for ScotRail, although the
Government has yet to release the information upon which companies will
base their offers.
Returning to buses, Stagecoach puts its UK market share between 12%
and 13% and believes there is still room to expand through selective
acquisition towards the 20% level, in the medium term.
Looking overseas, the bus company recently moved into Portugal and
company secretary Keith Cochrane predicted more overseas opportunities
in the current financial year.
During the year to end-April, Stagecoach investigated projects in
Asia, Australasia, North and South America, Africa, and Continental
Europe.
It currently runs about 1000 of its 7000 buses overseas, in New
Zealand, Kenya, Malawi, and Hong Kong.
Purchases made during the year included Kilmarnock-based Western
Scottish and A1 Buses, which also covers Ayrshire.
The A1 purchase is currently being investigated by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Stagecoach is also awaiting a report on an MMC inquiry into bus
services in North-east England. Operators there have complained about
alleged anti-competitive behaviour by Busways Travel Services, which was
acquired by the Perth-based company last July.
After yesterday's results, the consensus forecast for current-year
pre-tax profits is likely to move up towards the #44m level.

SCOTTISH Milk, the successor to the Scottish Milk Marketing Board, has
re-organised its arrangements for selling milk by entering into
long-term contracts with its major customers, writes ROBERT ROSS.
The new contracts mostly cover a 12-month period and are individually
negotiated at prices relating to the service levels required by each
customer.
Among those covered by the new arrangements are Scottish Pride, The
Cheese Company, the Caledonian Cheese Company, Robert Wiseman &amp; Sons,
and Hamilton's Dairies.
Jack Pirie, managing director of Scottish Milk, said the new
arrangements would provide security and continuity to the company and
its customers.
''Discussions on the new arrangements have been going on for some time
and each contract has been tailored to the needs of individual
customers,'' said Mr Pirie. ''We believe that we will create together a
sustainable long-term trading relationship.''
Jim Hosea, chief executive of Scottish Pride -- Scottish Milk's
largest customer -- said yesterday's announcement should lay to rest
rumours that Scottish Pride was seeking to secure milk through
individual contracts with farmer producers. The new contract provided
ample proof of Scottish Pride's wish to continue with what had been a
very satisfactory commercial arrangement,'' he said.
The main thrust of the new arrangements is to replace option contracts
with longer-term agreements. The option contracts covered one month only
with volumes based on the quantity of milk purchased in the previous six
months. Contracts were issued eight weeks in advance of supply giving an
option to buy a fixed volume at a fixed price.
The majority of Scottish Milk customers are on the new one-year
contracts. The prices being paid by individual customers were described
by Scottish Milk as commercially sensitive.
The short to medium-term market is catered for at Scottish Milk's
regular auctions.

ON PAPER, Donald McInnes is just the kind of man you want to hear
performing a solo viola recital. Appearances with the New York
Philharmonic, Boston Symphony and l'Orchestre Nationale de France
suggest a successful career, but last night's recital, as part of the
1995 International Workshops Series, tends to the contrary.
McInnes's teaching skills are much sought after and were in fact put
on display in Benjamin Dale's Introduction and Andante for Viola Sextet.
Inviting five of his former pupils to join him, McInnes was surrounded
by a formidable group of violists who produced the highlight of the
evening. The danger in scoring for six violas (quite apart from the
jokes it could provoke) is one of textural clarity. However, Dale's
clever combination of plucked and bowed notes presented a perfectly
balanced ensemble. It was a wildly romantic piece, and leader Martin
Kelly of the Academy of Ancient Music sculpted the undulating melodic
lines with intoxicating charm.
McInnes's showpiece was Hindemith's Opus 11 Sonata in F major.
Although capturing the idiosyncracies of Hindemith's style -- syncopated
rhythms, modal harmonies, and passages of stunning lyricism -- there
remained something lacking in the performance. This piece ought to jump
off the fingerboard with a sure sense of dramatic pacing but the
showmanship wasn't convincing enough.
That said, a concluding trio of viola miniatures finally gave a
glimpse of McInnes the performer and brought home the excellent
accompanying skills of Jean Barr who provided impeccable support
throughout.

AGRICULTURAL advisers to some of of Scotland's leading banks have
indicated that they would have difficulty in accepting loan applications
from British Coal tenant farmers under conditions of sale currently
being proposed.
Representatives of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Clydesdale, and the
TSB have met with the tenant farmers committee and expressed concern
that farmers buying their properties could, in future, face the
possibility of massive costs for cleaning up pollution from old mine
workings.
After scrutinising the conditions of sale with regard to pollution
David Douglas, of the Clydesdale said: ''Unless that clause is modified
and we get some form of indemnity from British Coal it would be very
difficult to see how we could assist with loans.''
Donald Macrae of the TSB said that his advice to tenant farmers was
still that the environmental pollution clause would have to be
re-negotiated.
In the meantime, the whole process of selling off British Coal farms
is more or less grounded, said James Wilson of Lumphinnans, one of the
tenant farmer leaders.
''Our legal advice and the banks' legal advice is that under the
proposed conditions of sale responsibility for pollution passes to the
purchaser,'' he said. Anyone who required to borrow a substantial sum to
finance the purchase of their farm would have difficulty in getting a
loan.
The banks concern is two-fold. A serious pollution problem arising
from old mine workings could result in massive costs for their client,
possibly resulting in bankruptcy. As the holders of a standard security
over the property the banks fear that they themselves could eventually
be held liable under the Government's new ''polluter pays'' legislation.
Mr Wilson pointed out that pollution fears were a reality and not just
a vague possibility in the future. Some farms had on them burns already
running red with water seeping from old mine workings.
The pollution problem will be raised with DTI Minister Richard Page.
''He has previously indicated that if material issues arose during the
legal process they would be dealt with at that time,'' said Mr Wilson.
''If these issues had an impact on value that was to be reflected in an
adjustment to the ourchase price. There can be nothing which affects the
purchase price more than a condition of sale which stops the banks from
lending.''
He warned, however, that a reduction in purchase price could not
remove the fear of being landed with a bill of hundreds of thousands of
pounds for future pollution.
John Dale, legal adviser to the farmers, has drafted an alternative
set of conditions of sale for submission to British Coal's lawyers. ''We
need a suitable warranty on environmental pollution matters binding on
British Coal, their predecessors (the old National Coal Board) and their
successors the Coal Authority,'' he said. He pointed out that the Coal
Authority, as a residual body, was only expected to have a lifteime of
about 10 years. Who would assume responsibility after that? he asked.
Stuart Oliver, head of public relations for British Coal, said that
most tenant farmers had been on the land for many years and probably had
a better idea than British Coal about pollution risks.
''The bottom line is that we have had an extremely good response
throughout the country with 233 acceptances and 35 refusals from a
portfolio of 500 units,'' he said.
In Scotland agreements on price have been reached for 35 properties
out of a total of 56 on offer. These are not legally binding, however,
and could fall victims to the banks' reservations about conditions of
sale.

ALAN MASSIE's portrait of Sir Walter Scott, The Minstrel and the
Shirra, is a proper wee play, with two acts and an interval, and set
among a tasteful collection of period furniture depicting the writer's
study in meticulous naturalistic detail. There's no theatrical trickery
or understated allusion here. Robert Paterson, in the role of Scott,
eats real food, washes himself in real water, and smokes real cigars as
he recounts the events of his life leading to his present straitened
circumstances, interspersed with anecdotes and musings.
It's a simple, no-nonsense piece, entirely befitting Massie's reading
of Scott as a robust, down-to-earth character; a man drawn to action and
the military, favouring ''war-like verses'' over effete romanticism. Sir
Walter may be suffering the poverty and destitution of many romantic
writers of his time, but he responds with dogged determination, not
despair.
At times the simplicity of the staging threatens to pall. Paterson
moves from direct frontal address to the audience to a fixed number of
locations around the set. His monologue is broken up at regular
intervals by plaintive ballads and harp music performed live by Elspeth
Smellie.
At times the linear unfolding of the narrative seems to lack subtlety
and sophistication. Events are spelled out to us, and Sir Walter's
character is sketched with little ambiguity. But the very simplicity of
the structure, not unlike the ballads which Scott held so dear, allows
Paterson to indulge his talents as a comfortable and engaging
story-teller, and creates space for the pure beauty of Elspeth Smellie's
music; capturing the nostalgia for a Scotland which ''brings together
the past and the present''.

MOTOR RACING
DAMON Hill yesterday held out an olive branch to world champion
Michael Schumacher in a bid to cool their feud before this weekend's
German Grand Prix at Hockenheim.
A day after Schumacher claimed the Englishman was too moody to be able
to solve their personal differences, Hill said: ''We should sit together
during the drivers' parade before the race to show we are sportsmen.
''Normally the drivers from the same team sit together (in the parade
before the race), but this act would make a point. I hope Michael will
do it.''
Hill and Schumacher have been involved in a war of words in the past
few months. Before the British Grand Prix, Hill accused Schumacher of
being a clone and a product of his sponsors.
The German criticised Hill's driving at Silverstone, which led to both
drivers being forced out of the race after a crash.
Schumacher said earlier this week that he hoped fans would give Hill a
good reception at Hockenheim, but added that there was little point in
them sitting down to discuss their differences. ''It is difficult,
because he is too moody and I have problems with moody people,'' he
said.
''We could sit down together if he was in the right mood. But often
five minutes later he is a different person -- everything is forgotten
and he has turned everything around.''
Schumacher was talking at the track where he began racing go-karts as
a youngster. He gave a demonstration of high-speed racing in a kart and
was just as swift at fending off recent media allegations of tax
evasion.
He has been accused of not spending enough time in his residence in
the tax haven of Monaco, but said: ''I had to laugh at the reports.
There is a special rule that sportsman and other personalities should --
not must -- spend most of their leisure time in Monte Carlo. They can
see how often I am there.''
Schumacher has yet to win a race on home soil. This season he has two
chances -- the German Grand Prix this weekend and October's European
Grand Prix at the Nuerburgring.
''I have a special motivation to win in Germany,'' said Schumacher.
''I have not done it yet and it is a great challenge. To win both races
in front of my home public would surpass everything I have ever done.''

Elizabeth Clark finds Susanne Stanzeleit warming to the task of
performing some of Beethoven's most technically difficult pieces for
piano and violin.
GOLFERS have the Open, tennis players Wimbledon, climbers have Everest
and athletes the Olympics. But what do violinists have? Cycles of
sonatas from Mozart, Delius or Bartok can present a tough assignment,
but the ultimate challenge comes in the sonatas for violin and piano by
one Ludwig van Beethoven.
Meeting the challenge this weekend is the young German violinist
Susanne Stanzeleit who will be joined by her regular pianist Gusztav
Fenyo. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night the duo will perform the
complete cycle of sonatas in the intimate surroundings of the Cottier
Theatre.
For Stanzeleit, the graduation to Beethoven comes after a highly
acclaimed cycle of Bartok's complete works for violin and piano. Having
first met Fenyo at the 1989 International Bartok Seminar in Hungary, the
duo have been maturing and expanding their repertoire. Stanzeleit
regards their Beethoven recitals as ''the next big challenge''.
But what is it about the Beethoven cycle which is so special? ''It's
the dream of all violinists to perform this cycle. Beethoven was never
uncompromising and nowhere is this more evident than in these sonatas.
No two are the same and all offer different challenges for the
performers.''
Spanning a large proportion of Beethoven's productive years, the
sonatas for violin and piano are a rich and varied collection revealing
the eclectic nature of his musical imagination. Stanzeleit has taken the
standard decision not to perform the sonatas in chronological order. ''I
don't think that's really possible because both the Kreutzer and the C
minor sonatas are such incredible works that they have to be programmed
at the end of a recital.''
Often neglected in favour of contemporary piano sonatas, the early
Opus 12 sonatas provoke a strong reaction in Stanzeleit.
''So often they're underestimated and regarded as student works, but
you can't play them like a student. They appear technically easy but in
actual fact they're not. There's nothing extreme or crazy about them
like many of the other sonatas but they're wonderful.''
In actual fact, Stanzeleit picks out the A major Opus 12 No 2 as one
of her favourites. ''The unusual opening theme provides no obvious line
to follow and that creates a great atmosphere during a recital.''
Familiar to any student of the violin, the F major Spring sonata is
probably the most popular violin sonata ever composed. ''In this sonata
you finally get to play a catchy tune which sticks in the minds of the
audience. But of course it soon develops into typical uncompromising
Beethoven.''
On the monumental Kreutzer sonata, Stanzeleit is unflinching. ''It's
actually the easiest to play since it's more like a concerto for both
violin and piano. Both of us have equal opportunity to show off.''
A 10-year gap separates the composition of the Opus 47 Kreutzer and
the Opus 96 G major sonatas and the two couldn't be more contrasting.
''The G major is much more advanced; you think it's all lyrical but it's
not. I approach it like a conductor would and immerse myself in real
music-making. The last movement is quite extraordinary -- there's
nothing quite like it in any other violin sonata.''
Stanzeleit is quick to recognise the importance of a good pianist.
(The sonatas were of course composed for violin and piano). ''Gusztav
enjoys and understands Beethoven, having already performed the complete
cycle of 32 piano sonatas. Having an expert at the keyboard can teach me
such a lot. I'm very good at reading musical lines, but Gusztav
interprets the structure of the score and that combination of sensitive
violin phrasing and clear piano harmonies really works.''
On the place of complete cycles in the performance circuit, Stanzeleit
has strong views. ''They're so important and the benefits fall to both
the performers and the audience. By focusing on one particular composer
or period, everyone can really concentrate and learn so much rather than
hearing snippets and excerpts as had happened in the case of Classic
FM.''
In aid of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, the recital
testifies to the mission statement of allowing deaf people to realise
their full potential as individuals: the G major Opus 96 sonata was
written after Beethoven had overcome the emotional trauma of his
deafness.
The Goethe Institut has kindly donated a piano for the occasion and in
keeping with the Germanic theme, a selection of German beers will be
available from the Cottier Bar throughout the weekend.
* Susanne Stanzeleit and Gusztav Fenyo perform Beethoven at the
Cottier Theatre, Hyndland, Friday to Sunday, 8pm.

UNDER-25 CHAMPIONSHIP
HAVING made only the first halfway cut of his professional career
earlier this season, Hilton Park's Stewart Russell found himself sharing
the lead in the Scottish Under-25s championship at Westerwood with an
opening three-under-par 70 suffering from a sprained ankle.
The beefy 24-year-old assistant injured himself during a round at the
weekend and struggled across the 6721-yard Seve Ballesteros-designed
course in baking heat having been unable to secure the services of a
caddie.
''I'm just pleased to get around there,'' admitted Russell, who was
joined by rookies Andrew McKenna, of Sutton Green, and Guy Redford, of
Turnberry, in pole position. ''Hopefully my ankle will stand up but it
is so rocky out there in places. Luckily it's not affecting me when I'm
hitting shots.''
Russell rattled off five birdies and just two bogeys to edge a shot
clear of Glasgow's John Greaves.
McKenna's seven-hour drive from Surrey proved worthwhile. The
21-year-old, whose parents originally hail from north of the Border,
collected five birdies.
Redford, a former Scottish boy and youth cap, enjoyed the services of
Walker Cup team member Graham Rankin as caddie. The 24-year-old would
have led outright had he not closed with a double bogey at his closing
hole, the 548-yard ninth. Leading scores, *denotes amateur:
70 -- S Russell (Hilton Park).
71 -- J Greaves (Glasgow).
72 -- N Scott-Smith (Dullatur), G McFarlane (Clydebank and District),
P Wardell (Longniddry).
74 -- J Wither (Paisley), S Harrier (Craigie Hill), D Herd (Alloa), J
McCreadie (Buchanan Castle), D McKenzie (Brunston Castle), D Ross
(Drumpellier).
75 -- *C Lee (Stirling), A MacKenzie (Gleneagles Hotel), S Catlin
(Westerwood), B Reid (Turnberry Hotel), R Aitken (Kilmarnock Barassie).

THE Loch Long class's Old Firm of Kevin Rickerby and Duncan Farquhar,
one of the championship's more regular title winners, yesterday teamed
up and worked Sula out from the pack in the very light airs to contrive
a narrow victory.
The direction of the first mark proved largely academic since there
was so little breeze and the primary motive power proved to be only the
tide. Having fought around half of a large triangle course at little
more than walking speed, a south-westerly wind of 12 knots finally
breathed some life into the race.
The race committee chose not to take account of this new wind
direction and thus spinnakers were held on all the following three
tight-reaching legs, including the very unconventional requirement to
tack the spinnakers at the Strone mark.
Leader Iceni, sailed by Ian Harris, made more of a mess of this
manoeuvre than Sula. Although both boats hit the buoy it was Rickerby
and Farquhar who extracted themselves quickest to take first gun and a
provisional overall lead. Result:
Race 3 -- 1, Sula (D Farquhar); 2, Iceni (I Harris); 3, Rebel (M
Caldwell); 4, Boomerang (G Hutchinson); 5, Gaudeamus (A Maconochy).

LONG-TERM action to regenerate 20 of England's most run-down council
estates is succeeding against the odds, a report claimed yesterday.
But the survey by the Joseph Roundtree Foundation warned that what had
been achieved could be swept away by growing social problems.
Half of the estates which were first monitored in 1980 are in London
and the rest are scattered throughout England.
Just over a third of tenants on the estates had jobs in 1991 and the
proportion of lone parent households was four times the national
average.
The report found that rescue initiatives, including local estate-based
management and greater tenant involvement in decision-making, had led to
better physical conditions and more community facilities.
Fewer houses were empty at the same time and there had been reductions
in the amount of vandalism and litter.
Investment by central and local government had improved the
environment and all the changes had helped to contain increases in
crime.
The authors, Anne Power and Rebecca Tunstall, of the London School of
Economics, said that, thanks to sustained investment, the landlords and
tenants had succeeded in swimming against the tide.
However, they urged the setting up of programmes to support vulnerable
families and to tackle deep-seated employment problems through
education, training, and work-sharing.

FIVE TOURS WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
BARRY Lane claimed two of the biggest scalps of his career yesterday
when he beat Ryder Cup team-mates Bernhard Langer and Seve Ballesteros
to win the European section of the Andersen Consulting World
Championship of Golf at the Oxfordshire Club.
Ascot-based Lane, who was 35 last month, was four under par when he
beat Langer 3 and 1 in the semi-finals, but it was his 4 and 3 victory
over Ballesteros that caused the greatest surprise.
''To beat both my heroes in one day is a very nice feeling,'' said
Lane, who felt his defeat by Chip Beck in the last Ryder Cup -- after
having been three up with five to play -- had helped him.
''When I played Chip, I was three up, thought I had won and relaxed.
It taught me that in matchplay you must play the course, forget about
who you are playing and if you get a lead, keep hitting the greens and
force the other guy to make birdies.''
Ballesteros had played superbly to beat Sweden's Jesper Parnevik 3 and
1 in the morning semi-final, but Lane began with four birdies in his
first seven holes in the final to open up a five-hole lead.
The 38-year-old Spanish maestro was clearly getting discouraged as
Lane sank putt after putt to move six up at the ninth -- a hole
Ballesteros should have won.
Lane was 70 yards short in two and Ballesteros was on the green just
20 feet from the pin, but Lane pitched to 18 inches for his par 4 and
the Spaniard three-putted for a 5.
Ballesteros gained temporary reprieve with winning birdies at the
twelfth and thirteenth to pull back to four down, but two halves in par
at the next two holes gave Lane victory.
He now goes forward to the world finals in Arizona on December 30 and
31, which also involve the winners of the American, Japanese and Rest of
the World sections.
''I don't normally do anything on New Year's Eve, so it should be
quite nice to have a hot new year,'' said Lane, who will meet Japanese
winner Masahiro Kuramoto in the semi-finals in Arizona.
Lane will be guaranteed some #200,000 in prize-money and will be
aiming for a million-dollar first prize, which would be the biggest
cheque of his life.
Nevertheless, Ballesteros was not too unhappy with his defeat. ''That
is the good thing about losing,'' he said. ''I don't have to go to
Arizona on New Year's Eve.''
South African David Frost won the Rest of the World title, which was
held in conjunction with the European event, when he beat Robert
Allenby, of Australia, 3 and 2 in the final.
In the Arizona finals, Frost will meet the winner of the American
section, which will be decided next week in Wisconsin. Results:
European semi-finals -- B Lane (Britain) beat B Langer (Germany), 3
and 1; S Ballesteros (Spain) beat J Parnevik (Sweden), 3 and 1. Final --
Lane beat Ballesteros, 4 and 3.
Rest of the World semi-finals -- D Frost (S Africa) beat S Elkington
(Australia), 4 and 3; R Allenby (Australia) beat C Parry (Australia), 2
and 1. Final -- Frost beat Allenby, 3 and 2.
* GARY Collinson, of Windyhill, and Campbell Elliott, of Dubai, both
carded four-under-par 66s yesterday to share the top prize at the
Aberdeen Petroleum Club Ladies Pro-Am at Ballater. Leading scores:
66 -- G Collinson (Windyhill), C Elliott (Dubai Creek). 67 -- L Vannet

<HEADLINE>Murray International reports return of 10.9%</HEADLINE>

GLASGOW-based fund management group Murray Johnstone's flagship Murray
International Trust will not be rushing to increase its relatively low
exposure to Wall Street, which it considers ''richly valued'' after
recent rises, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Hopeful of a further easing of German interest rates by the Bundesbank
in the autumn, which would be likely to boost other European bourses,
Murray International will remain overweight on the Continent.
In the six months to end-June, the income-orientated trust made a
total return on net asset value of 10.9%, better than one of 9.1% for
the All-Share index but poorer than a total return of 13.5% on the FT
Actuaries World index-ex Japan.
Net asset value itself rose 7.6% to 354.6p. In capital terms, the
All-Share gained 6.7% and the World index rose 11.8%.
As previously forecast by the trust, the total dividend for the
current year will be 5% higher at 12.6p, made up of three quarterly
payouts of 2.9p and a final dividend of 3.9p.
Murray International forecasts an interim dividend of 9.0p for 1996,
with the final payout yet to be determined.
During the six months, Murray International benefited from a recovery
in world stock markets, which was aided by solid bond markets.
Japan was the only major market which performed badly, recording a
negative return of 10.3% in sterling terms. This did not concern Murray
International, which does not invest in Japanese stocks because yields
are too low to fulfil its ''high and growing income'' promise.
The US market, with a return of 18.1%, was the best performer.
Murray International manager David Briggs said: ''The strength of Wall
Street has certainly been a surprise, on a number of historical
criteria. It would look to be quite richly valued.''
The #426m fund is, by historical standards, not heavily invested in
the US at the moment. The country accounts for only about 17% of the
portfolio, having at one time made up 37%.
Murray International has 44% of its portfolio in the UK, with the
remainder of Europe comprising 23% of the fund. About 15% is invested in
the Far East and Australasia.
The valuation of Murray International's holding in unquoted merchant
banking group Robert Fleming leapt about #10m to #37m.
However, this was the result of a change in a key element of the
complex mechanism by which Fleming calculates the value of its shares.
Their value jumped after a leading merchant bank which is included in
the calculation formula cut its dividend.

THE decision by the telecoms regulator to allow British Telecom to
raise line rents by any figure it chooses is alarming, but there is more
to it than just setting BT free on this aspect of pricing policy.
Essentially the decision by Oftel has little to do with improving the
deal to the domestic customer in the short term, and everything to do
with introducing genuine competition into an industry in which the
concept of liberalisation of communications is still a dream. The
figures tell the story adequately. British Telecom dominates the market,
despite the large number of much smaller firms struggling to gain a
toehold. BT has nearly 90% of telecoms services and controls very nearly
all connections to customers throughout the country. This is not a
healthy situation, especially in a sector which was one of the earliest
to be privatised and in which great benefits to the customer from
competition were predicted by the ideologues who have, as usual, got it
wrong.
Faced with this problem, and with the requirement to make
privatisation work, the regulator has listened to BT's frequent
complaints that line rents do not pay for providing and maintaining the
structure and that the cost of rents has been too low while the cost of
calls has been too high. The regulator is clearly hoping for a trade-off
in the future. If BT is freed to set its own line rents it will have to
accept proposals which will lead to a significant expansion of genuine
competition, and this in itself should lead to a better deal for the
customer. That, at least, is the theory and the hope; reality may turn
out to be different. Oftel clearly expects that BT will develop a
broader range of commercial packages which will enable customers to
choose the blend of line/call costs which suits them best. This may,
indeed, happen, but it is reasonable to wonder why BT has not come
forward with proposals of this sort in the past. The regulator's
determination to make sure that those who make the fewest calls (usually
the elderly) will not pay bills higher than the rise in inflation is
welcome, and the intellectual thrust of the arguments behind his
decision is clear and sensible within the existing framework.
Nevertheless, some anxieties remain. Whether the latest proposals work
depends entirely on decisions made by BT. The company will take the
chance to raise more of its revenue from line charges and less from
calls but the balance struck, and the packages offered to the public,
will be crucial to the maintenance of the public interest. BT, which
will reveal profits of around #114 a second today, should move
carefully. The rest of us must watch, wait, and listen.

SCOTTISH Labour women activists yesterday expressed shock after party
leader Tony Blair signalled the end of all-female shortlists for
parliamentary seats.
Mr Blair said the policy had ''not been ideal'' and would be dropped
after the General Election.
The ruling on all-women shortlists, which is intended as a fast track
to increasing female representation at Westminster, applies to marginal
seats where the party is within a 6% swing of victory and to safe Labour
seats where the sitting MP is retiring.
There are six such seats in Scotland, so three of them will have to
produce all-women shortlists. Ayr and Stirling have already agreed to do
this and an Aberdeen constituency could be the third.
Although Labour has more women MPs than any other party, the figure is
only 39 out of a total of 269. Only four of its 49 Scottish MPs are
women.
Many women activists are angry that a policy adopted under former
leader John Smith and endorsed by party conferences is to be abandoned
after the election.
In an interview with the PA News agency yesterday, Mr Blair said: ''It
has always been accepted that the purpose of this change was to increase
radically the number of women MPs, which is right because women are
absurdly under-represented in Parliament. But it was always seen as a
one-off process and these arguments are, by and large, being settled and
we are managing to work by consent.
''It has given us a number of very strong and very able candidates,
but the process has not been ideal at all and that is accepted by the
most vociferous supporters of the proposal.
''But the outcome on the whole has been extremely good, with
highly-talented and able women standing as candidates for the Labour
Party. We will have increased radically the number of women standing and
we will have made the quantum leap that we wanted to make.''
However, prominent women's rights campaigner Ms Johann Lamont, a
former chairwoman of the Scottish Labour Party, said she was
''flabbergasted'' by the news.
''I will be very surprised and disappointed if the party agrees to
this,'' she said. ''The party is committed to equal representation of
men and women in the House of Commons by the turn of the century and we
cannot do that without all-women shortlists.
''This mechanism guarantees increased representation and it was always
understood that it would continue. It cannot just be a one-off.''
Asked if she thought the move would meet resistance in Scotland, she
said: ''Absolutely, yes. The party has recognised that it needs a
constitutional mechanism to deliver equal representation because the
voluntary approach has never worked. I thought everybody understood the
reason for the mechanism, and the Blair leadership made a big thing of
supporting equal representation.''
However, Mrs Irene Adams, MP for Paisley North, said she had never
been completely in favour of all-female shortlists.
''There is no doubt that we do not have enough women in Parliament but
instead of having some shortlists with all women, I would have liked to
see every shortlist with equal numbers of men and women. I hope we will
see that in the future.''
Other points covered by Mr Blair in yesterday's interview included the
balance between unions and constituency parties in voting at Labour
conferences. He backed a rapid shift to a 50-50 balance and hinted at
further changes ahead.
The party's national executive committee is today expected to endorse
a plan to make the switch away from the current 70-30 weighting in
favour of the unions at the October conference in Brighton, in time for
next year.
There had been a widespread expectation that the change, triggered by
rapidly increasing party membership, would be phased in, but that plan
has now been dropped.
''There were people saying that was not going to happen for a long
period of time, but the party has again shown it is willing to move on
change very quickly,'' said Mr Blair.
''The trade union vote represents the voices of several million trade
union levy payers, and we are trying to bring these people into the
Labour Party as full members. I don't know where this process of change
will now go, but you can see the dynamic that is at work.''
Ms Anne Middleton, depute Scottish secretary of Unison, the country's
biggest union, said: ''Two or three years back there was an agreement
with all the trade unions that once Labour Party membership reached a
certain level, that would be a trigger for the 50-50 arrangement.
''We welcome what is seen as the final amendment to the constitution
of the Labour Party, because it shows that the membership has increased
substantially because Labour's policies are the way forward.
''We look forward to working with the Labour Party and working towards
a General Election which is going to be a success for them.''

SCATTERED along lengths of silk, chiffon and satin are whimsical pen
and ink drawings of Harriet Anstruther's heroines. Illustrations of Lady
Diana Cooper, Mrs Reginald Fellowes, and Frieda Dudley Ward, those icons
of style between the First and Second World Wars, are just a few of the
faces posing on her long scarves as if waiting for Cecil Beaton's camera
to record the moment for posterity.
Harriet Anstruther is first and foremost a talented illustrator,
except her sketchpad is not of paper, but lengths of luxurious fabrics
which ultimately end up swathing the necklines of many modern beauties.
The Princess of Wales, Tilda Swinton, Barbra Streisand and Miranda
Richardson have a penchant for Anstruther's ethereal drawings.
She is big on romance, history and literature. These are the sources
of her inspiration. So, too, is the splendid ancestral Scottish seat,
Balcaskie, situated between Pittenweem and Anstruther on the coast of
Fife. Her family's history in Scotland dates back to 1066 and they have
owned Balcaskie since the seventeenth century. Ralph Anstruther is the
current Laird. It is to this wild, romantic place with its landscaped
gardens that cascade down to the sea that Harriet retreats with her
family (she has a baby daughter called Celestia), or to work on her
scarf collections.
''It is incredibly passionate, it's such an inspiration,'' she
enthuses. ''I love to go to draw, paint and read in the library,
surrounded by family mementos, it's very much a home.'' The house's
rich, nostalgic atmosphere has conjured up collections based on rococo
art, romantic historical themes, and images of the eighteenth century,
through to the stylish beauties -- movie stars and socialites -- of the
early twentieth century.
Although her imagination is fired by these surroundings, Harriet
nonetheless was born in London. ''I feel deeply Scottish although I
wasn't brought up there.'' Her mother is an architect and her father a
biographer who's written about the pre-Raphaelite poet Coventry Patmore
and the explorer Dr Livingstone. (Apparently the first article he wrote
in the 1950s was published by The Herald). From an early age Harriet and
her four siblings were fiercely independent. ''I was always very
creative, I think I was difficult, wild and ambitious to do my own
thing,'' she recalls. ''I wanted to go to art school because I was
passionate about style and clothes, fashion, fabrics, and books.'' Her
unerring sense of colour also emerged early. ''I love glamour and I love
pink, in fact, some people call me Miss Pink.''
Nowadays pinks of many hues form the background to her illustrations.
Her summer collection includes organza and chiffon stoles in a tangy
pink shot with orange, a powder blue, opal, pistachio, and pale
complexion colours, alternatively there are glamorous satin oblongs
sometimes faced with chiffon. On to this her pen and ink drawings are
screen printed in black, navy or a sepia monoprint.
The effect is intentionally two-dimensional, because rather than
texture -- favoured by many other scarf designers -- the drawings are
the distinctive feature of Anstruther's scarves. The collection exists
purely because: ''I wanted to marry my drawing skills with my fervour
for fashion.''
At no point had she proved she was cut out to be a businesswoman, but
she used the profits from an early business producing printed T-shirts
to sell in the King's Road to launch her scarf collection in 1990. The
cottage industry route to success was not for her, she is commercially
ambitious.
Today, she has 250 stockists around the world, including Barney's in
New York and Japan, Joyce in Hong Kong, and House of Fraser, selling her
scarves, priced from #40 to #250. She has also produced designs for
Perry Ellis, Yves St Laurent, the Royal Academy, and is currently
collaborating with a top Italian designer. She also has a partnership
with bag designer Lulu Guinness and fashion designer Selina Blow, in a
new shop in Belgravia. Whimsically romantic her drawings may be, but
Anstruther is a shrewd businesswoman.

UNLIKE David Ross (Weekender, July 22) I simply do not believe that
Charles Edward Stewart ever made a ''decision to bring on the Highland
people the greatest of calamities . . . ''
Insofar as this calamity was the product of a conscious decision, it
was a decision taken by the rulers of the British state so that they
might maintain their rule over that state.
As for Charles Edward, his failure to anticipate the sheer barbaric
brutality of his cousins in defence of their position may have been
naive, but was hardly criminal.
Which brings me to the rubbish written by George Rosie while Hunting
The Deer, instead of Chasing the thing. Mr Rosie writes that the Prince
died ''farting and belching'' and goes on to say: ''Nobody recalls the
six bottles of heavy Cyprus wine he sank every day.''
While resisting the temptation to comment on Mr Rosie's
self-evaluation, I would suggest that if he himself neither farts nor
belches then he should consult a doctor as he is very probably seriously
unwell. As for Charles and the bevvy, he drank a hell of a lot less than
Duncan Forbes of Culloden.
I have not overlooked the ''brutal rape of his young (if unpleasant)
wife Louise''. Rape is inexcusable, and the alleged unpleasantness of
the victim does not constitute mitigation; so I am at a loss to
understand why Mr Rosie chooses to assail her character in such a
context.
There is no disputing the disastrous decline of Charles Edward into a
pathetic ruin during the last four decades of his life. However, a
little human sympathy should help us achieve some understanding of why
it happened.
At the age of 25 (he was no adolescent when, if, he kissed the hand of
Flora Macdonald) his life was over. History had passed him by and the
world had no further use for him. He could not cope and turned to the
bottle.
He is not alone in that. Many a hard-headed, essentially Presbyterian,
40-year-old has done the same when replaced either by a 20-year-old
whiz-kid fresh from the university or, worse, by a machine.
The present use of Jacobitism as ''one of the Anglo-British state's
instruments of political and social control'' can hardly be laid at the
door of Charles Edward, as it was his clearly stated intention to
restore the Parliament in Edinburgh, thereby dissolving that state.
Furthermore, Mr Rosie's opinion, that tartans and bagpipes were by the
end of the eighteenth no longer regarded as accoutrements of war, is
frankly absurd. From the Plains of Abraham to the Deccan Plateau,
Highland regiments fought and died for the greater glory of the very
state that was destroying their culture. The Elder Pitt was the proud
architect of that.
Finally, what is wrong with a Falkirk estate agent or Paisley
accountant climbing into full ''Highland dress'' whenever the feels the
desire so to do?
Would it make Scotland a nicer place if we all honoured our
Presbyterian heritage and dressed in flapping black suits, complete with
dog-collars, like so many mutant carrion crows? Should we all wear
uniform blue denim, which is nothing more than French tent cloth (serge
de Nimes) turned into trousers? Or the smart black plastic bin-bag,
jauntily set off by a ring through the nose with attached rope?
Enough! I wear a kilt every day. It is hard-wearing, colourful, and
extremely comfortable, as it does not compress my testicles when I am
seated. The same cannot be said for most types of trousers currently on
sale.
However, I do not wear a black jacket with silver buttons, nor a tweed
jacket with horn buttons. Neither do I wear a lace jabot, kilt pin,
silver-mounted sporran, chequered hose, or ''gillie'' shoes. They are
not compulsory.
More especially, I do not carry a sgian dubh lest I be tempted to use
it on those people who will persist in trying to foist their
misconceived opinions upon me.
Everybody is entitled to his own opinion, but some opinions are worth
more than others; and those of Mr Rosie are not worth having at all.

FOUR people were injured yesterday, one seriously, after an
articulated lorry, a car, and a van collided on the A736 at Lochlibo
Road, Barrhead, Renfrewshire. Mr Robert Bain, 38, of Atholl Place,
Linwood, was trapped in his van for 90 minutes before being released by
firefighters using special cutting equipment. He was detained in the
Royal Alexandra Hospital, Paisley, where his condition last night was
described as serious, but stable.
His passenger and the driver of the lorry suffered minor injuries. The
car driver, Mr John Granger, 61, of Ladyhill Drive, Glasgow, was
detained in the Royal Alexandra with a back injury.

LOCATE in Scotland is promoting two sites -- one in industrial
Lanarkshire, the other on the Cowal Peninsula -- as potential homes for
a 2000-job semiconductor fabrication plant planned by German industrial
conglomerate Siemens.
In the race to land the #1000m investment, LIS has suggested site
options at Eurocentral, the freight terminal at Mossend, and the
Sandbank Business Park, overlooking the Holy Loch, near Dunoon.
Scotland faces intense competition for the project from sites in the
north-east of England and the Midlands and rival options in Germany,
Ireland and Austria. On Monday in Vienna, Siemens president Dr Heinrich
von Pierer told journalists a final decision would be made this summer,
adding that speed was of the essence.
A presentation made to Siemens by LIS and seen by The Herald suggests
the two options are only a small selection of the many available here.
But the document also betrays signs of a belated entry into the race.
It says: ''LIS would welcome the opportunity to provide a more
facility-focused presentation document once we have a more detailed
awareness of the technical aspects of the project.''
There are reports that the Prime Minister and his new deputy, Mr
Michael Heseltine, intervened personally with Dr von Pierer in London
earlier this month to persuade him to bring the Siemens project to the
UK. The LIS presentation is dated July 1995.
The Mossend site is no surprise. It was the intended location of a
major Samsung project last year which went, instead, to Teesside. But
the promotion of Sandbank as an alternative for such a major
job-intensive project is more surprising.
Although it lies in the area directly affected by the withdrawal of
the US Navy from the Holy Loch base, it is out of the mainstream stretch
of Silicon Glen. But Sandbank does lie in Highlands and Islands
Enterprise territory and its inclusion may reflect some of the past
tensions over how much LIS-sponsored inward investment ends up outwith
the central belt.
Unlike Mossend, Sandbank does not lie in an enterprise zone, with all
the financial benefits that can bring. But the Highlands have won
significant European development funding.
Although Scotland has a remarkably strong track record attracting new
semiconductor investment -- Motorola and NEC announced new projects
totalling some #800m last year alone -- successfully wooing Siemens will
be a major challenge.
Siemens is also thought to be interested, in competition with
ScottishPower, in acquiring NEL, the National Engineering Laboratory
operation at East Kilbride.
Asked about attempts to attract Siemens' semiconductor fabrication
plant, a Locate in Scotland spokeswomnan would not confirm or deny
Scottish interest. She said: ''We do not comment on individual cases.''

SOME weeks ago I suggested that the Government should mark the 250th
anniversary of the battle of Culloden by giving Inverness city status as
capital of the Highlands, and financing the proposed university of the
Highlands and Islands.
I have now had a reply from the Scottish Office. It is very courteous
and very negative. In effect it says ''no'' to city status, ''no'' to a
Highland university and ''no'' to any official commemoration of the
battle of Culloden.
City status for Inverness is ruled out because there is no legislative
provision for creating cities in Scotland although there is in England.
Scotland is different from England and must apparently remain so!
The university is ruled out because the Government has decided that,
''throughout the UK'', the ''level of new, full-time entrants to
higher-education courses in further-education colleges should be
consolidated at current levels''. So Scotland is the same as England and
apparently must remain so!
Official commemoration of the last battle fought on British soil is
ruled out by the simple expedient of not mentioning Culloden at all.
The letter appears to have been written before the advent of the new
broom at St Andrew's House. I wonder if more positive thinking now
prevails? After all, April 16, 1996, is a political and, above all, a
Unionist anniversary.
If the Scottish Secretary doesn't like my suggestions for marking the
occasion, has he any of his own?

THE Scottish Council for Civil Liberties is to be congratulated for
making its presentation to the UN (UN tackles Britain over home rule,
July 21).
However, the chairman, Mr Alan Miller, is uninformed when he says:
''It is the first time I am aware . . . that the question of Scotland's
right to self-determination has been received by the UN.''
It is in fact the third time to my knowledge that the UN has received
a claim of Scotland's right of self-determination.
In March, 1979, Scotland UN presented to the UN Scotland's Claim to
Right of Self-determination. Then in July, 1980, we presented a 100-page
document to the UN, titled Scotland's Claim of Right to
Self-determination. In both cases the UN acknowledged receipt of our
presentations.
We are a small group of dedicated people who for the past 16 years
have supported Scotland's Claim of Right to Self-determination at the
UN, the Council of Europe, and the Conference for Security and
Co-operation in Europe.
On April 9, 1993, I sent to the National Council for Civil Liberties
at its London address a complete case history of Scotland's Claim. I
offered to furnish further information but did not receive an
acknowledgement.
We welcome all support for Scotland's Claim at the UN.

THE mishandling of the announcement of the #3m award to the National
Galleries of Scotland for the acquisition of 12 surrealist artworks from
the Penrose collection was inexcusable, but sadly predictable. Ignoring
the sensibilities of the recipients of the grant, the National Heritage
Memorial Fund chose to reveal details of its largesse to a London-based
newspaper ahead of its own embargo for the release of the news. The
impression is given of a couldn't-care-less attitude towards the
institutions of Scotland even as one is benefiting to such a handsome
degree. The National Galleries themselves were dismayed, but impotent to
complain for fear of appearing churlish and ungrateful. Such is the
power of the National Lottery.
There is a perception abroad that membership of one of the committees
which distributes the proceeds of the lottery is power without
responsibility. This may be unfair to the members of the committees who
are doing their best to distribute cash that has come flooding into the
coffers at an undreamed-of rate. Lord Rothschild's acknowledgment that
the mechanisms of distribution will be changed next year is implicitly a
recognition of the deficiencies of the current system. But the public
can be excused the belief that the proceeds of their weekly flutter is
being frittered away on fripperies. The acquisition of the Churchill
papers for a nation that believed -- if it cared -- that it owned them
anyway, and the granting of #55m to renovate the Royal Opera House have
done untold damage not only to the reputation of the National Lottery
but to the perception of arts and culture.
Perhaps cash-starved arts organisations were quick to see the
opportunities afforded by the lottery and should be applauded for their
enterprise. But against a background where charities are feeling the
effects of the public's investment in lottery tickets, there is disquiet
about which charities will be allowed to benefit, and with the
distribution of funds to charities lagging well behind that for other
''good causes'', the damage has already been done. The lottery will
probably be John Major's lasting memorial, he should act now to save it
from becoming tarnished.

AS Parliament goes into summer recess, the MP for Monklands West, Tom
Clarke, has still failed to explain to a puzzled press and public why he
stated in January, 1993, that vociferous concerns expressed by various
Conservatives, including Dover MP David Shaw, regarding the situation in
Monklands were ''McCarthyite smears.''
Much more recently, at the behest of Professor Robert Black's damning
report into Monklands council, the same Mr Clarke eventually publicly
agreed, after dodging the press for several days, that he fully backed
the decision of the Labour Party nationally to suspend from membership
all the surviving members of Monklands District Council.
Perhaps Mr Clarke, like a number of other doubters, has found the
evidence of Professor Black's report overwhelmingly convincing. He has
certainly completely changed his stance, having even fallen out with
Helen Liddell's viewpoint that all was not well, at the time of the
by-election.
It may well be that Mr Clarke does not feel able to apologise to David
Shaw and others, although I invite him now to do so.
However, there is a much more serious problem for the Scottish Labour
Party -- and indeed the national Labour Party in London -- as it embarks
upon the exercise of examining the position of the Monklands
councillors.
Everyone involved with Monklands knows that a full inquiry into events
dating from the inception of the council in 1975 is essential, if the
truth is finally to be established, given that many of the existing
councillors, so severely criticised as a group by Professor Black, were
members of the original council and, indeed, members of the Coatbridge
Burgh Council prior to 1975.
The Labour Party simply must insist on Mr Clarke making a public
statement covering his view of the council during the seven-and-a-half
years of his provostship from 1975. The public require to hear from Mr
Clarke him whether or not he was aware of any of the practices
enumerated by Professor Black.
If Mr Clarke continues to dodge the issue until Parliament resumes in
October, then the matter will have to be raised again then.
Jack McConnell, who is right in the middle of the contretemps, being
Labour's senior official in Scotland, also owes two gentlemen an
apology. He it was who, in December on Words with Wark from Monklands,
publicly stated to the nation that ''Monklands council leaders are not
coming on this programme to face a 'kangaroo court' from the likes of
Gordon Lind and John Love'' (chairmen of Monklands West and East
Conservatives respectively).
He turned up that evening with only Maria Fyfe, MP for Maryhill, who
had nothing whatsoever to do with the Monklands affair.
Mr McConnell has also been forced to change his vantage point
recently, and it must have been a most painful experience for one who
had tried so desperately hard to wish that Monklands would go away and
leave him in peace.
Finally, George Robertson, he of the erstwhile opposition to local
government reform, must now be on bended knee at night in gratitude to
Ian Lang for persevering with reform, which will save the Shadow
Secretary from further torture over Monklands after next April.

Chairman, Monklands West Conservative Association,

THE Labour Party's experiment with all-women short lists for
parliamentary constituencies will end at the next General Election. This
is good news for Labour, for women, and for democracy. Nobody disputes
the need for greater numbers of women in Parliament, though to list the
qualities which women bring to modern politics would simply bring
allegations of patronising cant. The Labour Party should be
congratulated for at least having approached the issue in a serious
manner, but the mechanism chosen would, if maintained, have created many
more problems than those it sought to remedy. The most obvious problem
is that the new brand of Labour which Mr Blair seeks to develop would
have been open to charges of persisting with the sort of absolutist and
prescriptive habits which it is supposed, in the demonology of the
right, to hanker after. Mr Blair's decision will meet resistance, but it
is doubtful if the diehards represent anything like the majority of
Labour women.
To argue for strict adherence to a policy of equal representation in
the House of Commons by the turn of the century through all-women short
lists is to press for a skewing of democratic principles in a quite
unacceptable manner. That said, the experiment has had significant and
heartening results. Experiments of this sort tend to act as a catalyst,
and it is a simple fact that greater numbers of women are becoming
involved in Labour politics at least partly as a result of the impetus
given by the exploration of all-women short lists.
The evidence seems to suggest that women are also finding it easier to
be selected in constituencies where there are open short lists, and that
in itself is a good result in a party which has tended to follow
doggedly traditionalist lines in certain constituencies. This particular
method of encouraging women into politics could not, in all sense, be
continued. Yet those who scoffed should examine the composition of their
own parties and reflect on the real, as well as the theoretical,
benefits of equality.

I LIVE in Vancouver, Canada, and have just returned from a holiday in
Scotland that was saved from disaster by the thoughtfulness and honesty
of the Scottish people.
I was with my mother, who lives in England. We were celebrating her
87th birthday touring the land of her forefathers.
While returning from Armadale on the Isle of Skye to Mallaig via the
last CalMac ferry of the day my mother realised she had lost her purse
with important papers, precious photos, and about #70 in cash.
With the help of the ship's purser we retraced the day's visits to try
to find the purse, and at least the papers and photos. The purser
contacted a CalMac office which in turn called hotels and restaurants we
had visited that day. We heard before docking that nothing had been
found.
Then my mother remembered that she might have left the purse in a
public toilet at Broadford. We went to the police station at Mallaig, a
policeman called Broadford police station, and we learned that the purse
had indeed been handed in by a member of the staff at the local tourist
information office.
Everything was there, including the cash.
But there was more goodwill from the Scottish people. Realising that a
return ferry ride to Armadale and the 40-minute drive to Broadford would
use up valuable holiday time, not to mention a lot of money, the
Broadford police officer agreed to meet the first ferry in the next
morning.
I then went over as a foot passenger and received the purse on the
dock at Armadale.
I just want to say that it was wonderful the way all did their bit to
ensure that an old lady's first trip to Scotland would be a memorable
one.

As Ariel Dorfman settles in Edinburgh to oversee the production of his
new play, Mark Fisher asks what could make him think that a small
Scottish studio theatre might be the place to make his next theatrical
statement?
THE first question has to be ''Why?'' Why Edinburgh? Why the Traverse?
Why here? Why now? Why has Ariel Dorfman, Argentinean by birth, Chilean
by nationality, North American by residency, chosen to premiere his
latest play in Scotland?
What could the writer of Death and the Maiden, one of the decade's
most internationally successful plays, good enough to attract actors of
the calibre of Juliet Stevenson and Bill Paterson for its London run,
Glenn Close, Richard Dreyfuss, and Gene Hackman for its Broadway run,
and Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver for the recent Polanski-directed
movie . . . what could this writer be thinking of to up sticks and
settle in Edinburgh for six weeks to oversee the production of his new
play, Reader?
What could possibly make a 53-year-old man with homes in North
Carolina and Santiago, with a grim history as a victim of political
persecution at the merciless grip of the Pinochet regime, a man with a
formidable reputation as a novelist, poet, critic, and writer of short
stories, what could make him think that a small Scottish studio theatre,
however fearsome its artistic credentials, might be the place to make
his next theatrical statement?
The answer is that Ariel Dorfman likes being an outsider. Having left
Argentina at the age of two for the United States only to move to Chile
at 12, Dorfman knew about displacement long before he learned about
enforced exile. He was ousted from Chile in 1973 after the coup that
overthrew Salvador Allende's socialist government, and deported for a
second time in 1987 after another four-year stay.
Once in his life he yearned for a sense of belonging. Now he thinks
it's more productive to be on the edge and looking in.
''My plays are about people who are not where they should be,'' he
says when I meet him in the Traverse bar, his demeanour more like a
lucid European academic than one who has looked the ugly face of
totalitarianism in the eye.
''Edinburgh is a particularly good city to do this in. The Traverse is
on the cutting edge not only of British drama, but world drama. It's
experimental and at the same time it's very interested in telling
stories and, in Ian Brown, you've got a wonderful director.
''I wanted to work in a theatre with the freedom to experiment, where
you have wonderful actors and an excellent team -- and to see what
happens. If it becomes popular, I'm very glad, otherwise I'm happy
simply to have done it. I want to make sure the text is right, and this
is the best place to do it. I really think that you have an
extraordinary theatre community in Edinburgh and in Britain in
general.''
Reader first appeared in short-story form almost 20 years ago and was
published in this country in 1992 in Dorfman's My House is on Fire
collection. It's a deceptively simple tale about a government censor
with an unimpeachable track record for rooting out subversive material,
who finds himself uncharacteristically beguiled by a unpublished novel
that appears to feature himself as the central character. Finding
himself the subject of the novelist's vision -- in effect the novelist's
censorship -- the censor starts to make the connection between his own
small actions and the grand, crushing oppression of the state.
In its brisk 20 pages, Reader captures the unsettling edge of paranoia
that pervades a society where trust and truth have been driven away.
Like C P Taylor's Good and like Death and the Maiden itself, the story
raises nagging questions about how far we can go, how many compromises
we can make, how many moral choices we can fudge before we become as bad
as our oppressors. Dorfman proffers no answers, but it is the universal
nature of the questions that makes his work so resonant.
Dorfman's pursuit of national identity has required him to engage not
just in philosophical theory but real physical struggle, so what does he
feel about finding a voice for himself so far from home -- especially in
a place like Scotland that has problems of identity of its own? ''I
wrote Reader, the play, in English, but I wrote the original short story
in Spanish,'' he explains.
''The dilemma the Scots have about language is a dilemma of many
people around the world. It is a dilemma of the bilingual and it's a
good dilemma to be in. Rather than seeing it to our detriment, it should
be something which enriches our lives. If you have two cultures and
define where those cultures meet and where they don't, where they merge
and where they challenge each other, word by word and phrase by phrase
through the grammar and through memory, it's wonderful.''
Every night after rehearsals, Dorfman heads back to his flat to
translate Reader back into Spanish for a forthcoming Latin-American
production. The insights of one language inform his work on the other.
''For many years I tried to hide from myself the dilemmas of the
bilingual,'' he says. ''Now I have embraced them and I'll probably spend
the rest of my life exploring them. Everything in my work is about split
-- split people, split communities, split languages -- and I'm exploring
that.''
By his own admission, Dorfman's commercial success, most prominently
with Death and the Maiden, has made it that much harder for him to
maintain his cherished position as an outsider. Literary success has
pulled him to the centre of a literary circle -- and the centre is a
place he is instinctively wary of. In part it explains his decision to
open Reader in Edinburgh, to place the emphasis on the art not the
artist. Success has come to him late enough in life to be able to tackle
it with some maturity. He's glad that it's allowed him the chance to
write a BBC screenplay, but he's not too starry-eyed to say no to three
offers from Hollywood.
''It's good to be outside as long as you're on the edge of outside,''
he says.
''You can be too far outside, where what you're saying is
comprehensible only to yourself. That ends up being the place of
madness. Although artists are very akin to the insane, the fact that
they deal with a communal language, a language that is supposed to be
understood by others, is very important. You write from the outside and
if you're successful they drag you inside. What you must do then is step
outside the circle again. Most people when they're inside they stay
inside and go deeper. I feel comfortable outside. Outside there is
freedom. Centres worry me because you can't see the centre from the
centre.''
Despite this distant perspective, Reader like most of Dorfman's work
is about the search for identity and about the ways in which people can
become closer. It is themes of this kind, rather than the experiences of
vicious state oppression, with which Dorfman is most profoundly
concerned and which makes his work so widely understood. ''I have seen
and I have lived with the fact of the torture and the death of my
friends, of my own personal exile, of censorship being applied to me,''
he says.
''It is not something which is theoretical. On the other hand all my
work is a meditation on the connection between those experiences and the
experiences of other people. I don't want it to be an exotic
experience.''
There is a short run of previews of Reader from July 28 to August 3.
Its run proper is on the Edinburgh Fringe for three weeks from August
15.

IT IS, of course, the time of year when it seems obligatory to
scrabble around travel shops for a cheap holiday to a cheap resort.
Having booked a sub-standard hotel in a dubious resort it is
understandable to be left with a nagging suspicion that as with every
other damn thing in life you get what you pay for.
This fear may have been bolstered by the recent spontaneous combustion
of exotically named, crumbling airlines taxiing along Glasgow airport's
runway. The Bulgarian aviation authorities at Varna -- that, yes, cheap
holiday resort much favoured by Glaswegians -- have at least been
upfront about cost cutting. They have, as the new arrivals sign below
illustrates, simply dispensed with the runway and simplified landing
procedures. Don't start whingeing about compensation. You have been
warned.
Bible-basher
IT couldn't be avoided. The subject of Bibles creeps into the Diary
again. After reports that the World Bible Publishers in Iowa had
produced a modern American translation of the Good Book in US-speak for
easy consumption by the public, the Wishaw Press reveals that the
traditional version has been all too well understood by the weary
neighbours of a Jean Murray from Wishaw.
Ms Murray, sister of country singer Sydney Divine, has found herself
at the sharp end of a petition lodged with Motherwell District Council.
It calls for her eviction on the grounds of ''quoting the Bible at her
neighbours''.
Gaelic spoke
proper, ken?
GOOD NEWS, though, for Dr Iain Murray of Dundee University's
MicroCentre, and frankly the world, when a desperate, Scotland-wide plea
for a fluent Gaelic speaker elicited around 20 responses, including one
suitable candidate.
Dr Murray's well-reported problem was that his awfully clever
prototype computer could only speak Gaelic with an English accent and so
was mispronouncing 30% of its words.
His relief at finding a speaker from the Highlands presumably comes
from having saved his computer from speaking the lilting language of the
isles in a Dundonian accent and so mispronouncing 100% of its words.
Keep on tight leash
IT had until the weekend remained one of those trivial yet perplexing
mysteries. Just how sane are the faceless people whose lives are
dedicated to the invention of endearing yet useless ''handy'' devices
which fill the pages of those Innovations catalogues surreptitiously
sandwiched inside Sunday newspaper lifestyle sections.
The answer came in the shape of a pamphleteer pestering drinkers in an
Edinburgh bar. Mr John Greenshields of Uphall in West Lothian has
invented a Doggy Bag to strap on to a fouling canine and, as he
delicately puts it, ''let the dog do its job in a given time''.
His invention, he claims, can protect the environment, cut crime, and
prevent disease. Revealing what catalogue readers probably suspected,
that inventors are an eccentric lot, Mr Greenshields declared: ''My dog
Lucky and I have climbed Everest, yet no-one seems to notice.'' Wonder
why.
Beanofeast
FROM the normally dull world of education comes a smasher of a read.
Those toffs at Kingfisher, an offshoot of Larousse and publishers of
worthy reference books and dictionaries, have put together The Beano
Book of Amazing Facts. The Beano characters cavort through the Beanotown
Museum encountering the sort of amazing things usually of interest to
boffins and swots.
The only inaccuracy is in the advertising blurb which suggests that
this jazzy publication would suit children aged between seven and 10
years old. Who are they kidding? This is of course for the parents of
children who missed computer games by a whisker and remember relating to
stories about a child cursed with an unfashionable name, a stripy jumper
and Magic-marker hair.
Policeman's lot
IN an attempt to foster good relations between the community and the
police the Times Educational Supplement Scotland tells its readers of a
primary teacher in Easterhouse who set her weans the task of writing an
essay on what they thought of the polis.
Back came one concise effort. ''The police is bastards.'' Alarmed, the
teacher invited the local police to give a talk on crime prevention
before asking her class to pen their opinions on the human face of
modern policing. The same wee scribe was not fooled, ''The police is
cunning bastards.''
Grudge match
THE last word on the Open for anyone still interested. A Scottish
golfing picture branded a forgery by a London art magazine editor and
withdrawn from a Sotheby's sale a year ago was back on view at St
Andrews during the Open.
Far from being a forgery the picture of ''Golfers on Glasgow Green'',
painted in about 1830, has been given a clean bill of health.
Its owner, US golfing memorabilia expert Mort Olman, tells the Diary
he has had a number of interested parties look at the painting. He has
partly forgiven Sotheby's for apparently taking the word of magazine art
critic Robin Simon who first made the outlandish forgery claim at a
cocktail party. But Olman has not forgiven Simon. ''The worst goddam son
of a bitch I have had to deal with in 58 years of business,'' growled
Olman.
Simon says Olman is ''a vile man, an idiot''.
No meeting of minds there. Yours for #130,000.
Bit of a dive? Holiday bargain-hunters are greeted with this
reassuring sign after they arrive at Varna in Bulgaria.

<TEXT>
A GROUP of MPs called yesterday for measures to combat the growing
menace of organised crime -- particularly the threat posed by gangsters
from Eastern Europe.
The Home Affairs Select Committee highlighted how gangs from the
former Soviet Union and other former Eastern Bloc countries had made
inroads in recent years into drug trafficking, car crime, illegal
immigration rackets, and organised prostitution.
The MPs warned Britain's banking sector provided an attractive target
for the new gangsters looking to ''launder'' the proceeds of their
crimes.
Principle among the committee's recommendations to the Government for
new counter-measures was reform of the regional crime squads.
It said police efforts against organised crime would be more effective
if the system of separate squads were to be replaced by a nationally
co-ordinated structure. It also called for:
* More freedom to undertake surveillance operations against suspected
criminals for the National Criminal Intelligence Service;
* The Department of Trade and Industry to look urgently at company law
to counteract money laundering;
* Greater cooperation between the police and customs.
The committee found little evidence of organised criminal gangs from
the former Eastern Bloc operating directly in or from the UK, but warned
of the need for effective pre-emptive measures.
To that end, the committee called on the Government to resist efforts
by other EU countries to bring Britain within an open frontier zone,
allowing EU citizens to pass between states without identity checks.

In Madrid
SPANISH police were yesterday hunting a Briton known as Big John after
a Glasgow man died and three other Britons were gunned down in
Fuengirola.
The drug-related shooting happened at the British-owned pub the Happy
Wanderer on Sunday evening.
Scot Gerald McDonald, 34, was fatally wounded and died a few hours
later in hospital at Mijas. His girlfriend Christine Phillips, 37, from
Cannock, Staffordshire, was shot in the back and shoulder.
Pub owners Brian Greatorex, 46, from Watford, and David Williams, 28,
of Birmingham, were also wounded. The three are in stable condition in
hospital in Marbella.
Big John is described by police as burly with greying hair and a
moustache, aged about 50. Witnesses said he ran from the pub and
escaped.
A police spokesman said: ''He has gone to ground but we are watching
all exit points from the Costa del Sol.''
Detectives insist that the shooting was a gangland affair related to a
power struggle over control of the smuggling of hashish to Britain.

MY, how the twentieth century neuroses pile up. The latest is the
instant win or instant sin fix. The Labour Party is currently concerned
for citizens who are smitten with the National Lottery's scratchcards.
Labour is apparently seriously worried that the more vulnerable elements
of society (that's poor folk to you and me) are becoming ''addicted'' to
the little cardboard tickets, with their tantalising promise of easy,
instant riches.
It's all gambling in another guise and Scratchcard Addiction can now
become a fully fledged complaint, with its own support group and
self-help mantra -- ''Believe in yourself, pass that newsagent's shop,
just walk on by.'' Soon it will be a medically recognised affliction, a
legitimate excuse for time off work, spot of shoplifting, or spousal
abuse.
It can join Fitness Fanaticism, Computer Games Compulsion, Habitat
Hoarders (particularly vile), and Internet Insanity. All terrifying
problems, to be sure. But spare a thought for the neglected victims of
Phone Psychosis, a horrific disease which means that whenever you pick
up a telephone you hold on to it with such urgent longing that it
practically has to be prised from your grasp before you can put down the
receiver.
Sure, it's fun at first. That heady high of chattering away night and
day, ascending into another plane, reaching out and metaphorically
touching someone via the telecommunication network. Oh, the buzz, the
thrill! I get tingly just thinking about it. But soon it's not enough to
snatch a moment of ecstasy now and then. Soon you have to sustain it for
hours at a time, feverishly flicking through your address book to find
companions in crime who are happy to freebase on the phone till dawn.
Then, suddenly, it's no longer fun, a harmless habit. You're in the
grip of a psychotic compulsion, unable to walk down a high street past
the tempting spectre of a phone booth. You're breaking into a cold sweat
and out of your stride, seeking relief in the phone box, slamming the
door behind you and slamming coins into the slot, phoning someone,
anyone, even your own answering machine. Standing in stations, awaiting
a train, you're nervously eyeing up the payphone on the platform, making
reckless calculations about the possibility of fitting a quick call in
before the train pulls out.
Office work becomes a precarious juggling act of balancing official
calls with personal ones. You kid yourself on that your ''hobby'' is
about advancing your social network, about keeping in touch with pals,
but as you become gripped by it your own grip on social etiquette
becomes precarious in the extreme. In friends' homes you nonchalantly
ask if you can make a quick call, and before you know it you're
interrupting dinner parties to have a 20-minute conversation on someone
else's phone. Obviously this does not make you popular so you seek the
company of those similarly afflicted.
Thus, my closest friends are all phone fiends. I think nothing of them
disappearing into my bedroom clutching my phone when they come round to
visit, only becoming a bit anxious when I start to get the urge myself.
They are similarly tolerant of my compulsion.
Other people don't understand. A group of post-pub friends recently
looked on in amazement when I was completely unruffled by the fact that
a mate who had disappeared with my phone had been calling his girlfriend
in London for almost an hour. ''Well, at least it's not an international
call,'' I shrugged, adding hastily, ''not that I'd mind if it was.''
It's not that I'm a mug or filthy rich, it's just that I'd do the same
thing, given half the chance.
My problem is, like any self-respecting psychotic, I don't see that
it's a problem. But, having recently coughed up, nay choked, wheezed,
and spluttered up, the best part of a grand for my quarterly phone bill,
I'm prepared to admit that there could be room for improvement. Perhaps,
just perhaps, I should conquer this habit before I have to mortgage my
soul to British Telecom and resort to mugging old folk on pension days
and selling my children, or rather, other people's children, to feed my
fix.
I discussed the predicament with a friend last night. At length. She
lives in Moscow. The cost of that single call could probably pay for a
hypnotherapy session for us both. We debated the possibility of taking
up letter writing. We considered it quite seriously, weighing up its
advantages -- it's nice to get personal post -- with the disadvantages
-- too time consuming. We dismissed it as an option and spent a further
20 minutes talking costly scribble.
I reckon I'm beyond redemption. As far as I know there is no cure; I
don't think the Betty Ford Clinic is brave enough even to try weaning
addicts off Phone Psychosis. I'll just have to come to terms with the
fact that I can simultaneously cynically sneer at Bob Hoskins's cheery
invocation to talk, talk, talk, while at the same time gullibly falling
for the spend, spend, spend message.
Now the radio news has just announced that British Telecom has been
given carte blanche to put its prices up. 'Scuse me. I'll have to phone
my mate to moan about it. Now, what is the code for Sydney?

I HAVE never understood the logic of creating and nurturing parks in
the heart of a city, and then building roads through them. It is absurd,
like designing a beautiful swimming pool and then urinating in it.
Hence I was not among those who welcomed the coming of the Burrell
collection to Pollok Country Park. I was not in the happy throng
enthusing over this bold fusion of art and nature. I was a disconsolate
wee figure at the back, fearing what it would bring.
It did not take long. Even before the gallery was completed, car parks
were being built, paths were being covered with asphalt, one-way systems
were being planned. Then they came roaring in -- the cars, the buses,
the camper vans, the motor cycles, hundreds of them destroying the
tranquillity of the woods and polluting the air with noxious fumes.
Of a sudden, the illusion of being in the countryside was shattered;
birdsong was silenced by growling engines; it was no longer ''look at
the butterflies'', it was ''look out for the car''. The largest public
park in Glasgow, a sanctuary of pastoral serenity since the thirteenth
century, fell to the concerted assault of the infernal combustion engine
with scarcely a murmur of protest.
I felt the loss particularly keenly. As a member of a local running
club, I had been allowed to jog through the park's leafy glades long
before Mrs Anne Maxwell Macdonald gifted the estate to the city in 1966.
It was a blissful experience, far from the madding traffic's ignoble
strife outside its gates. In those days you could hear rain whispering
through the trees, fill your lungs with the intoxicating scents of
spring blossoms, and occasionally glimpse a shy roe deer, without being
continually disturbed and threatened by cars.
Sir John Stirling Maxwell, the 10th Baronet, vigorously defended his
rural retreat. During the last war, he complained repeatedly about the
number of American military vehicles speeding through the grounds. I
suspect the old man would be birling in his grave if he knew how the
city council has allowed his estate to be inundated by traffic.
This is an essential point that appears to have been missed in the
euphoria over the Burrell collection, that curious mish-mash of relics
accumulated at random by a millionaire magpie (personally, I do not
believe that anything in the gallery matches the vibrant natural beauty
of the trees outside its windows, but I suppose that is a minority
view).
Whatever the engineers may design, or the publicists may say, cars
remain noisy, dirty, and dangerous. They make a mess of our lungs, and
sometimes of our entire bodies. It is certifiable lunacy to allow them
to invade a dear green place which should be reserved for poets and
lovers, and kids playing on swings and flying kites, and dogs chasing
sticks, and grannies admiring the rhododendrons, and so on.
It is also unnecessary. At the north-east perimeter, where vehicles at
present exit on to Haggs Road, there are a number of playing fields. Any
of them could provide parking for cars and buses that could enter and
leave at this point, and be prohibited elsewhere in the park.
In return, the present car park opposite the Burrell Gallery could
revert to recreational use (it was originally a pony field), as could
another adjacent to Pollok House (an erstwhile croquet pitch). For the
elderly and infirm, electric carts or buggies could provide transport to
the main attractions; families might enjoy being taken around in a horse
and cart; the rest of us might consider reverting to what comes
naturally in country parks -- walking.
Then perhaps we might see the deer again -- there are said to be four
or five of them still sheltering in the quieter parts of the park. And
maybe we could have the swings back -- the ones in the big field that
were inexplicably removed when the Burrell stuff came.
There are employees of the parks department in Pollok who share this
view. Unfortunately, such grass-roots concerns do not appear in a #78m
development plan, entitled ''Glasgow Parks and Open Spaces Strategy'',
approved by the city council last month. Amid all the usual verbose guff
about ''key issues'' and ''vision statements'', the document reaffirms
that parks provide an important green lung for the city's residents. The
irony of polluting the green lung at Pollok with vehicle exhaust fumes
seems to have escaped the report's authors.
Nevertheless, they propose to spend huge sums on city parks to promote
the general health, wellbeing, and environmental awareness of the
populace. They could start by demonstrating some environmental awareness
of their own, and improving the health and wellbeing of the rest of us,
by getting the cars and buses out of Pollok Country Park. And bringing
back the swings, please.

YOUR report by Bruce McKain concerning six-year-old Bradley
demonstrates the terrible consequences of using the adversarial legal
process for family disputes (July 14).
Instead of the state intervening to minimise the difficulties for
helpless Bradley by counselling his separated parents to co-operate in a
civilised way to rear their child, sheriffs and judges threw the two
parents into an arena to fight it out.
For four years Sheriff Andrew Lothian and Sheriff Principal Gordon
Nicholson have encouraged this obscene and pagan spectacle with
devastating consequences for the child whom they have deprived of a
devoted and dedicated father.
The mental cruelty to the child and father is worse than extreme
physical violence.
What young Bradley needs above all else is for his parents to be
counselled by carers who can reduce hostilities between his mum and dad
-- Shoneagh McManus and Stuart Sanderson. This requires not only natural
ability but also comprehensive training. Only impartial people with
compassion and integrity are suitable for this crucial social work.
Our new Secretary of State for Scotland should immediately intervene
in this disgraceful judgment by Lord Weir and Lord Brand.
Our elected representatives have a duty to make sure that the Children
(Scotland) Bill will end the revolting practice of encouraging separated
parents to fight for possession of their child and terminate the awesome
power of the judiciary in family disputes.
Every child has a sacred right to be loved, cared for, protected, and
nurtured by both his/her real parents who are imbued by nature for this
immense task.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has appointed Sunday Times
columnist Gerald Warner as special adviser at the Scottish Office.
Mr Warner, 50, is an unashamed right-winger. His appointment to such a
key role at the Scottish Office will astonish many people after the
strenuous efforts Mr Forsyth has made, since being appointed Scottish
Secretary, to portray himself as a listening Minister and to shake off
his old partisan right-wing image.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said the choice of Mr
Warner ''simply beggared belief''.
''It completely gives the lie to claims that Michael Forsyth has
learned from his past failures. When he was Scottish Party chairman, he
stuffed the Scottish Conservative headquarters with his own right-wing
hatchet men. Now he is making exactly the same mistake by appointing
Gerald Warner.''
Mr Warner recently wrote that Mr Forsyth's pugnacity, intellect, and
experience far outmatched that of Mr Robertson. He also said Mr Forsyth
had made mistakes but there were grounds for believing he was a reformed
character.
The new adviser has strong views about Scottish journalists whom he
recently described in print as ''whingers with laptops''.
Mr Warner has also claimed the condition of the Scottish media is
terminally bigoted.
A former pupil of St Aloysius College and graduate of Glasgow
University, he has worked as a writer and broadcaster since the mid
1970s, latterly with the Sunday Times Scotland.
The special adviser's role is a curious one and he or she operates in
a grey area between civil service and party politics.
Attempting to explain it, St Andrews House said a special adviser was
a temporary civil servant who, with the Minister's approval, was allowed
to take part in certain political activities such as party functions and
making contact with party members.
The job, which is thought to pay #40,000 a year, tends to be the
preserve of bright young graduates who take it on for a few years before
moving on, possibly to fight a Parliamentary seat.
Mr Warner, however, stood as a Conservative candidate in the 1970s and
was secretary of the party's Scottish advisory committee on education.
Mr Forsyth said he wanted to appoint a special adviser who would be
prepared to support the whole Ministerial team. ''Gerald Warner's
talents as a journalist and his knowledge of Scottish affairs will be of
great help.''
Although there have usually been two advisers, Mr Forsyth said he was
not planning to make a further appointment at this stage.

I OFTEN thought of Scotland when, at a certain stage of my chequered
career, I spent six months working for the Christian Democratic Party in
Italy. I was on the staff of one of the MPs representing the province of
Vicenza, not far from Venice. My boss of that period has long since
bitten the dust amid the political upheavals in his country, and quite
right too, I have to say. He could waffle windily for hours about
Catholic social philosophy, without ever enabling me to get the hang of
it. It seemed, in any case, of little practical relevance to what he
actually did, which was to wheedle for hand-outs and bend the law to
obtain and spend them. ''Sono putane'' was his favourite comment on his
constituents: ''They are whores''.
The Italian Republic was an interesting specimen because it ought to
have produced just what trendy reformers desire for this country --
ought to have, because it relied on all their recommended mechanisms,
sovereignty vested in the people, a written constitution, proportional
representation, and the like. The trouble was that it had little to do
with democracy. Whatever the formalities, the system was steadily
diverted to the self-serving purpose of the political elite, and
corrupted by that.
For a long time the people just looked on, growing cynical and
disaffected. In the end they resorted to using the ultimate deterrent of
overthrowing the system.
I never believed that could happen, though I rejoiced when it did. One
day in our constituency office, I took a look at a huge wall chart
showing the votes cast in the province of Vicenza at the last General
Election, set out by commune, the basic Italian electoral unit. In a
multi-party system you might have expected to see in each one an outcome
bearing some resemblance to the overall result. At one extreme the
Christian Democrats might get 60% in certain communes and, at the
opposite extreme, might get 20% in others. But in most their share would
not vary all that much from the 40% they won in the whole province.
In fact the pattern was quite different. In the communes they
dominated, the Christian Democrats got 90% of the vote. Similarly, in
the communes dominated by communists, they got 90%, and the same down
the line for the socialists, Liberals, Republicans. Their dominance of
their own communes was just as absolute, but they could not control as
many communes as the big parties.
What happened was that Italians did not cast their votes according to
their political opinions. It never seemed to bother them, perhaps
because they did not have many political opinions. Instead, they cast
their votes to please some local party godfather, to affirm his status
and stake his claim to a share of the hand-outs that were going . In
distributing them, the Italian state recognised no rigid distinction
between Government and opposition, but only calculated which interests
had to be squared and which could be ignored.
That was the system which Italians called ''clientelismo''. That was
what reminded me of Scotland, and above all the West of Scotland. Here
too the godfathers have perfected the techniques of corralling the vote,
through cheap rents, allocation of housing, jobs in the public sector,
capital investments favouring this place or that, calling in the aid of
central government and its many agencies on any pretext they can think
up.
It would be easy to blame Labour for all this, and usually I do, but
just for once I shall forebear. This sort of closed corporatism seems to
me to be a general fault of Scottish public life, and to have been so
for a long time, right back to the days of Henry Dundas in the
eighteenth century. You see it not only in the dominant party but at all
levels of central and local government, administration, and business,
and in the cosy relationships each establishes with the others. It works
in its way, and often achieves its own purposes, though sometimes it is
also corrupt. In any case, like the unreformed Italian Republic, it has
little to do with democracy even while it preserves the outward
democratic forms.
Some will say that I am setting out the perfect case for busting the
system open with a Scottish Parliament, as proposed by the
Constitutional Convention -- except, however, that the convention is
itself a closed corporation, not elected, as the Scottish National Party
at least had the honesty to demand, but self-appointed and so prey to
all the faddisms of special interest groups. The result has been
predictable.
Whatever else changes, the clientelismo will not. There will still be
a bloated block grant from London, ready to distribute in hand-outs.
Labour is even yet manoeuvring to maximise its chance of a majority of
seats on a minority of votes. We shall all be delivered bound and gagged
into the hands of the godfathers.
Is there any other way of busting open the system? Well, we do have
Michael Forsyth. If I have ever understood anything about him, it is his
loathing of such systems. And he has made a start this week, with the
initiative for a task force to look at the rules governing the conduct
of councillors. This does not seem to have been a welcome initiative to
the leaders of our local authorities, another closed corporation
suspiciously intent on preserving a goodly share of the benefits from
the current reforms for its existing members. But once a start has been
made we can hope for more, even with the limited time and room for
manoeuvre available.
At least there is now at the heart of the system a man who wants to
change it, which is rather more than the opposition parties can offer.

JACK McLean, aka Kirsty, writes that Christian is a boy's name (July
21). Not so, Jack -- sorry, I mean Kirsty. Christian was a very popular
quine's name in North-east Scotland especially in the nineteenth
century.
While its popularity may have declined somewhat now, I know of one
present-day person named Christian who says she would be delighted to be
stood a double whisky by way of an apology for suggesting she has a
loon's name.
Incidentally, both my mother and great-grandmother were named
Christian.

IT is a tale of tall ships and missing millions. The Decommissioning
Debacle -- money that is not coming to a fisherman or boatbuilder near
you. This is the story of the Government's decommissioning scheme for
fishing vessels -- a mix of missed opportunities, wasted years, and
stubborn refusal to accept reality.
At its best, decommissioning is a policy which allows a country better
to match catching capacity to available fish stocks and allows a
dignified exit from the industry for fishermen and hopefully also for
fishing crews. On top of this, decommissioning contributes to safety by
taking older vessels out of the fleet.
At its worst, and that means the UK, it is a tangle of difficult and
damaging regulations which have helped turn the Scottish fishing fleet
from one of the most modern in the European Union to one of the oldest,
and has facilitated the near demise of our indigenous boat-building
industry. The British Boatbuilders Association, which had a membership
of 19 Scottish yards as recently as 1987, now has only two Scottish
members still building fishing boats.
The rather unusual surroundings of the recent tall ships festival in
Leith provide an excellent example of one of the most ludicrous
restrictions within the existing decommissioning scheme.
While over one million visitors were enjoying the spectacle,
Scotland's boat builders were pointing in disbelief at the star of the
show -- a vessel which, if the UK Government had its way, would not
exist.
The Jean de la Lune -- a Leith-based brigantine -- was given the
honour of leading the prestigious parade of sail at the festival. But
this Scottish boat, a converted French fishing vessel, would never have
been built under the UK's decommissioning rules. In Britain a
decommissioned vessel is good for only two things -- the scrap yard and
the torch.
Throughout Europe fishing boats can be converted into pleasure
cruisers, tall ships, floating restaurants -- you name it. But not in
the UK, and as a result of this mindboggling restriction, Scotland's
boat-building industry misses out on thousands of pounds of conversion
business and key skills are lost. The flip side is that clubs or youth
groups miss out on the opportunity of owning a reasonably priced
pleasure boat.
Is there any justification for this unique UK rule? Is there
widespread paranoia within the Ministry of Agriculture that the Jean de
la Lune will drop nets at the first opportunity? Surely it is not beyond
competence to distinguish between a tall ship with sails and a working
trawler.
Even this farce has a twist in the tail. You and I, the Scottish
taxpayers, are actually paying European competitors to do what our own
boat builders are prevented from doing.
Winnie Ewing has been a magnificent advocate for Scotland's fishing
interests in Europe, and recently she has come up trumps in exposing
millions of pounds of missing decommissioning money for Scotland's
fishermen.
Between 1987 and 1993 the UK came a poor ninth in the Euro league
table for funding given to construct, modernise or decommission fishing
vessels. Only those well-known fishing nations, Belgium and Luxemburg,
fared worse.
Most important was the position of Spain. The nation which poses the
greatest threat to our fishing industry -- already given access rights
to Scottish waters, against the wording of its own Treaty of Accession,
by a weak-willed UK Government -- has been boosted by 10 times the level
of funding offered to the beleaguered British fleets.
UK decommissioning non-policy has allowed our fleet to stagnate. Our
rivals have steamed ahead, using money which should have been available
to Scottish fishermen, to leave our fleet struggling in their wake.
The Scottish industry is paying the price for the days-at-sea fiasco
and John Selwyn Gummer's injured pride following the disastrous
decommissioning scheme of the early 1980s. Attacked by a Commons
committee for allowing millions of pounds to disappear up the Humber,
the man who responded to the challenge of mad cow disease by parading
his young daughter eating a hamburger resorted to saying ''no'' to every
sensible fishing initiative thereafter.
What the Scottish fleet and boat-building industry are crying out for
is a comprehensive scrap-and-build policy, to make up for the wasted
years of the late eighties and early nineties. Where the Government
failed to invest in the past, it is now vital that it allows a massive
cash injection to lift the industry off the bottom.
Only the United Kingdom is failing its fishermen in this way. The
Government has often pledged that it will not allow our fishermen to be
disadvantaged in Europe, but on this key aspect of fishing policy,
Scottish fishermen are losing out at every turn -- making a mockery of
ministerial pledges.
Even the most blinkered Euro-sceptic cannot blame Europe for this
peculiarly British failing. Once again nations which have
fishing-friendly governments are taking full advantage of European
rules, while Britain leaves its fleet hamstrung and keel-hauled.
It is a politician of stature who can admit to past mistakes, and
while I do not place much hope in a reversal from the new Scottish
Office junior, the new Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is duty
bound to take a close look at the problems in the harbours and boat
yards, and seriously examine the consequences of present policy.
Perhaps a bell will ring for Mr Douglas Hogg. Then he can take the
plunge, admit past mistakes -- and go for the scrap-and-build policy so
urgently required by the industry.

THE sailing ship Carrick, record breaker, landmark, and one of the few
survivors of the golden age of sail has found its final resting place.
Now the public who may remember it from its days alongside the Clyde
in Glasgow or may have read of its exploits as a clipper between Britain
and Australia will be able to see the vessel being restored and learn
more of its colourful history.
The Carrick, which began life as the City of Adelaide in 1864 when it
was launched in Sunderland, is now at the Scottish Maritime Museum in
Irvine where, not only is it being lovingly restored to its former
glory, but is also helping young people learn rare skills associated
with an age of shipbuilding long in the past.
At a ceremony in Irvine yesterday the three first citizens of the
communities closely associated with the Carrick -- Lord Provost Tom
Dingwall of Glasgow, Councillor Allan Robertson of Inverclyde and
Councillor Stewart Dewar of Cunninghame -- gathered to launch the latest
stage in the rescue and renovation of the Carrick.
Along with the Cutty Sark, now alongside in London, the Carrick is a
survivor of the nineteenth-century era of sail and has the distinction
of holding a record of 87 days between London and Adelaide with a full
load of cargo and passengers.
A historical exhibition features the highlights of the ship's career
and a scale model illustrates how the finished article will look.
Depending on funding the entire project will take around 10 years to
complete.
Mr Jim Tildesley, director of the Scottish Maritime Museum, said:
''The Carrick has many important connections with Scotland and we are
happy that the vessel has come here and that we will be able to restore
it for people to enjoy once again.
''The project will take some time but we will be trying at all times
to allow the public maximum access to the vessel while work goes on. I
believe it will become an important centrepiece of the maritime heritage
of Scotland.''

THE Crown Office in Edinburgh is to consider fresh evidence of jury
conduct in the case of convicted murderer William Gray.
The procurator-fiscal in Airdrie received a testimony from one of the
jurors and passed it to the Crown Office yesterday. She is the third
juror to make official reports about the jury.
The Crown Office now has a range of options -- depending on the
contents of the testimony -- from passing the information to the
Secretary of State for Scotland to responding directly to the
correspondent. Because Gray's case has been to trial and appeal, only
the Scottish Secretary has the power to order a re-trial.
Gray, of Craigneuk, Airdrie, and James O'Rourke were convicted of
murdering Mr Neil Cairney and jailed for life at the High Court in
Glasgow in 1992. Gray's brother, Matthew, was jailed for six years for
assault to severe injury.
Two co-accused, brothers Stephen and Terry Donohoe, received 12-year
sentences after being found guilty of a reduced charge of culpable
homicide. Assault charges against their younger brother, James, were
dismissed. James has since admitted seeing one of the jurors but denied
he did so during the trial.
Last year, the Grays and O'Rourke had an appeal against their
convictions rejected.
Three Scottish appeal judges also dismissed allegations that during
the trial there was evidence of ''misconduct and impropriety'' by some
jurors. Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, said: ''A large part of the
statements can be described only as tittle-tattle''.
Two jurors have previously made claims about a drinking session in a
Glasgow hotel during jury deliberations and relationships between jury
members and Mr James Donohoe.
A spokesman for the Crown Office said: ''We have received a letter and
we will be considering it.''

Hamish Morrison argues that the ScottishPower takeover move should be
pursued with utmost vigour
THERE are precious few opportunities for the Scottish industrial
loyalists to support the predator in the takeover battle. We are more
accustomed to using our Scottish cards to build ring fences around
embattled local companies. Maybe the muted, slightly embarrassed public
reaction to ScottishPower's audacious move on Manweb reveals a lack of
experience in playing outside our own half. Craig Brown can be quite
eloquent on this phenomenon.
Of course right-thinking folk should not resort to lurid military and
sporting metaphors where serious matters like employment, investment,
and consumer interests are involved. Even so, it is remarkable how often
emotion triumphs over logic in industrial affairs. Corporate executives,
investment analysts, and sundry economic commentators are wont to
dismiss emotion as unworthy and irrelevant. This is a great mistake
where the public interest is at issue. The recent Brent Spar incident
illustrates the point rather graphically.
There is little doubt that ScottishPower can make a convincing
economic and technical case for combining its operations with Manweb's.
Manweb will of course use the same figures to reach a different
conclusion. These matters will be weighed carefully and in the ordinary
way the bid will succeed or fail on the judgment of Manweb's
shareholders. However, as anyone with a passing interest in public
affairs will know, the privatised utilities do not live in ordinary
circumstances.
Unlike other companies who celebrate their profitability the public
somehow expects the utilities to apologise for their profits.
In fact, ScottishPower has some claim to success in walking the fine
line between private enterprise and public service. Its commitment to
customer service at times verges on the obsessive. Scarcely a worthy
public project or good cause seems to escape the imprimatur of its
handsome logo. But how well are all these good works known in Manchester
and North Wales? Winning the hearts and minds on Brookside Close will
matter for ScottishPower.
As Scots know, regional identities can be more than a match for
industrial logic. In an industry where shareholders are obliged to share
their power with shell-shocked regulators and a beleaguered Government
the regional issues could be decisive.
So how can ScottishPower put its best foot forward in that territory
which must now become the object of its affections? In the first place
it will need the sympathy of its home support. Perhaps we should recall
the seductive pre-privatisation rhetoric which told how SSEB was going
to become a major international power company based in Glasgow. Well the
Manweb venture is a building block in that noble ambition and we Scots
cannot afford the luxury of sentimental dithering if that ambition is to
be realised.
Certainly there must be a willingness to share the fruits of the
merged venture. This should be no problem to Scots who have been
preaching the virtues of decentralisation since time out of mind.
Scottish scepticism about brass-plate head offices and relocated
divisions will be equally strong in Chester. ScottishPower must make
realistic and imaginative commitments to its new partner based on growth
and innovation.
ScottishPower's canny diversification into gas and telecoms could be
an important example of how the merged business might expand in Manweb's
area. Above all it must seek to persuade Manweb's customers of its
record in economic efficiency, technical excellence, and customer care.
Demonstrating added value to shareholders is not at all the same thing
as winning customer loyalty. All the same, there can be little doubt
that ScottishPower would bring benefits to its prospective new
customers. The scale of the expanded operation and the security of
in-house generating capacity must be important attractions to Manweb's
customers.
Shareholders and customers will be the main focus of ScottishPower's
overtures in the coming weeks but there will also be a powerful
sub-plot. Local and national politicians together with assorted interest
groups will seek to explore the economic development implications in the
union of these two power companies. Both serve industrial conurbations
which have undergone painful industrial changes. In each area there are
expectations that the electricity companies and the other utilities
should have a leadership role in industrial regeneration.
ScottishPower has a good story to tell on this front. They have been
very supportive of developing companies in Scotland. Their close
relationship with the Scottish Electronics Forum to ensure standards of
power supplies to meet the exacting demands of that important industry
is widely praised. The company's participation in the Rosyth 2000
consortium to redevelop the redundant naval base on the Forth is another
example of the company's farsightedness in economic development affairs.
It may be that Manweb has similar feathers in its industrial
development cap. In any event North-west industrial development
interests have nothing to fear and everything to gain from
ScottishPower's involvement in their territory.
No doubt there will be some disadvantages in the takeover of Manweb by
ScottishPower. Short-term employment reductions would seem likely.
Regional sensitivities will be upset and every hole in the road will be
blamed on the damned Scots. Serious as these worries may be they are not
sufficient to result in a monopolies commission reference.
Government has been adamant for some years that mergers can only be
frustrated on competition grounds. Since the competition between the
companies is modest and confined to commercial and industrial customers
there would appear to be little difficulty on that score. Indeed, at an
energy conference a couple of years ago, I well remember a director of
Manweb bitterly complaining that he could not sell power in Scotland
because ScottishPower's prices were too low!
In any case the outlook on competition is rather obscure. In two
years' time, allegedly, even we humble householders will be able to buy
our electricity from any company we choose. This privilege, currently
available only to large consumers, will be possible by the companies
using each other's wires to serve their individual customers anywhere in
the country.
ScottishPower should press its suit for Manweb with the utmost vigour.
Together they will amount to a very substantial company. It would be
nice to win one for a change.

Development and Industry.

IF Jim Hewitson is buying, I'll have a wee half. His good-natured
piece (The babble over linguist Bruce, July 15), however, understates
the argument.
Bruce was not only French-speaking, he was part of a conquering elite
which took over Britain in the eleventh century as thoroughly as did the
Romans a millennium earlier.
No-one would argue that the Roman Conquest was only a matter of
language and that the third-century Roman occupiers had become native
Britons whose ancestors were merely Italian immigrants.

DETECTIVES are investigating a bizarre raid on a Scots chicken
processing plant during which a security guard was tied up.
The masked gang stole 80 drums of industrial detergents and used one
of the factory's vehicles, decorated with a distinctive Marshall's
Chunky Chicken logo, to drive through a perimeter fence and make their
escape.
The raid, in which the alarm system was jammed with polyurethane foam,
took place about 3.50am on Monday at the premises of D B Marshall, at
Newbridge, Midlothian.
Yesterday, agricultural managing director Mr Stuart Smith said: ''We
don't understand it at all. The stolen property is only common
agricultural disinfectant but it certainly appears to have been a very
professional raid.
''The alarm system was jammed and they jemmied their way into one of
our storage areas.''
Mr Smith added that the security guard was unhurt and recovering but
had been shaken by the incident.
Police said the stolen material, which included a number of blue
overalls, was valued at #3000.
After the theft the three men, all wearing black balaclavas, smashed
through a fence in a Ford Transit lorry. It is thought to have extensive
frontal damage.
Police appealed for witnesses and said the lorry's registration number
was D945 BSX and it was towing a green trailer.
The industrial drums were made of heavy duty bright yellow plastic and
contained fluids.
Police issued descriptions of two of the gang. One was in his 20s,
about 6ft, with an Edinburgh accent while the second, aged about 50, had
a Glasgow accent. No description was available for the third man.
Detective Inspector Donnie Stewart, at Livingston police station,
said: ''It is unusual but we are considering the possibility that the
items may have been stolen to order.''

Brussels
NATO planners appeared to be making progress last night towards
solving a dispute about who would take a decision to bomb Bosnian Serb
positions if Gorazde and other enclaves are attacked.
After almost continuous discussions since Saturday, Nato ambassadors
were gathered again in Brussels to agree a detailed plan drawn up by the
alliance's senior military strategists. But the talks were bedevilled by
a dispute among the major powers -- especially Britain and the United
States -- over the workings of the so-called ''dual key'' system.
This is the procedure under which permission for air strikes must come
both from Nato commanders and from the United Nations. Mr Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, UN Secretary General, has a say in ordering air strikes.
His negotiator in Bosnia, Mr Yasushi Akashi, is responsible for
sanctioning close air support in defence of UN troops. Nato's commander
in Naples, Admiral Leighton Smith, also holds a key, along with the UN
commander in Bosnia, General Rupert Smith.
There was speculation as the meeting continued last night that Nato
planners wanted both keys held by General Smith and Admiral Smith under
a much less cumbersome procedure.
One Nato diplomat said: ''No-one is questioning the principle of the
dual key, but we need to make the system more efficient. We need the
shortest command structure possible.''
Diplomats were given first details of the military master plan on
Monday afternoon. It was then discussed in capitals of the 16 Nato
nations. The Nato ambassadors again went into session in the afternoon
yesterday to consider how to produce an amended plan which answered the
concerns mainly of the major troop-contributing states.
''There is a great deal of consensus and a general feeling that a
political deal has to be found,'' a Nato official said during a break in
the talks. The break was called to allow diplomats to consult with their
governments.
Earlier Nato officials had asked the UN to be ''more liberal'' in its
use of the dual key system. Complaints had been made to the UN by Nato
suggesting that the reputations of both organisations were suffering
because of confusion and uncertainty.
''We realise the UN is not going to give away its key, so the military
committee is recommending lowering the level of the key and extending
the time frame,'' an alliance source said.
Strong backing for doing away with the dual-key system, or at least
making it less complicated, has come from leading American politicians,
including Republican presidential hopeful, Senator Bob Dole. Britain has
resisted American pressure because it is a major troop-contributing
country and anxious to make sure no action is taken against the Bosnian
Serbs which would put British soldiers in new danger.
In Paris, a senior French official said the Brussels meeting also
discussed a French compromise proposal between the dual key system and
US demands for a free hand to conduct air strikes. This idea was put by
President Jacques Chirac to President Bill Clinton in a telephone call.
The official said the idea would allow French General Bernard Janvier,
commander of the UN protection force, to call in close air support and
pinpoint air strikes to stop specific Serb tank movements.
President Clinton reportedly replied that he had ''reservations''
about leaving the final decision to Mr Boutros-Ghali.
The US Senate resumed debate yesterday on lifting the Bosnia arms
embargo and Mr Dole, the Senate Republican leader, dismissed an appeal
from Mr Clinton that the Senate reject that action.
Mr Dole said he wanted a clear cut Senate vote to lift the embargo so
Bosnian Muslims could arm and defend themselves against Serbs.
The Clinton administration wants to work with its allies to defend all
remaining UN enclaves in Bosnia from being overrun by Serbs, and Mr
Clinton told the Senate in a letter its action would ''make a bad
situation worse''.
But Mr Dole said there was nothing new in Mr Clinton's appeal.
''It is our view that this (UN peacekeeping) mission has failed,'' Mr
Dole said. ''We ought to admit that and encourage our British and French
friends to leave.''
The Senate began a debate on the measure last week but Mr Dole, at Mr
Clinton's request, postponed a vote until after a special international
conference on the Balkans war in London on Friday. Mr Dole has expressed
disappointment with the results of that meeting.
Meanwhile, a US Air Force commander said that Western warplanes could
be ready to strike within minutes if the UN and Nato decide to carry out
threats of the hardest air strikes yet against Serb forces.
''We have aircraft on alert now, we can respond about as fast as they
can ask us to,'' Colonel Charles F. Wald told reporters at the Aviano
airbase in north-east Italy.
''Some aircraft would be ready to respond within an hour, we're always
ready for that,'' said Mr Wald, who is commander of the US 31st Fighter
Wing stationed at the base.
But if aircraft were already in the air near a trouble spot, response
time could be measured in minutes.
''Many times we have responded in minutes -- assuming we have an
airplane in the air at that particular time. If we don't have that, we
have aircraft on the ground on alert,'' said Mr Wald.
He is responsible for operations of British and Spanish as well as US
aircraft flying from Aviano under Nato operations to enforce United
Nations resolutions in Bosnia.
Reaction time also depended on what targets they were given to hit.
''If it's a non-moveable target, we'll take all the time we need and do
it on our terms,'' Mr Wald said.
Western powers have threatened air strikes at ''unprecedented levels''
if Bosnian Serbs attack the UN ''safe area'' of Gorazde.
Mr Wald declined to say what unprecedented levels might mean, but
added that warring factions in former Yugoslavia ''could probably use
their imagination'' over the extent of airpower.
As far as selecting targets for strikes went, that was a UN and Nato
policy decision, he said.
Nato has been meeting in recent days to give substance to a
toughly-worded declaration on Friday from 16 nations involved in trying
to halt the war in former Yugoslavia.
Mr Wald said that from take-off at Aviano planes would take around 25
minutes to reach Bosnia.
Aviano is the base of US Captain Scott O'Grady, whose F-16 was shot
down by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) over Bosnia in May. Mr Wald said
that the Bosnian Serb SAMs represented a significant threat.
Asked if the air force had changed its method of operation to counter
this threat, he said: ''Every day, we change our tactics and adjust them
accordingly.''

SCIENTISTS believe they are on the brink of producing a vaccine which
will effectively eradicate cervical cancer, it was disclosed yesterday.
The vaccine has already been successfully tested on animals, and
trials with human volunteers are expected within two or three years. It
could lead to cervical cancer, which kills thousands of women each year,
being virtually wiped out.
The vaccine works by building up immunity to a sexually-transmitted
wart virus -- Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) -- known to be the main cause
of the disease and thought to be rampant among young women.
A programme in Granada TV's Lady Killers series being screened tonight
claims that a quarter of women aged 25 are infected at any one time.
Professor Julian Peto, from the Institute of Cancer Research, says on
the programme that 50% of women aged 25-30 have probably had the virus
at some stage.
The professor said last night that a team from the Institute of Cancer
Research has been working with other scientists from a number of cancer
research organisations. He and his team had studied 1000 cervical cancer
cases from around the world and found the virus present in 93%.
The virus, which produces no symptoms, remains for only about a year
in its host before vanishing. But the risk of re-infection is very high.
Professor Peto said: ''The vaccine we are developing works in dogs,
cows, rabbits and mice. We believe the likelihood is that it will work
in humans too.''
He stressed that being infected by HPV did not make it certain that a
woman would get cervical cancer. But having sex at a young age increased
the risk.
''Most people who smoke don't die of lung cancer, and this is a
similar thing. But if it wasn't for cervical screening, there would be a
really substantial epidemic.''

perfectly preserved by the cold, were spotted under about 3ft of ice in
the Vignemale glacier by four Spanish friends of the two, who returned
to the site to mark the fourth anniversary of their deaths.

The most prestigious grandmaster tournament to be staged in Scotland
got underway yesterday. John Linklater describes events
CONSIDERING it has given its name to the most famous figurative chess
set in history, Lewis had made a comparatively modest contribution to
the actual playing of the game until yesterday.
The Lewis Chess Club was formed only two years ago in the wake of
interest aroused by the televising of the world championship between
Gary Kasparov and Nigel Short, and it has a largely primary school age
membership. Nobody is quite able to explain how it came to be hosting
the most prestigious grandmaster tournament ever seen in Scotland.
In the imposingly restored Museum nan Eilean, occupying a former
annexe of the Nicholson Institute, the grandmaster tournament got
underway in a morning session which saw Nigel Short lose on time to
Hungary's Judit Polgar, who celebrated her nineteenth birthday in
Stornoway on Monday and is still on track to pose a serious threat to
become the first woman champion of a game which was once portrayed as
beyond female comprehension. In the other game Scotland's first
grandmaster, Paul Motwani of Dundee, agreed a draw under time pressure
of his own from former professional footballer Simen Agdestein of
Norway.
These were heady enough exchanges, watched by a growing crowd of
mesmerised spectators who stood pressed up in a little chain cordon to
watch these gladiators of the mind at their work or gathered round two
video monitors to analyse close-up relays of the action, but it was the
pervasive presence of the famous Lewis Chess Men themselves that made
the occasion all the more remarkable.
True, those venerable twelfth-century pieces did not share the same
boards, or even the same room, as the latter-day adversaries, but they
were only one flight below in the same museum and the special presence
they brought to the tournament was unmistakable.
To view these remarkable pieces in their glass cases is to witness the
enduring struggle of the game of chess, exquisitely carved on the very
expressions of the pieces. The Warders (as the rooks were called in this
medieval Scandinavian depiction of the forces) bite their shields in
anticipation of the frenzy of battle.
The Queens cover their alarmed faces with their right hands, the Kings
test the sharpness of their swords, the Bishops look on with startled
piety, the Knights mount their steeds and present their spears, while
the pawns are evocative tombstones. They are pieces prepared for the
ultimate psychology of foreboding and stress.
Upstairs it was like that, though tightly muted, a thinly suppressed
violence executed in silence. The players conceal their terrible
aggressions and anxieties at the board, but the eyes of the spectator
finds an unexpected focus for their body language of attack and defence,
thrust and retreat. It is in their feet. The agitation of their feet is
ceaseless, and they send up the truest signals of the inner turmoils.
Motwani sits square in tight formation, his arms forward on the table,
his feet neatly packed under his chair.
His opponent Agdestein grapples the legs of his chair in a double
tackle that would have once pleased his coach for the Norway Under-21
side, or earned him a yellow card. Short sits splayed, as though
preparing to do the splits. Polgar is the real aggressor with her feet.
She digs the toes of her heeled white shoes into the green carpet as
though searching for the stirrups, or she swings one tapping ankle over
a black-trousered knee under the table.
She looks frighteningly dominant for a figure so frail, and whatever
she does it meets with the steady scrutiny in the front row of her
father, Dr Laszlo Polgar, the psychologist who trained her and two
sisters to international chess careers from early childhood.
An unexpected incident disturbed the intensity of these silent
grapplings yesterday. The digital clocks, used by the players to measure
the time consumed by the terrible plots they hatched at the board, were
discovered midway to have been improperly programmed by the arbiter.
There was a long and deeply embarrassing delay after the players, in
both games, had reached the statutory 90-minute control for their first
30 moves. The clocks would not move on. Arbiter David Wallace painfully
perused the instruction manual in vain. Polgar grimaced philosophically.
Short fretted and fumed, started reading an issue of Scottish Chess
magazine, resorted to staring darkly out the leaded window, and finally
flounced off with a dismissive wave of his hand.
After a 30-minute delay play was resumed with traditional manual
clocks, the kind you wind up, and if that was the case the damage
appeared to have been done to Short who lost his composure and then lost
by going over the total two-hour allowance for all moves. It was
ventured that he would not be asking Mr Wallace to programme his video,
or set his digital alarm.
This was not the only stushie of the opening day's proceedings. The
convener of the Western Isles Islands Council, Donald M Mackay, was
moved to issue an overnight press release condemning press statements
that had incorrectly credited Lewis Chess Club with the coup of getting
the Lewis Chess Men to Stornoway for the historic exhibition.
The initiative had, of course, been the council's in patient
negotiations with the trustees of the British Museum and the National
Museums of Scotland. The young club then mounted a campaign, supported
by the council, to have the pieces granted for a historic publicity
photograph with the grandmasters. That event will be staged on Thursday,
under the nervous gaze of British Museum custodians who appear to fear
the immediate disintegration of the Walrus ivory pieces under so much as
the touch of the grandmasters.
It has been a campaign of magnificent chutzpah, and it has led to the
further demand for some of the pieces to remain in their place of
finding, 164 years ago on dunes above Uig Beach in circumstances still
shrouded in myth and mystery. The heady concessions gained so far by the
campaign has led to an overspill of tensions in Stornoway, but nothing
can marr the improbable success of the tournament now under way.
There are 250 players in all competitions, the majority doing combat
over in the Nicholson Institute, and chess is temporarily the rage in
every one of Stornoway's 20-odd bars and pubs. Don't whisper it to the
exalted seriousness of the grandmasters, but the slogan ringing out here
is ''Less thinking, more drinking''. Perhaps this bibulous euphoria
might help to explain how the Lewis Chess Men came to be lost in the
first place, a mystery never previously explained. The assurance is that
it will never happen twice.

Anne Johnstone explores the vexing issue of research which suggests
foetuses are being feminised by oestrogens in the environment
ARECENT Greenpeace advert declared: ''You're not half the man your
father was.'' The text went on to explain that scientists had shown that
chemical pollution was interfering with the hormones of male foetuses
causing a disastrous decline in male fertility.
Yesterday's report from the Department of the Environment
(Environmental Oestrogens: Consequences to human health and wildlife)
shows that it ain't quite that simple.
The report considers three apparently inter-related topics: declining
male fertility; the so-called ''sea of oestrogen'' (man-made chemicals
which get into the environment and enter the food chain and which may be
mimicking the female hormone oestrogen), and the effects of high doses
of these chemicals on the reproductive systems of animals.
Paisley-born Dr Lewis Smith of Leicester University, one of the
report's contributors, claims that on all three counts there is cause
for concern.
''Despite a lot of conflicting evidence, it seems more rather than
less likely that there has been a fall in male fertility,'' he said
yesterday. Both sperm counts and sperm quality appear to be under
attack, and there have been increases in cryptorchidism (undescended
testicles), hypospadias (congenital malformation of the penis),
testicular cancer, and male breast-cancer.
The report looked at a grim-sounding catalogue of environmental
oestrogens.
''A number of the chemicals that have been implicated have been tested
on animals at high doses. Some have produced effects on the testes,''
said Dr Smith. In one recent example, fish in a river contaminated with
sewage were found to be developing female characteristics.
Where Dr Smith and the rest of the DoE research team fall out with
Greenpeace and other environmental campaigners is at the next stage of
the argument. The campaigners claim that the link between declining
male-fertility and environmental oestrogens is so strong that the
Government must act to protect the nation's sexual health.
Dr Richard Dixon, head of research for Friends of the Earth Scotland,
said: ''The Government should apply the precautionary principle to
protect the public from gender-bending pollution. Bland reassurances and
moves towards more research are unacceptable.''
Dr Smith and his team believe it is neither practical nor sensible to
ban all the chemicals quoted as potentially harmful: ''Just because a
chemical can be shown to have an effect on animals at high-dose levels
doesn't mean that low-dose levels in humans will create an effect. It
may. That's what we have to find out next.
0 But the report also concludes that it would be dangerous to do
nothing.
Dr Smith said there has been a decline in sperm quality as well as
quantity. Many simply aren't up to the job. They don't swim strongly
enough or haven't the strength to penetrate the ovum. In our parents'
generation the male side of the equation was reckoned to account for
just 10% of infertility in couples. Now it's 25% and growing. What's
worse poor sperm production is associated with a rise in testicular
cancer among younger men.
Much of the research required will focus on early foetal life. The
crucial period in the development of the testes in the male foetus is
the first trimester (three months) of pregnancy, just the time that the
level of female hormones are at their lowest in the mother. The
suspicion is that the ingestion of oestrogen in food or water could
hamper the production in the testes of the unborn of Sertoli cells.
''If Sertoli cells are disrupted in the development phase, you end up
with fewer sperm cells, smaller testes, and less ability to produce
sperm,'' said Dr Smith.
The priority now, he says, must be to identify which chemicals in the
environment are causally linked with falling sperm counts. We can't have
an apparent 40% to 50% reduction in male sperm counts without scientists
and the Government being required to try to understand this
phenomenon,'' said Dr Smith.
SPERM COUNT
* IS male fertility in fact declining? A major Danish study in 1992
concluded there had been a decline around 40% in 50 years. This analysis
was widely questioned by those who pointed out the difficulty of
obtaining accurate results from sperm tests. (The number of live sperm
in a sample depends on the time that has elapsed since the last
ejaculation.)
However, two further studies also pointed to a major decline in sperm
counts. The first was a Scottish study of semen donors between 1940 and
1969 and the second, published earlier this year, examined the
concentration and quality of sperm in donors to a Paris sperm bank
between 1973 and 1992. This showed an annual average decline of 2%.
OESTROGENS
* ARE environmental oestrogens to blame? The jury is still out on this
one. A number of factors have been considered in the past, including
radiation, smoking, alcohol, drug abuse, and even the frequency of
sexual intercourse. There is no doubt that high doses of oestrogen can
affect the reproductive biology of animals. For example, male fish
exposed to high levels of compounds found in egg yolk protein.
These are normally only produced in sexually mature female fish. The
birth in Florida of alligators with half-male, half-female sex organs,
suggest that some common pesticides can have the effect of feminising
male foetuses.
The DoE report says it is too easy to assume that if chemicals affect
reproduction in animals, they must do the same in humans.

HE surrender of IRA weapons in advance of all-party talks in Nothern
Ireland was firmly ruled out by Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams
yesterday.
Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and the Irish Deputy Premier Dick
Spring have spoken of their hopes of movement towards the
decommissioning of weapons but there are no signs of a break in the
impasse.
The Government again has insisted there will be no place for Sinn Fein
at the negotiating table until the IRA starts handing over its arms.
British and Irish Ministers are considering the possibility of some
sort of international commission which could take charge of any moves by
republicans and loyalists to get rid of their weapons. But Mr Adams
repeated he was not prepared to accept the decommissioning of weapons as
a precondition for Sinn Fein's involvement in all-party talks.
He said he had told Sir Patrick this when he met him for secret talks
in Londonderry one week ago. Mr Adams said: ''The only precondition (for
the IRA) is that it would call a complete cessation of its military
operations. It has done that. It has kept to that and it has been very
honourable about that.
''I met Sir Patrick Mayhew last week and I told him of my very firm
conviction that, while we needed to take all the guns out of Irish
politics, this was a new precondition placed by his Government as an
obstacle to forwards movement and in my view the IRA was not prepared to
decommission or surrender any of its weapons unilaterally.
''Nor would any of the other armed groups in this situation and what
we need to do is to move foward into talks.''
Mr Spring said after meeting Sir Patrick in a move aimed at ending the
stalemate: ''I am hopeful the decomissioning issue can be resolved and
we have to do everything which is necessary to resolve that.
''We have overcome other difficulties in the past 12 months and I
believe the determination of both governments, and hopefully the
parties, will help overcome that difficulty as well.''
But oppositon party Fianna Fail's foreign affairs spokesman, Mr Ray
Burke, said the Ministerial talks had generated ''a sense of
disappointment'', adding: ''Nothing came out of the meeting.''
Mr Adams said of the proposal for an independent body to oversee the
decommissioning of arms: ''The whole notion of putting a commission will
have to be judged in the context of it as a way merely of fudging,
protracting, and prolonging this impasse.''
He acknowledged there was an impasse and a potential crisis but said
he still believed there would be an overall settlement at some stage.
''If we don't tackle the causes of conflict, we then start to slip
back into the old position. I don't want that,'' he said. ''I am totally
committed and our party is committed to a democratic, negotiated
settlement of this conflict.
''It is my view we are going to get that. Whether we get it under this
Government, whether we get it this year, it is my view we will continue
to focus until we bring that about.''
Mr Burke said a report on the state of the peace process would be
presented today to the Irish parliament, due to interrupt its summer
break for procedural reasons.
Criticising the outcome of Monday night's meeting at Hillsborough
Castle, County Down, he said: ''What we really need at this stage is a
move to break the peace process log-jam to allow all-party talks on
Northern Ireland to begin, but nothing came out of yesterday.''
Mr Burke, a former Irish Justice Minister, added: ''If the logjam had
been broken, it would have been announced last night with a blare of
trumpets, and rightly so.
''But at this stage it not sufficient for them to come out and say
they are still committed to the peace process. We need something in
relation to all-party talks and the para-military prisoners issue. That
is absolutely essential.''
Meanwhile, the leader of a group of Dublin parliamentarians who met
Irish prisoners in three British jails this week last night gave a mixed
reaction to comments on the prisons by Home Secretary Michael Howard.
Mr Joe Costello, who headed a four-strong delegation from the Irish
Labour party in visits to Full Sutton, Belmarsh, and Whitemoor jails,
welcomed Mr Howard's move to investigate complaints made by the Irish
prisoners about conditions.
But he expressed ''deep disappointment'' at the Home Secretary's
attitude to two recommendations by the Labour group -- a call for the
speeding up of transfers to Irish jails and the recategorising of
prisoners now embracing the Northern Ireland peace process.
In a BBC radio interview, Mr Howard said there was no prospect of
changing rules to permit transfers from British jails.
In a comment endorsed by Irish government sources, Mr Costello said:
''We are not asking for any change in rules. Mr Howard has been
inaccurate there. We are asking that the transfers should be speeded up,
that there is a more flexible regime, and a more sensible approach taken
to the issue. Transfers to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
would solve the problem entirely.''
* Defence Secretary Michael Portillo met Army chiefs in Ulster for the
first time yesterday. The GOC, Lieutenant General Sir Roger Wheeler,
briefed him at Army headquarters at Lisburn, County Antrim, on the
scaled down military presence since the start of the IRA ceasefire 11
months ago. Later, Mr Portillo met Army units throughout Northern
Ireland.

COTTAGE museum dedicated to painter James Paterson, a founder of The
Glasgow Boys, has been opened in the Dumfriesshire village of Moniaive
where he lived and worked for 22 years.
The project is the brainchild of his grand-daughter, Mrs Anne Paterson
Wallace, also an artist.
Unable to acquire Paterson's original studio, she bought the small,
whitewashed cottage as a home for all the memorabilia she has collected
over the years.
She hopes to create a replica of the artist's studio and conservatory,
featuring furnishings from his house, Kilniess, on the outskirts of the
village, which have been preserved by his family.
The little museum, at Meadowcraft, North Street, already contains a
comprehensive archive of Paterson's life and work: letters to other
artists, photographs, sketches, books and copies of his oils and
watercolours.
Mrs Wallace, 72, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, said: ''My grandfather was
an excellent and most prolific artist. His work hangs in art galleries
and in private collections all over the world and is greatly prized.
''He did much of his finest work during his years in Moniaive and I
would like the village to become a mecca for his admirers and students.
It could become like Giverny, the French village where Paterson's
friend, the impressionist, Claude Monet, lived.''
She can hardly remember him. ''I was just nine when he died, but I
have been brought up among his paintings and I have come to love them
and have done a lot of research into his life and work.''
Paterson was born in 1854, the fourth child of a prosperous Glasgow
textile manufacturer who himself had a keen interest in the arts.
He worked in the family firm before studying in Glasgow and Paris.
He later made a series of visits to Moniaive where he married a local
girl, Eliza Ferguson.
His parents gave him a cottage known as Kilniess as a wedding gift,
and he had it enlarged and altered to include a studio and conservatory.
It is now privately owned, outwith the family.
Paterson was elected a Royal Scottish Academician in 1896.
Of The Glasgow Boys, who flourished in the last 30 years of last
century, and were greatly influenced by French artists, Mrs Wallace
said: ''In their day, they were looked on as rebels and were given a
rough time by newspaper art critics. But their work is now very highly
rated.''
The Moniaive museum will be open at weekends until October.

Lahore, Tuesday
PAKISTANI cricket hero Imran Khan said today his marriage to British
heiress Jemima Goldsmith last month did not compromise his nationalist
ideas.
In his first meeting with reporters since his return home at the
weekend, he rejected suggestions that he planned to enter politics and
said he would launch an educational movement to increase literacy.
Jemima did not accompany Imran at the news conference where he was
asked whether their marriage compromised his denunciation in recent
months of Western culture and criticism of Pakistanis who embraced it.
He had dubbed them ''brown sahibs''.
''People should have no objection to my marriage to an English lady as
she has embraced Islam and adopted the Pakistani culture,'' Imran said.
''This is in no way in contravention of my theory of brown sahibs.''
Hundeds of fans chanted slogans urging Imran to enter politics when he
and Jemima, daugther of a Jewish tycoon, arrived in Lahore on Saturday
after a Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
However the former cricket captain said today that he was not entering
politics because he felt he could not bring change to what he called a
corrupt political system.
''People want a change in the system because it does not represent the
people,'' he said.
He said some of his statements criticising politicians and demanding
reforms were misunderstood as an indication of his desire to join
politics.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Around world in 18 days for Branson</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977207553</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ADVENTURER Richard Branson yesterday promised to travel a good deal
quicker than fictional hero Phileas Fogg and go around the world in 18
days . . . by balloon.
The man who said ''never again'' after his dangerous but successful
transatlantic and transpacific balloon crossings, is now set to take to
the air in a complete circumnavigation of the globe.
The multi-millionaire Virgin Group chief announced his latest act of
derring-do at the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich in south London.
If all goes well it will be from Greenwich that Mr Branson takes off,
sometime between November and January on his 13,000 mile adventure in
which he will harness jet-stream winds to complete his trip.
Asked what his wife Joan said when she heard he was once again risking
his life, Mr Branson joked: ''She asked, 'Who's getting the island?'.''
This was a jokey reference to Necker, in the Caribbean Virgin Islands,
which the Bransons own.
Mr Branson's partner on the circumnavigation will be balloonist Per
Lindstrand, who accompanied the airline chief on the Atlantic and
Pacific crossings.
This time the pair will have a third -- as yet unnamed -- crew member,
whose presence will enable everyone to get some sleep.
Mr Branson said yesterday: ''This will be great fun and it is the
ultimate adventure. Teams from other countries are planning similar
trips and we felt we should give them a run for their money.''
The Branson flight will use a 200-year-old principle hit upon by
pioneer balloonist Jean Francois de Rozier, who evolved a combined hot
air and hydrogen balloon.
The Branson team, however, will be using a much safer inert gas,
helium, which will be kept warm with propane burners during the hours of
darkness to maintain altitude and speed by remaining in the jet-stream.
The balloon could travel as fast as 200mph and the crew will fly at a
height of more than 30,000ft in a pressurised cabin.
Mr Branson admitted that part of the reason for the flight was to
promote his Virgin Cola.
He said: ''This is a way of mixing adventure with commerce. It will be
a great challenge. We wanted to do something that's not been done
before. Others are interested and we felt we should try to beat them to
it.''

James McKillop explains why discounts on calls and higher rental
charges suit BT's quest for expansion
THOSE with teenage children living at home will find it difficult to
believe. As a nation we don't really rabbit that much on the telephone.
The average daily dose of phone conversations in this country is a
mere eight minutes and 40 seconds. It is for that reason British Telecom
thinks it more than worthwhile it should employ at vast expense the
persuasive Mr Bob Hoskins to send home a message: ''It is good to
talk.''
The aim is to keep us on the line for an additional 30 seconds a day.
This short extra speaking time will not add too much to individual
quarterly bills, but will surely add to the profits and untold wealth of
British Telecom.
Without doubt this high-profile advertising campaign is important in
an increasingly competitive market.
The very fact that competition is growing makes yesterday's
announcement that BT can push up rental charges a very attractive
proposition.
This arrangement offers a huge leeway for the vastly rich company to
come up with new methods of encouraging us all to stay on the telephone
line longer. It could for example totally discount the cost of the first
30 minutes of local calls on the bill.
As a consequence, BT executives are already licking their lips over
the deals they might now be able to put on offer.
From their point of view, we should all become more ''phone friendly''
and as a consequence create greater profits for BT.
No matter what you might think when the quarterly bill comes in,
charges set by British Telecom are not the most expensive in the world.
In all probability its charges are in the middle range.
Indeed the 1p charge for local calls at weekends can only be beaten in
Hong Kong where all weekend calls are free.
Following Margaret Thatcher, Britain has led the way in Europe by
privatising telephone companies. As a consequence, those countries which
maintain monopolies offer the dearest telephone services.
Portugal is head of the list as being the most expensive
telecommunications company on the Continent. But Spain and Italy are not
far behind.
Ignoring the high cost of living in Sweden, perhaps this is the
country you might chose to live in if your ear is permanently attached
to a telephone.
A local call there will cost 2p for three minutes; a national call
roughly over 200 miles costs 20p for the same time; but an international
call costs #1.51 for the same three minutes. The equivalent rates in the
UK are 9p; 21p; and 88p.
Country by country the list below establishes who gets the best deal.
The country offering cheapest rates being the first mentioned.
* Local calls: Canada (no charge); Sweden; the United States;
Netherlands; Italy; France; Germany; the UK; Belgium; and Austria.
* National calls: Sweden; UK; Netherlands; Canada; US; Belgium;
Austria; Italy; France; and Germany.
* International calls: Canada; UK; Sweden; US; Australia; France;
Netherlands; Belgium; Italy; Germany.
Line rental charges also have to be taken into account. Canada, which
offers the cheapest calls, charges #34 a month for line rental. The UK
features around the middle of this league of nations.
It all comes down to a matter of competition, until now most of which,
for BT, has come from Mercury.
Mercury is offering the cheapest prices for telecommunications in
Europe to corporate organisations. Hence the low deals offered by BT on
international and national calls.
With the advent of cable, the picture is moving on a bit, and BT will
be forced to rethink its package offered to all customers, not just the
big companies.
Cable companies are now offering a package to householders which goes
beyond what they can pick up on their television screens. One company
guarantees a 25% discount on telephone calls -- providing serious
competition for British Telecom.
A year ago there were only 400,000 users linked up to cable who could
take up the opportunity of getting a cable telephone service. This year
there is more than 1,000,000. Next year?
Certainly it is small scale compared to the 20,000,000 plus customers
who pay their bills to BT, but the number opting for cable is growing at
a rapid rate and that is worrying for BT.
Apart from the 25% guaranteed discount already offered by some cable
companies, as their network grows they are also able to offer free
telephone calls to those linked to their system.
Companies, such as Mercury, have attacked BT at the business end and
now the cable companies are snapping at its heels in the residential
sector.
BT is a market leader but will have to cut charges to the consumer to
stay on top of the competition, analyst Brian Rusling from Yamaichi
International (Europe) Ltd, said yesterday. Rusling said the
announcement on charges should help BT do this. But, he added,
competition remains fierce and while not recommending that anybody
should get rid of their BT shares, Rusling suggested that fast bucks
were more likely to be made by those investing in the mobile telephone
market.
Yes, he accepted, BT was coming to the end of its massive redundancy
programme, which has been hugely expensive, but the company would have
to continue to spend massive sums on technology that would allow
interactive shopping and banking for customers from the comfort of their
homes.
But he confirmed: ''Despite any fears of a recession round the corner,
anybody who invested in telecommunications would be unlikely to lose
out.''
At the end of the day BT would be in there fighting against all of the
international competition.

Jerusalem, Tuesday
CHIEF Israeli and PLO negotiators were to decide on the future of
peace talks suspended today while the Jewish state buried victims of a
Palestinian suicide bus bombing.
All five Israelis killed in yesterday's blast in the Tel Aviv suburb
of Ramat Gan were to be buried today and most Israelis were opposed to
resuming negotiations, according to a poll.
''The meeting was set to determine where and when to renew the
talks,'' said Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuval Fuchs about a
meeting between negotiators Uri Savir of Israel and Ahmed Korei of the
PLO.
Peacemakers, hoping to ease pressure on themselves, planned to take
the talks abroad, perhaps to Europe, but PLO leader Yasser Arafat made
clear today that he wanted them close to home, so that he could meet
negotiators regularly.
The talks on extending self-rule from Gaza and Jericho to all of the
West Bank and on an Israeli troops redeployment have been stalled
primarily over security issues.
At the site of the bombing in Ramat Gan, small groups of Israelis wept
and lit memorial candles for the victims, all of whom were aged
60-plus.--Reuter.

POLICE last night warned people to be careful around harbours after an
early morning incident involving two young men in the holiday town of
Millport.
A full-scale rescue operation was launched after the two were reported
missing in the sea around the town's harbour area.
Mr Ian Carruth, 24, of Nether Kirkton Farm, Millport, had fallen into
the water and his friend, Mr Barry McInhill, 22, of Craigilea Drive,
Paisley, launched a dinghy in an attempt to rescue him. The dinghy
capsized and left both men in the water.
When they could not be traced immediately the inshore lifeboat from
Largs was launched and a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter from HMS Gannet
at Prestwick was scrambled to join the search.
When the two men were found, Mr McInhill was treated for a cut eye
while Mr Carruth was flown to hospital in Kilmarnock for observation.

A WOMAN police sergeant who sued for #750,000 damages after former
Celtic footballer Tony Cascarino collided with her on the touchline
during a match yesterday won the first round of her legal battle.
A judge ruled that the case of Mrs Rachel Gillon, 33, whose police
career ended after the accident during an Airdrie-Celtic game at
Broomfield Park on November 23, 1991, should continue at the Court of
Session, with evidence being heard at a date to be fixed.
Lord Coulsfield, in a written judgment, refused Airdrieonians'
petition to dismiss the action at this stage. The judge added:
''Although I think her averments may be of doubtful relevancy, I have
come to the conclusion that I cannot exclude the possibility that she
may succeed.''
At the earlier hearing the court was told that Mrs Gillon, of
Glencairn Road, Langbank, Renfrewshire, sued Strathclyde's Chief
Constable and Airdrieonians Football and Athletic Company, blaming them
for the accident.
She claimed that she was patrolling the perimeter track, watching the
crowd, when a fight broke out. She instructed two constables by radio to
attend to the fight and stayed in her position at the edge of the field
to monitor the disturbance and call for reinforcements if necessary.
She was standing facing the crowd, as she had been instructed, when
''suddenly and without warning she was hit with great force from behind
by Celtic player Tony Cascarino, who was chasing the ball which bounced
off the field of play''.
Mrs Gillon claimed that the player knocked her unconscious. She was
taken to hospital and woke up in intense pain. Later she felt
considerable pain in her upper body, right lower back and right leg.
This restricted her ability to move freely. After further treatment
she went back to work. But because of continuing pain she went on sick
leave on May 1, 1992, and was medically retired from Strathclyde police
force on December 20, 1992. She has not been able to work since then.
She claimed the accident changed her life. She can no longer walk any
great distance, or swim, or go jogging or have the pleasure of rough and
tumble games with her young son. She claimed she has had to rely on her
husband to help with a great many domestic chores. She claimed that she
has to take tablets to ease the constant pain which she suffers.
Mrs Gillon claimed she has become ''morose, depressed, anxious and
upset'' at having to give up her promising career in the police force.
Mrs Gillon blamed the Chief Constable, claiming it was his duty to
devise a safe system of work for officers policing football grounds.
At the earlier hearing Mr Derek Emslie, QC, for Airdrieonians, had
asked that the case should be dismissed without a hearing of evidence.
He claimed there were no relevant claims to indicate there was a
foreseeable real risk of injury.
There were no relevant claims to indicate that the failure to build a
separating wall or barrier at the edge of the pitch represented a
failure on the club's part to take reasonable care. There were no
relevant claims, he said, to show that a failure to widen the track
represented a failure to take reasonable care.
Lord Coulsfield added that the pros and cons of whether a barrier
should have been provided could be addressed at the hearing of evidence.
The judge said that, in her claims, Mrs Gillon had said enough to
entitle her to go to a hearing of evidence.
The Chief Constable did not object to the case going to a hearing of
evidence.
Neither Mrs Gillon nor the defenders were in court.

New York, Tuesday
THE makers of Spam canned lunch meat have taken umbrage at Spa'am, an
unsavoury wild pig who portrays ''evil in porcine form'' in a new Muppet
film.
Hormel Foods has sued Jim Henson Productions in Manhattan federal
court, claiming the film company had tarnished its trademark and falsely
disparaged Spam products.
The suit, which seeks damages, asks the court to butcher Spa'am, a
''grotesque and noxious appearing wild boar'' that appears in Muppet
Treasure Island, previews of which are already showing.
Henson Productions said: ''We are sorry that Hormel apparently does
not share the Muppet sense of humour, and we certainly meant no
offence.'' Lawyers are seeking an amicable solution.--Reuter.

<RECORDNO>977207559</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CHANNEL 4 chief executive Michael Grade has signed a #450,000-a-year
deal to stay on for another five years.
The new contract makes Mr Grade, who earned #327,000 last year, one of
the highest paid executives in British television.
He also receives a #148,000 bonus under his previous contract. But
there is no provision for bonuses under the new contract, and the
company offers no share options.
It is a statement of confidence in him by the board, but Mrs Mary
Whitehouse, founder of the National Viewers and Listeners Association,
deplored the new arrangement.
''Considering the appalling quality of some of Channel 4's
transmissions, I think this is shocking in the true sense of the word,''
she said. ''He didn't need to have that increase in salary.''
The deal follows recent criticism of Channel 4 over standards of taste
and decency in The Word youth programme and the Banned season.
Channel 4 chairman Sir Michael Bishop said: ''The board is absolutely
determined to send out the strongest possible message supporting, not
just Michael Grade, but the other directors, staff, commissioning
editors and people who work for us.''
Deputy chairman David Plowright said: ''Michael Grade is the one
remaining showman with an ability to run a business in British
commercial broadcasting.
''He has the skill to create an environment in which the people who
make the programmes want to work.
''At the same time he runs an efficient business that's making money
in circumstances that people probably find surprising. He deserves his
reward.''
Mr Grade said: ''This is the finest job in television. I will do
everything in my power to keep Channel 4 on top.''
Sir Michael said Mr Grade's main task would be to try to sweep away
the funding formula which forces Channel 4 to hand over part of its
advertising revenue to the ITV companies.
Channel 4 made about #300m last year, however the formula, set up in
1993 as an insurance should the station fail to achieve advertising
targets, had cost the channel an estimated #150m in three years, Sir
Michael said.
''It's the most preposterous piece of legislation.''

THE decision to locate the headquarters of Britain's new nuclear power
company in Scotland, is not the brilliant coup for former Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang that many people gave him credit for at the time.
Bosses of the England-based Nuclear Electric company insist that it
was their idea to site the headquarters in Scotland, and was not imposed
upon them by Mr Lang.
The Scottish headquarters was one of the major reasons why opposition
to the Government decision to privatise Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear
Electric as a single entity was muted.
Scottish Nuclear has only two power stations, while Nuclear Electric
has six, and the decision to put the headquarters north of the Border
makes the marriage of the two companies look less like an English
takeover.
Mr John Robb, the #100,000-a-year part-time chairman designate of the
new company, insisted, on a visit to Scotland this week, that it would
be a proper working headquarters with a staff of 40 to 50 people.
''I can assure you it will be a meaningful office. It will be a great
deal more than a brass plate on a wall as some people have tried to
describe it.
''It will be located in Scotland for as long as I'm chairman of the
company. I don't know what else I can say to reassure people in Scotland
that this will be a proper headquarters where corporate decisions will
be made.''
A number of buildings in Edinburgh have been investigated for possible
leasing as headquarters of the as yet unnamed company -- British Nuclear
or UK Nuclear seem the most obvious names -- and a decision will be made
soon. The timetable is tight. Further board members have to be
appointed, headquarters chosen, and a prospectus put together before
publicly floating the company next summer.
Already an international sales director, Mr Alan Nichols from
Rolls-Royce, has been appointed and he and his staff will operate from
Edinburgh. In addition there will be a strong procurement division in
Scotland as Nuclear Electric already does #20m to #30m worth of business
annually with Scottish engineering firms.
Mr Robb also spoke publicly for the first time about the controversial
sacking of Mr James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear. It was a
decision which opposition MPs seized upon as another indication that
Scottish Nuclear was being taken over, rather than operating as an equal
partner, and that Mr Hann was being removed for political reasons.
Mr Robb, however, insisted that the decision was his alone, although
he was aware of the sensitivity of the Scottish dimension, and therefore
the decision was relayed to the Scottish Office for extensive
discussion.
The chairman designate of what is simply known at present as HoldCo,
said Mr Hann's departure was purely a business decision. Effectively he
had four people, the two chief executives and the two chairmen of the
existing nuclear companies who had to be fitted in to the three jobs of
chief executive and the two vice-chairmen of the new company. One of
them had to go.
He wanted people around him with more technical knowledge of the
nuclear industry than Mr Hann. Nor was there any personal animosity
between the two men as they had, in fact, only met once before the
decision was taken.
''The recommendation to reorganise the top of the company came
specifically from me,'' said Mr Robb. ''I had in mind what was
appropriate for the long-term future of the company and the required
technical skills that I wanted from both the deputy chairmen and the
chief executive.
''I wasn't very long in the job when I recognised there was a high
degree of sensitivity up here in Scotland about whether this was to be
perceived as a takeover of one company by the other and so on. But as
chairman designate I have the responsibility to get the proper structure
that meets the needs of the company.
''I made a recommendation, it was accepted, and by the time the
Cabinet reshuffle was announced we were well on course to implement the
structure that I had recommended.''
He added: ''I can't please all of the people all of the time in this
job. Somebody had to be disappointed.''
Peel House, the present Scottish Nuclear headquarters in East
Kilbride, will be retained for the engineering division already housed
there. It made sense though, according to Mr Robb, to keep the overall
headquarters separate, which was why Edinburgh was chosen. It is a
similar philosophy already employed at ScottishPower where corporate
headquarters are at Pacific Quay in Glasgow's city centre, while
administration continues at Cathcart.
Although nuclear power was not regarded as being attractive for
privatisation in the past, the senior executives of the new company
believe the time is now right.
The older Magnox reactors are not included in the sale, so the company
will be sold off with relatively modern plant already paid for by the
taxpayers with guaranteed sales of power.
Difficulties over decommissioning, reprocessing and waste management
have also been solved. Job losses at Nuclear Electric are already taking
place as the company makes itself more efficient and competitive. That
has helped reduce the unit cost of nuclear generated electricity to 2.2p
a unit, and further cost savings, without compromising safety, are
expected.
Once privatised, the company does not have to remain solely an owner
of nuclear-powered stations, and moving into gas generation is likely to
be considered by the new board once it is established. Although the
Government's recent White Paper suggested that a new commercial
nuclear-powered station was unlikely, executives of HoldCo dispute this,
arguing that as gas prices rise in the future, international
collaboration on new nuclear stations could make further expansion a
possibility.

BERLIN: Distraught teenage girls have been flooding telephone hotlines
across Germany to talk through their trauma at seeing pop star Robbie
Williams quit Take That last week. The Berlin city government set up its
hotline after a 14-year-old girl tried to commit suicide on learning
that Williams would never play with the band again.
''One can best understand the emotional state of these girls if one
were to imagine Robbie Williams' departure from the band as the death of
a close relative,'' said Berlin youth Ingrid Stahmer, who said some
callers were in grave emotional distress.

Union, Tuesday
DAVID SMITH, the father of two boys drowned by their mother in a
country lake, broke down on the witness stand today as he told about the
night he learned his sons had been murdered.
''All my hopes, all my dreams, everything that I had planned for the
rest of my life came to an end that night -- and I didn't know what to
do,'' Smith told a packed court.
''Everything that I had planned on, my life with the kids, was gone.
And I didn't know how to handle it.''
Susan Smith, who was convicted on Saturday for murdering
three-year-old Michael and 14-month Alex, slumped over the defence table
and sobbed as her ex-husband spoke in a slow and anguished voice.
''I'm sorry, David,'' she told him as she was later led away.
Smith's two-hour appearance for the prosecution was so powerful that
it drew tears from jurors, courtroom spectators, and even members of the
press.
While still sobbing, David Smith came down from the witness and stood
before the witness box to show jurors nine photographs of his sons.
He later recounted the things he had looked forward to doing with
them: ''Teaching them how to play ball, taking them fishing, teaching
them to ride a bike, watching them go to school on their first day,
watching them grow up.
''All that's been ripped from me, and I don't know what I'm supposed
to do about it.''
For nine days last autumn, Smith stood by his ex-wife when she
maintained the boys had been abducted by a carjacker. She eventually
admitted to police that she had rolled her car into the lake with the
toddlers strapped inside.
The jury in Union, South Carolina, must now decide whether she should
be executed for her crime or face life in prison without the possibility
of parole for 30 years.

Paris, Tuesday
THE scene at the cafe Le Depart Saint-Michel today was straight out of
a nightmare.
The terrace of the corner bistro that should have been buzzing with
thirsty homeward-bound Parisians and idle tourists was packed instead
with the dazed and bloodied victims of a deadly bomb attack on the
adjacent Saint-Michel Metro station.
Four people were killed and 62 wounded in the blast.
Where the usual cafe crowd watch the world go by at the hub of the
French capital's bohemian Latin Quarter, people clutched dressings to
head wounds and gazed vacantly at their blood-stained clothes, lost in
shock.
The cafe was pressed into service as an emergency field hospital by
rescue workers hauling out the maimed and the merely shocked from among
hundreds of rush-hour commuters caught in the random bombing of an RER
underground train.
''Medics operated in the cafe, amputating one victim. There were 50 or
60 wounded people in the cafe,'' said owner Pascal Desbrandes.
''They were haggard. I thought of Sarajevo, of scenes of war. There
was one guy in rags who looked like somthing out of the Middle Ages. His
trousers were torn, his face and teeth black.''
Where bustling waiters normally flit between the tables, dishing out
cool beers and pastis on a balmy Paris evening, medics passed among the
wounded, checking for symptoms of serious injury.
Black-and-white-uniformed waiters wound their way among the rescue
workers, balancing trays of water to quench thirsts built up in the
smoky depths of the station, one of the city's biggest.
As the sun set over the River Seine, stretchers were carried from the
cafe, whisking away some of the most seriously hurt under thermal foil
to the city's intensive care units.
The bombing struck Paris in its historic heart. Tourists watched on
the Saint-Michel bridge as body bags came out and President Jacques
Chirac went down into the underground station.
Red fire service helicopters shuttled to and from the esplanade in
front of Notre Dame cathedral, the symbol of French Christianity since
the Middle Ages.
The Place Saint-Michel, whose fountain has been a lovers' tryst for
French youth for generations and a rally point in the 1968
student-worker riots, was jammed with ambulances and police vehicles.
Across the river stands the Prefecture, Paris' central police
headquarters, the law courts where big terrorism trials take place and
the Quai des Orfevres, home to the judicial police -- and Simenon's
fictional Inspector Maigret.
Many in the crowd that gathered behind police barricades were clearly
shocked, especially the tourists who throng this part of Paris.
However, for locals aware of the civil war burning across the
Mediterranean in former French Algeria, the biggest surprise was that it
had been nine years since the last bombing wave in Paris.--Reuter.

A HUSBAND and wife who systematically sexually abused a young girl
were jailed yesterday at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Andrew Milligan, 51, and his wife Jean, 44, subjected the child to
years of degradation during her visits.
Temporary judge Hazel Aronson, QC, sentenced Andrew Milligan to eight
years for his crimes against the youngster and a further six months'
imprisonment for breaching bail.
His wife was jailed for four years for the abuse and a further six
months for breaching bail.
The court was told the victim finally broke down in ''a display of
uncontrolled emotion'' in her own family home which led to police being
brought in.
The court heard that Jean Milligan had at first shown ''disgust'' when
she caught her husband carrying out indecent acts with the girl but
later joined in the sex offences.
The judge told Andrew Milligan: ''You have pled guilty to a systematic
catalogue of abuse of a young girl, beginning when she was only five and
a half and extending over a period of seven years. You subjected this
young girl to a degrading and damaging course of conduct.''
She told Jean Milligan: ''After the first incident you did apparently
nothing whatsoever to discourage your husband and indeed aided and
abetted him in his catalogue of abuse.''
The court heard the youngster was induced to strip naked to take part
in perverted sex sessions during which Andrew Milligan had shown her
pornographic magazines.
Milligan and his wife had committed sex acts with each other in front
of the girl and he had carried out other acts with the youngster which
culminated in him having intercourse with her when she was aged 12,
helped by his wife.
The girl was also induced to wear items of underwear they had bought
for her as ''a birthday present'' and to use a sex aid.
Advocate-depute Laurence Murphy told the court the victim had spent
breaks at the couple's former homes in Grangemouth, in Stirlingshire,
and Methil, in Fife, as a family friend of the childless Milligans.
He said a high degree of trust had been placed in the Milligans, but
added: ''Tragically that trust was misplaced.''
He said that a disgusted Jean Milligan slapped her husband's face when
she first caught him taking part in indecent acts with the girl.
But Mr Murphy added: ''Notwithstanding that from March 1988 she also
became involved in the systematic abuse of this child.''
The couple would play games of strip pontoon with the little girl
before going through to a bedroom to take part in sex sessions.
The Advocate-depute said that the victim, who is now a teenager, has
been left with feelings of guilt after her ordeal. He added: ''Nobody of
course can forsee the long-term effects this may have on her.''
Her ordeal came to light after the girl broke down in March last year
at her home and blurted out that Andrew Milligan had ''done it'' to her.
The Milligans, who married in 1984, were due to appear in the High
Court in Edinburgh earlier this year but did not show up. Warrants for
their arrest were issued and the couple were traced to Lincolnshire.
Defence counsel Ian Hamilton, QC, for Andrew Milligan said his client
was a first offender who now suffered from a heart condition and
diabetes.
He pointed out that no violence had been used in the crimes but added
that no adequate explanation for the behaviour could be offered.
Mr Gordon Jackson, QC, for Jean Milligan, said she also was a first
offender who had never been in any kind of trouble before.
She had not given any explanation for why she had become involved in
this ''monstrous'' behaviour.
The Milligans both admitted the sex offences and breaches of bail.

A WOMAN, who was given only six months to live when she was diagnosed
as a cancer sufferer, pledged to sue her local health trust last night
after she was given the all-clear.
Mrs Maureen Kinloch, 52, tried to commit suicide in the depths of
despair when she thought she had nothing to live for. However, nearly
two years after doctors told her she had terminal cancer of the spine,
she has been told there is no trace of the disease.
Mrs Kinloch said: ''I planted flowers in my garden and thought I'd
never see them come up. I wondered if I'd ever see my son get married
and have children.
''It's a strange feeling being able to make plans again and it's hard
to adjust to having a normal life.''
She added: ''I feel cheated. I've no faith in the health service any
more.''
Mrs Kinloch, of Brantwood Avenue, Dundee, collapsed in October 1993
after suffering back pains for weeks. She said: ''I was taken to Dundee
Royal Infirmary and given a scan. The doctors said I had cancer in my
spine and also brittle bones. I was told I only had six months to
live.''
She had to undergo radiotherapy treatment, which has left her with a
scarred gullet, and was also put on morphine to relieve her pain.
She also spent time at a hospice for the terminally ill in Dundee and
tried to end it all on Christmas Eve 1993.
She said: ''I just felt I was a burden to my family and they would be
better off without me. So I took a morphine overdose, but thankfully
that didn't work.''
But recently a bone scan was carried out on Mrs Kinloch, who is
confined to a wheelchair with brittle bones, which showed no sign of
cancer.
She explained: ''The tumour seemed to have disappeared and the doctors
said I'd been wrongly diagnosed.''
Now she says she will sue Dundee Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust on
grounds of medical negligence. She said: ''I'm bitter and angry that
I've wasted two years of my life. My son, James, had to drop out of
school because of the stress and there's been an incredible pressure on
the family.''
Her husband, Bill, 46, added: ''Everyone expects us to say we're
happy. But this never should have been allowed to happen.''
A spokesman for Dundee Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust refused to discuss
details of Mrs Kinloch's case on the grounds of ''patient
confidentiality''.
He added: ''Following discussion with a senior representative from
Dundee Teaching Hospitals, Mrs Kinloch is pleased that an investigation
into the facts of her case is being conducted.
''Mrs Kinloch has been advised that if she remains dissatisfied with
the action being taken on her behalf, she may request an independent
clinical review.''

THE Government called for more devolution from Brussels to the EU
member states yesterday, despite its own continuing refusal to cede more
power from Westminster to Scotland.
Mr David Davis, European Minister, said after talks in Brussels on
next year's inter-governmental conference (IGC) -- which will review the
Maastricht Treaty -- that the Government wants the formal conclusions on
''subsidiarity'' from the Edinburgh summit written into the treaty as a
protocol.
The conclusions refer to responsibilities in various areas in which
authority could be handed to EU member states by the European
Commission.
However, the Minister rejected calls from the Committee of the Regions
for authority to take member states which ignored the principle of
subsidiarity (Euro-jargon for devolving decision-making from Brussels to
member states) to the Court of Justice.
The Committee of the Regions, empowered only to give opinions to the
EU, supports subsidiarity and wants it established as the norm below
member state government level. It is also particularly critical of
Britain which is one of the most centralised EU states.
Mr Davis was speaking after two days of talks at the latest meeting of
the so-called EU Reflection Group of Ministers planning the agenda for
the IGC. Their findings will be the basis for the re-negotiation of
Maastricht and are expected to be made public before the Madrid summit
in December.
Mr Davis repeated the Government's line that the Maastricht talks
would not produce a ''great leap forward'' in European integration.
''There has been talk of it being a 5000-mile service or a dramatic
reform,'' he said. ''It seems the 5000-mile service will be the
outcome.''
He claimed there was support for British arguments in favour of more
deregulation and flexibility in controversial matters, such as the
single currency and the social chapter from which the UK has opt-outs.
This approach would create jobs which too much regulation destroyed,
he said. But he admitted some states, which he refused to identify, had
challenged this view.
''I responded moderately robustly,'' he commented.
Mr Davis said there was general agreement that there should be no new
competences for the EU and no new means of raising money. Britain also
wanted the so-called ''comitology'' system where committees effectively
make some minor laws -- which he described as the ''modern answer to the
number of angels on a pinhead'' -- to be amended so as to end
unnecessary secondary legislation.
There was no enthusiasm for the question of monetary union and the
proposed single European currency being put on the IGC agenda, he said.
Two people had spoken against Britain's opt-out from the social
chapter of Maastricht, Mr Davis confirmed. He refused to say if they
represented states or EU institutions. There was speculation France and
Belgium had demanded an end to Britain's opt-out.
The European Commission is also opposed to it along with the European
Parliament. However, Mr Davis insisted: ''The social chapter opt-out is
a non-negotiable point.''

AN Edinburgh Tourist Board computer is to be reprogrammed because it
directs lovers of fine architecture to Glasgow.
Three touch-screen displays offer visitors a range of attractions both
in Edinburgh and the rest of Scotland. However, the sole entry under
architectural buildings is Glasgow School of Art, designed by Charles
Rennie Mackintosh.
Mr Terry Levinthal, secretary of the Edinburgh heritage group, the
Cockburn Association, criticised the listing for failing to highlight
architectural treasures in the capital.
''It is not much use for a tourist in Edinburgh to be told the most
interesting architecture is in Glasgow,'' he said.
Miss Susan Boyle, head of visitor services for Edinburgh Tourist
Board, said it had an additional remit as a gateway authority to provide
information on other areas of Scotland.
''This is just one specific category for architecture. We have many
others which give comprehensive information on attractions in Edinburgh.
Rather than class Edinburgh Castle under architecture, it appears under
historic buildings.''
Last night, however, it was decided that the Glasgow school will be
reprogrammed under historic attractions.

EDINBURGH District Council signalled last night that it would like the
Government to take over responsibility for the Scott Monument because it
could not raise the #2m needed to repair it.
A newspaper report had claimed the local authority was willing to sell
the 200ft monument to the Government for #1 as a gift to the nation
because of the cost of repairing the stonework.
Councillor Steve Cardownie, convener of the council's recreation
committee, agreed last night that such an idea was being discussed. He
said: ''We are saying to the Scottish Office we don't have the money to
bring the Scott Monument up to standard in all its splendour but central
government would.
''Historic Scotland is responsible for a number of monuments
throughout Scotland and I hope they would have regard to the Scott
Monument as an additional valuable asset they could take over.
''The Scott Monument should be available for everybody to see and at
the moment it is not.''
A spokesman for Historic Scotland said no formal approach had been
made by the district council although informal discussions had taken
place.
Earlier, the council refused to confirm the #1 sale suggestion and
issued a statement emphasising that it was working closely with Historic
Scotland to ensure the refurbishment and repair of the monument.
Councillor Charles Booth, property services convener, said:
''Currently we are looking for an appropriate source of binny sandstone
to carry out necessary structural repairs. The estimate for the total
work required is #2m.''
Councillor Booth said that both the district council and Historic
Scotland considered the monument to be of national importance and felt
the financial burden should be shared nationally.
''We are therefore making a joint approach to the Lottery Heritage
Fund for financial support. We are also considering Historic Scotland
taking on the full responsibility for the future upkeep of this national
treasure,'' he said.
The Scott Monument was completed in 1846 at a total cost of #15,000.
Part of Princes Street was closed at the beginning of this year when
it was feared the monument was crumbling and had become a danger to the
public.
The council decided some years ago on a programme of cleaning and
restoration of the tourist landmark but both Historic Scotland and the
then Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, refused permission, saying that it
could damage the stonework.

A SURGEON criticised by a sheriff over the death of schoolgirl
Lorraine McGalliard faces a charge of serious professional misconduct by
the General Medical Council.
The GMC acted after Sheriff Laura Duncan passed it her findings on the
fatal accident inquiry into Lorraine's death in Stobhill Hospital,
Glasgow, two years ago.
The surgeon, Mr Robert Dalling, who was said in court to have
postponed an ultrasound scan which might have averted the girl's death,
could be admonished, suspended for up to 12 months, or struck off the
medical register if the allegation is found proven.
The case is expected to be heard later this year by the GMC's
professional conduct committee.
Lorraine's mother, May, welcomed the development, but questioned why
no action was being taken against four other doctors also criticised
during the inquiry last October.
The court heard that Lorraine, 14, of Waverley Crescent,
Kirkintilloch, had been admitted on the night of Saturday, September 11,
for the third time in six days, and after being discharged twice.
It had been thought that she was suffering from a urinary tract
infection, but she died from septic shock and multi-organ failure after
an ovarian cyst twisted and turned.
The inquiry was told that the girl was first sent to hospital by the
family's doctor, ''screaming in pain'' -- only to be discharged. On the
Sunday, after her re-admission, Mr Dalling had overruled an ultrasound
scan recommended by a junior doctor and put it off until the Monday, the
day Lorraine died.
The sheriff said: ''I was left feeling uneasy that Lorraine's case was
being held over to be dealt with during the ordinary working hours of
the week.''
Also criticised for a catalogue of errors were Dr Miriam Deeny,
surgeon Mr Matthew Calvert, Dr Stewart Ballantyne and registrar Mr
Dominic Byrne.
Mrs McGalliard said yesterday: ''It is right that Mr Dalling should
take his share of the blame, but I think the others should face the same
charges. He cancelled the ultrasound, but the others made errors leading
up to this and their part in it appears to be getting swept under the
carpet.''
Mrs McGalliard and her husband, John, are pursuing a legal action
against Greater Glasgow Health Board, which was responsible for Stobhill
at the time.

<TEXT>
THE current BT line rental is now fixed at a standard price of #24.79
per quarter (including VAT) -- an increase of 85% since the company was
privatised.
Over that period, the retail price index has risen by only 61.5%,
which explains why BT was criticised earlier this year when it added
#1.10 (or 4.6%) to rental costs.
However, the company points to a significant reduction in the cost of
calls since 1984. Indeed, it is currently obliged by Oftel to meet a
formula of cutting total bills by a rate of 7.5% less than the RPI.
Exactly how users will benefit from yesterday's announcement is not
yet clear, but it seems likely that customers who make a high volume of
calls will see their line rental cut.
Oftel said yesterday that more than 60% of residential customers
wanted a choice of billing arrangements, a move which will allow BT to
compete more aggressively with its cable TV rivals, who are wooing
around 50,000 users every month to their alternative phone supply.
Light users may see their rental cost actually increase, but have been
assured by both BT and Oftel that their overall bills will not rise.

A NEW era of variable telephone tariffs was signalled yesterday when
Oftel, the industry regulator, scrapped the restriction on BT's line
rental increases.
The decision, which theoretically allows BT to raise line rents by as
much as it wants, provoked some fears among consumer groups and
Opposition politicians, who claimed that poor and elderly users could
face large increases in their bills.
Later today, BT is expected to publish financial results, showing that
it made a profit of more than #810m -- more than #100 a second -- in the
three months to June.
However, Oftel director general Don Cruickshank insisted that
customers would, in general, benefit from the move, and guaranteed that
bills for low users would not rise faster than inflation.
He hoped the change would allow BT to be more flexible in the way it
bills users, and would ultimately bring industry prices down by
encouraging rival firms to compete for business.
''The constraint on increases in BT's line rental charges is, I think,
harming customers' interest more than it is helping them. It has meant
that BT has thought less imaginatively about meeting customers' needs.
''Customers will be better off with (the cap) removed. BT will be more
responsive and its competitors will be encouraged to invest faster and
with greater confidence.''
The new system should be in place by early next year, when BT is
expected to announce its next round of rent charges for its 20m domestic
and six million business lines.
BT said consumers would not face across-the-board line rent rises, but
would be given bills better suited to their circumstances. Officials
also said total bills would continue to fall, as call charges must be
cut further to meet regulatory demands.
At present, rival firms which use BT's lines have to make a
contribution to the cost of the network as they gain certain percentages
of the market. Under the proposed changes, rivals would no longer have
to make contributions, thus encouraging new companies to the market, and
BT would be given the ability to raise more cash by raising prices.
Rival provider Mercury welcomed the report, saying it recognised that
BT's dominance was a barrier to effective competition.
However, the National Consumer Council and the Consumers' Association
expressed worries about subscribers such as pensioners and the
unemployed who do not use the telephone enough to take advantage of cuts
in call charges.

MACAIR, Scotland's newest airline company, has crashed only weeks
after launching the first scheduled flights from Scotland to Londonderry
and Donegal.
The firm, founded by pilot John Maxton, went into interim liquidation
earlier this month, barely three months after its birth.
It is believed that crippling leasing costs for the two
Prestwick-built Jetstream 31 aircraft, which linked Birmingham and
London Stanstead with Edinburgh and the Irish airports, led to the
firm's demise. The 18-seater planes are thought to have been leased from
the Danish company Sun Air.
One of the jets has been impounded at Edinburgh Airport in lieu of
unpaid bills locally. The shutters have also been put up at the
airline's airport base.
Passenger numbers were thought regularly to exceed 50% on what was
viewed as a trailblazing move to open up the market to Northern
Ireland's second city and the golf courses of north-west Ireland.
The Edinburgh-based company's 26-strong staff, including 12 pilots and
seven cabin crew, learned of the firm's collapse at the end of June.
However, one airline source said Macair's future had been in doubt
since March.
''We didn't see how they were going to pay on a route to Derry. We
didn't reckon there would be much traffic between here and Derry,'' he
said.
Mr Maxton, a 37-year-old pilot who formerly worked with Loganair, said
earlier that the launch of his own airline was a dream come true.
He claimed it had taken him three years and #500,000 in funding,
including a chunk of his own money, to turn the dream into reality.
Last night, he was believed to be away from home in Kinross-shire on
business and could not be reached for comment.
Shadow Transport Minister Mr Henry McLeish said he was saddened by the
loss of the company. He said: ''Clearly this is very bad news indeed for
air travel because we are always being told we need competition. This
new company appears to have gone under because of punitive leasing
charges.''
''This is an area which should be examined closely by Scottish
Enterprise and the Government.''

<HEADLINE>New Museum of Scotland to get #7.25m from heritage fund. Kirk's 'no' to lottery cash questioned</HEADLINE>

THE new Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh is to benefit by #7.25m from
the National Lottery proceeds, it was announced last night.
The award is the second largest to come to Scotland from the Heritage
Lottery Fund (HLF), which previously gave #10.2m to the Mar Lodge
Appeal.
The announcement was made by Lord Rothschild, chairman of the National
Heritage Memorial Fund which allocates HLF monies, after a day-long
meeting with museum trustees.
Earlier yesterday, he re-opened the controversy over the Church of
Scotland's decision to refuse lottery funds and found an ally in the
minister of Glasgow Cathedral, the Rev Dr William Morris.
Lord Rothschild said he was disappointed by the Kirk's attitude,
pointing out that while 100 mainly Anglican churches had applied for
funds in England and Wales, fewer than 10 had applied in Scotland.
Dr Morris, one of Scotland's senior churchmen, questioned the Kirk's
stance, and said it was up to individual congregations to decide if they
wanted to apply for money.
The General Assembly voted to veto lottery money earlier this year,
but Dr Morris said if there was money available, he did not see any
reason why churches should not benefit.
In response, the Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the Kirk's board of
social responsibility, said the subject of lottery cash would be fully
discussed at next year's General Assembly. He said the assembly had been
particularly clear that the Kirk should not make an application to the
Millennium Fund.
''The millennium was a celebration of the birth of Christ and it would
be entirely inappropriate. At present, the Church does receive a fair
amount of money from the National Heritage Memorial Fund to restore
historic church buildings. On the basis of that the Church decided not
to apply to the Heritage Lottery Fund.''
Back in Edinburgh, Lord Rothschild said the new Museum of Scotland was
''an extremely exciting development and one we are glad to support''.
The new museum in Chambers Street is due to open in 1998, and is being
built through funding of #30m from the Scottish Office, with a further
#14m raised by the museum to fit it out.
Mr Mark Jones, director of the National Museums of Scotland, said he
was delighted with the award, which takes its appeal total to #12m.
''This has brought us within sight of the target needed to make this a
museum of excellence,'' he said.
Mr Jones said the museum was already popular with people from all
classes and the aim was to use new media to make it accessible all over
the country.
Lord Rothschild denied claims that some of the lottery heritage
allocations, including this week's #3m grant to the Scottish National
Gallery of Modern Art, were merely serving a cultural and monied elite.
''I would like to think that none of the things that we have done up
here has been elitist. I would hope that in the years to come every
schoolchild, student and tourist will visit the gallery.
''Edinburgh can really compete now with New York and Paris as a centre
for surrealist art and I think that is a cause for rejoicing,'' he
added.
The HLF yesterday announced 19 grants worth #11m for historic
buildings and museums across the UK, including two more in Scotland.
The Greyfriars Kirkyard Trust in Edinburgh will receive #11,800 to
allow it to draw up a detailed inventory of the famous graveyard. It is
hoped that the information gleaned about the 600 monuments will be used
in a conservation programme.
A grant of #202,315 was also awarded to West Lothian District Council
for the restoration of the Nasmyth Bridge in Almondell Country Park. The
nineteenth-century bridge partially collapsed in 1973.
Speaking earlier in Pollokshields Burgh Hall, the recipient of a
#400,000 award earlier this week, Lord Rothschild hinted that the fund
could be managed in a more organised manner, although he said he had had
no complaints from heritage charities.
Already #40m has been distributed with a further #150m in the kitty.
He said more than 50% of applicants had been successful and denied the
quality of application was poor. However, he said larger organisations
were better able to put applications together.
Lord Rothschild said lottery money could be allocated in batches next
year. ''We are thinking of a strategy (where) in addition to reacting to
specific applications, we will select specific themes such as church
heritage.''
He said there were also plans to carry out random checks on those
awarded grants.
Lord Rothschild said Scotland had done particularly well out of the
Heritage Lottery Fund having received #14.5m. This compared with only
#21m distributed by the National Heritage Memorial Fund over the last 15
years.
The largest cash sum announced yesterday, of #6.5m, went to the
Imperial War Museum in Duxford to build a major aviation centre,
including an American Air Museum. The fund also allocated #40,000
towards the excavation of an ancient elephant's skeleton embedded in the
North Norfolk cliffs.

A SCOTTISH rail union leader last night warned that the rail dispute
could flare up again, despite a decision to accept a provisional
settlement.
Leaders of the train drivers' union Aslef decided to suspend
tomorrow's threatened strike and ballot the union's 12,000 members after
a deal was reached which involved cutting the drivers' working week by
two hours from 1997.
However, Aslef's Scottish district secretary, Mr Pat O'Connor, warned
last night: ''I don't believe this dispute is actually over. I have been
in touch with many rail depots in Scotland today and the feeling is that
the offer will be completely unacceptable to our membership of 1400. I
believe these feelings will be reflected throughout the UK.
''The membership have said they are looking for a substantial rise
above the rate of inflation this year, not a cut in the working week by
two hours from 1997.''

THE first Scots baby, conceived with the aid of a new test-tube
technique which helps to overcome low sperm counts, is due to be born at
any time, staff at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital said yesterday.
The birth was awaited as the Government faced criticism for lack of
urgency over environmental pollutants suspected of causing male
infertility.
Ten Scots couples are now expecting babies as a result of
intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, which was introduced to
Scotland by doctors at Aberdeen last year.
ICSI entails injecting a single sperm into each egg retrieved from the
mother by normal IVF methods.
This gives sparse or weak sperm a much better chance of achieving
conception than conventional IVF, in which retrieved eggs swim in the
father's semen, among about 100,000 sperm, and letting nature take its
course before implanting the fertilised embryo.
Now the men attending Aberdeen's assisted conception unit for ICSI are
due to take part in a multi-centre trial aimed at finding out more about
the causes of low or weak sperm.
Employment history will be among the details being recorded.
Pesticides used in agriculture and chemical exposure in the oil industry
are among potential hazards of particular concern in the North-east.
Mrs Allison McTavish, nurse manager at the assisted conception unit,
said the first Scotswoman to become pregnant using this method was due
to give birth yesterday, though her baby was clearly in no hurry.
''A second woman who became pregnant last year is also due to give
birth in a couple of weeks and eight other women helped by ICSI are also
pregnant,'' she added.
ICSI uses a glass needle a fraction of a human hair in diameter to
capture each sperm and penetrate the egg wall.
The Department of the Environment pledged yesterday to act over
''gender-bending'' man-made chemicals which may alter sexual
characteristics -- but only when scientists prove beyond doubt they are
harming humans.

CLAN passions are set to rise again as a result of a comment by the
Duke of Argyll that the Battle of Culloden provided a good result for
Scotland.
However, the duke, whose Campbell ancestors supported the Hanoverians
at Culloden, is angry because he says the interview he gave for a
television programme, Highlanders, to be seen on the ITV network on
Sunday, was cut.
In the interview he also says he does not believe that Prince Charles
Edward Stuart would have been a good monarch for Britain.
The duke's old friend and neighbour, war hero Sir Fitzroy Maclean, was
a consultant on the programme, made by Grampian Television, but is not
happy with the end result.
Speaking at his Inveraray Castle home in Argyll, the duke said: ''I
expressed many more views which have been cut from the programme. While
I said that Culloden provided a good result for Scotland, I also said
that I was deeply saddened by the loss of gallant men on both sides.
''If you round that up, it sounds an awful lot better than saying the
Duke of Argyll was delighted with the slaughter at Culloden.''
Sir Fitzroy, who lives within sight of Inveraray Castle, speaks out on
behalf of Prince Charlie and says he might well have proved a good king.
Lord Lovat, an ancestor of Lady Maclean, was beheaded because he gave
hospitality to the prince.
The Duke added: ''Both Sir Fitzroy and Lady Maclean are very good
friends of mine. I know that, after he was retained as consultant on the
programme, they did not pay one bit of attention to what he said and he
is very, very angry about it.''
Sir Fitzroy was away on business but Lady Maclean said: ''I am glad
the duke has spoken out the way he has. I do not wish to add anything to
what he has said.''
The programme was made to mark the 250th anniversary of the start of
the Jacobite uprising last Sunday.
Mr Michael Gill, freelance director of Highlanders, said: ''I can
sympathise with the Duke of Argyll's comments. Unfortunately, we had to
cut a great deal of material. Originally there should have been four
one-hour programmes. This was reduced to one-and-a-half hours, then to
one hour.
''We endeavoured to keep as much as we could from the duke's interview
in the version that will be shown on Sunday.''
He said they had endeavoured to balance the duke's views by cutting
out a section dealing with the swords that were taken from the dead
Jacobites by the Duke of Cumberland, then used as a garden fence in
England.
''These were later brought back to Inveraray Castle and put on display
by another Campbell,'' said Mr Gill.

Our Foreign Staff
BOSNIAN Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his army commander, General
Ratko Mladic, were yesterday charged with war crimes, genocide, and
crimes against humanity by the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal.
As the tribunal in The Hague was indicting the Serbs, Zepa, another UN
''safe area'', appeared to have fallen to their forces, and a British
Sea King helicopter was hit flying near Sarajevo.
The helicopter was on a UN mission over Mount Igman. It was hit in the
fuselage by small arms fire. No one was injured and it returned safely
to base.
The aircraft with two crew on board from the Royal Navy's 845 Squadron
based in Split was on ''general duties'' when it came under fire. It was
unclear whether the attack came from Bosnian Serb troops or Bosnian
government forces, making any sort of retaliation difficult to target.
The tribunal said the war crime charges arose ''from atrocities
perpetrated against the civilian population throughout
Bosnia-Herzegovina, for the sniping campaign against civilians in
Sarajevo, and for the taking of UN peacekeepers as hostages and their
use as human shields.''
Tribunal documents also indicted Milan Martic, president of the
Croatian Serb administration in Knin, and 21 others. Martic is charged
with war crimes in connection with firing cluster bombs into Zagreb.
The 21 others indicted are charged with crimes committed in the Luka
and Keraterm prison camps in Bosnia and the northern Bosnian region of
Bosanski Sanac.
UN human rights envoy Tadeusz Mazowiecki said yesterday 7000 people
were missing after Bosnian Serbs captured the Muslim enclave of
Srebrenica two weeks ago amid acts of ''barbarism''.
''We are sure that a number of them have been summarily executed by
the Serbs. For the others, we fear the worst,'' he said.
He said he would publish his report on the events in the UN ''safe
area'' today in Geneva. The Bosnian Serbs have denied the atrocities.
The former Polish Prime Minister said: ''We can talk in terms of
barbarism. The witnesses we interviewed were clearly credible. One
refugee told us he had seen a Serb militiaman walking around one village
in the enclave with a head and the limbs of a woman in his arms.''
He said all the testimonies would be passed on to the Hague tribunal.
The UN, meanwhile, rushed a team of negotiators to the embattled
eastern Muslim enclave of Zepa following word that its defenders had
agreed to surrender to the Bosnian Serbs.
Under terms of the reported agreement, the local defenders promised to
relinquish their equipment and weapons to UN control, clear all road
mines and allow women, children, the elderly, sick and wounded to leave,
UN officials said.
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajzdic, however, said weapons would
not be turned over to the UN until first civilians, then Zepa's men,
were safely evacuated.
Under a Bosnian Serb ultimatum outlined last week, all men in Zepa
were to be detained, allegedly for future prisoner-of-war exchanges. But
there were serious concerns for their safety following the events at
Srebrenica.
The UN said women and children at Zepa had been fleeing into the
woods. UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Vernon said in Sarajevo:
''Bosnian Serb soldiers are moving through Zepa with impunity.''
The Bosnian government army, although confirming its soldiers had
abandoned the town, said its troops were taking up positions in the
hills, Bosnian state radio reported.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke is preparing to backtrack on his sweeping
taxation change on share option schemes, announced only nine days ago.
Treasury officials were yesterday seeking a way to distinguish
industry's ''fat cats'' from ordinary shareholding employees.
Mr Clarke is expected to report to the Prime Minister today on the
furore caused by his announcement that all profits on share option
schemes would be taxed as income rather than capital gains. It put the
massively-paid directors of privatised services in the same bracket as
Asda check-out workers.
The Chancellor, campaigning at the Littleborough and Saddleworth
by-election, said he was prepared to listen to ''sensible views'' on the
subject of share options. ''I see no reason why businessmen shouldn't be
rewarded like football players or pop stars. They should be taxed
sensibly and I am prepared to look at any sensible options.''
Labour claimed he was set for his second U-turn on the issue.
Mr Major and Mr Clarke are expected to discuss the issue on the
sidelines of the Cabinet meeting today. They are in no doubt about the
views of Cabinet colleagues that a decision cannot wait for the
Chancellor's November Budget.
The Chancellor's financial secretary, Mr Michael Jack, had meetings
yesterday with the Sir Richard Greenbury inquiry team on directors' pay
and members of the Institute of Directors.
Later, Sir Richard, Marks &amp; Spencer chairman, restated the
recommendation of his inquiry committee set up by the CBI: executive
share option schemes should no longer receive favoured tax treatment
compared with other forms of long-term incentive schemes.
''This recommendation was intended to apply to directors and senior
executives. The committee emphasised in the report that its proposals
excluded SAYE (Save As You Earn) or other schemes which are available to
all, or substantially all, employees.''
Last week, Sir Richard appeared to be backtracking on his committee's
recommendations in evidence to the Commons Treasury Select Committee. It
caused the Chancellor acute embarrassment because he, immediately, in a
dawn statement accepted the recommendation stating that tax changes
would apply retrospectively. When leading Tory back benchers discovered
that the changes applied to ordinary share option holders, they were
outraged.
Yesterday Sir Richard emphasised that his committee's brief was on
directors' pay only. The intricacies of taxation details are a matter
for the Chancellor alone, he said.
Mr Clarke, for his part, insisted that most people who enjoy executive
share options are not low-paid.
However, both he and Mr Major have still to address the matter of
employee share options which were conceived by the Tories as a work
incentive and a realistic quotient of pay. Workers would do better when
their companies are prospering and less so when they are not. If their
share options are to be taxed on income rather than capital gains, this
incentive could be lost.
Mr David Shaw, vice-chairman of the Tory back-bench finance committee
is due to meet Mr Jack today to discuss how ordinary workers can be
excluded from the measures.
He said the situation could be helped if income tax liability for low
earners was payable only when the shares were sold. ''If this is fatally
flawed, as it appears to be, we should have the guts to withdraw it.''
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown accused the Chancellor of failing to
look at the fine print and the detail of the Greenbury report. ''What
happened was, he was forced into a U-turn at 6am on Monday morning just
over a week ago and from his comments this morning it is clear that he
is considering another U-turn.''
0 An early test of the Greenbury recommendations came yesterday at an
annual general meeting of Norweb. Ordinary shareholders, about 500 of
whom were present, attempted to cut the three-year contracts for the
directors of the Manchester-based electricity company to one year in
line with the recommendations. They were thwarted by the directors and
big institutional shareholders in a narrow vote.

<HEADLINE>Four die in Paris bomb blast. Four killed in Paris Metro bomb blast</HEADLINE>

FOUR people were killed and at least 62 wounded when a bomb exploded
in a rush-hour underground train in a Paris Metro station yesterday.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe went to the scene where, visibly shaken, he
told reporters: ''There are very strong suspicions that it was a
terrorist attack.''
President Jacques Chirac, who when he took office in May embarked on a
robust foreign and nuclear policy that has made him numerous enemies,
consoled the wounded but made no public comment.
Witnesses said the bomb exploded in one carriage of the south-bound
RER suburban rapid transit system at the Saint-Michel station beside
Notre Dame cathedral.
''All the windows were blown out. It was a scene of horror,'' one
passenger said.
Four of the wounded had limbs amputated by emergency medical services
at a makeshift field hospital set up in a cafe outside the Metro
station, on the left bank of the river Seine.
''It's carnage down there,'' a fireman told reporters on emerging from
the station.
Some of the most seriously injured were evacuated by helicopters which
took off and landed on the forecourt of the gothic cathedral.
Police sealed off the area, causing traffic chaos. Many commuters were
stranded because the main north-south underground RER line was closed.
It was not expected to reopen until today at the earliest.
No-one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast. The Paris
public prosecutor's office sent anti-terrorist magistrates to the scene,
along with detectives and forensic experts.
A spokesman for the Paris fire service said 10 of the wounded were in
a very serious condition.
The blast occurred on the RER-B southbound line to the suburb of
Saint-Remy-les-Chevreuse. Lieutenant-Colonel Daniel Grangier, of the
Paris fire service, told reporters the explosion in one carriage had
started a fire which had been extinguished.
The station is a junction point between the urban Metro underground
railway and the RER.
The last time a serious wave of bomb attacks hit Paris was in 1986
when the conservative Mr Chirac was Prime Minister. Those bombings were
blamed on pro-Iranian Lebanese extremists trying to pressure France into
stopping its arms supplies to Iraq.
France's armed forces chief of staff, Admiral Jacques Lanxade, said in
a television interview it was too early to speculate who might be behind
the bombing but he hoped it was an isolated incident.
However, for months before the attack authorities had feared acts of
violence linked to Algeria's bloody civil strife.
But the bombing still came as a surprise, sowing death at random in
the midst of a busy commuter and tourist centre in the very heart of the
French capital, security officials said.
Justice and intelligence sources, while stressing caution, said
Algerian extremists were top of the list of suspects.
Other possible trails included Middle Eastern extremists, such as
supporters of the international guerrilla Carlos, captured by French
agents in Sudan last year, or Serbs angered by President Chirac's robust
advocacy of stronger international military action in Bosnia.
Another theory was that the explosion might even be linked to a
planned visit to Paris by Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman
Yasser Arafat, although police discounted that as improbable.
''Even if no one claims it, we may be able to pin it on one movement
or another by examining the explosives and the mechanism of the
device,'' a spokesman for the Paris public prosecutor's office said. The
blast occurred just two weeks after gunmen shot dead one of the founders
of Algeria's outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Sheikh Abdelbaki
Sahraoui, at the Paris mosque where he settled after the army intervened
to cancel general elections in the North African state in 1992.
French investigators are still puzzling over whether the rival
extremist Armed Islamic Group (GIA), or Algeria's feared military
security service was responsible.
It was the first attack to bring Algeria's civil war, which has
claimed more than 40,000 lives in three years, on to French soil.
An Algerian newspaper believed closely tied to military intelligence,
La Tribune, reported threats of attacks in France by the GIA on July 17.
Its detailed account said a five-man unit had infiltrated France via
Bosnia to kill Sheikh Sahraoui and another exiled Algerian activist in
France, and commit bomb attacks ''to punish the French government''. --

SCOTRAIL will continue running the controversial Fort William sleeper
six days a week throughout the winter by combining it with the Inverness
and Aberdeen services, a compromise which it is hoped will provide the
basis for its long-term survival.
It will, meanwhile, satisfy Highland Regional Council which won an
interdict against ScotRail withdrawing the service before there had been
full public consultation.
The council met representatives of the Highland business community and
rail campaigners at a private meeting in Spean Bridge last night to
outline ScotRail's proposals.
It is believed the new winter service will start on September 23 with
bookings being taken from August 1. Earlier speculation that it would
operate only three days a week is unfounded.
The Aberdeen section of the combined train will have six sleeper cars;
Inverness five; with one for Fort William. This will be increased to two
on Fridays and Sundays to cater for skiers heading north from London.
The train will divide/join up at Edinburgh as the Fort William and
Inverness sections have already been doing during the winter timetables.
By adding the Aberdeen section it will mean that there can be
substantial savings, reducing significantly the #2.6m ScotRail says it
costs to run the threatened Fort William service.
One person who attended last night's meeting told The Herald: ''There
might be a few difficulties with arrival times in the winter but at
least it offers some way forward and the chance to save the sleeper in
the long term.''
The initiative follows a flurry of political activity in the last
week. Last Wednesday, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth met Transport
Secretary Sir George Young, BR chairman John Welsby and ScotRail
director John Ellis.
On the same day, Mr Forsyth met the rail franchise director, Mr Roger
Salmon. On Friday, Mr Forsyth invited the convener of Highland Regional
Council, Mr Duncan McPherson, to St Andrew's House for talks while Mr
Ellis headed north on Monday to meet Highland Regionional Council.
All the effort is being directed at persuading Mr Salmon that the
proposal represents a material change to the economics of the Fort
William sleeper, the service he described as ''disproportionately
uneconomic'' when he announced on December 14 that it would not be
included in his draft Passenger Service Requirement for ScotRail.
If that were confirmed in the final PSR, it would mean no subsidy and
consequently no service.
Hopes are now growing in the Highlands that the region's campaign, Mr
Forsyth's intervention and this new winter timetable might give Mr
Salmon the additional flexibility he needs to include a more cost
effective service in the PSR.
