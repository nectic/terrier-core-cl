Sarajevo
ADMIRAL Leighton Smith, the American commander of Nato's 60,000-strong
Implementation Force for Bosnia, took charge of Ifor's temporary headquarters
in Croatia as his troops finally started pouring into the area in earnest.
``I guess I'm kind of excited. I think it's an enormously complicated operation
and one that has great hopes. I'm excited about the prospect of peace in former
Yugoslavia, in Bosnia,'' he told reporters in Zagreb.
``Right now my biggest concern is getting forces in place and getting this
thing started. There seems to be a good start right now in that we seem to see
a continuation in the cessation of hostilities,'' he added.
The US airlifted its first combat troops to Bosnia today after the weather
finally cleared.
Smith dismissed worries about mounting Nato's most ambitious operation in the
depths of the Balkan winter.
He said deploying the multi-national force now would have his troops well
placed to provide security in the region once the weather did start to improve
- traditionally the fighting season.
Giant American transport planes brought troops and supplies to a north-east
Bosnia base today after a blanket of fog lifted enough to allow Task Force
Eagle to start landing.
The first US combat troops to fly into Bosnia were paratroopers from the 325th
Infantry Airborne Control Team who will secure the Tuzla base after Swedish UN
soldiers formally hand it over on Wednesday.
The planes also dropped off air control equipment which should make it easier
for planes to fly in all weathers.
By late afternoon, at least a dozen planes had flown from bases in Germany and
Italy into Tuzla. The huge C-130 Hercules transports discharged troops,
vehicles, and supplies for the advance guard of the 20,000 Americans and US Air
Force officials hoped to average 20 planes a day.
In Croatia, the first US troops to reach former Yugoslavia, who arrived by
train yesterday, were due to start replacing a wrecked bridge over the border
Sava river to enable thousands of others to follow into Bosnia.
As the American presence was growing, the first Russians of a 4000-strong
contingent in the 60,000-strong Ifor arrived in Belgrade en route to Tuzla and
Sarajevo. It will be the first time US and Russian troops have soldiered
together on a potential combat mission since the Seond World War.
The British contingent, meanwhile, was concerned about what to do if they met
an accused war criminal.
Brigadier Richard Dannatt, commander of UN peacekeepers who will lead the bulk
of the British forces when Ifor takes over, said he would not know how to treat
a war-crime suspect - such as Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his army
general, Ratko Mladic.
The UN war crimes tribunal stipulates that UN member states are obliged to
arrest any suspects. Brigadier Dannatt has asked what he should do in such a
case.
``I have not yet had a reply but I am confident it will be answered in good
time, before the transfer of authority,'' he said.-Reuter.

THREE Royal Navy vessels sold to a British company with a Spanish connection
are to be refitted in Spain before being sent north to start fishing in
Scotland's waters.
They will use quotas intended for Britain's hard-pressed fishermen.
The three 118ft-long sister ships were built as trawlers and were originally
based at Grimsby, but have not gone fishing since they were bought by the
Ministry of Defence in the early 1980s for use in gunnery practice.
Yesterday Mr Bill Brown, a director of Hooktone Ltd, confirmed that his company
has bought the vessels from the MoD. He said: ``Two are in Spain, being
refitted, and one is still in Portsmouth. When the work is completed they will
be registered in Scotland, with Ardrossan as their home base.''
Mr Brown said that the vessels, known by the Navy as Bullseye, Magpie and
Targe, were an ideal size for fishing waters out to the west of Scotland,
England and France. He added: ``These boats are British, because this is a
British company.''
Hooktone's managing director is Spanish-born Mr Ricardo Hermida, who is now a
British citizen and has a home in Ayr, and four other members of the family are
principal shareholders. Mr Hermida was unavailable for comment yesterday.
The company, which is currently advertising in the trade press to buy licences
from British skippers, acts as agents for a fleet of about 30 large boats which
regularly land their catches in Spain.
A spokesperson for the MoD said: ``There are guidelines covering how and what
we sell and to whom. These ships were sold earlier this year to a British
company, and we have no problem with the sale.''
Neither Hooktone nor the MoD would reveal how much the deal was worth.
Mrs Winnie Ewing, the Euro-MP for the Highlands and Islands, said yesterday:
``The whole thing is an absolute scandal. Bit by bit we see the Spaniards
getting on to our register and therefore getting at our quota. There has been a
series of incredible deliberate sell-outs of our industry in the wheeling and
dealing in Europe.''

TWO men wanted for extradition to Britain for escaping from Brixton prison were
freed on bail by the High Court in Dublin yesterday.
Nessan Quinlivan and Pearse McCauley were released on bail of #70,000 each.
Mr Justice Dermot Kinlen ordered that Quinlivan should live at his family home
in Limerick and sign on daily at the local police station.
He ordered that McCauley should live with the relatives of his fiancee in
Tipperary, and also sign on daily at a police station.
The Dublin District Court ordered their extradition to Britain last week on
charges alleging they escaped from Brixton prison.
Quinlivan, 30, from Ballynanty Beg, Limerick, and McCauley, 31, from Strabane,
County Tyrone, are both wanted on charges of escaping in July 1991.
The two men were freed from Portlaoise Prison last month but seconds after they
walked free, they were arrested on four extradition warrants.
q.Three men on the run from the Maze prison in Northern Ireland were yesterday
given bail by a San Francisco judge.
Kevin Artt, Paul Brennan, and Terence Kirby were arrested in California between
1992 and 1994. They now face an extradition hearing in June.
q.Former United States   senator George Mitchell last night stressed his
international team of commissioners investigating the arms issue of the
Northern Ireland peace process had reached no decisions after four days of
talks in both Belfast and Dublin.
The three-man body - also including ex-Finnish premier Harri Holkeri and
Canadian defence chief General John de Chastelain - yesterday saw Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams and senior party colleagues as well as later deputy Irish
premier Dick Spring and Justice Minister Nora Owen.
Submissions were later presented by Ireland's main opposition party Fianna Fail
and the leaders of the two biggest churches, Catholic Primate Cardinal Cahal
Daly and Church of Ireland Archbishop Robin Eames.
Irish police commissioner Patrick Culligan also saw the international panel,
facing possible questioning over the amount of terrorist arms suspected to be
hidden in secret caches on the southern side of the Irish border.
As he left Dublin last night, Mr Mitchell said his four days of discussions had
been ``candid and straightforward'' and provided his team with a great deal of
information.
He added: ``We are learning a great deal about this complex issue. We will
return to Belfast and Dublin in January to continue our work.''
Mr Mitchell and his colleagues were appointed by the British and Irish
Governments to examine the arms dimension that has proved an impasse to the
peace process.
Britain has insisted that the IRA move towards decommissioning their weapons
ahead of an entry by their Sinn Fein allies into all-party talks about the
future of Northern Ireland.
Yesterday's developments marked the latest stage in an intensive sequence of
pre-Christmas political moves centring on the still-fragile peace process.
Mr Adams will today see Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, in
Belfast. Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour leader John Hume will
meet also members of the Dublin Government.
Sir Patrick yesterday held discussions with Northern Ireland's two Unionist
parties and the Alliance Party.
q.A man was shot dead last night outside a chip shop in the New Lodge Road area
of Belfast. Two gunmen burst in through the back door of the shop in Lepper
Street and shot their victim several times, hitting him in the chest, arm, and
leg.
He was taken to the nearby Mater Hospital but died soon afterwards. The victim,
aged around 40, was believed to have been known to the security forces before
the ceasefire as an active republican. No-one has claimed responsibility and
police have not found a motive.

THE older brother of Scots boxer James Murray was said to be ``making good
progress'' yesterday after undergoing brain surgery in the hospital where Mr
Murray died two months ago.
The Newmains family's torment over the death of their second son was renewed
when David, 27, was taken to Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, following an
operation at Law Hospital three weeks ago to remove a growth from his ear.
After his transfer to the Southern's Institute for Neurological Sciences,
surgeons operated to remove an abcess from his brain.
James, 25, died at the institute after being knocked out in a British
bantamweight title fight against Drew Docherty in Glasgow on October 13.
David and the family's youngest son Roddy, 22, supported their father a few
days after the tragedy when he publicly absolved James's opponent of any blame
for his death, declaring that Mr Docherty would be welcome at any time in their
house.
The pall of fear that fell on the house soon after that as a result of David's
illness had eased yesterday when it became clear he would probably be home in a
fortnight.
Describing her relief, his mother, Margaret, 53, said: ``Davy is fine now but
we couldn't believe it when it happened. It was a nightmare. I thought the
dreadful tragedy in our lives had started again.''
Mrs Murray, who also has a daughter Janie, 20, said David was now regaining his
strength and was cheerful.
``He wasn't eating and I knew that something was wrong with him,'' she
recalled. ``He had a bit of an infection in his ear and it caused an abcess.''
Then the surgeons told her that they wanted to operate immediately to cut away
the tissue. She said: ``I thought it had started again. I was getting really
worried. It has been a terrible year for the whole family.''

Three months for
Branson break-in
A MAN was jailed for three months at Rothesay Sheriff Court yesterday for
breaking into the home of Virgin boss Richard Branson's cousin and causing more
than #6000 worth of damage.
Gordon Patrick, 22, of Braid Park Drive, Giffnock, Glasgow, admitted smashing
92 panes of glass in the house on Inchmarnock island owned by Mr and Mrs Ian
Branson. He was also ordered to pay #600 compensation. A second man, Alistair
McLean, 25, of Castlehill Drive, Newton Mearns, was fined #450 for stealing two
chairs from the property and using them to start a beachside barbecue.
Homicide charge
A FIFE teenager appeared in private at Cupar Sheriff Court yesterday charged
with the culpable homicide of Mr Derek Walker, 24, in Anstruther on Saturday
night. Alexander Anderson, 17, of Waid Terrace, Anstruther, made no plea or
declaration and was remanded in custody.
House fire death
A FIVE-year-old boy died yesterday after a candle apparently set fire to his
bedroom. Mrs Claudia Miller, 37, is being treated for burns and smoke
inhalation after failing to save her son Peter from the fire at their
semi-detached home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. She escaped with her four
other children.
Culloden exhibits
EVENTS marking next year's 250th anniversary of Culloden are expected to
attract a record number of visitors. The National Trust for Scotland expects
300,000 people to see its Sword And The Sorrows exhibition of private artefacts
and memorabilia at the battlefield visitor centre between April 16 and
September 20.
Message missed
FESTIVE tipplers are failing to heed the anti-drink-drive message of Highland
Police. Last week's figures show 18 arrests for drink-driving, two up on the
same period last year.
Road victims
TWO pensioners and a schoolgirl died yesterday after being injured in road
accidents: Mr Alexander Smith, 85, of Alloa, Clackmannanshire, who was hit by a
car on December 11; Kay McCormack, 9, who was knocked down in Blackburn, West
Lothian, at the weekend; and Mrs Margaret Richardson, 82, of North Berwick,
from injuries suffered in an accident in East Lothian on December 5.
Teed off
THE new captain of Nairn Dunbar Golf Club, Mr Hamish Bunker, 45, is used to
hearing jokes about his name. ``I once tried to join the works golf club,'' he
said. ``But the secretary tore up my application - he thought it was a
practical joke . . . I've heard all the quips but, unlike my club colleagues, I
don't spend much time in those things I call sandtraps.''

SCOTTISH emergency planners have been put on alert for the Chinese spy
satellite capsule which is due to crash at an unknown site next month.
It emerged yesterday that Scottish Office officials from the Emergency Planning
Division have written to all local authorities, chief constables, and fire
chiefs warning of the ``potential threat'' posed by the two-ton module. Space
experts warn the capsule could crash at several hundred miles an hour and do as
much damage as a small bomb.
The Scottish Office says in a letter that the satellite capsule, part of a
recoverable photo-reconnaissance satellite which went out of control and
crashed into the South Pacific in 1993, had been due to re-enter the earth's
atmosphere in July. However, the latest information from both Ministry of
Defence space monitoring stations and the US Space Command points to a landing
early in the new year.
The capsule, cone shaped and about 1.5 metres long, contains camera and film
espionage equipment which the Americans hope to recover if it makes a ``soft''
landing, does not burn up on re-entry, or if the capsule's parachute opens.
The Scottish Office said: ``There is a possibility, albeit very small, that the
re-entry module could impact on UK territory.''
In the information bulletin given to local authorities, officials also reveal
that experts will be able to guess where the capsule will land less than an
hour before the event.
``Even an hour before impact, with an uncertainty of around five minutes, the
satellite would sweep a ground track some 2000km in length.''
A Home Office spokeswoman said a similiar warning had been issued to English
emergency services in October.

AROUND 40% of children in some parts of Scotland do not own a toothbrush, it
was revealed yesterday as the Government announced an injection of new money to
tackle the country's poor record of dental health.
Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton described the statistic
that 62% of five-year-olds had tooth decay and there were signs the situation
was deteriorating as ``appalling'', adding: ``This is a sad indictment on the
lifestyles and habits of our children.''
Scotland, he said, was regrettably way down the UK dental health league table
and the root problem was down to ``a notoriously bad diet and in particular our
love of all things sweet''.
The Minister was launching the Oral Health Strategy for Scotland which
indicated west central Scotland had the highest levels of decay.
He announced funding totalling more than #250,000 for new dental initiatives to
tackle dental problems. He said dental and oral health was an essential
component of good health but for too long people had failed to appreciate the
contribution it could make to their general well-being.
The number of five-year-olds presently with tooth decay was the reason for the
high priority being given to getting the message over to them and those who
cared for them.
A policy statement in 1992, Scotland's Health - A Challenge To Us All,
undertook that a national dental strategy would be produced to help achieve
targets for improvement in oral and dental health. These targets were now being
extended in line with World Health Organisation goals.
By the year 2005, 12-year-olds should have on average no more than 1.5 teeth
decayed, missing, or filled. By 2008, 90% of 18-year-olds should have all their
own teeth and at least 80% of adults between 35 and 44 should have a minimum of
21 teeth.
Lord James said the strategy, addressing dental decay, periodontal disease,
derangement of oral facial tissues, and oral cancers, was the product of
extensive consultation with a broad range of dental interests.
He said: ``Diet, health promotion, the use of fluoride, self-help, and
prevention are identified as being the key areas on which action should be
centred if progress towards the targets is to be made.''
He said the Scottish Office, which maintained the fluoridation of public water
supplies, the single most effective public health measure against decay, would
be offering ``pump-priming funding'' to encourage original and innovative
proposals to achieve real improvements.
``Some #113,000 has already been allocated to oral health projects and a
further #250,000 will be earmarked in 1996-97. The allocation of further funds
will be considered if a particularly large number of very strong applications
are received.''

CHINOOK helicopters suffered computer malfunctions and an engine ``flame out''
just weeks before the same type of aircraft crashed on Mull of Kintyre, killing
29 people, a preliminary fatal accident inquiry hearing was told yesterday.
Tests on the Mark II helicopters were suspended after the incidents last year
but the RAF continued to fly the aircraft, Paisley Sheriff Court heard.
Yesterday's procedural hearing precedes the full inquiry, which starts on
January 8.
A Chinook was en route from Northern Ireland to a security conference at Fort
George, Inverness-shire, when it crashed in heavy fog on the southern tip of
Mull of Kintyre on June 2 last year, killing everyone on board. The victims
included anti-terrorist officers from the RUC special branch, Army intelligence
and MI5, as well as the four-man RAF crew.
The court heard yesterday that the helicopter pilot, Flight Lieutenant Jonathan
Tapper, 28, and co-pilot, Flight Lieutenant Richard Cook, 30, had been blamed
for the crash.
However, Mr Aidan O'Neill, a lawyer representing the family of Mr Tapper,
raised allegations about the malfunctions. He said they were contained in a
letter to the Scottish Office from Colonel Hodgkiss, an officer at the Boscombe
Down air testing base in Wiltshire.
He said tests on the helicopters had been suspended after the engine ``flame
out'' in March and five computer faults. They resumed after an investigation,
six weeks before the fatal crash.
Mr O'Neill called on the Ministry of Defence to provide more information about
the incidents and those involved.
Mr John Mitchell QC, acting for the Crown, said background evidence about the
previous faults was not directly relevant to the hearing.
The inquiry also heard that the widows of the crewmen had not been granted
funding from the MoD for legal representation to clear their husbands' names.
Mr O'Neill said he would test the evidence presented to establish if the claims
of pilot error were substantiated.
More than 47 witnesses are expected to give evidence to the inquiry, which is
due to last four weeks.
Sheriff Sir Stephen Young turned down a motion to appoint an expert adviser for
the court. He adjourned the hearing, which also heard the views of lawyers
representing the MoD, the family's of other victims, and aircraft company
Boeing.
q A summary of the Defence Ministry's air accident investigation, published in
June this year, said the pilots wrongly continued to fly towards high ground in
thick fog below a safe altitude. This constituted ``a failure in their duty to
operate the aircraft safely''. It had therefore been concluded, regrettably,
that both pilots had been negligent.
The accident report said navigation equipment had been functioning accurately
and there was no evidence of ``catastrophic'' mechanical problems such as
gearbox, engine or rotor-blade failure.
Sabotage and speculation that electronic interference from a portable phone
might have affected the aircraft's navigation instruments were also ruled out.

A POLICEMAN who was accused of banging a woman's head against the door of a
patrol car while he was arresting her, walked free from court yesterday after
the case against him was found not proven.
Constable Graham Howie, 31, was alleged to have assaulted Miss Sarah-Jayne
Devlin, 24, by repeatedly striking her head on the car during an early morning
incident at a taxi rank.
In evidence at an earlier court, Miss Devlin, a receptionist, said she felt an
arm around her neck after she became involved in a pushing and shouting match
with another woman. She told the court she was thrown to the ground after
Constable Howie had dragged her backwards across a road.
Miss Devlin added: ``Then my head was banged off the side of the car about
three times.''
However, the court was told yesterday by Constable John Clunie that his
colleague had restrained the ``struggling'' woman and that the pair had
``either fallen or tripped'' on to the ground as she was taken towards the
police car.
Yesterday, at the conclusion of a three-day trial at Perth Sheriff Court,
Sheriff David Sutherland found the assault charge against Constable Howie not
proven, explaining that the Crown had failed to prove the case beyond
reasonable doubt.
Constable Howie, whose address was given as c/o Tayside Police Headquarters,
Dundee, had been charged with assaulting Miss Devlin in Old High Street, Perth,
on July 2 last year.
The sheriff also found the constable not guilty of assaulting Mr Richard Hind
in Gowans Terrace, Perth, on October 27 last year and of a breach of the peace
at Gowans Terrace on the same date.
Outside the court, Constable Howie, who said he had not been suspended by
Tayside Police, added: ``I am very pleased with the decision the court has
given today. It is a total vindication of my actions.
``I would like to thank my family, friends, and colleagues for the support they
have given me over the last 18 months.''
When his trial began last month, the constable faced nine charges - five of
assault and four of breach of the peace. At the earlier court, he was cleared
of three charges of breach of the peace and two of assault.
At the start of yesterday's proceedings, he was cleared of a further assault
charge after Sheriff Sutherland upheld a defence submission that there was no
case to answer.
Before he delivered his verdicts on the remaining charges yesterday, the
sheriff said it was always a serious matter when a police officer stood before
a court charged with assaulting a member of the public.
The sheriff said the law recognised that police faced a difficult task and were
entitled to use reasonable force.
He added that, in what he called an ``increasingly violent society'', it would
be ``intolerable'' if police officers risked prosecution every time they were
faced with people who resisted arrest.

heard yesterday. Lord MacLean jailed John Paton, 31, formerly of Elsinore Path,
East Kilbride, for seven years.
Dogged survivor
A JACK Russell terrier which was lost down a badger sett for six days
miraculously emerged alive yesterday. Three-year-old Esta found her own way out
and turned up caked in mud but unhurt, two miles from her home at Hambledon,
Hampshire.
Victim improves
FATHER-OF-TWO Paul Brighton, 44, left critically ill after his skull was
crushed in an incident involving teenagers at Waterville, near Peterborough, on
Saturday, is improving every hour, his wife said yesterday.
Store raid
A MAN threatened a shop assistant with a knife before stealing a three-figure
sum from the Global Video store in Milngavie Road, Bearsden, on Sunday evening.
Detectives are appealing for witnesses.
Whale study
RESEARCH funded by 14 major oil companies is to be carried out in the waters
west of Shetland to assess the impact of oil developments on the migratory
routes of whales.
Essayist jailed
A MAN who admitted fraud and having cannabis and ecstasy was praised by Sheriff
Nigel Thomson yesterday for an essay he asked him to write on crime and
punishment. However, the sheriff said he still had to jail Alan Dowell, of Weir
Court, Sighthill, Edinburgh, for nine months.
Tug's new trials
NEW sea trials are scheduled for tomorrow for a #5m tugboat built at the
Ferguson-Ailsa shipyard in Port Glasgow for Shetland Towage at Sullom Voe. It
is understood that equipment, supplied to measure the tug's power output,
failed on previous trials.
Charity theft
TOYS, clothes, and sweets which were bound for children made homeless by the

A COCAINE supplier who was jailed for seven years yesterday faces the
possibility of having his #34,000 home confiscated.
The Crown wants to get #97,000 which it claims is the proceeds of John Moffat's
drug deals. His lawyers were yesterday handed a statement of the Crown's motion
for confiscation detailing the assets they claim Moffat, 39, has built up from
drugs.
These include the house in Airbles Street, Motherwell, where lorry driver
Moffat lives with his wife and three children, aged 18, 14, and nine. Also
included are his savings and his D-registered Mercedes car.
Moffat yesterday admitted at the High Court in Glasgow being concerned in the
supply of cocaine between August and September in London, at Motherwell railway
station, and in his home.
Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, prosecuting, told how police, acting on information,
arrested Moffat at Motherwell railway station in September after he had got off
the London-Glasgow train. He had five packets of cocaine weighing half a kilo
strapped to his body. If traded in deals of one eighth of an ounce, they would
have been worth #24,000. Moffat also had #119 but a search of his house
revealed more cash totalling #6970 plus $1000.
Solicitor-advocate Maurice Smyth, defending, said Moffat was introduced by a
relative to a man who passed himself off as an American. He said he was
interested in starting off a business with grant aid for development and Moffat
helped him look at sites.
The American asked him to go to London and collect dollars for him which he
did. He was then asked to go south again and was given a package containing
cocaine.
Mr Smyth claimed that #550 of the money found by police was not from drugs but
was for the Pride of Motherwell Orange Flute Band of which Moffat was treasurer.

A NIGERIAN democracy campaigner, who is appealing against a Home Office
deportation order, yesterday claimed he would be executed if he was forced to
return home with his wife and two children.
Mr Akin Adegboye, who was released on bail last Friday after spending 142 days
in Edinburgh's Saughton Prison, told an asylum hearing in Glasgow that his work
as a ``covert information runner'' had led to him fleeing from Nigeria to
Britain. He admitted adopting devious means to try to remain here.
The hearing, before Mr Mungo Deans, a special adjudicator with the Immigration
Appellate authority, heard how members of Mr Adegboye's family, including his
wife and father, had been beaten by state security officers.
Mr Adegboye, 36, claimed his father, a businessman, died from his wounds three
weeks after the beating. He said his wife, Teju, also suffered beatings and
sexual harassment which included being forced to undress in public.
The hearing was told how Mr Adegboye, who has two daughters aged four and one,
had become interested in politics at Nigeria's Ijabuodu University between 1984
and 1988 where he attained a Bachelor of Education degree.
He began passing information between disenchanted military officers sympathetic
to the democracy movement and journalists.
Mr Adegboye left Nigeria in 1989 and came to Britain after a military contact,
Colonel Tony Nyiam, told him he was on a list ordering his arrest dead or alive.
Following a coup attempt in 1990, Mr Adegboye said he did not apply for
political asylum because Nigerian leaders had announced a programme for
democratic elections.
``I was still hoping to go back home,'' he said. However, he later carried out
a series of deceptions which led to his detention on Home Office orders on July
27 after finishing a sentence for claiming income support using a false
passport. He had pled guilty but insisted he needed a false identity because
Nigerian government officials were trying to find him and his family.
Their pursuit led him to flee from London to Edinburgh. He and his family now
live in Wester Hailes where many community members have vowed to mount a
massive campaign if the deportation goes against the family.
Mr Adegboye yesterday also admitted entering into a bigamous marriage of
convenience, which he said he had no intention of fulfilling, to try to protect
his right to stay in Britain where he had been joined by his wife.
Mr Paul Seils, the Scottish Refugee Council solicitor representing Mr Adegboye,
yesterday produced documentary evidence that Nigerian High Commission staff had
made contact with his client in this country.
Asked by Mr Seils what would happen if he returned to Nigeria, Mr Adegboye
said: ``I would get killed. I have no doubt.''
When asked who would order his death, he said: ``The president of the military
government, General Abacha.''
Mr Adegboye claimed political asylum last year after being advised by Colonel
Nyiam. The colonel, who now has residence in Scotland after marrying a Scot, is
expected to give evidence to the hearing today. Mr Deans ruled that Mr
Adegboye's bail should be continued until January 11 when a determination on
the case would be announced.

FAMILY, friends, and fellow pupils yesterday bid farewell to murdered
schoolgirl Naomi Smith during a funeral service in the Methodist chapel less
than half a mile from her home and the playground where her body was found.
Villagers watched in silence as the cortege passed through Ansley Common,
Warwickshire, before the coffin was carried into the church to the strains of
Eric Clapton's Tears In Heaven. Tell Me There's a Heaven by Chris Rea was also
played as the Rev Jennifer Hurd reminded the congregation of Naomi's love of
music, before summing up the feelings of loss for the 15-year-old Hartshill
School pupil.
``God did not intend Naomi to die on the brink of womanhood. She was a
big-hearted, generous, helping, and caring girl who had the whole of her life
in front of her.''
She spoke of the ``terrible September night'' when Naomi was cruelly and
savagely taken away, and said: ``The emotions we are feeling today are grief,
anger, despair, confusion, regret, and hatred. Don't try to suppress them - use
them positively to rebuild the community.''
Parents Brian and Catherine Smith supported each other as they walked into the
church for the service, her brothers Andrew and David Freeman carried the
coffin.
It was Mr Smith, 45, and Naomi's best friend Emma Jones, 15, who found the
teenager's mutilated body less than 100 yards from her home on the Bretts Hall
Estate in September, after she left home to post a letter.
Emma was not at the funeral but other pupils and teachers were among the 100
mourners in the small chapel.
After the service, Naomi was taken to the Heart of England Crematorium,
Nuneaton, for a private family ceremony.
A 19-year-old man has been charged with the murder.

A DEBT-laden father who faced a #2800 bill from the Child Support Agency took
his own life and unlawfully killed his four children, a coroner ruled yesterday.
Divorcee Phillip Mitchell, 36, killed himself and children Jonathan, nine,
Cathryn, seven, and twins Jessica and Christopher, six, in a fume-filled car,
an inquest in Crewe, Cheshire, was told.
Police said later that Mr Mitchell had debts of more than #20,000 and had just
received a demand to pay the Child Support Agency #2800 within 14 days.
Mr John Hibbert, Cheshire coroner, was told how Mr Mitchell, who had open
access to the children, collected them from Church Walk Primary School in
Northwich, Cheshire, on Thursday, September 28, and took them to a restaurant
at Hale, Manchester.
Their mother Linda, 34, received a telephone call from them at their home in
Rudheath. Mr Mitchell agreed to look after the children until 8pm while she
went to netball practice, Detective Chief Inspector Jim Buckley told the
inquest.
Mr Buckley said Mrs Mitchell had spoken to the children and could hear them
laughing on the telephone.
However, Mr Mitchell did not return them and Mrs Mitchell made a series of
telephone calls and visits to his flat in Arbour Close, Rudheath, to try to
find the children.
Mr Buckley said a factory worker found Mr Mitchell's Ford Fiesta in Middlewich
at 7.45 the next morning with its engine running and a hosepipe connected to
the exhaust and leading into the car.
``He saw a man with his head slumped backwards in the driver's seat,'' said Mr
Buckley. ``When he opened the door he found inside the dead bodies of Phillip
and his four children.''
Mr Buckley added: ``There was no evidence whatsoever to show that any person
other than Phillip Mitchell was involved in his death or those of his four
children.''
He said the engine had been running for about eight hours and the children had
sweets with them.
He said he discovered financial problems and said there was evidence that Mr
Mitchell had contemplated killing himself on his wedding anniversary on
September 19.
He had bought a hosepipe that day and confided his thoughts to a counsellor the
next day.
Dr Alan Williams, Home Office pathologist, said that all five had died of
carbon monoxide poisoning and there were no significant injuries to any of the
children.
Recording his verdicts, Mr Hibbert said: ``Phillip Mitchell, with his financial
problems, has taken this way out, but we have to ask ourselves why on earth did
he take the four children at the same time? There is the enigma - we shall
never be really sure why he did it.''
No reference to the Child Support Agency was made during the hearing but the
organisation was represented by Mr Peter Headland, who declined to comment on
its behalf afterwards.
Mr Buckley confirmed that Mr Mitchell had received a demand to pay #2800 within
14 days from the agency a few days before he died.
He was also to start paying #51.50p a week child support via the DSS from the
following week and had debts of more than #20,000.
He had been doing a contract cleaning job in the evenings, in addition to his
day job as a cutter at the Ilford photographic works in Mobberley, but had just
lost the contract because he had not been turning up regularly enough.
Mr Buckley said: ``He had set out to try to get rich very quickly but he had
taken bad advice and his attempt to get rich led to him going further into
debt.''
He had tried pyramid selling, gambling at casinos, and paying off loans by
taking out other loans.
He said: ``I think the CSA demand was one of several he received that week. I
cannot be specific in saying that was the one demand that pushed him over the
edge.''
Asked why he thought Mr Mitchell had killed the children, Mr Buckley said: ``I
honestly think he loved his children so much that if he was going, he was going
to take the children with him. It's as simple as that.''
He said Mrs Mitchell was ``not very well'' at the moment, adding: ``Today's
events will not have helped her.''

IN their haste to legislate on the transport of live animals to the Continent,
the Government and the European Commission are in danger of undermining the
economics of crofting in the Highlands and Islands, it was claimed yesterday.
Highland Regional Council and the Highland Council elect are joining the
Scottish Crofters Union in raising the matter with the Scottish Office on
behalf of crofters, whose movement of live animals to mainland markets and
winter pasture is essential.
The EU directive will insist that, after eight hours of transport, animals must
have 24 hours rest with feed and water at a staging post - which must be
neither the place of departure (croft), or place of destination (mart or
wintering farm).
The councils and the SCU believe the directive is incapable of being
implemented reasonably and rationally within an area like the Highlands and
Islands, where transport by road and ferry can often take longer than eight
hours from mainland areas like West Ardnamurchan, or communities like those in
north Skye.
Proposals to be put by the SCU include exempting journeys of less than 150km
from the new regulations, taking account of the poorer road infrastrucutre; all
journeys within island groups being exempt; and wintering of animals being
classed as non-commercial activity, and thus exempt from the regulations.

Madrid
SPAIN'S Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, will lead his Socialist Party into the
General Election in March.
After a five-hour meeting of the party executive today, the 52-year-old leader
was persuaded to head the campaign for a fifth election victory.
However all recent opinion polls show the conservative Popular Party set to
oust the Socialists from office after 13 years in power. A poll conducted on
behalf of the government showed the Socialists trailing the conservatives by
between six and eight points.
The Prime Minister, at the forefront of Spain's new democracy, and his party
have seen their popularity plummet after a series of scandals involving alleged
fraud and corruption both within the government and the establishment.
The former Interior Minister, Jose Barrionuevo, will again be questioned this
week by a Supreme Court judge following allegations that he was directly
involved in setting up and running so-called death squads in the 1980s which
murdered 27 suspected Basque separatists.
q Carlos Westendorp, the Secretary of State for EU Affairs, was tonight named
as the new Spanish Foreign Minister. He replaces Javier Solana who tomorrow
takes up his appointment as the new secretary-general of Nato.

A BITTER new battle broke out between Europe and the Ministry of Defence
yesterday after the case of Falklands veteran Alex Findlay was referred to the
European Court of Human Rights.
At stake is the future of the entire court martial system, and the British
military establishment has vowed to defend to the last its ancient right to
discipline its own.
Former Scots guardsman Mr Findlay, 34, from Kilmarnock and now living in
Windsor, alleges that his court martial lacked independence and impartiality,
that the proceedings were unfair, that their decisions were unreasonable, and
that the available sentencing options were limited.
The European Commission of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled unanimously that
the case should be considered by the court.
The decision is the first critical step in a campaign by former servicemen and
women to have the court martial system scrapped. It could open the floodgates
for dozens of similar cases and cost the MoD millions of pounds in compensation.
Mr Findlay's solicitor, Mr John Mackenzie, said the decision was ``bad news''
for the Government. He said: ``The decision was absolutely right. The
Government ought to take it on board and the logical thing to do would be to
abolish the courts martial system.
``I am confident that the European Court will find in our favour.''
However, defence chiefs immediately signalled their decision to fight. ``We
believe the court martial system has served the forces and the country very
well indeed,'' said an MoD spokeswoman.
The case, which will be heard in the middle of next year, concerns the two-year
prison sentence passed on Mr Findlay in November 1991 for threatening to kill
fellow soldiers.
Yet the former Scots guardsman had suffered a nervous breakdown which could be
traced back to his experiences in the Falklands conflict. He was deeply
affected by the sight of his comrades being killed and seriously injured and he
saved another soldier's life by opening up his windpipe with a bayonet allowing
him to breathe.
It was during a second tour of duty in Northern Ireland in 1990 that the crisis
erupted. A fellow soldier opened a can of beer and the noise reminded him of a
bullet whizzing past his head. He pulled out a pistol and put it to the head of
another guardsman before taking two other soldiers hostage and firing two
shots. However, he was successfully disarmed without anyone being injured.
He was examined by two Army psychiatrists, who confirmed he was suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder, but despite pleas for moderate treatment, the
Army court sent him to jail.
Mr Findlay has already succeeded in one battle with defence chiefs - he was
awarded #100,000 after claiming the Army failed to diagnose he was suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder.
Euro-sceptics will have a field day with this latest decision. Although the
Strasbourg-based court is quite separate from the European Union and its Court
of Justice in Luxembourg, many critics of European decision-making tend to
ignore the difference and to blame events which don't suit the United Kingdom
on ``Europe'' generally.

SOMETHING must be going right with the United States: the murder rate dropped
12% in the first half of this year, almost as much as it dropped in the whole
of 1994.
Some of the detailed declines are even more dramatic: the murder rate in New
York went down 31% in the first half of the year, compared with the same period
last year. That meant that 574 people were killed, compared with 835 in the
first six months in 1994. In Washington, the numbers are 151 this year compared
with 193 in 1994, a drop of 21%.
The latest figures are part of a longer-term trend. In Washington, for
instance, there were 489 murders in 1991, so this year, which will presumably
have about 300 murders, is a huge improvement.
The FBI, which issued the figures over the weekend, notes that the declines do
not necessarily represent an increase in general goodwill. Part of the drop is
demographic: there are now fewer men aged 17 to 27, the prime age of violent
criminals.
However, the number of teenage boys is rising again, so that will soon be
reflected in the statistics.
Another reason offered for the good news is bad news: the very high murder
rates in the 1980s and early 90s were in large part because of gang warfare
between competing street gangs selling drugs. The FBI observes that in the big
cities, where the steepest declines in violence have occurred, the gangs seem
to have resolved their turf battles.
They have now settled which gangs will control the best street corners and drug
markets, so there is less need to enforce their territorial imperatives with
heavy weapons.
The bureau does take some credit, together with local police forces, for
aggressively pursuing drug gangs and illegal guns. If they keep guns out of the
hands of violent young men, fewer of them will get killed. There is also the
rather depressing fact that an increasing number of young men, particularly
young blacks, are now in prison.
Other crimes, such as burglary, have not declined, and the rate of violent
crime has actually increased in California and in small towns and rural areas.

INDIAN authorities are not optimistic that Kashmir separatists who have been
holding two Britons and two other Western tourists hostage since July will
resume talks they broke off three weeks ago.
``It is up to Al-Faran to contact us, but we are not much hopeful that they
will re-establish contact with government representatives,'' said a Jammu and
Kashmir spokesman.
``Since there are no adverse reports about the safety and health of the
hostages, we assume that all the four hostages are safe and well,'' he said.
An Indian negotiator said efforts were under way to re-establish contact with
the kidnappers of to the shadowy Al-Faran group and to locate the hostages.
``There is no news about the hostages for the last 21 days. They were reported
sighted on December 7 in Akingam village in south Kashmir,'' he said.
Jandial said the government had not heard from Al-Faran since November 26,
barely a fortnight after resuming talks following a 52-day gap.
Britons Keith Mangan, 33, from Middlesbrough, and Paul Wells, 23, from
Blackburn, American Donald Hutchings, and German Dirk Hasert were kidnapped in
early July.
A fifth hostage, Hans Christian Ostroe, was found beheaded on August 13.-Reuter.

AFTER four hours of deliberation, members of the jury hearing the David Ashby
libel action had not reached a verdict and were sent home by the judge to
resume their deliberations today.
The jury had been told that the court accept a verdict on which at least 10 of
its members were agreed after three-and-a-half hours of deliberation.
It had witnessed a family exposing its misery in the full glare of publicity,
High Court judge Mr Justice Morland said.
He began his summing up by telling the jurors that they must, at times, have
thought they were trying an old-style cruelty petition in a divorce court.
``You have been witnessing a family exposing its misery in the full glare of
publicity.
``You've heard the details of verbal abuse, physical abuse between husband and
wife - both claim to still love each other very much, although they have given
evidence on opposite sides.''
The 55-year-old MP for North West Leicestershire is claiming damages over a
Sunday Times story, of January 1994, supplied, he claims, by his sister Lynne
Garling, which said that he shared a double bed with a male friend during a
holiday in Goa.
Times Newspapers Ltd and former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil deny libel.
They assert that he was, and is, having an affair with 32-year-old Dr Kilduff.

DETECTIVES last night were piecing together the final hours of a schoolgirl
who
set off for home after enjoying a Christmas pantomime and was found murdered
a
few hundred yards from her destination.
As a full-scale murder inquiry involving more than 100 officers from
throughout
Strathclyde swung into action in Kilmarnock, the local community was united
in
stunned grief for 16-year-old Mhairi Julyan, who met her death while walking
home from the Palace Theatre on Saturday evening.
The feelings of the community were summed up by a Church of Scotland minister,
the Rev.David Lacy, who described the killing as ``the surfacing of evil in
its
worst form''.
The Kilmarnock Academy pupil had been attending the panto Sleeping Beauty,
starring comedian Johnny Beattie, with her mother Maureen and was to be
collected by her father, Mr Philip Julyan.
She phoned to say that she would make her own way home, however, and set off
to
walk to the family house in Samson Avenue.
Police officers, alerted by her parents, began a search of the area and on
Sunday afternoon found the body of a young girl in deep undergrowth behind the
Stagecoach Western Scottish bus depot in McKinlay Crescent.
The body was identified formally by Mr Julyan and as a post-mortem examination
was carried out at Crosshouse Hospital the detective leading the investigation
announced that the death was being treated as murder.
Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder appealed for anyone who was in the area,
which takes in the Palace Theatre and the bus depot, between 9pm on Saturday
and 3pm on Sunday to contact the police at once.
He added: ``I would also urge anyone who may have seen a young girl walking in
that area or who saw anything suspicious to come forward.''
Pantomime star Johnny Beattie said yesterday that he and his colleagues in the
production were in a state of shock. ``There is a lot of distress among the
company. You feel a kind of connection, the fact that the last thing Mhairi
saw
was our pantomime.''
He added: ``You begin to wonder what kind of world we are living in when a
young lassie cannot go out, enjoy herself and get home safely.''
Police reinforcements were called in yesterday to seal off the bus garage and
begin an inch by inch examination of the area near where the body was found.
They were joined by forensic experts who combed the area and took away various
items for analysis.
Detectives appear to have established no motive for the murder at this stage
and were reluctant to discuss the cause of death or in what condition the body
was found.
It appeared during yesterday's fingertip search, however, that a weapon was
being sought as a matter of urgency.
Police would not discuss reports that Miss Julyan may have been accompanied on
her journey home but other people who attended Saturday's evening performance
of the popular pantomime will be interviewed as part of the continuing
investigation.
The Stagecoach depot remained closed yesterday and crews were interviewed by
detectives.
Miss Julyan was known as a popular pupil who was studying for Higher grade
examinations at Kilmarnock Academy. Yesterday, the atmosphere at the school
was
one of shock and disbelief at the killing.
Headmaster Frank Donnelly said: ``Pupils and staff who knew Mhairi are
absolutely devastated. We have specially trained counsellors standing by to
help the pupils cope with their grief.''
A school Christmas disco that was to be held last night, and which Miss Julyan
was planning to attend, was cancelled as a mark of respect.
A police officer was in attendance at the family home last night and during
the
day the family doctor was called in to give assistance to the dead girl's
mother and her elder sister Claire, 21, who were being comforted by relatives.
Police made a fresh appeal for information late last night but said it was
unlikely further details of the progress of their inquiries would be available
until later today.
q.Detectives in Edinburgh are treating as suspicious the death of a
40-year-old
unemployed chef found at the weekend lying in a street close to the city's
Royal Mile.
Mr George Bisset, from Whitehorse Close in the Old Town, was discovered around
1am on Saturday in Jeffrey Street. He had head injuries. He was taken to the
nearby Royal Infirmary, where he later died.
It is known that Mr Bisset had been drinking in the Royal Archer public house
in Jeffrey Street near to where he was found. Police also know he had been
drinking in several public houses in the High Street on Friday evening.
A Lothian and Borders police spokesman said yesterday they wanted to hear from
anyone who was in the dead man's company on Friday night and early Saturday
morning.
He said they had traced a man who it is believed went to Mr Bisset's help and
he had been eliminated from the investigation.
Mr Bisset is described as being 5ft 10in tall, well built with short, greying
hair. He was wearing black denim jeans, a blue denim shirt over a grey
T-shirt,
and black boots.

Jerusalem
A VIDEOTAPE of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination, showing the killer stalking the
Israeli Prime Minister before shooting him in the back, was sold today for
around #260,000.
Israel's commercial television station, Channel Two, said it and the
biggest-selling newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth had bought the rights to the amateur
photographer's footage, the only known recording of the November 4
assassination.
Shalom Kital, director of Channel Two, told Israel Radio: ``We are speaking of
a sad event, perhaps the most dramatic event in the history of the state of
Israel. We are speaking of a matter of very great public and media worth.''
The tape - the last eight minutes of which show the killing - will be broadcast
before the end of the week, he said.
Lawyers for the photographer, identified as 37-year-old Polish immigrant
Gershon Shalvinsky, put his videotape up for sale yesterday after it was used
as evidence in the official inquiry into Rabin's murder.
Industry sources said they expected the new owners of the film to recoup more
than the cost by selling rights to TV stations around the world.
Rabin was shot after a Tel Aviv peace rally by a Jewish gunman who goes on
trial tomorrow. The tape is said to show confessed killer Yigal Amir standing
next to a large plant then walking straight up to Rabin to shoot him in the
back.
Rabin's widow Leah said yesterday that she does not want to see the pictures.
Today her daughter Dahlia said: ``Viewing it won't be easy.''
Meanwhile, the inquiry into the killing dealt a blow to the reputation of
Israel's secret service Shin Bet today, warning agents that they could be
harmed by its findings.
The Justice Ministry sent warning letters to six top agents in Shin Bet,
including its head, and to an assisant police commander.
In what analysts said was a ``night of the long knives'' for the service, the
agents were told to take legal advice before the committee resumes its hearings
on December 31.-Reuter.

AN official announcement is expected later today confirming that oil
fabrication company BARMAC is to spend #8m upgrading the graving dock at the
ailing oil fabrication yard at Nigg in Easter Ross.
This will enable Nigg to compete for contracts to fit out and, perhaps in the
longer term, build floating production systems, which are being used
increasingly as a fast and cheaper method of bringing oil fields on stream.
Yesterday, BARMAC general manager Don Wright, gave a private presentation to
councillors at Ross and Cromarty District Council. He refused to comment after
the meeting, although he emerged smiling and said: ``You will have to wait for
an announcement, which will be made on Tuesday.''
However, it is understood the two parent companies involved in the merged
BARMAC venture have committed between #5m and #6m of their own money to the
project.
The project will also be the subject of an application for European grant aid.
The granting of Objective One funding will be subject to the number of jobs it
will create but the grant could be up to 30%.
The yard employs around 370 hourly paid workers.

<HEADLINE>Consumer groups called in as new research adds weight to official view Bid to cool the mad cow fears</HEADLINE>

GOVERNMENT officials met consumer group representatives yesterday in a bid to
reduce the heat generated by the mad cow disease debate.
At the same time, results of new research emerged which look set to alleviate
fears over the safety of British beef.
The findings, based on tests on laboratory mice, appear to show that the agent
which triggers bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle is extremely
unlikely to jump the ``species barrier'' into humans.
Meanwhile, beef sales in shops have dropped 15% because of the BSE scare - with
some butchers saying business has ``gone through the floor'', official figures
revealed.
The Meat and Livestock Commission said the figures were ``worrying'' but
officials were hopeful the worst might be over.
The Government's chief medical officer, Dr Kenneth Calman, welcomed the results
of the new research last night. However, he pointed out that they were interim
findings and more research was needed.
Representatives from about 20 consumer and catering organisations were invited
to yesterday's meeting, the first of its kind, hosted by the Ministry of
Agriculture.
Two members of the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee (SEAC) as well
as the Government's Chief Veterinary Officer Keith Meldrum and his assistant
Kevin Taylor spoke about the control of BSE and its implications for public
health.
However, there was no discussion of the latest findings by leading BSE expert
Professor John Collinge to be published in the science journal Nature on
Thursday.
Ms Jeannette Longfield, co-ordinator of the National Food Alliance, said: ``We
thought we might be told something startling and new but basically they just
wanted to talk to us because they felt under siege with all the current
publicity about BSE.''
She said that, while no promises were made, the officials appeared to take on
board two of the consumer organisations' chief demands - to have a consumer
representative on SEAC and to label products containing mechanically recovered
meat.
Ms Diane McCrea, head of food and health at the Consumer's Association, said:
``They were trying very hard to be helpful and allowed us to ask a lot of
questions but, at the end of the day, the public are no further forward.''
A Ministry of Agriculture spokesman said the new findings were not brought up
at the meeting because they were not yet published and no-one asked about them.
The fears about BSE centre on the possibility of the agent that causes it
triggering off a similar brain disease in humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
The Government has always insisted there was no evidence that BSE was a threat
to humans, while taking the precaution of banning certain types of offal - such
as the brain and spinal cord - which are most likely to contain the BSE agent.
For his tests, Prof Collinge, of the department of biochemistry and molecular
genetics, Imperial College School of Medicine at St Mary's Hospital, London,
used laboratory mice which had been genetically altered to mimic human reaction
to the BSE agent.
Both BSE and CJD are caused by a kind of chain reaction triggered when the
infective agent, an abnormal form of protein, modifies a naturally-occurring
and normally harmless protein in the host called a ``prion''.
The big question has always been whether the BSE agent can affect prions in the
human brain.
In the tests, scientists injected the agent directly into the brains of mice
bred to express the human prion.
The mice remained healthy and did not develop CJD. However, another group of
mice injected with a different agent known to cause CJD duly developed the
disease.
Dr Calman said in a statement last night: ``I welcome the publication of
Professor Collinge's recent findings in the forthcoming edition of Nature and
the important contribution these will add to our understanding of any potential
human susceptibility to BSE.''

A MAN killed his neighbour with a crowbar in an argument over a barking poodle,
a jury heard yesterday.
Roofer Nicholas Farnell, 32, lost his temper in a row with 56-year-old Mr Willy
Pottage and his wife, Christine, after they went out, leaving their puppy
barking in their garden, Winchester Crown Court was told.
Mr Michael Sayers, QC, prosecuting, said that on May 6 last year the Pottages,
of Waterlooville, Hampshire, went shopping, leaving the puppy, Max, in their
garden.
When they returned, Mr Farnell complained about the dog's barking. Although Mr
Pottage apologised, Mr Farnell continued to complain and threatened to report
the couple to the RSPCA. Mr Pottage swore at Mr Farnell, and told him to go
away.
Mr Farnell, who denies murder but admits manslaughter, went to his car and
returned with a crowbar, saying: ``You want some, do you?''
He hit Mr Pottage on the head. As Mr Pottage fell, he banged his head on the
road. When his shocked wife said: ``Look what you have done,'' Mr Farnell
replied: ``Do you want some too?''
Mr Pottage died in hospital four days later. His right jaw and the back of his
skull had been fractured.
Mr Sayers said the defence would argue that Mr Farnell had not intended really
serious harm, and would put forward a case for diminished responsibility.
The hearing continues.

A 15-YEAR-OLD girl told a jury yesterday she was raped in the back of a police
car by a constable who found her collapsed in the street after sniffing
solvents.
She said the attack happened in a car park at a police station after Constable
Adam Grice-Roberts, 32, had been told to drive her to hospital. The girl gave
her evidence by a video link from a room inside Preston Crown Court where Mr
Grice-Roberts, of Hutton, near Preston, denies rape. He admits having unlawful
sexual intercourse with her.
The court had heard that the girl, who lived at a children's home in North
Wales, had been visiting her family when she collapsed in an alley after
sniffing butane gas.
She claimed Mr Grice-Roberts had first indecently assaulted her and then raped
her after taking her to Blackpool Central police station. The girl, who denied
telling the officer she was 17, admitted not complaining until nearly 12 hours
later .
She also admitted she had not told him to stop during the time they had
intercourse, because she was sniffing two cans of gas.
Mr Guy Gozem, prosecuting, said: ``The prosecution case is that the girl did
not consent. She was insensible throughout from sniffing gas. She was in no
condition to decide whether to consent or not.

Bogota
US-COLOMBIAN ties worsened today after a US State Department official
criticised a Colombian congressional panel's decision to clear President
Ernesto Samper of drug corruption charges.
The committee said last week that it was shelving an investigation that could
have led to Samper's impeachment, saying there was no hard evidence to support
charges that he used Cali cartel drug money to win elections last year.
The decision promoted a triumphant Samper to declare an end to the political
crisis that has dogged his government.
However Robert Gelbard, US assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics and crime, threw Washington's weight behind Colombian opposition
leaders who have called the Colombian ruling a whitewash.
``It's evident that this wasn't a serious investigation,'' Gelbard said. ``This
committee's effort unfortunately shows that there are still certain people
linked to drug traffickers in power.''
Foreign Minister Rodrigo Pardo and other government officials angrily accused
Gelbard of meddling in Colombia's internal affairs.
However the US Ambassador to Colombia, Myles Frechette, has warned that
Washington may decertify Colombia as a partner in the fight against drugs next
year, withdrawing key aid and trade preferences.-Reuter.

Grozny
RUSSIAN forces are preparing an all-out attack on Chechnya's second city,
Gudermes, where hundreds of Chechen guerrillas were pinning down more than 150
Russian soldiers.
Military sources said the Russian commanders had decided to break the siege of
the town's military headquarters and rail station, and had told civilians to
leave or to take shelter.
Other Russian sources said they were preparing to launch airstrikes and heavy
artillery against Gudermes, where separatists have been battling troops since
Thursday.
Fighting flared as voting began in local and national elections staged by the
Moscow-backed administration in the face of bitter opposition from separatists
led by Dzhokhar Dudayev.
One military source said 176 soldiers were being pinned in their command post
at Gudermes by a rebel force estimated at 500 to 650. The railway station, an
important junction for the whole Caucasus region, was also under siege.
The town of 60,000, 20 miles east of Grozny, is sealed off by troops. Russian
reporters given limited access last night to army positions on the outskirts
saw thick smoke from burning buildings. Many homes had been destroyed.-Reuter.

Paris
RAIL workers resisting a growing return to work after a 24-day strike blocked
Eurostar trains leaving Paris for London today and high-speed trains serving
northern France.
A spokeswoman for the SNCF state railways said workers began blocking all
trains due to leave Paris's Gare du Nord station just before 11am, though most
other employees were returning after a strike of more than three weeks over
retirement benefits and reforms.
Trains across the country trickled back into service today and in Paris all 13
Metro underground lines were at least partially operational.
However relief that the giant traffic jams were over was marred by signs that
the three-week dispute played havoc with the economy. The national statistics
office estimated the cost at 0.3-04% of quarterly national income, and a small
business federation said the strike would send an extra 5000 companies to the
wall.
The conservative government and trade unions braced for another battle at a
``labour summit'' on Thursday and union bosses warned that fresh unrest could
resurface in the New Year.
``Workers may have given up a little ground but they have not abandoned their
demands. That means that they are not satisfied,'' said Marc Blondel, general
secretary of the independent Force Ouvriere union.-Reuter.

Johannesburg
A BRITISH arms dealer arrested in South Africa must wait until Thursday to
learn if he will spend Christmas in jail.
Paul Grecian's conviction for selling parts for a ``supergun'' to Iraq was
overturned by the Court of Appeal in London last month, after security service
papers showed the Government had turned a blind eye to the deals in return for
intelligence about Saddam Hussein's military build-up.
However Mr Grecian, 40, was arrested last Friday on arrival at Johannesburg
International Airport on an Interpol warrant for his extradition to the United
States.
Mr Grecian appeared at Kempton Park Magistrates Court, Johannesburg, this
afternoon to apply for bail, having given up his passport to the South African
authorities.
The case was adjourned until Thursday, to give the authorities time to prepare
a case for him to be held in custody.
He is being held in Pretoria Moot jail.
Prosecutor Phillip Koekemoer told the court that evidence to support Mr
Grecian's continued detention had to be obtained from the US and he asked for
more time.
The court was told that Mr Grecian was a fugitive from justice with the means
to flee a trial if released on bail.
However Mr Grecian's barrister, Lawrence Hodes, argued that a US warrant had no
validity in South Africa, adding: ``It's clearly a political offence. He is
unlawfully detained and he is entitled to bail.''
If extradited, Mr Grecian is expected to face trial in the US on identical
charges to those on which he was initially convicted in the UK, as well as a
further charge of bank fraud.
He went to South Africa for a holiday with his fiancee Elizabeth Powell and was
arrested by Interpol, who said a ``red notice'' on him had been issued in 176
countries.
An extradition treaty between South Africa and the US places a limit of two
months on extradition proceedings, but this may be extended ``if the court
allows''.
Mr Grecian is a former managing director of British-based Ordtec, which
exported artillery fuses to Iraq for use in its supergun before the Gulf War.
Iraq was planning a long-range cannon that was to be the biggest gun ever made,
with a barrel of 518ft and a calibre of 3.3ft. Its parts were later destroyed
by the United Nations.

CHOCOLATE giant Nestle was criticised last night for snatching the last Rolo.
There used to be 11 of the caramel-filled chocolates - famous for their ``Do
you love someone enough to give them your last Rolo?'' commercials - in a tube.
Nestle has reduced the number to 10 without cutting the price. The move was
highlighted by the BBC1 consumer programme Watchdog after a complaint from a
viewer.
Nestle defended its action, saying it had cut the packet size instead of
raising the recommended retail price of 24p.
Mother-of-two Mrs Sue Brewer, of Oundle, Northampton, complained that Nestle
had ruined her chocolate treat.
She told Watchdog she normally gave each of her two sons five Rolos and spoiled
herself by eating the last one. The last time she bought a pack, the last Rolo
had gone.
``I'm feeling cheated because I didn't find anyone who loved me enough to give
me some chocolate at a fair price, or to be honest enough to print `one less
same price' on the packet,'' she said.
A Nestle spokeswoman said other firms had raised prices of similar brands and
argued that Rolos were still good value for money.
``The action we have taken has enabled us to maintain the price at a
competitive level and we believe Rolo offer excellent value for money,'' she
added. She said the change had actually taken place last year.

A STRONG recovery by the Scottish tourist industry in the UK market was
announced in Edinburgh yesterday.
The Scottish Tourist Board said holiday tourism spending in Scotland by UK
residents for the first eight months of this year was, in real terms, 9% ahead
of the corresponding period last year.
Figures published by the United Kingdom Tourism Survey showed that Scotland had
hosted 4.1 million holiday trips, with spending of #701m, by the end of August.
This compared with #646m in the corresponding period of the previous year,
which had seen a decline of 17%. British tourists, including Scots, increased
holiday trips to Scotland by more than 5% over the last year. There was a fall
of 7% in this area in 1993-94.
There was a 27% increase in spending, in real terms, on eight and more nights
holidays in Scotland from within the UK, from #202m to #257m.
Mr Ian Grant, STB chairman, said 1995 had been a good recovery year for tourism
in Scotland. ``The task now,'' he said, ``must be to build on this success and
sustain the turnaround.''

A MAJOR Edinburgh hospital has been severely criticised by the Scottish Health
Advisory Service watchdog body, it was claimed last night.
The service, according to a ``confidential'' report obtained by BBC Scotland,
made an inspection of the Royal Edinburgh Psychiatric Hospital and passed on
its observations to the hospital trust last October.
It is alleged that the inquiry found violent incidents involving staff,
patients, and the public, not enough nursing staff to cope with demands, and
patients feeling insecure.
The report emerged only 24 hours after hospital consultants throughout Britain
criticised failings in the NHS through lack of funding.
It is said to have recommended a reduction of up to 40% in acute psychiatric
care beds at the hospital, allowing better care to develop. Standards of
cleanliness at the hospital were said to be ``abysmal''.
A spokeswoman for the hospital said last night that it had not yet received a
written draft from the service but had a presentation two weeks ago at which a
number of points were raised and these were being investigated.
Ms June Andrews, Scottish secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ``We
have been concerned for some time about a number of issues relating to mental
health care. It is proving difficult to recruit mental health nursing staff and
research has demonstrated that the quality of service depends on the right
care.''

ROSTISLAV KHOTIN
Moscow
COMMUNIST chief Gennady Zyuganov, the biggest winner in Russia's General
Election, said his party's success showed his countrymen had changed and
President Boris Yeltsin would be facing a completely different assembly.
Zyuganov said he was satisfied with the outcome, which gave his party more than
one-fifth of the vote, and pledged to form a Shadow Cabinet in the State Duma
to draw up a ``realistic'' economic programme after consulting its allies.
He renewed calls to stage a referendum on reinstating the Soviet Union. However
he admitted that his ability to act was limited by a constitution placing vast
powers in Yeltsin's hands and said his party's real prize would be next June's
presidential election.
``The new Duma will be different from the old one. Yeltsin and (Prime Minister
Viktor) Chernomyrdin had no right to carry out the old policies,'' Zyuganov
told a news conference.
``In fact, the government has received a vote of no confidence. This is a
complete rejection of the old radical system. The system has collapsed and
become bankrupt.''
Zyuganov said the communists, who claim half a million members, viewed the
campaign in two phases culminating in the presidential vote on June 16.
``We're in the process of resolving the first and now we're looking at the
second,'' said. ``We can't just think about today, as some parties do. We have
deeper, more serious strategies.''
Zyuganov said his party would meet next month to decide whether to put him
forward as a candidate for the presidency, which in the long term the
communists want to abolish.
Among his policy priorities, he told the news conference, was securing the
dismissal of Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, accused by Communists of selling
out Russian interests in the name of friendship with the West.
Sources close to Kozyrev said he would probably quit after his election to a
seat in northern Russia is confirmed.
In another interview, Zyuganov repeated his party's warnings against Nato
taking in any new members from among the former Warsaw Pact.
``Then Russia would be forced to form a new bloc, regardless of who is in
power,'' he told Stern magazine. ``And the West would lose a market with
enormous raw materials reserves.''
Zyuganov won the support of Russians by promising to ease reforms introduced by
President Boris Yeltsin's government after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet
Union.
During a campaign relying heavily on grass-roots contacts rather than
sophisticated television advertising, he called for restoration of Soviet-era
health and medical care, retention of some prices controls, and incentives for
investment.
Zyuganov, at great pains during the campaign to reassure Western investors,
told reporters attracting outside investment should be a priority in Russia, as
it was in China.
``Russia is in 139th place in the world as far as investment is concerned,
China is in sixth place,'' he said.-Reuter.

<TEXT>
AN armed robber, described as Scotland's most wanted man, was yesterday jailed
for 12 years for a spree of violent raids while on the run.
Brian Martin, nicknamed the Hawk, admitted raids at building societies
throughout England and Wales. Cardiff Crown Court heard how 6ft 3in Martin was
arrested when he stepped off a ferry in Portsmouth after returning from a
Spanish holiday.
Martin, 37, was being hunted by police for seven major crimes in Scotland,
including threatening two officers with a sawn-off shotgun and the robbery of a
building society in Oban. He fled to England where he stayed for nine months
with his common-law wife, Julie Bryce.
During two of the robberies, Martin was helped by his 18-year-old nephew, Alan
Clements, who yesterday was given six years in youth custody.
Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said Martin first struck at the Leeds Permanent
building society in Portsmouth where he took #2710.
``Martin approached the cashier with a kitchen knife and told her: `Give me all
the money. Put it in this bag.' The cashier was left shocked and numbed by her
ordeal.''
Martin then raided the National Provincial in Horsham, Sussex, but was forced
to flee when security shutters closed.
He later robbed the Alliance and Leicester in Chatham, Kent, of #2800 and the
Scarborough in Beverley, Humberside, of more than #1000.
On his last two robberies, the Bristol and West in Glastonbury, Somerset, and
the Alliance and Leicester in Cardiff, he brought in Clements.
The court heard these raids netted the pair, who were armed with a starting
pistol, #3800. Martin then fled to Benidorm with his common-law wife and
Clements.
A television appeal on BBC's Crimewatch UK led to Martin being identified and
he was arrested when he returned to Britain. He is already serving a 12-year
jail sentence in Scotland, imposed one month ago.
Martin, originally of Ballingry, Fife, yesterday admitted seven robberies and
two attempted robberies. Clements, of Stirling, admitted two robberies and one
attempted robbery.

INCREASED home ownership is not the sole answer to Scotland's housing needs,
the housing charity Shelter claimed yesterday.
It accused the Government of being obsessed with ownership compared to other
forms of housing tenure.
In 1981, 35% of Scots owned their own homes but, by 1994, largely as a result
of Government policies, that figure had risen to 57%. A target of 60% has been
set for the end of this Parliament.
Shelter questioned whether such a rate of growth, the fastest in Europe, could
be sustained. Home owners, it pointed out, share the Scottish problems of poor
repairs, low incomes, and debt.
Mr Gavin Corbett, Shelter research officer, also warned that the slump in the
housing market in England could easily spread north of the Border.
He said: ``Fortunately, Scottish home owners have not faced the same problems
of negative equity and repossessions.
``With a larger rented sector historically people on the lowest incomes have
had alternatives to a mortgage. It is vital that we protect that advantage.''
The charity is particularly concerned that people have no other choice but to
buy because of the lack of affordable rented accommodation.

A COOK and a cleaner were recovering yesterday from an ordeal in which they
were tied up at knifepoint by a masked man who had broken into a restaurant and
ambushed them.
The two women, aged 25 and 41, were not injured but were badly shaken by the
incident at the Brucefield Farm Restaurant in West Lothian.
It is thought the raider broke into the restaurant early on Sunday morning and
waited for staff to arrive. After demanding access to the manager's office, he
was disturbed by the arrival of a third employee and fled empty-handed.
He is described as aged 25-30, 5ft 6in, of medium build and wearing a green
balaclava, dark blue waterproof jacket, blue jeans, and white trainers.

<HEADLINE>Primaries to join scheme Forsyth wants more assisted places</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By BARCLAY McBAIN Education Correspondent</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974815276</RECORDNO>

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has targeted the junior, or primary,
departments of independent schools for his planned expansion of the
controversial assisted places scheme.
However, Labour reaffirmed its commitment to the phased abolition of assisted
places. Mrs Helen Liddell, who speaks for the party on Scottish education, said
it was a Government pitch to buy votes that did nothing for the 96% of pupils
who attended state schools.
Mr Brian Donohoe, Labour MP for Cunninghame South, said the scheme propped up
private schools. Nearly #10.5m was spent on assisted places last year. In the
14 years to 1994, costs increased by 1300% but the number of assisted pupils
increased by only 400%, he said.
Mr Forsyth, however, plans to spend an additional #9m over the next three years
on doubling the number, and yesterday he spelled out in more detail how he
expects to implement the expansion. The scheme gives less well-off families
financial assistance towards the cost of private schooling and, with a doubling
of places, could eventually cost the taxpayer about #20m a year.
For the first time, independent schools will be invited to bid for day places
for children aged below 10 in their junior departments.
The Scottish Office will also seek bids from private schools to increase their
number of assisted places, invite more schools to take part, and seek the
sector's views on expanding the scheme.
Mr Forsyth said: ``This expansion will provide greater choice for parents,
greater opportunity for their children, and will be welcomed by parents and
schools.''
He particularly wanted bids that would increase the number of children from
deprived areas, and whose families had the lowest incomes, at independent
schools.
Heads welcomed the additional funding but questioned whether the expansion
could be achieved in the short term and called on Mr Forsyth to meet the full
cost of assisted places, which they at present subsidised.
Given Labour's commitment to scrapping the scheme, heads are reluctant to put
themselves in a position where they rely too heavily on assisted places for
their funding.
Mr David Ward, head of Hutchesons' Grammar in Glasgow, said: ``We have turned
away pupils because we did not have Government funding, which can be quite sad
for bright children who would have benefited from the school.''
Mr Robin Easton, head of the High School of Glasgow, said: ``I welcome the
expansion, although I think schools will be wary because of political
uncertainty.''
Mr Donohoe said Daniel Stewart's and Melville College and the Mary Erskine
School in Edinburgh received more than #900,000 in assisted place payments last
year, with George Watson's receiving more than #750,000, George Heriot's School
nearly #700,000, and the High School of Dundee more than #590,000. He said:
``It cannot be right to spend more to educate a child privately than it costs
within a public-sector school.''
About 3000 assisted places are provided by 55 independent schools, which
receive full funding for about 50% of eligible pupils whose parents earn less
than #9545 a year.
q More school-leavers are finding full-time work, Scottish Education Minister
Raymond Robertson said yesterday as he announced the latest figures on what
young people do after leaving school.
The biggest proportion - 27% - went on to higher education, 24% went into
employment (3% up on 1993), 16% went on to further education, 16% into
training, 14% had known destinations - including unemployment - while 3% were
unaccounted for.

THE Clyde shipyard, Kvaerner Govan, yesterday received final confirmation that
it had landed a #60m contract which will secure the jobs of its 1300 staff for
the next two years.
The order, from the American Hughes Space and Communication Company, is to
build a vessel which will be used in the launch of commercial satellites from a
floating offshore base.
Workers on the Clyde will design and assemble the project's support and command
control ship, while Kvaerner's Stavanger yard will undertake the #50m
conversion of a semi-submersible vessel into a mobile rocket-launching platform.
The project, which is due to begin in the Pacific Ocean in 1998, is a
collaboration between the Kvaerner parent group, the US Boeing aircraft group,
Russian space company RSC Energia, and a Ukrainian rocket manufacturer, NPO
Yuzhnoye.
Mr Kjell Mikalsen, managing director of Kvaerner Govan, said the order would
put the Clyde yard in the forefront of world maritime technology.
``This contract is a tribute to the efforts made by the entire workforce at
Govan. Everyone has pulled out all the stops.''
The collaborative project, which is named Sea Launch, will operate out of Long
Beach in California and will be able to handle the largest satellites produced
by Hughes.
Mr Diderik Schnitler, executive vice-president of the Kvaerner group, said:
``Our position as a world leader in building special ships has made a crucial
contribution to the choice of this concept by Hughes.''

A DEVICE believed to be a bomb was discovered today outside an office of the US
tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service, and the building was evacuated.
The device, found in a white canister in the agency's car park, had a fuse
attached that had been lighted but had gone out, said police Lieutenant Ken
Bunker.
He estimated that an explosive device of that size could have damaged a number
of cars and blown out windows.
Authorities evacuated the two-storey IRS building in Reno, Nevada, and a
dentist's office next door.
Some 250 IRS employees were inside when the device was discovered early today,
said Larry Wright, an IRS spokesman.
Three bombings in the Reno-Carson City area in recent years have been aimed at
government targets.
The Bureau of Land Management building in Reno was bombed in October, 1993. Its
roof was heavily damaged, but the building was empty at the time.
On March 30, a pipe bomb slightly damaged the US Forest Service office in
Carson City. It, too, was unoccupied.
On August 4, a pipe bomb damaged the parked vehicle of Forest Service District
Director Guy Pence at his home in Carson City. He was away at the time, but his
family narrowly escaped injury.-AP.

SECURITY is being stepped up at Paul McCartney's #2m London mansion after it
was raided by burglars while he visited his wife in hospital.
The ex-Beatle said: ``This is unfortunately a common occurrence. This house has
been broken into many times during the past 30 years as this part of London is
a favourite area for burglars.
``Luckily, nothing of value was taken. We are improving the security but
obviously this incident doesn't help at a time like this.''
Burglars broke in through the back door of the house in St John's Wood, which
the couple use as their base when they are working in London.
Linda McCartney had a lump removed from her breast last week.
Paul, 54, said doctors first diagnosed the cancer 10 days ago and she underwent
surgery at the Princess Grace Hospital in London a week ago today.
``The doctors have said she will need a couple of months of recuperation - she
just needs peace and quiet at the moment.''
In a personal appeal to the press, he said: ``I have played ball with the press
but now I ask could the reporters and photographers please back off as our
family need to be very positive.
``If they don't back off, I believe that under the circumstances they will be
guilty of harassment and I promise I shall report them to the Press Complaints
Commission.''

MPs WERE trying yesterday to cope with the future, which seems to be rushing
towards us even faster than usual, bearing great events.
We are going to have to live with, it seems, not just the Millennium but also
with a single European currency even if the continentals start without us.
Labour's relentless quest to wrap up the votes of almost all classes of
citizenry apart from landed proprietors and privatised board members has
extended to the terraces, with their suggestion that football fans should be
elected to club boards.
Mr Tony Banks (Newham North-West - Lab.) joined Mrs Bottomley's highly
effective deputy at National Heritage, Mr Iain Sproat, in injecting a note of
realism. Given recent ructions in the Chelsea boardroom, it was not so much
supporter-directors who were needed as a UN peace keeping force, he suggested.
Mr Nick Hawkins (Blackpool South - Con.) demonstrated that some English Tories
other than the Prime Minister are taking devolution seriously by remembering to
wish Scotland as well as England good luck in the European Cup.
Faced with calls from several interested parties to place the main Millennium
celebration in their constituency the lovely Virginia said planning to
celebrate the twenty-first century's arrival was well advanced. She was aware,
she said, that the previous millennium had been presided over in England by
Ethelred the Unready and was determined to do better this time.
Improving on the record of Ethelred looked like a political ambition to which
even this Government might reasonably aspire and the Sketch is not damning with
faint praise when it records its opinions that Mr Major, reporting back on the
weekend's Madrid Euro summit, looked considerably more effective than that
monarch is reputed to have been.
Ethelred's monetary policy founded, it will be recalled on the over-supply of
``Danegeld'' which proved so popular with the Danes that they eventually took
the whole country over temporarily despite the protests of Euro-sceptical
Thanes.
Major's Britain could be remembered either for its resistance or submission to
the ``Eurogeld'' and whether it is to be peace or war Mr Major resolutely
refused to say. A hostile critic, Mr Tony Blair say, might have encapsulated
his critique in Churchill's biting criticism of the appeasing governments of
the thirties - "resolutely irresolute, adamant for drift.''
The Tories have, unusually, advertised their differences more effectively than
Labour. However, the Prime Minister had no shortage of material to demonstrate
that, both on principle and timing, the Opposition is in much the same straits
as the Government.
Labour's answer to Sir Teddy Taylor, Mr Peter Shore, praised Mr Major for
continuing to move in the right direction, causing looks of pain to cross the
faces of the more EU-friendly members of his Front Bench - that is to say far
from all of them.
Mr Major then turned really nasty when Mr Paddy Ashdown questioned his version
of events at Madrid. ``How do you know? Perhaps it was you who brought in the
tea, coffee and biscuits,'' he snapped. As he had virtually adopted the famous
``wait and see'' stance of Liberal Premier Asquith, this was perhaps cruel of
him.
It did, however, totally unite the Conservative Party, with the exception of Mr
Hugh Dykes (Harrow East), who achieves the substantial feat of being as pro-EU
as Mr Bill Cash is anti. He rebuked Mr Major for being so rude to Mr Ashdown.
However, over the hour of questioning, the Prime Minister appeared to convince
many of his supporters - in a way Ethelred never managed with the Thanes - that
waiting and seeing is perhaps sensible as well as a political necessity.
Ethelred just went on being Unready. John the Uncommitted will have to come off
the fence before the Millennium arrives but he's not ready to jump yet.

JENNIFER SAUNDERS and Joanna Lumley aren't expected to put in an appearance at
Scotland Street School but it's highly likely their alter egos would thoroughly
approve of the extravagant materials and costumes which feature in the
exhibition, Absolutely Fabulous, running at the Museum of Education in Glasgow
until January 7.
Conceived and researched by Jennifer Stevenson, the museum education service's
enthusiastic costumes and textile specialist, Absolutely Fabulous turns the
spotlight on fabric and shows how materials have been designed and fashioned
since the time of the industrial revolution to the present day.
As well as making full use of her department's own collection, Stevenson has
borrowed from a wide variety of sources including Strathclyde Police (anti-stab
jackets and bullet-proof vests), Scottish Ballet, and the world's foremost
manufacturer of space suits.
Loans from Paisley Museum show the evolution of the pattern that made the town
famous, from the fabulous shawls of the 19th century to its revival in the
swinging sixties when the Paisley pattern appeared on everything from gloves
and stockings to handbags and knickers.
Her research for the show took Stevenson to Switzerland and the studio of Jacob
Schlaepfer and Co where she saw designers working on a diamond-studded
headscarf for an Arabian princess and fabrics made from finely spun brass and
copper for the world's top couturiers.
Sharon Dent is a young textile designer who draws inspiration from such humble
sources as used envelopes, brown parcel paper and the pages of old ledgers.
Included in the exhibition is her clever shirt made from a copy of the London
Times.
Absolutely gorgeous are the tutus from Scottish Ballet with heavily embroidered
bodices and frothy skirts, each made from 12 metres of net and chiffon. Also on
loan from the company is a deceptively simple looking  Edwardian-style nightie
which actually took 30 hours to construct.
But if Pats and Eddie had their pic of the exhibits, I'll bet they'd go for the
gorgeous fabrics designed by Glasgow primary school pupils and the learning
support department at James Watt College. Following a single workshop session
at the Burrell where Jennifer Stevenson is based, the children went back to
school and, using sequins, glitter glue and feathers, produced lengths of
material (some made up into old fashioned crinoline) which looks delicious
enough to eat. Indeed, the design incorporating jelly babies and pasta shapes
probably could be eaten.

ANOTHER late attempt to prevent the Rail Franchise Director from announcing his
first passenger contracts will be made in the Appeal Court today.
Thurrock Borough Council in Essex together with local Labour MP Andrew
MacKinlay and backed by the Save Our Railways pressure group will seek to
overturn yesterday's High Court decision which denied them a stay on the
announcement of the sale of the LTS (London, Tilbury and Southend franchise
which has been rescheduled for today along with those of South-West Trains and
Great Western Trains.
Last Friday SOR's argument that sell-off procedures for four
soon-to-be-privatised lines were conducted illegally was upheld by Court of
Appeal judges. However, the judges said the group had not brought its case in
time for LTS Rail and the two other lines in the first batch to be privatised.
However, the judges said that the level of minimum passenger services for LTS
has also not been formulated in line with Government instructions and it was
this aspect that Thurrock sought unsuccessfully to exploit yesterday.
Railtrack yesterday confirmed proposals for a #1bn-a-year investment programme,
with the track authority saying it would invest #10bn over 10 years to upgrade
track, renew bridges, improve stations and modernise signalling equipment.
The announcement was seen as move aimed at calming anger among Tory
backbenchers at the lack of progress in the controversial sell-off. Seven
senior MPs are to demand action in a meeting with Transport Secretary Sir
George Young today, amid increasingly open calls for the complex privatisation
to be shelved.

THE SCOTTISH Drugs Forum yesterday said that drugs are becoming ``mainstream
youth culture,'' (writes Sarah Urquhart).
National development officer Lee Fawcett said: ``We have to recognise that is
the reality of the situation. We might not like it, but unless we deal with it
we can't remedy it.''
Her comments came as the forum launched guidelines to improve safety at raves
and other events. Its recommendations are aimed mainly at reducing risks of
dehydration and heat-stroke - common causes of ecstasy deaths.
The Guidelines for Good Practice at Dance Events, commissioned by the Scottish
Office, set out practical measures for organisers to improve safety, including
free drinking water, stopping overcrowding and moderating room temperatures.
Ms Fawcett said that the response from managers and club owners to the
guidelines had been positive, and added: ``A lot of operators want to know what
they can do to make things safer.''

AN unemployed woman was fined #750 and banned from driving for three years
after she admitted refusing three breath tests and driving while under the
influence of alcohol or drugs with an unrestrained child in the back of her car.
She also admitted failing to admit to police that she was the driver of the car.
Sheriff Noel McPartlin admonished her on the charge of neglect but ordered her
to resit her driving test.
He told her: ``I appreciate your were in the legal sense not unfit to drive
through drink or drugs but there was concern on the part of the police that you
had been drinking.''
The court had previously heard that the woman was spotted when she stopped her
red Volkswagen Golf to ask a passer-by for directions in Elgin.
The witness, a 22-year-old woman, saw the child sitting on the edge of the back
seat without a seatbelt.
The driver asked her for directions to a house in the town's Land Street but,
because her speech was ``somewhat slurred'', the woman became concerned.
When the police arrived at the house, the woman tried to ``deliberately avoid
contact with them'' and failed to state who the driver of the car had been when
it was spotted earlier in the evening.
Mr MacKay added: ``Officers asked the woman to give a specimen of breath but
she refused and gave no excuse. She was taken to Elgin police station and asked
again to give two specimens but once again refused.
``Police became concerned about the accused's fitness to look after the child
after the doctor found her to an extent to be under the influence of alcohol

THE spirit of goodwill was missing from a festive knees-up for employees and
officials of Glasgow City Council which ended in chaos at the weekend.
The dance came to an unceremonious halt, with more than 350 revellers in full
swing, as firefighters were called in answer to what turned out to be a hoax
alarm. In the ensuing melee, as people were leaving the building, a senior
council director was apparently assaulted and had to be taken to hospital.
The celebration had been organised by the council's highly successful credit
union, the largest in Britain with 7000 members. Held at the Winter Gardens, it
opened with an annual general meeting, followed by a buffet and then a disco.
However, the sounding of the fire alarm at midnight forced the organisers to
call a premature halt to the dance. As people spilled out of the building, Mr
David Angus, the director of City Building, a council department with 2500
employees and a budget of #85m, was attacked outside by a man wielding a bottle.
A spokesman for Mr Angus said the director was back at his desk yesterday. ``He
was assualted, he doesn't know who by. He was treated at hospital and the
matter has now been reported to the police.
``Mr Angus was at the function as a district council employee. This department
has been a great supporter of the credit union.''
The organiser of the event, Ms June Nightingale, manageress of the credit
union, said that, after the false alarm, the decision had been taken not to
continue with the dance.
``The fire alarm had gone off. The key holder had to be called out because it
is part of the People's Palace Museum and as there was only another hour to go
for the dance, it ended there.
``People were having a really good time. It was just a shame that the alarm
went off. They were disappointed but took the fact that the dance was ending in
good spirits and we were allowed back in to phone taxis and so on.''
Ms Nightingale said she saw nothing untoward and generally there had been no
problems with the dance. ``It was our first one and we're hoping it will become
an annual event,'' she added.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police said: ``We can confirm that a complaint has
been made regarding allegations of assault outside the People's Palace in
Glasgow around midnight on Friday.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Fire Brigade said they had attended a call out at
the People's Palace which had been a malicious call.

THOSE dreaming of a green Christmas are facing the harsh reality of a
consumerist Santa, ready as ever to slay us with the kind of goodies the
environment would rather not have dropped down its smokeless chimneys. Neither
is it easy being a dedicated environment-friendly foot soldier, weary of soul
in pursuit of Christmas presents that will ultimately please rather than
pollute.
In Glasgow, sales assistants were mostly ignorant of the attitude of their own
stores towards the green issue. At Hallmark Cards, for example, the assistant
concluded: ``Sorry we don't do anything like that.'' The response was similar
elsewhere. At John Menzies, amusement, and at the Globe gift shop, laughter.
Fraser's Christmas Shop had a ``Festive Garden'', complete with artificial
holly and plastic plants, although the store did have a redeeming stock of
recycled cards and seasonal napkins, bleached without chlorine and using
water-based colours - but the staff I spoke to knew little of these.
Even at Past Times, where gifts are inspired by Victorian, Tudor and medieval
days, harking back to perhaps more environmentally sound practices, there was
only a small selection of papier mache and wooden Christmas decorations.
After much searching and peering at labels at Marks and Spencer, I found
recycled gift wrap and tags produced using board from managed forests. Yet
three different assistants had firmly denied any knowledge of the products.
At Nash Stationers, where there were no recycled Christmas cards on display, a
spokesperson explained: ``There isn't a market for them. Our customers, from
offices and print services, want quality, not the dull white effect of recycled
paper.''
There was relief, though, at Body Shop, where they were very knowledgeable
about green Christmas goods on display and spoke enthusiastically: ``Recycling
is very important.''
Essentially, the green consumer must scrutinise labels and packaging. All the
card shops I visited had a wide selection of environment-friendly Christmas
cards, despite the assistants' denials.
Traditional gift items are often made from over-packaged, non-renewable
materials, with many produced by slave labour. Green societies, such as Friends
of the Earth recommend buying gifts from local craftspeople or from places
selling Third World products which actually benefit their manufacturers.
Children spend much of Christmas fighting ``the enemy'' on computer screens.
Environmentalists favour non-violent toys. In 1987, Finland became the first
country to ban the sale of toys which resembled offensive military weaponry.
The Early Learning Centre operate a ``no tanks, no guns'' policy, avoiding toys
which blatantly express violence.
The Americans were the first to explore this area when the Californian based
New Games Foundation pioneered co-operative basketball and football in the
mid-seventies. Board games soon followed.
Essentially, the green Christmas consumer should buy cards and envelopes made
from recycled paper or derived from sustainable forests. Re-use is also
encouraged. Gift paper, bows and ribbons can be used several times. Old
Christmas cards can be cut into gift tags for next year's gifts or mounted on
new sheets of paper and used as thankyou cards for gifts received.
Natural resources such as evergreens, fir cones, tissue paper and candles can
be used as effective decorations instead of plastic, foil and artificial
lighting.
Wrapping paper should be used sparingly. Creative gift wrap can be fashioned
from magazines, Sunday supplement pages, painted backs of shopping bags or even
fabric. Children may not appreciate good gift papers - consider wrapping theirs
in pages from old comics or odd pieces of wallpaper.
Toys and gifts should be useful, durable and made from natural materials.
Wooden toys, although expensive, will last several generations. ``Green shops''
and Third World organisations cater for environment-friendly giving.

The state of our relationships, current fashions and even our sense of humour -
it's all on the cards, as JANE SCOTT discovers
THERE was a study in America during the 70s when psychologists sent Christmas
cards to total strangers, being careful to include their address, signing them
with appropriate messages like ``Love from Peter and Jane and the kids'' or
``Best wishes from Dr and Mrs Lewis''.
Surprisingly, the recipients often sent cards back. And the fictitious Dr and
Mrs Lewis, who obviously had more social status than poor Peter and Jane, got
sackloads of them.
There's a theory in psychology called equity, which means that people feel an
overwhelming need to keep things balanced in a relationship (also explaining
why you feel guilty when a relatively minor friend presents you with a totally
unexpected package, or malingeringly resentful when the splendid Christmas
present to your brother is reciprocated by a mere card).
As a method of communication, Christmas cards are hard to beat. This year, we
will send 1.4 billion of them, and they account for 65 per cent of all the
cards sold in the UK (although only 35 per cent of the money spent - that's
because people stock up on the dirt cheap multi-packs. These thrive because
people feel guilty sending the same thing to everyone, just in case Auntie
Elsie clocks an identical card to hers on your mother's mantelpiece.)
Sending and receiving cards constitutes a social contract that everyone
understands, said Oxford psychologist Rachel Reeves.
``It's a way of networking. If you send a Christmas card to somebody you
haven't seen for a while you don't have to put a letter in with it. It's a very
controlled way of communicating with somebody, where they know the rules and
you know the rules.
``People need to keep their social network as wide as possible, and all they
need to do is send a Christmas card to keep the contact.''
Businesses send cards knowing they will get no reply - but Reeves reckons that
the law of equity means recipients will feel in some way obliged, and may
reward the company with contracts during the coming year.
As for the scenes on the cards themselves, the industry recognises three
genres; traditional, cute and humorous, which forms only a tiny part of the
Christmas range. Fashions change over the years, and art directors in the card
companies send out strict orders to the artists dictating the company's range.
Accrington company Hambledon Studios, a big player in the market, is cutting
down on cute this year. Traditional is back in, with the time-honoured reds,
greens, embossed golds and scarlet ribbons.
Reeves thinks the plethora of Dickensian carriages reflects not only our desire
to keep in touch with our recent past - our circle of friends - but also our
society's more distant past, a time when communities were not fragmented, a
mythical time of harmonious co-existence Christmas cards try vainly to recreate.
The launch of the Andrew Brownsword Forever Friends range a few years ago saw
an explosion in cuddly hedgehogs and baby badgers across the market, and
Hambledon's big seller this year is the ``juvenile'' Christmas Club card - an
idea from Edinburgh songwriter Bob Heatlie.
Finding himself on hard times after penning songs like Merry Christmas Everyone
for Shakin' Stevens, he came up with the idea of a Christmas tape for children,
part of a #1.99 package which includes a cute card (hedgehogs in scarves and
teddy bears in duffle coats), a badge bearing the child's name, and, crucially,
a tape with Santa singing to the child, again using his or her name. The
company expects to sell 200,000 this Christmas - a runaway success.
``They are well produced,'' said Heatlie, ``and the little kiddiwinks just love
to hear their name spoken by these characters.'' The Birthday Club range, which
sells the rest of the year, has taken sales over the 2million mark, said
Heatlie - ``and Hambledon reckons this is just the tip of the iceberg''.
Dr Geoff Scobie of Glasgow University says cute cards ``may be expressing
something sentimental that (the sender) may feel is beneath humans, so you have
teddy bears saying these things instead''.
Scobie sees Christmas cards and presents as a substitute for being together,
with the obvious expense in elaborate, embossed, inlaid cards an attempt to
``do the right thing''. Choosing religious scenes or charity cards, however,
while observing the ritual of separation, may try to assuage guilt for
``spending so much money on what is a relatively trivial thing''.
At the other end of the scale are people who go to great expense to have cards
made for them, with a message and signature printed inside; a sure sign of
status, reciprocated on the other side of the letter box by the people who
ostentatiously display the huge numbers of cards they have received.
Some families, notes Reeves, are more comfortable with the Christmas card
ritual than others. They accept the separation, reject concepts like guilt,
status and its attendant expense, and get the personal message across - by
making their own Christmas cards.

HUGH DOUGHERTY gets on the right tracks for a merry Christmas with a ticket to
ride on Santa's Polar Express
CENTRAL Scotland's only steam-powered iron-horse has been breaking festive
records on the Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway. So far this year more than 8000
passengers have boarded Santa's Polar Express for the train ride to meet Mr
Claus in person.
``We're delighted with the numbers,'' says chief organiser Roger Haynes. ``For
#4.50 for adults, and #4.00 for children and age concessions, we guarantee
every passenger will have a personal audience with Santa himself as the train
runs to Kinneil and back.
``There's a gift for every child and mince pies and hot coffee for the adults.
And we throw in a train crew full of Christmas cheer who'll lead you in carols
and Santa songs.''
A massive amount of organisation goes into running Santa's Polar Express, which
is steam powered, of course.
Chief gnome, Andrea Morison of Edinburgh, also a primary school teacher,
organises the gifts, stocks the guard's van grotto, and makes sure Mr Claus
reaches every child in each coach and compartment, as the train chuffs steadily
up the grade to Kinneil.
She's helped by another teacher, Norman Girvan. With bell on Santa cap
tingling, he pleads: ``Please don't say which schools we teach in - the kids
will never let us live it down!''
However, the duo really know what they're about, and Santa's regal progress
through the train goes like clockwork.
Young eyes light up as Santa, preceded by carol-singing gnomes, shouts out
``Ho, ho, ho!'' above the clunk of train wheels on rail joints, and backed by
the muffled exhaust of the engines, veterans of 1893 and 1954, which echo off
the cutting walls.
The excitement is tangible as Santa completes his rounds and finally closes the
last door of the last compartment.
``It's hard work doing this every weekend in December right up to Christmas
Eve,'' admits the great man. ``But we're determined to make it a train ride to
remember for kids, mums, dads, grandparents, aunties and uncles.''
Truly memorable is how 52 passengers of all ages from Newbattle Parish Church
in Edinburgh voted their first trip on a Santa Special.
``It was wonderful,'' commented the Rev Jared Hay, reflecting on his Sunday
school charges' reaction to their first trip on a privatised railway. ``We'll
be back next year for a return trip.''
In the meantime, Santa and his helpers - not forgetting the engine drivers,
firemen, guards, and booking clerks, each one a volunteer - will be back on the
tracks with Santa's Polar Express between Bo'ness and Kinneil this Saturday and
Sunday. Trains will also run on December 23 and 24.
``Running on Christmas Eve will be hard going for Santa,'' admits Roger Haynes,
``but he's promised he can fit us in before he starts deliveries with his
reindeer-powered sleigh. We've had to promise him the trains will run to strict
time, so he's not late for his busiest night of the year. But we've no worries
- steam power will keep him on the right track.''
Booking in advance is recommended for the Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway Santa
Special trains. Telephone: 01383-822944 for full details.

<HEADLINE>Hindley letter condemned as a publicity stunt</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974815289</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LETTER written by Moors murderer Myra Hindley to a national newspaper taking
``full responsibility'' for the part she played was yesterday condemned as a
publicity stunt and forerunner to a parole application.
In the letter to the Guardian from Durham Jail, 53-year-old Hindley confessed
she was ``corrupt, wicked, and evil'' when she committed the murders 30 years
ago.
She also said that in some respects she was ``more culpable'' than her lover
and co-murderer, Ian Brady.
Publication was criticised by the chairman of the Tory back-bench media
committee, Mr Roger Gale, who called on the Home Secretary to consider curbing
prisoners' access to the media.
He said: ``I am becoming increasingly and very genuinely concerned at the
manner in which convicted criminals are given access to a media desperate for
salacious stories to assist them in their circulation war.
``What has been published today is in fact a 5000-word publicity stunt on
behalf of a murderess.''
The letter to the Guardian came after the newspaper invited the killer to
justify earlier claims that she was not a psychopath.
Former Moors murders detective Peter Topping said he believed the letter was
part of a build-up to a parole application.
Hindley wrote: ``I wasn't mad, so I must have been bad, became bad by a slow
process of corruption...... I was the more culpable.''
She reasoned: ``If we had not met, there would have been no murders, no crime
at all. I would probably have got married, had children, and now be a
grandmother.''
Hindley was jailed for life in 1966 with Brady for killing Lesley Ann Downey,
10, and Edward Evans, 17. Brady was also convicted of murdering John Kilbride,
12. They later admitted killing Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, 12.
Hindley's former solicitor Andrew McCooey dismissed suggestions she was making
a bid for freedom.
``No, I don't believe it is,'' he told BBC-TV's Breakfast News. ``About a year
ago, the Home Secretary announced that she would never get her freedom and I
think by and large she's come to terms with that.''
Lord Longford, who has campaigned on behalf of Hindley for decades, told
Breakfast News he believed she would eventually be released.

PUBLIC Service Minister Roger Freeman last night insisted there were no plans
for compulsory job cuts in the run-up to the sale of Her Majesty's Stationery
Office.
Tory Sir Patrick Cormack said he was opposed to the privatisation and called
for the publication of parliamentary papers to be kept within the control of
Parliament.
Mr Tam Dalyell (Linlithgow - Lab.) said he was worried about security and
reliability of staff employed by any privatised printing firms, as they would
be dealing with sensitive documents such as the Budget Speech.

<HEADLINE>Government unveils licensing powers aimed at making raves safer Labour seeks drug-free school zones</HEADLINE>

LABOUR is to press ahead with proposals to have special drug-free cordons
thrown around Scotland's schools in an attempt to dissuade drug dealers,
despite Government scepticism about the idea.
The proposal is one of the few areas of disagreement among Scotland's four
major parties, which are showing remarkable unity in an attempt to beat the
drugs menace among Scotland's teenagers.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth already has had discussions with the leaders
of Labour, the Scottish National Party, and the Scottish Liberal Democrats in
the hope of achieving all-party support for initiatives against drug abuse next
year.
Labour's Shadow Scottish Home Affairs Spokesman John McFall wants to go one
step further, however, and introduce legislation which would mean that anyone
convicted of drug dealing within a quarter-of-a-mile of a school automatically
would face a harsher sentence - perhaps even double the normal fine or prison
sentence.
He will put it forward as an amendment to the Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland)
Bill currently going through Parliament, which will give local authorities
wider powers to control raves being organised in their areas.
Scottish Minister of State Lord James Douglas-Hamilton is not convinced. He
said yesterday that the Government wanted drug-free areas to cover the whole of
Scotland.
Mr McFall denied that his suggestion simply would move any drugs problem to
other streets. ``It has already proven a success in America,'' he said.
``Creating a drug-free area around schools combined with the proper education
of the pupils about the dangers of drugs can have an effect.''
The Bill he wants to amend was debated in Glasgow's City Chambers yesterday by
the Scottish Grand Committee, as part of the Prime Minister's initiative to
make the workings of Parliament more accessible to the Scottish people.
Minister of State Lord James Douglas-Hamilton emphasised that the Bill was not
designed to have raves banned, but to give licensing boards the power to make
them as safe as possible for the young people attending.
``Many rave organisers in Scotland already act in a responsible way, but some
unfortunately do not. They are willing to turn a blind eye to drug-dealing and
to compromise the safety of their customers for the sake of a quick profit. The
Bill will ensure that in future such people will not be able to get away with
such unscrupulous behaviour.''
The Bill gives licensing boards the power to make by-laws setting out
conditions for the safeguarding of the health of people attending raves.
The City Chambers debate at times centred on the vagueness of the definition of
what a rave actually is.
Mr McFall, for Labour, claimed that the proposed legislation was so vague it
could apply to the Last Night of the Proms.
The Bill refers to events in licensed premises at which music is played and
where there is the opportunity for dancing - but where it also appears to the
licensing board that drug offences may take place.
Lord James emphasised that this did not condone drug use, but would ensure that
raves were targeted, rather than innocuous dances.
One suggestion is that licensing boards may use the legislation to ensure that
a plentiful free water supply is available at raves. It is the dehydration
caused by drug abuse combined with continuous energetic dancing which has led
to some drug deaths.
Already the chairman of Glasgow's licensing board, Mr James Coleman, says he is
extremely concerned at the Government's line. ``It is all very well for the
Government to take action to ensure adequate provision of water and cool-off
points at venues. But this approach is a fundamental acceptance that drugs are
freely available and used by young people at dance and rave venues.''
Such was the unanimity among the parties that it was Labour MP George Foulkes
(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley), who defended the legislation against Mr
Coleman's attack, stating it was ``absolute nonsense'' to suggest the
legislation condoned drugs.
``Just because you have fire extinguishers in the City Chambers does not mean
that you are condoning arson attacks,'' he pointed out.
Although no MP voted against the Bill at the Grand Committee meeting, there are
concerns that it does not go far enough in the fight against drugs. Lord James
conceded it was limited, but every step, no matter how small, was welcome, he
said, and that it would send out a signal that the Government would take
whatever measures were necessary to curb drug abuse in Scotland.
SNP MP Roseanna Cunningham (Perth and Kinross) raised concerns that if
licensing boards applied the law differently then drug pushers might migrate to
areas where it was felt that the laws were not so harshly applied. Other boards
may apply punitive measures which would virtually halt raves taking place on
licensed premises.
Labour's Sam Galbraith (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) was worried that the Bill
was simply a health and safety measure and would do nothing to stop drug abuse.
However, the Government will bring forward further measures next year including
better education on the dangers of drugs, and drop-in centres, like the one
planned at Provan in Glasgow which would try to build young people's
self-confidence and help them find jobs.
As Lord James put it, the measures were just ``another brick in the wall'' the
Government was building to protect young people from drug abuse. Perhaps an
unfortunate choice of phrase, as Another Brick in the Wall was a big hit for
Pink Floyd, which many a drug-using fan played in his or her bed-sit in the
seventies.
Not that the Minister was howled down for using such a phrase. Yesterday all
the political parties were singing the same tune.

THE Transport Secretary bowed to the courts yesterday and announced he would
redraft the rules governing the rail sell-off, but insisted the compromise in
no way would undermine the Government's commitment to its most contentious
privatisation.
In the latest political humiliation to hit the Tories as a result of rail
privatisation, Sir George Young was forced to go before MPs to announce the
changes suggested by the Court of Appeal last week.
Pressed by Labour, he refused to abandon the privatisation and insisted it
would provide better services for passengers.
Labour reacted angrily, accusing the Government of changing the rules to suit
its ends. Shadow Transport spokesman Brian Wilson said: ``Instead of changing
the policy they have changed the law. That which was illegal before is now
miraculously legal.
``It treats the courts with as much contempt as they have treated Parliament
and the railways users.''
Last week, the Court of Appeal ruled that four of the first seven franchises
being offered for sale were unlawful because the Rail Franchising Director Mr
Roger Salmon had failed to follow ministerial advice on minimum standards of
service.
Although the Government disputes the ruling, the Department of Transport has
agreed to redraft the instructions in order to preserve the minimum Passenger
Service Requirements (PSRs) announced for each franchise due to be sold.
The new rules will make clear that future bidders will be assessed in part on
their willingness to provide services above and beyond the legal minimum set by
the Franchising Director.
Sir George told MPs: ``Our concern is to ensure that passengers should be
allowed to enjoy the benefits which franchising will bring as soon as possible.
The Government's policy has been clear and consistent and I can assure the
House there will be no change in this as a result of last Friday's judgment.''
The Transport Secretary insisted the court had not questioned the Government's
policy and had described Mr Salmon's approach to developing PSRs as
``intelligible and in no way irrational''. The problem had been a discrepancy
between ministerial instructions and the resulting PSRs.
``I have therefore decided to clarify the instructions and guidance to Mr
Salmon to ensure they reflect beyond doubt the policy which we have always
followed: that is that franchisees should have flexibility to adjust commercial
services while ensuring through the Franchise Agreement that a core service
level is protected so that service levels operated by franchisees will be
broadly similar to those operated immediately prior to franchising.''
Shadow Transport Secretary Clare Short said: ``Your statement amounts to an
admission that the early franchises prepared by Mr Salmon, who is of course a
creature of yours, didn't guarantee services as good as those currently
provided by British Rail.''

EXCLUSIVE
THE Loch Lomond by-laws, subject to much delay and controversy over five years,
have been ratified by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, and will come into
force on February 1.
An announcement is expected today that, apart from a few changes made by
Scottish Office lawyers to make the regulations easier to implement, the
by-laws will be those drafted by Stirling and Dumbarton District Councils with
the aim of reducing conflict between speed boats and traditional users,
including anglers, canoeists, yachtsmen, and day cruisers.
A late objection by the Scottish Sports Council, viewed as a bid to win carte
blanche for water ski-ing interests, has effectively been set aside by the
Scottish Secretary.
The measures are not being hailed as a full answer to Loch Lomond's problems.
Many believe the long-term solution is a national park structure with planning
powers.
Mr Sam Galbraith, Labour MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, is to introduce a
Ten Minute Rule Bill into the Commons at the first opportunity, setting out the
case for a Loch Lomond national park and laying down a marker on his party's
future plans for the loch.
Mr John McFall, Labour MP for Dumbarton, welcomed the by-laws yesterday, but
added: ``The ultimate aim on Loch Lomond has to be sustainability of any
activity and to ensure this we need a national park.''
After February, every powered craft using the loch will have to be registered
with the Loch Lomond Park Authority. Apart from 10 specified areas set aside
for water skiers, a speed limit of 6mph will apply up to 150 metres from each
shore.
This has been designed to allow the oldest traditional sport, angling for
salmon and sea trout, to take place in relative peace. The last 10 years have
seen one of the world's legendary fisheries almost totally destroyed by the
explosion in water ski-ing, jet ski-ing, and power boating.
Although there was optimism yesterday from the 150-year-old Loch Lomond Angling
Improvement Association, it faces a struggle as many of its members have given
up in the face of the disturbance.
Anglers still face problems, however, with the by-laws imposing a speed limit
of 90kph (50mph) over the rest of the loch surface, meaning speed boats have
virtual control of more than 90% of the water.
Some sensitive areas of the loch, including The Narrows and The Geggle between
and around Inchtavannich, Inchconnachan, Inchcruin, and Inchmoan have been
subject to speed controls for both safety and conservation considerations.
Mr Forsyth visited the loch earlier this month and said the measures were a
perfect example of ``local solutions to local problems''.
He is believed to have asked the authority to monitor the effects of the
by-laws and review them after two seasons.
Councillor Duncan Mills, chairman of the Loch Lomond Park Authority, said: ``I
am very pleased that sanity has now been introduced into the situation on Loch
Lomond. Our new patrol boat and waterborne ranger service will be able to
assist in calming down the conflicts of interest. Adjustments may have to be
made to the by-laws in future but they shall be done in the light of experience
gained over the next two summer seasons.''
The authority looked forward, he said, to working with the Scottish Sports
Council, Scottish Natural Heritage, and others in monitoring the effect on
behaviour.
The Loch Lomond Angling Improvement Association is also to ask its members to
monitor speed boat behaviour and to make formal reports.
Mr Hamish Campbell, the association chairman, said: ``Hopefully, the loch will
have a chance to get back to normal over the next few years. Our members will
be taking a very strong and active part. Our membership has suffered badly from
speed boating, but hopefully those who have given up will now come back.''
Mr Ian Davis, chairman of Loch Lomond Water Ski Association, said it welcomed
the by-laws as a major help to the authority in getting hooligans off the loch.
The 150-metre speed limit were an unwarranted restriction, he said, because the
loch was quiet most of the time.
His 500-strong association, Mr Davis said, was producing a booklet for water
skiers to raise awareness of the needs of anglers and he was optimistic that
there would be an end to conflict.
Swan song for the Loch Lomond free-for-all: new by-laws aim to preserve the
serenity of the loch by imposing speed limits.

<HEADLINE>Bottomley reveals regulator was advised not to accept free travel on trip to America Lottery chief `warned on flights'</HEADLINE>

THE pressure to sack Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National Lottery,
increased last night after the disclosure that warnings were made in advance
that flights taken during his trip to the US should not be paid for by Oflot's
hosts.
The revelation came in a Commons reply only hours after his meeting with
National Heritage officials over his admission that he accepted free flights
from GTech, a Camelot stakeholder.
Mr Davis has been fighting to retain his job since he told the Commons Public
Accounts Committee a week ago that he accepted internal flights around America
from GTech.
The disclosure about the warning was made by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, National
Heritage Secretary, in a written reply.
Now, MPs are mystified why she did not mention this when she came under intense
pressure during Commons exchanges earlier.
Then, she told Labour MPs who were baying for Mr Davis's blood, that she would
not make a ``knee-jerk'' decision about Mr Davis's future, but said she wanted
to consider the matter carefully and report back to MPs in due course.
She described Mr Davis as a highly-regarded professional.
However, Mr John McWilliam, Labour MP for Blaydon, said: ``Mr Davis has got to
go.''
He added: ``I begin to wonder whether Mr Davis actually understood what public
service was all about, or indeed the clear advice he got from department
officials.
``Clearly, he decided to ignore it and the responsibility for ignoring it is
his and nobody else's. He cannot be regarded as a suitable person to undertake
such onerous responsibilities.''
Mrs Bottomley said in her written reply: ``In August 1994, in discussing the
director-general's proposed US trip, officials of my department advised that
the director-general would need to ensure that all due propriety was observed
and that the cost of flights and accommodation should be borne by Oflot and not
their hosts.
``Oflot is a non-ministerial department and therefore responsible for
implementing its own hospitality and travel arrangements taking into account
the principles and rules set out in the Civil Service Management Code.
``Oflot is under no obligation to clear with, or inform my department, about
its detailed arrangements.''
The #84,000-a-year watchdog had told the Commons committee the flights were
made after Camelot had been chosen to run the lottery, and he had saved
taxpayers a lot of money.
Yesterday, Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West, pressed Mrs Bottomley:
``It's a week now since Mr Davis indicated that he had taken free trips from a
company he is supposed to be monitoring.
``You would have been aware of that within hours. Why is it that a week later,
you're still standing here and saying you can't make up your mind whether he
should go or whether he should stay?
``Most considered opinion is that the man should go, not for dishonesty, but
for sheer lack of judgment.''
Mrs Bottomley, insisting a knee-jerk reaction would be inappropriate, added
that the lottery had been extremely successful and was highly regarded around
the world.
``I have made quite clear that I will report in due course to the House when I
have had time to consider the details involved.''
Shadow National Heritage Secretary Dr Jack Cunningham demanded to know if Mrs
Bottomley thought Mr Davis was fulfilling his key public duties of maximising
proceeds from the lottery, and ensuring the lottery was run with all due
propriety.
Mrs Bottomley said a National Audit Office report had described the
director-general of Oflot's work in very high terms.
She added: ``I do not intend to take precipitate action. It would be
inappropriate and unfair to say more on this matter today. I will, however,
report to the House in due course.''

<HEADLINE>Ministers set to shrug off fishing vote</HEADLINE>

THE Government is preparing to shrug off a possible defeat tonight on European
fishing policy. There were indications that it might narrowly avoid defeat as
some Tory Euro-sceptic MPs were coy about their intentions last night.
There are fears that a meeting of EU fisheries ministers in Brussels on
Thursday could sanction huge cuts in catches next year which could see the
industry in some traditional fishing towns close down entirely.
Ministers have been promising potential rebels that they will be fighting hard
at the meeting to prevent cuts designed to make way for the entry of more
Spanish vessels into what were previously British territorial waters.
One Tory rebel, Mr John Wilkinson (Ruislip-Northwood), tabled a motion calling
for the UK to declare a 200-mile exclusion zone in which it would be up to
Britain to decide who would be allowed to fish there.
This would be backed by several Conservative MPs but is unlikely to be called
for a vote by the Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd, at the end of the three-hour
debate.
Labour hopes of attracting rebel Tories to support its carefully crafted motion
were fading last night after a number of Tories let it be known that they did
not plan to support an Opposition they regard as at least as EU-friendly as the
Government.
Opposition hopes of defeating the Government hang on the Ministers' own motion
which will simply ask MPs to ``take note'' of fishing developments in the EU in
the past year. The debate is an annual event and Government spokesmen were
denying that defeat would involve a vote of confidence tomorrow.
Some Tory MPs from fishing areas, such as Mr David Harris (St Ives), said they
would await the outcome of the Brussels negotiations, which indicates their
votes may be safe for the Government.
Mr Major's strong performance in his statement on the latest EU summit in
Madrid also may have persuaded wavering backbenchers to support the Government.
Shadow Fisheries Minister Gavin Strang called on Tory MPs to ``stand up for our
fishing industry''.
The SNP, in a motion also unlikely to be called for a vote, called for a
rethink of the decommisioning policy to ensure an adequate scrap-and-build
programme.
However, up to half-a-dozen and perhaps more Labour MPs are expected to miss
the vote through illness or other causes.
The Labour amendment tabled last night calls on the Government to work to
reform the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure conservation and fair allocation
of fish stocks along with effective enforcement.

THE most popular name for baby girls this year is Charlotte, while boys'
parents opt for the more traditional Thomas, according to a survey yesterday.
Thomas has topped the list of boys' names in the Times birth announcements
since 1992, closely followed by James, Alexander, and William.
Charlotte moved up from number 10 last year to knock Sophie into second place.
Hannah and Isabella make an entrance for the first time in the top 10 at number
nine and 10. For boys, there was little change from last year with James,
Alexander, and William holding onto the number two, three and four spots. Jack
creeps in at number 10.
The top 10, with last year's position in brackets: boys - 1 Thomas (1), 2 James
(2), 3 Alexander (3), 4 William (4), 5 Oliver (6), 6 George (7), 7 Charles (5),
8 Henry (9), 9 Edward (8), 10 Jack (-); girls - 1 Charlotte (10), 2 Sophie (1),

BY the time you read this, I will doubtless know the worst. My four-year-old
son will have held his crook meekly at his side as humble shepherds are
supposed to; or he will have poked it in Joseph's stomach and subverted the
entire nursery school nativity by playing the shepherd as some demented Power
Ranger in a dressing-gown.
I will either be dizzy with relief or burning with shame. Either way I will be
wishing he could have been cast as something nice and innocuous like his little
cousin in London, who came home from nursery the other day to announce he would
be starring as a mince pie. My sister is having nightmares about the costume,
but at least she doesn't have to worry about what he'll do with his stick or
how to stop him lobbing the glowing embers of the shepherds' campfire into the
manger.
This is always an anxious time for parents. More finger-nails are chewed over
whether fidgety angels will keep their wings straight or pint-sized narrators
will remember how to pronounce Caesar Augustus than over just about anything
since their first day at school.
My first experience of this festive stress came when our eldest made his stage
debut several years ago as a donkey. Resplendent in brown tights, a furry
waistcoat and an extremely life-like mask his father had been up all night
making, he took his place on a step behind the holy couple and would have
contributed to a very pretty tableau if the ox had not also decided to strike a
pose on the same step. Ox and ass began to fight.
You can always detect the offenders' parents in these circumstances. While
shoulders heave and giggles erupt around them, they are the ones gazing with
mute appeal at the stage or looking around self-consciously with an apologetic
``These-things-will-happen'' shake of the head. In my case, I was also - if
truth be told - willing the donkey to win. The ox, whom anybody could see had
started the whole thing, had a sharp elbow and my maternal hackles were rising.
Eventually, the infant teacher stepped in and separated the combatants.
Everyone later agreed it had been one of the most entertaining nativity plays
for years.
The following year the occasion would have passed without mishap if I had not
had to bring a baby to the afternoon performance. When he began to wiggle on my
knee, I thought I would just let him crawl around for a while at my feet while
the action proceeded on stage. How was I to know the three kings were due to
pass by my chair on their stately way to Bethlehem? Balthazar and Melchior made
a deft detour around the baby and continued with dignity intact, but their pal
never saw what hit him. His feet went and his crown clattered to the floor. We
left hurriedly.
The next year our second son clocked up a family first - a speaking role.
``There is no room at the inn,'' he yelled - they had been told to speak up -
and I nearly expired with pride. Just as you always know at a glance whose
children are playing up, you can spot the proud ones at a hundred yards. Their
faces are suffused with the most perfect, blissful satisfaction. It's not
smugness, nor merely relief; I reckon it's the purest and most innocent
revelling in the achievement of another that adults are capable of. I still go
all gooey with emotion when I remember my tiny innkeeper, all bright-eyed and
eager, delivering his one pathetic line like Henry V rousing his men at
Agincourt.
Partisanship is of course the order of the day. I love the way that, whatever
the shortcomings, perfectly obvious to every other member of the audience, all
parents are secretly convinced their little petal is the prettiest angel, the
best singer, the sweetest shepherd (aaargh, shepherds - mustn't think of
shepherds!) the most handsome soldier, the juiciest mince pie. I also love the
way teachers who have done it dozens of times before throw themselves into it
like Trevor Nunn producing the Hamlet of a lifetime.
And I especially love the magic that somehow escapes from mumbled lines and
murdered tunes and battered halos to invite you, compel you, to share the
wonder of it all.
Christmas without wonder has always seemed to me a pretty hollow affair. It's
not that you necessarily need to have children around, but there's no doubt
that when they are, it's easier to catch the infection and discover your own
capacity to marvel.
There is nothing guaranteed a bigger laugh in our house than to look back at a
video we once shot of our Christmas festivities: the lovingly prepared festive
table reduced to debris within minutes, the feverish toddler whose wails
drowned out the carols, the big, black rings of exhaustion around my eyes, the
eternal squabbling over new toys, the dishwasher overflowing.
But there's a point in the video where we always stop laughing. It's when we
watch the faces of the children carrying their candles - ever so carefully -
through to the Christmas Eve table, singing Away in a Manger, and exuding that
wide-eyed wonder that is the best part of childhood and maybe, if we can retain
it or rediscover it, the salvation of our adulthood. It is a frame of mind that
enables us to marvel at the actual claim of Christmas which, unless the central
tenet of Christianity is completely off-the-wall, is utterly mind-boggling.
Children's minds are easily boggled by Christmas. What's a brawling donkey or a
dropped crown when you can touch the stars? Or, come to that, what's a
delinquent shepherd on his last warning? I will worry no longer.

THE Princess Royal's son Peter Phillips escaped injury when a car he was
driving was involved in a multiple crash on the M6, police confirmed last night.
The 18-year-old Gordonstoun School pupil was driving from Scotland to his
mother's home at Gatcombe Park, Gloucester, for Christmas when the accident
happened at Nether Wyresdale, near Lancaster, on Sunday afternoon.
Peter and three friends in the Peugeot 405 he was driving were uninjured in the
crash.
Police said it appeared that Peter, due to make his Scotland schools rugby
international debut against France in Edinburgh on Friday, had been forced to
brake sharply.
Another car had collided with the car behind, pushing it into the Peugeot which
was then pushed into the car in front of it. The vehicles were badly damaged.

FORMER prisoners-of-war, who were held by Japan during the Second World War,
reacted with shock last night to the announcement that Defence Secretary
Michael Portillo is to visit Japan next month to boost military links.
The visit comes just weeks before veterans go to court in Japan to try to win
compensation for their appalling treatment in labour camps.
Mr Arthur Titherington, secretary of the Japanese Labour Camp Survivors'
Association, said: ``I'm shocked that a member of this Government could be
having military discussions with the Japanese when their government has failed
to resolve all the outstanding grievances that still hang over from the war.''
Mr Martyn Day, solicitor for the association and the Association of British
Civilian Internees, said they had received assurances of support from the Prime
Minister and his Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind for their fight for justice.
``How can the same Government be sending out the Secretary of State for Defence
when we expect to be in court on these issues early next year?'' he said.
Mr Portillo will meet Ministers and officials for talks during his visit on
January 7-9.
There is likely to be an agreement to increase the number of joint exercises
and exchanges between Britain and Japan.
Following the 50th anniversary of the VJ Day commemorations, the Government is
keen to forge a new military relationship with one of the world's strongest
economies.
Meanwhile, Japan's prime minister yesterday used a long-delayed ceremony
marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War to offer
condolences to those who died.
However, he stopped well short of an earlier acknowledgement of his country's
wartime aggression.

THE Princess of Wales will spend Christmas away from her sons and the rest of
the royal family.
The princess's about-turn, if not intended to be a snub to the Queen, will be
seen as a further worsening of relations between the estranged princess and her
royal in-laws.
News that the Princess of Wales will not, as originally planned, spend
Christmas at Sandringham came as the Prince of Wales was out riding with the
same hunt as his friend Camilla Parker Bowles.
The prince and Mrs Parker Bowles were careful not to be seen together, with the
prince joining the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt near Highgrove House, his
Gloucestershire home, hours after the start.
Mrs Parker Bowles, 48, rode with around 100 riders for about two hours before
returning at lunchtime to Highgrove where she stables her horses. Half an hour
after her departure, the Prince of Wales joined the hunt.
Of the princess's decision, Buckingham Palace said she had made ``private,
alternative plans'' for the Christmas holiday.
But Prince William and Prince Harry would be joining other members of the royal
family for the Christmas break at Sandringham.
Last month, in the wake of her Panorama interview, the princess indicated that
she would be at Sandringham as usual, a move seen as a gesture of conciliation
to the Queen.
``This change is made at the princess's own request and after discussion with
the Queen,'' the palace said.
``The princess has repeated her gratitude to the Queen for Her Majesty's
invitation to Sandringham.''
Royal sources said that there had been no ``falling out'' and no pressure had
been put on the princess.
The princess had been expected to arrive at Sandringham with her sons on
Christmas Eve.
It is unclear whether the princess's ``alternative plans'' at Christmas involve
a holiday abroad or time devoted to charity work at home.
It is possible that the ``Queen of Hearts'', as she would like to be known,
could spend time with the homeless and other disadvantaged people.
This Christmas was the princess's turn to have her sons for the first two weeks
of their four-week school break, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
It would appear that Prince William and Prince Harry have asked to be at
Sandringham, with their father and other royals, and that the princess agreed.
The princes are due to go on a ski-ing holiday with their father in Klosters,
Switzerland, on New Year's Day.

A JOHN MAJOR Cabinet would almost certainly ask the people in a referendum
before Britain is committed to a European single currency and a central bank in
Frankfurt.
The Prime Minister told the Commons yesterday: ``For a decision of such
magnitude, we shall certainly keep in mind the possibility of a referendum if
the Cabinet were to recommend British entry.''
His reply to his former foreign secretary Douglas Hurd seemed to reassure Tory
Euro-rebels who gave him an easy time when he was reporting on the Madrid
summit at which European leaders endorsed their target date of January 1, 1999,
for monetary union.
Mr Major said that a referendum had been in his mind for at least two years.
``It remains there, and I think it is right to keep that before us for
consideration.''
The implication is that if there is a Tory government in 1998 - a year after
the latest date for a General Election - Mr Major will not seek a referendum if
he keeps Britain out of a single currency.
His statement yesterday could have an effect on the Commons vote tonight on
British fisheries. Some Tory Euro-rebels will abstain and others might even
support the Government against Mr Tony Blair who was shown up by the Prime
Minister in the Commons yesterday as having a party equally divided on
Britain's future in Europe.
An ebullient Mr Major carefully avoided the constitutional issue concerning
British sovereignty in a single currency run by the European central bank from
Frankfurt. The Euro-rebels did not press him too hard on this point. At Madrid,
the Prime Minister covered himself by fighting through a demand for a study on
the effects of a single currency in 1999 or later on what he claimed to be the
majority of member nations who will not be ready economically for it.
Mr Major reported that the European Commission will also have to show the
effects of the single currency on a minority of member nations who might be
ready to join, including Britain.
He told the Commons: ``It is now certain that on a proper interpretation of the
criteria only a small number of member states will meet the criteria if a
single currency is introduced in January 1999.
``Before taking such a step, the European Union needs to examine what it would
mean in practice. It must consider its effect on the states outside the single
currency area as well as those inside it.
``It must consider how decisions would be taken, it must ask whether the result
would be divergence rather than convergence of European economies.''
He had a list of several other difficult questions that he wants answered
before he commits Britain to a single currency or not - the effect on
employment, monetary instability and resource transfers from the EU budget to
member states and their regions.
He won Tory cheers when he promised that there is no question of him committing
Britain to a preparatory Exchange Rate Mechanism.
``This is a course which has already been tried and failed. I have made it
clear to our partners that I would not recommend that sterling should return to
such a system.''
Mr Blair agreed with a large part of Mr Major's conduct at the Madrid summit
but he claimed that, nevertheless, the Prime Minister's European policy was in
``tatters''.
Divisions among the Tories had consigned the Prime Minister to ``perpetual
weakness and indecision''.
This was the Prime Minister's cue to point at divisions in the Labour Party
about this crucial issue on whether or not Britain should commit itself to
economic and monetary union.
The two leaders then rehearsed possible General Election manifestos concerning
a referendum before joining a single currency.
Mr Major would use one only if he wants to join. Yesterday it was still unclear
whether Mr Blair would have a referendum either way. The crucial issue of
sovereignty was hardly touched upon by either side - these are battles to come.
Mr Major said that decisions on economic and monetary union would have a
profound effect on the ``political and economic stability of our continent over
the next generation''. He had gone along with the decision to name such a
single currency the ``Euro''.

<HEADLINE>Rents to rise as Glasgow axes jobs</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GLASGOW'S 112,000 council tenants face the prospect of weekly rents rising by
#3.94 to an average of #37.11 per week.
Along with the rise in rents comes the loss of 317 jobs in departments involved
in the housing service - architects, surveyors, engineers, and housing
administration.
While about 184 of these are expected to be dealt with by voluntary severance,
the remaining staff will face a more uncertain future.
Redeployment and retraining are seen as possible solutions and the leader of
the new shadow City of Glasgow Council, Mr Robert Gould, indicated that
compulsory redundancy was not being considered at this stage.
However, he warned that the situation would be ``ten times worse'' when the
rest of the council budget was being considered.
Amid speculation that between 1500 and 2000 jobs across the full spectrum of
council services could be lost, he said: ``I wouldn't disagree with those
figures. It's a possibility but I don't think things will get to that extent.''
The 12% rent increase, approved by a large majority at a meeting of the shadow
council's Labour group, will be imposed by the existing district council on
March 1. It follows an unprecedented crisis in the housing account, caused,
among other things, by Government cuts in the city's housing capital allocation
(permission to borrow).
Another major factor is the requirement to absorb staff being dispersed due to
the abolition of Strathclyde Regional Council.
On the rents issue, Councillor Gould complained: ``As a council tenant myself,
I appreciate this is a desperate increase but, if we don't do anything, the
housing stock would fall apart.''
He added: ``The blame should be laid at the door of the Scottish Office and the
Conservative Party for what they've done to the housing situation in Glasgow -
cutting the capital allocation and cutting rent subsidy.''

<HEADLINE>EU boost for Scots salmon farmers</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>974815303</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S 5000 salmon farmers were handed a pre-Christmas lifeline by Brussels
yesterday.
The European Commission stepped in to save them from the threat of bankruptcy
caused by cheap imports into the Continent by setting new minimum salmon prices.
Scots fish farmers' normally lucrative pre-Christmas trade to Europe has been
savaged this year by a flood of cheap imports from Norway, where sea farmers
have recently massively boosted their capacity.
The Commission has now set for the next six months the minimum price for the
EU, which cannot be undercut by outside producers.
The industry gives work to 5000 Scots and last year its output was worth more
than #250m, mainly from farms in remoter sea lochs in the Highlands and
Islands, where there are few other job opportunities.
Yesterday's move was welcomed by Mr Bill Crowe, chief executive of the Scottish
Salmon Growers' Association, who said: ``This has come just in the nick of time
to save the Scottish industry. The problem is that Norway's has recently been
selling salmon in Europe at below our costs of production.''
The price fixed yesterday was #2.97 per kilo, as much as 80p above some prices
recently obtained by the Norwegians.
However, Mr Crowe added: ``There is still a massive over-capacity of young
salmon in the waters in Norwegian fish farms, and we are looking for the
Commission to put a ceiling on their exports next year.''
Scottish growers can now confidently expect to get just over #3 a kilo for
their output - enough to give them a reasonable profit margin meantime.

THE losing Labour candidate in the disputed Glasgow Govan parliamentary seat
yesterday withdrew his threat of legal action pending the outcome of a Labour
inquiry into the result.
Councillor Mohammed Sarwar said he had no wish to drag his party through the
courts over the result which, after a count-back, saw his rival MP Mike Watson
take the candidature by one vote.
``If I get a fair hearing, I have no intention of taking legal action,'' said
Councillor Sarwar last night. ``It is not my way of business to take my party
into court and I hope that justice will be done.''
Mr Sarwar, a millionaire businessman with a large cash and carry company in
Glasgow, said he was happy with Labour's procedure for investigation. All
complaints over the selection will be sifted through by officials of the Labour
Party at its Walworth Road headquarters in London during the coming weeks
before a decision is taken on whether to start an investigation.
A spokesman for Labour's national organiser, Mr Peter Coleman, yesterday
scotched reports that a probe was already under way, saying: ``There is no
inquiry being carried out by the national executive committee at the moment. It
is just not true.
``The officers of the party will look into any complaints made and report, with
a recommendation, at the end of January. That recommendaton will either say
that Mike Watson should be accepted as the prospective candidate for Govan or
it will say that there is a problem and something needs to be done about it.
Only then would an NEC inquiry take place.''
The row over the Glasgow Govan seat erupted last week when it was revealed that
52 ballot papers had been rejected by the scrutineers because of doubts over
authenticity.
It brought immediate claims of racism by supporters of Mr Sarwar and the
dispute was escalated when Hillhead MP George Galloway denounced the result at
a meeting in Yorkshire on Friday.
Mr Sarwar added yesterday that all he wanted was a re-examination of the
ballot: ``With a result as close as this, with 52 postal ballots rejected on
the basis of signatures, I would like it looked into. There was no handwriting
expert there to judge.
``Either these members' signatures should be re-scrutinised and if any are
clearly false they should be rejected, or there should be a re-ballot or the
contest should be re-run. There is no fourth option.''

A SCHOOL runaway needed hospital treatment after she was fed drugs by an older
teenager, a court heard yesterday.
The 13-year-old girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found lying on
a grass verge near Aberdeen beach.
The city's sheriff court was told she had smoked cannabis and swallowed 11
Temazepam tablets given to her by Colin Roy.
Roy, 17, of Forbeshill, Forres, admitted supplying the girl with the drugs in
August of this year.
He also admitted possessing 1.35 grammes of cannabis resin which police found
in his bedroom.
Depute-fiscal Fiona Murray told the court that the 13-year-old, along with
another girl aged 14, had gone absent from an Aberdeen school on August 5.
They met Roy in the city's Rosemount area that afternoon and he handed over the
drugs.
``During the following two hours, the three of them wandered around Aberdeen
and the 13-year-old smoked the cannabis and swallowed all the tablets. This
made her extremely intoxicated,'' said Miss Murray.
She said Roy and the 14-year-old abandoned the younger girl, who was later
found by a teacher from the school.
``She was lying on the grass verge on Beach Boulevard. She was taken back to
the school, where she told staff that she had been given the drugs and was
taken to hospital.''
Miss Murray said Roy was traced and cannabis resin found in his bedroom. He
confessed to having given the girl the drugs, she said.
Sheriff Alexander Jessop deferred sentence on Roy until January 15 for
background reports.

LABOUR and Liberal Democrat leaders have agreed a joint strategy for today's
debate in the Commons on the constitutional changes proposed by Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth: they will accept them unopposed.
MPs will debate the changes to the standing orders of the Scottish Grand
Committee introduced by Mr Forsyth, which will allow the committee to take
questions and scrutinise uncontested legislation further.
Labour or the Liberal Democrats could have tabled amendments opposing the
reforms.
However, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said last night: ``Our
joint view is very much that we do not dignify these so-called reforms with
that sort of attention.
``We are not going to vote on what is a tenth-rate substitute for a Scottish
parliament. After having agreed it got it wrong on devolution, the Government
has simply come up with window-dressing.''
THE Labour MP for Glasgow Provan, Mr Jimmy Wray, last night was selected as the
party's parliamentary candidate to fight the new seat of Glasgow Baillieston at
the next General Election. His selection follows boundary changes which have
reduced the number of city seats from 11 to 10.
THE Government moved last night to harmonise Britain's copyright laws with
those in the rest of Europe. New rules are expected to net music publishers and
the estates of leading modern writers millions of pounds in extra royalties.
They will bring Britain into line with France and Germany by extending
copyright protection from 50 years to 70 years. The Government also disclosed
that authors will continue to receive 2p each time their books are borrowed
from a public library after the Public Lending Right Scheme is renewed in
February.
THE Prime Minister said yesterday he hoped to boost trade links with Ukraine
which would be ``an important part of the European scene for the future''. He
was giving details of talks in London with Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma.

n.Interesting reading in the New Woman Beauty Awards handbook, produced to
accompany the magazine's annual search f
n.A note of thanks to Bill Craig of Stirling, who has sent in a Reader's Digest
article with the distressing finding that marital rows are harder on men than
women, playing merry hell with a chap's internal organs, blood pressure, heart
rate etc etc. Could we look into this, he asks, and preferably without feminist
bias, because ``a feminist would begin by having a laugh at the idea that `poor
dumb men' may have more sensitive nervous systems than women''. As if, Bill, as
if.
n.Child rearing as a political statement in January's Tatler, where celebrity
fathers share a moment of the quality time they spend with their sons and
daughters. It is a useful lesson in how dirty a word materialism becomes once
you have it in spades; contrast the farmyard family vision of actor Trevor Eve
(``This year we brought the hay in on an old tractor. I may be a blind romantic
but I feel that's a better kind of childhood than cruising around the shopping
mall in packs'') with that of defector ballet star Irek Mukhamedov, whose
daughter Sasha has 10 Barbie dolls: ``Her childhood is so different from mine
but hers is better ..... When I was a child, there was pressure; it was `all
for your country'. Sasha is more free, it's all for her.''
n.East meets West, the lonely hearts column in the new bilingual Anglo-Japanese
magazine Duo reveals the true stuff of a nation; we have the purely physical
side (``Mr good looking, 32, white male seeks Miss good looking, very
attractive, pretty, Japanese speaking woman''), the stability of a profession
(``Japanese speaking man, salary man, good position seeks Japanese speaking
woman''), to the precision of a woman who knows what she wants (``Extraordinary
single white female, 30, seeks intelligent, honest, funny Japanese speaking man
for total devotion for the next 20 years'').
Interestingly, the Duo Soul Mates Policy states ``No advert of Pacific sexual
nature is acceptable'' although it certainly sounds intriguing, and you can't
write in looking for children or an affair. Oh, and adverts which discriminate
on race, creed or colour are also out. Single white female is obviously a
meaningless turn of phrase, then, unlike Duo's helpful guide to Cockney rhyming
slang; Beecham's pill, understandably, is very ill, and custard and jerry, one
sees immediately, is telly, although the jam tart: girlfriend entry has me
stumped.

As creatures, minks stink - but, as far as Marcella Evaristi is concerned, once
they're all made up into a fur coat they're like poetry in motion
SKINS
The hemp shop, has opened wide
as a dilated pupil
On the Great Western Road.
Three cream shirts are hanging out
in the window,
Confident as any joint in Amsterdam,
And innocent as a fifties Daz ad.
Someone should tell them, honey-
Coloureds, this aint Holland,
Nearest tulips is Roots and Fruits  and Flowers and -
Try to concentrate - You are situ  ated halfway
Between Solly's the fruit shop, and  Glasgow Academy,
And your big centrepiece hardback  book
Strumming the praises of cannabis  and its world-saving properties
Could be lift'd at any moment,
Like one of Solly's melons.
(You may get more than detention).
Stamping that leaf motif everywhere
May have been a giggle at the time,
And aesthetically pleasing enough -
The serene green, the quasi-Christ  mas tree shape,
But you can't muscle in on the sea  sonal scene
So easy - Think you could cut it   up fairly?
``Hey, Park Road Pharmacy,
We won't butt in on your bubble-  bath sales
If you don't sell-dope-on-a-rope.
Is that a deal?''
Get real, I don't want to be rude,  but if you read the papers
Instead of rolling them, you might  have been caught Clare Short,
You might have Steeled yourself,  you might like an advocate's wife
Have realised you will not be given   the benefit of the doubt,
Much less the roach
STRANGE really, that a shop called ``Skins'' with its rows of not-woolly hats
and sweaters and waistcoats, dedicated to the environmental case for
hemp-growing (which could be used for paper production and solve the
rain-forest problem and save us all from Sting singing about it) could be
mistaken for a fur shop by a friend of mine. His excuse was that he was driving
past and is not such an expert as I am at clocking shop-window contents at
whatever speed they may whiz from my assessment. ``Skins, as in Rizla papers,''
I said. ``For making `J's.'' ``Ah,'' he said. He relies on me to explain such
things to him, as I rely on him to give me tips on being a grown-up.
(Like opening unfriendly brown envelopes the day they arrive, instead of
slipping them between The Restoration Court Stage and Les Enfants Terribles on
my bookshelf. Like getting a spare set of keys cut, instead of organising a
standing order from the locksmith. Like suggesting that to bad-mouth my bank
manager by Christian name in The Herald is not, if I want an overdraft of more
than 50p, ultimately worth the unheard giggles of strangers.)
Anyway, I got to wondering what a fur shop, were anyone masochistic enough to
open one, could call itself, when a cannabis boutique - all right a hemp
parlour - has appropriated ``Skins''. Obviously, one would have to be discreet.
So people could go there to score a stole, without the vegan constabulary
raiding the Dulux counters on their way to arresting you with emulsion. ``I
swear I thought it was a fun fur, Officer Not.'' (Fun fur is such a dumb-animal
name for synthetic crap. Like calling Bri-Nylon ``fun silk''. Save the worms.)
``His 'n' Hirsutes''? No, too convoluted. ``Foxy lady''? Too literal. Ah,
what's the point, the sign would be glossed over before the paint had time to
dry. Might as well call it ``Come and get me'' then give up and go underground.
I do believe it's immoral to wear endangered species but I really can't get
worked up about mink, apart from when it's beautifully cut and on my back. All
this is academic of course, since I can't afford one, so please make any paint
attacks similarly hypothetical please. But morally there is no difference
between wearing leather and unendangered hair, is there? A mink is the
Manhattan of the rat world, and it's no surprise really that people who can
afford it discard the verminous part and make warm whoopee with the glorious
fur. If it were cheap pigskin, it would not cause such disgust.
A famous and effective anti-fur trade poster showed a haute couture world,
where models on the catwalk trailed their furs behind them - and the furs
trailed blood. A woman wearing leather trousers which dribbled gore around her
ankles would not have had the same effect. The juxtaposition of affluence and
victim-innocence is the real issue - so the slaughter of cows is not as emotive
as the slaughter of long-haired rats, not because of our attitude towards the
animals concerned but because of our attitude towards economic inequality.
The association attached to the mink coat is perfect for moral objection, but
the objection is muddled. From a seventies perspective this ungroovy garment
said ``I'm a frumpy bourgeoise and my husband's rich'' or ``I'm a misguided
status merchant; I actually saved up for this Beryl Cook bunny jacket''.
And the student who would have killed for that black calfskin maxi-coat laughed
at her auntie who wore a dead fox around her neck, its sharp little teeth
biting its own tail beneath auntie's double chin. The Brecht capitalist with
fat cigar and top hat was ideally partnered by fat wife in fur. Not decadent,
which can be sexy, but naff. Cowboy boots were leftist, and affordable - mink
was your straight cousin who gave up her MA for a MAN, mink was uncool as a
twinset, mink didn't slip to the floor until the solitaire was on the
unliberated finger.
But in Florence one winter I saw beautiful young women in long chic glistening
coats, with fitted waists and wide collars raised against the January frost,
laughing beside the chestnut braziers, and I suddenly understood. Afghan coats
then became the Beryl Cooks. I looked and lusted, and later tried one on. Oh
my, it was Manhattan, Milano, and Zhivago, it was the tactile equivalent of
mellifluousness, it was pure fantasy and deep authentic fun. There, I've just
fur-outed myself. Pelt me if you must.
I do, though, wish ``Skins'' all the best, and not just for the copy, although
having read the above, they might not want to encourage my sort in their
establishment:
``We must ask you to leave quietly, Ms.''
``What do you mean `quietly'? I'm Italian.''
``Exactly, so perhaps the restaurant nearby would be more appropriate. I
believe they serve veal there.''
``I want a hash hat. I was going to buy that whacky basket.''
``The management reserves the civil right to . . .
``All right, I'm going. Tofu to you too . . .''
But hold it there, paranoia. Just because I have admitted to being a secret
minker does not mean that intolerance awaits me. Here, of all places, paranoia
will be understood. For while marijuana has never caused a death, and could
save the planet, it can, I am told, induce feelings of being heavily got at.
(What do you mean, who told me? What exactly do you mean by that?)
So I shall hold on to the fact that it's a pleasant, light, and welcoming
place, where I actually learnt something I didn't know, what with crop
statistics and all. And it's not often I am educated while I shop, I mean,
Princes Square is not exactly a late-opening early-learning centre, unless you
count the bitter experience of not being able to afford things.
But then I never learn by experience, I only write about it, which I find more
lucrative than self-knowledge. No, I welcome this new shop on the block, for it
is always stressful waiting to find out what's going to replace the familiar.
That dreary Christian Science Third Church Reading Room where the good
chippie's vinegary smells used once to delight. The old-fashioned cobbler's
becoming a Burger King.
Perhaps I shall become a regular customer, and make a non-addictive habit of
dropping in to see what ingenious new hemp-uses have been discovered. A hemp
ladder maybe. Once at the top you'd have to guess why you wanted up there. I
know, now, I'm confusing the rope and the resin, the fibre, and the hash. The
proprietors would hardly dabble in the actual-illegal, not with that great big
wall painting of the plant staring the clientele in the face, not with that
upfront shop front. They obviously know their parameters and have nothing
crumbly in clingfilm to hide.
Still, how I would have loved to have listened in to their co-operative
discussion as to what to call their shop. What was the competition that
``Skins'' won? Did someone mention ``Munchies''? Did the majority groan at
``Blaw and Q''? How did they get a bank loan; and can I have the name of their
bank manager if I swear I will never use it in print? I think ``Memory GAP''
would have been neat, but forbidden by copyright I suppose. And too flippant by
far.
Still everyone I know smiles and shakes their head disbelievingly when they
pass the joint, which shows how commendable the venture is - giving pleasure
even to the non-paying non-customer. May the eccentric always flourish amid the
clone stores, and never go - or get - bust.

SPORT in St Andrews is getting a massive injection of lottery cash.
More than #600,000 of lottery sports fund cash will be spent on a new complex
at the town's university.
A floodlit, multi-purpose pitch, four tennis courts, an athletics track,
cricket nets, and changing accommodation will be built at the university but
the facilities will be open to local people and sports organisations.
The windfall is the biggest in the latest round of awards from the Scottish
Sports Council through the Lottery Sports Fund.
Yesterday's announcement of 14 awards, totalling #833,225, comes less than a
fortnight after the council revealed a #6.11m boost to 30 projects throughout
Scotland.

<HEADLINE>Council will give #900,000 for stadium</HEADLINE>

INVERNESS District Council last night narrowly voted to grant #900,000 towards
Caledonian Thistle FC's new stadium on the outskirts of the Highland capital,
thereby preserving the club's membership of the Scottish League and saving up
to #9m worth of development.
After two hours of debate, councillors approved the grant by 14 votes to 12,
subject to European Objective One funding, despite advice from chief executive
Allan Imlah that it would almost certainly leave the council in deficit before
it handed over to the new Highland Council on April 1 and might even leave them
open to surcharge. The money is to be raised by selling council assets.
However, Councillor David Stewart, who moved the successful motion, said: ``I
think talk of surcharge is very much the big bad wolf out in the forest. There
have been very few cases of councillors in Scotland being surcharged unless
they have gone against a specific law. This is an idea whose time has come.
Rather than asking why we are doing it, ask why not?''
The chairman of Caley Thistle, Mr Doug McGilvray, said after: ``I am absolutely
delighted. We can now go ahead. I will call a board meeting tomorrow night so
we can ratify placing the contracts and start building the stadium.''
The vote had been crucial to the club, whose name will change for next season
to include Inverness, as failure to make the grant would have meant that the
funding package for the #5.2m stadium at East Longman at the southern end of
the Kessock Bridge would have fallen apart.
Local enterprise company Inverness and Nairn Enterprise's grant of #655,000
towards a road to the stadium would have been withdrawn.
The stadium would not have been built in time to meet the Scottish League's
already extended deadline of August and failure to deliver it in time for next
season would have meant exclusion from the league.
In addition, Inverness Harbour Trust's extensive development programme at
Longman was dependent on the stadium's approach road. Between that, the stadium
itself, and the spin-off developments at Inverness Caledonian's ground, Telford
Street, and Inverness Thistle's ground at Kingsmills, developments totalling
#9m, creating 200 construction and 130 permanent jobs, were riding on last
night's vote.
The council's special meeting followed nearly four months of deferrals since
the council originally voted by 14 votes to 11 to make the grant.

A TORY MP yesterday questioned whether television taste and decency rules are
adequate, telling the Commons one recent film contained 212 ``uses of the
F-word''
Mr Michael Stephen (Shoreham) said at Question Time: ``Many MPs on both sides
are very concerned that digital broadcasters would have to observe the highest
standards of taste and decency.''
He asked National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley: ``If the existing
codes of conduct are adequate, can you explain why, in April and again in June
this year, it was possible to screen a film called Goodfellas which included
stabbings, shootings and, in its 146 minutes, contained 212 uses of the F-word
and on four occasions the F-word used in conjunction with the word `mother?'''
Mrs Bottomley said: ``The introduction of the Broadcasting Standards Council,
combining the strengths of the two predecessor bodies, is intended to ensure
that  there is an enhanced sense of responsibility to the interests of
audiences and the public.'' She added that programme-makers would have to
provide evidence that they were taking steps in response to viewers' complaints.

TENANTS' associations overwhelmingly rejected Government proposals to introduce
probationary tenancies as a remedy to the problem of anti-social tenants when
they gave evidence yesterday to the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee in
Glasgow.
Mr John Wilson, director of the Glasgow Council of Tenants' Associations,
warned that such a move would stigmatise ``probationary'' tenants and would
discourage people from wanting to invest in their homes during the proposed
one-year probation.
Mrs Alice Bovill, treasurer of Dundee Federation of Tenants Associations,
warned: ``It discriminates against tenants as opposed to owner-occupiers and
some residents are going to use such a scheme against people they do not like.''
Earlier this year, the Scottish Office introduced a White Paper proposing that
all new tenants taking up a council tenancy would no longer have an immediate
right to a secure tenancy and would have to serve a 12-month probationary
period.
Tenants' representatives from Dundee and Glasgow also rejected eviction as a
means of dealing with tenants who posed a persistent nuisance and made their
neighbours' lives miserable.
Mr Alex Paton, secretary of Glasgow Council of Tenants' Associations, said:
``We should not be going for eviction, but looking for a cure - education for
everybody.''
Mrs Frances Nelson, chairperson of the Dundee Federation of Tenants'
Associations, added: ``Eviction should be a last resort. A change of behaviour
is what we really need to be looking at.''
However, Mr George McKie, convener of the Edinburgh Tenants' Federation, said:
``Certainly, people who are guilty of serious anti-social behaviour, people who
cause their neighbours or near neighbours to live in fear, who totally disrupt
the lives of those living around them, are guilty of socially intolerable
behaviour and should be evicted from their present homes. What you do with them
I do not know.
``We are opposed to creating ghettos of any kind. It has been tried and failed.
Everyone there becomes unemployable and the children who grow up there have no
chance of a reasonable education or a job when they grow up.''
Chairman of the Scottish Affairs Committee, Mr Willie McKelvey, Labour MP for
Kilmarnock and Loudoun, said the hearings had been called because MPs had
become aware of a growing problem of anti-social behaviour towards neighbours.
Asked for proposals to improve the current methods for dealing with such
problems, Mrs Nelson said she favoured the setting up of housing courts, or
tribunals - with lay people serving on them - that could deal with cases faster
than the current court process and would be less intimidating for witnesses.
All the tenants' representatives called for more resources to be made available
for tackling social problems and also for improving the quality of housing
stock. Poor sound-proofing and thin walls often contributed to the problem of
noise, recognised as the most common irritant, particularly in times when more
people had television sets and music equipment.

THREE new-age travellers who were the first people to face prosecution under
the Criminal Justice Act in Scotland will stand trial again in January despite
being acquitted last spring.
Mr Paul Rhodes, 31, Mr Gary Frost, 31, and Ms Marie Ann Nicol, 22, now living
at Dundreggan in Glen Moriston, are set to reappear at Fort William Sheriff
Court on January 24.
In April, they were found not guilty of being part of a group illegally
encamped at Dengin near Invergarry. Sheriff Frederick Levine had ruled that
ownership of the land could not be established.
In October, three Court of Session judges upheld an appeal by Fort William
procurator-fiscal Agnes Neizer, who had challenged the acquittal verdict.

COMMUNISTS emerged yesterday as the big winners in Russia's parliamentary
election ahead of nationalists and the pro-Government party, causing ripples of
concern but no shockwaves abroad.
Cashing in on discontent with hardships under market reforms, the Communist
Party led with 21.9% of votes, although not even half the ballots from Sunday's
election to the State Duma (lower house) had been counted by yesterday evening.
Ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR),
defying its critics, was on 11.1%. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's
centre-right Our Home Is Russia bloc was third with 9.6% as the results
trickled in.
``This is a complete rejection of the old radical system. The system has
collapsed and become bankrupt,'' said Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
``In fact, the Government has received a vote of no confidence,'' he added,
demanding changes in the Cabinet.
The vote was a slap in the face for President Boris Yeltsin and his reforms,
which have made a few Russians rich but made life no better for most of the
population of nearly 150 million.
But the number of Yeltsin's opponents is unlikely to grow in the Duma. Although
the communists are doing well, extreme nationalists look set to have fewer
seats than in the old Duma.
A calm reaction abroad reflected the belief that there can be no return to the
hardline past which died in 1991 with the Soviet Union and more than 70 years
of one-party rule.
Financial markets were unruffled. Investors said real power lies with the
presidency under Russia's constitution, limiting the communists' ability to
force immediate changes of policy.
Yeltsin made no public comment.

of the arts, with the Scottish galleries left to suffer from a lack of buying
power
AT A stroke Michael Forsyth has just given #32,550,000 to the Museum of
Scotland and slashed the purchasing power of the National Galleries of Scotland
by half. This is on top of an April cut of #500,000, reducing the total of the
NGS purchase budget by two thirds.
So is this a slap in the face for the Galleries or the first sign of what
everyone dreads: one step on the slippery slope of lottery money being expected
to act as a substitute to Government funding? And why is one Scottish national
institution being favoured at the expense of another?
While the Museum of Scotland revels in its Christmas bonanza, NGS Director,
Timothy Clifford, is seething. Scrooge has suddenly slid down his chimney.
After a lively season with star acquisitions like the Three Graces and
Penrose's Surrealist Collection attracting record crowds (``We had 10,000
visitors one day, the previous high was 3000.''), he wonders if the NGS is
being penalised for its success or punished for its audacity in expanding to
Glasgow.
Angus Grossart, chairman of the NGS board, shares Clifford's wrath. ``I have
difficulty in understanding the rationale. It's ironic, especially when we are
so successful in securing objects of outstanding, international quality which
put the gallery on the map. Clifford has been astute in his use of the purchase
grant as leverage for additional funds.
``The Lottery gave 75% of the total towards the #4m Penrose pictures; The Three
Graces cost #7.6m, but NGS contributed a mere #1.2m. We show conspicuous form,
are highly visible and efffective, and punch our weight better than any gallery
in the UK. We refuse to be relegated to some regional perspective.''
Interestingly, cuts haven't happened in the south. The reality of the Scottish
Office decision may lie some way between muddled thinking, unrealistic hopes of
the lottery, and favouritism towards the less rumbustious Royal Museums of
Scotland - whose offspring, the new Museum of Scotland, is nevertheless quietly
soaking up huge amounts as costs escalate from #30m to a current figure of
#47.05m (including #14.5m fitting out costs).
The disproportionate imbalance towards the Museum of Scotland is underlined by
its grant-in-aid figures for the current financial year rising to almost #20m
with running costs rising from #11.007m in 1994/5 to #11.126m for 1995/6. This
is a lot in anyone's book. Meanwhile, its purchase grant has also been cut from
#717,000 in 94, to #482,000 in 1995-6 and #210,000 for 1996-7. As ever, it
seems bricks and mortar are seen as more important than the art works the
buildings contain. Moreover, first come first served is the begging bowl rule.
One factor is significant. The Museum of Scotland is committed to finding all
the #14.5m fitting-out costs. So far, the Lottery pays for 50%, and #5.3m has
been fundraised, leaving a gap of #2m to be found before opening in December
1998. The net increase to running cost of the new museum, say the Scottish
Office, is currently estimated at #800,000. ``The Government will consider the
funding provision for this in a future Public Expenditure round.''
Clifford believes his purchase grant cuts are ``a stupid, copycat ministerial
decision''.
He says: ``The Scottish Office has used no intellect or initiative, just copied
London's thinking and philosophy with no thought to the Scottish dimension.
London has different rules and advantages. Forsyth has given priority to
conserving buildings and paintings, not because it's necessary but because
that's the way England's Department of National Heritage are playing it. Our
buildings are spic and span and our pictures in an excellent state of
conservation with no backlog. But we do need to catch up on our buying.''
The dire reality is that, as Duncan Thomson, keeper of the Portrait Gallery
puts it, ``We can no longer pursue our job''. He says: ``It's a statutory
obligation of the NGS, enshrined in the 1985 Heritage Act which incorportates
our 1906 statute, to buy; to add to the collection. And The Portrait Gallery's
case is special. You can buy a Rubens' sketch any time. We waited 50 years for
a portrait of Eric Liddle to come up. It cost only #8000 but it's the sole one
on earth. If we miss it, that's it. Scottish heritage pictures are unique.
Commissioning portraits before famous people die is another instance. Folk
don't live for ever.''
And as Tim Mason, director of the Museums &amp; Galleries Commission points out:
``The Lottery moves too slowly for pictures that come up at auction. In fact,
overall, the lottery has not so far come up with much for acquisitions. Tim
Clifford has done better than most.''
Clifford has proved that buying big pays. The Three Graces brought in ten times
the audience of previous Festival shows. Moreover it pays to spend. ``Once you
have money on the table, other funds roll in, sometimes a tenfold bonus. Last
year Henry Moore's #300,000 Helmet only cost us #35,000, while our new
Procaccini Madonna brought in half the #600,000 cost from the Lottery.''
If you add up the money Clifford has attracted to Scotland, (prising it out of
the hands of the Lottery, the metropolis and others including Getty), it's
obvious that by cutting #1.3m off the seed funding, the Scottish Office is
actually depriving Scotland of another three or four million pounds which will
now go south. This is irresponsible.
The Lottery has changed the face of gallery and museum funding, but although
the original 50/50 rule has been relaxed as the lottery millions roll in,
galleries still have to put at least 25% on the table first. ``We still owe
#100,000 on the Porcaccini, plus the last tranche of #550,000 for Penrose. The
Scottish Office knew our commitment, so knowingly cut us to zilch.''
Clifford was geared up for three  aquisitions ``of immense importance, with key
Scottish connections''. What now? ``Heaven knows! With nothing in the bank,
it's hopeless. Without new aquisitions any gallery, however good, atrophies.
Take the Wallace Collection. It is full of lovely things but no-one goes
there.''
To make matters worse, whereas English galleries now get their cash in a block,
allowing  boards to choose their own priorities, Clifford's hands are tied.
Scotland allocates its housekeeping in itemised amounts. The annual running
costs and capital expenditure, (currently #6.5m) cannot be dipped into. In
London, the Tate or National Gallery can decide for themselves how to allocate
their money. Again Scotland is penalised.
The knock on effect of these cuts is a slap in the face for Glasgow too. The
National Galleries recently secured a home in the old Post Office building in
George Square. So we also can wave goodbye to any acquisitions or commissions
with a west coast flavour, be they historical or contemporary - or indeed any
major new international item that would have brought the tourist crowds to
Glasgow as The Three Graces do for Edinburgh.
Contemporary Scottish artists will shrug and ask: ``What's new?'' The NGS never
showed any interest anyway, and, says keeper Richard Calvocoressi: ``The SAC
Lottery people won't look at funding anything for our modern permanent
collection.''
But in fact Clifford was all set to go on a Glasgow studio tour and buying
spree conducted by yours truly. No hope now, other than a morale boosting recce.
In the past, Scotland's separate system of funding, with Clifford's manifest
ability to cajole cash out of the tightest of pockets, meant that while
London's Tate and National Gallery budgets were frozen since 1985, Scotland's
figures gradually crept up. Clifford's argument is that not only does the NGS
do the work of fie English galleries: National, Portrait Gallery, V &amp; A, Tate
and Bradford, (whose total fire power for buying comes to well over #10
million), it needs more money because Scotland lags behind.
``London is awash with quality stuff. People in Scotland should have the
opportunity to see at least one good example of top quality Stubbs, Raphael or
Fragonard etc and not have to trot down to London. That seems fair.''
Experts do wonder if, just as the poll tax was tried out north of the border,
is this a trial run for the Lottery to take over the Government's
responsibilities? Are the Treasury's sticky fingers on the warpath, as William
Waldgrave's leaked memo about the Department of National Heritage earlier this
year might have us believe?
Meanwhile, the National Audit Office Report on Scotland's National Museums and
Galleries published last week finds ``both institutions provide high standards
of service, although scope exists to improve some exhibitions and their
management''. The Report praises NGS increased visitor figures, criticises
labelling and lack of temporary exhibition space. The National Museums shows
only five per cent of its collections - this is expected to rise to eight per
cent when the new Museum of Scotland is open. ``Great care is taken with the
content and themes of their exhibitions . . . they have consulted widely.'' In
the four years to March 94 the direct cost of National Museums' exhibition
development, including the Museum of Scotland, totalled #10m.
One hopes this battle for cash between Scotland's two giants in the art world
will rectify the Report's main and valid criticism, that they should both get
off their elitist high horse and ``encourage the widest range of users . . .
including less-informed visitors.''

He took on the trade unions, now he's taking on the world. Margaret Vaughan
listens in amazement as Andrew Neil puts the accent on going global
WHAT is it about Andrew Neil that makes him such a satisfactory target for
cruelty? You know the kind of thing. Every time he crops up, as he does,
frequently, in the papers, on telly, in the gossip columns, there's this
tendency to slag him off just because ..... just because, well, look it's
really hard to explain. So let's start at the beginning.
You want to interview Mr Neil about his new programme which begins on BBC2 next
month. While you're at it, you think, you'll ask him why he thinks people so
revel in scoffing at everything from his grizzled hairstyle, to his proclivity
for bopping around nightclubs aged 46, to his string of shapely companions.
Then there's the long running send-up in a satirical magazine involving a snap
of him, rather unwisely perhaps, draped in the kind of vest more usually worn
by men with beer cans welded to their fists in Lloret De Mar, wearing a
baseball cap and an exotic babe on his arm. And there are those now who scoff
at his skills as a columnist, rejoicing in his perceived slither from serious
journalist to sofa chat show celebrity.
Maybe it's a bit unfair, you think, because like it or not, whether you think
he destroyed a newspaper with a fine tradition or jazzed up a dreary paper that
had grown foosty, he was a memorable editor of the Sunday Times. His previous
track record in print journalism was sound enough, culminating in a decade and
more with The Economist.
He was one of those vague faces you saw on telly, a political pundit on various
current affairs shows. Scotland, first, from Glasgow University, then down
South.
After the crushing of the print unions, he emerged flapping his right-wings -
meritocratic on one hand, ultra free market on the other - as Rupert Murdoch's
choice to edit the post-Wapping Sunday Times. His fiercely combative style made
him a familiar face in its heyday.
If Kelvin McKenzie former editor of the Sun was the East End vulgarian, Andrew
Neil was the Scots rude boy in red braces whose jaw jutted in relish at the
chance to blow a raspberry in the bleary eye of the Establishment.
And, you think, so what if in the end Rupert Murdoch scorned him, let go the
leash and left him looking like a skelped puppy without the promised bone of a
prime-time US chat show. He may have been shafted but he left wagging his tail
with a reputed multi-million slipper in his mouth.
And anyway, you nod vigorously to yourself, isn't there something insufferably
smug about those pretentious, parochial, Establishment types who're always
sneering at him. Those like Peregrine Worsthorne and Charles Moore, toffs with
a high regard for themselves who call him ghastly and laugh at him with all the
unselfconscious snobbery of the self-appointed metropolitan elite. True Neil is
more glitterati than literati, but he's from Paisley so he can't be all bad
really.
You begin, almost, to warm to him before you've even spoken. So you ask a BBC
researcher for his phone number. She asks which one you mean. France, New York
or London? You ring. The answering machine relays the information that Andrew
Neil is not available right now and encourages you to leave a message ``after
the high moral tone''. Oh, oh. Now let's not be too hasty.
You call back and he answers on the second ring in a kind of synthetic twangy
accent that is hard to place: somewhere between Paisley drawl meets
mid-Manhattan hipster. You are stern with yourself: you are not going to judge
this man on his accent, even if it is strangulated, because he does after all
spend quite a bit of time in the States, if not quite as much as he would wish.
Maybe he's just got an ear for accents.
Nope, he can't fit in an interview this week and he's off to the States for
Christmas come the weekend. So you wheedle a bit, as one does, and say even a
short time on the telephone would do, and he chuckles a bit and, yup, promises
to call you back which he doesn't. So you speak to his answering machine again
in a tone of high moral indignation ..... You promised Mr Neil.
So he slots you in late afternoon Thursday for a half hour, from the offices of
his new BBC show. And a strange thing happens in the course of a 40 minute
conversation. The curious accent vanishes. Just like that. He begins to sound
like a real person.
But after a while there's another problem. You start to realise why it is that
people poke fun at him. It is because he sets himself up for it. Mr Neil is a
very easy man to mock. Which is why, probably, you should not do it but, oh my,
the temptation......
Take his explanation of his new show. It will be the BBC's answer to Larry King
Live, a US-style chat show with a mixture of international stars and newsmakers
of the day, interviewed by him, then by viewers who can phone in, or use E-mail
or the Internet.
After 15 minutes of the newsmakers of the day the show, at 2.25 will go global
on the BBC's World Television Service. Then it will be the turn of an
international celebrity who will be grilled by Neil and then thrown open to
viewers from around the world in 111 countries, inviting calls from the Indian
sub-continent to the Far East.
You may be relieved to know that Labour and the Tories will not be allowed to
tear lumps off each other on Neil's show, nope, none of that dreary old party
political stuff. Instead? ``Well I think we would have done the Brixton riots
and gone live to one of the community leaders down there. I think the little
girl who died of Ecstasy, that's a story. Or the headmaster who was stabbed,
that was a subject for the pilot.''
Globally, a word he uses a lot, he plans to go right across the spectrum with
major international figures and stories and, um, celebrities. Such as? Meg
Ryan. Or big sports celebrities. Maybe Naomi Campbell. Or Meg Ryan. You get the
impression that he rather likes Meg Ryan.
``One of the great strengths of the Larry King show is he is able to interview
anybody from some rock star to Clinton. British television has been more
segmented. Like Newsnight.''
Not that there's anything wrong with Newsnight, he hastens to assure, as a
regular contributor he very much likes it, but he sees himself doing a show
more like, well more like, the Sunday Times really. With the format he evolved
of a lighter Style Section right through to the heavy News Review.
The show has a 13-week run, going out Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Then the
BBC will have to decide what to do with it: ``We had them down for the pilot
and there was a huge amount of optimism, you know what it's like.''
What you mean very wonderful darling. Yes, darling, that sort of thing he
chuckles. It's a tense chuckle. Look, no doubt about it, it's a new concept for
British broadcasting. But it's a funny time to go out, isn't it 10 past two in
the afternoon? Competing with Home and Away, old reruns of Lassie and going out
after Understanding Cats? When the opinion formers, having dispensed with lunch
some years back, are heavily into budget meeting, cost-control sessions and
thrashing out the latest peace plan for wherever:
``Oh but it was my suggestion the show should go out at that time.'' Ah. You
see, it may only be 10 past two in the UK, but it happens to be the perfect
time to play to the strengths of the BBC World Service globally. Huge audiences
in the Indian sub-continent where it will be nine in the morning, and in the
Far East where it will be 9 o'clock at night. But not the States, alas, not
yet. But they are working on it.
Right, we've done the plug. Now then, what about all these enemies? Yeh,
sometimes it gets exhausting and gruelling, because it gets personal. Mr Neil
sounds a bit weary all of a sudden: ``There is this very incestuous group.
There is a laziness about the elite down here. They don't mind outsiders
provided they're prepared to join them which I'm not. The thing that's kept the
class system going in this country is that it has absorbed new people coming
up.''
Except for him, but that's because he doesn't want to join the elite. They find
him hard to take because he doesn't want to get in there with them. He defines
himself, proudly, as an outsider. The bravado just for a moment sounds a bit
shaky:
``It's out of hand now. All these Oxbridge public school snobs. Look, I have
friends who are of that ..... two of my closest friends were at Eton and Harrow.
``I just don't like the kind of attitude which it seems to me belongs to the
past. I am very international in my outlook. I'm an international player.''
The problem with this analysis is simple. If you define yourself purely by who
your enemies are, it's a negative kind of identity. There's a sense that the
element of self-invention is purely in opposition to others. Which is a bit sad.
If he sounds glib, and he does often, maybe to be fair it's because he's
replying to questions he has answered many times before. So we move on to his
politics. But somehow we keep coming back to the class system. He believes
himself to be a radical, in your face, meritocratic free marketeer, libertarian
on social issues, etc, etc. But his analysis of the class system and its clamp
on the country would do justice to a lifelong member of the Socialist Workers
Party.
They are everywhere, screwing things up, these old class despots. He tells us,
again, that he rather likes being an outsider, a sort of aching tooth in the
loud mouth of upper-class spivs, people he calls toffish bovver boys.
He definitely doesn't want to be one of them, and he can't stand Old Labour
either, and Scotland is so Old Labour. If we want Scottish devolution, we
should have it but why on earth do we want more government not less?
He's a bit out of touch with politics in Scotland now, it's a long time since
he was here. He rather likes Michael Forsyth but has little problem with Tony
Blair, because maybe he's a radical too but he's not sure.
But we've overrun. Time to get on with the life of a globe-trotting celebrity.
Trundling round the world, from one home in Grasse, France, where he's writing
a book, to an apartment in New York to write for Vanity Fair and do various
television projects, back to London to rehearse his new show and write his
newspapers columns......
He seems like a restless person you venture: ha, ha, attention span of a gnat,
he says. All of a sudden you don't want to make fun of him any more. He is a
celebrity now and, em, that's it really.

THE Collective Gallery, famed for its conceptual shows and the platform it
gives to new, exciting and experimental art, has maximised a great opportunity
in using the space in a chartered architect's office in Stafford Street to
display works by artists usually housed in their Collective Gallery 3 and its
not very display-orientated pigeon holes.
About 20 artists have contributed, some giving the requested four pieces, some
more, some less. Placed in this rather formal Georgian space all the works
function remarkably well, contrasting successfully with their surroundings.
Most media are represented - sculpture, printing, painting and crafts - and
prices are set deliberately low in this season of goodwill. Collective artists
must sell as well as create!
Most are small works but there are some striking pieces - Helen Denderley's Tap
o' Noth, a wonderful copper stork ensconced in the fireplace; Alistair Mack's
bright abstract poster forms; Arabella Crum Ewing's witty Tiger Tiger; and
Henry Kondracki's unfocused works, eerie and provocative. Shona MacDonald and
Fiona Strickland both use abstraction but MacDonald's work responds to the
landscapes of the Highlands and the Western Isles while Strickland's seems more
concerned with internal states.
Tove Hirth's sculpture uses simple forms in bronze and marble - Single Figure
is a simplified model, smoothed into its material. Susan Dayal's figures and
shapes in twisted metal strands are amusing and seasonal - the Collective
Gallery itself has a large angel of her design in its window. The freshness and
enthusiasm of this seasonal show speaks highly of the gallery's encouragement
and the strength of its own philosophy.

As the Communists continue to     make inroads in Eastern Europe,
Tom Gallagher considers the implications for Western leaders
THE silencing of the guns in Bosnia will not banish the problems of Eastern
Europe from our midst in 1996. The turmoil produced by the release of
nationalist tensions kept in the deep freeze of communism for 40 years, along
with the often chaotic transition from a state-led economy to one where
competition prevails and widespread poverty is the norm, is likely to generate
fresh unrest. Meanwhile, Russia is poised to reassert itself in former
satellites and in states which broke away from the Soviet Union in 1991.
Moscow is already insisting that the expansion of Nato into central Europe will
be viewed as a hostile act even though countries like Poland and Hungary no
longer share a common border with Russia proper; for some time Russia has been
using economic blackmail and covert military intervention to impose its will on
weak neighbours like Georgia, a trend likely to continue despite the military
drubbing received in Chechnya.
At least some of the most lurid predictions about Europe's unruly East have not
come to pass. Remarkably, given the weak legitimacy enjoyed by many of the
elected governments in former Warsaw Pact states, none has yet been overturned
by force.
Nor have the predictions about uncontrollable movements of population westwards
from economically stricken lands been borne out. Thankfully, speculation that
the Bosnia conflict would spread to other parts of the former Yugoslavia riven
by ethnic or territorial splits, have also failed to materialise. But places
like Kosovo and the Sandjak, where Serbia has tried to hold down non-Serb
majority populations, are likely to become more restive, especially as
President Milosevic's authority has been eroded with the failure of his Greater
Serbia dream.
The car bomb which nearly ended the life of Macedonia's President Gligorov on
November 3 showed how dependent an alarming number of states are on the
longevity of a single individual able to reconcile sharp internal differences.
Mafia interests, rather than any of Macedonia's competing ethnic groups, are
increasingly viewed as the most likely culprits. While the West has been
preoccupied with the Yugoslav conflict, organised crime has moved into several
of the Baltic States and Bulgaria to organise drug-trafficking and the booming
arms market.
Such states have scant protection against international crime syndicates long
used to penetrating the defences of sophisticated Western countries.
Russian and Italian mafia groups have met to plan operations and agree on
spheres of influence, showing an ability to co-operate that has so far eluded
Western bodies and states with a stake in a peaceful and democratic Eastern
Europe.
There is a real danger that mafia interests could establish a hold over parts
of Eastern Europe where the state is weak and officials are too easily bribed
or coerced, on par with what has happened in Colombia. The black economy is
expanding in the old Eastern bloc sometimes faster than the legitimate one and,
through new technology, blackmail, and terror, criminal gangs are carving out
fiefdoms in several places, above all Russia.
It will be ironic if it is criminal para-states subverting Western liberal
democracies by dumping arms, hard drugs, and other illicit goods that emerge as
the main security danger from the East by the end of the millennium. Why?
Because all the evidence suggests that there has been little contingency
planning in Western Europe to guard against such an eventuality.
Organised crime is bound to flourish in the midst of tumbling living standards
when desperate citizens can be persuaded to break the law in big and small ways
in a bid to survive. A 1994 United Nations report claimed that the enormous
spread and depth of the economic decline among the former communist states of
the region exceeds in magnitude the catastrophe that engulfed the major
capitalist economies during the Great Depression. Free institutions are being
tried out in the midst of sharply declining living and health standards and
it's no surprise that, as in Russia, conventional parties insisting that better
times will follow on from austerity, are greeted with incredulity and mounting
anger.
Ex-communist parties, some of which, as in Poland and Hungary, have made
genuine conversions to social democracy, have benefited from popular
dissatisfaction with advocates of economic shock-therapy. But the moderate-left
governments, mainly to be found in Eastern Europe, could themselves come under
pressure from populist movements if they are unable            to offer hope
to unskilled workers, young mothers, or pensioners, groups which have borne the
brunt of the changes seen since 1989.
Lech Walesa, Poland's recently defeated President, looks ready to put himself
at the head of an army of the dissatisfied and discard the political rule book
in a bid to make a comeback. His example could be emulated by other firebrands
in countries which lack Poland's relatively healthy economic position. Russia
is perhaps the country in the region which stands the greatest chance of
abandoning democracy for a form of strong-arm rule. General Alexander Lebed, a
nationalist intent on reclaiming Russia's superpower status, is already making
a strong challenge for the Presidency held by an infirm Boris Yeltsin in
elections due in June.
Fear of a new wave of Russian imperialism is the main reason why states like
Poland and Hungary and the Baltic States are eager to join Nato. The entry of
the former Eastern bloc states into both Nato and the European Union is the
main focus of their foreign policy. However, Western policy-makers are split.
The Clinton administration and most West-European leaders fear that expansion
of Nato will revive in Russia the impression of a threat from the West. But the
assertive US Republicans argue that the failure to provide security guarantees
to countries whose liberation from tyranny was a key policy aim during the cold
war, threatens the return of a new Iron Curtain where the Baltic States and
perhaps others will be at the mercy of the prevailing mood in Moscow.
Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian Foreign Minister, warned in March that Nato
expansion would help to kill off democracy in Russia. Pavel Felgengauer, a
journalist with close ties to the Russian Defence Ministry was even blunter in
September when he warned of the likely consequences of Nato actually deploying
troops eastwards: ``Russia's future reaction to any attempt to deploy foreign
troops near its borders ..... will be exactly the same as Washington's reaction
when (Soviet) troops landed in Cuba. First, there will be a blockade, then if
an ultimatum is not complied with, there will be a preventive strike that would
deprive the adversary of offensive capabilities.''
It looks as if these stark Russian warnings are being heeded at Nato
headquarters and that countries like Poland will only be offered conditional
links with the Western alliance for the foreseeable future. But the potential
for conflict remains, particularly between Russia and its neighbour, Ukraine.
Many Russians see the Ukraine as being a quintessentially Russian land and
believe that its independence will only be a passing phenomenon. But the
Ukrainian Government shows no sign of bending to Russia's will despite a
parlous economic situation.
Conflict over oil and gas supplies, the Russian Black Sea fleet or the large
Russian minority in Eastern Ukraine, could become flashpoints if, by mid-1996,
the Kremlin is occupied by a nationalist determined to throw his weight around.
Russian and American troops will soon be serving alongside one another in
Bosnia as part of the force implementing the Dayton peace agreement. If the
Bosnia Peace Implementation Council created in London on December 10 is true to
its name, then US-Russian co-operation in the Balkans could help to lift
suspicions about Western intentions in Eastern Europe.
But if the Bosnian peace breaks down, there is no shortage of worrying
scenarios to contemplate. What will happen if Russian and US troops, each
answering to their own commanders, disagree on whether to use force against
Serb forces that will not comply with the terms of the agreement? Will Russian
troops defend Serbian forces?
As they fly to Sarajevo and perhaps new trouble-spots in the making during
1996, Western leaders might have cause to feel nostalgic for the relatively
straightforward political geography of Europe that existed before the Berlin
Wall was taken down. But if enough will and imagination are shown, the West
could help to stabilise Eastern Europe and give hope to its ill-used citizens.
For that to happen statesmen are required who will give the problems of the
region their undivided attention in the critical years that lie ahead.
Fear of a new wave of Russian imperialism is why some states are eager to join
Nato

STEPHEN DALDRY, a leading contender to take over the National Theatre next
year, has announced that Royal Court, where he is currently artistic director,
will be moving from next September to the Ambassadors Theatre as a replacement
for its Royal Court Upstairs Theatre.
It is an unexpected, high-risk choice, the Ambassadors, home for many years to
Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, will give the Sloane Square theatre, which is
already running a season of ``Court classics'' at the Duke of York's, their
second foothold in the West End. At the same time the move will inject a
timely, not to say spicy, spirit into a West End largely dominated by safety
and the lavish musical.
For the Court's Upstairs Theatre has, for the past 20 years, been the seedbed
of unknown, often controversial, writers. Only this year, Sarah Kane's Blasted
became a cause celebre because of its explicit treatment of contemporary
violence. Daldry followed up his Ambassadors' announcement with the realease of
the schedule of plays to be produced in Sloane Square up to June, and took the
opportunity to flesh out the details of the #20m redevelopment scheme the
theatre will be embarking on in September when it closes for two years.
It is hard keeping up with Daldry these days. The man - and the Royal Court -
appear unstoppable. There is no doubt Daldry has revitalised the Court's
reputation as a powerhouse of new writing - recalling the heady days of the
mid-1950s - but he has also given it the place an additional buzz that suggests
that whatever you may actually think of the play currently on stage, something
very special and electric is going on.
His own work-rate and choice of plays is generating much of this excitement.
Productions seem to come at the audience at high velocity, pumping violent
energy. But beyond that Daldry is a man with a vision - probably unrivalled in
London at the moment - of where theatre can go as we approach the end of the
millennium. His plans for the Ambassadors (reducing the seating, lifting the
stage level to the circle), and those for the listed building in Sloane Square
(opening up areas front and back, extending the front-of-house into the square)
- extend not just to the plays and where they are coming from (a new wave of
Irish writers is apparently imminent) but the relationship of those plays to
the stage and that of the public to the buildings themselves.
It can all make for a frantic time for those riding alongside the chap Royal
Court chairman and Rumpole creator John Mortimer describes as a ``man who lives
for life, love, and excitement''. So it would be fascinating if this dynamism
was to be rechannelled in a different direction as successor to Richard Eyre at
the National on the South Bank.
The odds are certainly shortening. Amidst intense speculation and considerable
criticism, the lumbering, institutional machinery has now been set in motion to
establish Eyre's successor.

SEVEN million people a year slip on uneven, or damaged pavements or on wet
leaves, snow, ice or uncleared litter, according to the latest survey by the
National Consumer Council which concludes that Britain's pavements are a
walking disaster.
In the decade since the council's last survey, there has been no improvement in
the accident rate with 22% of people reporting an accident on the pavement in
the previous 12 months. There is no official tally of pavement accidents, but
the NCC estimates that nearly half a million people required medical attention
after falling on unsafe pavements.
Interesting regional differences resulted from the sample of 2045 divided
between 149 sampling points. Uncleared snow and ice are more of a problem in
Scotland than elsewhere, reported by 23% compared with 11% in the south of
England. Most Scottish interviewees thought problems with litter were less
severe than people in other areas, but in line with the rest of Britain, the
main causes of dirty streets were drink containers and dog-fouling. Scots,
however, were least likely to favour punitive measures for dog owners and
litterers.
Only 48% of Scots favoured on-the-spot fines for owners whose dogs fouled
pavements compared with 58% in the North of England, 55% in the South of
England, and 49% in the Midlands and Wales. On-the-spot fines for dropping
litter increase in popularity from north to south, being favoured by 34% of
people in Scotland, by 35% in the North of England, 37% in the Midlands and 38%
in the South.
In Scotland, the regions' roads departments are responsible for maintaining
pavements, but litter clearing is the duty of the district councils. Although
the consumer council's survey reported that fewer people thought litter was a
problem compared with their 1986 survey, the director of Keep Scotland
Beautiful, Mr Douglas Wright, said: ``People are still going on cascading
litter about their environment.''
The group is to carry out its own city-centre surveys in Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Dundee, and Aberdeen in April and May next year, when they will put to the test
a promise made over a year ago by Councillor Pat Lally, that Glasgow's streets
would become as clean as Singapore's.
The NCC survey ranked the main causes of litter in the same order as in 1991:
drink cans and bottles (60%), dog dirt (54%), and fast-food wrappers and boxes
(52%). Other hazards identified by the consumer council were narrow and uneven
pavements, unfinished roadworks, and pedestrian crossings in inconvenient
places.
They want the needs of pedestrians to be given much higher priority, pointing
out that almost everyone is a pedestrian at some point in their daily round.
They call for local authorities to carry out further research to identify the
problems in their own areas and develop ways of using the responses of
pedestrians in their planning and for councils and the police to use existing
powers to enforce anti-litter laws and vehicle regulations.
Strathclyde Region said that a small proportion of calls on the Roads and
Lighting Faults Freephone (0800 373635) were about dangerous pavements. Their
spokesman added that excavation by the public utilities and the television
cable-laying companies was co-ordinated as far as possible at the beginning of
each financial year. He said the region was satisfied that pavements were being
properly reinstated after cable-laying.

AT a time when performing organisations in the major urban centres are
experiencing a downturn in audiences, the Scottish Bach Consort all but filled
this capacious church for an undeniably populist but very well-played
programme, under the slightly misleading title of A Baroque Christmas.
There were certainly seasonal elements, including the three carols which
concluded the programme and the presence of a certain gentleman in a
red-and-white suit as one of the five dignitaries invited to play the toy
instruments in Haydn's Toy Symphony.
Not even the surprise presence of conductor James Loughran could bring much in
the way of ensemble discipline to this lot, but their enthusiasm carried the
day. Ensemble discipline is very much part of the Consort's make-up, however,
and they demonstrated that quality in a fine performance of Vivaldi's Four
Seasons.
John Doig led by example from first violin, and his players responded with
crisp, controlled playing. Doig had invited four young soloists to perform one
movement each, beginning with a confident reading of Spring from Jane
Sidebottom, followed by Alison Dixon's aggressive Summer, Elaine Clark's
beautifully understated and finely pitched Autumn, and Louise Webster's bold,
assured Winter.
The solo violin and cello were poorly integrated in an exposed section of
Summer, but it was hard for even the finicky to pick fault elsewhere, in a
performance which approached this most familiar of all pieces with commendable
freshness.
A satisfying evening for the locals, then, and one made all the more so for one
delighted Blanefield youngster, who found herself the winner of a training
violin. The Consort clearly believe in taking care of the next generation as
well.

MATTHEW Francis has struck gold with this exuberant revival of Tom Stoppard's
brilliant riposte to Hamlet. Francis's best production by far, it captures
Stoppard's dazzling games with beguiling imagination and energy.
On this showing, and despite the fact that Stoppard over gilds the lily by
simply going on too long, it emerges as one of the great comic plays of the
past 30 years and perhaps explains to a totally new generation the reason for
the writer's pre-eminence.
Stoppard transforms those two supporting characters into a glorious music-hall
duo, as well as juggling imperiously with the art of performing, the laws of
probability and, heart-stoppingly on occasion, the subject of death -
characters who ``simply fail to appear'' as Simon Russell Beale's warm, wise,
often puzzled, Guilderstern puts it.
But Rosencrantz and Guilderstern is also about anything the magic of theatrical
transformation. Here Francis not only draws out from Alan Howard as the Player
King one of his most expansive performances, full of grandeur and delicious
self-irony, but also creates haunting musical tableaux from the accompanying
group of strolling players that seem to cover the globe in their musical
references.
At its heart, though, are the two wonderful fall guys. Shameless steals from
Waiting for Godot's Vladimir and Estragon, Rosencrantz and Guilderstern are
dressed here in a drab khaki echo of Elizabethan doublet and hose and played by
Russell Beale and Adrian Scarborough as every inch the humble, subordinate
pawns they are.
Pushed hither and thither within the grander theatrical and human life design,
they are a sublime mixture of affronted bewilderment, philosophical angst and
student innocence.

Fishermen face further quota cuts in the fishing grounds around their coast.
Graeme Smith examines the issue that has split Scotland's hard-hit fishing
industry - and how it could spell trouble for the Government
THE row which has split Conservative loyalties and could result in an
embarrassing defeat for the Prime Minister in the Commons tonight has already
divided the Scottish fishing industry.
There is not a fishermen in the land who would say he is happy with the Common
Fisheries Policy (CFP) but they are split on the way to resolve the problem.
Fishermen are incensed because the CFP has meant, for example, that if they
catch over-quota fish, even accidentally, they have to throw the catch back
into the sea.
Many are risking prosecution by clandestine landing of ``black fish'' - fish
which is not declared - because they need the money to maintain the viability
of their operation. Last night there was a warning that tonight's debate should
not be allowed to move from the crucial issue - how much fish the UK's
fishermen will be allowed to catch next year - if political point-scoring is on
the agenda.
The powerful Scottish Fishermen's Federation believes it is impractical and
illegal to withdraw from the CFP but many fishermen are demanding exactly that
as they face further quota cuts in the fishing grounds around their own coast.
The SFF now face opposition in the form of The Fishermen's Association, a
fledgling organisation which was born out of discontent among members of the
Scottish White Fish Producers' Association because it would not back the Save
Britain's Fish Campaign which supports withdrawal.
The SFF, however, stresses it is ``not pro CFP, just pro reality''. ``If we are
going to make life any easier for our fishermen we have to campaign for
change,'' said Mr Bob Allan, chief executive of the SFF. ``This debate is about
next year's Total Allowable Catches, we don't see it as a debate on the CFP.
``We have never prescribed to the view that it is either legally or politically
possible to withdraw from the CFP therefore we don't see the relevance of that
to this debate. Our concern with this debate is that there is a package of TACs
on the table, including a proposed EC-Norway agreement about which we have
several major concerns.''
He said these included concerns over quotas for North Sea herring and whiting
and for Western mackerel and nephrops. ``There is nothing in this debate that
is going to turn the world upside down. What we want the debate to concentrate
on is improving the package on the table at the moment.
``If this debate is concentrated solely on the CFP it will be akin to pouring
the baby out with the bathwater. At the end of the day it is the TAC agreement
that is up for negotiation in Brussels later this week and we would like to see
MPs using the debate to stiffen the resolve of ministers to improve the TAC
available at the moment.''
Yesterday the secretary of The Fishermen's Association, Mr Roddy McColl, said
it was doing very well with more than 100 members since its formation in
mid-October, mainly from the North-east and Moray Firth coasts.
``We have a desire for the UK to regain its own exclusive fishing zone and
exercise control over that and enter into bilateral agreements with other
countries,'' he said.
``We always knew there was support from Tory MPs concerned at the stance of the
Government on Europe, particularly on fishing and the national asset which is
being continually eroded.
``Our main concern is that as member states become fully integrated to the CFP
they get greater access to waters that were originally fished by the UK. That
creates pressures on UK fishing vessels and in turn results in more vessels
being forced to operate in a way that is not viable or if it is viable it is
being done in a way that criminalises them.''
Mr McColl said they were being forced to dump fish, which was not in the
interests of conservation or the fishermen.
``This is happening because the Common Fisheries Policy is a flawed instrument
of management and because it is flawed, and doesn't protect the interests of
the coastal state which has the greatest share of fish, namely the UK, then
fishermen realise they have to look at a different approach to protecting their
interests rather than the traditional means of trying to change the CFP.''
He said they believed it was legally possible for the UK to withdraw and there
were political and economic issues that had to be addressed in trying to
achieve that objective.

<HEADLINE>Abtrust on sound footing</HEADLINE>

ABERDEEN Trust (Abtrust) has weathered a difficult year quite well and is now
solidly focussed on fund management after shedding its loss-making accountancy
division.
Funds under management rose 16.4% to #2700m during the year to September 30,
mainly reflecting Abtrust's purchase of #240m of unit trust funds from Century
Life in December 1994.
The Aberdeen-based fund manager opened a new office in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, to manage its small but growing asset base in Latin America.
It also beefed up its Singapore operation, which manages over #400m of funds in
the Far East, and recruited more UK personnel in sales and marketing.
Although rising costs squeezed margins, operating profits on continuing
business rose 8.9% to #6.8m. But pre-tax profits fell 17.7% to #4.2m, dragged
down by #1.9m of losses and administrative costs arising from the sale of six
accountancy businesses in the second half of the financial year.
Despite this setback, Abtrust felt confident enough to raise the total dividend
by 25% to 2.5p with a final payout of 1.8p. Its shares, which have recovered
steadily from a nadir of 22p in August 1992, edged up !sp, but then in late
trade to close down 2!sp at 109p.
The purchase of new unit trust business and the disposal of the accountancy
division have put Abtrust on a sounder footing.
About 93% of revenue now flows from recurring fee income. This insulates the
company from fluctuations in other one-off forms of income which may vary with
the ups and downs of the investment market - especially the sort of downs seen
this year in Latin America and the Far East.
An improvement in the UK stock market helped Abtrust recover from a poor start
to the financial year. Since it ended the company has raised more than #50m of
new funds.
Finance director Bill Rattray said Abtrust had not made any move to acquire
Dunedin Fund Managers, the troubled fund management arm of Bank of Scotland,
which has suffered a haemorrhage of key personnel in recent months. But he said
he would not rule out buying Dunedin if Bank of Scotland decided to sell. ``If
there is an opportunity we will look at it,'' he said.
Abtrust's main aim, however, is to expand by organic growth, particularly in
the lucrative unit trust business, which accounts for nearly 40% of revenue.

<HEADLINE>Fund manager's vote crucial in battle for UK firm as Norwegians are rebuffed after war of words Kvaerner fails in Amec takeover bid</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ANDREW WILSON</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

THE #360m Kvaerner bid for Britain's Amec has failed with the Norwegian
shipbuilder and engineering company receiving acceptances for just 10.4% of the
Ordinary and 28.2% of the Preference shares.
As Kvaerner had acquired 26.1% of the Ordinary stock through market purchases,
its total in that class amounted to just 36.5% and so the bid lapsed.
The crucial decision was taken by fund manager PDFM with 14% of the shares who
decided to stick with Amec's chairman Sir Alan Cockshaw, who is giving up his
executive powers, and in-coming new chief executive Peter Mason.
He was recruited from construction group Balfour Beatty and so is well versed
in major international construction contracts which will provide the vast bulk
of Amec's future activity given the slackness in the UK.
Technically Amec is a substantial company helped by its purchase of Matthew
Hall which brought in expertise in oil rig to sides, nuclear and large scale
power station installation which are in increasing demand in the Far East.
But it has sadly disappointed over the years.
Despite promises of better things to come, dividends have been cut and capital
values eroded with the last rights issue in 1991 at 200p contrasting with this
year's low point of 53p before Kvaerner took its initial 2% holding in June.
The takeover attempt seems set to go down in the annals of the City as being
one of the most extraordinary ever launched.
It included the sacking of Amec's public relations firm Financial Dynamics
after one of its directors passed on unauthorised profit foreasts for 1996 to a
very major broking house. That came to light when the analyst concerned
initially denied that he had received the call but then the Takeover Panel
demanded that the house compliance officer send it the tape recording of the
conversation which brought the matter into the open.
Amec tried to entice fellow construction group Alfred McAlpine into a merger in
a deal which valued its own shares at 70p. That compared with the 100p which
Kvaerner's chairman Erik Tonseth had paid in a dawn raid using SBC Warburg
which netted another 10% before it made its formal offer for the rest of the
equity.
A Japanese company with which Amec had joint ventures intervened for a few
moments. That set pulses racing when it bought stock at 101p, raising hopes of
a counter-offer before denying any interest.
Then the Indonesian minister for research and technology Yusuf Habibie wrote to
deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine saying that it was important that Amec
remain independent - Kvaerner riposted by sending out a list of its Indonesian
contracts.
And as recently as last Saturday, former trade and industry minister Richard
Needham threw his weight behind Amec, saying that the UK would be severely
disadvantaged without companies like Amec able to win exports.
The battle was probably decided by many funds concluding that Amec represented
a two-way bet as they are not convinced that Kvaerner will do anything for
quite some time and so the share price, down 3p at 93p for most of yesterday is
underpinned.
That SBC Warburg had introduced a 21-day time limit caused some considerable
irritation, some spoke of bully-boy tactics.
If Amec does meet its promises, then all should be satisfied with Kvaerner even
seeing a profit at the end of the day.

SOURLY Jane Austen once observed that the sooner a party broke, the better.
However, the real problem with parties is not knowing when to leave, but when
to arrive. Appear on time and you catch the hostess in the shower, or the
sitting room still looking like a break-in by the Springboks. Turn up too late
and the exchange of pleasantries among the gathering has become either so
intense or so intimate any newcomer seems like an intruder.
Worst of all, if, by miscalculation, you land on the threshold of a formal
party 15 minutes too soon, the organisers off-handedly presume you're the
caterer.
There is but one solution to such gaffes, and that is the old Venetian trick of
wearing a party mask. Thus, if you see displeasure simmering in the eyes of
your hosts as they open the door, you can always pretend you are a foreigner
who picked the wrong address, then, with some flourish, turn and vanish into
the night.
A drastic reaction, but not half as bad as being the first couple of guests
present and being dumped in the living-room while the hosts retreat to the
kitchen, insisting that they don't need any help with the cooking. There are
two possible reasons for this: either they are in the middle of a blazing row,
or they are dishing up Marks and Spencer a la carte.
In the meantime, what are you supposed to do? Inspect the bric-a-brac, the book
titles? Discuss the finer points of monetary union, or the merits of soft-shoe
shuffle over weight lifting? Whatever you choose, avoid domestic nagging. There
is nothing elegant about using someone else's home to cross-question a partner
on why he/she didn't pick up the dry cleaning on the way home, or why he/she
must always be the one to take out the garbage.
Back in the kitchen, the hosts will be fuming into the bouillabaisse: ``What do
they mean, arriving at 7.30pm when the card specifically said 7.30pm for 8pm?
Couldn't they have had enough sensitivity to hide in the bushes? And what do
they expect of a party anyway, room service?''
There are always two sides to every invitation, for parties are survival games
where self-confidence and charm notch up a major advantage, but not if your
hosts resemble articulate rattlesnakes and are determined to make the rest of
the assembly feel like the threatened bit players in Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?
A friend recalls one dreadful soiree thrown by a couple who were so seething
with one another, they simply ignored providing any kind of refreshment, so
that by 10pm, the rest of the party rose as one, collected its hats and coats
and headed off for a nearby Indian restaurant, never to return. Which might,
indeed, have been the wretched hosts' intention all along.
According to Francoise Dumas, known internationally as one of the great social
entrepreneurs, the perfect party includes a princess, a politician, and an
influential writer. This ritzy fraternity was evident at that New York bash the
other night where soldier/author Colin Powell spoke of his relationship to the
Princess of Wales while the world's most improbable ladies' man, Henry
Kissinger, leered down her decolletage. These days, of course, the most
difficult thing, even for someone with Dumas's Who's Who finesse, is how to
ensure you don't invite the wife and the mistress to the same event.
It is also amazing, given so much evidence to the contrary, how many people
persist with the notion that office parties spread goodwill among co-workers.
The fatal mistake seems to dwell in attempts to pass off people with different
levels of power as a jolly bunch of equals. It doesn't work. It leads to
trouble. As the otherwise carefully observed demarcation lines begin to wobble,
the office party slumps into bleary recriminations, with some button-holing
dumbo chuntering into the face of the chairman: ``So, what makes you think
you're not an over-stuffed lump of mediocrity, matey?''
Such challenges are always better left unsaid. Which is why the button-holing
dumbo keeps his mouth shut during the rest of the year. But according to guides
on social etiquette the ideal office Christmas party should begin before lunch
with the boss announcing that everyone may cancel the rest of the day. This, in
fact, is the most simple and pleasant invitation any person in authority can
offer. It costs little, delights everyone and, above all, it doesn't leave the
office strewn with dead sandwiches and the shrapnel of so many intricate
follies.

KEVIN Campbell was celebrating last night after marking his first game in the
Forest side for three months with the equalising goal. The #2.5m summer signing
from Arsenal cancelled out Uwe Rosler's opener.
Forest have now shared the points in 10 of their 17 Premiership matches and
manager Frank Clark said: ``We have drawn too many games. It has stopped us
getting in among the leaders.
``Kevin has played only three reserve games in three months. The goal will give
him a little lift. It is a big difference at this level. I didn't expect him to
last the full 90 minutes, that's why I substituted him with eight minutes to
go.''
City have lost only one match in their past seven after a dreadful start and
manager Alan Ball said: ``We are light years away from where we were seven
weeks ago. To most people we were dead and buried.
``Now we come up against teams like Forest, we have the confidence to try and
take them on and try to outpass them.'' It was Rosler's first goal in the
Premiership for 15 matches over four months. His goal was a classic move with a
class finish. Niall Quinn knocked the ball through to Lomas, who made space on
the right and whipped in a cross. Rosler reacted quickly to deliver the perfect
strike past keeper Mark Crossley.
Campbell's eqauliser came in 69 minutes, with City on the rack. Scot Gemmill
whipped in a corner that was touched on by Jason Lee, and Campbell scooped the
ball in from almost on the goal-line.

A MEMBER of Falkirk District Council has just delivered a note to all his
colleagues. It is not seasonal greetings that Councillor William Buchanan is
sending but notice of his consumption of a piece of humble pie.
As the cooncillor explains in his own words: ``A few weeks ago at a meeting of
Falkirk council housing committee, I was speaking on a number of subjects, one
item was in relation to anti-social tenants who are making some of their
neighbours lives a misery and when describing these idiots I called them
nignogs. This term has always been used to describe idiots and I have been
called this many time in my life.
``I was therefore distraught that a racial connotation was attached to this, on
reflection I can understand that this terminology could offend and therefore I
do apologise to anyone who may have taken offence, I will however never
apologise for lambasting these anti-social tenants who continue to make peoples
lives a misery.
``PS. It think it is sad that someone left that meeting to telephone the press,
to try and discredit a councillor knowing full well that what the councillor
said was taken in the wrong context but was twisted for their own ends.''
To be fair to Councillor Buchanan (well, it is Christmas) Chambers dictionary's
first definition of nig-nog is ``a fool, a raw recruit to the army or to a
civilian service''. The second definition is the dreaded offensive reference to
``a person of a dark-skinned race''.
Lift that bale
IT'S official. There it is in the Guardian Media Guide for 1996. Under the
heading Ethnic Groups and listed between Scottish Asian Action Committee and
the Standing Conference of West Indian Organisations, we find the Scottish
Crofter's Union. Tote that peat, lift that bale, you have a little dram and you
end in jail.
Twist in the tale
SCOTLAND'S members of Parliament gathered in Glasgow to discuss the Rave Bill.
Or the Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill as it is more prosaically called
by the Scottish Grand Committee.
The proceedings were a bit of a rave in themselves what with the Government
setting down precise definitions of ``dancing'' and ``music''. Dancing we are
told includes any movement apparently to the accompaniment of music.
Music ``includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission
of a succession of repetitive beats''. This definition allowed Phil Gallie,
Tory MP for Ayr, to give the members of the Grand Committee a lecture on
popular music, including a Very Brief History of Rock and Roll.
Phil said: ``Along came rock and roll and we all thought it was the end of the
world. But it was just a phase. Then the twist came . . .'' All this without
the benefit of Ecstasy.
No place like home
ONE of the patrons of the recent Labour Party fund-raising dinner was the
Global Video chain. We are sure it was no comment whatsoever on the quality of
the speeches from Tony Blair and company that Global should place a full-page
advert in the programme with the words: ``Wouldn't you rather be at home
watching a video?''
Come and get it
JUST when you had totally despaired of finding something different for
Christmas for the person in your life, does Lobey Dosser, the wee sheriff of
Calton Creek, not come riding in to the rescue. At the last minute as usual.
With desperate rather than perfect timing, Dosser Industries announces the
arrival of a range of goodies inspired by Bud Neill's famous cartoon strip. The
range has been produced by the Halt Bar which is located opposite the Lobey
Dosser statue in Woodlands Road, Glasgow.
A window in the Halt Bar has been turned into a shrine for Lobey Dosser. The
display also explains what the two-legged equestrian statue is all about for
the benefit of totally confused tourists.
The first range of Dosser merchandise consists of umbrellas (#18.99), ties
(#9.99), T-shirts (#9.99), pens (#1.95), and jigsaws (#4.95). Part of the
profits will go towards the Lobey Dosser Statue Maintenance Fund.
Now you know
GREAT Greetings (Contd): Scots Tung, the organisation dedicated ``tae attain
the same status for Scots as ither lesser yaised European languages'' sends us
a card biddin us a blithe Yule. Our dictionary translates this as an injunction
to have a jocund, gay, or sprightly Christmas.
The Scots Tungers have penned a Yule poem which includes this verse:
An in yon smeekie stirkie's
sta'
They fund a holy bairn sae
braw,
An loutin doon tak oot their
gear,
Gowd, frankincense an
myrrh.
From this we learn that the manger was particularly smelly and that, in Scots,
myrrh ryhmes with gear.
New arrivals
MORE arrivals at the stable in Bethlehem in the Langs Supreme Whisky Name the
Fourth Wise Man competition:
q John Gummer bearing the right to buy the stable. Closely followed by a
Bethlehem District Council housing officer allowing Jesus the right to go on a

MOTHERWELL remain beset by problems, but they go into tonight's game against
Rangers determined to prove themselves more resilient than most outsiders
think, writes James Traynor. Also, they feel a win against the defending
premier division champions could act as a powerful incentive to lift themselves
away from the relegation area.
They refuse to feel sorry for themselves and even though Dougie Arnott, who has
a flu virus, is doubtful for the game the manager, Alex McLeish, clings to the
belief that one day soon Motherwell's luck will change.
The story of Motherwell's campaign so far is to be told in one statistic which
shows that at this same point last season they were 18 goals better off. They
have been without their main striker, Tommy Coyne, for a lengthy spell because
of a knee problem and McLeish asked: ``Can you imagine what even a third of
those goals would have done for us?''
Having drawn eight of their 17 matches so far they wouldn't be bottom had their
strike rate been better and if Arnott doesn't recover in time the Lanarkshire
side might be pushed to finish off any chances they might create.
Brian Martin, who had a hamstring problem, was unable to train last week but he
should be at the heart of the defence this evening although John Hendry is
unavailable after having hurt a knee.
Whatever happens it is McLeish's intention to continue with the passing game
which served Motherwell well last season.

A TIMELY currency hedge against the falling yen and increased borrowings helped
Edinburgh Japan Trust leap ahead of its benchmark index in the six months to
November 30, writes KRISTY DORSEY.
Net asset valued soared 16.2% to 165p, while the Tokyo First Section Index rose
only 2.3% in sterling terms.
The #46.3m trust, which is handled by Edinburgh Fund Managers, benefitted from
#3.8m of additional borrowings, which took gearing up to 16% from 12%.
It also hedged 40% of its assets against a fall in the yen and adopted an
investment strategy based on Japanese economic recovery.
Net asset value rose 6.5% in the six months to October 31, under-performing a
7.8% increase in the FT S&amp;P Actuaries Pacific (excluding Japan) Index.

SABIC staff are proud of a particular symbol which represents the results of
their therapy programmes. It is a large hallway board now filled with dozens of
colour photographs of children of all ages and suffering from many different
varieties of brain injury who have come to their clinic at the David Elder
Hospital in Govan, Glasgow.
Names and some other details have been changed as a matter of policy, but from
the case histories available, they regard these examples as typical.
q DAVID has a case history which begins in l989, when he was eight years of
age. Diagnosed as having Microcephaly, he suffered many fits and could not
walk. He had hearing aids and very thick glasses. Eighteen months after
commencing a programme, he could walk by himself, he did not need his hearing
aids, and his optical prescription was halved in strength. His fits decreased
and he came off the medication he had received for eight years.
q STEVEN's case history began in l993. He is three years old. Nobody could
define his condition. All day he was hyperactive. He had cried constantly since
birth and very seldom slept. His mother contacted SABIC when looking for the
Samaritans in Yellow Pages. SABIC's name was beside theirs. His first
assessment revealed that Steven had no sensory information to his brain. He
would bite his brother and friend until he drew blood. Because he was not aware
of pain he did not register pain in other people. After three months of a
programme, Steven now sleeps all night, plays with his brother, and reads well.
SABIC staff rate him as highly intelligent.
q SUSAN, now three-and-a-half, was diagnosed by doctors at three weeks old as
Microcephalic and given no hope for the future. Her parents were told she was
likely to be a vegetable.
She commenced a therapy programme in July l993 aged l4 months. At that time she
could not move forward on her tummy. Her mobility was at new-born level. She
can now walk and run independently and her favourite pastime is trampolining.
She can speak, can count up to 20, and has an ``insatiable'' appetite for
reading picture and word flashcards.
q LISA, now aged five, was brain damaged at birth due to oxygen starvation and
her parents were given a diagnosis of cerebral palsy and severe mental handcap.
She had loud breathing and recurrent chest infections. Her feeding problems
became so severe that she was put on naso-gastric feeds. In December l993 a
gastrostomy operation - a feeding tube direct into her stomach - was
recommended.
Her parents did not wish this and last year she began a SABIC programme. ``She
now eats normally and can chew food,'' says her case history. ``She is more
vocal and has a wide range of sounds.'' Breathing is silent, eyesight has
improved, limbs have loosened and developed muscles. She now moves forward on
her tummy and her general health has improved.''
q NATHAN, aged l5, suffered severe brain damage in a road accident in l993.
Placed on a life support machine, he was not expected to live. After he had
been in a coma for three months in a Scottish hospital, SABIC were allowed to
implement a coma arousal programme and he emerged from coma within three weeks.
Taken home by his family after spending six months in an NHS head injuries
unit, he began a SABIC therapy programme last year. He can now walk
independently for short distances, get in and out of a car with ease, dress
himself, drink from a cup, feed himself, and go to the toilet.
The SABIC report adds that Nathan now speaks spontaneously and his eyesight,
which was diagnosed as functionally blind, is improving.

THE reward for a trouble-free European Football Championship match between
England and Scotland at Wembley on June 15 could be the reinstatement of the
Auld Enemy annual fixture, shelved in 1989 after persistent hooliganism.
By and large, the authorities in England have laid blame for past troubles on
over-enthusiastic Scottish supporters who perhaps enjoyed too much of the
national beverage before and after games at Wembley.
However, Graham Kelly, chief executive of the Football Association, yesterday
offered the carrot of a resumption of the contest as a realistic possibility,
if all goes well at Wembley.
Over the past year Kelly had been involved in talks with the SFA about reviving
the oldest international fixture in the game - the first meeting was in Glasgow
in 1872. There was total agreement that it should be reinstated, he said, but
there were always problems in finding space in the calendar.
The draw for the European Championship had resolved that problem. It would be
up to supporters of both nations to prove that the fixture could be
reintroduced.
However, Scottish fans will face impossible odds in getting a ticket for this
game. Already they are gold. Despite a meeting in Birmingham yesterday to
increase the allocation set for Scotland, any additional tickets bound for
Scotland - and it will be only a few thousand more - could never meet the
demand. Most of the tickets for the Wembley games went on sale last year and
are already accounted for.
Everybody involved in preparing for the championships, not least the police,
believe that the danger of potential trouble at Wembley is being exaggerated.
As everybody north of the Border knows, the Scots are the best behaved fans in
the world. Secondly, although English football supporters have a dreadful
reputation abroad, they are not known for causing trouble at home and certainly
not at Wembley, perhaps because police in England know those who are most
likely to cause trouble and where they might attempt to create the aggro.
q.GRAEME Le Saux's chances of playing in next summer's European Championship
final looked bleak yesterday morning after it was revealed that the Blackburn
full back has been stricken by a triple injury blow. The England defender was
carried off during the 1-0 victory over Middlesbrough on Saturday, having
suffered a broken fibula, dislocated ankle, and a ruptured tendon in his right
leg.

SCOTTISH clubs have given no indication to the SFA that they would want to
follow the initiative of the FA, who yesterday launched a campaign to help
English clubs retrieve some of the pride they feel has been lost in European
club competitions.
If the plan is approved, clubs will have four days clear of domestic fixtures
before European matches and the option of a bye in the two-leg Coca-Cola Cup
second round.
The proposals, which will require FA Premier League and Football League
approval, have been made in response     to complaints from club managers about
shortage of time available for preparations before European matches.
``We must bend over backwards to help our clubs be successful in Europe,'' said
Graham Kelly, the FA chief executive. ``English teams have under-performed in
Europe over the last five seasons.''
However, SFA chief executive Jim Farry pointed out that there had been no
approach from any of the top clubs on this issue. ``We are always receptive to
any ideas that would help our clubs in Europe, but there has been no indication
that this is a problem,'' he said, ``If there is a problem we would have to
refer it to the Scottish League as it is their card that is involved.
``However my own view would be that, if our players wish to imitate the
Italians or others I would rather it was in mimicking their skills than
anything else.''
The English initiative stems from a meeting involving FA officials, coach Terry
Venables, and several club managers. Nottingham Forest are the only survivors
into the new year with Blackburn, Everton, Liverpool, Leeds, and Manchester
United all making early exits.
Managers Joe Royle of Everton, Leeds' Howard Wilkinson, Ray Harford of
Blackburn, United's Alex Ferguson and Forest's Frank Clark all agreed at the
meeting that the time factor was a key issue in the decline of English clubs as
major European forces.
But there could be opposition from TV companies.
q.MANAGER Roy Aitken gave Aberdeen pass marks in his half-term report, but he
warned: You must do better.
He promised the growing Pittodrie support that he would be making more signings
in his aim to build a side to challenge the Old Firm on a regular basis.
He insisted: ``We have come a long way since last season when we were fighting
against relegation.''

ENGLAND legend Sir Bobby Charlton yesterday placed a huge question mark over
Paul Gascoigne's Euro '96 involvement.
Charlton is excited at the prospect of the re-opening of the England-Scotland
fixture at Wembley in next summer's championships. But he displayed concern as
he assessed the player Bobby Robson once tagged ``daft as a brush''.
``If he was fit it would be great, but I worry about his fitness and all the
problems which surround him,'' said Charlton. ``He seems to go from one problem
to another but he is a great player.''
Charlton, meanwhile, can't wait for the game which has captivated the whole
nation.
But he suffered a convenient partial loss of memory when questioned about
Scotland's most famous Wembley win, when a Jim Baxter-inspired side beat
Charlton and company 3-2 in 1967.
``England v Scotland. I think it's brilliant. I'm going to that one definitely
- if I can get a ticket. Maybe if the Scots behave themselves when they come
down, it can be a regular thing.''

WHILE the troops seek out the tammies and banners, song sheets and bagpipes, it
might be a good idea if our team leaders relegate June 15 to the pending tray
and give it some attention around about midnight on June 14. This tactic is
based on a simple assumption, that picking a side and motivating 11 Scots to
beat the English is a relatively straightforward business and needs no
exhaustive preparation.
The hard bit will be to keep the lads on the leash until it is time to let them
head for Wembley, much the same as it is with the tartan army which is already
beginning its vetting of new recruits, as well as welcoming veterans of many a
campaign who wish to re-enlist after fading away in the post-England era.
Therefore, Craig Brown and his cohorts must forget all about dealing with the
Auld Enemy until it becomes necessary, and concentrate on what really matters
in European or World Cup groups, the opening match. While the reinstatement of
the oldest international has taken up our attention, the fact that we must meet
Holland in our first match has been shunted into a siding. Yet that game will
be of far greater importance in terms of Scotland's attempt to get beyond the
initial stage of the tournament for the first time.
It is a tie that the Dutch are already planning for, on the basis that a win
against Scotland will put them in what they would see as a virtually certain
qualifying position. The trick for Scotland would be to get through that game
without losing and then be heading for Wembley with a point in the sack and
England at their mercy.
In all seriousness, though, the fact is that defeat by Holland would make
qualifying for the next stage very difficult indeed, especially as the Swiss
are sure to tackle their three games on a strictly tactical basis. In the end,
perhaps beating England might matter more to the Wembley gang than getting
through to the quarter-finals but, if tartan horizons are to be stretched
beyond the Braveheart boundary, the leaders must take a broader vision.
The task of emerging from the opening tie at Villa Park with at least a point
is enormous, of course, as the Scots take on the favourites for the competition
(incidentally, it is just our luck to be drawn with the hosts and the
favourites, with two to qualify) and, although they were impressive in the
play-off win over the Republic of Ireland, Holland will almost certainly be
even better by the time the finals come around.
The quality of their side is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that there is
a concerted campaign in their media to have Denis Bergkamp dropped from the
squad for England. Although most of us who watched their class act at Anfield
last week were convinced that the Arsenal player contributed considerably
before he was substituted nine mnutes into the second half, the feeling in the
Netherlands was that he should have been taken off earlier.
The former Ajax player is not the flavour of the month back home where they
believe he is not playing well enough to be in the side and, in any case the
Ajax style would be better served by leaving him and Glenn Helder, his Arsenal
team-mate, at home. The pressure is being put on manager Guus Hiddink to call
in one of the Ajax reserve wingers, 18-year-old Kiki Mhsampa or 19-year-old
Nordin Wouter to take over on the right wing and let Marc Overmars assume his
club role on the left.
The argument, which does not meet with much approval in PSV Eindhoven or
Feyenoord circles, is that the purloining of eight of the Ajax side into the
national team against the Irish proved that it is time to go the full hog and
stick more or less completely to the players from that club.
It may seem outlandish to suggest calling in reserves to support the club
format, but we are dealing with something extraordinary here. Bear in mind that
striker Patrick Kluivert, who scored both goals and whose talents left most
British observers breathless, is not always guaranteed his place in the Ajax
team. Nigerian star Kanu is a serious rival for the position who often takes
precedence.
Despite all of this alarming information, history indicates that Scotland might
well do better from the no-chance stall than later in the same week when the
wha's-like-us drumbeats could entice us to march over the cliffs in glorious
failure.

IVORY &amp; Sime has yet to produce conclusive evidence that the major surgery it
has undergone during the past year or so is producing rewards, but there are
signs that the fund management group is turning the corner.
Although its flagship British Assets Trust and sister Investors Capital
investment trust have signalled they are back on track after a revamp, benefits
of the wider shake-up have still to be reflected in the Edinburgh-based
outfit's profit figures.
Ivory &amp; Sime yesterday reported a 13% fall in operating profits to #2.57m for
the six months to end-October, which was largely the result of a sharp decline
in revenue.
Profits were down 5% at #2.95m at the pre-tax level and the group said it
anticipated full-year results would be ``broadly similar'' to last year's
#5.93m.
In spite of this, Ivory &amp; Sime's shares, which slumped to 199p when the fund
management group reported annual results back in July, yesterday added !sp to
232!sp in a generally negative sector.
Still firmly in acquisition mode, it revealed it would be interested in the
recently troubled Dunedin Fund Managers, if Bank of Scotland, Dunedin's
ultimate parent company, and the four investment trusts which own the remaining
49% showed a willingness to sell.
Ivory &amp; Sime claimed a 19% increase in funds under management to #3700m,
although #339m has been added as a result of the acquisitions of the investment
trust-focused Clan Asset Management and development capital manager Baronsmead.
Stripping out the impact of these purchases, the underlying increase in funds
under management was only 8%. When set against the backdrop of strong advances
in the major world stock markets, this increase does not look so spectacular.
However, it is an improvement on last year, when funds tumbled from #3800m to
#3100m.
In terms of revenue, which was down a hefty 10% at #7.41m, Ivory &amp; Sime is
suffering a ``hangover'' from past losses of fund management fee income.
Although profits fell, Ivory &amp; Sime increased its interim dividend by 11% to
2.50p. The group justified the increase in terms of ``substantial progress in
rebuilding recurrent earnings'', as well as its previously-stated intention of
achieving a more balanced relationship between the halfway and final payouts.
It said the final dividend would at least equal last year's 5.25p.

THE Christmas wish expressed by all involved in SABIC - the Glasgow-based
Society for the Advancement of Brain Injured Children, the first centre of its
kind in Scotland - is simple and direct.
They want to build a brand new centre at their location in the former David
Elder Hospital in Govan. It will cost #1.5m. In addition, SABIC has to raise
#61,500 to buy its current building from Greater Glasgow Health Board.
``We don't say ``want''. Because it will happen,'' say Joyce MacIntyre and
Aileen Burges, directors of this registered charity which treats its flow of
young clients from very small babies to teenagers by applying complementary
medicine.
Both have been trained in its procedures at other established centres in the
United States and Europe.
``Our bottom line in treatment is that there is always hope,'' said Joyce
MacIntyre. ``We have never had a complete failure. What we achieve may be very
small or may be very big. But when a young client is stimulated the result is
usually something of benefit.'' She has worked with brain-damaged children for
almost ten years. When she met fellow director Aileen Burges it resulted in
their joint determination to create their Glasgow centre.
``At first we set up a centre in the old Lambhill School,'' said Aileen Burges.
``Then, eventually, we were able to move into health board accomodation in the
old David Elder Hospital. When we moved in it was rundown, worn out, had been
misused by transients, and was in a disgusting state. The first thing we had to
do was clean and paint.''
That was when some of SABIC's small army of supporters and volunteers came to
the rescue. Teams of prison officers and volunteer young offenders set to work
in what was close to a salvage operation within the two hospital wards and
offices that had been acquired. Others began refurbishing the empty building.
Inmates at Shotts Prison constructed many of the items of special equipment
needed for treatment areas. Oil workers on some of the North Sea rigs made
their own contributions, as did many others.
``That ranged from children in some of the local schools making the
all-important ``flash cards'' we needed for our youngsters to an amazing
variety of fund-raising efforts. Prison officers were involved again in a
series of sponsored walks and marathons. One team carried out what they called
The Joggle - a team jog from John O'Groats to Lands End.
``The Govan community, including Govan Rotary Club, also rallied round as soon
as they heard we had moved in at the David Elder. They have been helping ever
since, and now we know they are ready to help again.''
The registered charity SABIC was established in 1989 to promote the development
of brain-injured children. The health board charges only a nominal rent for the
hospital premises and contributes generously towards the centre's bills for
elecricity, gas and security. SABIC hopes to reach a similarly generous deal to
buy the building.
``As yet we have no mainstream Government funding,'' said Joyce MacIntyre.
``Our innovative holistic techniques do not fall within the present remit of
health, education and social services departments. We remain a privately
organised charity.''
Today the centre has a salaried staff of six, plus innumerable volunteers, and
sees about one hundred children a year.
``Some local children come on a day-to-day basis for programmes of treatment
which may last for a few weeks, a few months, a year, or longer. Others from
further afield are evaluated, a programme of therapy is prepared, their parents
are instructed on how to carry it out, and then that treatment can be carried
out at home. They then return here at regular intervals so that they can be
reassessed and their therapy modified as required.''
``We don't use drugs or surgery,'' said Aileen Burges. ``We use natural
medication which may include minerals and vitamins. We exercise the brains of
our young clients.
``No two brain injured children are alike. If a brain has been injured or hurt
then it can forget what to do and we have to re-educate it, which can sometimes
mean re-route it. Our constant aim is to realise our children's full potential
and to maximise it towards progression and an improved quality of life.''
The expense of treatment is met by parents being invited to make a donation of
around one third of its actual cost and the balance being met by money raised
by fund-raising.
``An estimated l3,500 children in Scotland suffer some degree of brain injury.
We attempt to treat the cause of a child's problems rather than the symptoms.
Our therapy is taught to the child's parents and can be carried out at home.
``We believe that the best therapists for the children are their parents.''
Robert MacLeod visits a hospital which offers hope to brain injured children
and their families

WE were sitting in the ministerial conference suite on the fourth floor of Old
St Andrews House in Edinburgh, first thing last Friday morning. Journalists
were heavily outnumbered by the business, economic development, and educational
establishment. Two large numbers flashed on the screen. Nineteen and 24.
No, Michael Forsyth had not decided, as part of his practical devolution drive,
to bring the National Lottery draw to Calton Hill. The two numbers were not the
first of six, but two of many we were asked to absorb as part of an hour-long
presentation on an issue vital to Scotland's economic future.
The numbers 19 and 24 summed up our present predicament. According to the
slide, the UK had slumped, by 1994, to nineteenth place in the world prosperity
league as measured by per capita gross domestic product (at purchasing power
parity). And, in parallel, we had slipped to twenty-fourth place among
economies in the overall skills attainment of our people.
``There can't be any mystery about the link between these two figures,''
insisted our speaker, before going on to elaborate on the dilemma we face. A
higher education system for one third of the population which is world class.
Education and vocational training for the other two-thirds which is
increasingly uncompetitive in global terms. ``We have to close that gap. To
make Scotland more competitive, we must create a world-class skills base,'' he
argued.
Our speaker told us he had taken his message round the country for the past two
and a half years. To 150 events. To more than 9000 people. Some had added their
own thoughts. ``There was unanimous support for our vision,'' he added.
As the big numbers - 19 and 24 - filled the St Andrews House projector screen,
I looked round the room for reaction. As far as I could tell no-one present -
including the Scottish Industry Minister, George Kynoch - so much as blinked in
dissent.
How different it would have been had the speaker presenting us with such
daunting challenges been Gordon Brown, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer and
not Professor John Ward, chairman of ASCETT, the Advisory Scottish Council for
Education and Training Targets, who was there to introduce the organisation's
first annual report.
When, recently, Mr Brown launched another Labour assault on the Government's
economic record with newspaper adverts claiming the UK had slipped from
thirteenth to eighteenth place in the world prosperity league, Ministers
jostled for space on the airwaves to accuse him of talking Britain down. Yet
the Shadow Chancellor was using precisely the same statistic as Professor Ward.
On the Labour analysis, the UK is actually one notch higher up the league.
Yet, between the Government's reaction to that Labour campaign and Mr Kynoch's
welcome, on Friday, for the training targets being set and pursued by Professor
Ward and his colleagues lies a yawning gulf. It is a regrettable fact of
political life in this country that, when parties clash head-on, the message
usually gets buried in the rush to put the boot into the messenger.
Happily, Professor Ward and his council, appointed by the Secretary of State
but described by the Scottish Office as ``independent'', carry no overt
political baggage. So we can all focus on their message. And it is a
challenging one.
In common with countries like the United States, France, and Singapore, we now
have precise and demanding training targets in Scotland up to the year 2000 and
Friday's report was about how far we have progressed towards meeting them. The
picture is decidedly mixed.
Target one is for 85% of young people in Scotland to attain SVQ level two, five
standard grades or equivalent by the year 2000. Last year 72.5% of all young
people aged 18 had made it, down on the 75.3% recorded in 1993, but well ahead
of the 64.2% who made it in 1992.
Professor Ward's council remains convinced that that target is still ``well
within sight''. Its faith rests, in part, on the steadily growing percentage of
15-year-olds who are achieving it. But there are problems. Fifteen-year-old
girls are doing much better than boys at the same age. And some of the most
populous parts of Scotland, including most of the central belt, is still well
adrift of the target.
The second target - that 70% of young people attain SVQ level three, three
Highers or equivalent - is proving more elusive. In 1994, 51.1% of 19-year-olds
had achieved that, but progress is currently running at just over half the rate
needed to hit the year 2000 target.
Females are again doing better than males on the academic route to this target.
But they are underperforming on the vocational route. There are still,
according to the council, too many families who would rather their children
become unemployed doctors, lawyers, or accountants, than opt for careers
elsewhere in business. Again Glasgow and the rest of the central belt is well
adrift.
On target three - that 60% of the entire workforce will be qualified to SVQ
level three, three Highers or equivalent by the year 2000 - progress is
officially described as ``abysmal''. The present Scottish level of 47% is
virtually unchanged in the past three years. To get to 60% by the year 2000
means transforming the skills of more than 250,000 Scottish workers. And, given
the low levels of participation in further and higher education courses by
workers over the age of 24, it is hard to see how the gap can be bridged.
ASCETT takes modest comfort from the fact that, on all three targets, Scotland
is currently ahead of other parts of the United Kingdom. But we are, as
Professor Ward made very clear on Friday, well adrift of international rivals,
like Singapore. No longer, he warned us, can we dismiss an economy like
Singapore's as a ``sweatshop''. Like India's growing expertise in software
engineering, it presents economies like ours with a double whammy - on both
costs and skills.
Thanks to the work of Professor Ward and his colleagues we have agreed training
targets that can help to close the gap. Is it impossible, in the
confrontational atmosphere which still characterises British politics in the
dog days of this millennium, to reach some limited consensus on how to
accelerate progress towards them?

<HEADLINE>Veteran striker clings to his boyish dreams A Wembley miracle is injured McCoist's aim</HEADLINE>

ALLY McCoist was back on the treatment table yesterday and won't play for
Rangers in tonight's satellite television match against Motherwell at Fir Park.
If the Ibrox club didn't have their own pressing concerns they could have been
asked to look after their striker and keep him safe and well until next June
when Scotland play England at Wembley in the European Championship finals.
The boyish charm remains intact but he is no waif. In fact, the boy McCoist is
33 and you always know a player is beginning to feel the ravages of time when
his memories outnumber the prospects ahead.
McCoist has reached the point where it is foolish to pretend. He knows his days
at the top are numbered and is aware also that other, younger players sense
they have a chance to nudge him to one side.
He is especially under threat in the international arena where Duncan Ferguson,
Eoin Jess, and Scott Booth are staking strong claims for inclusion in the team
which will carry the nation's hopes into next summer's finals, but even if the
old joints are beginning to ache a little more with each year McCoist is
planning one final outrage.
Football prevents most of us from growing up fully and like all boys with
dreams McCoist wants to play at Wembley and he wants to score the winning goal
against the English. The difference between him and the rest of us is that if
anyone could go down into the enemy's camp and strike a blow it is him.
The English may scoff at the very notion, but others have written Scotland and
McCoist off in the past and suffered as a consequence. McCoist specialises in
the impossible. He bridges the gap between fantasy and reality. His desire to
do something special at Wembley, for Scotland and the fans, but also for
himself will, he believes, help drive him through this season.
That, of course, is also good news for Rangers who have Celtic breathing down
their necks for the first time in years and although McCoist can't play at Fir
Park tonight his calf muscle injury is not serious and he will be able to play
over the festive period. Rangers also will be without Stuart McCall (calf),
Alex Cleland (hamstring), and Gary Bollan (knee) and the suspended pair, Paul
Gascoigne and Oleg Salenko and McCoist trusts those still standing to restore a
four-point gap between them and Celtic.
Winning the premier division championship for the eighth consecutive time is
the priority at Ibrox and McCoist said: ``A wonderful incentive has been put in
front of every Scot who wants to take part in the European Championship finals
and I must play as well as I can between now and the end of the season.
``I have to score as many goals as I can and stay healthy and if I can do all
of these things then Rangers would gain the first benefit. Then, unless I can
defy medical science, the European finals and Wembley would be my international
swan song.''
He has played at Wembley once before, but doesn't care to dwell on the
experience. It was in 1988 and England's Peter Beardsley scored the only goal
of the match. McCoist didn't play well and was taken off to make way for Kevin
Gallacher.
``First, Beardsley's goal was offside and as for the rest just let's say I
wasn't at my influential best,'' McCoist said. ``Before that I was at Wembley
as a supporter, but I want to go back one more time and get it right.
``Consider it all. England in their own backyard, lots of good players and fans
who all think they will win the championship. They believe the draw has been
kind to them because they have to play us and Switzerland. All we've got to do
is go down there and stuff them. Would that not be a wonderful experience?''
Already barbs have been exchanged within the Ibrox dressing room where there is
a cosmopolitan feel. ``Gascoigne walked in yesterday morning,'' McCoist said,
``and he pronounced himself delighted with the draw. `But,' he added, `I'm just
a bit worried . . . about Switzerland.'
``However, we'll get him soon enough. We'll remind him what we are all about up
here.''
There is a concern that too few tickets will be allocated to Scottish fans, but
McCoist, whose only other appearance against England was in the 2-0 defeat at
Hampden in 1989, scoffs at the suggestion of Scotland at Wembley without a
decent support. ``Wembley without Scots? If it is anything like a Wembley of
old we won't have to worry about the fans. They'll get there,'' he said.
Rangers will probably have to rely on Brian Laudrup and Gordon Durie - another
who has hopes of playing for Scotland next summer - up front tonight and Walter
Smith pointed out: ``Motherwell    find themselves in a strange position after
having been challengers for the title in recent years, but this will still be a
hard game for us. They'll be looking to get themselves a lift from this match.''
The manager added that Alexei Mikhailichenko, who scored three times in the
reserve match against Motherwell on Saturday, could start the match.

Widows plans
to stay mutual
TOP UK life office Scottish Widows said yesterday that, unlike some
competitors, it had no plans to give up its mutual status in the foreseeable
future.
The Edinburgh-based company said it would not be travelling down what it
considered a short-termist, finance-raising plc path, where policyholders were
replaced by shareholders.
Newton Scott, the company's marketing director, said: ``Demutualisation does
not represent part of our plans. We are financially one of the strongest life
companies in the UK and, therefore, have ample capital for our growth and
expansion ambitions.''
Hewden buys
HEWDEN-STUART, the Glasgow-based plant hire company, has acquired WH Price, a
Birmingham-based power tool hire firm with 14 outlets in the west Midlands, for
#5.6m. Hewden Stuart will keep the plant hire business of WH Price which
employs 122 staff, but the sales division, which employs a further 20, is being
sold on to a group of former directors. The price of this secondary deal was
not disclosed, but it is understood to be in the region of #600,000.
Optimum boost
IVORY &amp; Sime's Optimum Income Trust outperformed its benchmark All-Share Index
during the six months to end-November and delivered an inflation-beating
increase in dividend. After adjusting for the entitlement of zero-dividend
Preference shareholders, the #69m fund's net asset value rose 12.0% to 109.96p.
The All-Share advanced 10.4%. A second interim dividend of 2.15p takes the
first-half payout to 4.30p, up 10.3%. The UK trust's earnings per share slipped
from 5.79p to 4.03p.
Merger cleared
LLOYDS Bank and TSB Group yesterday cleared the final hurdle before their
planned merger next week. The High Court sanctioned the deal after approving
the terms which will involve Lloyds Bank's shares being replaced with shares in
the new Lloyds TSB group. The merger is due to take effect on December 28.
Hydro misses out
US company Mission Energy yesterday claimed victory in the three-way battle for
First Hydro, the pumped storage unit of National Grid. The announcement by
Mission, made in Irvine, California, infers that Perth-based Scottish
Hydro-Electric, the only UK bidder, has lost out. Mission said it would release
financial details when the result of the sale is formally announced on Friday.
First Hydro had been expected to fetch between #400m and #600m.
Amicable coup
IAN Beattie, chief investment manager with Scottish Life, is moving to Scottish
Amicable, in what the Glasgow-based life assurance company yesterday described
as ``a real coup''. Mr Beattie will join Scottish Amicable in mid-January, when
he will have specific responsibility for international equities. Gary Mairs,
company marketing director on the investment management side, said he would
replace Stewart Gilchrist who had been promoted to chief investment officer.
Guru moves
THE leading Scottish advertising guru responsible for many award-winning
campaigns such as Tennent's Lager and Kwik-Fit has been dramatically poached by
a rival firm. Jim Downie is moving from his post as group creative director
with The Leith Agency to the same post at arch rival Faulds Advertising.

SHARE markets were in retreat yesterday, leading to a 46.5-point fall in the
FTSE-100 index to 3596.1, its biggest since early October. The index had
followed an initial drop on Wall Street where the continued impasse over the US
Budget has raised fears that the Federal Open Market Committee will not cut
interest rates today as had been widely expected.
Meanwhile, at home, the Treasury was insisting Government borrowing was still
on target as the City sought to play down any significance in the November
public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) which, at #3711m, was almost #1000m
above market projections and compared with #3638m for the same time last year.
With the October figure revised from a repayment of #1300m to #1000m, it brings
the cumulative total for the first eight months of the financial year to
#22.8bn against #23.2m (#27bn excluding privatisation proceeds) in 1994.
In his Budget, the Chancellor forecast a PSBR of #29bn for the year, revised
upwards from #23.6bn. However, most analysts were suggesting that despite the
November outcome, it would be premature to assume the Chancellor's target would
be exceeded.
A Treasury spokeswoman said the November PSBR figure was consistent with the
Government's forecast for the 1995-96 financial year. She said spending in the
year to date was only 3.4% up from last year, compared with the Budget forecast
of 3.8%. There were also #3000m of privatisation proceeds yet to be received -
they were negligible last month - and January is a big tax month.
The figures, though, were disappointing in relation to market estimates and
there was bound to be some speculation that the Budget projection would prove
to be too little. Most of the blame can be put on higher Government spending in
the month, which showed a #1250m increase compared with November 1994.
Securities house James Capel's Adam Cole said, taking the data for the first
eight months at face value, the improvement in the PSBR from last year
suggested a full-year outcome of around #33bn after allowing for differences in
privatisation proceeds.
But he said that with the major uncertainties of January corporation tax
proceeds and March spending remaining, the Treasury projections were still
achievable. The details of the figures for the first eight months show both
receipts and expenditure under-shooting the Treasury forecasts slightly.
Central government receipts are up by 9.1% compared with a forecast of 9.6% for
the year as a whole.
A significant improvement in the public finances in the remainder of the year
was likely, Mr Cole said. And he remained of the view that by 1996-97, Treasury
forecasts were over-cautious and PSBR was likely to come in better than
expected, paving the way for tax cuts next year.
Goldman Sachs' David Walton also considered there was no reason to doubt the
Treasury's forecast at this stage as central Government borrowing remained
broadly on track. He forecasted a PSBR of #28.3bn in 1995-96 falling to #24.8bn
in 1996-97.
Meanwhile, neither the gilts nor foreign exchange markets showed much interest
in or reaction to the November figures.

FOR 30 years - all my life, indeed - she has been behind bars. But the face of
Myra Hindley has become an icon of our age. The tousled beehive, the sandbagged
eyes, the thin mean mouth; this, thanks to a thousand tabloid subs, is The Face
of Evil. Thus it is burned on our brains.
Rosemary West's lumpy face will never dethrone that image. Myra Hindley was
young. This woman was nearly pretty. This woman, and her accomplice, Ian Brady,
abducted small children; not only that, but they murdered them, and before they
murdered them they degraded them and tortured them, even tape-recording the
sobs and pleas of the little things, and yelling with laughter as they did so.
A year or two earlier, and Myra Hindley might have been hanged. Instead she was
incarcerated for life, with Brady; he, manifestly several coupons short of a
pop-up toaster, was subsequently removed to a secure mental hospital and is
today quite forgotten. Myra Hindley has never been forgotten. That photograph
is one of the most recognisable in our archives. That infamy puts her way up
there with Sawney Bean and the Black Douglas. To this day, mention of her name
provokes violent debate.
No, she is not forgotten, and she herself has made sure of it. Lord Longford,
of course, famously visits her. For many years he has protested that she is a
changed woman, no menace to anybody, and what a cruelty it is to keep her
wasting behind prison walls. Now and again there have been tales of lesbian
affairs. One, with a prison officer, led to an escape plot.
Nine years ago, Hindley suddenly decided she remembered a great deal more than
she had previously admitted, of where the crimes happened and where their small
victims were buried. So a hunt was launched, on Saddleworth Moor, and she
herself got a day-pass or two, under heavy guard, to direct diggers and dogs.
One wee body was recovered. The press, of course, were kept well away; the best
they won was a helicopter shot. Apart from one or two bad colour snapshots
taken by other inmates since released, we have little idea of how she looks
today.
So the image abides. The Moors murderess. The Face of Evil.
Well, for 30 years poor Myra Hindley has strove for release - toiled, day and
night, to be free - and has resorted to every means to convince the Home
Secretary and society at large that she is a changed person, a reformed
character, full of liberal intent and worthy guilt. And now she has done what
well-intended guilty liberals do best; she has written for the Guardian. A
letter, published yesterday, oozing penitence. No fewer than 5000 words.
Hindley declares she now realises that she was ``corrupt, wicked, and evil . .
. I wasn't mad, so I must have been bad. I take full responsibility for the
part I played and I will not attempt to justify the unjustifiable''. She admits
that, really, she was more to blame than Brady; she played the vital role of
procuring the children, who were more willing to go with a strange woman.
The effect of this, however, is rather spoiled when Hindley insists that, but
for Brady, she would never have hurt anyone. ``If we had not met, there would
have been no murders at all, no crimes. I would probably have got married, had
children, would now be a grandmother.''
Her resentment of the media is palpable. Primly, Hindley objects to being
labelled an ``evil monster''. And she has little time for popular opinion.
``The truth is that most people will not accept that people like me change.''
Immediate reaction to Myra's musings has been predictable. Her lawyer, Andrew
McCooey, says she has ``come to terms'' with the fact that she will never be
released; she wants merely to ``put the record straight''. Moors murders
detective, Peter Topping, says the letter is a plain bid for parole. And Winnie
Johnson - mother of one of the murdered children - has no doubts at all.
Hindley is trying to make people feel sorry for her. She should ``rot in prison
for the rest of her life.''
What should we make of this, at a time of year when we traditionally think of
God's Christ, of redemption, of peace and goodwill?
Myra Hindley's case does invite some sympathy. There is little doubt she has
suffered much infamy and loathing on account of her sex. It is because of these
abominable crimes so violated our concepts of womanhood, of maternity, that her
part in them is recalled with particular, if perhaps irrational, horror.
She may well be right, too, in declaring that only her fatal association with
Brady made her a murderess. The history of homicides abounds with couples whose
atrocities arose from some deadly chemistry of association.
Yet Hindley must never be released.
For one, the day she walks free she is a dead woman. Relatives of her victims
have sworn for many a year, that they would kill her with their bare hands. And
there are plenty nutters and vigilantes to save them the trouble.
For another, murder is a particularly vile crime. Its work is irreversible, its
arrogance blasphemous, its consequences resounding. And these murders were
particularly ghastly.
Has Hindley changed? She is older, I dare say, wiser. She is genuinely appalled
by what she once was and what she once did. But remorse is not repentance.
There is no real hint here of a saving change. Ego lies behind murder; ego
behind all crime and sin. Ego still thrives here. Myra Hindley's quest for
freedom - for publicity - for a further, hysterical, self-validating bid to
show the world she is still alive - comes first of all. Never mind the
incalculable distress caused to the families of her victims. Never mind the
further reminder to us of an atrocity we would rather forget. Is the festive
season - perhaps the worst time of all for those who have buried a child - the
better, for those ruined people, when the killer pops up in the press and
pleads for her character?
I am sorry, indeed, that Myra Hindley did not lead a normal life; that she is
not, today, a mother and grandmother. But she had the chance once, a generation
ago, as a grown young woman. Lesley Anne Downey never had that chance. And,
this Christmastide, for the thirtieth time and more, a broken woman will hear
the cold wind, and wonder where her little Keith is buried.

<HEADLINE>Anger at carry-over of European suspensions Dutch challenge UEFA to give skipper clean sheet</HEADLINE>

WHILE they claim to be delighted with the European Championship draw which pits
them against Scotland and England, the Dutch are so furious at the suspension
of their captain, Danny Blind, from the opening game against the Scots, that
they are seeking support throughout Europe to have his ban rescinded.
The Dutch anger is based on three counts. First, the UEFA decision to carry
over suspensions from the qualifying round is unfair; secondly that Blind was a
victim of mistaken identity when he suffered his second booking of the
tournament in the play-off against the Republic of Ireland; thirdly, that it is
unjust that England, as hosts, should go into the finals with a clean sheet
while others who had to qualify are put at a disadvantage.
The fact that 34-year-old Blind, the oldest and most experienced player in the
Dutch squad, will be absent against Craig Brown's team may be good news for
Scotland, but the details of the system that bring this about seem a little
bizarre.
UEFA's rule is that all yellow cards will be deleted when the finals begin, but
any pending suspensions will be imposed. In Blind's case, his two yellow cards
ensured that he had to miss the next European game, which is in the finals
against Scotland.
If he had not been booked against the Irish, his earlier yellow card would have
been removed from his record.
The UEFA argument is that suspensions must be served, and perhaps there is no
other way to apply the rule, but the broader Dutch case is difficult to oppose.
Their FA is adamant that England have a big enough advantage in playing all
their matches on their home park, Wembley, without having had to qualify, and,
therefore, it is unfair to ask all the other countries to start off the finals
with any suspensions, simply because they were unlucky enough to have to
qualify.
It is an argument that the Dutch want to put forward with the backing of as
many fellow qualifying countries as possible and the chances are they will get
full support from many, particularly those, like Germany, who have suspensions
hanging over their players, too.
SFA chief executive Jim Farry said that he didn't think it would be right to
condone indiscipline, but added: ``The matter is on the agenda for the meeting
between all the finalists in London on February 21. Craig Brown and I will be
at that meeting, and when the discussion is over a straw poll will be taken.
``That will be brought to the UEFA Committee, who will then make a decision
which is not necessarily in keeping with the poll.''
UEFA are difficult to shift on these matters and it looks certain that Blind,
who, the Dutch claim, was booked for a foul committed by Ronald de Boer at
Anfield, will be in the stand when his team take on the Scots.
The Dutch captain is confident that, whatever happens, Holland will go through
to the finals. ``The draw is very good for us,'' he said, ``because we have
shown we can overcome the British style of football tactically. Scotland and
England play opportunist football and technically this suits our game. The
Swiss have to be watched because they will play tactically for the results they
need to get through.
``The tournament will really begin in the quarter finals and I am confident we
will be there.''
Holland manager Guus Hiddink, who played a cautious game in Birmingham after
the draw was made, was more forthcoming at home. ``The opening game against
Scotland is an excellent start for us and although Scotland will play hard, it
is better than taking on such as Spain or Germany to begin with.''
The theory has already being put forward that the last game of the group,
between the Dutch and English, could be played with less than frantic
application if it suits both countries, but Hiddink does not believe it will be
the case. ``The atmosphere at Wembley would not allow the game to be played at
a sedate pace. It will be as competitive as ever.''
The Dutch will try to arrange a game with the Republic of Ireland as part of
their preparation for the finals. Hiddink sees that as an ideal way of
reminding his players of the British way of playing.
Scotland are 10-1 in the latest Ladbrokes' list to win their group and, if that
does not appeal, maybe you would prefer 50-1 against them winning the
championship altogether. Then against, maybe not. The Dutch are odds on, 8-11,
to win the section with England at 13-8 and Switzerland at 12-1.

PLANS for reconstruction of the Scottish League last night looked doomed to
failure following a weekend meeting of second and third division clubs in
Stirling.
The clubs from the bottom two divisions have indicated that they want to stay
loyal to the sponsors in Scottish football, and that could mean them voting
against league reconstruction changes this season.
Certainly that message will be carried by their representatives when they
attend Thursday's meeting of the League Management Committee when a proposal by
first division clubs for a premier division of 16 clubs is put forward.
There were also indications last night that Rangers were reluctant to support a
mid-season change, while last week Celtic chairman Fergus McCann stated that he
was against the change suggested by the first division clubs.
An insider who attended Sunday's meeting said last night: ``The feeling was
that sponsors put a lot of money into the game and must be considered. The very
least we can do is to ask them for their views.
``We cannot simply change things in mid-contract without finding out whether
the sponsors would want to stay with a new set-up. There was certainly a
reluctance by the clubs to commit themselves to supporting change at this stage.
``In addition, a number of clubs expressed reservations that they should be put
into two leagues of 12, which would mean playing each other three times a
season.''
No vote was taken at the meeting, but the second and third division
representatives on the Scottish league management committee, Jim Baxter (East
Fife), John Smith (Stirling Albion) and Pat Lawlor (Alloa), were instructed to
take that message to Thursday's meeting.
q.TOM Callaghan could get the chance of chasing promotion with Dunfermline,
thanks to buying his own transfer.
Callaghan was unhappy with second division Stranraer and was released last
week, but now the experienced midfielder is training with the first division
leaders and will play tonight in their reserve match at Berwick.

THERE is always a danger that schools become paralysed, staring mindlessly into
the headlamps of statistics. Yet there is growing evidence of schools using
their attendance figures as a starting point to promote change.
St Fergus Primary in Ferguslie is a case in point, where the attendance rate
has moved increasingly into the 90%-plus area in the last few years. Figures
tell only part of the story, however, and in line with the developmental
approach to HMI Audit Unit, the Scottish Initiative on Attendance and Absence
has been established.
Despite any concerns about figures, attendance is an issue which schools
clearly see as relevant and worth addressing. We received more than 400
requests to attend the Audit Unit national conference last month when Raymond
Robertson, Scottish Office Minister for Education, launched the initiative.
Such has been the level of interest that two follow-up events are being
organised.
I have found in the last three months a genuine spirit of collaboration in
addressing the issue from within and without the education service. This has
been made possible by the breadth of good practice currently operating in
Scottish schools.
A consequence of placing attendance in the context of effective schooling is
that it affords the opportunity for schools to get underneath the statistics
and reflect on how best to promote attendance, not simply catch truants. This
contrasts markedly with an earlier attempt at addressing this issue.
The report by Professor Pack in 1977 linked truancy with indiscipline and was
targeted at one end of the attendance continuum. There would be a danger,
however, in assuming that, simply by designing a more appropriate curriculum,
engaging with parents and making links with the community, schools could
transform their attendance figures.
These are all central to almost every development within a school. The bridge
to improvement starts with schools setting realistic targets and this requires
a dialogue between staff, pupils, and parents. For some schools this may result
in targeting those pupils at the margin - the floating voters whose decision to
attend or not will have crucial impact on the school returns.
In other cases, where the support of other agencies or projects can be
available, there can be a commitment to target the persistent truants. We know
there is no identikit picture of a truant and a broad approach is required.
We do not yet have clear enough data on the way in which learning difficulties
lead to attendance and discipline difficulties, but increasingly the evidence
from young people is that the learning experience of school needs to be
engaging. It is not simply about a caring approach.
This focus on effective learning is significant because although tables may
distinguish between authorised and unauthorised absences, the most recent
research from the Scottish Council for Research in Education indicates that
both have a similar effect on attainment. This is a message which all of us
have to take on board.
Parents also have to be part of this. Earlier this month in Edinburgh, in
collaboration with Judith Gillespie from the Scottish Parent Teacher Council,
we ran the first of a series of meetings for parents to talk about improving
attendance.
They told us that they wanted clear guidance on what the school expected of
them and specific information on what they could do to help. They were
definitely not neutral on the issue.
The meeting also helped to challenge the view that attendance is a matter of
concern only in working-class areas. Middle-class parents present also
expressed concerns about their children missing the occasional class or day.
The meeting also exposed the trap parents get into of condoning absence through
wishing to support their child.
Parents and teachers have common concerns and frustrations. We often forget
that many of us emerged from an education system where schooling provided a
useful, if rather crude, means of sorting young people into an appropriate slot
in the job market. That cosy arrangement no longer holds true and the
relationship between home and school has been made increasingly more tense as a
consequence.
In the past, where attendance and behaviour were bad, we often blamed the
influence of the home. Where attendance and behaviour were good, however, we
assumed it was because we delivered a curriculum suitable to the needs of the
individual pupil. There is a value in sharing common concerns rather than
playing pass the parcel with our frustrations.
School boards already play an important part through the membership of
attendance councils, but they could take a more direct role in maintaining the
issue within a school. I have been surprised at how few boards know the
attendance figures for their school.
This is where our Scottish initiative can help, through raising awareness of
the issue. Management teams need all the support they can get to address this
issue and boards have a statutory duty under Section 12 of the 1988 Act to
promote contact between the school, parents and the community.
A recent meeting organised by the Scottish School Board Association indicated
that board members were extremely interested in the issue - and on attending
training to know best how to help.
Statistics in themselves do not change anything. Howeer, schools across
Scotland will be invited shortly to participate in a network designed to
identify the different pathways leading to improved attendance and achievement.
This will build on a national data base of good practice currently being
developed. The new local authorities have a central part to play in this. Once
there is greater consistency of practice in what is recognised as authorised
and unauthorised absence, the focus will be on what works.

Absence, set up by the HMI Audit Unit and the Quality In Education centre at

figures continue to make waves in Scotland's schools, Cameron Munro

SCOTLAND'S success in qualifying for the Euopean Championship finals in England
next summer has raised the image of our game abroad.
While club sides continue to drop out of continental competitions at the early
stages, the national side, even though it remains largely unsung at home, has
impressed enough of the major countries abroad to make attempts to organise
glamour warm-up games prior to the finals an easy matter for the SFA.
Suddenly, we are in demand as the association's Chief Executive, Jim Farry,
discovered at the two draws - World Cup as well as the European one - he
attended over the past week.
While European champions Denmark are already set to play the Scots in
Copenhagen in April, there are other dates team manager Craig Brown wants to
see filled.
There is one in March, for example, and Italy, Germany and France are all keen
to play the Scottish side then. Indeed, before Sunday's draw placed us in the
same group, Holland, too, had expressed interest in a game.
As Farry pointed out:``We are talking here about the major footballing powers
in Europe, and they are all keen to play us either in Glasgow or in their own
countries.
``This is something we will be sitting down to talk to Craig Brown about. Some
plans have already been put in place. We are going to Denmark, of course, and
we are also going to the United states for two games there just a few weeks
before we go to England.
``What we want to do is discuss with Craig just how many matches he will want
to play as he tries to keep the squad in action. It looks as if we will have
the cream of European football to call on and that says something, I think,
about how people are looking at our game.''
Farry's assessment is accurate. We may not be among the favourites for the
European Championships, but we are going south to face the best 16 nations from
the Continent and just to be among them has added to the reputation of Brown's
side.
And that growing admiration encourages Farry in his hope that some time in the
future, Scotland will be able to host the finals of the European Championships.
The next finals are being staged jointly by Belgium and Holland, and this gave
Farry the idea of trying a joint approach to putting on the finals.
He explained: ``When I saw what the Belgians and the Dutch were doing, it
struck me as an idea which we should examine for ourselves and towards that
end, I have held preliminary talks with both the Northern Irish and the Welsh
associations,
``I don't see us having any chance before 2008. The year 2000 has been arranged
and the following finals would be too close to those in England next year.
Anyhow, by that time, we would have Hampden and Celtic Park completed, Ibrox is
already looked on as a possible European venue, and we could also use
Murrayfield. Again I have spoken to the Scottish Rugby Union about this and
they are enthusiastic. For smaller matches, we also have Pittodrie and
Tynecastle, or Easter Road could be used.''
Farry continues to be optimistic that the number of tickets for the Wembley
clash with England will be increased from the initial allocation of just 7000.
He warns that he does not expect a huge rise in the allocation but after his
talks with the tournament organisers, he is convinced that a figure somewhere
between 10,000 and 15,000 is the likeliest number.
In the meantime the SFA offices in Glasgow were swamped by applications to join
the Travel Club. The membership before the draw was a little more 5000 but it
will soar over the next few weeks.
The SFA policy is to supply match tickets to Travel Club members, and that will
apply to all three games in the European finals.

Arbroath 0, Stenhousemuir 1
'MUIR earned a second-round Scottish Cup meeting with East Stirlingshire on
January 6.
John McAulay was a home hero when he cleared a Gareth Hutchison shot off the
line.
Near the break the Warriors had the ball in the net when Paul Hunter headed
home a knock-down from Mathieson but he was judged offside.
After the restart a magnificent save by Craig Hinchcliffe denied Ian Little.
But the Warriors broke through in 70 minutes. An Armstrong corner was cleverly
nodded down by Neil Aitken and Mathieson hooked the ball into the net.
Arbroath almost equalised six minutes later when John Ward's header was cleared
off the line by Adrian Sprott.

SPORT can damage your career, but enlightened academic institutions can help
salvage and even promote it - that was the message last night as Edinburgh's
Telford College became the second pilot performance centre opened as part of
the Scottish Sport - World Class programme.
Launched earlier this year by the Scottish Sports Council, the project already
has a centre at Edinburgh University. The opening of the second was attended by
SRU coach Roy Laidlaw, players from Hearts, and members of the Scottish rugby,
football, badminton, and skiing age-group squads who will receive coaching and
career development support.
One member of the ski team, who suffers from dyslexia, has already achieved one
Higher, and is working towards a Higher National in sport coaching, while 10
Tynecastle players are studying for Highers or coaching qualifications.
Andrew Hunter and Andrew Wilson, of the national age-group rugby squad, and
Scottish junior badminton No.1 Katherine Graham are among those at the college.
``Heavy pressure to achieve sport and academic standards by the age of 18 often
leads to compromise academically,'' said Maggie Gardner of the college's sports
and leisure studies department. ``More flexible assessment, and extending
courses, can provide opportunities which might otherwise be denied.''

WITH only one week left to play in the NFL regular season, 13 teams are chasing
five remaining berths in the post-season play-offs, with two divisional titles
still up for grabs.
Buffalo Bills (10-5) clinched their sixth AFC East title in eight years with a
23-20 win over the Miami Dolphins (8-7) when linebacker Steve White intercepted
Dan Marino late on to set up Steve Christie's winning 25-yard field goal.
The Dolphins can now only be sure of a play-off berth if they win and either
Indianapolis Colts or San Diego Chargers lose next week. The Chargers (8-7)
improved their post-season hopes by edging out the Colts (8-7) 27-24 when John
Carney kicked a 43-yard field goal with three seconds remaining.
Meanwhile, at an emotion-filled Municipal Stadium, the Browns played their
final game in Cleveland, defeating AFC Central rivals Cincinnati Bengals 26-10.
The Cleveland fans, who will lose their team when owner Art Modell ships them
to Baltimore at the end of the season, were subdued until the final two
minutes, when sections of the crowd began to throw seats on to the field.
And in Houston, Steve McNair threw for 198 yards and a TD to lift the Oilers to
a 23-6 victory over the New York Jets in what will probably be their final home
game, after owner Bud Adams agreed a $20m deal to move the team to Nashville,
Tennessee, next year.
In Kansas City, the Chiefs (12-3) held on by 20-17 against the Denver Broncos
(7-8).
In the NFC, Green Bay Packers (10-5) clinched a play-off berth by defeating New
Orleans Saints 34-23. Brett Favre passed for four TDs in the first half. The
Packers can win the Central division next week by beating Pittsburgh, or if
Detroit Lions lose to Tampa Bay.
Chicago Bears (8-7) also are still in the Central play-off hunt after their
31-10 victory over Tampa Bay in which rookie running back Salaam Rashaan rushed
for 134 yards and three touchdowns.
In the NFC West, Carolina Panthers (7-8) beat the Atlanta Falcons (8-7) 21-17,
handing the title to San Francisco (10-4).
Philadelphia Eagles (10-5) clinched a play-off berth and moved closer to Dallas
in the NFC East with a 21-20 come-from-behind victory over Arizona Cardinals.
Quarterback Rodney Peete threw two touchdown passes to bring the Eagles back
from a 17-point deficit. It was the Eagles' second straight comeback victory -
last week they had been 11 points down to Dallas.
The Cowboys (11-4) edged out the lowly New York Giants (5-10) when kicker Chris
Boniol booted a 35-yard last-play field goal, his fifth of the day, for a 21-20
win.
Oakland would have secured a play-off spot by winning Sunday night's late game
with Seattle, but the resurgent Seahawks won it 44-10. Results:
Saturday: Pittsburgh 41, New England 27; Green Bay 34, New Orelans 23.Sunday:
Detroit 44, Jacksonville 0; Buffalo 23, Miami 20; Cleveland 26, Cincinnati 10;
Houston 23, New York Jets 6; Carolina 21, Atlanta 17; Philadelphia 21, Arizona
20; Chicago 31, Tampa Bay 10; Washington 35, St Louis 23; San Diego 27,
Indianapolis 24; Dallas 21, New York Giants 20; Kansas City 20, Denver 17;
Oakland 10, Seattle 44.
Standings of play-off contenders (teams in bold have clinched berths): AFC.
East - Buffalo 10-5; Indianapolis 8-7; Miami 8-7. Central - Pittsburgh 11-4.
West - Kansas City 12-3; Oakland 8-7; San Diego 8-7; Seattle 8-7; Denver 7-8.
NFC. East - Dallas 11-4; Philadelphia 10-5. Central - Green Bay 10-5; Detroit

THE grasping antics of Colin Jackson and Linford Christie, Britain's two
highest-profile male athletes, at this year's AAA Championships, have been
instrumental in depriving the sport of the backer of its two biggest meetings.
Though KP Foods' marketing director said yesterday they had been ``pleased with
their partnership,'' they will not renew a #2m two-year deal.
Christie and Jackson, locked in an appearance-money row, refused to run in the
company's grand-prix event, the first prize-money meeting in UK athletics with
a #100,000 purse, then a week later made a mockery of the AAAs. Christie failed
to survive the 100m heats while Jackson withdrew after qualifying, pleading
injury, yet was fit enough to race in Italy the next day.
The British Athletic Federation's executive chairman, Peter Radford, confirmed
that sponsors and TV had been badly let down.
Though a new backer, to be announced next month, will bring some security, the
sport will shortly announce a substantial loss for the year.
q A TOTAL of 91 athletes will comprise a new Edinburgh District Athletics
Performance squad, at under-20, 17, 15, and 13-year-old levels. Included among
several offspring of illustrious parents are the daughters of former
Commonwealth medallist Moira Walls.

DR SIMON Bowen (above), specialist potato agronomist with the Scottish
Agricultural College, has been appointed field services manager with Anglian
Produce, the parent company of Perth-based Pseedco.
He will oversee a team of 14 agronomists who work with end users. His
responsibilities will include hi-tech specificiation areas covering 108
different niche markets, from potatoes for baking through to the baby ones
favoured for punnet use.
In his new role, Dr Bowen will combine his understanding of the Scottish seed
industry with the immediate requirements of English ware growers. ``His great
value to us will be as an informed liaison between the two ends of the market
at two ends of the country,'' said Alistair Redpath of Pseedco.
Dr Bowen is a member of the Scottish Seed Potato Consultative Panel and of the
National Farmers' Union potato farm assurance working group. He is also a
member of the European Association of Potato Research.

RUSSIA has travelled a long way on the road to democracy and has celebrated her
freedom by awarding electoral favours to the Communists and extreme
nationalists. The result of the election to the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, has been received with calm acceptance within Russia and throughout
the international community. There are two reasons for this quietude which help
to explain why even those with most reason to be alarmed appear tranquil, if
only for the moment. The first is the most obvious; despite the overheated
rhetoric and downright silliness which accompanied much of the campaigning for
the Duma, all those concerned know perfectly well that the parliamentary
election is a mere curtain-raiser for the real contest which will erupt with
the presidential elections which are due to be held next June. We will return
to that subject in a moment, but it is worth remembering that the other
sub-text to the elections to the Duma lies in the fact that the Russian
parliament is a feeble creature, most notable until now for a rather fiery
nuisance value which is rarely capable of being translated into real mischief.
The reason for this lies in the Russian constitution which established a
toothless parliament which has limited powers to intervene in the actions of
the government. Real power lies with the presidency which is far-and-away the
most powerful in Europe. The Communist leader, Mr Gennady Zyuganov, is fond of
saying that the Russian presidency is more powerful than the Russian Tsar, the
Soviet General-Secretary and the Egyptian Pharaoh all rolled together. This is
not strictly true, but all of the main levers of economic power lie with the
President who can also veto any parliamentary legislation of which he
disapproves. If the President becomes seriously disenchanted with the
parliament he can simply rule by decree, which is the path chosen by Mr Yeltsin
for most of the past two years. Only when two-thirds of the Duma get together
(and even more unlikely, vote together) is the President in trouble. Mr Yeltsin
and his associates will be watching closely to see how the arithmetic of the
new Duma works out, but his ability to distribute favours to Duma members, and
the fractious behaviour of Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the extreme nationalists,
means that the government will probably survive. Nevertheless there is a
potential for tension over the next few months which should not allow
complacency. It is also important to ask how the Communists and the
nationalists have managed to make such an impact with the voters. On an
important level the simple fact that the government is unpopular with the
people, and that Russians have been able to register their disapproval, is a
sign that Russian democracy is working. Oddly enough the government's market
reforms are also working. A huge proportion of the industrial workforce is
employed in at least partly privatised businesses and inflation is falling to
its lowest level since the end of the Soviet Union. The problem is that the
Russian government chose to sprint to market reforms rather than to jog at a
more comfortable pace. The result is hardship and social dislocation on a grand
scale.
If Mr Yeltsin, his Prime Minister Mr Chernomyrdin, and their supporters and
associates expected gratitude they have been disabused. They do have a fairly
high approval rating in Moscow and in St Petersburg, but the vast rural
hinterland of Russia is suffering and is not inclined to extend goodwill to the
government. All of this has serious implications for the presidential elections
which are due to be held in June 1996. Mr Yeltsin has not decided whether he
will stand, though other candidates should include the Prime Minister, the
Communist leader, and the liberal reformer Grigory Yavlinsky. If matters do not
improve for Mr Yeltsin or Mr Chernomyrdin and their supporters there may be an
attempt to delay or cancel the presidential elections. This would be a mistake,
if for no other reason than that it would be a betrayal of democracy. Having
established their principles the reformers must stand or fall by them. In the
meantime, a little judicious easing of the lot of the people would not come
amiss.

FROM New Jersey in the higher storeys of this page appeared a complaint about
how American visitors to Britain's shores keep being invited to follow a
rolling English road. Even pilgrims who seek to take to a trail of whisky
distilleries are first beckoned to London, although sometimes tourist publicity
directs them first to Manchester or even Birmingham.
``I had never heard of Scotch distilleries in England,'' the NJ letter-writer
sharply penned.
Although voiced for even longer than the most exotic malt is allowed to mature,
his is a grudge that has not mellowed with time.
Much can be said for going to London first, and most of it has been said
officially. Unadvertised is what a great place it is to get out of. And the
farther the better. Whisky's allure may be at its most golden there. More than
anywhere else is the call of Speyside and some Isles at its most siren-voiced
in London.
It was from there that the first great whisky trail started. The pathfinder was
an explorer called Alfred Barnard. His journey of discovery he called not a
trail nor a trek but a distillery track. As he warmed to the work, his gadding
about acquired an extra glow. He took to describing his adventures as
``spiritual wanderings''. It was his heightened mashing of journalistic corn.
Alfred Barnard wrote for Harper's Weekly Gazette, a weekly sheet devoted (its
word) to the wine and spirits trades. Subscribers paid all of #1.25 a year. At
that price, and unlike much posh tourist literature, the magazine recognised
there were parts of the country outside London. Each Saturday's issue was
posted the night before to Scottish customers so they received their copies
along with everybody else.
For a bonus they had Barnard right in among them for two years, which was how
long it took him, off and on, to track round every distillery.
There were 129 of them; England had four whose output was then allowed to be
mixed with Scotch. In Ireland there were 28. Barnard bagged every one.
He just turned up at the distillery gate and asked if he might come in. Only
once was he refused. About a Belfast factory he noted: ``The proprietor stands
conspicuous as being unwilling to allow an inspection of his works - for what
reason we are unable to explain.''
Undaunted, the wanderer hung about to chat up the owner's son. So he kept his
chronicle complete as to the distillery's output figures, its age, and such
good stuff.
That was the foot-in-the-door reporter side of Barnard coming out. Otherwise,
he was a rare bird of his trade. For how he succeeded in calling on so many
whisky oases and living to write about them he may be unique.
Every worn-out hack needs a hero to keep him scribbling, and Alfred Barnard for
this month of the year becomes mine. Which is why the passing chance of a
letter to the editor had to be grasped to put some ink again on his name.
When Barnard's meanderings became a book entitled - what else? - the Whisky
Distillers of the United Kingdom, a classic tome of l887, he felt a need to
explain why he had done it.
By way of introducing himself he told his readers what he wasn't. He was not a
distiller. From people in the business Barnard expected to take it on the neck
when he made technical mistakes, as he was sure he would.
Really, he was out of his depth in another country. He had a hard time getting
the industry's jargon straight in his head. Haunted is how he reads with every
scrivener's fear that his next job will find him out. When he had to write with
apparent authority about Washbacks, Worm-tubs, Mash-tuns, and even Underbacks,
he always gave them the courtesy of capital letters to show respect and suggest
that he appreciated their importance, while he hoped to appear as if he knew
what he was talking about.
He learned as he went. ``I acquired quite a zest for these distillery
studies,'' he said.
Although he did not say so, he had the best of qualifications. He loved the
stuff. He knew enough to know that whisky is the best of drinks. To suit the
balanced view of his trade magazine he had to express his fondness more
cannily. He settled for: ``Good whisky, as a beverage, is the most wholesome
spirit in the world.''
Also, it was made in some of the world's most wholesome places. He conceded
that distilleries were not the worst resorts for a roving reporter to have fun
finding out in: ``They are invested with no ordinary attractions by their
picturesque surroundings and the magnificent country in which they are
placed,'' he inscribed.
Regrettably, a part of his purpose was educational, which should not be a
scribbler's aim. He believed that many whisky merchants and other pedlars of
the cratur didn't know what they were selling. It was time that they did.
Besides, he had a nose for a scoop. Nobody else had done anything before him so
off-beat as a whisky odyssey. He was the first with the whole picture.
Furthermore (as Alfred Barnard might have put it but did not), his pioneering
idea got him out of the office. During two years he was from London far.
Perhaps, tourism's urging to see the Thames before the Spey is not totally daft.

WITH reference to the re-submitted plan to create a navigable canal across
Central Scotland, costing #30m, one wonders whether due consideration has been
given to the road traffic congestion problems which would ensue in the event of
the Forth and Clyde canal being reopened.
Several main thoroughfares cross the canal, for example, the A81 Anniesland to
Milngavie and beyond would require a swing bridge at Temple, north of
Anniesland Cross.
In Clydebank the canal is crossed by Kilbowie Road, the A812, and there will be
several other instances of roads crossing the canal along its 60-70 miles, all
requiring opening bridges, and in each case the net result would be an
unacceptable ``log-jam'' of traffic.
In pre-war days, when the volume of road traffic was very much less than it is
today, the writer can recall that the build-up of traffic was quite
considerable, as the swing bridges (or elevating bridges) were always opened
when the oncoming vessels were perhaps half a mile upstream and there was also
quite a delay before the bridge was lowered after the passage of the vessel.
Today's road traffic is many times what it was in pre-war days.
Reopening discrete sections of the canal between certain locks would however be
a feasible proposition, as has been done in the Kirkintilloch area, thereby
providing pleasant recreational facilities without causing obstruction to road
traffic.
One argument for reopening the canal has been that freight could be transported
across Scotland, thereby lessening the congestion on the already overloaded
road system. This would not be a viable proposition due to the freight being
transported by small slow-moving barges. Any fast-moving vessel would quickly
erode the banks of the canal.
The obvious solution to relieving the road system would be to regenerate an
efficient rail-link between east and west. this would be a more pragmatic
approach.
It must appear rather strange to the administrators of the Millennium Fund that
a second bid for funding for the canal project amounting to less than one-third
of the original request for #95m has now been submitted.
The reopening plans are said to have been ``refocused''; perhaps Mr Stirling,
of the British Waterways Board, could explain the reason for the very large
difference between the original request for #95m and the ``refocused'' #30m now
thought to be sufficient.
Despite the fact that 30,000 people are in favour of the reopening project, it
is felt that many more people would consider that #95m or #30m could be put to
better use.

MAJOR advances in yield potential for UK cereals are in the pipeline, according
to David Taylor, chairman of the British Society of Plant Breeders.
``In the current first-year winter wheat national list trials you will find 13
varieties at, or above, the yield of the 1995 recommended list leader,'' he
said.
``In winter oilseed rape 33 varieties could all beat the most popular high
yielding variety. This is the dividend of investing royalties in programmes
designed specifically to produce quality varieties which perform well under
British conditions.''
Frost warning
A FROST warning for the seed potato industry was issued yesterday by the
Scottish Office Agriculture Department. All movement of seed potatoes in
Grampian, Tayside and Fife regions should cease until further notice unless
approved protective measures can be taken. The warning applies particularly to
the loading of consignments for export.
Feed advice
THE SSPCA has suggested that farmers should be one step ahead of winter weather
by moving extra fodder closer to livestock before bad weather sets in. Its
warning also applies to people with horses or ponies over-wintering in the open.
Wages post
Christine Davis has been appointed chairman of the Scottish Agricultural Wages
Board by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth. She succeeds R A Bennet, QC, who
retired last month. Mrs Davis has been an independent member of the board since
1990. She is also currently chairman of the Scottish Legal Aid Board and is a
director and trustee of the National Energy Foundation and Energy Action
Scotland.

SCOTTISH milk producers would be well advised to bear in mind the combined
strength they can bring to the market through membership of co-operatives,
Henry Graham, agricultural services manager of the Clydesdale Bank, said
yesterday. In the wake of de-regulation there were a number of very strong
businesses buying milk from dairy producers, he said - but they could not buy
all the milk produced in Scotland.
``I do not think there will be many more buyers of milk who will want direct
suppliers,'' he emphasised. ``It is very important for the longer-term future
that all those other producers stay together with the co-operatives.''
In general, he said that farm produce marketing in this country was still in
need of urgent and sustained attention.
``Scottish agriculture is still far behind its competitors in relation to
organised marketing. That is probably because the average size of our farm
businesses is so much larger than elsewhere in Europe. We feel we are large
enough as individuals to stand on our own. Well, we aren't.
``The industry is currently so fragmented that there is little or no collective
voice. Meanwhile, the marketing mountain we must climb, if we are to succeed,
is so large that even the visionaries are losing interest.''
On milk quota, Mr Graham said the bank's position had always been that quota
allocations should be regarded as an asset which could depreciate, rather than
something which would retain its value forever.
In a review of the past year, he said land prices were up at least 20% compared
with 1994. It had been noticeable that farmers with no family waiting to follow
them into the business were taking advantage of good prices and selling up.
It was difficult, he said, to justify some of the prices being paid for land,
related to its earning capacity. It was important, therefore, that farmers
expanding their holding should have sufficient funds of their own to put into a
deal, otherwise they could finish up with a business which was not profitable.
In general terms, he said, Scottish agriculture had had a good year and the
indications were that farmers had been spending wisely by re-investing in their
businesses. Farm investment was increasing but bank lending had been static -
an indication profits were being ploughed back into businesses.
While some farms were setting themselves up well for the future, others were
prepared to operate on a stand-still basis which, he warned, could be
dangerous. ``In the longer term if you are standing still, you are falling
behind.
``The bank has noted a wide range of performance between individual businesses
with the best of them achieving a profit, before financing costs, of 40% of
turnover. The worst businesses could be achieving as little as 15% to 20%. That
could mean a variation between #80,000 and #40,000 profit in a business with
#200,000 turnover.''
Mr Graham warned farmers that impending changes to the structure of the
European Union meant they should take on board now the need to prepare for
changes in the support mechanism.
The community was beginning to debate the integration of eastern European
countries, he said. Questions had to be asked about the sustainability of
current EU supports. The general liberalisation of trade around the world was
also likely to make the EU's structure of quotas and support programmes
difficult to maintain in the future.
He pointed out that sterling's weakness, which in the short term had been a
significant advantage to exports, was now starting to have a visible effect on
the cost of imported farming inputs such as fertiliser, soya and machinery
parts.
``All rising costs must be identified and understood by farm business managers
and treated as an area to avoid if at all possible,'' he said. ``All too often,
cost increases which appear to be outwith our control tend to be noted and
accepted as a fact of business life. It doesn't always follow, however, that
such simple acceptance is correct.''
The Clydesdale, he said, ran a programme which allowed producers to check their
trading ratios against both industry averages and ranges. These checks
highlighted a tremendous variation in performance between businesses which were
essentially the same in all but name.

THE latest offering from the Adam Smith Institute concerning a proposed opt-out
for future ``lifetime insurance and basic pension benefits'' (December 13) is
noted by this senior citizen who has contributed to the NHS since its inception.
My generation, who answered the nation's call to fight Hitler's bid for world
domination, only 20 years after the war to end wars, when the cream of this
nation's manhood perished, honestly believed they would have achieved a better
future than the previous generation.
This seemed to be so until our industries with skilled jobs began to disappear,
evaporated it seemed with the false gold of North Sea oil revenues which
(unlike Norway's) were not used for investing in infrastructure and the
modernising of British industry.
Much more was made of the service sector - consultancy, insurance, and other
financial jobs - while overseas concerns dominated the oil exploration and
production.
How sad that Norwegians have to be the only successful merchant shipbuilders on
the Clyde because of a lack of private risk capital, entrepreneurial and modern
(not adversarial) management.
One wonders how my grandchildren's future incomes, in a now de-skilled and
unregulated low-wage economy, will support all of these proposed insurance
premiums, plus private health care and redundancy insurance, as well as
existing commitments - life insurance, mortgage protection, house and car
insurance - and of course further insurance to pay for residential or nursing
care in old age.
There will need to be enormous wage increases, because present incomes would be
entirely taken up with these costs.
I am resigned to the prospect of having my home sold, at a knockdown price in
the present depressed market, which would barely finance two years' care.
Sadly my own family, now approaching middle age, are threatened with the
scourge of ageism (down-sizing, right-sizing, greater efficiency, etc), their
contributory pension rights curtailed, and the difficulty of re-employment,
regardless of any re-training, at anything like their previous salaries.
Few of us, certainly not politicians, have any immediate solution for a
situation which is ahead. All I can state is that if any insurance company had
taken the equivalent of my NHS premiums since 1948 and changed the terms for
settling, they would most certainly have faced criminal prosecution.

EDINBURGH University may have to have to fork out up to #1500 to bring back
their players from holiday for a frost-postponed national league match against
Duns on Saturday, after being refused permission by the Scottish Rugby Union to
play the game on one of the other official stand-by dates, writes Alan Lorimer.
Both stand-by dates - December 23 and 30 - occur in vacation time, but the
latter would have been less problematic for the students than this coming
Saturday, because of its proximity to Christmas.
``Many of our first-selection players have already gone home to Northern
Ireland and to England,'' stated Randall Philip, the club's fixture secretary,
who is angered by what he sees as the SRU's unsympathetic attitude to student
rugby.
Philip contacted the SRU to suggest that the second stand-by date would be
preferable.
``In the interim a letter was received from the SRU dictating that our
postponed league game be played on December 23. I contacted Gregor Nicolson of
the SRU, pointing out the difficulties posed for our club by having to play on
December 23, and asked if the championship committee might allow us to play the
game a week later.
``While sympathetic to our situation, he indicated that there would be no
exceptions made by the championship committee. He did, however, suggest that
should the club not be able to fulfil the fixture on December 23, then the most
likely sanction would be forfeiting league points,'' said Philip, who had also
asked Scotland's director of rugby Jim Telfer to intervene.
The University are now dismayed by the SRU's refusal to accommodate their
problems.
``What makes me even angrier is that, following the SRU's capitulation to the
anti-university hawks over the principle of early-season dispensations, we have
stuck to our task and loyally fulfilled all our league commitments, despite the
fact that leagues start early in September and term starts in the the second
week of October,'' added Philip.
However, the students will contest the match rather than be seen not to fulfil
a fixture. ``The championship rules state that failure to fulfil a fixture
could lead to a club being suspended from, or thrown out of, the leagues. We
were certainly not going to give the SRU the opportunity to do that,'' said
Philip, who is further angered by learning that Duns apparently wanted the game
played on December 23.
``Duns are not prepared to enter into the spirit of Christmas when that
interferes with the possibility of gaining two easy points,'' said Philip, who
feels that if Duns do defeat a weakened University side, then it could affect
the relative league positions of other clubs in Division 1.
Edinburgh, who beat Duns in the first half of the national league, will fulfil
the fixture at Peffermill, where all the usual comforts and hospitality will be
missing. As university and catering staff will be on holiday, there will be no
hot water, no bar, and no catering.

THE final arrival of the Loch Lomond by-laws is welcomed by everyone who has
watched the rapid deterioration of the loch over the past 10 years. The by-laws
are, however, but one tiny step in what promises to be a long haul, the
ultimate aim of which must be to restore Loch Lomond's standing as a
magnificent national and international icon. In that long-term context it was
fascinating to note in last week's Government White Paper on rural Scotland the
unequivocal commitment to sustainable development. The paper recalled that the
UK had endorsed Agenda 21 at the Rio Earth Summit, even taking the lead in
committing ourselves to make future development sustainable. Sustainable
development is not just a high-flown concept for international agencies, the
White Paper declared. But what price sustainable development on Loch Lomond?
Last summer, for the first time, scientists found concentrations of petrol
pollutants at loch hot-spots used by water skiers, jet skiers, and speed
boaters many times higher than the acceptable UK criteria. On many bonnie
summer nights a thick blue fug of petrol fumes could be seen for miles as
dozens of ski boats and jet skis screamed round and round at high speed. Our
standard is far, far lower than those applied in the rest of the EU and a
fraction of that allowable in the United States. Apart from the unacceptability
of this kind of environmental damage, Loch Lomond is a public water supply, so
there is a cost implication for purification. The by-laws, while regulating
behaviour around the extreme fringes, in effect hand over in excess of 90% of
the loch surface to fast-speed boating. The 50mph speed limit will do nicely,
thank you.
The Scottish Office is presumably perfectly well aware of the situation on the
English lakes, where fast-speed boating - banned from all but Windermere -
reached such unacceptable levels there as to merit the national park authority
laying out at least #500,000 on a public inquiry in pursuit of a blanket 10mph
speed limit. While that result is still awaited, the Broads Authority, a
national park in all but name, is currently seeking to ban water skiing on the
10 stretches of river there on which it is allowed, simply because it has
become an inappropriate activity. As with the lakes, it has become
unsustainable which forces us to ask how long it will be before this happens on
Loch Lomond. The Labour Party had a national park for Loch Lomond as a
manifesto promise last time round and both Mr Sam Galbraith and Mr John McFall
want this as an election commitment. The way forward for the Scottish Office
would be to seek a joint board with planning powers as soon as possible,
instead of the current, weak-as-water, joint committee. People should be able
to enjoy Loch Lomond but real vision and strong action has to be applied if
anything worthwhile is going to be left for our children.

EDINBURGH Wanderers' referee Ray Megson, who raised the temperature of the
David Sole affair by refusing to officiate at Raeburn Place until the SRU had
dealt with the former Scotland captain, was yesterday confirmed as one of
Scotland's international selection panel, writes Derek Douglas.
Sole was banned for five months for saying that the performance of Kelso
referee Colin Henderson had been ``tantamount to cheating'' after Edinburgh
Academicals' premiership tie with Melrose.
Accies' spokesman Magnus Moodie said: ``The sentence is harsh. Players are
suspended for six weeks for standing on heads. David has been banned until the
end of the season for what the SRU say is a `breach of etiquette' ''.
The other members of the referees' international selection panel are Jim
Fleming (Boroughmuir), Ken McCartney (Hawick), Chuck Muir (Langholm), and Eddie
Murray (Greenock Wanderers). McCartney is to referee the England v Wales
international on February 3. The touch judges are Megson and Murray.

THE Glasgow City Amnesty Group has written to several local MPs urging them to
ask the UK Government to show in a public report that equipment proposed for
export to Nigeria will not be used to violate human rights.
The world was shocked by the Nigerian Government's judicial murder of Ken
Saro-Wiwa and eight others on November 10. The broader human rights situation
in Nigeria is worse than it has been for over 30 years.
Although the UK Government has extended restrictions on arms sales, financial
aid, and travel visas to the Nigerian military Government, these restrictions
may not cover riot-control equipment, police equipment, or instruments to
restrain prisoners.
Moreover we are concerned about reports that a British-based firm has made and
exported hanging ropes to Commonwealth countries and we are calling on the UK
Government to clarify if the Crown Agents or any private companies have
exported hanging ropes to Nigeria in the past, and whether it is possible that
such rope could have been used for the extra-judicial murders of Ken Saro-Wiwa
and the eight others.

HELPING out at home is a particularly dangerous tenet for either a trustee or a
beneficiary of a pension scheme and Alex Falconer's arguments in his article -
Funds pensioned off overseas, December 8 - cannot be left unchallenged.
If you lose your job you do not want to lose your pension as well and this has
led quite properly to accepted limits on self-investment.
Similarly, the decline of sterling and the greater economic growth of some
overseas markets plus the need for diversification to offset investment risk
have been the main drivers for increased exposure to foreign assets by pension
funds.
In 1984 Arthur Scargill, then president of the National Union of Mineworkers,
lost a court bid to forbid the Coal Board Pension Fund from increasing overseas
investment or investing in directly competing energy industries such as oil.
The following guidelines were laid down by Vice-Chancellor Megarry and are if
anything more relevant today: ``The power of investment must be exercised so as
to yield the best return for the beneficiaries judged in relation to the risks
of the investment in question.
``The large size of pension funds emphasises the need for diversification
rather than lessening it, and the fact that much of the fund has been
contributed by members of the scheme seems to me to make it even more important
that the trustees should exercise their powers in the best financial interests
of the beneficiaries.''

I WAS at first amused and then offended by Mr Don's letter (December 15). He
may well be fed up with people trying to explain the need for devolution. He is
also entitled to think that should an MP go, on his own, and sit in Parliament
House in Edinburgh, that that is the way forward.
What he clearly does not understand is that if there is to be any point in an
MP sitting in Edinburgh then the law has to be organised in such a way that
this parliament has some power.
This is why the Liberal Democrats have taken a major lead in developing the
case for a devolved parliament in Edinburgh.
As for Mr Don's comment about the Liberals being afraid of power, if it weren't
so offensive, it would be laughable. Yes, we are pro-European, but we are also
determined that power should be as close to the people it affects as possible,
hence our reason for being involved in the Constitutional Convention from the
beginning.

GAVIN Hastings and Rob Andrew have heralded the rise of professionalism as the
driving force behind the home nations' bid to close the gap on southern
hemisphere giants South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia.
They make their claim in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Review, which will be
screened on the ITV network on Saturday. They insist that professionalism
brings with it a ``killer instinct'' which could be the vital ingredient if one
of the home nations is to lift the World Cup in 1999.
Andrew, now the director of rugby at Newcastle, says: ``There's almost a
cultural change we need in the northern hemisphere. It relates to
professionalism - being professional about winning from an early age.
``I think the advent of professionalism is good for the northern hemisphere.
It's the only way the likes of Scotland, Ireland, and England can live with the
southern hemisphere. We've got to get all these players playing at a higher
level and making winning important.''
Hastings, Scotland's record points-scorer, puts the 14-match unbeaten run that
has been built by world champions South Africa down to a professional outlook.
He says: ``We're just not groomed to have this killer instinct. One-offs yes,
but achieving that level of consistency smacks of true professionalism.''
Their comments are part of a one-hour long review that looks back on last
summer's Rugby World Cup in South Africa. Newsreader Trevor McDonald looks back
at the tournament's highs and lows and discusses with Andrew and Hastings the
remarkable changes in the game that have followed.
q FORMER Scotland coach Douglas Morgan, the current A team manager, will
oversee Scotland's build-up to the 1997 World Sevens Cup in Hong Kong. Morgan,
who will have recently retired Scotland flanker Iain Morrison as his assistant,
will manage the sevens' side when they appear at the Hong Kong tournament next
year and also at RWC Dubai qualifying event.
q LONDON Scottish are asking the Rugby Football Union to investigate an
incident in which fly-half John Steele received two fractures to his jaw.
Steele has twice undergone surgery after the incident during a match between
the clubs on October 21 and is expected to have a plate removed next spring.
London Scottish say the decision to cite Blackheath's Leon White was taken
after talks between the two clubs failed to produce a satisfactory response.

I ATTENDED a public meeting at which a Central Regional Council official made
the statement, ``Any landowner can ask anyone to leave his land,'' the
implication being that ``anyone'' would then have to obey.
The subject under discussion was public access to Dumyat and other parts of the
Ochils. Being naturally suspicious of officialdom, I am not inclined to take
this statement at face value.
Just what is the legal position? What happened to the right to roam? Do we
still have it? Has it been taken away, or has it been allowed to quietly slip
away under a drizzle of statements?
I doubt if I am the only one who would like to know.

IN her review of the Brunton panto, Sleeping Beauty, Mary Brennan notes that my
script follows close on the heels - and the storyline - of the version recently
featuring Les Dennis as Lester the Jester and as such she says, ``It's a shame
the script itself wasn't a bit fresher'', implying at best slavish imitation on
my part and at worst plagiarism (December 15).
Compounding matters further, she says she found the Brunton script ``sparse''
compared to that featuring Les Dennis (which played the Edinburgh and Glasgow
King's in 1993 and 1994 respectively), all of which is very strange - not to
say contradictory - as they are, in fact, basically the same script.
I should know (as perhaps should your critic) as I wrote this script originally
for the Les Dennis Edinburgh King's production in 1993.

ALEC Stewart is in danger of losing his place as Mike Atherton's opening
partner if the Test series ravaged by rain ever gets going again.
While South Africa yesterday did their bit to rekindle interest after another
wash-out by calling up exciting spinner Paul Adams, England started planning
for Jason Gallian's arrival. The signs are that the new recruit will find
himself opening with Lancashire team-mate Atherton in Port Elizabeth when the
fourth Test begins - weather permitting - on Boxing Day.
Stewart's future in the team is not under threat, but a move to No.3 could
solve two of England's problems. The vice-captain has now gone 15 Tests as an
opener without scoring a half-century.
In addition, someone has to occupy the jinxed No.3 position, following John
Crawley's cruel injury - and that is where Stewart often operates for Surrey.
``There are all sorts of possibilities,'' said manager Ray Illingworth after
the third Test had been consigned to a watery grave without a ball bowled on
the final two days.
Mark Ramprakash has now been discounted as a top order candidate after three
failures, Crawley is a hobbling passenger because of his torn hamstring, and
Gallian arrives from Pakistan today after being pulled out of the A team.
To date, England have been challenged almost exclusively by pace. But that is
about to change following South Africa's decision to name two uncapped spinners
in a squad of 13 for the fourth and fifth Tests. Left-armer Nicky Boje, 22,
looked promising when Atherton's men encountered him at Kimberley and
Bloemfontein earlier this tour. Boje may well sit out the Port Elizabeth Test,
but Adams seems certain to play and could pose England real problems.
England's three-day match against a University XI at Pietermaritzburg could
become the next victim of the miserable summer weather. Officials from the
town, an hour's drive out of Durban, were originally so pessimistic about
prospects of play that they told the tourists not even to bother turning up
tomorrow.
q AN UNBEATEN 90 from opener Nick Knight helped secure victory for England A
over Pakistan A in the second one-day international in Faisalabad yesterday.
A seven-wicket victory also clinched the one-day series 2-0 with one match
still to play. They won the three-match Test series 1-0.
England bowled and fielded better than in their first 40-over match,
restricting the Pakistanis to a meagre 186 for six on a flat pitch.
Pakistan opener Shahid Anwar batted through the innings but his runs dried up
towards the end as Richard Stemp, Ronnie Irani, and Dean Headley kept him
mainly to singles.
Knight picked up two leg-side 6s during his innings and put on 110 in 21 overs
with the fluent Nasser Hussain, whose 50 took only 67 balls. Jason Pooley
stepped on the gas before being run out and England still had nine balls
remaining when Knight struck the winning boundary.
q RICHIE Richardson yesterday insisted that there is no crisis in the West
Indies' camp after they crashed to defeat in their opening two World Series
limited-overs matches against Australia and Sri Lanka.
They need to beat Australia in Melbourne today to keep alive their hopes of
making the final of the triangular tournament.Australian vice-captain Ian Healy
said his team was not expecting a repeat of Sunday's record 121-run triumph
over the West Indies in Adelaide.

RICHARD Gallacher objects to arts companies spending money on costumes while
there are still poor people in Britain (December 14).
If the Royal Opera House is spending #300 on a tutu then that money is going to
one of the thousands of people in this country who earn their living by making
costumes for the theatre. I am one of them and I can assure Mr Gallacher that
ours is not an overpaid profession. Nor is #300 too generous recompense for the
great number of hours spent on making a tutu.
If arts companies were to stop using pretty costumes on stage then the first
result would be to make a great many theatrical costumiers unemployed, thus
only adding to the number of people living in damp, unhealthy conditions.
Certainly the Government must strike a balance between what it spends on the
arts and what it spends on the poor but the answer is not to force theatre
companies to make such severe cuts that hard-working and dedicated staff are
made to suffer. Not to mention audiences across Britain whose lives are
enhanced by the magic of the theatre.
I wonder how Mr Gallacher earns his living; I don't imagine it is anything
frivolous.

IAN LANG'S statement in July 1994 that ``the Forestry Commission woodlands
should remain in the public sector'' deceived many people who then stopped
campaigning against the sell-off.
Last July the Council for the Protection of Rural England in conjunction with
its Scottish and Welsh counterparts (APRS and CPRW) drew attention to the
continuing sell-off.
Since 1981 nearly half a million acres have been sold and only 76,000 acres
acquired. Guaranteed public access has been retained on only 1137 acres.
From the commission lists entitled Disposals of Forestry Land and Woodlands
from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1994, I counted 203 woodlands comprising
28,000 acres.
Only occasionally is information given on who was the buyer and the price. No
statement on whether public access has been retained is published alongside
each sale.
The CPRE reports that a further 20,000 acres of commission land was on the
market during the first half of 1995. Advertisements appear in the Estates
Gazette showing dozens of our much loved Forestry Commission public woodlands
as Government surplus land. This really makes my blood boil.
The World Wide Fund for Nature has stated: ``Evidence over the years has shown
that our most valuable woodlands, and the plants and animals that have their
homes there, are not safe in private hands. Many are still being destroyed and
not necessarily by bulldozers but by grazing animals. Illegal persecution of
wild animals is still a fact of life in many areas.
``This Government does not adequately enforce the laws already in place and has
failed for years to close loopholes that allow woodland destruction to
continue.''
This is no way contradicts the fact that there are a number of excellent
private owners.
The Government's policy was summed up by John Gummer when he said that ``the
key benefits are that it would raise money and get the forest estate out of the
public sector.''
This met stiff opposition so privatisation continues by the back door. We've
paid for our public woodlands over many years and this deceitful sell-off is
utterly despicable.

SELLING to other businesses is tough. You are confronted by a sophisticated
customer - cautious, cynical and slow to say yes, yet demanding quality,
performance and service as well as a keen price.
Compulsory competitive tendering has become a familiar term in recent years
especially in the public sector. But to the exporter, and those familiar with
the oil and gas industries, bidding and tendering have been normal practice for
years.
How, then, should you react to an invitation to tender? If you already have the
contract then you worry: what's wrong with us, are we going to lose it? If you
have never had the work, you are jumping for joy: we are in with a chance, they
have obviously heard good things about us.
And yet, the difficulties of selling via the tender process are legion.
Cranking out proposal after proposal is soul destroying, especially when others
appear to have an inside track.
Today, we look at a new book on the tendering process which is already gaining
a formidable reputation. Our reviewer is a leading expert in this area, Geoff
Runcie (left), chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.
YOU don't need to be at the forefront of Scotland's export drive or placing
contracts worth millions to identify with the process of competitive bidding
and tendering.
The business community may have raised this process to an art form, but in our
everyday purchases, we are continually assessing suppliers' offerings, prices
and, of course, value for money in relation to our own requirements.
Winning the Bid* by Neil Tweedley is more of a school book than a late evening
novel, but I found myself having as many laughs from it as I have had from many
a Broons annual. The laughs, of course, were at my own expense, as I identified
many of my own failings and reflected on my years in industry.
The book sets the process of competitive tendering against the backdrop of
industry and commerce, and I found it a valuable reference to remind me what
should be done, rather than what is done in many situations.
In most cases, competitive bidding is about teamwork, and I certainly think
this would be an extremely useful book for a study project by a bid team
preparing to tender for highly competitive contracts. The many graphical
representations of the processes set out in the book would be valuable at team
briefings.
One of its strengths is the way it makes the reader realise that the tendering
and bidding process applies equally to all sizes of business, whether employing
a thousand, a hundred or one.
Invariably, potential customers require uniformity and compliance within the
bidding process and in small companies this means a large amount of work being
done by very few people. I know from my own experience this can place a
considerable strain on everyone in the bidding team, especially those who deal
directly with the customer.
The author might have considered the comment which particularly sticks in my
mind - ``always be prepared to be surprised''. All my experience of tendering
tells me this is the most effective form of contingency planning. No matter
what assumptions are made, expect your customer to turn them upside down at the
first view of your bid. Be prepared to revise it and be flexible to his
requirements.
Two other areas could have been given more prominence. First, the importance of
the ongoing relationship with clients - every opportunity needs to be taken to
talk; be at every meeting and attend every technical discussion. There are
signals to be picked up, messages to be received and information to be
assimilated at every stage of the process. If you are not close to your
potential client, then you may not get the information your competitors get.
Second, I am concerned the author does not give sufficient stress to the act of
lodging the bid. I have bitter experience of lodging a sizeable bid with a
company on the other side of the world, and assuming that a courier company
would deliver the goods ``by lodging the bid with the correct authorities by
the pre-determined time''.
Not so. Our bid lay for weeks unopened, un-registered and, of course, not
valid. You are probably saying to yourself that we showed poor judgment.
Probably we did, but when a large number of bids are being placed worldwide,
you seldom have the opportunity to follow up every one.
Nor is it appropriate, depending on the culture of the country in which it is
made. Harassing senior officials to find out if you have been successful can do
your case no good and a little respectful silence is often more appropriate
after it has been lodged.
The moral is clear - at the point of lodging the bid trust nobody other than
your own direct employees or close agents.
As I finished the book I found myself coming up with my own bid check list, and
if anyone is interested, I would be happy to share a whole lot of tactical
manoeuvres. Maybe I could compile a small book called Winning the Bid - A
Between the Lines Look at the Process. I've got the scars to prove my point and
would love the chance to examine real world experiences with Neil Tweedley.
Winning the Bid is an excellent textbook, laid out in readable form, and I
would commend it to anyone who is in business and bemused by the processes that
customers employ to buy their products and services.

<HEADLINE>Cadbury takes #108m bite out of Canadian confectionery market food producers</HEADLINE>

CONFECTIONERY and soft drinks group Cadbury Schweppes has followed up its
recent purchase of sweets company Allan Candy with another, substantial,
incursion into the Canadian market, paying #108m for Neilson Cadbury, Canada's
leading chocolate bar confectionery manufacturer, from George Weston.
Canada is the 11th-largest confectionery market in the world with a volume of
244,000 tonnes split equally between sugar and chocolate. The acquisition gives
Cadbury Schweppes leadership in the chocolate segment of the market and,
following the Allan Candy buy and its integration with the group's Canadian
Trebor operations, leadership in the overall confectionery market.
Neilson Cadbury's sales for 1994 were #109m. It has a strong portfolio
including seven of the country's top 20 brands - Caramilk, Crispy Crunch, Mr
Big, Crunchie, Wunderbar, Jersey Milk and Choclairs - which together represent
25% of the chocolate segment.
Commenting on the acquisition, John Sunderland, managing director of Cadbury
Schweppes' confectionery stream, said: ``The acquisition of Neilson Cadbury in
Canada adds 40,000 tonnes to our global volume and brings market leadership in
an important market. Neilson Cadbury is a marketing-led business with a strong
brand portfolio and selling infrastructure which also provides opportunity to
develop other of our key international brands.''
The purchase, which is subject to regulatory approval, will be funded through
debt facilities. The value of the net assets to be acquired was #34m in
December 1994 and profits for the year amounted to #4.9m.
Earlier this year, Cadbury Schweppes paid #1600m for Dr Pepper/Seven Up in the
US. The shares firmed !sp to 547p.

THERE was disappointment in Oslo and elation in London, followed by trepidation
as Amec now has to live up to its promises. It was pretty clear by last
Thursday that Kvaerner was losing as the Amec price drifted increasingly away
from the 100p offer.
The argument that rejection of the bid was a good two-way bet carried
increasing weight. After all, Kvaerner has spent #50m on its quarter stake and,
according to finance director Jan Magne Heggelund, is now standing back to
evaluate its position.
The Amec share price is almost certainly near its floor at 93p being
underpinned for the next year until Kvaerner decides to bid again - assuming
that it has not passed the stake on.
If the new management at Amec under Peter Mason does begin to achieve some of
the targets, there would still be scope for the two companies to co-operate
even more closely than they are at present in various joint ventures.
That could be one of the options now being considered by Kvaerner, although
obtaining a British passport through ownership of a UK registered company
remains a key part of its stategy to expand more effectively into Asian markets.
Erik Tonseth said last night the reason it lost was a question of valuation.
But he could not justify a higher price.
Undoubtedly the whole battle was flawed by being too aggressive and adviser SBC
Warburg trying to push matters to a decision within just 21 days.
However, there is the consolation that everyone in the City knows who Kvaerner
is and that it is not shrouded in Nordic mists. It has done itself quite a bit
of good for the longer term. Also the fact that its fees were based on a
success basis is a little balm.
Dog eat dog
IVORY &amp; Sime, under the watchful eye of Cayzer family appointee Colin Hook, has
taken decisive action to resurrect its investment performance and ensure its
survival in the dog-eat-dog world of fund management.
But, as the recent fracas at Dunedin Fund Managers has illustrated, something
as simple as a clash of personalities can wreak havoc on the best-laid plans.
While the clock was ticking on Ivory &amp; Sime's poor handling of its flagship
British Assets Trust, Dunedin was going great guns on the other side of the
Atlantic.
Investors were so impressed by the latter's fund managers that the firm gained
#726m of net new business last year, most of it from the US.
Now the tables have turned. Ivory &amp; Sime squeezed through a controversial
restructuring of British Assets a year ago, which has since borne fruit.
But personality clashes at Dunedin have seen an exodus of top staff including
its Chicago-based marketing director, its investment director, and the heads of
its Pacific and European operations. Bank of Scotland intervened in October,
removing the chairman and deputy chief executive of its fund management
subsidiary.
Acting chairman Eric Sanderson maintains that Dunedin, in spite of its
troubles, is neither up for sale nor interested in a merger.
If it were, Ivory &amp; Sime, which like many other investment houses has weathered
its fair share of storms, would be interested. Abtrust would also like to pick
over the bones if the vultures began circling.
The chiefs of other Scottish fund management houses have been reluctant to
gloat on the troubles of a rival and not surprisingly. Any of them could
crumble as a result of infighting among senior staff.
Big appetite
HAVING decided that it was possibly too big in domestic terms and not nearly
big enough in world terms, confectionery group Cadbury Schweppes has certainly
moved imaginatively this year to correct the situation.
Yesterday's Canadian purchase, which takes it to the top in the overall
confectionery market in that country, follows up the truly substantial #1600m
swallow early in March of Dr Pepper/Seven Up, America's third largest soft
drinks maker with a 16% market share behind Pepsi on 31% and Coca-Cola on 40%.
The integration of Dr Pepper has by all accounts been going well and this has
pleased the market. The group's expansion plans have been undertaken with
considerable speed and include opening operations in both China and Russia,
though it does not, unlike some of its bigger food competitors, have limitless
resources and has to rely mostly on working with local partners in many of its
chosen geographic areas.
Its expansion has meant two rights issues in two years at 400p and 340p.
However, for the moment anyway the market seems unfazed by any fears that the
company may find itself overstretched, and certainly it has not yet seemed to
put a foot wrong in its global build-up.
An additional benefit is that the group looks to be making itself virtually bid
proof. At one time, rumours abounded with even Unilever, whose market
capitalisation still vastly exceeds that of Cadbury Schweppes, being suggested
as a possible suitor. Those rumours are no longer going the rounds. Cadbury
Schweppes itself would be a really big swallow in terms of both quality and
quantity.

IF ANYONE knows the rules of golf inside out, it is John Glover, who retires at
the end of the month after 14 years as rules secretary of the Royal and Ancient
Golf Club, the worldwide authority outside America on the subject. The
62-year-old Irishman, though, has a simple answer to the question of whether he
knows all 34 rules, sub-sections and all, off by heart.
``No,'' he replied, which stymied (a defunct rule) the supplementary challenge
to recite a rule selected at random, the first paragraph of rule 26-1, which
deals with water hazards. Still, he had a pretty good stab at it before
explaining: ``I am more concerned with understanding the purpose and intent of
the rules than learning them parrot fashion.''
One of these days, he added, he might understand them fully, meaning not that
there are serious gaps in his knowledge, but that the laws of the game are so
complex that it is a continual learning process. So are the rules too
complicated?
``No, it is a complex game and I am not a great one for wanting everything to
be simple,'' said Glover, who nevertheless is credited with having brought many
simplifications to the rules during his term. ``Usually those who want
simplicity don't bother reading anything anyway.''
It follows that he is not an advocate of the late Henry Longhurst's dictum that
the rules of golf should be capable of being written on the back of a postage
stamp. ``If they could, I imagine they would read: `The ball should be played
as it lies and if you pick it up it is a penalty.' But that would not be very
equitable in some situations. So you have to balance fairness with tradition
and in doing so the paragraphs become longer. I think we have a nice
combination.''
What percentage of club golfers' rounds would he estimate are completed without
an unwitting breach of the rules? ``I would hate to guess, but the lovely thing
is that people do try to play to the rules and any breach is unwitting.''
He reckons the most frequently misunderstood rule concerns determining the
nearest point of relief which he says ``is not the easiest thing to
comprehend,'' and personally, in matchplay, would rather overlook an unwitting
breach of rule by an opponent than have a confrontation.
Glover, the British Boys' champion in 1950 and an Irish internationalist from
1951 to 1970 - he now has ``a fictitious 3'' handicap - says the rules always
appealed to him because he found them well-ordered.
He describes them as ``an academic puzzle'' which frequently causes great
debate among golfers. He knows to keep clear when one is in process because
``the last thing they want to hear is an answer.'' He once received a written
query which said at the end: ``If you don't agree with me, don't bother to
reply.''
The answers, though, have been well promulgated over the last
decade-and-a-half, with informative videos having been put together and
referees from all over the world having come to St Andrews for training. This
educational process will continue in his ``retirement'' - which coincides with
the quadrennial revision of the rules - as he has just been appointed as
consultant to the Asian Tour next year.
Michael Bonallack, the R and A secretary, said: ``John's contribution to the
game has been immense and his intimate knowledge of the rules and his
infectious Irish humour will be greatly missed. He brought great clarity of
thought to a complex subject.''
His successor is 31-year-old David Rickman, Glover's assistant for the past
eight years. Grant Moir, aged 25, a law graduate from Edinburgh University,
takes over as assistant rules secretary.
q AMATEUR golfers are being given an extra three months to make sure the
grooves of their clubs conform to the rules.
The Ping Eye 2 irons made between 1985 and 1989 are the most commonly used
model. The deadline for having them altered has been extended from December 31
to the end of March. The Karsten Corporation, manufacturers of Ping clubs, have
developed a process of making the offending clubs legal by narrowing the
grooves.

THE decision by Johnnie Walker not to continue their sponsorship of the world
championship leaves the event in a state of suspended animation after having
been in existence for only five years. No white knight has so far been
recruited to save the event, a daunting prospect given its $2.3m prize fund.
Since the rule of thumb is that promotional and organisational costs will
double that figure, any meaningful commitment appears to be less likely still.
Failure to sustain the championship would, incidentally, damage Jamaica's
struggling economy and diminish its appeal as a golfing centre.
It is not as if the event has lacked exposure either for the sponsors or their
product. One way or another, live or delayed, this tournament, despite its
severely limited field, has been seen by as many as 500 million viewers in 91
countries, golf's contribution to the global village created by television.
Moreover, adopting such a sweeping title inevitably adds the risk of making it
a hostage to fortune, especially since there are four other events with global
aspirations - the World Cup, the Gene Sarazen World Open championship, the
Toyota World Matchplay championship, and the Five Tours Andersen Consulting
World Championship of Golf.
Five attempts to embrace planet earth do nothing, from this perspective anyway,
but debase the currency of the word. For the fact is that, for good and
sufficient reasons, the fields in these tournaments seldom, if ever, reflect in
full the contemporary strength of the game in its widest range.
Given the serious level of absenteeism from Johnnie Walker's tournament by some
of the game's leading lights, the claim made for it as it makes its last
appearance had to be severely qualified. ``The Best of the Best in the World''
fell some way short of the actuality.
There never can be a true world championship anyway until a world tour has been
established, and the sooner the better. Then and only then can a climactic
event be held which will legitimately identify a first among equals, although
even that method could become flawed enough to provoke reservations.
As matters stand, the leading professionals are by now sated with prize-money
and weary of the year's playing and travelling. November and December seem
largely to consist of milch-cow competitions designed to do little else but
further fill the boots of players whose income has already reached almost
indecent amounts.
Indeed, someone has worked out that even if the winner of a major title
finished dead last in all five of the American post-season extravaganzas, for
which he would qualify automatically, he would be guaranteeed almost $420,000
in prize-money from these events alone, never mind what he might earn on the
legitimate stage.
Pete Sampras, the Wimbledom and US Open tennis champion, recently pocketed
$750,000 for playing a 74-minute match in Munich and he probably spoke for many
in hugely rewarded sports when he said: ``I'm not stupid. It's lots of money,
Christmas money, that's the way I look at it.''
The death this month of James Reston, born into poverty in Clydebank but who
rose to become one of America's most respected political commentators, provoked
the question: what would he have made of all this potential wealth if, as at
one time he thought he might, he had turned professional?
That prospect was suggested by Reston's two consecutive victories in the Ohio
public links championship. Instead ``Scotty'', as his nickname inevitably
became, opted for newspaper sports writing and graduated from that to analysing
affairs of state more astutely and accurately than most.
But, it seems, the philosophy bred by his roots never left him when he
considered the connection between two of Scotland's greatest gifts to the world
- whisky and golf. Reston wrote that having devised the pleasure there was
nothing for it but to balance the books with the penance.
Or, as the American writer, Brendan Gill, recently noted in defining the
difference between tennis and golf: ``Tennis is murderous. You want to kill
your opponent. But golf is suicide. You want to kill yourself.'' On that
sombrely contemplative note, a very Merry Christmas.

LEN Lungo, the successsful Dumfriesshire trainer, is to appear before the
stewards of The Jockey Club in London to explain the improved form of Livio, a
well backed winner at Catterick last Saturday.
A stewards' inquiry was held after Livio, the 6-4 favourite, won the Levy Board
Handicap Hurdle by two lengths, but in the absence of the trainer, who was at
Haydock saddling 25-1 winner Swanbister, they referred the matter to Portman
Square in London.
Livio, owned by the Low Flyers Thoroughbreds Ltd, headed by Edinburgh property
developer Jim Glass, had run at Haydock the previous Saturday when he was
eighth to Great Easby.
Lungo, the reigning champion Scottish jumps trainer, is confident the affair
will be cleared up at the London hearing, and was not surprised by Livio's
success or the improvement in his performance.
The four-year-old was dropped  in the weights and conditional jockey Fraser
Perratt's allowance took a further 3lb off his back.
He has also pointed out that Livio enjoyed the advantage of dropping down to a
Class E handicap from the Class C race he ran in the previous week.
The handicapper, Tony Winlaw, has gone on record as saying he slipped up in his
assessment and has since put the Carrutherstown hurdler back up by 4lb.
Before the race, Timeform rated Livio 8lb superior to his 13 rivals and there
was quite a lot of money for him, including a bet of #2000 to win #3500.

JAMIE Osborne was the toast of the punters at Edinburgh yesterday on his first
visit for eight years, when he rode three winners, all of them favourites,
writes Tom McConnell. His 7!s-1 treble included a double for the Queen's
trainer Ian Balding and brought his season's total to 29.
The 28-year-old was in sparkling form right from the start of the meeting,
surviving a blunder by 1-4 hotpot Blaze Away at the second hurdle, but going on
to beat newcomer Jubran by 15 lengths in the Barracks Entry Maiden race. Blaze
Away's runaway success was an improvement on his last run when he was third to
Strong Promise at Ascot, beaten nine lengths. Osborne continued to be on song
in the next when he brought His Way, 7-4, home eight lengths ahead of
Pagliaccio in the Bathing Coach Novices' Chase.
The short-priced treble was completed with some style and not without a touch
of class when Shaarid, 6-4, the son of El Gran Senor, took the feature race,
the Table Handicap Chase by a comfortable 3!s lengths from Puritan.
Osborne, who rode a double at Ascot on Saturday, said he had been having a poor
season by his standards until now, but hoped the treble would prove to be a
turning point in his fortunes. It was as an amateur in January, 1987, that he
last rode over the Musselburgh track. That day he had a winner, Old Meg, in a
novice hurdle.
Balding, who trained both Blaze Away and Shaarid was absent, but a stable
representative said they had made the long trip from Berkshire because they
knew they would get good ground at Musselburgh.
The Sea Hole Selling Hurdle produced the most exciting finish of the meeting
with Brackenthwaite, the 11-4 favourite, just getting the better of Peter
Monteith's Funny Rose, 9-2, by half a length.

<HEADLINE>Royal Bank's US arm ties up deal with First Holdings</HEADLINE>

THE Royal Bank of Scotland is merging its Citizens Financial Group banking
operations with those of the Bank of Ireland's First Holdings to create a New
England-based banking combine with assets in excess of $14bn (#9100m).
This is a substantial move, boosting Citizens' existing assets by 40% and
giving it the base to penetrate the New England market even further.
First Holdings is the parent company for the First NH Bank which has 73
branches and 12 supermarket outlets in New Hampshire and so will increase the
Citizens network to 210 branches plus the supermarket units.
In addition, Citizens already has a network of 20 offices in its Citizens
Mortgage Corporation spread from Maine to Florida. The Royal will end up with
76.5% of Citizens and Bank of Ireland with 23.5%.
A full takeover was not possible as the Bank of Ireland aims to play a part in
the consolidation of the US banking industry and so wanted an interest in the
continuing expansion of Citizens.
For the first time, the Royal's finance director Robert Speirs has given a
valuation for Citizens. The enlarged company has an estimated worth of $1850m
(#1200m), which is just over twice book value or 1.3 times plus goodwill. That
is well below the price at which many US banks are being taken over, with some
acquisitions at almost three times book value.
But in this case, it is a willing merger with no premium for control. As a
result, the Royal's holding in Citizens is worth #935m compared with the
original 1988 purchase cost then equivalent to about #135m.
The deal was announced at the time of the Royal's preliminary results on
November 30 and has taken a comparatively short period to finalise.
The Royal's group chief executive, Dr George Mathewson, said: ``This is a good
deal. It will bring financial and strategic benefits to both of us. It will
increase our earnings per share without the need to add new capital and it will
lead to further strengthening our already excellent franchise in New England.''
n HSBC'S Marine Midland Bank has also been on the acquisition trail. It has
bought East River Savings bank from River Bank America for $93m (#60.4m).
