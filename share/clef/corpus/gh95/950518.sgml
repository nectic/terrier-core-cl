<HEADLINE>CU purchase pays off. Integration of French insurer Groupe Victoire going well</HEADLINE>

IT is so far so good for Commercial Union's ambitious #1460m purchase
of Groupe Victoire of France, which put it within spitting distance of
Continental giants such as Allianz and UAP, Union des Assurances de
Paris.
The acquisition made a contribution of #16m to CU's first-quarter
trading results, before related interest costs of #13m. Group pre-tax
profits for the first quarter came to #102m, up from a restated #71m.
The purchase was partly funded by a rights issue so will be dilutive at
the earnings level for the time being.
No skeletons have been uncovered and the first phase of integration
has been completed, with most administrative and management systems
combined. Originally it was planned that Groupe Victoire's life arm,
Abeille Vie, would be kept separate from CU's existing French life
company, Epargne de France.
But after further thought it has been decided to integrate the two,
despite the extra work this will entail. Victoire's own management also
felt this was the best way forward so there will be no problems there.
Tony Wyand of CU said yesterday that it had become clear efficiencies
would be achieved by amalgamation.
The addition of Victoire has made CU one of the UK's largest investors
in France. Abeille Vie is the sixth largest life insurer there and the
purchase has brought a major shift in CU's life premium income. Now 43%
of life premiums, running at almost #3000m in aggregate annually, come
from France. The UK proportion is down to 20%.
Victoire's general insurer, Abeille Assurances, has given the group a
more balanced geographical spread in this sector, with the UK branch
business representing 27% of premium income, which tops #4500m.
International operations run from London account for a further 9%, while
Continental Europe is now up to 26%, with the French contribution at
12%. The group has owned a major Dutch insurer, Delta Lloyd, for many
years. North America represents 26%.
Epargne's salesforce will become the direct sales arm under Abeille
Vie. Mr Wyand said there was little direct overlap between the two
companies' markets and Abeille had strong technical and legal
departments which meant it was good at product design. There will be
savings to come in amalgamating administrative functions and information
technology.
Only when systems are aligned in two or three years time will staff
levels be looked at. With the French life market growing rapidly there
may be no need for cuts. But the lengthy consultation procedure required
in France whenever reorganisation is planned is underway.
So it is a long-term project, though there should be short-term gains
from recovery in the French market, while further in the future CU will
benefit from a single market in European insurance, though progress so
far has been slow.
Meanwhile, in the UK the group is confident an old-fashioned
down-swing in the cycle can be avoided, with the shock of the last
decline forcing managements to be more prudent, while information
systems have given them greater control. Motor rates across the market
have fallen by some 35% but have since come back up a little as
competition has slackened. CU said its rates came down much less than
this as it sacrificed market share to sustain margins. So its car
portfolio is down 11%.
Having piled on market share when the market last turned up it is now
standing back as competition has caused rates to soften. The decline in
home insurance rates has been less marked, at up to 10%.
The City is banking on CU's proven reputation for good management to
reap the rewards from a successful integration of Victoire, but shorter
term considerations about the direction of the insurance cycle will hold
the sector back. CU shares eased 6p to 582p.

HOW bullish you are about the economic outlook for the remainder of
this year depends on what sector of industry you are in.
Reckitt &amp; Colman, with its leading international brands and wide
geographic spread, is confident it will improve its trading performance
both in the second half of this year and in 1996.
In contrast, as a leading building materials supplier and cement
group, Blue Circle Industries is uncertain about demand in the second
half.
Its chairman Sir Peter Walters said the company was cautious about
demand prospects in some areas for the second half of the year. For the
group as a whole the year is said to have started well in heavy building
materials and also in bathrooms.
Sir Peter told sharehlders that although trading conditions were
generally adverse in heating, BCI's overall performance during the first
four months had been encouraging.
Reckitt &amp; Colman, meanwhile, said that the acquisition of L&amp;F
Household at the end of 1994, restructuring in Europe and a focusing on
key brands would mean better group results from mid-1995 onwards.
Speaking at the annual general meeting, chairman Sir Michael Colman
said: ''We are confident that these actions will lay the foundations for
more positive results to show through in the second half of 1995 and for
a much improved performance in 1996 and beyond.''
The company announced 1994 profits down to #160.2m from 1993's #256.9m
after it charged #56m for European restructuring and #86.1m for the
integration of L&amp;F in the US, which it acquired from Eastman Kodak.
Reckitt is free to concentrate on developing its worldwide household
products and toiletries business since its sale of the Colman's mustards
and Robinsons drink businesses to Unilever for #250m earlier this month.
After recent strong performance Blue Circle shares dropped 10p to
304p, while Reckitt &amp; Colman were 4p ahead at 656p.

THIS week sees the start of a #1m bid by two of Scotland's local
enterprise companies to ''hold hands'' with eight Scottish firms and
steer them towards world class manufacturing status over the next three
years.
The move by the enterprise companies in Renfrewshire and
Dunbartonshire recognises that a series of national initiatives
currently being used to improve business performance could have greater
impact when fully integrated. These include programmes aimed at quality,
skills development, and the management of change.
Eight companies, including world giants like Ciba Pigments at Paisley,
David Murray's Mimtec at Greenock, and the management buy-out teams at
GMI (Gas Measurement Instruments) in Renfrew, and Devro, at Cumbernauld
have signed up for the first pioneering programmes.
Jim Cunningham, business development director at Renfrewshire
Enterprise, sees the initiative as a natural extension of the current
business support programmes being provided by the enterprise network.
He said: ''Assisting in the creation of new companies is vital but it
is equally important that we help established companies to grow and
prosper and ensure that they are world class. Our companies have to be
simply the best.
''This initiative provides a holistic approach to business
development, reviewing each company's activities, providing
implementation plans in manufacturing, marketing, people development and
finance.
''The results will not be seen overnight. In some cases we will be
working with companies for as long as three years providing expertise
and consultancy support.''

WOMEN prisoners in Scotland are to be offered HIV tests for the first
time today, when a survey team visits Cornton Vale Prison at Stirling.
Similar tests have already uncovered cases of HIV infection among the
male prison population and also revealed the existence of a major
epidemic among a significant group of drugs injectors inside Glenochil
Prison.
The 92% uptake of the tests at Barlinnie, Glasgow, last October -- the
most recent programme -- was the best to date in any adult prison in the
UK. The Cornton Vale survey will be the first for women in the UK.
The programme, carried out by independent medical researchers on
behalf of the Scottish Prison Service, produces estimates of the
prevalance of the infection and of risk behaviour among prisoners who
give a saliva sample and complete a questionnaire about their
lifestyles, both on an anonymous basis. The tests identify antibodies in
the saliva.
Prisoners who want to know their own status can request a subsequent
blood test.

* NEWLANDS face a baptism of fire in the premier division of the Men's
Everest National Club League when they take on the David Lloyd Club
Bushey and then Banbury West End in their opening fixtures this weekend.
Australian Brent Larkham and British No.7 Nick Gould have been named
in the Bushey squad for Saturday's home fixture while Larkham's brother
Todd, winner of the recent Satellite event in Edinburgh, will lead the
Banbury team in Sunday's away tie.
But Newlands captain Malcolm Watt, the Scottish No.4, has strengthened
the side who struggled to retain their place among the top 12 British
teams last year.
He said: ''We have added Scottish full-timers Jason Barnett and Euan
McGinn to our existing squad of Calum McKnight, Ian MacAulay, Ronnie
Terras, and myself.
We know what we'll be up against this year, so we are much better
prepared and hopefully we can do enough to stay.''
Newlands women make their premier-division debut after having won the
regional play-offs last year and have added teenage full-timer Nicola
Burns to their line-up of Heather Lockhart, Marjorie Love, and Jennifer
Shaw. They open on Saturday away to Bramhall Park, whose squad include
Scottish junior champion Julia Taylor, while on Sunday they play host to
Huddersfield.
Scottish No.1 Ross Matheson will represent Newcastle side Castle Farm
in the defence of the men's title, while Michele Mair will play for
Queen's Club.
Matheson lost 6-3, 6-4 to Australian Allen Belobrajdic yesterday in a
second-round match in the LTA Satellite Masters at Bournemouth. But
fellow Scot Miles Maclagan continued his winning run when he dismissed
South African Brendan Curry 6-1, 6-2 in the quarter-final.

* THE Scottish Athletic Federation have taken exception to remarks
made on a TV programme, Sport in Question, which on one of its rare
excursions into athletics was fed information which was spectacularly
wrong.
A coach in the audience blamed a late grant application for Scotland's
failure to host this year's major international, and the panel
pontificated on the situation. In fact, SAF's grant application to the
Scottish Sports Council was made earlier than usual, and the cost of
hosting this match was not part of the application.
An SAF cash shortfall and sponsorship problems forced the fixture to
be shifted to Wales, who now also are experiencing difficulties.

THE end of the recession could lead to more companies passing into
non-Scottish hands. Many smaller firms are seizing their opportunity to
sell and larger firms taking advantage of spare cash, to pick up
bargains.
Most of the recent activity has involved the acquisition of Scottish
firms by English buyers but some are from further afield.
Alastair Burrow, of McClure, Naismith, Anderson and Gardiner, suggests
this is because of a less entrepreneurial approach to business in
Scotland. ''Here people are more cautious and happier with what they've
got,'' he said.
''They have an attitude of 'this is my business and I want to retain
control'. However, lately there has been more willingness to spread
equity around, to compromise on control to allow business to expand.''
At Dickson Minto, partner Roddy Bruce reports: ''We are busy on
mergers and acquisitions. We have a large number of small and medium
transactions going on and a few large transactions.''
In spite of this activity the firm has noticed fewer clients relying
on warranties to cement their transactions. This is because of an
increase in the amount of due diligence carried out by purchasers prior
to completing agreements.
Mr Bruce said: ''This does not normally replace warranties, but it
does mean that the purchaser will rely to a greater extent on the due
diligence and to a slightly lesser extent on warranties.''
This is not the case everywhere, however. Morinne MacDonald, of
MacDonald Henderson, has identified a greater demand for warranties
because of the recession. ''The purchaser can have no idea what they're
getting into apart from the bare company books,'' she said.
''They could end up with a 'pig in a poke' so they obtain warranties
as part of their purchase agreement. This may have become more popular
because of recessionary climate -- we've become more careful about
drawing warranties up.''
The recession has dented the confidence of Scotland's businesses.
Alastair Burrow commented: ''People here remain to be convinced that the
recession is over. In other countries people are thinking that now is
the time to grow.''
Bird Semple's clients are paying more attention to detail and taking
longer to make decisions. They are also more likely to use warranties,
although this sometimes leads to problems for the client.
Jack Gardner marks out over-anxious vendors as those most likely to
run into trouble. They may agree to warranties which they are unlikely
to be able to fulfil.
''The sophisticated buyer can tear warranties apart,'' he said, ''and
claim money back from any that can't be upheld. The unsophisticated
vendor needs a lawyer's advice. After all, he'll only sell once in a
lifetime -- we're doing it month after month.''
For both buyer and seller the best protection is to involve a lawyer
from the start. ''The main reason for bringing in a lawyer at an early
stage is so you know exactly what you are buying and all its
liabilities,'' said Mr Bruce.
''This makes sure both companies are protected in the formal sales
agreement. You don't want to sell a company for X pounds and then have
the buyer demand that money back. The seller needs legal advice to make
sure his legal documentation is correct.''
Warranties, by effectively guaranteeing a purchase, can make obtaining
finance easier. In Scotland, banks are usually able to back a good deal
when they see it.
''Banks in Scotland are not as 'sticky' as they are in England,'' said
Mr Gardner. ''If they are faced with a good proposition they are more
willing to finance it.''
John Berry of the Bank of Scotland agreed that funding was available
for strong business propositions. ''There's a lot of venture capital
money and finance from banks available just now for good quality
deals,'' he said.
For smaller firms, though, financing business propositions can be a
problem. Morinne MacDonald has noticed a ''don't put all your eggs in
one basket'' attitude.
''People are not committing to ventures -- they'll put in X amount of
money but no more. For us, this makes the viability of ventures much
more difficult to predict.''
Problems obtaining finance do not help client confidence. Corporate
lawyers are limited in the help they can provide in such a situation
but, as Miss MacDonald pointed out, clients sometimes simply need a
sympathetic ear and sound advice.
''We can be a shoulder to cry on,'' she said. ''We can do what our
clients want quickly and efficiently and we can be aware of the
pressures they're under.
''We might also be able to point them in the right direction for
outside assistance. Every lawyer should have a network of commercial and
professional contacts who could help their clients.
''You should have the kind of relationship with your lawyer, where, if
there's anything you don't understand, you can simply pick up the phone
to ask, and get advice easily and relatively inexpensively.''

UNEMPLOYMENT in the UK hit a four-year low at 2,327,900 last month,
according to figures released yesterday by the Employment Department.
The official view is that only 8.3% of the workforce is now out of a
job.
In Scotland, the seasonally-adjusted figure -- the best guide to
underlying trends -- showed that 202,600 were on the dole, a drop of
2900 on the March figure, representing 8.1% of the potential workforce
north of the border.
However, the Scottish TUC, the national TUC, and Labour spokesmen all
pointed out that the official figures masked a huge tally of uncounted
jobless. More than 30 changes have been made in the method of
calculating unemployment figures since the Conservative Government came
to power in 1979.
Mr Richard Leonard, assistant general secretary of the STUC, said the
figures ''masked the threat hanging over 1000 top-quality manufacturing
jobs in Scotland''.
He added: ''Small monthly drops in the dole queue, even on the
Government's doctored statistics, are not enough. We currently face the
prospect of losing 600 Rolls-Royce posts in East Kilbride, 500 at Dawson
International plants in Arbroath, Kilwinning, and Hawick, and 280 at
John Brown Engineering in Clydebank.
''We need a clear commitment from all parties that full employment
will be their top priority.''
TUC general secretary John Monks said the real underlying trend was
that four out of 10 of even those who showed up in Government figures
had been out of work for more than 12 months. This provided ''further
confirmation of a slowdown in the labour market's recovery''.
Long-term unemployment was now higher, he claimed, than it had been
two years ago in April, 1993.
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo welcomed the figures, saying
they were a reflection of Britain's flexible labour market. Employers
were recruiting extra people as sales and output rose.
''With the economic fundamentals in place, and growth at a sustainable
pace, our dynamic economy can deliver both prosperity and jobs,'' he
said. ''Those who predicted that economic recovery would lead to jobless
growth have been proved wrong.
''Britain now has rising exports, rising output, rising employment,
and one of the lowest unemployment rates anywhere in Europe.''
The official UK unemployment rate is 2% lower than the European Union
average but Britain is still ninth worst of the 19 countries used as a
benchmark by the Employment Department for comparative purposes.
Labour employment spokesman Ian McCartney warned last night that
insecurity at work in the UK was ''like a plague'', and said the figures
showed only that recovery was petering out. Further substantial
redundancies in banking, insurance, and other sectors of the economy
were on the way.
Mr Lex Gold, director of CBI Scotland, welcomed the apparent reduction
in the jobless total, which he said had kept Scotland ahead of the rest
of the UK so far.
''There are still too many unemployed. We will continue to pursue
policies to create the conditions for businesses to grow and prosper.
But it is important to keep unemployment on a downward trend,'' he said.

THE bid battle for Northern Electric may be about to restart if
Wyser-Pratte has its way.
The US rebel shareholder which has an interest in 985,000 Northern
shares, has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting on June 2 to
force Northern's board to allow shareholders to consider a fresh
takeover offer from shipping and construction conglomerate Trafalgar
House.
''We believe shareholders should have the opportunity to consider any
new offer from Trafalgar House as soon as possible,'' Wyser-Pratte said
in a letter to shareholders.
Shareholders will not be obliged to accept a bid from Trafalgar if
they vote for the resolution, but merely remove the current prohibition
which prevents one being made. The group also said that if a new offer
were made, Northern's board would have to give shareholders a clearer
commitment to any alternative proposals it wished to pursue.
Northern offered shareholders a package including #5.07 a share if
they turned down Trafalgar. But after a surprise announcement from
industry regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild in March, the group
said it was unable to determine to what extent it would be able to
implement the proposals.
Professor Littlechild sparked panic in the market when he said he was
reconsidering a distribution price review thought to have been agreed in
August.
As power distribution accounts for about 90% of Northern's profits its
shares plunged and Trafalgar allowed its original #11-a-share offer to
lapse, proposing #9.50 instead. (That compares with a current price of
808p.)
Northern rejected the offer saying that it undervalued the company.
However, Northern has said it would consent to a new offer from
Trafalgar once the regulator has announced his review, which is expected
by the end of June,  Wyser-Pratte believe that regulatory uncertainty is
a fact of life for regional electricity companies and should not prevent
an offer being made.
The aggressive intervention of the American investors mirrors the
high-profile campaign waged against former Saatchi and Saatchi chairman
Maurice Saatchi, by David Herro of Harris Associates, the Chicago fund
manager.

ALL eyes in the currency markets were on the French franc which
slumped in European trading.
Worries about President Chirac's commitment to a strong franc was
behind the fall. He meets German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today for their
first foreign policy meeting.
Traditionally there has been a strong linkage between the franc and
the mark. The Bundesbank is not expected to raise German interest rates
at today's monthly meeting.
Sterling recovered earlier losses against the German mark, adding
almost over a quarter-a-pfennig to DM2.2547 and was slightly ahead of
the dollar at $1.5685. Its trade-weighted index rose by 0.1 to 84.5.
Bank of England Governor Eddie George warned about the inflationary
dangers of sterling's weakness in April's monetary meeting, the minutes
of which were published yesterday.
UK labour market data was largely ignored by the markets although more
attention may be paid to today's UK retail sales for signs the economy
is slowing to a more sustainable level.

Parma 1, Juventus 1. Agg 2-1
UEFA CUP FINAL
PARMA clinched the UEFA Cup last night after a headed goal by Dino
Baggio -- before a 80,750 crowd -- secured them a 1-1 draw in a highly
charged, second-leg clash against arch Italian rivals Juventus.
Baggio scored the sole goal in the first-leg encounter two weeks ago
to give Parma overall victory 2-1 on aggregate.
Juventus dominated the match and looked set to overturn the first leg
deficit when Gianluca Vialli scored with a spectacular volley in 33
minutes.
But a combination of scrappy finishing and fine saves by Parma
goalkeeper Luca Bucci kept Juventus at bay, with the game pushed beyond
their reach in 53 minutes when Baggio headed home a cross from
substitute Roberto Mussi.
''We were lucky,'' a relieved Parma manager Nevio Scala said after a
bad-tempered match in which seven players were booked.
Italy's top two teams this season are due to meet again on Sunday,
with Juventus needing just a draw to guarantee themselves the Italian
league title. They then play each other twice more in the two-leg
Italian Cup final.

GOOD results have come from Greenalls, the pubs, off-licences and De
Vere hotels group, with profits up 21% to #39.5m in the six months to
March and the interim dividend raised 8% to 5.76p.
Chairman Andrew Thomas, attributed the figures to a strong Christmas
trade, margin improvement resulting from new beer supply agreements, an
upturn in the hotel conference and corporate market and loss elimination
in soft drinks.
''Overall I am expecting we shall make good progress for the year as a
whole,'' he said.
However, the second half would compare with a good summer performance
last year, when there was also an additional trading week.
Pub trading profits in the half-year were 10% ahead at #36m helped by
further progress in developing the Devenish estate, which is now fully
integrated.
Some 39 pubs were sold in the period and further disposals are
planned.
Mr Thomas was fully supportive of the Office of Fair Trading's inquiry
into brewers' wholesale pricing policy.
''Sir Bryan Carsberg's comments reinforce our own views on the
necessity for pub operators to provide a range of support to its
licensees in order for them to compete effectively,'' said chairman
Andrew Thomas.
Greenwalls' chain of branded pub restaurants continues to expand and
the group expects to spend #25m on acquisitions and development in the
current year to increase its share of the eating-out market.
De Vere's contribution rose by a fifth to #9.6m on the back of an
improvement in occupancy and room rates. The American hotels also
performed better.
Greenalls shares slipped 7p to 471p.

GEORGE Morris will retire as General Accident's executive
vice-chairman in the United States at the end of May and will step down
as a director of the Perth-based insurer, but he will not be replaced in
either function.
A company spokesman said another deputy to General Accident's US
chairman and chief executive, Walter Farnam, would effectively replace
Mr Morris, who has reached his contract retirement age of 65.
The new number two in the United States will be president and chief
operating officer Frank Joseph Coyne, who has been groomed for the post
in anticipation of Mr Morris's departure.
Mr Morris has been a General Accident director since 1990, but the
company spokesman said he would not be replaced because General
Accident's board traditionally only has one representative from North
American.
Recently there have been two -- Mr Farnam and Mr Morris -- but in
future, Mr Farnam alone would represent the United States. The number of
General Accident directors will fall to 14 from 15 as a result.

SCOTLAND'S financial community is set for an unprecedented era of
opportunity, Professor Jack Shaw, new chairman of Scottish Financial
Enterprise and Deputy Governor of the Bank of Scotland, said in
Edinburgh last night.
Almost treble the expected number, around 150 investors, financial
institutions, companies and intermediaries attended a special business
conference at the Royal Society in the city's George Street.
Stockbrokers Union Capital Markets (UK) staged the event which dealt
specifically with equity finance and flotation for small to medium-sized
Scottish companies.
The seminar discussed new financial initiatives, including the launch
of the Glasgow end of the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment
Arm (AIM).
The Finance and Flotation Support Programme is a new Scottish
Enterprise-funded initiative aimed at cutting the cost to companies
getting ready to seek investment finance or flotation.

MDI director Becky Donald said the venture capital firms 3i and 2M

Dunbar, but she declined to disclose their exact stakes. Lothian
Enterprise has also increased the stake it has held in MDI since 1991.
Success hinges on its ability to market and produce EasiFile, its

Pretoria
SCOTLAND manager Duncan Paterson has called for an extra 10-15% from
his side as the build-up to the Rugby World Cup begins in earnest.
The 26-strong Scotland squad and management arrived here early
yesterday morning, having shared a plane and most of the 22-hour journey
with main pool rivals France.
The Scots flew to Munich, where they were joined by the Frenchmen.
However, SRU press liaison officer Brian Meek joked that the Scottish
party had commandeered the best seats. The Scottish pool, which
includes, as well as France, Les Elephants from Ivory Coast and Tonga,
is based around this provincial city -- the administrative capital of
South Africa -- just half an hour's drive from Johannesburg.
The RWC opening ceremony, and the inaugural game, against hosts South
Africa and reigning champions Australia, takes place in Cape Town on
Thursday.
The Scots get their first taste of action the following day against
Ivory Coast in a game which is to be played at Rustenburg just a few
kilometres from their Pretoria base.
France play Tonga in Pretoria later the same day but the real test for
Scotland -- le crunch -- comes on Saturday, June 3 when, all else being
equal, the two Five Nations' rivals will contest the top pool placing.
The top side is most likely to meet Ireland or Wales thereafter with
the second-placed team likely to meet the All Blacks. The incentive for
both sides, then, will be to head the pool placings and avoid a clash
with the 1987 world champions.
Yesterday, Paterson said the aim was to build on what had already been
achieved this year. ''After having been written off at the start of the
season I think we have come a long way, but we will be hoping to find
another 10 or 15%. I believe that kind of improvement is well within the
capabilities of this squad.
''Their commitment has been first class and I can't praise them highly
enough. But we are also going to enjoy ourselves. It is the world stage
after all and the enjoyment factor is important.''
The manager added that even in the darkest hours, when the Scottish
side had gone for nine games without a win, he had never considered it
as dark as some of the critics had.
''There were a lot of results that could just as easily have gone our
way and I don't think that it was as bad as some of the critics were
making out.
Having said that, there was always the World Cup at the end of it and
I just can't give enough credit for the way that Gavin and the boys have
knuckled down and have proved a lot of people wrong.''
With eight days to go until the Scots begin their campaign for the
Webb Ellis Trophy, the management are still some time away from choosing
the side and yesterday the Scots took part in a light, 45-minute
training session at the Pretoria Harlequins ground.
The Northern Transvaal Under-15 Select Academy side -- all black
youngsters -- were interested onlookers and three among their number
were given an unexpected spot of training under the high ball.
At the close of the Scottish session the Scotland skipper scored
PR-plus points by hoisting a series of garryowens for the delighted
youngsters to catch and retrieve.
As an exercise in winning over hearts and minds it was a spectacular
success.
Hastings, in his swansong international season, is relishing the
challenge that the World Cup presents.
''We are just delighted to be here. It's not often that you get the
chance to arrive in a country nine days before the first match and so we
have plenty of time in which to prepare and we don't have to rush at
things,'' he said.

Liz Taylor discovers the benefits of working back-stage
WONDERLAND is thriving in a disused mill in Selkirk, presided over by
two very happy young men in paint-stained overalls. Its name is Border
Studio and it makes and hires out stage sets and backdrops.
The exterior gives no clue to the world of magic inside for Border
Studio is housed in a derelict looking, one-storey building that used to
be a weaving shed of Roberts' Forest Mill. When the battered wooden door
is opened however it gives access to a theatre-lover's paradise.
Hundreds of brightly painted stage sets are lined up in long rows and
it is tempting to wander up and down guessing which shows they were made
for. They are easily recognisable because most are for older musicals
like My Fair Lady and Oklahoma. Cinderella's spangled coach is pulled up
in a corner beside benches for stage lovers to sit on. A scarlet and
black demon with a wide open mouth suddenly appears when you turn a
corner and beside it is a hot chestnut seller's barrow from the set of
My Fair Lady. Some of the magic of real theatre seems to have crept into
the old mill and you can almost hear the orchestra strike up as you walk
between the towering sets.
In another part of the long shed are roof-high wooden racks packed
full of black plastic bags containing painted backcloths, each measuring
18 by 36ft. They are labelled with succinct descriptions like, A Chinese
Laundry, North Pole or Under the Sea.
The two custodians of all this treasure seem suitable subjects for a
musical themselves for they are obviously ecstatically happy in their
work. If they came out dancing between the flats, one would not be
surprised.
They are studio manager Graham Coulson and his co-artist and designer,
John Reid. Graham has worked there for nine years and John for four.
Though they occasionally take in casual labour to help when there is a
rush, for most of the year: ''There's just the two of us.''
They paint backdrops on huge frames in aniline dye and the flats are
done in what they call ''the old fashioned way'' with powder paint and
size. Both of them are loud in their praise of Mr Garner.
''We've learned such a lot from Leslie'', said John. ''When I started
I was very tentative and Leslie used to stand back and say, 'too fussy,
too fussy'. Now I know that you have to lay it on with strong strokes to
get the right effect.''
Graham joined Border Studio because he was fed up with his job as a
laboratory technician in Galashiels Academy and he recruited John. John
had qualified at Glasgow School of Art and found a job in Selkirk in a
firm making embroidered and woven textiles. Because he knew no one in
the town, he joined the local dramatic society in an effort to make
friends. There he met Graham who is a keen amateur actor.
When business in Border Studio began getting very busy about five
years ago, Graham remembered John and, though he had left Selkirk by
that time, tracked him down and offered him a job.
John was also soon bitten by the thespian bug and both he and Graham
now appear regularly in local shows, most recently this year in
Brigadoon at Hawick and the Merry Widow in Selkirk. Not only did they
act in the shows but they supplied the stage sets as well.
Border Studio has been in existence since 1950 though until just over
a year ago, it was housed in different premises in Selkirk. It was
started by a scenic artist called Leslie Garner who worked for Moss
Empires in London and had painted scenery for such successful shows as
Ivor Novello's Dancing Years.
Paintings of the sets he worked on in London hang on the wall of
Border Studio's little office. One of them, a masterly watercolour, is
by Novello himself.
When he married a girl from Selkirk, Mr Garner moved north and started
his own business making scenery for small companies who did not have the
resources to make their own. Now 74, he retired last year and passed the
ownership of the studio onto his daughter Kate who lives in Bristol.
She, in turn, passed on the responsibility for its running to Graham who
says that in the eight years he has worked there business has
quintupled.
''We have benefitted because people are cutting back on expenses.
Scenery used to be made and then scrapped when a show was over but now
companies prefer to hire from us.
''Our business basically has two sides. First, we supply stage sets
for small companies in towns ranging from Tain in Rossshire to Helston
in Cornwall . . . '' ''And in the Republic of Ireland,'' chimed in John.
''And secondly we supply backdrops. We have over 900 in stock and send
out a catalogue listing them, with some illustrations, so that people
can pick the one they want. We are the only company in Scotland doing
this.''
Their most far-reaching commission so far came from a lady in
Knutsford who was putting on a programme of excerpts from opera in
Jakarta. She phoned out of the blue one day to say that she arranges
opera and concerts for embassies and consulates throughout the world,
and had been told about Graham and Border Studio by the manager of the
Sheraton Hotel in Dubai -- who was a customer when he managed the
Sheraton Hotel in Edinburgh.
They sent her scenery for Aida and Tosca and a backcloth for a garden
in Spain and are awaiting another order soon.
The cost of hiring stage scenery and backcloths is very reasonable.
''The Merry Widow is a three act play, and we can supply the scenery for
10 days for #300. If the show's more complicated, like Fiddler on the
Roof, which has several different scenes, the cost would be #675,'' said
Graham.
Border Studio provides stage sets for all the local amateur companies,
and some of them come twice a year because they do a mid-year show and a
pantomime.
In Glasgow their customers include the Pantheon Club for smaller shows
(Cinderella's coach was made for them); Glasgow Theatre Productions
South; Glasgow Airport Drama Club; the Harlequin Youth Theatre; Eastwood
Entertainers and clubs and repertory companies in Johnstone, East
Kilbride, and Clydebank.

RANGERS are close to making their first major signing of the close
season -- and it isn't yet Paul Gascoigne. The Scottish champions are
now on the verge of completing a deal for the Romanian World Cup striker
Florin Raducioiu, who moved to Spain from Milan last close season.
The 25-year-old is valued at around #2m and Rangers are tipped to sign
him within the next few days.
There have been suggestions already that he is one of the players
Ibrox manager Walter Smith had wanted. He is certainly one of the
players Rangers have watched over the last months as they prepared to
rebuild their championship winning side.
Yesterday, Smith was not at Ibrox, which fuelled suggestions that the
deal could be completed very soon.
The 25-year-old Raducioiu, who scored four goals for his country
during last summer's World Cup including the one against Sweden that
sent the quarter-final tie into extra time, went to Espanol from AC
Milan for #1.4m last year. He had been on Paris St Germain's wanted list
last month as a replacement for George Weah, and the irony of that will
not be lost at Celtic Park, where their bid for Belgian striker Marc
Degryse looks like being lost -- to the French club.
Reports also suggest 21-year-old Swede Jesper Blomqvist, who has been
linked with Rangers for some weeks, also may be close to signing from
Gothenburg.
On the Gascoigne front, Lazio are apparently ready to agree the
compensation deal with the player for the remaining years of his
contract with the Rome club. That will leave the England international
star free to negotiate with any club, including Rangers.
Celtic, meanwhile, are virtually certain to miss out on Degryse as a
result of manoeuvrings on the continent triggered by the #7.3m agreement
between the French club and AC Milan for the transfer of their exciting
African striker, Weah.
That move, allied to their spell in the Champions' League, will
finance any dealings that PSG have in mind, and they had already set in
motion their bid to beat Celtic for the Belgian star's signature.
Degryse is seen as an immediate and experienced replacement for Weah,
whose departure from Paris will not be taken kindly by his multitude of
fans.
Celtic dealings have yet to match the personal terms wanted by Degryse
who, reputedly, earns #7000 a week and, naturally, does not intend to
move for a lower figure.
It has always been debatable if the Parkhead club would match his
ideas in that direction but Paris St Germain are prepared to offer a
package of #3.5m, which would give Degryse around #2m as part of his
share in the transfer.
Degryse's representative has had talks with Celtic chairman Fergus
McCann, but the gap between Celtic's offer and the player's salary scale
remained unbridged. Degryse already earns more than than any current
Celtic player and McCann would have to come up with an imaginative
package deal to circumvent that potential problem.
Now it seems as if it could be too late anyway. Degryse said last week
that the difference between what he wanted and what Celtic were offering
was ''40-50%''.
Celtic, who are in Milan on a pre-final break, have finalised plans
for their pre-season trip in July. They will play four games in Germany,
leaving on July 20 to face amateur sides VFB Luebeck and SV
Wilhelmshaven, as well as second divison clubs St Pauli and Kickers
Emden.
St Pauli fans, who apparently have adopted Celtic as their second
team, will be enthusiastic about the visit. Celtic fly back on July 27,
then travel to face Birmingham City two days later.
* HEARTS may get a bonus they did not expect if Jim Bett decides to
stay another season at Tynecastle. The former Aberdeen man is leaning
that way after the club secured its premier division future by beating
Motherwell last Saturday, but will not make any decision for a couple of
weeks.

THE work of the lawyer is not necessarily over when the sale of a
company is completed. Problems can arise if the new owners want to
change staff or conditions of employment.
What governs what they can or cannot do is legislation which lawyers
tend to refer to as TUPE. It's official name is the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, 1981.
Under these regulations the employees' Contracts of Employment are
automatically transferred to the new owners. Consultations with workers'
representatives must take place before any transfer, with a view to
reaching agreement about changing conditions.
Dismissal connected to the transfer will generally be regarded as
unfair and can result in court action. This is where the firm needs a
lawyer to highlight the pitfalls in changing conditions of employment to
limit possible damage resulting from claims.
''In looking at any business it is vital that prospective purchasers
are aware of the fact that they will almost inevitably take on a
liability for any dismissal carried out around the time of the
transfer,'' said Robert Gall of Boyd's in Glasgow.
''It is therefore essential to obtain a full list of employees, full
and part-time, with details of their starting dates and ages, to allow
possible provision to be made for any such claims.''
Allowing provision for claims is effectively the best defence against
them. Alastair Burrow of McClure, Naismith, Anderson and Gardner, said:
''Generally agreements will be reached between the buyer and seller
prior to the actual sale about who will accept responsibility for any
claims.
''It is then up to the responsible party to make provision for them.''
Much of MacDonald Henderson's work involves ''cost-cutting'',
particularly in the area of redundancies. Morinne MacDonald, said: ''In
most circumstances the big word is 'consultation' -- keeping the
workforce advised.
''Some companies will form 'workers' committees' where one or more
workers will be delegated to act as 'conduits of information' for the
rest.''
There is some added protection against claims in the current shape of
the British economy. ''The job market at the moment is such that people
are nervous about leaving work and undertaking legal action,'' said Jack
Gardner, of Bird Semple.
Despite this the number of court cases for unfair dismissal continues
to rise and looks set to continue to do so. In fact some believe that
TUPE is having the opposite effect from what was intended.
''The Transfer of Undertaking Regulations were clearly intended to
protect employment in the context of the sale of businesses,'' said
Brian Dorman, of Dorman Jeffrey.
''In fact, the tendency has been the reverse, and particularly with
the recent court decision by which a receiver could be personally
reliable to continue employment if he keeps people on for more than 14
days after the date of receivership.
''That means if the receiver cannot tell a business within 14 days he
will close it down.''
Robert Gall summed up the situation when he said: ''In general this is
a fast developing and altering area of law. Employers and those looking
to expand their businesses require to consult their advisers and focus
carefully on this area.''

BOLTON match-winner John McGinlay accepted he had been lucky to still
be on the pitch to score the goal which sent the Burnden Park side to
Wembley for the first division play-offs.
The Scottish striker, whose goal against Swindon had given Bolton
their place in last month's Coca-Cola Cup final, pegged back Wolves' 2-1
first-leg advantage a minute before half-time.
No further goals meant the match went into an extra 30 minutes and
within 100 seconds of the restart a goalmouth fracas ended with the Scot
sending David Kelly crashing to the ground with a left hook.
Referee Steve Dunn showed McGinlay a yellow card and he made the most
of his escape by lashing in his second of the night and twenty-second of
the season in 109 minutes to ensure Bolton's 3-2 aggregate triumph.
McGinlay admitted: ''Maybe I should have gone off and I've got to
count myself fortunate to have stayed on.''
Bolton now meet Reading at Wembley on May 29. A goalless draw with
Tranmere was enough to put them through after their 3-1 win at Prenton
Park and they fly to Lanzarote this morning for a week's
holiday-cum-training.
Mick Gooding, the player-manager, said: ''I've told the lads that if
anyone is sober getting on the plane tomorrow they're in trouble.''
In the second-division play-off final, Huddersfield will meet Bristol
Rovers.
Huddersfield won on a penalty shoot-out, and assistant manager Mick
Jones said: ''It would have been nice to go up as champions, but doing
it by winning at Wembley would be a nice second best.''
Bristol manager John Ward saluted his troops after a victory against
Crewe on away goals. Paul Miller's strike in extra time took them
through after substitute Darren Rowbotham had put Crewe ahead in the 1-1
outcome after a 0-0 first leg.
Ward said: ''I've been in the game for nearly 24 years and I have
never experienced a moment like this.''
The third division play-off final will be contested by Bury and
Chesterfield.
Chesterfield manager John Duncan described his side's 5-2 victory over
local rivals Mansfield as ''one of the greatest games I have ever been
involved in''. His side twice came back from a goal down to secure their
final place in extra time.
Referee Clive Wilkes sent off two Mansfield players and awarded a
controversial penalty which allowed Chesterfield to take the lead in 95
minutes.
Bury reached the final with a 1-0 win at home to Preston, and 2-0 on
aggregate. A goal three minutes from the end by Tony Rigby decided the
issue.

DESPITE the much-trumpeted attractions of peripheral developments,
Glasgow's city centre is firmly re-establishing itself as a ''downtown''
office district.
The last two decades saw a drift away from the city centre as
developers sought sites which offered large floorplates, good parking,
and modern buildings. This created a pull in two directions: westwards
over Blythswood Hill towards the M8, and southwards towards the Clyde.
But in a quiet revolution, occupiers have started to move right back
into the centre.
The opportunity for a return to downtown locations is coming from the
refurbishment or redevelopment of redundant buildings, many of which are
1960s-style concrete horrors which the city will be well rid off.
Friends Provident has consent for a 90,000 sq ft replacement of Alhambra
House on Waterloo Street; Scottish Amicable has applied for consent for
a 77,000 sq ft redevelopment at Ashley House on West George St; and
Scottish Life House at 48 St Vincent Street is being redeveloped to
bring it up to modern standards.
Agents in the city are confident that modern space in the traditional
heart of the city will find occupiers, despite the rivalry from business
parks and other peripheral schemes. Is ''central Glasgow'' shrinking
into a more compact core? ''Larger space users want to go downtown
nowadays,'' says Mike Ryder of surveyors Lambert Smith Hampton. ''Some
of them have tried fringe locations such as the Broomielaw, often
because they could not get large floorplates or modern space right in
the city centre. But they now have that choice in the centre.''
He adds that current redevelopments such as the Post Office building
in George Square create ''very exciting'' opportunities for the city's
property sector. The 120,000 sq ft building will offer floorplates of
around 34,000 sq ft. ''By anyone's standards, those are big plates. It
means that an occupier can get as much space on a single floor as they
can find in the whole of a traditional West George Street or St Vincent
Street building. Big, modern space is now available in the traditional
heart of Glasgow,'' says Ryder.
He predicts that occupiers seeking modern space who don't need to be
in the city centre will leapfrog central fringe schemes and head for the
new business parks on the edge of town. ''You can drive from the
business park at Cardonald to the city centre as quickly as you can walk
up from the Broomielaw,'' he says.
Bill Colville of surveyors DTZ Debenham Thorpe concurs: ''Glasgow is
seeing a steady return to the traditional values of location. The city
centre offers amenities for staff which you can't get on the
periphery.'' He says that the glut of unwanted modern buildings from the
1960s and 1970s offers a great opportunity for redevelopment in the city
centre. Their owners face the stark choice of either selling to someone
who will carry out a redevelopment, or of spending cash to modernise the
buildings themselves.
Recent redevelopments and refurbishments like 130 St Vincent Street,
163 West George Street, and Delta House on West Nile Street, have all
attracted tenants. ''Office users don't want to be located on the wrong
side of Blythswood Hill any more. In fact, there is an increasing
feeling that even Blythswood Square itself is too far from the city
centre,'' says Bill Colville.

ACCORDING to Handout Henry the really interesting thing about the
forthcoming, or very recent, nuptials -- depending on the paper of your
choice -- of Imran Khan and Miss Jemima Goldsmith is that their
betrothal was announced to the world by a public relations firm. Henry,
who will do a campaign for you at the drop of a G &amp;T, seems to think
that this has given his strange trade a special cachet.
''It just goes to show,'' he said in McSonachan's last night, ''that
we have an essential function to perform in society at the highest
level. Sports stars, millionaires, heiresses -- we move in these circles
all the time, lubricating the wheels of the information machine. We are
the professionals. If you want to say anything, let us say it for you
and the world will listen. That's my advice.''
The Braces, whose opinion of the PR industry equates with the opinion
of a turkey contemplating Christmas, took a pull at his draught 90
shilling and burped belligerently. I could tell there was going to be an
interesting discussion here. I move one pace back, out of the line of
fire. I ordered a round to lubricate the wheels of debate, and listened
intently. This is how it went.
Braces: ''Come come, Henry. You can't be that essential. Are you
saying that Mr Imran Khan should have used a PR firm to propose to Miss
Jemima Goldsmith? Should we have received a fax message headed 'For
Immediate Release: Eligible Cricketing Bachelor Proposes to Top
Heiress'?''
Henry: ''Absolutely not, Braces. You're being ridiculous. But at the
same time, it wouldn't have been unreasonable for Mr Khan to consult a
PR specialist on certain aspects of his campaign. We could have advised
on the appropriate moment to launch the proposal, and gone back to our
hotel room with our laptop to devise a suitable form of words. We can be
as discreet as any lawyer, when discretion is required.''
Braces: ''So you're saying that if -- heaven forbid -- Mr IMran Khan's
proposal had been rejected by Miss Jemima Goldsmith, then the whole
thing would have been swept under the media carpet? We wouldn't have
known anything about it?
Henry: ''Exactly. There would have been nothing 'For Immediate
Release' -- The PR company would simply have folded its tents and stolen
silently away. These things happen all the time. It's part of the
business.''
Braces: ''Wait a minute though. I suspect that a fax message headed
'Eligible Cricketing Bachelor Rejected by Top Heiress' would have
created an even bigger media stir. But in many ways, the result would
have been the same. We would have been reminded about Mr Imran Khan, and
we would have heard -- possibly for the first time -- of Miss Jemima
Goldsmith.''
Henry: ''I can't argue with that. But surely it undermines the point
you seem to be making: that the public relations industry has no useful
function. Take me for example . . .''
It was at this point that I decided to slink away, to go home and
watch television or something. The awful thing is that Handout Henry and
The Braces didn't even notice.
* At Nerd House, we have a highly specialised character whose job is
to write the small print at the end of any contract we draw up, so that
the party of the first part doesn't understand a word of it until we go
to court. But now he's worried. There's a new European Union directive
coming into force in July designed to make this well-honed technique
untenable.
I met Small Print Sam in the third-floor gents' the other day. ''How's
it going?'' I asked.
He replied thus: ''Inasmuch as, and without prejudice to the
heretofore, no binding agreement has been entered into on this or any
other subject between the parties who may or may not be contracting to
discuss the issue stated above, it's going pretty duff.''
I was sorry to hear that, whatever it meant. He then told me about the
European Union directive, and how it was going to affect job security in
the small print sector. I had no idea, he said, how many people were
going to be out of work as a result: him for a start. But surely, I
said, there will still be a requirement for writing the small print on
contracts. It would just be a matter of using shorter sentences.
''Where 'shorter' means 'less long' as defined by the Geneva Sentence
Agreement of 1904,'' he began, ''and where 'sentence' includes an
object, a subject and a verb as established by . . .'' I think he's
still standing there, talking away.

Andy Murray discovers a Borders village which is the Scottish base for
an outdoor classic.
THE village of Newcastleton in the Scottish Borders is famous for its
folk festival, which lures entertainers from throughout the Celtic
fringe.
The village was also once famous for the locally manufactured town and
country bags which were sent to the Far East. Ninety per cent of the
production of the Liddesdale Fishing Bag Company went to one firm in
Japan and there was an 18-month waiting list.
The firm was taken over by Barbour in 1982, and now the village is
famous as being the only place in Scotland where Barbour jackets are
made.
One of the wettest Marches on record has produced a jump in production
at Newcastleton -- from 600 jackets to 800 a week. The 55 people in the
factory make the medium-weight Bedale jacket, which is the second-most
ubiquitous Barbour jacket.
If you ask Dave Myers, the general manager at Liddesdale, why you
should pay three times as much for a Barbour as you would for a cheaper
imitation, he looks at you as if you are a court jester.
He will reply that some people have had their Barbour jackets since
before The Beatles made their names. All they need is a yearly
re-proofing and a bit of care.
He produces sales literature which informs that Barbour jackets are
like a good wine. They improve with age and can become like an old
friend. The literature quotes an ageing member of the gentry as saying
that he may have had his Barbour since 1936. ''I seem to remember it
cost about #5 five shillings. So you may be able to date it,'' he tells
Barbour.
''Let me say that I have no intention whatever of buying a new jacket.
I am now 84 and, as I said, it will last the rest of my life as it is
perfectly waterproof. However, if it can be renovated at a reasonable
price I would like to have it done.''
A Geordie Kidson from Powys in Wales says of his family's Barbours:
''Their march towards 30 years of hard service must constitute some kind
of record. I have no plans for replacing them.''
The marketing department also cites incidents where Barbour jackets
have saved people in distress from hypothermia. Moreover a Mr Snelling
found his Barbour eight months after losing it overboard in Lake
Windermere. He hosed it down and re-proofed it. And a Barbour jacket
saved a Mr King of Bulawayo from serious injury when a zebra attacked
him.
Given the nature of the testimonials it is hardly worth Dave Myers
talking about the 15,000 stitches that go into a Barbour thornproof and
the fact that the threads are steeped in oil and that all the seams are
double-turned for total waterproofing.
''Why pay #40 for a jacket that is only going to last you for a couple
of years before it starts leaking or falling apart?'' he asks. ''No, the
Barbour success has not been affected by the many lookalikes on the
market. Everybody knows how good they are -- from Japan to Iceland.''
Indeed, Barbour is known throughout the world for its quality and a
recession failed to dent sales, particularly in Italy, where Barbour
thornproof jackets are displayed alongside goods from Christian Dior and
Jaeger in boutique windows.
''We despatch to the four corners of the globe from our head office in
South Shields,'' says Myers.
''Last year Barbours won the Queen's Award for exporting for the
second year running. Although Barbours are worn mainly by hunting,
fishing, and shooting people in Britain, they are a fashion element in
the likes of Italy.
''If you watch the Italian league football on Channel Four you will
probably spot somebody at the sideline wearing a Barbour.''
Italy is by far the main country to which Barbours are exported but
the jackets go right around the world.
''The company has had several requests from the Royal Family,
particularly with the royal children growing up. We have the three Royal
Warrants, which means our products have to be worn on a regular basis by
them,'' adds Myers.
''Pavarotti is one of our famous outsize customers and when Prince
Charles fell while playing polo we made him a special one-armed
jacket.''
Royal warrants from the Queen, Prince Philip, and Prince Charles are a
far cry from the year 1870 when John Barbour, a 21-year-old from
Kirkcudbrightshire, set up as a travelling draper on Tyneside.
Barbour moved to South Shields in 1894 and established J Barbour &amp; Co.
It was his son Malcolm who established the principle of oilskin wear for
outdoor people.
J Barbour &amp; Sons Limited was formed in 1912, and it is still trading
under that name to this day. It has been hugely profitable apart from
during the years of the Depression.
The introduction of thornproof clothing and suits for motorcyclists
formed the basis of the company's success in the late 1930s.
The precursor to barbour (Liddesdale) Limited in Newcastleton was the
Liddesdale Fishing Bag Company, which was formed in the village in 1978.
Housed in the old manse in Douglas Square the factory produced
top-quality bags, which are still greatly sought-after.
Jim Robson, company secretary of Barbour (Liddesdale) Limited, is in
with bricks. He recalls: ''The company started in a very, very small
way, but the quality of the bags attracted many customers.
''Believe it or not, 90% of our total production went to one firm in
Japan. It was colossal. Somebody had seen our bags at one of the trade
exhibitions and liked the look of them.
''A director of the company asked us to make a music case for his
daughter. We saw the possibility of it being a stylish brief case.
''We sent one out to Japan and the resultant orders kept us going
literally. They were wanting them in their hundreds. Our fishing bags
were the Rolls Royce of fishing bags.''
The bags were named after local historical or topographical features
such as Tarras moor, Glenzier, Cheviot, Reiver and Eskdale.
Barbours took over the company in February 1982 so that they could use
the range of town and country bags as a back-up to the products they
made.
Bags are now made in South Shields and they go all over the world.
Only Bedale jackets are made at Newcastleton.
''At Douglas Square the upstairs rooms were for production. The loft
was the mechanic's workshop,'' says Dave Myers. ''The cycle shed and a
portable building were used for storage.
''This factory has let us have everything on the one level and
manufacturing and despatch is carried out in an identical manner to the
others in the group.
''The number of employees has gone up from 30 to 55 and we produce 800
units a week. The people have job security and they spend their money in
the locality.''

A SEASON which just a few weeks ago seemed to be heading for a chaotic
end has reached its climax more or less on the appointed hour, with two
major finals this weekend clearing the decks for the Glenmorangie
Camanachd Cup final in a fortnight's time.
In the south, Oban Camanachd hope to continue re-writing the record
books of the Bank of Scotland Celtic Society Cup when they tackle
Inveraray at the Strathclyde Police Recreation Ground, in Pollok Park,
Glasgow.
Oban are bidding for their ninth successive title and their opponents
will be appearing in the final for the first time since 1974. Oban's
dreams of a grand slam are now gone, but this is the third of four major
finals they will have contested by the time the season draws to a close.
Inveraray could, however, be a huge stumbling block.
In the national league final last weekend Oban had a major problem in
midfield and in attack against Kingussie.
For all that the match itself is important, its significance this year
perhaps lies in the fact that Oban will have to use it to try to regain
some of the bite they have been missing in attack before they face
Kingussie again in a fortnight's time.
In the north, Kingussie's domination of the MacTavish Cup has been
almost as total, winning the past seven on the trot. They are now almost
within reach of Newtonmore's record of 10 in a row in the seventies, and
are also tackling this final with the Camanachd Cup very much in mind.
But for Fort William it is the last throw of the dice in a season which
promised much but has yielded little, apart from a second place spot in
the first division.
Fort can take heart form the fact that the last time they met
Kingussie on the Bught at Inverness, they despatched them with
astonishing ease from the MacAulay Cup. Since then though, normal
service has been resumed and Kingussie were easy winners in the
Camanachd Cup semi-final.
The arrangements for the game's showpiece event, the Camanachd Cup
final in Oban on June 3, have been changed to accommodate Scotland's
efforts in the Rugby World Cup.
The Camanachd Cup final start has been brought forward from 2.30 to
2pm to enable the BBC to broadcast it live. Otherwise it would have
overlapped into the BBC coverage of the start of Scotland's crucial
World Cup match against France in South Africa.

THE invention of the digital computer a century ago owed its
inspiration to the punched cards used to regulate the weaving processes
of the Nineteenth century loom. Yet, till now, despite their vital
contribution to almost every aspect of modern western economies, there
was one unlit corner of manufacturing where the marvels of the computer
were quite unknown.
And that dim corner was, ironically, in one sector of the textile
industry -- in the manufacture of traditional cotton lace, where the
punch cards used on the Nottingham and Levers looms still had to be made
by hand, in an antiquated, tedious and time-consuming process.
However, those nineteenth century methods of the lace manufacturers
can now be revolutionised. Orion Design of Glasgow has invented a
machine which takes the drudgery out of the process by using computer
aided design (CAD) to convert the artist's drawings into the
sophisticated and complex instructions for the punchcards used on the
looms.
Two brothers, Paul and Martin Donoghue, are the trailblazing inventors
of this machine. In February they were awarded #3750 from The Glasgow
Innovation Fund for their imaginative and innovative use of the CAD
System which they combined with a Jacquard punching card machine. The
new machine, the only one of its kind in Britain, has already been sold
to a traditional lace manufacturer in Nottingham who is delighted with
the radical impact it has made on his business.
As in almost all consumer goods areas, the tide of fashion sweeps in
and out ever more quickly. Even though Nottingham lace and Levers lace
is a very traditional material -- two different types of machines make
the finest 100% cotton yarn into high quality, delicately patterned and
textured curtains, tablecloths, and ladies' underwear -- it is just as
vital to keep abreast of new fashions. The industry is competing with
man-made nylon and terylene, mass-produced in a far less sophisticated
process; and over the years, because of its antiquated methods, the
traditional lace industry has steadily declined.
Now, at last, the Nottingham lace manufacturer can compete on equal
terms with his modern rival, maker of man-made substitutes. With a
high-quality product, made from CAD produced designs which can
dramatically speed up the design process, he can manufacture a much
greater variety of lace far more efficiently and sell to a world-wide
market.
Instead of taking three or four months, the use of the Orion machine
has decreased the time from initial design to production of the lace to
three or four weeks.
Now that the Donoghues' first machine is sold, marketing on a wider
scale can begin. There are two areas of lace making in Britain -- around
Nottingham and in Ayrshire -- and manufacturers in both are showing keen
interest.

HAVE YOU ever met a property developer? If you haven't (or perhaps
even if you have), the chances are that your mental image of a developer
is a ''Gordon Gekko'' type with slicked back hair, red braces, sporting
a flashy suit, too much gold jewellery and a cell phone clamped to his
ear.
The archetypal property developer gives the impression of a used car
salesman who has made it -- someone renowned for firm views on almost
everything -- apart from business ethics.
It pains me to admit it but there is an element of truth in this
stereotype, although such characters were very much an Eighties
phenomenon. Like many other successful species before them, when their
environment changed in the first half of this decade, they failed to
change with it and are now all but extinct in the cost-driven Nineties.
While the Barings Bank debacle highlights what can go wrong when
speculative activity gets out of control, the vast majority of the 4000
people employed at Barings were not employed to speculate on futures or
derivatives.
In the same way, many in the property development industry may be
involved in making judgments about the market, but they are not pure
speculators who add nothing to the process of development.
There is great ignorance, even in the business community, about what
developers actually do and no discussion of whether their role has any
value in the community. If we can see past the stereotype, I think we
can begin to understand the contribution that developers do make.
On the face of it, the developer's life appears simple and easy. Just
acquire some land, obtain planning permission and develop the product.
Then lease it and sell it as an investment or sell directly to an
owner-occupier.
It is anything but simple. Consider the average two-year period
between conceiving the product and bringing it to market. The developer
has to make a judgment at the outset about the likely price for the
product. For example, the value of a typical retail product between June
1994 and December 1994 probably dropped by around 15%. That six-month
movement is enough to completely wipe out a developer's profit on a
project that may have been worked on for two to three years.
The final cost of the product will be determined by unpredictable
variables such as changing design, the weather and ground conditions.
Any or all of these can combine to force costs up by 20%, 30% or even
more, again wiping out profits.
Soon after completion, the developer pays rates on a building whether
it is occupied or not but an obvious haste to find a tenant is
compromised by the need to balance a tenant's requirements, ie the
lowest possible rent, with a future owner's requirement of the highest
possible return over the longest period of time.
I believe that developers, although unpopular, fulfil a very necessary
function. Any city is like a living organism; at any time there are
parts where cells are dying and parts where new cells are being built.
This natural process of decay, death, and rebirth is happening all the
time as social trends change human activity and affect accommodation
needs.
As existing accommodation decays or becomes functionally obsolete, it
needs to be replaced. The developer is an agent of change, identifying
those parts of a city that have potential for change and then securing
the necessary capital and political support to bring those changes
about.
In the past, we have fallen into the trap of believing that if we zone
our cities and lay down an elaborate planning system, we will achieve a
means of providing for growth and regeneration.
The truth is that plans alone will not suffice because they are
static, are born of conventional wisdom, don't adjust to the changing
needs of the community they serve, and don't necessarily attract the
money required to create change.
It is the combination of a planning strategy and the willingness of
developers to speculate time, effort, and capital in making change come
about that provides for growth and renewal.
In the Nineties, with low inflation and no windfall gains, the
development business is much more akin to other enterprises in which
modest returns are available for well-managed, professionally run
businesses with an eye on minimising costs.
In the 1990s, returns from development activity don't justify the sort
of risks that were taken in the 1980s and so the whole development
process has slowed down.
However, the process of change is never ending and as the supply of
accommodation dwindles or becomes obsolete and the demand for
appropriate accommodation begins to build, probably towards the end of
this decade, we can expect to see a return of the men (or women) in
braces.
In the meantime, spare a thought for the much maligned agent of
change, more likely now to be seen in a Granada than a Range Rover,
sporting a Marks &amp; Spencer's suit with the only sign of latent
entrepreneurial spirit being the slightly less than tasteful silk tie
and matching handkerchief.
* Phil Miller, managing director of Miller Developments, the
commercial development arm of the Miller Group, was talking to Yvonne
Wightman.

ABERDEEN captain Stewart McKimmie yesterday backed Roy Aitken to
resurrect the Pittodrie side as a major power in Scotland.
The international defender credits the acting Aberdeen manager for
turning the Dons from a bunch of slackers into survival experts. ''Roy
is the man for the job and I would be happy to play under him,'' he
said.
''You must hand it to him for turning the club around. Before he took
over we had become lazy, both mentally and physically. We were not
giving 100%.
''We had been going out expecting things to happen and when they
didn't, fear crept into our game.
''One of the first things Roy did was to work us hard in training. We
soon realised that we had no divine right to expect teams to lie down
before us. The players have responded to his methods and we know now
that we have to graft first and then let our ability come through.
''He has also let players express themselves. You only have to look at
how Joe Miller and Peter Hetherston have performed recently to
appreciate the difference now. They have proved what good players they
are and will be for Aberdeen. There was also a lack of self-belief
before, but our confidence is back.
''To be honest, the play-offs are a bit of a downer after beating
Falkirk last week. We were greedy and thought that would be enough to
save us. But a month ago we would have snapped anyone's arm off to have
the chance of a play-off.
''I know it will be very difficult against Dunfermline. They always
presented problems for us when they were in the premier division. They
are on an unbeaten 15-game run but, if we show the same commitment, we
will get through.
''I have never known anything like what has taken place during our
revival in these last few weeks and it is all down to our fans.
''It started when they applauded us off Pittodrie despite being beaten
by Kilmarnock. They knew that we could not have done more for the cause.
''Since then it is quite incredible the backing they have given us.
They have demonstrated how important the club is to them and the city.
''This has helped our recovery and in recent weeks it has been more
enjoyable for me than at any time in my career -- even when I was
winning cups and leagues. We cannot fail them now.''

HAVING spent a lifetime in the army, Peter Bishop went back to school
last year.
''I had to repackage my skills for the commercial world,'' explains
Peter, who joined the infantry as a boy soldier and rose through the
ranks to become a Lieutenant Colonel.
The repackaging exercise obviously worked as Peter now finds himself
the managing director of Challenger UK, the Glasgow-based management
training firm.
The job means that Peter has to commute between his home in Kent and
Glasgow every week but the travel does not worry him as during his army
career he grew accustomed to moving about.
The first Challenger Trophy was launched in 1986 by Michael Malschaert
in Spa, Belgium but in 1990 the concept was brought to the UK with a
large-scale event in 1990.
''Michael Malschaert was inspired by the Paris-Dakka Rally to develop
the concept of a Challenger event in which teams from different
companies compete against each other,'' says Peter.
Last year 112 teams entered the three-day event to compete for the
Mitel Telecom Challengers Trophy, and says Peter, ''more than 70 have
already signed up for this year's competition which takes place in July
at Wellington College, near Bracknell''.
Companies pay #1000 per person for each member of their four-person
team with two supporters who can be used as substitutes.
Household names such as Mobil Oil, United Distillers, Reuters, and
Avon Cosmetics have taken part in past Challenger events and this year a
number of Scottish companies will be taking part including Railtrack
Scotland, Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, and Renfrewshire Enterprise.
''It is great fun,'' says Peter, ''but it also has a very serious side
to it as part of a company's management training and personal
development programmes''.
There is also an additional spin off from the Challenger UK event. A
deserving cause benefits as many of the teams seek sponsors, and last
year the Spastics Society gained more than #100,000 from the event.
This year NCH Action for Children is the official charity, and is
obviously hoping that the teams taking part will repeat last year's
charitable efforts.

Harry Conroy uncovers a plot to promote Scotland as a first-rate
location for filming during the silver screen industry's biggest and
most glamorous festival.
REPRESENTATIVES from Scotland's embryonic film industry will be in
Cannes for the next fortnight fighting for a big-screen break. They will
be rubbing shoulders with around 20,000 international film industry
executives, who are in the South of France glamour resort to do serious
business.
The public face of the Cannes Film Festival may be shots of various
starlets each trying to grab the attention of photographers by wearing
the minimum amount required while still laying claim to being dressed.
The Wonderbra, or equivalents, will do their best for competing
cleavages but behind the glitz serious business will be done, and the
groundwork laid for film deals running into many millions.
For the fifth time since its formation in 1990, Scottish Screen
Locations will have a presence at the Cannes Film Festival
Its Scottish Screen stand within the European Pavilion will be a
contact point for the Scottish contingent who this week will be making
their separate ways to the South of France.
This year it will hope to benefit from arrival of Rob Roy on cinema
screens on both sides of the Atlantic and the success of Shallow Grave.
As a country, Scotland now appears to be making some inroads into the
movie industry. In Scottish Screen Locations' first year of operation
they brought #3.8m into the country. This doubled in 1992 and in 1993
the figure passed #10m. Last year the spend by film companies in
Scotland was a staggering #22.9m.
The recently appointed director of Scottish Screen Locations, Celia
Stevenson, hopes to be able to cash in on the new ''global awareness''
of Scotland.
Celia, who was until a few weeks ago Head of Programme Planning and
Acquisitions at Scottish Television, says: ''With Rob Roy and Braveheart
we are the flavour of the month but we have more to offer than
historical Scottish films.''
Some may wonder what Scotland has to offer other than beautiful
scenery which after all, dare I say it, other countries also have.
Our ability to provide empty skies -- devoid of jet aircraft vapour
trails -- is highly valued in the movie world where a scene depicting a
horse drawn carriage could be destroyed by a jet stream across the sky
in the background.
At the same time as film makers want to avoid pylons, traffic noise,
and the like, they also require certain types of locations. When Mission
Impossible was being made they were looking for a long stretch of
railway line which Scottish Screen Locations could direct them towards
near Annan in Dumfrieshire.
''We maintain a photographic library currently standing at 17,000
locations, and will eventually grow to 50,000. Our staff personally
visit each of these locations to ensure that the details we hold are
accurate,'' explains Celia Stevenson.
Among the other Scots travelling to Cannes this week is film producer
Peter Broughan of Bronco Films who put together the Rob Roy film
project.
I spoke to Peter at the weekend as he was preparing to go through to
Edinburgh for the Scottish premiere of the film.
It took Peter, who is based in Balfron, more than four years to take
Rob Roy from the idea stage to production and he is constantly working
on new ideas.
''I am working on four major projects at the moment. One of these will
definitely come to fruition, and the other three are likely. It normally
takes at least three years to bring a project to the production stage.''
Peter Broughan is hopeful that his visit to Cannes will further his
projects one of which will involve filming in Scotland.
He admits that he would find it easier to be based in America but says
that at present he chooses to live and work in Scotland.
''I spend a lot of time in America,'' Peter explains ''but I choose to
live in Scotland, after all the world is quite a small place. It does
not take that long to get to Los Angeles.''
Peter is pessimistic about the prospects of Scotland developing its
full potential as a film making centre saying.
''I think it depends how much more control Scotland gets over its own
institutions, and a bigger slice of the cake from the national
broadcasting channels.''
Among the other Scots heading for Cannes is Bill Mathieson, Assistant
Director of Development at Highland Regional Council.
''This is my third time at Cannes,'' says Bill Mathieson, ''and the
visits have definitely been successful. It was at Cannes that I made the
connection which suggested the location for the Hamish McBeth series.''
Bill said that he was delighted that the BBC had decided to do another
six-part series, which has to date attracted 10 million viewers for each
episode.
Solicitor Richard Findlay, of Tods Murray WS of Edinburgh, is the only
Scottish lawyer expected to be attending Cannes and Richard, who
specialises in entertainment law, will be attending two seminars being
held at the festival.
''I will be attending a seminar on international agreements covering
multi-media deals in the interactive age, and another organised by Ernst
and Young's New York office on financing for independent producers.''
Richard will also be meeting potential producers of three projects he
is working on on behalf of Scottish clients.
The Cannes Film Festival with its glamorous starlets has, until now,
appeared to be far removed from the serious business of the economic
well being of Scotland but already the Scottish Tourist Board are
reporting an upsurge of enquiries following showings of Rob Roy.
''Following the release of Crocodile Dundee which was shot in
Queensland Australia,'' says Celia Stevenson, of Scottish Screen
Locations, ''tourist visitors to the area increased by 50 per cent.''
Celia pointed to the decision of the Gleneagles Hotel to incorporate a
Rob Roy seat in their hotel as an indication of the possible economic
benefits flowing from a successful film industry in Scotland.
The MacGregor motto of ''Royal is my race'' may in time prove to be an
apt description of the financial return Scotland receives from providing
an alternative to cowboys and indians.

<HEADLINE>United warn City against move for Kidd</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>27</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978337941</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
OLD Trafford manager Alex Ferguson yesterday delivered an emphatic
''hands-off'' warning to neighbours Manchester City over his assistant
Brian Kidd.
The 45-year-old Kidd has emerged as City's top target to replace
sacked manager Brian Horton at Maine Road.
While City chairman Francis Lee denied that he had approached Kidd, he
is known to admire the way Ferguson's No.2 had established United's
successful scouting network.
But Ferguson, who said earlier this year that he expected Kidd would
replace him in the Old Trafford hot seat when he eventually decides to
call it a day, declared: ''There's absolutely no way we will be giving
City permission to speak to Brian.
''He's under contract, and we worked hard last summer to agree a new
three-year deal with him. That's a lengthy contract and there's no way
he's going to leave here.''
Ferguson added that he viewed Kidd as an integral part of the Old
Trafford set-up. ''He is part of Manchester United, we want him here,
and we want him to stay. As far as I am concerned it is important that
Brian Kidd remains part of my team here at Old Trafford.''
Lee, whose decision to end Horton's Maine Road reign after two seasons
was predictable if hurried, expressed anger that he had been reported to
have already moved in on Kidd, who was a favourite for both Manchester
clubs in his playing career.
''I am amazed that this has been said,'' said Lee. ''I wouldn't get in
touch with any player or an employee of any club without first talking
to his chairman.''
If the decision is in Kidd's hands, he seems likely to speak to United
chairman Martin Edwards to get the assurance he requires that he is
Ferguson's successor elect.
If that comes -- and rumours persist that Middlesbrough manager Bryan
Robson could move on to the Old Trafford job when he decides to leave
Ayresome Park -- it seems likely that Kidd will remain at Old Trafford.
Whatever happens, though, Horton's successor is not expected to be
named for a fortnight.
Lee leaves the country today for a Mediterranean cruise expected to
last at least a week and no new manager will be appointed in his
absence.
Speculation will continue, however, as to the identity of the new man
at Maine Road.
Bruce Rioch finishes his Bolton contract at the end of the season
while Sheffield United manager Dave Bassett or former Crystal Palace
manager -- and one-time Manchester United winger -- Steve Coppell could
also feature in the list of names on any target list Lee draws up.

WITH expertise covering a wide range of industries, Barr &amp; Wray don't
blame their customers when they sometimes get confused.
Director Robert Aitken smiles when he explains: ''we are fluid
handling specialists.''
This simple title covers the manufacture of the world's most
sophisticated wave machines, the purification of water, and the supply
of water and waste treatment systems to isolated villages. To add to
their activities the Glasgow based company also supplies specialist
pumping and filtration equipment.
Director Graeme Carey is accustomed to his responsibilities attracting
the most public attention as he looks after the Water Engineering
Division which manufactures, among other things, wave machines.
Such is Barr and Wray's reputation in this field that they recently
supplied a leisure complex in Melbourne, Australia, with a machine. And
when, perhaps predictably, DisneyWorld wanted to create the ''biggest
man-made wave in the world'' they turned to the Glasgow company to
install a #1m machine which makes eight-foot waves.
Nearer home Barr &amp; Wray have also supplied leisure pools in
Musselburgh, Bishopbriggs, Kilsyth, and Hamilton.
''The only problem,'' laughs Graeme, ''was when we publicised our wave
making and leisure pool activities on the sides of our vans. Some of our
industrial customers thought they had hired the wrong type of company.''
Flowpac, is the company's division which designs water systems for
faraway villages in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana as well as
private water supplies in the UK.
Director Michael Taylor looks after this division, which also designs
systems to purify water to a high standard.
''High quality water is needed in the computer industry in the
manufacture of wafers and semi-conducters. The finished article is
rinsed and they have to ensure that there is no cross contamination,''
explains Michael.
To illustrate the high standard of purification required, Michael
explains: ''In an olympic pool you would normally be able to remove a
bucket full of what we term solids. After our treatment the same pool
would only give you a thimble full of solids.''

DANISH goalkeeper Henrik Jorgensen last night quit Dundee United --
less than a year after having joined them in a #180,000 deal that is
still cloaked in controversy.
The 29-year-old, who started just two first-team matches for relegated
United, has now accepted a free transfer offered to him by new manager
Billy Kirkwood as part of his close-season clear-out.
Jorgensen had two years left on his deal with the club and had
originally turned down a free. Now he is expected to return to Denmark.
He will leave behind some unanswered questions over the transfer that
brought him to Scotland just in time to make his debut in the 5-0
thrashing by Hibernian on the opening day of the season.
Ivan Golac paid out #180,000 to complete the deal just months after
Jorgensen had moved from Aarhus to Viborg -- for only #6750.
Earlier this year United asked the SFA to investigate the deal that
brought him to Scotland amid speculation that some of the cash had been
split among individuals. An official of Viborg eventually admitted that
the club had not retained all of the #180,000, but refused to say who
else had benefited.
Kirkwood is continuing with efforts to strengthen his squad while also
trying to offload, and he has been linked with Celtic keeper Gordon
Marshall, Hibs striker Darren Jackson, and Rangers midfielder Neil
Murray.
The United manager said: ''We tried to sign three players before the
transfer deadline and have an offer in for someone right now. But I am
not getting involved with speculation. I will be happy to name people
when deals are done.''
Meantime, Dundee manager Jim Duffy will head for France at the end of
the month for talks with his unsettled goalkeeper Michel Pageaud, who is
desperate to return home. Duffy said:   ''I want to speak to the player,
his wife, and his agent to try to sort out something which will persuade
him to return to Dundee next season.''

<HEADLINE>New chief pledges change at Coopers.  Blin to harness talents</HEADLINE>

AFTER a period when Scotland's best-known corporate undertaker --
insolvency practitioner would be his preferred description -- opted for
a consciously lower public profile, Frank Blin is going to have to push
for the spotlight once more.
This month, Mr Blin, 41, has become the new managing partner
(Scotland) for Coopers &amp; Lybrand, taking over from Robin Wight, who has
given up executive responsibility and will be retiring from the practice
at the end of next year.
That puts Mr Blin at the head of a practice of 28 partners, 550 staff
in offices in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen and an annual turnover in
excess of #30m.
In league table terms -- not something Mr Blin particularly approves
of -- that makes Coopers number two in Scotland. Will there be
significant changes of direction under his leadership?
Yes, said Mr Blin emphatically. ''There's great change in the markets,
sectors and clients we serve.
''Logic says that all that change must impact on us. I've got to give
myself some time to do some analysis and test some hypotheses. But, if
you don't see some changes in our business in 1996, clearly I'll not
have been having any impact.''
Mr Blin insisted his approach will be to harness the Coopers team's
talents to the fresh challenges ahead.
''There's no great need for over-management of this business. But I do
have to provide leadership. There are lots of others around this
business with greater skills in the management arena.
''That enables me to spend more time in the marketplace. I believe
winning business is all about having respect in the marketplace and that
means doing business there myself.''
So this veteran of such high-profile deals as the Galloway Creamery
receivership, the HCI buy-out by the Gulf state Abu Dhabi and
ScottishPower's acquisition of the Clydesdale electrical superstores,
intends to double his new practice responsibilities with ongoing client
assignments.
''I need the thrill of the chase. I need to be involved in clients'
activities. I would be demented if I were to be turned into a full-time
manager,'' he added.
''I want Coopers to be the best in Scotland. I don't particularly care
what size we end up as a consequence of pursuing that objective.
''I mean I don't particularly care whether we are one, two or three.
But I don't believe we could achieve the quality image we seek by being
five or six say.''

''DON'T you just love being in control'' is the marketing slogan for
British Gas' television ads fronted by Joanna Lumley, alias Patsy from
''Absolutely Fabulous''.
In an effort to control the anticipated numbers at its annual general
meeting in London on May 31, British Gas has switched venues twice.
There was an initial switch to the Barbican Centre which itself would
have allowed the meeting to be attended by five times the number of
people who attended last year.
''In view of the large number of shareholders who have said they would
like to come this year, arrangements have now been made for a larger
venue so that everyone can attend,'' said chairman Richard Giordano in a
letter to shareholders.
The new venue for the May 31 meeting is to be Docklands' London Arena,
a venue more used to hosting pop concerts. Its stage management skills
will come in handy to maintain good humour and order among shareholders.
If there is any storming of the stage it is unlikely to be from
adoring fans. But British Gas has drawn the wrath of the general public,
many of whom are also likely to be shareholders, with its blatant greed
at the top.
While job losses have taken place in the company and customer service
has deteriorated, the company's top executives have been awarded
lucrative renumeration packages.
Chief executive Cedric Brown earned total renumeration of #492,602
last year, including benefits, up by #204,837 or 71% on the previous
year.
The actions of the senior management have focused attention on greed
at the top of the privatised utilities and prompted the Labour Party to
call for the industry regulator to be given powers to take into account
senior salary levels when awarding operating licences.
It is also calling for British Gas' largest institutional shareholders
such as the Prudential and Standard Life to vote against the company's
contoversial pay structure at the meeting.
Today, British Gas is expected to report a fall in pre-tax profits for
the three months to end-March from #721m to #600m. A combination of the
mild winter and Ofgas regulation will take its toll.
However, for the full year, profits should benefit from further
cost-cutting allowing 3% real divided growth say analysts at brokers
BZW. At 304[1/2]p the shares are supported by a 6% yield.

DOUGLAS Kinnaird, the highest profile and arguably the most-successful
executive head-hunter in Scotland in recent years, has left PA
Consulting Group after 11 years to start his own business.
The new company, MacDonald Kinnaird (the ''Mac'' comes from Mr
Kinnaird's middle name), will continue to operate in the human resources
field from a central Glasgow base.
But Mr Kinnaird will no longer be concentrating on finding the right
candidates for posts like chief executive of Hydro-Electric or Scottish
Enterprise.
That decision has ensured the parting from PA is amicable. Instead, Mr
Kinnaird hopes to use his wide-ranging experience and contacts to
provide new kinds of services in the fast-changing human resources
field.
''Companies are beginning to question whether they need a #70,000 a
year personnel director. I'm hoping to fill the gap on the three or four
times a year when they need that level of service. The rest of the time
they'll be able to get by with a #30,000 a year personnel manager,'' he
said yesterday.
For the first two years, for two days each week, Mr Kinnaird will be
returning, in a sense, to his accountancy roots. MacDonald Kinnaird has
taken on the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland as its first
client, with a remit to maximise revenues from ICAS's wide range of
commercial services, many of them in the training field.
Mr Kinnaird has also devised tailored business development courses
which will be aimed at professional practices -- lawyers, accountants,
fund managers -- which are struggling to develop their marketing edge.
''I hope my courses will give them the confidence to go out and
develop their businesses in the marketplace. Selling professional
services is different from selling baked beans. But there's still a
selling job to be done,'' he said.
The other strand in MacDonald Kinnaird's portfolio is human resource
consulting -- not direct head-hunting, but the kind of things that Mr
Kinnaird said he used to do as a favour to clients, but will now provide
as a paid service.
''I'll offer an independent assessment of people, either who to choose
from a short-list for a post or an outside opinion on a problem
individual in the organisation, whether to fire them or keep them.''

AMERICAN star Andre Agassi was yesterday fined #1592 for his angry
exchange with a spectator following his quarter-final loss to Sergi
Bruguera at last week's German Open in Hamburg.
ATP Tour spokesman Nicola Arazi said Agassi was fined for
''unsportsmanlike conduct'' for remarks he made to a courtside
spectator, who complained about the quality of the match.
Leaving the court, Agassi swore at the man and, referring to the 1993
stabbing of Monica Seles on the same court, asked: ''Are you going to

SPAIN's Dragados y Construcciones has outbid Scottish yards to win the
contract for a 20,000-tonne gas production platform for the Britannia
field in the North Sea.
Spokesmen for Dragados and Conoco, which operates the Britannia field
jointly with Chevron, said the contract for the basic structure of the
platform, known technically as a steel jacket, was signed last Friday.
Neither was prepared to set a value on the deal, but oil industry
sources said it was probably in the region of #35m to #50m.
The announcement was a body blow for the recently-merged Nigg and
Ardersier fabrication yards near Inverness, which are running out of
work and plan to lay off nearly half their 2200 workforce shortly.
''It's really a bad blow for the Highlands to lose out on this one,''
said Jimmy Gray, the union convenor at Ardersier, who also acts as union
spokesman for entire UK offshore construction industry.
''About 1000 jobs will go between Ardersier and Nigg over the next
three to four weeks,'' he added.
Mr Gray said the situation was less serious for the Trafalgar House
yard at Methill in Fife, which along with the Italian firm Belleli had
also bid for the Britannia jacket.
The Methill yard, which employs about 200 men, had recently started
work on a 10,000-tonne topside module for the British Gas Armada field
and was currently taking on staff, he noted.
Mr Gray had predicted for several weeks that Dragados y Construcciones
would get the Britannia contract. He said yesterday that he believed the
Spanish firm had underbid its UK competitors by about a third.
''This is seriously bad news for Britain's yards where directly
employed jobs have plunged from 25,000 in 1992 to around 7500 today,
with every single one now struggling to survive,'' he said.
Work on the 158-metre high steel jacket for Britannia will start at
the Dragados y Construcciones offshore fabrication yard at Cadiz in
southwestern Spain in August and take two years to complete.
The jacket will then be floated into position 210 km northeast of
Aberdeen on a barge and settled on the sea floor in 136 metres of water.
The topside modules containing work areas and living accommodation are
being built separately by Trafalgar Offshore Fabricators on Teeside and
will be hoisted onto the top of the steel jacket by crane once it is in
place.
The Britannia field, which is operated jointly by Conoco and Chevron,
is due to start production in the last quarter of 1998.
The field is expected to cost #1500m to develop and will have peak
production of 740 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 70,000
barrels per day of gas condensates during its 30-year lifetime.
The gas will be piped ashore at the St Fergus complex near Peterhead.

A PERTH glass manufacturer which was rescued from receivership just
two years ago is now poised for growth once more, with a major
investment programme underway and the prospect of up to 40 new jobs.
Monax Glass, whose factory on the St Catherine's industrial estate
dates back to 1881, currently employs a workforce of 50, many of them
highly skilled in the traditional craft of glass making.
Those jobs looked certain to be lost in the early nineties when the
factory's closure was very much on the cards. Now, however, with a new
owner pumping in #250,000 as the first phase of a long-term development
project and the advice and assistance of Scottish Enterprise Tayside,
director and general manager Ian Grant reckons Monax's fortunes are set
to rise.
''We're now at a stage where we will shortly be looking at taking on
more staff,'' Mr Grant explained. ''That in itself is a significant
achievement.
''While I don't expect to see an immediate return to the glory days
when every steam engine in the world was fitted with tubular gauge glass
produced in this factory, I am confident that we have now reached a
turning point.''
Central to the company's new outlook has been upgrading its massive,
gas-fired furnace. Mr Grant explained: ''Products leaving this factory
are put to highly specialised uses, so it's vital that our glass is of
the very best quality or our customers will go elsewhere.
''Quite simply, the technology in the furnace was past its sell by
date and as a result our reject rate was much too high. If things had
been allowed to continue as they were, the business would have become
unviable in a very short time.''
Addressing this problem in partnership with Monax, Scottish Enterprise
Tayside contracted a team of experts who built a working model of the
furnace to analyse its problems. Now their efforts have borne fruit with
the installation of an ''electric curtain'', which Mr Grant is confident
will make a dramatic improvement to the quality of glass produced.
Scottish Enterprise Tayside's director of company development, Bob
Doak, said: ''This is a classic example of a company which was in fairly
dire straits, but which now has a fighting chance not just of surviving,
but of growing and providing new jobs in Perth.
''I am very pleased that Scottish Enterprise Tayside was able to
assist Monax in its efforts to turn the company around. They have
demonstrated a commitment to this factory and its workforce and deserve
to succeed.''
While the furnace improvements are just one part of a technology
drive, which includes updating the firm's computer system and possibly
introducing industrial robots for simple tasks, the company is adamant
there will be a continued role for the traditional art of glass blowing
and related skills in its manufacturing process.

TWO French oil executives yesterday expressed confidence in the future
of the UK oil and gas industry and pledged not only to continue the
search for new fields but to maximise the existing finds.
Serge Tchuruk, president and chief executive of the Total Group, and
Frederic Isoard, vice-president of oil and gas for Elf Aquitaine, were
speaking at the inauguration of the Dunbar field, 75 miles north-east of
Shetland in which they are partners.
''Total has been present in the UK for more than 30 years,'' Mr
Tchuruk said at the Haddo House ceremony, ''but the level of investment
and new businesses that we keep launching here certainly show that we
are not resting on our laurels or treating the UK as a mature and
non-growth area.''
He said the weakness of the oil price had been one of the driving
forces behind the remarkable development of the North Sea in recent
years demanding an innovative low-cost approach to field development
which had resulted in record levels of production.
''Concerning Total and its gas business, for example, we must not
forget the roots of our activities here in the UK.
In 1977, Total's Frigg Field started production and sent supplies to
British Gas.

* NEWLANDS face a baptism of fire in the premier division of the Men's
Everest National Club League when they take on the David Lloyd Club
Bushey and then Banbury West End in their opening fixtures this weekend.
Australian Brent Larkham and British No.7 Nick Gould have been named
in the Bushey squad for Saturday's home fixture while Larkham's brother
Todd, winner of the recent Satellite event in Edinburgh, will lead the
Banbury team in Sunday's away tie.
But Newlands captain Malcolm Watt, the Scottish No.4, has strengthened
the side who struggled to retain their place among the top 12 British
teams last year.
He said: ''We have added Scottish full-timers Jason Barnett and Euan
McGinn to our existing squad of Calum McKnight, Ian MacAulay, Ronnie
Terras, and myself.
We know what we'll be up against this year, so we are much better
prepared and hopefully we can do enough to stay.''
Newlands women make their premier-division debut after having won the
regional play-offs last year and have added teenage full-timer Nicola
Burns to their line-up of Heather Lockhart, Marjorie Love, and Jennifer
Shaw. They open on Saturday away to Bramhall Park, whose squad include
Scottish junior champion Julia Taylor, while on Sunday they play host to
Huddersfield.
Scottish No.1 Ross Matheson will represent Newcastle side Castle Farm
in the defence of the men's title, while Michele Mair will play for
Queen's Club.
Matheson lost 6-3, 6-4 to Australian Allen Belobrajdic yesterday in a
second-round match in the LTA Satellite Masters at Bournemouth. But
fellow Scot Miles Maclagan continued his winning run when he dismissed
South African Brendan Curry 6-1, 6-2 in the quarter-final.

Shetland Islands Council has drawn up proposals which they hope will
safeguard the future of the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal in the wake of
warnings about its competitiveness.
Details of the proposals will not be released until discussions are
held with several oil companies.
The first warning shots were fired by the Shell/Esso group last month
when they announced they had awarded contracts worth about #500,000 to
confirm the feasibility of offshore loading systems to serve Brent and
other fields.
This would mean by-passing the terminal when the current contract
expires at the end of the century.

<HEADLINE>April minutes reinforce signs of rift between Chancellor and Governor</HEADLINE>

FURTHER signs emerged yesterday of a rift between the Chancellor of
the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and the Governor of the Bank of England
Eddie George.
Minutes of the meeting between the two men on April 5 revealed that
the Governor had warned the Chancellor that the time was not far way
when monetary policy would have to be tightened if sterling's weakness
persisted.
At the following meeting on May 5, Mr Clarke is thought to have
overruled the Governor when he pressed for a hike in interest rates.
In April, Mr George saw no reason to change policy without clear
evidence that demand and output were growing more strongly than the data
currently suggested or that higher input costs were being more
substantially passed on into retail prices.
But he added that this did not take account of what was happening to
the exchange rate. ''Since the previous meeting (in March) the exchange
rate has fallen significantly further -- from 85.5 to 84.4 on the
effective exchange rate.''
It was hard to identify a convincing domestic economic reason for
this. The Governor assumed the fall in the exchange rate was a
side-effect of the turbulence on the foreign exchange markets.
''Whatever the cause, the weakness of the exchange rate is not ipso
facto a reason for tightening monetary policy.
''But if it persists -- and the exchange markets remain very fragile
-- it could aggravate existing demand and cost pressures and make cost
pressures more difficult to contain further down the
production/distribution chain. Policy would then have to be tightened to
achieve the inflation objective.''
Mr George did not think that point had yet been reached, but it could
not be all that far away.
The Chancellor said: ''The only slight causes for concern are the
continued growth of input prices and the weakening of the exchange
rate.''
Commodity and imput prices remained at high levels, but their annual
growth rates had fallen slightly from their peak. Despite the strong
rise in commodity prices, underlying inflation at the retail level had
only risen slightly.
While the weakness of the exchange rate -- which he believed was not
justified by domestic economic considerations -- would add further to
cost pressures, in his view the domestic economy retained some capacity
to absorb higher input costs.
James Capel's Adam Cole was sceptical of Mr Clarke's view that the
overhang of spare capacity in the domestic economy could offset the
impact of sterling weakness.
''The bulk of the spare capacity in the economy is in the service
sector, whereas the principal beneficiaries of a weak exchange rate will
be manufacturers where capacity is much tighter.''
He added that with the local elections out of the way, ''our
assumption remains that the Governor will get his way at the next
meeting on June 7 and base rates will rise by 0.5% at that time''.
Government figures published yesterday confirmed that the pace at
which unemployment is falling has slowed down.
Last month seasonally-adjusted unemployment dropped by 18,900 to
2,327,900 in contrast to declines of over 40,000 at the end of last
year. But Adam Cole said that the latest figures did not suggest that
the economy had slowed to its long-term sustainable growth rate.
Meanwhile growth in average earnings held steady at 3.5% in March, but
unit labour costs in manufacturing fell back from 2.7% in February to
1.2%.
Last month's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, the first for the
1995-96 fiscal year, came in at a higher-than-expected #4261m. There
were no contribution from privatisation. In April last year the PSBR was
#4638m before privatisation proceeds of #393m.
Cash receipts were 9% higher than in April last year with the Inland
Revenue leading the way with a 16% rise. Net department outlays were
3.5% better.
Last year's PSBR has been revised down from #35.6bn to #35.3bn, closer
to the Treasury forecast of #34.3bn. This year's PSBR is projected to
fall to #21.5bn.

DUNDEE United midfielder Billy McKinlay flew out with the Scotland
squad to Japan yesterday with twin targets firmly on his mind.
McKinlay intends using the trip to underline his claims to continue as
a regular member of the squad, even if he does remain with Dundee United
and become a first-division player next season.
He also wants to play in the two games, against Japan and Ecuador, and
use them as a platform to impress English clubs who may yet attempt to
buy him in the close season.
Suspension left McKinlay as a spectator for the losing run which sent
United tumbling out of the premier division. That memory still hurts the
27-year-old, who has been at Tannadice since he was a teenager.
He admitted yesterday: ''I wanted to be in the team to try to help
them escape the drop. I'm not trying to say that my presence would have
kept us in the premier division -- but I would have felt better if I
could have done something instead of just sitting in the stand.''
All of that is now in the past and McKinlay is left wondering what the
future holds for him. He pointed out: ''I made it clear last season,
long before we were in relegation trouble, that I would like to move. My
contract is up next summer and I will certainly not be re-signing for
United.
''These games in Japan can help me get a transfer if I can show up
well and the manager gives me my chance.
''Some of us want to take the opportunity to establish ourselves in
the team. Others, like myself, want to impress other clubs. These games
could be pretty vital for a few of the lads.''
Before flying out yesterday, Scotland manager Craig Brown praised the
midfielder as an important member of his pool of players and stressed
his scoring rate at international level.
With the absence of the men who seem automatic choices for Scotland's
midfield -- Leeds' Gary McAllister and Celtic pair John Collins and Paul
McStay -- McKinlay will beome a key player in the Far East.
But he insists: ''What I have to do is play so well as to make it
impossible for Craig Brown to leave me out when the European
Championship games against the Faroes and Greece arrive. I want to be
playing in these matches when we are trying to make sure that we are
playing in the finals in England next summer.''
Another player who would not have wanted to miss out on the trip is
former Celtic defender Derek Whyte, who has just signed a fresh two-year
contract with newly promoted Middlesbrough.
Whyte joined the squad yesterday and said: ''I have been out of the
Scotland plans for some time now. Now this gives me the chance to get
back in, especially as I will be playing in the Premiership next
season.''
Brown will give all 14 outfield players in the squad a chance to prove
what they can do. That means full international debuts for the quartet
of uncapped under-21 stars in the party -- Paul Lambert, Craig Burley,
Paul Bernard, and Stephen Crawford.
* ALMOST 50 players are taking part in the first apprenticeship scheme
for young footballers in Scotland, a three-day course at Inverclyde.
Scottish Players' Union secretary Tony Higgins said: ''We are
delighted that this is now off the ground. The course is wide-ranging
and allows them to study for both the D and E coaching licences so that
they can help out with kids.
''They will also learn about the importance of diet, personal fitness,
dealing with the media, and understanding their own contracts.''
* QUEEN'S Park coach Hugh McCann has handed out 10 free transfers to
make way for newcomers, and has already signed four for next season.
First-team regulars David Mooney and Jamie Rodden head the list of
released players. The new signings are 19-year-old goalkeeper Gordon
Bruce, from Stoneyburn Juniors, defenders Dennis McGrath and Colin
McLeod, both from Forth Valley, and striker Craig Porter, from Airdrie
Central.
McCann has also arranged a pre-season two game tour of Ireland at the
end of July before returning home to meet Bolton Wanderers.

ALL eyes will be on World No.1 Laura Davies today when she makes her
first appearance of the season on the American Express Tour in the
#110,000 Ford Classic at Chart Hills in Kent.
Davies, the only player, man or woman, to win on five different Tours
in one season when she completed eight tournament victories last year,
has started this season in similar vein. In nine LPGA events she has won
twice, finished second twice, and third once. Twenty of the 32 rounds
she played have been under par, and she tops the LPGA money list with
winnings of $431,176.
Davies has now passed the $2m mark in earnings on the LPGA Tour since
1988. Over $1m has come over the last 17 months. Each of her last 11
rounds in America have been under par.
Davies herself is amazed at her run of success. ''I have no idea how
long it will last. In the case of Nick Price it was two years, but you
never know how long you can keep a run going,'' she reasons.
The big-hitting 31-year-old from Surrey is playing so well that she
says she would love the chance to compete in one of the men's
tournaments. ''I've competed against players like Fred Couples and Ray
Floyd in a mixed event in America, and I'm pretty much level with them
off the tee.''
For the time being, however, Davies will have to content herself with
the fun challenge thrown out to all amateurs on Saturday at a
long-hitting competition -- ''hit it past me and win a prize.'' Anyone
interested is warned, though, that Davies averages around 270 yards and
last month was measured at 376 yards on an airport runway in
Philadelphia.
She returned from America on Monday after having finished second in
the LGPA Championship, during which television commentator Ben Wright
was quoted in a local newspaper as saying that women's golf was being
wrecked by lesbianism and that Davies was ''built like a tank.''
Davies commented: ''I know Ben and he says he didn't make the
comments, so who am I to disbelieve him? The whole thing was ridiculous
and the only loser was the Tour.''
Also back from America are Florence Descampe and Carin Hjalmarsson, a
strong contender for the LPGA's Rookie of the Year award.

SMALL is beautiful in business terms nowadays especially when it comes
to the dreaded knock at the door by the exciseman, a seminar in
Edinburgh was told this week.
Staff cuts within the Customs &amp; Excise means the traditional taxing
visit to a firm's premises is now a thing of the past and that's
official.
This cheery news was released at a new-style business briefing,
designed to make the tradionally austere HM Customs &amp; Excise more user
friendly.
Campbell Arnott, who carries the title of Collector Scotland, said the
organisation was currently undergoing profound cultural change.
''Many of you will be wondering what staff cuts in Customs &amp; Excise
means for business. We shall not be able to visit as many businesses but
we shall provide much more in the way of education, information and
support to those we do not visit.''
However, it is not all good news, for he added: ''Large traders are
unlikely to notice any difference in frequency and extent of contact
with the exciseman.''
Mr Arnott said: ''We know from our survey results that some businesses
feel their efforts as tax collectors are not appreciated and that they
are regarded by our staff as likely to be evading tax wherever possible.
''Worse still, the fear of generating a visit from the lads in the
'knock' who kick doors down, is putting off those with genuine
difficulties from contacting us and asking for help.
''We must change attitudes on both sides if we are to succeed in
reducing burdens to business while improving compliance,'' he concluded.
Staff cuts also mean Customs &amp; Excise plans an exercise to make better
known the existence of its VAT/Excise and Inland customs business advice
centres.
This will include open days and speakers for Chambers of Commerce
together with advice to the Citizens Advice Bureaux and supporting
business shops and enterprise offices.

* A DOZEN Scottish companies will leave for the United States on
Sunday in search of a bigger share of a $75bn market. They operate in
the forefront of one of the world's most rapidly advancing sectors.
The world market for products based on opto-electronics is forecast to
grow to $450bn in the next 20 years.
A wide range of such products are already in use, from the
laser-scanners and supermarket check-outs to the fibre-optic cables
which can carry 10 to 20 channels each.

THE well-heeled residents of Monte Carlo should be careful on their
way home from any late-night society parties over the next week or so.
The roads might not be safe as David Coulthard, the new kid on the
millionaires' block, intends familiarising himself with every bump and
potentially treacherous camber before the Formula 1 circus arrives for
the Monaco Grand Prix.
Coulthard, who moved to the Principality in the South of France
earlier this year, has been left disappointed and frustrated after the
first four races of the grand-prix season and he is determined to make
his move towards the leaders, Michael Schumacher, Damon Hill, and Jean
Alesi.
The Scot and Johnny Herbert are joint-fifth in the overall standings
and while that would satisfy most rookies, it isn't good enough for
Coulthard.
''I know we've raced only four times so far and in Argentina I had
pole for the first time in my life, but I am disappointed,'' he said.
''The last two races have been especially disappointing. I made a
couple of mistakes in Imola and last weekend in Barcelona was just a bad
one all round for the Williams team.''
His team-mate, Hill, lost two places when his car developed hydraulic
problems, and he finished fourth, while gearbox difficulties five laps
from the end, when he was in third position, denied Coulthard a finish.
''Next time I would like everything to be right with myself and my
car, and I will be on the streets as often as possible making sure I am
familiar with them,'' he said. ''I want to take whatever opportunities I
can to drive around the town and get a better picture of the street
course.
''The scene at the moment is amazing, with scaffolding everywhere and
all the safety measures being put in place around the streets. The
entire town has been taken over and is like a building site.
''It is exciting already and it might help my cause that I don't have
far to travel this time. The start/finish line is only two minutes from
my flat.''
However, when the Williams team arrives, Coulthard will check into
their hotel base and vacate his home for his family, who will be in
Monaco to support him.
''It is very expensive to stay here and it doesn't make sense for them
to pay huge hotel bills when they can live in my place,'' he said.
The Monaco Grand Prix, of course, is the most famous street race in
the world. It is a demanding course which leaves little room for error
by the drivers, whose expertise will be tested to the limits on the
tight streets with no thought given to the landmarks, the Hotel de
Paris, the Casino, and the harbour front, normally picked out by passing
motorists.
* SCANDINAVIANS Hannu Mikkola and Gunnar Palm extended their lead
after the twenty-fifth day of the London to Mexico rally when they
completed the thirty-first stage from Panama to San Jose almost 10
seconds faster than their rivals.
Second-placed Australians Ross Dunkerton and Harry Mansson's Datsun
240Z twice suffered flat tyres.

MUCH worse things happen at sea than have to be endured by the mass of
professional golfers, but the unpredicability of a game entwined in the
intricate mechanisms of the swing applied to a dead ball and by elements
of nature beyond any player's control can have a severely destabilising
effect.
For example, Andrew Coltart, who at Dalmahoy today begins his defence
of the Tartan Special Scottish Professional Golf Championship, had two
years of weary struggle before he established himself last season in
forty-second place on the European order of merit, and then won the
Australian PGA title.
Currently, Coltart is eighth on the merit table, 92 places ahead of
Gary Orr, Rookie of the Year in 1993 and runner-up in this championship
12 months ago when he three-putted the last two greens and lost to
Coltart's birdie at the second play-off hole. Such episodes can make and
break careers.
On the other hand Paul Lawrie, the winner in 1992, languishes at 122nd
on the order of merit, whereas Adam Hunter, who won for the first time
in the Portuguese Open in March after 10 unavailing years, is twelfth,
and Dean Robertson, in his first season on the Tour, lies a respectable
seventy-first.
The struggles of Orr and Lawrie explain their absence. Colin
Montgomerie is defending his Spanish Open title, and the demands either
of the Ryder Cup points contest or trying to improve on modest
beginnings account for such as Sam Torrance, Sandy Lyle and Gordon Brand
Jr opting for Madrid's richer rewards.
Even if Andrew Oldcorn had not played as well as he did at St Mellion,
to finish equal fourth after a final round of 65, he would not have
withdrawn for he has missed only one of the last 11 championships and
''I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could win.''
Likewise Hunter was tempted to play in Spain to advance his attempt to
gain Open Championship qualification by finishing in the first five
among the leading 20 on the order of merit not otherwise exempt after
next week's Volvo PGA Championship, which will be his last chance.
Oldcorn, who has been runner-up once and in the first six on other
occasions, thinks it important that some Tour players compete for their
national title. Lancashire born, but a resident of Edinburgh for more
than 25 years -- and with the accent to prove it -- Oldcorn has ''gone
native'' to the extent of wanting to become elligible to play for
Scotland.
Whether residential qualification to play in the championship can be
further extended to a former English amateur champion (even one who is a
Hearts supporter) remains to be decided. More immediately, Oldcorn's
affiliation to the host club naturally inflates expectations of him, and
puts his prospects of taking the #11,000 first prize ''on a hiding to
nothing.''
Quite apart from the regular European Tour players, Oldcorn points
out, there are a lot of good home-based players competing and he
supports Coltart's regret that more players from the home of golf do not
''chance their arm'' more frequently. More French than Scottish players
attended the last Tour qualifying school.
''There are players here strong enough to survive,'' Coltart believes,
''but the learning process is difficult and some don't persevere if they
don't start well. There can be family and financial restraints, of
course, and the Tartan Tour is attractive enough to persuade players to
stay at home.
''The trouble is there are few 72-hole tournaments and pro-ams don't
teach you how to put a four-round score together,'' Coltart added. ''The
game doesn't change in the transition from amateur to professional, but
it becomes a job and if you can't make it immediately on the main Tour
the Challenge Tour builds experience.''
Robertson, making his first professional appearance last May, finished
equal fourth and victory would give him the distinction of joining Eric
Brown, Ronnie Shade and Sandy Stephen as winners of both the Scottish
amateur and professional titles. Otherwise, over 36 holes on Saturday
and Sunday, David Huish defends the championship's senior version.
* ALL but two of the 22 players who have formed the training squad
from which the Walker Cup team to meet the United States at Royal
Portcawl in September are among the 288 entrants for the 100th Amateur
Championship, to be played next month at the Royal Liverpool Club, where
the inaugural event was held in 1885.
They include the five Scottish candidates for the side -- David
Downie, Stephen Gallacher, Barclay Howard, national champion Hugh
McKibbin, and Gordon Sherry. The last named lost in the 1994 final at
Nairn to England's Lee James, who will be joined by three former winners
of the title, Gary Wolstenholme, Garth McGimpsey, and Duncan Evans.
The players missing are Ireland's Richard Coughlan and the Welsh
player Richard Johnson, both attending American colleges.

AYRSHIRE cricket club were cursing their luck again last night after
skipper David Haggo returned from Scotland duty nursing a dislocated
finger which will keep him out of action for at least two weeks.
The wicketkeeper suffered the knock as the Scots tumbled to another
heavy B&amp;H Cup defeat against Northamptonshire on Tuesday.
Haggo, who also opens the batting, will miss two vital club games, as
well as Strathclyde West's Royal Bank Quaich clash with champions North
at Prestwick on Sunday.
Team-mate Andy Tennant remarked: ''It's a big blow to lose Haggs at
this stage in the season. But this is just the latest upset in what has
been a nightmare week for us.''
The club's misery began on Saturday night after a fine County
Championship win over Forfarshire at Broughty Ferry. But their joy was
marred when vandals broke into Tennant's car and set it ablaze. Three
players had cricket gear worth #1500 destroyed in the incident and as a
result the club's Scottish Cup tie against Aberdeenshire on Sunday had
to be cancelled.
Among the items lost is the cap Tennant won when he represented
Scotland last season.
* KENT did Somerset a favour as they stormed into the quarter-finals
of the Benson and Hedges Cup yesterday.
The eight-wicket victory over Sussex at Hove -- Kent's fourth
successive Group D win -- ended the hosts' slim hopes of qualifying and
let Somerset through on a superior run rate.
Kent reached their target of 304 with eight wickets and 17 deliveries
to spare. Captain Mark Benson struck a competition-best 119.
BENSON &amp; HEDGES CUP
At Swansea. Gloucestershire 176-8; Glamorgan 167. Gloucestershire won
by 9 runs.
At Hove. Sussex 303-6; Kent 307-2 (M R Benson 119, T R Ward 76, M J
Walker 69 n.o.). Kent won by eight wickets.
At Lord's. Middlesex 276-8; Combined Universities 120-4. Middlesex won
by a faster scoring rate.

SCOTLAND lost their opening match 3-2 against Chinese-Taipei at the
World championships in Lausanne yesterday, despite winning the first two
matches.
Elinor Allen and Kenny Middlemiss put Scotland's first points on the
board when they defeated Mou Chou Lee and Hsin Li Kao 15-12, 15-4 in the
opening match, despite the fact that Allen was shoeless less than half
an hour before they were due on court.
Her luggage failed to turn up in Geneva and there is every chance her
sports bag is now being opened by a member of the Scottish rugby team,
who shared their flight to Heathrow on the way to South Africa.
However, a last-minute reprieve was organised for Allen when former
Scottish Badminton Union president Ritchie Campbell managed to bring out
an old pair of her shoes on his flight.
''It made such a real difference to have my own shoes,'' said Allen
after the match. ''Although they are so old they give no support, it's a
lot better than having to break in a new pair of shoes. In fact, it may
even have been a good thing, because the floors are very sticky.''
A well disguised array of shots secured Allen and Middlemiss a
relatively easy victory over the Chinese-Taipei players, despite a few
butterflies when they neared match point.
''We were both really nervous,'' said Allen. ''I think it showed when
we were 14-2 up in the second game and began making mistakes. We were
desperate to wrap it up.''
Scottish No.1 Anne Gibson beat Lin Chan 11-2, 10-12, 11-8 to make it
two out of two for Scotland, but they failed to capitalise on their
early lead.
Middlemiss and Russell Hogg lost 15-10, 15-7 in a gruelling doubles
battle with Chuan Chen Huang and Shin Jeng Horng, and Allen and her
newly-married sister, Jenny Williamson, were beaten 15-10, 15-5 in the
women's doubles.
Scottish champion Bruce Flockhart made a brave attempt to come from
behind in his game with Mou Chou Lee, saving match point on several
occasions with effective smashes to his opponent's backhand, but he
eventually went down 15-10, 15-7.
Scotland 2, Chinese-Taipei 3. Details: K Middlemiss and E Allen beat M
Lee and H Kao 15-12, 15-4; A Gibson beat L Chan 11-2, 10-12, 11-8; K
Middlemiss and R Hogg lost to C Huang and S Horng 15-7, 15-10; E Allen
and J Williamson lost to H Tsai and L Chen 15-10, 15-5; B Flockhart lost

<HEADLINE>Ferguson joins long line of striking personalities</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>26</PAGE>

<TEXT>
FORGET groin strains and pulled hamstrings, Duncan Ferguson is in
greater danger of spraining a wrist from signing endless autographs or
suffering bruised shoulder blades with all the back-slapping.
Whenever the Everton striker appears on the streets of Liverpool he
causes a stir -- not unlike that provoked by a certain four local young
men in the 1960s with their guitars and long hair. For Beatlemania read
Fergiemania.
Perhaps the big Scot should get the Queen's Award for Industry to go
with the FA Cup winners' medal he expects to collect against Manchester
United on Saturday.
Ferguson's face smiles out from T-shirts and coffee mugs, and there is
no shortage of takers at the club shop. One of the most popular T-shirts
features his name emblazoned three times across the front and his
trademark No.9 on the back.
In these days when a central striker could be No.32, Everton quickly
realised the sales potential of slapping No.9 on Ferguson's back. He
inherited the number from the newly departed Tony Cottee after arriving
from Rangers on loan in October.
Lesser players might have buckled under the weight of expectation.
After all, Ferguson was stepping into a role occupied by a series of
Goodison immortals.
Bustling Brummie Bob Latchford became the first man in six years to
net 30 League goals at the end of the 1977-78 season. Gary Lineker
matched that total in 1985-6 -- but on both occasions Everton won
nothing.
Graeme Sharp, David Johnson, Alan Whittle, Mike Trebilcock, Roy
Vernon, Dave Hickson and Tommy Lawton all bathed in the Goodison glory
spotlight. But the trio who outstripped all rivals in the popularity
stakes were Billy 'Dixie' Dean, Alex Young, and Andy Gray.
Dean was the best finisher English football has ever known. His 60
League goals in the 1927-28 season is a record likely to stand for ever.
Dean cheated death in a motorcycle accident at 19 to found the Goodison
No.9 dynasty.
Apart from those 60 goals, Dean chalked up a formidable list of
achievements -- 100 League goals before the age of 21, 200 League goals
in 199 games (aged 23), 300 League goals in 310 games, and a total of
349 goals in 399 Everton league matches.
He registered 37 career hat tricks, more than 20 league goals per
season in nine consecutive years, more than 30 League goals in four
seasons, and a total of 353 League goals in just over 12 seasons --
beating Steve Bloomer's career record of 352 in 22 seasons. Not bad for
a #3000 signing from Tranmere.
Dean was a hard act to follow -- as Lawton discovered. Lawton's 34
goals helped Everton to the 1939 title, but the Toffees cashed in after
the war when Chelsea made him the first #20,000 player.
Gray was the catalyst for Everton's transformation from relegation
candidates to one of England's top clubs through the mid-1980s and
scored a typically robust goal in the 1984 FA Cup against Watford that
sparked off a run of honours. Even when the fearless Scot was not
playing, he was an influential figure in the dressing room.
Now fiery Ferguson is donning the mantle of Goodison talisman.
Disciplinary problems on and off the pitch have encouraged the young
Scot to seek a lower profile by shunning interviews.
But Fergie's profile will soar as high as his pet pigeons if he
follows Gray's example and notches an FA Cup-winning goal on Saturday.

SHARON McMaster lifted the McRobert Thistle Cup with a comfortable
four-stroke cushion at the end of the qualifying rounds in the Scottish
Women's Amateur Golf Championship at Porpatrick Dunskey yesterday.
Despite driving poorly, McMaster added a 73 to her opening 69 for a
two-round aggregate of 142. The Dunbar internationalist headed Alison
Rose into today's opening matchplay round with Helen Monaghan, Heather
Stirling and former champion Fiona Anderson a further two strokes
adrift.

BERNHARD Langer, undoubtedly the most consistent golfer on the
European Tour, will equal a record that has stood since 1979 if he makes
the halfway cut at the Spanish Open in Madrid this week.
The German needs to qualify for the last two rounds to achieve the
feat of playing 56 consecutive tournaments without missing a single cut.
If he does that he will equal the record set by England's Neil Coles
between 1973 and 1979.
''It would be nice to equal the record,'' says Langer. ''If I do, I
will be going all out to make the cut in the Volvo PGA tournament at
Wentworth next week to break the record.''
The last time Langer missed a cut was in the Italian Open in 1991, and
even that was not in the usual manner. ''I had to pull out after playing
11 holes in the second round because of back trouble,'' he explained.
''But I don't think I would have made the cut anyway, even if I had
finished the round, so I've no complaints.''
Langer, who has won a European Tour event in each of the last 16
years, finished fifth in the Spanish Open last year when the event was
won by Colin Montgomerie in a close finish.
Richard Boxall, Mark Roe and Mark McNulty all birdied the last hole to
finish level on 278, and Montgomerie came to the eighteenth needing a
birdie himself for outright victory. He made no mistake, hitting a drive
into the middle of the fairway, a magnificent wedge to two feet and
holed the putt for an 11-under-par aggregate of 277.
Montgomerie defends his title in a field that includes five US Masters
champions in Langer, Seve Ballesteros, Jose Maria Olazabal, Sandy Lyle,
and Ian Woosnam.
Ballesteros is joint record holder at the Club de Campo with
Argentinian Eduardo Romero, with a nine-under-par 63 set in 1991, but he
pines for Langer's consistency. ''My problem is that I always seem to
have one bad round each week,'' said the 38-year-old Spaniard. ''I just
do not feel as confident as I should.''

A CALL for veterinary surgeons to take the moral high ground and help
stop livestock exports met with a cool reception from the profession
yesterday.
The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons said it had already made its
position clear by urging that farmers, dealers and others should ensure
slaughter at as near the point of production as possible. But while the
legal trade continued it was vets' role to police it.
The plea for more veterinary involvement was made by animal welfare
charity Compassion in World Farming.

AGRICULTURE Minister William Waldegrave was accused of wanting to turn
a proposed new farmer-financed body into a near quango yesterday.
The charge was levelled by John Heading, chairman of the Potato
Marketing Board which is due to be phased out by mid-1997 and replaced
by the proposed GB Potato Organisation funded by levy.
Speaking at an open day at the board's Sutton Bridge experimental
station in Norfolk, Mr Heading revealed that Mr Waldegrave was insisting
on ministerial nomination of the board members and chairman of the new
organisation.
He said: ''There are two things the minister finds unacceptable under
the 1993 Act, and they are the democratic election of members of the
organisation and the question of election of the chairman.
''The minister regards it as necessary under the 1947 Act to nominate
the members of the organisation and indeed the chairman, and that is
only partially acceptable to levy payers.
''In some ways it seems he regards the new body as a quango and that
is of concern to us.''
He went on: ''In practical terms there is plenty of evidence to
suggest that nominated members can be just as effective as elected
members. What we have to ensure is that we have the right people with
the right skills, expertise and experience who can lead the industry
through a difficult period as we move to the free market.''
Currently all farmer members of the PMB are elected and only three
independents are nominated by the minister. The board of the new
statutory organisation would comprise between 11 and 15 members, the
majority of whom would represent levy payers.
Mr Heading said it was also important there should be steady progress
towards a uniform potato regime throughout Europe to ensure level
trading terms.
He added that an announcement on the future of the Sutton Bridge
station would be made by mid-summer.

A GERMAN court yesterday declared a two-year doping ban on former
world sprint champion Katrin Krabbe to be illegal. The ruling by the
regional court in Munich sent shock waves through the German and
international athletics governing bodies, who have been ordered to pay
compensation.
But the reverberations will be felt far beyond the International
Amateur Athletic Federation's headquarters in Monaco, where it was
immediately announced that an appeal would be lodged.
The former Commonwealth 800 metres champion, Diane Modahl, whose
doping appeal is due to be heard in July, is threatening legal action
against the UK authorities, while the International Olympic Committee is
trying to establish arbitration procedures which would prevent drug
defaulters from taking recourse to the courts as Krabbe has done.
If the courts of individual nations deny international sport bodies
the right to govern and impose sanctions, then anarchy will prevail.
Damages of several million pounds will have to be paid if Krabbe's
140-page judgment stands. Though that in itself would not cripple the
IAAF, damages even on a lesser scale would bankrupt many smaller
international sport governing bodies who will be exposed if a precedent
is set.
Christopher Winner, IAAF spokesman, said: ''All other federations will
shudder at this judgment. We don't consider Krabbe's claim valid. She
took the drug, and admitted taking it. Nor do we believe it is the
competence of civil courts to rule in federation matters, and we stand
by our rules.''
The IAAF and German Track Federation imposed bans on the 25-year-old
athlete, and two fellow Germans, after the three failed an
out-of-competition test in South Africa in 1992. They had taken
Clenbuterol, an anabolic agent and stimulant.
* THE Scottish Athletic Federation have taken exception to remarks
made on a TV programme, Sport in Question, which on one of its rare
excursions into athletics was fed information which was spectacularly
wrong.
A coach in the audience blamed a late grant application for Scotland's
failure to host this year's major international, and the panel
pontificated on the situation. In fact, SAF's grant application to the
Scottish Sports Council was made earlier than usual, and the cost of
hosting this match was not part of the application.
An SAF cash shortfall and sponsorship problems forced the fixture to
be shifted to Wales, who now also are experiencing difficulties.
* NORTHERN Ireland have withdrawn from Sunday's City of Glasgow
International 10,000m road race. Liz McColgan and Yvonne Murray have
declined selection, and Scotland will now be led by Vikki McPherson
(City of Glasgow). The other Scots are Sue Ridley (Edinburgh Woollen
Mill), Marlene Gemmell (Strathkelvin Ladies) and Jan Stevenson (Falkirk
Victoria).
There are already 1200 entries for Scotland's largest women-only race,
which starts at Kelvingrove Art Gallery (10am). Entries will be accepted
on the day until 9.25.
The city council hopes to top 8000 entries for the Great Scottish Run
(half-marathon) on August 20. Entry forms are available via the 24-hour
hotline: 0141 227 5567. Cost is #9 for club runners, #9.50 for
non-members.
* BRITISH junior indoor champion Des Roache (Clydesdale) won the 1500m
at the British Milers Club Invitation Races at Wythenshaw Track in
Manchester last night with a personal best of 3min 47.1sec, bettering
the qualifying standard for the European Junior Championships in Hungary
by more than a second.
Scottish junior Richard Girvan (Kilbarchan), 1-51.1, defeated Alastair
Donaldson (Pitreavie), 1-51.5, in the 800m race.

THE prospect of top quality milk from pedigree Ayrshire herds selling
at a premium price in stores throughout Britain was outlined to members
of the Ayrshire Cattle Society at its annual meeting in Renfrew
yesterday.
Consultants appointed by the society are to conduct a feasibility
study into the creation an ''Ayrshire'' trade mark, with processors
throughout the country operating under licence to produce a named brand
product using milk from local registered Ayrshire herds.
That vision is based in part on the success enjoyed in Scotland by
Marks &amp; Spencer, which since autumn 1993 has sold nothing but Ayrshire
milk -- supplied by Scottish Pride -- in its Scots stores. Mike Hogg,
dairy products buyer for M&amp;S, was coy about total figures but confirmed
that since introducing the Ayrshire brand in tartan packs it had enjoyed
a 13% sales increase.
On the back of that experience the society is now keen to establish
Ayrshire as a distinctive brand aiming for a niche market at the quality
end of the trade. It has appointed Dr Tony O'Sullivan of the Agri-Food
Consultancy to conduct a feasibility study as part of a marketing
development scheme which is 50% funded by the Scottish Office.
That study will include work at the Hannah Research Institute to
produce a technical evaluation of Ayrshire milk, including flavour. The
laboratory work will be set against the views of a consumer panel which
will compare Ayrshire to other milks. The aim will be to back up the
perception of it as a superior product worthy of a price premium.
One possibility might be for some Ayrshire producers to form their own
processing group, said Dr O'Sullivan. He forecast increasing
fragmentation in the milk processing industry with the dominance of
Scottish Milk, and Milk Marque in England, being eroded as other
groupings were formed.
In an address to the society Mr Hogg illustrated some of the
complexities of the milk business. The Ayrshire product was an
unmitigated disaster when it was introduced in six London stores, he
said. The customer view was that if the milk genuinely came from
Ayrshire it could not be very fresh.
Questioned on alternate day collection from farms, Mr Hogg said he
felt milk should be a fresh product. ''If you produce a high quality
milk you don't want it sitting around in tanks for an extra 24 hours --
you want to ship it out daily.'' In Scotland milk for M&amp;S is collected
from 35 farms each day.
In the southern English stores M&amp;S is introducing a ''selected farm''
scheme with collections made specifically for it. There is no English
equivalent of the quality image of the Ayrshire breed as a milk source,
he said.
He forecast a broadening of the price band with the possibility of a
higher rate for top quality but less money on offer for producers who
did not invest in good husbandry or modern equipment.
* SCOTTISH Milk is reviewing its payment policies in the light of a
series of meetings with more than 1100 producers across the country.
There have been reports of some farmers considering changing their
allegiance when contracts come up for renewal, but Scottish Milk, the
dominant player north of the Border, said it believes members realise
the benefits of having their own strong, successful co-operative.

PETER Niven reached his 100th winner of the season at Perth last night
with a double on Hit The Canvas (4-6) and Uron V (5-4) in the first two
races. Niven, whose family home is at Carnoustie 25 miles from the
course, was completing the third century of his career. Both winners are
trained by his boss, Mary Reveley.
Hit The Canvas, wearing the Peter Savill colours of Celtic Swing, gave
him an armchair ride in the MacAllan Juvenile Hurdle, cruising into the
lead before the third last and beating Tom Dyer's Stash The Cash by
three lengths.
Uron V, an often unpredictable jumper had an even easier win in the
Coopers and Lybrand Novices Chase. He led from the start and came home
20 lengths in front of Bula Nuday.
Niven, aged 30, who was presented with a gallon of whisky, said:
''It's nice to get back in the hundreds, especially after last year,
when I thought I was going downhill.''
* THIRTEEN points ahead of his nearest rival, Scotland's leading
point-to-point rider Kevin Anderson is already assured of his sixth
Northern Area championship.
He missed out Saturday's Border meeting at Corbridge because the going
was too firm, but will definitely go to Alnwick this weekend for the
final meeting of the season.
Anderson, with 14 winners so far, three short of his 1994 total, will
partner the in-form Miss Enrico in the Shiel and Morrison Men's Open
race.
In less than three weeks the nine-year-old mare has won confined races
at Fife and Lauderdale and a restricted at Braes of Derwent.
She takes on much stiffer opposition on Saturday, including a ''posse'
of pot-hunters from Yorkshire where the season ended last week.

WELL. A night and a half at the movies -- not least in its duration --
in the swashbuckling company of Douglas Fairbanks Sen with Carl Davis
conducting the Royal SNO.
Last of a series of three classic silents, in some ways, The Thief of
Bagdad (1924) was the most stunning of the lot. High melodrama (with
corny titles), buccaneering adventure, and mind-boggling sets and
special effects combined to make a hugely entertaining experience. And
all backed by a very clever score, compiled, composed and conducted by
Carl Davis.
Decades -- nay, more like half a century before their time -- the
special effects of art director William Cameron Menzies stole the show,
lock, stock and barrel. Towering buildings: sleek, elegant and oriental,
suggested no expense spared in the sets.
In a welter of effects -- from flying carpet to winged horse, from
invisibility illusions to Fairbanks Sen sprinkling oofle dust and
creating an instant army -- the undersea scene, brilliantly composed
with Fairbanks in slow motion and his baggy pants billowing exactly as
they would underwater, capped the lot.
Fairbanks own performance -- nimble and lightfooted -- was balletic in
its choreography. No wonder he was dubbed the Nijinsky of the movies:
classical grace married to romantic panache.
Panache galore too from the Royal SNO playing Carl Davis's score,
largely a masterly deconstruction of Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade,
with every motif, every rhythm, and every colour of the Russian
masterpiece, subjected to either literal application or infinite
extension. Equally, the best cuts of the same composer's Golden Cockerel
were called into magical service. First-rate series. More please.

OH to be a great lover! Maybe Johnny Depp is not everyone's idea of
one, although many teeny boppers do drool over the lad, but he does have
a pleasing personality and considerable charisma. In Don Juan De Marco,
an appealing romantic fantasy, written and directed by Jeremy Leven, his
attempt at playing the greatest of them all, Don Juan, proves remarkably
successful.
The time is the present. A young man, masked, caped and in high-heeled
boots, the full Zorro-style works, strides into a restaurant and seduces
a young woman waiting for her dinner date with honeyed words. Then he
announces he must die, and leaves her at the table bewitched,
bewildered, but far from bothered. We next find him standing on a
catwalk high above the street and a psychiatrist, Dr Jack Mickler
(Marlon Brando), has to talk him out of throwing himself off.
The young man, who says he is Don Juan, is sent to a psychiatric
hospital for tests. Is he mad? A schizophrenic? A would-be suicide who
must be detained for his own good? Can Dr Mickler, due to retire in 10
days' time, diagnose what is wrong? Will his own life -- his marriage to
Marilyn (Faye Dunaway) is under strain -- be revitalised by the
challenge of dealing with this amazingly persuasive romantic dreamer?
Depp swashbuckles adeptly, Brando beguiles in one of his most
substantial roles in ages, and exudes world-weary charm, while Dunaway,
clearly in her prime, makes Marilyn, a woman ready to sink into old age,
all passion spent, warmly sympathetic.
The alleged Don's life story is undeniably romantic, but also nicely
tongue in cheek. Is he from Mexico? Did he really have a grand passion
for Dona Julia, wife of his tutor, Don Antonio, which ended in a duel
with her husband, his father's death, and his mother going into a
nunnery? Did he become the delight of the harem in some Mediterranean
Arab land, entertaining not just the Sultana Gulbeyaz, but, as he
unwisely confesses to Dona Inez, the next love of his life, whom he
meets when shipwrecked, also make love to 1502 other women? Or is he
just a crazy boy from Queens, brought up in Phoenix, Arizona, whose
father died in a car crash, whose mother is no better than she should
be, and who has read too much Byron?
Dr Mickler, revitalised by the case, takes his wife out to dinner,
showers her with jewels and flowers, and has her serenaded by a Spanish
band while across the restaurant, seated by herself, dreaming of Don
Juan, is the young woman from the opening sequence, one of many nice
touches in a diverting script.
When it come to video games I read books, so the point of Street
Fighter evades me. If people want to play video games, play them. Why
watch a film based on one? In this slackly scripted, extremely silly
tale, Jean Claude Van Damme, the Muscles from Brussels, as a most
belligerent United Nations Colonel called Guile, takes on General M
Bison (Raul Julia), an Asian war lord with plans to rule the universe.
The special effects are run-of-the-mill, Jean Claude does not for once
dominate the action, Julia, who died after making the film, is clearly
not a well man, and the less said the better about Kylie Minogue's
antics as Guile's peroxide blonde sidekick. Game aficionados may enjoy
it, but I suspect they would get more fun actually playing the game.
In Rob Roy, reviewed on Monday, Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange as the
cattle-punching MacGregors go roamin' at hush of eventide through some
hills beyond the Clyde to their shieling down in the the glen, while the
Scottish Tourist Board rubs its hands in glee amid the heather on the
hill.
* CANNES truly is the world's most glamorous film festival, a
celluloid feast at which the unwary can over-indulge dangerously. This
year the programme is not dominated by American films, and a good half
dozen of the 24 films in competition are British in one sense or
another.
Financing these days is so complex that few films are exclusively
British, but the talent involved in the half dozen is enough to lay
claim to them. It does not, as you might think, give the lie to the
state of our film industry which is in terminal decline, but
demonstrates if you save what is made to show all at once the result
looks more impressive than the reality.
As you read this, I shall be at my first press screening -- the
''working'' day starts at 8.30am, ends well after midnight -- and since
I am on the international press jury run by FIPRESCI, a first for me,
there will be no missing movies either when the going gets tough, as it
will over the next 10 days.
Among the films on offer are: the new Merchant Ivory costume drama,
Jefferson in Paris, with Nick Nolte, the American ambassador during the
French Revolution, became President of the United States and fathered
several children by a coloured slave; Carrington, in which Emma Thompson
and Jonathan Pryce take on the Bloomsbury set: Ed Wood, starring Johnny
Depp, Tim Burton's loving account of the sad, but funny career of
Hollywood's worst film director; Land and Freedom, Ken Loach's highly
politicised tale about the Spanish Civil War, which has already won rave
reviews in Spain; Kids, an American film about under-age sex which seems
destined to cause the scandale no festival should be without; Diane
Keaton's delightful debut as director, Unstrung Heroes, about a young
boy growing up in 1960s New York forced to face up to his mother's
imminent death from cancer, and his father's inability to cope with Andi
McDowell and Joh Turturro.
There is also John Boorman's story of political repression, Beyond
Rangoon, set in 1980s Burma; The Madness of King George, getting its
European premiere; Terence Davies's The Neon Bible set in the American
South starring Gena Rowlands, which should show whether he can make a
film not based on his own childhood; Madagascar Skin, starring John
(Four Weddings) Hannah directed by Chris Newby who made Anchoress; and
Zhang Yimou's Shanghai Triad, his last film with Gong Li, their
relationship having ended. Some are in competition, some in the
Directors' Fortnight, some in Un Certain Regard, and some, like the
third Die Hard, in the market-place.
Our very own Hugh Grant has two films on show, An Awfully Big
Adventure and Chris Monger's The Man Who Went Up A Hill And Came Down A
Mountain, one of those titles about which second thoughts might have
been worth having. Hugh is the man who went to four weddings a starlet
and left the funeral a star.
The main jury is chaired by Jeanne Moreau, grande dame of French
cinema, so expect high seriousness when they dish out the prizes. I will
be reporting the goings on along the Croisette next Thursday.

BET LOW is popular with public and critics alike. This stems partly
from her compulsive honesty, partly from her subject: the Hebridean
theatre of the elements with Orkney at its centre. Together, a heady
brew.
Low's love of Orkney's open expanses of wind and weather is palpable
in the pale and remarkable Edge of the Sea, Skaill and in her new series
of Orkney beaches just after sundown and Ross-shire lochs at dusk, with
their intense purples and blues.
Simplicity is her bible, yet she can create drama with a mere five
bands of colour, epitomised by a tiny abstract, Orkney Night, where rich
peach and creamy clouds reflect over an ultramarine horizon on Scapa
Flow.
An impressive departure is Lachlina, a hidden pool of emerald green
near Arisaig where scattered headstones in a hidden graveyard act like
notes on a music score to orchestrate chords of peaceful solitude. More
homely is Heat of the Day where sheep burrow under a hedge in the
noonday sun.
Jim Ede said if he could find another word for God, it would be
''balance''. In her best pictures Low's sense of balance is omnipotent,
too.

THE best news I've had in ages was from Sibylle von Halem, currently
exhibiting in St Andrews and sculptor in residence at Stranraer. ''The
new Glasgow Gallery of Modern Art has bought my brass Veil sculpture!''
Von Halem's piece is too new a purchase to feature on this exhibition's
interactive CD Rom (not as posh as it sounds -- you press coloured
buttons and 20 different pictures come on screen in assorted and poor
colourways). However, it does give hope that the new gallery, to be
opened in spring 1996 in the old Stirling's Library in Royal Exchange
Square, will be more representative of Glasgow artists.
The current show, we are told, aims to dispel the idea that modern art
is difficult. It consists of only seven works. Best known is John
Byrne's illustration of Robbie Coltrane in Tutti Frutti. Unknown is
Papua New Guinean Matthias Kauage's patterned decoration, Buka War,
where the army's weapons include a magical kangaroo as well as hand
grenades.
Jo Spence's photo of herself after breast cancer has been seen before;
so too Howard Hodgkin's print. The London press has made much of
Spalding's aquisition of three pictures by the untrained, ex-landlady,
Beryl Cook, who began painting in middle age.
One picture is acceptable if all good Scots were already represented,
but going by this banal Karaoke oil, (Cook's oils sell for around
#12,000 each) Glasgow doesn't need patronising like this. The other
exhibits are Hoch-Aun Teh's lively abstract and Hamilton Finlay's small
sculptural anti-aircraft gun.
The inventory is notable for its lack of young stars and older key
figures. Let's hope things are rectified by 1996.

FREAKS -- in Coney Island showterms -- are folk with physical
abnormalities. Their's is an inborn commodity; true oddities of nature
that people pay to gawp at.
Geeks -- and again we're talking Coney Island here, have to cultivate
their differences. They have to devise an act that will draw crowds; not
necessarily because it is superbly skilled, but because it is wild,
outre. Geeks would not pull rabbits out of hats . . .
Robert Pacitti -- whose show, Geeks, opens at the CCA tonight -- is
clueing me up about these defining differences. Pacitti, a
performance-maker of abrasive integrity, spent two consecutive summers
prowling round the booths of Coney Island, soaking up the curious
atmosphere of loathing and fascination that lingers there.
Then he started thinking of how he could bring some of the attitudes
-- of performers, as well as onlookers -- into his current work.
''We started looking at the issue of difference from a racial
standpoint, but we didn't have any black people in our group. So we
looked at the colour we wear; we looked at whiteness; at the
discrimination -- privileges really -- that come with the skin.''
But there was another difference that concerned him -- one that is
rooted in his own identity: gay sexuality. ''Homophobia is really, the
last acceptable prejudice -- and, quite honestly, I don't see any
liberation on that front. Some people undoubtedly see queers as freaks
of nature -- actually, we're geeks!'' Pacitti recognises that audiences
will react across a similar spectrum to that observed at Coney Island.
''For one thing, there's the voyeuristic part. Audiences are
encouraged to peep. There's the hint that it might be dubious, shocking
-- worse, it might be enjoyable! And if you have declared yourself as a
sexual dissident -- a queer, a geek -- then they have to peep. You're
relying on it! It's your livelihood, it's your existence, it's your very
identity''.
Ravelled into this, however, is the potential vulnerability of the
person on display. ''Some of what we do, it's a struggle topull it
together; it's a delicate balance, getting the right spin across. And
you can feel people just waiting for it to collapse about you.''
Geeks -- like the Coney Island sideshows -- is entertainment with a
disruptive edge. The piece is, after all, dealing in gender politics and
cultural identity. Pacitti accepts -- expects -- that people will be
upset by some of what they see.
* Geeks is at the CCA from tonight until Saturday.

EDINBURGH'S streamlinedFestival Theatre is not quite the sort of space
Peter Brook intended for his Tragedy of Carmen. But then, Karen Howard's
production of Peter Brook's gloss of Bizet's Carmen is not quite what
either Brook or Bizet planned in the first place.
Presented by Crystal Clear Opera as part of an extensive tour of
theatres much smaller than Edinburgh's, it was a crystal-clear
performance only in the sense that it pared Bizet to the bone. That
much, of course, we already knew from Brook's own treatment of it at the
Glasgow Tramway.
But Howard's aims proved different. In place of Brook's intimate
dynamism there was sombre, slow-moving Spanish ritual. Whereas Brook
sought to restore the ''Merimee dimension'', as he called it, to the
story, Howard made it look more like Lorca. The costumes were mostly
black, with flashes of white. The designs were a wall, a doorway, a
corridor, and a full moon that glowed red as the climax approached.
With a small bullring as the acting area, it was all very symbolic.
And with Hyacinth Nicholls as a substitute and somewhat cautious Carmen,
the action focused even more than Brook intended on the Don Jose of
Andrew Forbes-Lane. Both brought drama to their music, facing the
challenge of the large auditorium rather more effectively than the rest
of the cast.
Martin Handley's limply conducted performance could not conceal that
Brook's Tragedy is Bizet's masterpiece reduced to an ill-ordered
''highlights from Carmen''. Of the opera's structure, its vivid
interplay of music and speech, nothing remained. The shock-value it
possessed a decade ago seemed largely to have vanished. It was preceded
on this occasion by a dry, drab, concert performance of music from
Falla's Love the Magician. There was a large audience.

There is light at the end of the tunnels after bureaucracy belatedly
allows access to Colourspace, reports ANN COLTART
SCULPTOR Maurice Agis is so much a believer in accessible public art
that he wraps people up in his work and lets them get lost in it. He
lost his public in Glasgow last week, however.
Bureaucracy ruled that he needed an entertainments licence before
anyone could enter his massive Colourspace on Glasgow Green. After a
week of form-filling, checks by the fire service and building control,
and small alterations to his structure, he opened at last and will be
there until May 21.
Agis has been specialising for several years in inflated PVC sheeting
welded in interlocking chambers of different colours. The translucence
of natural light through the 64 connecting units produces the purity of
primary colours and the reactions of each on the others, swelling away
in all directions.
The effect can be dramatic. Viewers and feelers of his structures
often experience a serene well-being, individual mood changes along with
a sense of communality -- though a few are disorientated by a maze of
light and colour in which they are left to wander.
Colourspace is next to the People's Palace. Although the Mayfest
programme states that ''it's on'' at 12 noon each day, visitors may
enter until the evening, staying as long as they like.
The last time one of Agis's PVC sculptures came to Glasgow was during
its year as Culture City in 1990. He didn't need a licence then, in
Glasgow or anywhere else.
Some sceptics say this is not real sculpture, just a bunch of
balloons. Whatever Colourspace may be, it does offer a sensual
experience which tends to strip viewers of the gallery body language
found in solid art venues.
In a little ritual at the entrance visitors take off their shoes,
lined up as in a mosque vestibule, and don silky coloured capes to add
further to the glows inside.
Within minutes, it is easy to become lost, unsure of the place one
started. Children tend to rush around, testing the different colours and
hiding before appearing somewhere else along a multi-shaded rounded
corridor. Adults are usually more contemplative, and often sit down in a
chamber of their colour choice.
Music, dance and readings have regularly been part of Colourspace and
the sculptor's long-term collaboration with American composer Stephen
Montague continues at Mayfest with his environmental sound installation
for the structure.
Agis in visor and welding armour, grinding away at metal in his East
London studio, is not only a PVC person. He works in harder materials
too.
He was a student and later teacher at St Martin's School of Art and
Goldsmith's, and one of the artist's resisting developers taking over
Thames warehouses in the early Thatcher years, when their dereliction
had been halted in the 1970s through use by artists, craft and community
groups, with the support of the Greater London Council.
''We lost that fight, but I'm a London artist and still love London,
despite what they've done to it,'' says Agis. ''Glasgow is a great city
to me too, for its open people, and I wanted to come again even though
the Mayfest budget couldn't afford to book Colourspace.''
It has cost him more than #3000 to bring his installation to Glasgow
and he has already lost half of any potential income through the licence
problem.
Mayfest organised the site and hired a generator to inflate the
structure. The generator was stolen from the site a week ago. A larger
replacement was found but there are arguments with Mayfest about who
pays for that loss. Agis also had his own publicity posters printed and
has paid Glasgow art students to distribute them.
0 Agis is no stranger to difficulties in Glasgow. At the start of the
1988 Garden Festival, he was setting up a large inflatable structure,
named Clause 28, on the water basin when a west-coast breeze tried to
blow it, and him, away. Glasgow Airport was warned about possible
hazards to low-flying aircraft and he was laid up for months with a
strained back.
Agis will probably recover from the current difficulties too. He
insists on seeing art as ''an intimate, yet shared experience'' and is
alarmed that cultural acts of individualism are rewarded by the arts
establishment while ''the act to communicate seems to have been
shelved''.
''It is public responses that suggest a direction,'' he says. ''Not
committees, galleries, museums, prizes. I have no interest in tiny
audiences posing in white cube spaces, nor art experts -- Arts Council,
curators, dealers, critics or administrators.''
He's biting the hand, of course, as he has his own share of prizes and
commissions from authorities guided by experts. But he believes local
councils, given a statutory responsibility for art provision, should
have at least one artist involved in decision-making, and says he
prefers the risks of popular taste and participation to the closeted
cultural gurus.
For next year, he is creating a mammoth Dreamspace, a cathedral-like,
eight-metres-high structure covering virtually two football pitches, for
Copenhagen when it becomes European City of Culture.
Colourspace, after it leaves Glasgow, will travel to Liverpool for a
river festival in June, the Cheltenham International Music Festival in
July and to sites in London in August.

With a bad year behind him, saxophonist Steve Williamson now has a new
album and a new band, reports Rob Adams
THE past year has been a trying time for Steve Williamson. Management
problems and record company politics, which have seriously delayed the
release of the saxophonist's third album, have lent a particularly
withering tone to his pronunciation of the word ''business''.
The follow-up to the star-studded debut A Waltz for Grace, which was
partly recorded in New York with M:BASE co-founder Steve Coleman
producing, and the rather disappointing Rhyme Time, which Williamson
himself disowned, Journey to Truth finally sees the light of day next
month. Williamson would rather not talk about it and is already looking
ahead to the next one.
Of the experience with a colleague who, without going into too much
detail, took a percentage from cheques which did not appear, Williamson
says he is getting over it.
''It cost me quite a lot of money because I was working all the time
during that period. But I'm not bitter any more. Sometimes you have to
go through these things to learn, and the reason I'm talking about it
now is so that the young players coming up will learn, too. They
shouldn't have to go through that stuff,'' he says.
Talking of young players coming up may make him sound like Old Father
Time (he is thirty-one on his next birthday), but Williamson, perhaps
because he was singled out very early in his career as a style
leader/hero figure, always seems to have had something of a paternal
attitude towards the musicians around him and those in his employ.
A product of London's burgeoning jazz scene of the mid-1980s and a
founder member of the young black British big band the Jazz Warriors, he
has wavered between reggae and funk, from idolising Charlie Parker to
saying he doesn't want to be a jazz musician anymore.
Today he does want to be a jazz musician -- but one in his own image.
''There are too many musicians who sound like other people. I'm not
putting them down for this; I used to copy John Coltrane. A lot. The
first time I heard him I thought, Jesus. It was the Live at Birdland
album, that coda on I Want to Talk About You. After that I went right
back through Giant Steps, through all the stuff with Miles, to an early
Art Blakey Big Band album he played on, and I really studied him. I
still listen to him but now I'm not interested in the notes; it's the
atmosphere, the expression I'm after.''
Williamson's new band, MODE, which stands for Metric Organisational
Diverse Elements, combines M:BASE's funk, hip hop and bebop-derived
developments with African, gospel and rhythm and blues influences.
''It's not a completely new concept but we do it our own way. I started
off with a sound in my head then I went out shopping for musicians who
could play it and that's difficult in London because if they can play
they tend to be working with everyone else and you can't get them to
commit to you.''
The biggest problem, though, he says, is finding musicians who aren't
locked into one particular style.
''Some jazz players are so set in their ways that they don't hear
anything else. But I've found a group of players who are all really open
and who all have their own musical identities. The music has its
intellectual side, its jazz side, and its funky side and if people come
along and hear it, I know one thing -- they'll enjoy themselves.''
* Steve Williamson's MODE plays at Queen's Hall, Edinburgh on Friday
May 19.

FROM time to time you see a show that refreshes you with its
child-like leaps of imagination. You see it in Communicado's current
production which is rich in simple inventiveness, and most obviously in
the lunatic playfulness of Forkbeard Fantasy.
And you'd expect to see it in this Arthurian tale performed by the
Northumberland-based company Theatre Sans Frontieres, endeavouring as it
does to tell an epic story using the simplest of theatrical tools.
Sadly, what passes as child-like in some quarters strikes me as plain
childish here.
If the production, which is directed by John Cobb of Benchtours fame,
was explicitly pitched at 14-year-olds then I would be a good deal more
sympathetic.
The story about Culhwch, a nephew of King Arthur, who sets out to
marry the daughter of a fearsome giant is as swashbuckling a yarn as
any. And I'm sure many a teenager would go a bundle on the cartoony
caricatures and the coy little nods out to the audience that come with
every vaguely funny performance.
But for an adult audience there seems to be little point to it. The
programme notes suggest that ''myths are a way of making sense of the
world,'' but what sense are we to make of a shapeless series of
diversions that exist merely to hamper our progress towards a goal that
carries with it little feeling of achievement?
There are some nice touches and there's a happy enthusiasm from the
young company -- Zannie Fraser, Tim Licata, Sarah Kemp and Cobb himself.
But it's theatre for its own sake and, as such, lacks compulsion.

THE first professional production by the highly accomplished
Castlemilk Peoples Theatre directed here by Ian Wooldridge, opened with
a striking image which offered a poignant encapsulation of the core
theme of Carl MacDougall's new play, the cruel contrast between the
innocence of childhood and the grim reality of child labour in the early
nineteenth century. While Stephen McCole excitedly enacted a skipping
game, Stevie Hannan crawled along the granite-grey stage, misery and
pain etched on his face, in a mime of a boy making a desperate ascent up
a chimney.
MacDougall eschews the pathos of a child's point of view and instead
opts for stylised slices of life in Glasgow in 1840, with references to
Irish immigration, Chartist agitation, and missionary patronage. It is
an ambitiously wide-ranging work, impressively managed with scenes of an
Irish family just off the boat, a Christian night hostel, the exhausting
work of weavers, and the risky business of sweeps subtly linked together
to create an impressionistic but cohesive narrative. This is centred on
the dreadful choice made by an Irish couple, played by Paul Riley and
Andreena Green, to sell their five-year-old son Sean into apprenticeship
with a sweep to enable them to sail to America to be reunited with their
missing daughter.
Sean is alternately played by Hannan and McCole who also slickly
juggle various other roles, as do Liam Brennan and Yvonne McLoone. The
production is distinguished by high-calibre acting, Green's Irish accent
wavers but her performance is committed and Riley is particularly
impressive at conveying a selfishness born out of genuine despair.

* THE message for young mothers that ''Breast is Best'' still has not
got through to women in Lanarkshire which has the lowest rate of
breastfeeding in Scotland. A survey carried out in 1991 shows that seven
days after birth only 21.1% of babies in Lanarkshire are still being
breastfed compared with 53.1% in Aberdeen. To combat this the
Lanarkshire Joint Breastfeeding Initiative was launched this week. As
well as a publicity campaign highlighting the benefits of breastfeeding
a number of shops in the area have agreed to display symbols confirming
that they provide suitable accommodation for breast-feeding mothers.
Further information on the work of this new health initiative from Agnes
McGowan on 01698 258800.
* CALLING all women runners taking part in this Sunday's Glasgow
Women's 10K. It's not too late to enter. You can register on the
morning, before 9.30am, at Kelvingrove Park. The race starts at 10am. If
you are looking for a good cause The Herald Campaign for Women's Health
welcomes women prepared to run on our behalf. Sponsorship forms
available from Women in Sport (0141 221 9600).
* FIND out more about homeopathic medicine for pregnancy and birth
this Saturday in Edinburgh. Speakers David Evans and Salli Rose will
explain the best remedies to choose, and how to get the most effective
results. The seminar will take place in the Basil Pettersons House, 23
Abercrombie Place, Edinburgh from 10am-4pm. Cost #20. Further
information from Elma on 01988 500 674.
* THE Sun can seriously damage your health. Yet a few simple
precautions such as wearing a sun-hat and a high-factor sunscreen can
help prevent sunburn says Christine Suggars of the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund. Their new leaflet Save Your Skin offers tips on how to
take care in the sun and points out that more than 40,000 people a year
are diagnosed with skin cancer. About 4000 will have the most dangerous
form of the disease, malignant melanoma. Copies of the leaflet are
available free from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Wallace House,
Maxwell Place, Stirling FK8 1JU.
* THE most popular form of HRT (hormone replacement therapy) in France
is now available for the first time in this country. Oestrogel, an
oestrogen containing gel, which is used by about half of all French
women who use HRT, is simply rubbed into the skin, either arms or legs,
once a day.  Derived from plant material it is simple and easy to use
and takes away menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, and night
sweats. The high French compliance rate is a further indicator that this
is a form of HRT which most French women find acceptable. Now its
available on the NHS.
* EPILEPTICS who have not had a seizure for a year are now allowed to
drive again. The change from the two-year law was officially announced
in the recent Chief Medical Officer's Update. This follows research
which shows that drivers with epilepsy were no more likely to have
accidents than the average road-user.
* A NEW study has cleared Chinese herbs of toxic risks. The research
found that Chinese herbs can produce lasting improvements in eczema
without having any side effects, according to a one-year follow-up
study. Dermatologists at the Royal Free Hospital, London, found that
Chinese herbs cleared 12 of the 17 patients with eczema and the rest
showed some improvement. The researchers recommend continued monitoring
because of the reversible changes in liver function that have occurred
in a few people taking Chinese herbs.
* PRESCRIBING exercise rather than pills for those with heart disease
not only benefits people but cuts GPs drugs bill. That's the latest
findings from LIFE, a Cheshire based health promotion initiative. They
found that a 12-week exercise programme reduced the need for medication
in one-third of those studied. Another bonus is that the combination of
exercise and communal activities lessened people's depression and
feelings of social isolation. So far more than 500 people from
Birkenhead and Wallasey practices have been referred for exercise
sessions up to three times a week. These include swimming, weight
training, keep-fit, aerobics and yoga.
* HOSPICES know all about easing death. But what about those people
who wish to die at home? A Bristol GP, Elizabeth Lee, has written a book
which guides people to a better death at home. A Good Death:  Guide for
Patients and Carers Facing Terminal Illness at Home deals with the
emotional aspects of dying, and gives advice on services available. The
book is published by Rosendale Press, price #8.99.
* OLIVE oil and citrus fruits help to reduce risk of heart disease and
more people should be encouraged to eat them says Professor Michael
Oliver of the National Heart and Lung Institute. The latest research
shows that antioxidants help in preventing and treating heart disease.
They are found mainly in Vitamin E, C and beta-carotene. In other words
fruit, nuts and oil.
* FOLLOWING interest from our readers regarding last week's mention in
Check-Up of shark oil capsules we would add that there are two further
stockists in Glasgow: the Granary Health Food Shop, 34 Busby Road,
Clarkston (0141 638 0001) and Pure Necessities, 713 Great Western Road,
Glasgow (0141 339 4455). The other stockist is Forrest and Niven, 73 St
Vincent Street, Glasgow (0141 221 7865), also in their Hamilton shop at

WITH their daughter's behaviour becoming increasingly difficult --
compounded by the turbulence experienced by any adolescent -- a
Limekilns couple desperately hope a new unit opening on Wednesday may
offer some salvation.
Diana Muirhead's 15-year-old daughter, is severely handicapped and is
also profoundly deaf. She attends a special day school in Fife. ''She
can't hear speech, can't understand signing. She understands basic
gesture but can't reciprocate it. She communicates only on a superficial
level, cut off from the world.''
St Joseph's Hospital in Rosewell has been providing music therapy for
its 97 profoundly handicapped residents for many years.
A trained music therapist looks for some behaviour -- it could be
anything from a scream, rocking movement, crying, or involuntary contact
with a musical instrument -- and ''matches'' it with a musical response
in the same tempo and idiom.
While there are a number of approaches to music therapy world wide one
of the most respected is that pioneered in England by American pianist
Paul Nordoff, who died in 1977, and by special needs teacher Clive
Robbins who now runs a clinic, with his wife, at New York University.
In 1974, the pair were invited by one of Juliette Alvin's students to
run a course at Goldie Leigh Hospital in London and in effect the first
Nordoff-Robbins (N-R) music therapy training centre was launched.
Today N-R runs five centres around the world -- the fifth about to
open in Scotland. The Rosewell location arose through a series of
fortuitous circumstances. First, two of the UK's music therapy pioneers
happen to work north of the Border. Julienne Cartwright, who practises
in East Lothian was the first N-R therapist to work with adults.
In turn, Cartwright taught Alyson Carter who has worked with St
Joseph's residents for six years and is to head the entirely separate
N-R Centre, housed in a purpose-built unit within St Joseph's complex.
N-R was keen to promote itself in Scotland. All that was missing was a
driving force, a fundraiser; that came along at a critical time in the
shape of a business manager with the National and Provincial Building
Society Edinburgh branch.
In 1993, Charles Barber's firm asked him to identify a local charity
which it could assist. His teenage daughter, aware of Wet Wet Wet's
fundraising efforts for London's N-R suggested a Scottish Music Therapy
Centre.
In the midst of a takeover the National and Provincial soon withdrew
from their involvement, but over the past two years Barber has devoted
all his spare time to continuing the task.
The new unit is the first independent music therapy centre in Scotland
and is likely to be in considerable demand.
Parents like Diana Muirhead certainly hope for its success. ''We hope
the new unit will help our daughter express herself and be an avenue for
communication,'' she says.
* Specific inquiries about the Rosewell Unit should be referred to
0131 440 4822. Broad inquiries about music therapy should be referred to
James Robertson, convener of the Scottish Music Therapy Council on 01224
283 510.

Helped by a sensitive and sympathetic hospital, Doreen Boogert tells
Ann Shaw of her personal experience of mastectomy
DOREEN Boogert learnt she had breast cancer two days before last
Christmas, and the doctor wanted her in hospital to operate the day
after Boxing Day. ''We felt our world had fallen apart,'' says
46-year-old Doreen.
Speaking at their home in Mackrie Place, Kilwinning, her husband
Alastair, who works in the wine trade, remembers the night Doreen told
him she had found a lump. ''It was a bolt out of the blue. We had no
experience of cancer or hospitals.''
They hardly slept. At nine o'clock the following dayAlastair was on
the phone to their GP arranging an emergency appointment for that
morning. Their family doctor immediately wrote a letter referring her to
Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, for further investigation, and the
appointment came for two days before Christmas.
This was the start of their encounter with cancer treatment and the
National Health Service, and they had a certain amount of misgivings.
''But attitudes have changed enormously,'' says Doreen. ''Some years
ago I had a miscarriage and I remember the insensitive way it was
handled. Today, the medical profession are much more aware of the
psychological and emotional implications of illness, particularly
cancer.''
They remember the drive to the hospital: ''From the outside it looks
like a crematorium,'' says Alastair. ''Then we walked in and got this
tremendous welcome. A very pleasant woman on the reception desk couldn't
do enough to help us. I work in the wine business and I know you would
not have got a welcome like that from many top hotels.''
Within minutes they got another pleasant surprise. A huge painting by
Archie Sutter-Watt hung outside the door of the clinic. Doreen, an
artist, has studied with Archie for the past 10 years.
''He had asked me to find out where his painting was in Crosshouse
hospital,'' says Doreen. ''I never dreamt I would see it in such
circumstances.'' She took it as a good omen. ''Seeing his painting gave
me a boost.''
She needed it because she was about to start a series of
investigations which finally ended with a mastectomy.
''I was afraid. But the hospital could not have been kinder. I was
taken through the whole procedure step by step with full consultation
and counselling.
''It started with Dr Alastair Paterson in the day clinic. As soon as I
walked in he came forward to greet me and took me by the arm. Sitting
down beside me, he said he quite understood how worried I must be. Then
he took a biospy. I know that most lumps are non-malignant so I was
hoping mine would not be. Then he asked if my husband was with me.
Immediately I knew something was seriously wrong.''
Alastair takes up the story: ''I walked into the room and looked into
the eyes of the doctor. In those three seconds I knew it was bad news.
He did not have to tell me. Doreen was crying and I nearly fainted with
shock. All I remember is someone getting me a glass of water.''
The doctor said he wanted to do a lumpectomy, (removal of the lump)
the following Tuesday. Suddenly their lives were turned upside down.
''We had never thought about cancer. It was something that had a very
low profile in our lives. Now, of course, we know a hell of a lot more
about it,'' adds Alastair. Christmas passed in a haze. They tried not to
think of he future.
''I went in for the lumpectomy and still thought that would be it,
that the cancer was localised. About a week later I was called in for
the result. They wanted to do a mastectomy and suggested I came in 10
days' time. At first I was against it.''
Doreen discussed the pros and cons with two doctors and the breast
care sister. ''I was allowed to set my own pace. We looked at the other
option of breast conservation.
''The hospital could not have been more helpful. They said I could
have as long as I wanted to think about it before making a decision.
They were anxious that it should be mine and mine alone. I could put it
off for months if I wished, or I could have it sooner.
''Eventually I decided to go for it. I thought the sooner I put it all
behind me and get on with my life as an artist the better. I felt so
calm and relaxed after I had made the decision, and that's where I felt
the hospital had really done their job well. They had taken each step at
a time, not hurried me, allowing me to make the decision.
''I spent over two hours with the breast care sister one day. I wanted
to know in detail why they thought it would be better for me to have a
mastectomy.
''Alastair said from the start that I should go for a mastectomy.
Later, I learnt from the breast care sister that sadly some women decide
against medical advice because their husbands can't bear the thought of
them without a breast.''
Doreen's attitude from the start has been extemely positive. A keen
home baker -- the couple ran the Gable End restaurant in Lochwinnoch for
eight years -- she did a big bake before going in for her mastectomy.
''I arrived in the hospital armed with food to share out between
patients, staff and her visitors.
''I was determined to make the best of it,'' says Doreen. ''I tried to
make it as pleasant for people coming to visit me as I could.''
The night before the operation Doreen had a little party in the
hospital. Meanwhile, Alastair admits he just sat at home in the dark
staring at a blank wall.
''I knew in a way it was worse for him than for me. Yet I don't think
I would have been so strong and able to cope if I had not had the
support of Alastair,'' says Doreen. The couple have always had a close
relationship, possibly made stronger by the absence of children.
On the morning of the mastectomy, as she was wheeled to the theatre,
she remembers shedding a tear for the breast she was about to lose. ''I
knew when I woke up it would be gone.''
Alaistair wondered how he would cope. ''I made a point from the start
of always washing Doreen's back in the bath. I was determined the
operation was not going to change anything.''
Doreen admits she watched his face closely to see if he flinched: he
didn't. Alastair to his surprise found that Doreen's operation did not
affect him as much as he thought it would.
Part of the package of after-care offered to patients by the hospital
is aromatherapy for up to six months, something that Doreen has found
both helpful and relaxing.
They both know it's too early to talk of a cure but they are confident
that Doreen made the right decision. She is on tamoxifen for the next
five years: ''Chemotherapy wasn't necessary because the cancer had not
spread beyond the breast and that's the good news,'' adds Doreen.
''We live in a modern world where cancer is spoken about openly.
That's one reason I wanted to tell my story, to give a positive side to
NHS treatment. So often you only hear of the times when it goes wrong.
We could not have been treated better anywhere. It was first class.
''Having cancer diagnosed is a shock to the system. You need
psychological support. The operation itself is straightforward. I was up
the following day in my track suit, determined that I was not going to
be ill a moment longer than necessary. After all, I had not felt ill
when I went into hospital.''
As a small ''thank-you'' to the hospital Doreen is donating a picture
to the ward. At a recent solo exhibition she sold 28 out of 34
paintings, not bad for a first solo show. In fact several members of the
hospital staff bought her paintings while she was in hospital.
This crisis has caused them to have a major rethink of their personal
values. ''After a shake-up like that you don't waste time. You learn to
value every minute.
''Now I am determined to get on with my life and my painting. In a
strange way a lot of good things have come out of this experience. We
are more considerate of others.
''We are both determined now in the second part of our life to be more
caring towards others. If we know of someone who is ill we ring up and
offer help and support. If they say 'no', that's fine. But we have put
out the hand of friendship and that's important when you are in ill.''
I was afraid, but the hospital could not have been kinder -- I was
taken through the whole procedure step by step
I was allowed to set my own pace -- they were anxious that the
decision should be mine and mine alone

AS politicians start to focus increasingly on the next General
Election, we can expect slanging matches about economic policy to become
even louder than normal. In the past, talk of a possible Labour
Government could usually be relied upon to instil fear into the
financial markets amid scare stories of possible sterling crises and the
like.
However, we have already had one of those under the present Tory
Government: namely September 16, 1992, when the pound was ignominiously
jettisoned from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on what has become
known subsequently as Golden Wednesday. This epithet has been given in
recognition of the welcome boost the weaker pound provided to what was
then an economy struggling to escape from recession.
Given the Tories' poor showing in the opinion polls for several months
now, the financial markets have had time to adjust -- albeit perhaps not
fully -- to the distinct possibility that the next Government may be
Labour. It is not a Labour Government as such that the markets and
business community fears, but uncertainty and instability.
Gordon Brown, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, has begun to set out
the economic policies of New Labour, but these are still far from
complete. From what has been said in the past couple of days, it is
apparent that economic policy will be based less on historical socialist
dogma and more on an understanding of what it takes for UK plc to win in
increasingly competitive world markets. As such, there could be little
in them to unsettle the markets. Since 1992 the perception has been that
Tory and Labour policies have moved closer together. This includes the
setting of inflation targets, greater autonomy with accountability for
the bank of England, and cost-effective public spending and investment.
Indeed, what comments have been made by the Labour Party so far,
including those at last week's British Chambers of Commerce annual
conference in Aberdeen, have been warmly received by the business
community.
Given that a General Election has to be held within the next two
years, there will come a time in the not-too-distant future when more
flesh will have to be put on New Labour's economic bones.
In the absence of political risk, some of the more important economic
fundamentals that help determine currency and interest rate levels
should be generally favourable come the next election. This could
include not just a stronger-than-expected economic recovery in 1996 and
1997, but in trade terms a current account close to broad balance.
Of course there is the danger that in the era of hope and optimism
following a Labour victory the current cautious stance adopted by the
Shadow Cabinet could be abandoned. If Labour wins by a large majority,
the new Government could think it had a mandate to reverse many Tory
policies. However, in areas such as trade union reform and school league
tables, it would be making a mistake.
Assuming that some of the idealism of the old Labour Party remains in
New Labour, we can expect to see policies introduced aimed at
stimulating employment and investment and redistributing income towards
the low-paid.
The case for the latter is particularly pressing given the increasing
gap between the rich and poor, which can be blamed for many of our
social ills. This is largely because people's expectations about what
they feel they are entitled to are so much greater than they were in the
past.
The mixed handling of the UK economy during 16 years of Tory rule has
meant that they can no longer claim to be the party of good economic
management. Rumours refuse to die of a difference of opinion between the
Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor over the necessity
for a rise in UK interest rates at the present time.
This has called into question the Government's economic credibility
and commitment to low inflation. The reduction of inflation to
historically low levels is one of the few visible economic benefits of
Tory rule. Given its recent drubbing in the local elections, the Tory
Party appears to have little credibility with the general electorate, so
one would have thought it could ill afford to upset its traditional
allies in the financial markets.
There is a concern that a Tory Party on the ropes will do anything to
get re-elected at the next General Election, which could jeopardise the
few economic benefits which have flowed in recent times. If so, it would
not be for the first time that the politics of boom and bust were
brought into play.

THE Government has a problem. Not a big problem -- nothing that can't
be fixed with Vaseline, tax cuts, jump leads and a rousing Sun editorial
-- but one of those dispiriting little problems that can sometimes make
you wonder what life's all about. As several ministers have confessed,
they are Failing to Get The Message Across.
As disclosures go, this one is equivalent to an insurance salesman
admitting that acts of God aren't covered in the policy. No matter how
careful you are, no matter how well you plan, there will always be a
stray bolt from the blue to screw up the picnic.
What can a poor statesman do? The implication, after all, is that
everything in the garden is lovely; that things could hardly be better
short of a state visit from the Tooth Fairy, but people just won't see
it. Reality is terrific, the Cabinet has played a blinder; it's just the
voters who require the attentions of a trained service engineer. None of
this, of course, is any fault of the Government.
They could very well be right. It is not entirely impossible that some
of us have, from time to time, mistaken deft politics for rank
incompetence, and confused the front-bench team with the Midwich
Cuckoos.
Blind to our blessings when we should have been counting them, we
haven't Got the Message.
But this raises questions, not the least of which asks where this
crucial intelligence has been hiding for 16 years. Does John Major keep
it in his wallet beside a signed photograph of a pint of warm beer? Is
it inscribed on the microdot where they store Michael Forsyth's
sensitivity? This message has proved as elusive as the Home Secretary's
definition of criminal justice.
Equally, the uncharitable might be moved to suspect that if we haven't
got the message by now, we never will. The good news, the absence of
which is preventing the nation from clutching John Major to its heaving
bosom, has taken longer to arrive than the revelation that there's no
Santa Claus. After a decade and a half, the least we might have been
entitled to expect was that the Message was in the post.
The problem, perhaps, lies in confusion over the exact nature of the
tidings involved. Like the prophecies of Fatima, the Tory Message has
come to mean different things to many different people, when it has
meant anything at all. For a minority it remains an article of faith;
for the rest it's up there with leprechauns, the Jolly Green Giant, and
the genius of Jeffrey Archer.
First we thought the message was privatisation and competition. Now we
hear that a Conservative Government will somehow privatise the railways
by pouring in vast state subsidies, while Labour sneakily turns itself
into the ''party of competition''.
Then some of us thought the Message might have something to do with
free enterprise. After a while it became clear we'd all got hold of the
wrong end of the stick. Truly free markets, it turned out, involved
monopoly utilities whose benefits could be shared with the public
according to the principles by which the Sheriff of Nottingham shared
the king's deer -- the difference being that the sheriff was never
allowed 200,000 cut-price venison-burger options.
For a while we were led to believe that the Message might have
something to do with ethics; basic values to which we would all return
faster than you could say ''good old days''. This was clear enough: the
Tory Party meant to set us all an example and, true to their word,
that's exactly what they did.
Unfortunately it wasn't quite the example as advertised, tending to
point up morals by showing what could be done with drug-laced oranges,
electric cables, lingerie, serial infidelity, unplanned parenthood, arms
dealers, and intelligent parliamentary questions (preferably under
someone else's name), made available at very reasonable rates. As
messages go, this one said: Don't Try This at Home.
Once upon a time, too, the Prime Minister liked to hint that the
Message involved open government and an improved, transparent democracy.
Indeed, he even allowed Lord Nolan to ferret out interesting things
about members' interests. This was mistaken for a brave attempt to clear
the air, erase all doubts, and put everything above board.
This week, however, we learned that his lordship could investigate
anything except the things he wanted to investigate, and certainly not
the confidential workings of the Asil Nadir Memorial Bursaries and like
charitable schemes. The emerging principle seemed to be that the public
has the right to know everything about the motives, workings and funding
of the Tory Party unless, of course, the party would rather it didn't.
Perhaps that really was the Message after all. Perhaps what ministers
have struggled by word and deed all these years to get across -- and God
knows they've almost succeeded -- is that the Tory Party is no longer
fit to be trusted with power, money or influence, and can prove it.
The Message is clear at long last: Uphold Traditional Standards of
Behaviour -- Don't Get Caught.

THE scene is the daily news conference with the Conservative candidate
at the Perth and Kinross by-election but the atmosphere is that of the
school playground.
Candidate John Godfrey has the haunted look of the terrified
first-year boy cornered by a gang of school bullies. The nation's
political correspondents queue up to administer to Godfrey Minor the
Perth by-election equivalent of a Chinese burn.
These chaps warm up for these question-and-answer sessions by pulling
wings off butterflies.
This treatment has been going on for almost two weeks now and there is
still no sign of any prefects turning up to stop the cruelty.
So bewildered has the Tory candidate become that he is now going round
the doors advising electors to vote against the Government, as long as
it's not for the SNP.
The Tory stage set is a blue box. All it needs is some wire mesh on
the front to complete the caged animal look. The Perth Hunt met
yesterday afternoon but their day out having their hounds rip foxes to
bits is humane compared to what is happening to Godfrey Minor.
Labour candidate Douglas Alexander is also schoolboyish of mien. But
efforts by the bullies to inflict political pain on him come to nothing.
Young Alexander has obviously had plenty of practice at the school
debating society. The by-election bullies complain that he begins almost
every question with ''Quite clearly . . .'' and then proceeds to obscure
the issue quite beautifully. Surely to be expected in a politican.
One of the hacks plans to ask Alexander where he stands on
prevarication. Quite clearly, he will be either for or against it.
Over at the SNP, we have Roseanna, the candidate formerly known as
Cunningham. The surname has been dropped from posters, apparently, and
it's plain Roseanna.
The bullies show they are not averse to teasing the girls. But
Roseanna is very much the head girl and will have none of it.
She dismisses the oiks' questions with a haughty laugh and quotes from
the SNP's Book of Soundbites.
Godfrey Minor, in an attempt to draw the attention of the bullies to
someone else in the playground, has labelled Roseanna ''Republican
Rose''. This is just another example of Tory hyperbole, she says. Surely
more alliteration than hyperbole, Roseanna, and no English prize for you
this year.
Having been convicted of being a republican, Roseanna now stands
accused of being a socialist. Again, she says it's a fair cop. She is in
favour of pensions, jobs, houses, a national health service and is
against poverty, unemployment, sickness, and sending children up
chimneys except under stringent safety conditions.
The last of the Big Four candidates is Veronica Linklater of the
Scottish Liberal Democrats. To carry on the school analogy, Veronica is
very much the teacher, perhaps the English teacher.
The Lib-Dems talk about her campaign being ''literature-driven''.
What? Quoting extracts from famous Scottish authors such as her
pa-in-law Eric? Unfortunately not. It is apparently a reference to an
abundance of leaflets.
We had been told by the SNP dirty tricks department that if you close
your eyes while Veronica is speaking you might think you were listening
to Margaret Rutherford. This is only very slightly true.
She looks and sounds just like a very perfect Perthshire lady.
And compassionate too. She took time to say how sorry she felt for
Godfrey Minor and how, even though he is the Tory candidate, she would
like to give him a wee encouraging pat on the head.
Whereas Godfrey Minor's political naivety is painful, Veronica's is
refreshing. The political correspondents asked her to spout forth on the
subject of a minimum wage. She confessed this topic was not her strong
point and suggested that her political minder might answer.
If Godfrey Minor had made such a response to the bullies he would have
got a dead leg in a minute.
The minder, Archy Kirkwood MP, first told us all about the Lib-Dem
minimum wage policy which, as you probably already knew, is based on
regional variations. He then commented on how interesting it was to have
a candidate who was not a professional career politician. (No, that
doesn't necessarily mean Veronica is an amateur with no career
prospects.)
Did that mean we would be better off without career politicians such
as, for instance, Archy Kirkwood MP. No, butted in Veronica, we would
need regional variation.
Recipe for disaster
THE journalists who are currently terrorising the candidates at Perth
and Kinross are not averse to biting the hand that feeds. The
Conservatives, whose news conference begins at the ungodly hour of
8.45am at the Isle of Skye hotel, offer bacon rolls.
The SNP at the Salutation lay on a selection of shortbread. We are not
sure whether or not the tin is tartan. Labour at the Station opt for a
selection of your average hotel biscuits.
By the time you have arrived at the Waverley Hotel for the Lib-Dems,
the sun is almost over the yardarm and there is a tempting decanter of
Harveys Bristol Cream on the reception. And a bowl of mint imperials for
those succumb.

IN THE dining-room of our hotel in Albufeira last week a Scotsman
turned to his recently acquired English friend and pointed a finger in
my direction. ''That,'' he announced, ''is one of our Tories!'' We will
have to wear brands on our heads soon.
The news of the English and Welsh local elections massacre -- a result
which made the St Valentine's Day events in Chicago seem like a minor
upset -- were relayed to me in Spain, mainly by gleeful Scottish rugby
players. In Portugal I reflected on the debacle and our own mauling at
the feet of the electorate during the previous month, when we also
received, as a World Cup prop put it, ''a good kicking''.
While I reflected upon it all, and just as I emerged from the swimming
pool, I caught sight of John Major, via satellite television, addressing
the Scottish Tory Party conference from snowy Glasgow. That made me feel
a lot better . . . that I was in the Algarve.
The PM appeared to be asking for ideas: indeed we, the people, are
supposed to write the next manifesto it would seem. Well I have said
more than enough about devolution, but I thought I might try out a
couple of other suggestions.
There was but one winner in the local elections in Scotland, England
and Wales -- no, not the Labour Party, but the party of apathy. The hard
fact is that the majority of people do not give a damn about who runs
their councils.
Maybe they are quite right to feel that way. For what vital decisions
are left to local authorities these days? How much to raise and how much
to spend? Not likely. It is the Government, which supplies some 84% of
the cash used by councils, which largely dictates the size of the bills.
Capping, or just the threat of it, is the best example ever of the piper
calling the tune.
A decade or more ago I recall a conversation I had on this topic with
my good friend Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, then as now a junior
minister at the Scottish Office.
''You know, James,'' I confided, ''rate-capping -- as it was then --
really worries me, because you are taking away the Conservatives'
greatest weapon in any local debate. If the Labour Party can switch the
responsibility for spending levels to the Government, why should people
have to vote Tory locally in order to curb rate rises?'' James nodded
politely, as only he can. ''Don't worry,'' he assured me, ''it will only
be used as a last resort.''
Not since 1982, when we took over the adminstration of Lothian
Regional Council following four years of rocketing rates under Labour,
has the level of local taxation been a prime issue in any council
election. In fact, I do not believe there has been a municipal election
in the past 15 years where any local matter has materially affected the
result.
So my first recommmendation to John Major's Westminster worthies is
quite simple: get out of local government, or at least reverse the
proportions so that 84% of the cash for councils is raised locally.
To agree that takes no great U-turn by the Tories. We are, after all,
supposed to be supporters of decentralisation. Instead, ever since the
latter days of Margaret Thatcher, we have hogged power at the centre
better than any Supreme Soviet ever did.
Give local government back to the locals. Let them pay for it; decide
which services they want; reward thrift and punish waste; vote in the
canny; vote out the junketers . . . just vote, for a change.
The Treasury will go mad; you will be told the balance of the economy
will be disturbed, that any relaxation of controls will result in chaos.
No, it will result in democracy.
Remember, local authorities need not raise the cash they require by a
property tax alone. Sales taxes, local income taxes, tourist taxes, and
many more, are available to them. Why not make them accountable again?
My second notion, as uncontroversial as ever, is one which would put the
bite -- even some interest -- back into local government.
Announce now, John, that you intend to introduce proportional
representation, using the single transferable vote system, at the next
round of council polls. Imagine Paddy's face: his best policy whipped
from beneath his feet. Think of Tony, desperate as ever to avoid making
a policy decision, struggling to react. His flabber would be as gasted
as Gordon Brown's was in the House the other day.
And why should we take this step? Because the world and his granny
knows it makes sense.
Why should the new Edinburgh authority be controlled by the
socialists, with a sizeable majority, having only secured 40.66% share
of the vote at last month's elections? Why should the SNP attract 17.2%
of the voters in the city and win not a single seat? Or, indeed, looking
at the whole of Scotland, why should Labour control 20 out of 29
councils with a 43.57% share of the vote? It is utter madness.
PR may not help the Tories to gain control of many councils -- few
will want to ally with us at the moment -- but it will help the people
to do so. Local democracy might just be worth voting for. For there is
nothing quite so boring, and pretentious, as a council in the grip of
the Labour Party. It makes synchronised draughts seem riveting.
I do not pretend that these two measures will bring the Conservatives
a rich electoral return. A little respect would not go down too badly,
however.
Anyway, I cannot hang around here chatting. By the time you read this
I shall be in the Republic of South Africa. Of their exciting politics I
will talk to you over the next few weeks.

AS a journalist I am well aware of the need for papers to use
contentious columnists, but I have always made a point of not ever
writing a letter or article in reply, as it more often than not merely
encourages the self-opinionated ravings of the columnist and keeps the
newspaper's letters page mailbag full.
However, the latest offering from John Macleod in Tuesday's Herald --
''Time to hand over Falklands'' -- has compelled me to break with habit.
As a former editor of the Falklands' newspaper, I can only say the
article was inaccurate, facile, naive, and didn't even address some of
the major issues affecting the islands and their inhabitants. Macleod's
rose-tinted spectacles view of the Argentina of today made matters
worse.
While I agree the growth of democracy in this beautiful country is
welcome, and should be lauded and encouraged, it is still young and
tender. To say Los Disparados have been avenged is both incorrect and
insulting to the thousands of loved ones of missing people who took to
the streets of Buenos Aires only last week.
But let me confine the arguments to the issues affecting the
Falklands. The question of sovereign rights over the islands is not, in
the final analysis, a difficult one. At different times, France,
Britain, Spain, the collection of states which became Argentina, and
even America, have had forays into the islands. Spain was handed the
Falklands by France in 1766, but Britain had a colony there
simultaneously, and had also claimed them.
The Spaniards drove out the British in 1769 only to let them return in
1771 to avoid all-out war. Both quit the islands in the years that
followed, but it was the British who returned. With the parting of Spain
from her South American dominions in 1810, following four years of
revolution, the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata (later
Argentina) claimed jurisdiction over the islands, and that is the sole
base of their existing claim.
The longest and most sustained period of government has come from the
British, with many of the present islanders being of British descent, or
having been born in Britain.
The logic that a country which lies on the same continental shelf as a
larger, more powerful neighbour should be ruled by it, would cause
international havoc if it were to be adopted across the globe. It is an
argument which overrides all cultural and historical precedent and
smacks of imperialism as larger countries divide the tasty morsels of
smaller countries and colonies among themselves.
Before going any further, let's clear up the quesion of the supposed
''crippling public cost, maintaining an arsenal of weaponry and a
garrison of soldiers to defend something not very important from
something not very nasty''. Per head of population, the Falklands is a
relatively wealthy colony from self-generated income. Despite a fall in
the world market they make a healthy income from wool, have a
potentially lucrative fishery (which in the early days saw them absorb a
#9m deficit from a failed British company), and a naturally resourceful
and entrepreneurial culture.
In exchange for #30m of overseas development money given to the
Falklands' government, the British military have developed a military
base with some of the best training facilities available to our troops.
In exchange, the islands gain a defensive shield and have striven to
develop a more diverse and self-supportive economy behind it. The
success of this can be seen in contributions the locals have made to the
maintenance of the military presence, including the construction of a
swimming pool at the base.
Which brings me to the point of considering whether we would be doing
the best for the Falklanders by even considering handing over the
islands to Argentina. What happened to the cherished British principle
of the rights of the individual? If we are so keen to part with the
islands, why not help them develop their diversity of economy further
and then negotiate to give them protectorate status -- similar to Belize
-- maybe with them paying a portion of the defence costs and leading to
a final date for full autonomy?
The culture of the islands is so ''British'' that the Falklanders
would never be able to sit comfortably under Argentine rule. They fully
recognise they may have to have closer ties, but sovereignty is another
matter. They have survived some 13 years now with no trade with
Argentina, using instead the more friendly ports of Punta Arenas in
Chile and the international freeport of Montevideo in Uruguay. Agreed,
Argentina is less nasty these days, but it will take a lot more time
before there can be anything approaching full trust between the
Falklanders and the Argentinians.
As to the importance of the islands, this is where John Macleod really
misses the point. The Falklands is one of Britain's main reasons for a
legitimate claim to a share of Antarctica. Lord Shackleton, son of the
famous Antarctic explorer and author of reports on the Falklands, once
told me that Britain's withdrawal from Antarctica would result in Chile
and Uruguay declaring war on each other over claims to the ice. Chile
already sends children to be schooled on the ice to claim usage, while
Argentina sends pregnant women there to claim birthright.
If we have any serious intention of being part of the powers which
will protect the last green wilderness on earth, we must maintain our
claim. Even if we merely want a share of the rich resources there, the
same applies. Indeed, there may be oil and limited mineral deposits in
the Falklands themselves. The Americans also see a strategic importance
in the islands, as they represent an unsinkable aircraft carrier off
South America. It is well-known to Falklanders that the Americans
annually have sea trials with all South American nations, and have seen
practice landings and take-offs with their large Galaxy aircraft at the
MPA base on the islands.
And last, but certainly not least, I and many others lost friends and
relatives in the conflict of 1982. The reasons for this war were given
as the defence of the freedom of the islanders and their right to have
the government of their choice. For the sake of their memory alone, it
is far too early even to contemplate disposing of the islands like some
diplomatic pawn. While I, too, wish President Carlos Menem well with the
continued growth of democracy in his country, let's help Falklanders
make their islands a peaceful, safe place for them to enjoy the
government of their choice.

YET another Kirk report, Ignorance a barrier to faith (May 10). The
Church of Scotland is always wondering why. Numbers are falling, why?
Finance is falling, why? Belief is diminishing, why?
Is not the answer plain; its wounds are self-inflicted and the Lord of
the Church has removed the candlestick from the midst in all but a few
evangelical faithful ministries which are notable because they flourish
contrary to the general trend.
The article speaks of secularism; for generations the Church has been
appointing churchgoing but unconverted men to the eldership becuse of
their secular standing and influence rather than their spiritual
qualities. Men (and now women) have been able to enter upon full-time
ministry out of a sense of vocation or as a chosen profession rather
than a true profession of faith and a manifest calling of God
accompanied by indications of gifts in biblical exposition and ministry.
These same men have turned from the historic basis of faith -- the
Westminster Confession (proving itself from the Bible) -- even denying
at high level the essential and fundamental truths of the Christian
faith as well as the miracles.
Women have invaded the eldership contrary to the express and implied
teaching of scripture. Are Sunday School teachers real Christians with a
bible message? And the Church of Scotland continually wonders why.
God will not be mocked -- he will withdraw His Holy Spirit from all
such. And the man or woman in the street is not fooled; they know sham,
a mere ''form of godliness but denying the power thereof''.
The Church has taken to preaching politics and social remedies in
recent times but the gospel (addressing all as sinners needing to repent
and seek salvation through the shed blood of Christ) is the only thing
that will change the lives of individuals and act as light and salt
among the putrefaction that sin causes in society.
It is because of the progressive spiritual malaise from children up to
politician that we are now afflicted with Sunday trading, sports,
recreation, and the loss of the sanctity of the Lord's Day further
aggravating the destruction of family life and church witness.
What is needed is repentance; a purging away of the dross; and a
return to a true and vital historic biblical fiath under Godly men.
Without it, the Church of Scotland will continue to wither and die,
unquestionably.

I AM grateful to the Rev W J McMillan for his response to my letter
(Baptism, May 2).
While not wishing to observe the loss of traditional procedures in the
Church of Scotland it would appear that many younger people attending
the Church enjoy a more informal form of worship.
This may well be reflected in their life style as well as their
approach to the Church in general. Either way the Cbhurch could well be
considered to be closing its door on potential members if it adheres to
its strict club rules of eligibility to infant baptism.

I WOULD like to correct some factual points in your article, Reality
dawns at Camelot (April 28).
First, Camelot always expected to make a profit in the first year,
that is to say to March 31, 1995. Full and detailed results will be
published in June.
Secondly, the early advertising which referred to the Good Causes (and
it would have been a little bizarre not to have done so since that was
the primary purpose of setting up the lottery in the first place) was
not the subject of warnings from Oflot or anyone else. Indeed a
complaint to the Advertising Standards Commission was thrown out.
Thirdly, sales, although higher than expected, are certainly not #62m
a week higher and start-up costs were not #30m but in total are well in
excess of #100m already.
Finally, the average split of sales over the seven years of the
licence will be 50% in prizes, 12% in duty, 28% to the Good Causes, 5%
to the retailers, and 5% to Camelot to cover all of its operating costs
and generate any profit.

I AM writing on behalf of trade union members at the National
Engineering Laboratory (NEL), East Kilbride, to draw attention to
another of Mr Heseltine's increasingly desperate attempts to find
something in his Government's bargain basement that he can actually
sell.
NEL was advertised for sale in December last year. But what exactly is
on offer and at what price the staff at NEL do now know. On advice from
private sector consultants, information about the sale and the potential
bidders is being kept secret. This obviously causes deep suspicion
amongs staff, who have also been forbidden from openly expressing their
preferences.
We do agree with management when they say that NEL staff are its major
asset. The skills, expertise, and excellence embodied in the people
employed at the laboratory are being touted and ''anonymised staff
data'' has been made available to potential buyers.
At the very least, staff have the right to expect that they would be
allowed to discuss the sale with the potential bidders. The Treasury's
own guidelines say, ''It is desirable that trade-union representatives
have the opportunity to meet with short-listed bidders.''
However, these same people whose expertise and goodwill Mr Heseltine
is desperate to sell are being refused any access to their potential
future employers. The staff only wish to be asssured that they have a
future. They would like the opportunity to express their preference for
the buyer who is most likely to provide that.
What has Mr Heseltine got to hide that makes it necessary for him to
ignore Treasury's own advice regarding consultation between staff and
short-listed bidders?
What have the short-listed bidders got to lose in talking to the staff
at NEL before submitting their bid? If they really want the support of
the staff, both for their bid and as future employees, why not persuade
the staff now that they have a bright future?

I WAS surprised and encouraged by the response from readers on my
letter about Scottish awareness to the learning of modern languages (May
11). Their letters did much to broaden the debate about a subject which
I feel is very much the key to our future in Europe and beyond.
Peter Alexander asks the sensible question why French is always given
prominence. I hope my French friends and modern language specialists in
the subject will forgive me if I point out that, since the early 1960s,
greater numbers of Scots have chosen Spain (rather than France) as a
holiday destination and continue to do so.
Why do we still teach French in preference to Spanish? How many
children on holiday with their parents have lost out on the thrill and
enjoyment of speaking a foreign language because the Scottish Education
Department seems to have ingored this basic fact?
The reasons are probably historical and customary more than anything
else, but it does seem to suggest a remarkably blinkered attitude to
obvious trends.
John McLellan describes the situation where instinctive understanding
played a part, followed by a grammatical explanation. Motivation was the
key. This is surely the essence of the entire question. Whether or not
we have taken the trouble to learn a foreign language, our basic needs
are the same and invite translation.
I have used transliterated phrase books, sign language, a world map,
and a piece of paper while travelling on the Chinese railways and been
delighted by the response.
I'm sure many of your readers have had similar experiences. But I
would have preferred to have been able to communicate at a more
sophisticated level.
James Sheffield describes his encounter with a tourist guide who
seemed to be out of depth in a foreign language. I hope the gesture
rather than the doubtful expertise was appreciated to some extent by the
tourist group, although I think his point extremely important.
The Scottish Tourist Guides Association is very much aware of
shortcomings in this area and is currently involved in a recruiting
drive to increase the number of foreign language specialists.
Given that tourism is now major factor in the Scottish economy I would
hope that foreign languages in schools will be given a much greater
sense of urgency if we are to match the kind of language welcome offered
us abroad.
Just as important, if we want to sell something overseas, we cannot
continue to hide behind the hegemony of the English language with all
its associations of imperialism and assumed priority status.
I echo Peter Alexander's comments. Quite apart from European
languages, I suggest that our efforts should be moving towards Japanese,
Arabic, Russian, and Chinese if we want to count ourselves as being
truly international traders.

THE members of the Iona Community's Tayside Family Group are extremely
concerned that, on the recommendation of the assembly council, this
year's General Assembly of the Church of Scotland is to be asked to
reduce drastically the number of industrial missioners in Scotland
funded by the Church of Scotland.
Obviously we are aware of, and fully understand, the assembly
council's desire to husband the Kirk's resources and to focus them on
clear priorities. We believe strongly that one of those priorities
continues to be industrial mission throughout the main industrial
centres of Scotland, and that Tayside is one of those centres.
We know from our experience in and around Dundee that the industrial
missioner clearly wins respect and friends for the Church in areas of
life and work where others have no such opportunity. He is often the
starting point for a link that brings back into the life of the Church
some of those who have drifted away.
He touches the work of people who in so many ways feel undervalued and
insecure, and in an indefinable yet real way adds value.
As we each go about our own work and activity in Tayside we have been
impressed by the many people in public and business life who have
commented on the value of the industrial missioner's work and who have
strongly regretted that the Kirk should be contemplating removing the
post from Tayside.
As members and associates of the Iona Community we are part of a long
and close association with industrial mission in Scotland. We are
saddened that the hard-won advances the Church has made in industrial
mission should now be in jeopardy.
We urge the assembly council to find ways to guide the General
Assembly to maintain its contribution to industrial mission at least in
the areas in and around Scotland's four main cities.

BEFORE Glasgow assumes its mantle as City of Architecture, and well
before anything new is built, it must surely decommission -- ie,
dynamite -- two of its most outrageous follies.
Both are bridges: the pink plastic horror which straddles the
underpass at Charing Cross, and the bizarre, brick gangway which serves
no purpose other than allowing RSAMD students traffic-free access over
Renfrew Street to the upper echelons of the Savoy Centre.
None of its stalls would seem to stock instruments, scores, editions
of Shakespeare or leotards. This hideous, useless thoroughfare merely
clutters the facade of the RSAMD building.
But now a whole new edifice is, apparently, surplus to requirements --
the Royal Concert Hall. After experiencing Britten's War Requiem in the
Shed (May 14) it is surely obvious that this building is all Glasgow
needs as a concert venue -- large capacity, wonderful sound, rivalling
the Maltings at Snape, rendering the quietest timbre audible, orchestral
sound warm and balanced, choral sound immediate, and when appropriate,
overwhelming -- in fact, everything the GRCH will never produce.
The Shed has exciting, conspiratorial gloom, prohibiting
programme-flicking, hard (albeit dusty) seats, and a cool breeze, both
prolonging altertness and concentration, a fast bar, and a
wonderful-value sit-where-you-like concert for #5.
The roadway outside must be pedestrianised, and the very junior
attendants urged to reduce their ''Guard yer caur, sur?'' rates.
The GRCH, not the splendid City Chambers, must become the new museum.
The enfranchised of Glasgow will surely never allow their George Square
spendour to be decomissioned as international visitors are toured around
Strathclyde House.
Councillors need spendour; concertgoers just the music.

DAVID BELCHER does it again. It makes you wonder whether he has a
natural talent to alienate an audience or if he has to work at it very
hard.
His analysis of Mary-Chapin Carpenter's performance at the Royal
Concert Hall in Glasgow smacked of resentment and carried the same
characteristic negative smugness that seems to be a hallmark of his
writing (May 15).
It is surely disappointing that his article failed to convey the drive
and excitement of her music and her rare talent to share a common
experience with her audience through her telling lyrics. Thankfully
these talents were more fully appreciated by the rest of her audience.
That most of his article referred to the Partick Thistle/Rangers match
earlier in the day suggests he just simply hadn't done his homework on
Mary Chapin's music. It was obviously easier for him to write about
something he does claim to know about.
Or maybe it was just a packed Concert Hall that intimidated David
Belcher. Perhaps in future he should stick to the open terraces of
Firhill.

IT is not a happy time for policemen, policing and, by extension, the
vulnerable general public. This much and a good deal more can be
gathered from Chief Constable Leslie Sharp's Herald Town and Gown
lecture last night. Although he has not given his reasons in public for
his early retiral it is possible to trace a trail of discontent and
outright anger within the Strathclyde force in relation to recent
Government policies. Whether Mr Sharp was simply unwilling to continue
the fight against reforms and the impact of market forces, or whether he
simply did not want to be associated with them, is not known. But if
that is the reason behind his departure and the concerns which he raised
in his speech, he is far from alone. An English chief constable has
already announced that he will not accept a fixed contract, as proposed
by the Government, because it would be against his principles. Many
other senior officers applaud this decision, and they are right to
reject such a repugnant rag of imported dogma. The Police Federation
meeting this week has been told in addition that the police service is
demoralised, undermanned, and being downgraded by stealth. While there
is undoubtedly a degree of understandable hyperbole in some of this,
there is equally not the slightest doubt of the danger that policing in
Britain as we understand it, and as we wish to retain it, is under
serious threat from Government ideological reforms.
It is, of course, reasonable to demand that the performance of the
police forces should be examined and assessed. By a strange sleight of
hand the Government has managed to suggest that this is its own idea. It
is nothing of the sort. All good police forces have assessed themselves
for many years, and have also been subjected to external professional
assessment. The trouble with the performance indicators which the
Government insist on applying is that they have everything to do with
market reforms and budget cuts, but little to do with good policing.
The area of most concern is the attempt to privatise policing by the
encouragement of private security firms and unpaid volunteers patrolling
the streets with little knowledge or understanding of what they are
doing. It seems likely, if distinctly lunatic, that the Government will
attempt to transform the ''eyes and ears'' approach of Neighbourhood
Watch into something approaching citizen patrols. Again, this pernicious
approach to policing has everything to do with reducing state
involvement (and financing) of those areas of national life which are
basic to our culture and wellbeing. Mr Sharp paints an alarming picture
of the contracting out of police services, of private security firms,
often of the most dubious nature and without any regulation, being
employed to protect people and property. We should be clear about what
is intended here; it is the downgrading of traditional and effective
police work in this country for the purposes of saving money for the
Treasury. The result will be private policing and public alarm. Consider
this; if the police are worried and disaffected, it will be as nothing
to the anger of communities which find themselves without the protection
taken for granted for so long.

FRANKLIN D. Roosevelt's personal advisor, Harry Hopkins, famously and
favourably, defined the left-wing attitude to public money as ''Spend,
spend spend''. It was a commitment which persisted for a long time both
in this country and the United States where Labour and Democrats alike
favoured high spending budgets even if these involved considerable
borrowings. Mr Gordon Brown, the Shadow Chancellor, firmly rejected that
policy yesterday insisting that the cost effectiveness of public
spending would have to be demonstrable before it was incurred and that a
future Labour Government's borrowing would be only for purposes of
investment. In place of the Hopkins formula Brown's Law (as he himself
dubbed it) identified ''prudent investment for growth'' as a guideline
and forsesaw close co-operation between the public and private sectors
in many areas where Labour would previously have thought of the state
automatically operating on its own. This sustained policy statement will
reassure many observers -- and voters -- who may still fear that any
future Labour Government would resort to increased public spending
financed both by higher taxation and higher public borrowing as well as
by higher revenues from an expanding economy. Mr Brown's accompanying
strictures on inflation reinforce the impression he meant to convey.
There is little doubt that in promise at least a Blair administration
would start off very differently from any of its predecessors since
1945.
Yet the difference will not include a Bank of England with an
independent remit for the conduct of monetary policy. Mr Brown has ideas
for the bank's future. He is unhappy with the way the meetings between
the Chancellor and the Governor have become a sort of ''Ken and Eddie
show'', and wants instead a much reinforced committee with the Governor,
his deputy, and six other officials of the bank (all appointed by the
Government) to make recommendations for monetary policy. How very
British to imagine that radical innovation begins with a committee. How
much is changed by having such a body rather than the present
arrangement is hard to see. The Governor almost certainly consults such
people already before he presents his views to the Chancellor, who, as
was seen earlier this month, has the last word. Mr Brown's
recommendations would still leave himself with the last word.
Mr Brown may come to different conclusions if he ever is Chancellor,
and not just the Shadow. It is interesting that Mr Clarke's two Tory
predecessors almost immediately after leaving office announced their own
conversion to the notion of the bank's independence. And Mr Clarke has
gone some way in their direction by promoting ''the Ken and Eddie
show''. That need not be despised -- personalising the handling of
monetary policy can focus popular attention on its conduct, and
communicate some of its intricacies to a wider audience than ever
before: politics is dry and uninteresting without a degree of
preoccuption with personality; indeed personality is essential to the
virility of democratic politics. The cost of money and the extent of
inflation are matters of great moment, and important for almost every
citizen. It is an undoubted achievement of Mr Clarke's to have made
their consideration more visible (and so more open to criticism) than
ever before. The main fact is that Mr Brown has really come out against
an independent central bank on the model of the German Bundesbank, and
that may comfort Labour supporters who believe his views to be too
right-wing, for that prescription is a deeply conservative one. Its
rejection may, however, qualify  the strength of Labour's hostility to
inflation, the one area where the Bundesbank's independence has achieved
a remarkable and consistent success.

I NOTE with interest that a leading police spokesman has announced an
inquiry into the causes of crime. This is a welcome change from trying
to find cures.
Such an inquiry must involve trained sociologists and the police being
trained to have an open mind. It is difficult to see that they can come
to any other conclusion than that crime is endemic to capitalist
society.
Capitalism is only a passing phase in the history of society and has
now outlived its usefulness. It will take time to re-adjust the
lumpenproletariat, but the sooner this begins the better.
The next change in society must surely be socialism, which is easy to
understand, given a will to do so. It has been described as ''From each
according to their ability. To each according to their needs.''

THE Glasgow geneticist did not want to be named. No wonder! Evolution,
he says, has equipped the human species for levels of adultery halfway
between the chimpanzee and the gorilla.
''If you compare the relative testes sizes of the higher apes,
including ourselves, the chimp has relatively enormous testes and is
highly promiscuous.
''The gorilla has relatively tiny testes: one-sixteenth the size of
the chimp's, relative to body mass, and leads a low-key sex life of
exemplary fidelity.
''The human male's testes are about halfway in proportion between the
two. Presumably, then, we should be something like a highly sexed
gorilla or an under-sexed chimp.''
His observations are not, despite the plea for anonymity, the product
of his own first-hand research on genetic imperatives to adultery. They
are drawn from the recent work of an Oxford University researcher whose
seminal work has been on the relatively sized genitalia of the higher
primates.
So what does measuring up to the apes tell us about predisposition to
playing away from home? Aside from reinforcing the pitiful secret fear
that everyone else is at it and they have bigger ones, is infidelity
innate? Just a genital itch? Is scratching it a genetically determined
imperative, or a new, exciting excuse for some straightforward,
old-fashioned, caddish adultery?
These are just some of the questions the Bishop of Edinburgh was not
trying to answer in what might have been, but wasn't, billed as the
Sermon on the Mount. The Most Reverend Richard Holloway, primus of the
Scottish Episcopal Church, tells us that -- like many, many men before
him -- he is misunderstood. He does not condone infidelity. He just
wanted to explain why the church should not condemn but understand the
adulterer. It's written in the genes.
It was the bishop's attempts to outline the content of the first of
his four seminars on Christianity and the Sexual Revolution that led him
astray. He blames his naivety and the temptations of verbal intercourse
with the unfortunate reporter who first attempted to relay his complex
syntactical exploration of the tensions created by what's in your genes
and what's in your mind, entitled, interestingly, What is Sex For?
It was, of course, a rhetorical question. The bishop, who has a
charming American wife and three children, knows fine. He was, he says,
merely trying to explain the creative tension inherent in what he calls
the genetic versus the moral imperative in human sexuality. Or, put
another way, whether men can help it.
''Look, there may be something in what the guy says,'' the shy
geneticist sighed. ''It may be the potential for adultery is in
everyone's genes. There again, the potential for adultery is in a
goldfish's genes.'' Sorry? Goldfish? Chimps? Gorillas? Tim Yeo? Rupert
Pennant-Rea? The geneticist was in danger of being misunderstood by your
correspondent, who failed to grasp the connection between fish, flesh,
and the foul deeds of adulterous swine.
So he spoke more slowly and very, very clearly: ''Genes give us the
potential for behaviour, not the behaviour itself; so that anyone who
talks about having genes for specific behaviour is grossly
over-simplifying the situation. The human species has got where it has
by not having specific behaviour hard-wired into us, but the potential
to modify your behaviour in regard to what you learn. So it's somewhat
naive to say it's in your genes.
''The potential is there, but how you experience that potential, or
demonstrate it, or work out your own behaviour is very much controlled
by your environment and other factors in what goes on around you.''
Fidelity it would seem, if you believe surveys involving sex are more
than boasting, has been reduced to a social anachronism. These days 37%
of marriages end in divorce, with 41.8% of husbands and 23.2% of wives
citing adultery as the cause. Robert Wright's recent book The Moral
Animal, argued that humans are genetically compelled to be unfaithful.
Steve Jones, on the other hand, author of the Language of the Genes,
derides the suggestion that genes are to blame for promiscuity.
Human behaviour, he says, has long since transcended the genetic code.
''For a churchman whose only expertise is in morals to make callow and
half-informed scientific judgments beggars belief.''
A recent poll on social and sexual issues, conducted by NOP, appeared
to show that the British have become markedly more tolerant in their
attitude to adultery. Fewer than half the population believe it is
''always wrong''. And 10% of the those surveyed believed that a married
person having intercourse with someone other than their partner was
''not at all wrong''. Only 1.5% held the same opinion in 1983. The
proportion believing adultery is ''always'' wrong declined from 59% in
1983 to 44% today.
According to Relate, a relationship counselling service, the survey
figures may reflect the fact that 60% of men and 40% of women say they
have affairs, even though they go into marriage saying they will not.
It might be pertinent to wonder how researchers elicit such figures?
Have you ever been stopped outside Asda by a woman armed with a
ballpoint and a fierce look to help in a survey on infidelity?
Cecil Parkinson, Michael Aspell, Tim Yeo, Robert Hughes, Earl of
Caithness, Alan Clarke, David Mellor, Hartley Booth -- are these men,
then, like the bishop, simply misunderstood. Might they be merely the
victims of their genes?
''The idea that adultery is based on man's natural desire to procreate
is crazy,'' says Paula Milne, who wrote and researched The Politician's
Wife. ''Procreation is the last thing on the mind of an adulterous
man.''
Bang goes another excuse.

HYPOCRISY and sex go together like a horse and carriage. Like love and
marriage, it would appear we can't have one without the other. However,
the latest instance of hypocrisy and sex involves breaking the link
between love and marriage. It concerns adultery. The A-word has the
distinction of having one of the 10 commandments all to itself. It is at
the centre of the incident in the Gospels when a woman is saved by Jesus
from death by stoning as a punishment for her adultery, and then told:
''Go and sin no more.'' It is cited as the only permissible ground for
divorce in another Gospel passage.
Adultery is sex without marriage -- and outwith it. Bishop Richard
Holloway has speculated that much of it is caused by sex drives which
are innate to us as mammals, and should be viewed with tolerance for
that reason. He does not condone it, but wants us to be more forgiving
towards it.
That is where the hypocrisy comes in. ''Bishop says bonking OK outside
marriage'' was the kind of headline which some newspapers were running
yesterday in advance of Bishop Holloway's lecture in St Cuthbert's last
night. Such coverage is two-faced, in that it offers two faces of church
leaders -- and bishops in particular. They are pharisees, puritans,
fuddy-duddies or else trendies, heretics or sex-crazed fiends.
There is no hypocrisy in Dick Holloway. In the 25 years I have known
him, he has gone far up the slippery pole of ecclesiastical advancement
but remains the same talented human being. His candour matches his
humour and his books and broadcasts weigh heavily in quality as well as
quantity. His latest area of concern has been the way in which the
church stifles the spiritual by cruel, judgmental attitudes.
He explored this in Churches and How to Survive Them, a brilliantly
perceptive dialogue. Now he is flying one of his favourite kites on a
longer string. Richard Holloway is not afraid to allude to sexual issues
from the pulpit. I remember him once at a confirmation service, not long
after he became a bishop, likening first communion to a first kiss
awkwardly won in the back seat of a cinema. That can be a dangerous
strategy. Mentioning sex in the pulpit is to run the risk of being
misheard, misunderstood and then miscalled. By playing with fire, he has
been burnt in effigy.
The problem for any preacher who deals with sexuality is to avoid
coming over as either Holy Willie or heretic. The best solution is to
stay silent and have greater flexibility when the preacher is required
to become a pastor and deal face-to-face in private with those who have
sinned or have been sinned against. The difficulty is that this approach
leaves the church with little to say in public on sex, a potent factor
in the make-up of human animals. In trying to redress this, Bishop
Holloway may not himself receive the tolerance he is seeking for those
who have behaved badly in letting their hormones rule their heads.
When the Bishop of Durham tried to say that the Resurrection was
something more than a conjuring trick with bones, he was misquoted and
in public perception is remembered as having said it was a conjuring
trick with bones. Time will tell whether Richard Holloway becomes the
bishop who said adultery was a conjuring trick by hormones.

ANYONE as outspoken as Richard Holloway will at some time end up
tripping over his own words, misquoted or not.
He is an outstanding communicator, author of a dozen books exploring a
variety of moral dilemmas and theological issues. As a broadcaster, he
presented When I Get to Heaven, a series of interviews where prominent
people outlined their vision of celestial happiness.
Nor has he ever been reluctant to take up his sword on social issues.
He was the leading force in setting up the Christian Housing
Association, later to become the West of Scotland Housing Association.
Three years ago he launched a savage attack on the Government's
housing policy. He said the removal of income support for 16 and
17-year-olds was a national scandal and compared increasing levels of
homelessness as an even greater affront to the nation's conscience than
''the assassination of the mining industry''.
The Rev John Harvey, leader of the Iona Community, a colleague from
their days together in the Gorbals, said: ''Richard is a very good
communicator and someone with a profound theological understanding and
wisdom. He has a knack of saying things which make you sit up and take
notice.
''He has written quite a lot about this subject and the whole basis of
Christianity and sexual behaviour. When he says something, it is worth
listening to,'' he said.
A fervent supporter of women in the priesthood, his eclectic theology
was developed during the course of a ministry which has taken him to
America and various charges in Scotland and England.
Yesterday he displayed a rare irritation with the media. He usually
has a good line in self-deprecating humour, one shared by his wife Jean,
daughter of a former dean of divinity at Harvard. They have three
children.
He was appointed Bishop of Edinburgh in 1986 and is primus of the
Scottish Episcopal Church. Earlier this year he was tipped as a
front-runner to succeed Dr John Hapgood as Archbishop of York, but at
61, his age might have counted against him.
He is an evangelical but without the self-importance and pomposity of
some Christian fundamentalists.
A tall, monkish figure, Richard Holloway represents the antithesis of
the ''all gas and gaiters'' type of Anglican bishop.
When one of his priests launched Edinburgh's first pub church at the
Theatre Royal Bar last year, the bishop came along to deliver the sermon
and enjoyed a pint with some of the newcomers afterwards.
''The church is meant to signal to the world this possibility of
change and transformation, but it has stopped doing that. The only thing
it signals to the world on noticeboards outside is 'keep away', leaving
people thinking it's not for them,'' he said then. ''We are bringing the
message of God's good news.''
The trouble is that getting the message across entails occasional
risk, as Bishop Holloway found out yesterday. The one saving grace is
that at least a long-neglected issue is now being widely debated, even
if not in the considered way he had intended.

Andrew Wilson examines the track record of the Scot with a
pharmaceuticals background who has been picked to head the amalgamated
nuclear industry
IF THE Government wants to kill two birds with one stone in the thorny
problem of selling the nuclear generating industry to both the public
and the City, it has selected one of the better missiles in the person
of John Robb.
He is the former chairman and chief executive of the Wellcome
pharmaceuticals giant best-known for its AZT-Retrovir anti-Aids drug
before it was taken over by competitor Glaxo earlier this year in
Britain's biggest takeover bid, worth #9000m.
Born in Edinburgh and educated until the age of 16 at the then Daniel
Stewart's College, his Scottish antecedents may take some, but not much,
of the fear that the nuclear industry will be dominated by the English
end, even if headquartered in Scotland, and that the effective decisions
will be taken south of the Border.
But the more significant task is selling the industry as an investment
and a store of considerable value. And here the Robb experience so far
is instructive.
Tall, slighty grizzled and usually affable and genial at first
meeting, it does not take long to discover there is a streak of unusual
hardness and impatience which is not always successfully contained.
Twice he has had the ground shot from under his feet when he was in a
position of considerable power. The first time was in 1988. Then he was
chief executive of the Beecham pharmaceuticals group, now merged with
SmithKline to form Smithkline Beecham on the basis that bigger is
better. He was fired after 22 years with the company, having risen
through the ranks to become chief executive.
The stated reason was that SB had decided to split the role of
chairman and chief executive and called in Bob Bauman, the
''million-dollar man'', as chairman. That was a lot of money in 1988. He
is now chairman of British Aerospace and one of the Americans, like
Richard Giordano of British Gas, who has attained supreme power in a
major British company.
Inevitably there was friction, and as Robb has said, it was cheaper
for him to go and ''it seemed right to pitch my tent elsewhere''.
The second defeat was that administered by Glaxo when the Wellcome
Trust, which owned 39.5% of Wellcome shares, promised its stake to the
bidder. It had no choice as far as the trustees were concerned as the
investment income realisable from the #2450m cash it is currently
receiving from Glaxo is worth considerably more than the dividends from
Wellcome.
The trust, which owned the company completely until its flotation in
1986, is now the biggest charitable foundation in the world, with assets
of #7000m or so, and last year paid the salaries of 3100 university
researchers in the medical field.
Robb travelled the world looking for a ''white knight'' or alternative
bidder but there were few heavyweights around with the cash resources to
take on Glaxo in a hostile takeover battle or thought sufficiently
highly of Wellcome, where the major money spinner is the Zovirax
herpes-control drug.
At least he left Wellcome a rich man. The combination of the
cancellation of his two-year rolling contract with a basic salary of
#475,000 and share options has meant that he has emerged from the defeat
clutching cheques worth about #2.2m as consolation.
He had joined Wellcome at the invitation of then chairman, Sir Alfred
''Shep'' Sheppard, an autocrat who had successfully built the company up
into a major force and had been astute enough to realise the need to
concentrate on virology as the particular area of specialisation.
When Sheppard stood down, he was succeded by Dalmuir-born nuclear
scientist and former chairman of RTZ the late Sir Alistair Frame. When,
to the regret of all, Frame retired due to ill-health, Robb, as chief
executive, took over the chairmanship and resolutely refused to split
the role as is demanded by the Cadbury Code on corporate governance.
So while there may be a feeling of insecurity because of the two
dismissals, it is impossible to discern.
Robb is primarily a salesman but with the ability to assimilate
technical knowledge, as has been seen with his career in pharmaceuticals
and particularly in the past four or five years at Wellcome where the
complexities of viral infections are beyond the comprehension of most
people.
Indeed, his career is based upon his never having had any doubts about
his own abilities. He has said that at the end of each of his tours of
duty with Beecham -- he spent much time in the Far East -- he would ask
himself were the companies in better shape than when he started with
them. ''I could always look in the mirror and say 'Yes'.''
There may be a concern he will not delegate. ''The future of the
company is in my hands. I wish I could do it all -- but it is too
complex.''
After National Service in Austria and Cyrus, he joined Heinz for seven
years and then Eskimo Frozen foods in Grimsby, where he met his wife who
was working for the Inland Revenue. His career at Beecham was concerned
with selling McLean's Toothpaste. Nuclear may not be packaged and
branded so easily.
His career is based upon his never having had any doubts about his own
abilities

Political Editor Geoffrey Parkhouse examines the role of the lobbyist
and the lure of lucrative consultancies to MPs
THE Wiggin case will add urgency to the Commons debate today on the
report of the Nolan Committee's recommendations to improve the standard
of public life. We're not talking about cash-for-questions this time,
but a former minister with a specific personal interest who tried to
plant amendments to a Bill in its committee stage.
For centuries Parliament has been used by lobbyists to prosecute their
interests, financial and otherwise. Indeed the 900-year-old Westminster
Hall for a long time was the place you went to buy a lawyer, to buy
influence, and a place on the ladder for legislation. But in those days
parliamentarians were place men, many of them bought before they got
there.
Now, MPs are elected on a universal franchise and the public requires
them to do their parliamentary duties without reward beyond their
#33,000 salary. For the past 40 years there have been guidelines but
broadly speaking the nation relied on an individual MP's sense of
honour.
No longer is this the case. The line between what is right and wrong
has been fudged as the number of firms created specifically for their
lobbyist expertise and contacts has increased.
The majority of these activities are translucent and serve a
respectable purpose. For example the most celebrated of these lobbyist
firms, Ian Greer Associates, co-ordinated the fight to persuade the
state of California not to impose double taxation on British firms
operating there.
Tony Blair, now the leader of the Labour Party, was among other MPs
who were taken to the United States by Concorde to assist in the fight,
in which the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the then
President Ronald Reagan, formerly the governor of California, were
personally engaged.
Other MPs declared this Concorde journey on the register of Members'
Interests, but Blair did not, either because he didn't think it
necessary or because he didn't think it important. Is Blair to be
traduced for this? Ian Greer Associates organised the trip, as they
organised other collaborations with other MPs.
Sir Jerry Wiggin, former Defence and Agriculture Minister, has a
personal interest as a paid adviser to the British Holiday and Home
Parks Association. Apparently he was not on the standing committee of
the Gas Privatisation Bill and therefore could not table amendments in
his own name. So he tabled them in the name of fellow Tory MP Sebastian
Coe, the former Olympic champion.
His mistake was not to inform Coe of what he was doing. The Speaker
said yesterday that she will consider urgently whether this should be
referred to the Privileges Committee. The normal form is for an MP who
wants to use a colleague who is a member of a standing committee is to
approach that colleague, explain his interest and why he wants an
amendment tabled. The Bill committee member then decides whether it is a
valid proposition.
This case is in a different plain from the activities of the growing
band of some 30 specialist firms who are paid by outside interests --
mainly commercial companies and big business to cultivate Members of
Parliament in the Lords and Commons on behalf of their clients. It is
now estimated to be an industry worth more than #30m per year.
Clients are charged up to #5000 a month for consultants' fees and
political intelligence. For this they keep an eye on what is happening
in Parliament, the progress of legislation, and they lay on lunches and
dinners aimed at providing an opportunity for the clients to meet
ministers and back benchers.
Big organisations like British Gas, Thomas Cook and TSB find these
activities useful and it is understandable that companies want to know
if their names are being mentioned in the Chambers or in the lobbies.
MPs who take paid positions in these enterprises are obliged to
register them annually in the List of Members' Interests. Recently MPs
such as Jonathan Aitken, now Chief Secretary at the Treasury, and Neil
Hamilton have found themselves under scrutiny for failure to clarify how
their bills at the Ritz Hotel in Paris were paid for, precisely.
The threat of exposure has already sharpened MPs' awareness of the
dangers of not declaring interests in minute detail. The long-standing
rule that MPs speaking in the Chamber of the Commons on any subject must
declare a personal interest in their speech still stands. Today MPs are
debating the Nolan recommendations which cover the whole field of
parliamentary activity.
Two key recommendations are: ''The House of Commons should restate the
1947 resolution which places an absolute bar on members entering into
contracts or agreements which in any way restrict their freedom to act
and speak as they wish, or which require them to act in Parliament as
representatives of outside bodies.''
Nolan further states: ''The House should prohibit members from
entering into any agreements in connection with their role as
parliamentarians, to undertake services for or on behalf of
organisations which provide paid parliamentary services to multiple
clients or from maintaining any direct or active connections with firms,
or parts of larger firms, which provide such parliamentary services.''
Urgency is now the thing. A Gallup survey for the Daily Telegraph
recently indicated that no less than 64% of the public believe that MPs
make a lot of money by using public office improperly. It is argued that
the majority of MPs do no such thing but the pressure of commerce, and
the ability of British companies to compete and profit is such in the
1990s that shortcuts can be taken, honourable or otherwise.
Nolan states that MPs should remain free to have paid employment
unrelated to their role as MPs. But it is still to be left to the
Commons itself to decide whether individuals should be permitted to
receive #10,000 ''consultancies'' which they would not have had they not
been elected to Parliament.
In politics these days communications and communication skills are
all. Every minister and shadow minister has to be trained for their TV
soundbites. Arguably captains of industry, obliged more and more to
appear on the instant on television require to be informed of the
intimate goings-on in Parliament.
It is not a matter for the Prime Minister or his Government to handle.
Major insisted again yesterday that he requires all his colleagues to
maintain the highest standards. It is for the Commons itself to decide
how it can reinstate itself in public esteem after a series of
controversial cases.

BRUCE McKAIN
Law Correspondent
A JUDGE yesterday agreed that court officers could search for a
14-month-old girl at the centre of an international custody dispute so
that she can go back to Spain for her future to be decided.
The child's father, Mr Jose Cortes, claims his estranged wife, Ms
Catherine Johnston, 25, removed their child, Lucia, from Spain
illegally.
The couple were married in Spain in 1992 but Mr Cortes claims that,
last December, his wife left the family home without warning, taking
Lucia to Scotland.
The UK and Spain are both signatories of the Hague Convention on
International Child Abduction, which was designed to discourage parents
in cross-border custody disputes from taking the law into their own
hands.
It states that children who have been removed illegally from their
country of residence must be returned to that country as soon as
possible, so that disputes over access and custody can be thrashed out
there.
The court will take this step unless it can be satisfied that the
return would place the child or the parent in physical or psychological
danger.
At the Court of Session last month, Lord Clyde declared that the
removal and retention of Lucia Cortes from Spain was unlawful and that
Ms Johnston must take her daughter back.
The deadline for making the travel arrangements ran out yesterday and
Lord Cullen was told at the Court of Session that Ms Johnston had failed
to make any plans to fly to Spain.
Miss Nikki Stewart, counsel for Jose Cortes, told the court her client
wanted the dispute settled amicably. Unfortunately, the estranged wife
had attracted media attention, and threatened to hide the child and to
refuse to comply with the court order.
In those circumstances, Mr Cortes had come to court reluctantly to
seek an order for messengers-at-arms to search for Lucia and deliver the
girl to her father.
Mr Des Browne, appearing for Ms Johnston, conceded that some things
had been said by her which should not have been aired in public.
He also told the court that, on Monday, legal aid had been made
available to pay for a flight to Spain for Ms Johnston and Lucia and she
had been given appropriate legal advice about her duties and
obligations.
''But she is a woman who is apparently confused and is frightened for
her own safety and the safety of her child,'' said Mr Browne.
It was hoped that interim custody proceedings would begin soon in
Spain.
The court was also told that if Ms Johnston took Lucia back, Mr Cortes
was willing to pay for accommodation for both of them in Benidorm.
Lord Cullen said: ''Naturally, any court would be reluctant to make an
order in the terms of warrant sought if there was an alternative.
''But I have to look at the matter in the framework of the Hague
Convention, which requires the court of this country to attend properly
to any undischarged obligation to return the child who has been removed
or retained wrongfully.
''In this situation, it is quite clear for the time being that she is
not willing voluntarily to go back with the child to Spain. She has
given no undertaking to do so.
''The best that can be said is she might do so if certain steps have
been taken in Spain.
''I regret I don't regard that as sufficient reason for not proceeding
to grant the warrant which is sought. In the circumstances, I am left
with no reasonable alternative but to grant the warrant.''
If Ms Johnston does not return voluntarily to Spain with Lucia, court
officers will collect Lucia and it is understood that her father will
fly to Scotland to take her back to Spain.
The Court of Session decision was condemned by Mr Tom Clarke, Labour
MP for Monklands West, who immediately called upon Scottish Office
Ministers to intervene.
''I find this decision deeply distressing and difficult to
understand,'' he said. ''I am expecting replies to my priority written
question to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang and will be asking to meet him
urgently.
''Ms Johnston is continuing to take legal advice and it is hoped that
immediate action by her lawyers in Spain can secure her interim custody
of her child.''
Mr Clarke said this was bound to be an expensive process.
He added: ''I have applied for an adjournment debate so that the
issues surrounding this case can be raised more fully on the floor of
the House.''

JUDGES and journalists joined to pay tribute yesterday to Mr George
Saunders, chief law correspondent of the Scotsman for 25 years, who died
yesterday. He was 71.
During a career which began with the Stirling Sentinel in 1939, Mr
Saunders covered most of Scotland's most important and most sensational
cases.
These included the Garvie murder trial, the Biggar murder, the
scandalous Duchess of Argyll divorce, and the Poulson and Pottinger
corruption trial in Leeds.
He was also heavily involved for many years with the National Council
for the Training of Journalists, teaching colleagues in the media how to
tread safely through the minefield of law reporting.
He was awarded the MBE in the Birthday Honours List in 1988, the year
in which he retired.
Lord MacLean, the High Court and Court of Session judge, said
yesterday he had always found Mr Saunders ''thoughtful, helpful, and
agreeable.
''I think the court always found his reports captured the essence of
the case.''
Mr George Watt, former Court of Session Correspondent for The Herald,
who worked with Mr Saunders for 25 years, said: ''George Saunders had
many enviable qualities as a journalist, chief of which was probably a
remarkable memory.''
Mr Watt referred to Casebook of the Bizarre, the book of famous cases
Mr Saunders published after his retirement and a comment which he felt
summed up his former colleague.
''Ross Harper, the eminent Scottish lawyer, said of him on that
occasion: 'George Saunders was always accurate, incisive, and, above
all, completely trustworthy, friendly, and gregarious'.''
Mr Saunders, who died of a stroke, is survived by his wife, Margaret,
and a daughter and a son.

A FAMILY yesterday relived the moments when a trail of flame roared
after their car before it exploded, giving them only seconds to escape.
Their escape was all the more fortunate, because the eight-year-old
son of Mr Robert Hardie and his wife, Kate, was asleep in the back and
had to be pulled from the car after being caught in his seat belt.
The incident happened in Blackburn, West Lothian, as Mr Hardie, a
42-year-old electrician, was driving to his home at Garden City, Bents,
near Stoneyburn, on Monday evening. Earlier, the couple had collected
their son, Jamie, from his grandparents' home nearby.
Mr Hardie bought the 1986-model Maestro as a birthday present for his
31-year-old wife last February.
Examining the charred wreck of the #1200 gift, he said: ''We are lucky
to be alive, there is no doubt about it.
''I was driving along the road, when I heard a bang, looked in the
mirror, and saw spilled petrol ablaze and heading for the back of the
car.
''It appears that the fuel tank was ruptured, by what I don't know,
spilling fuel on to the hot exhaust pipe.''
Mr Hardie said flames and smoke reached the interior, as they
struggled to release their son.
He added: ''We only had time to run to the other side of the road
before the car exploded.''
Yesterday, the family was still shocked by their experience.''
Mrs Hardie said: ''I do not know what would have happened had I been
on my own with Jamie. He is a big boy for his age and we both had a
struggle to get him out of the car.''
A spokesman for Lothian and Borders police said the incident was still
under investigation.

SCOTLAND's three major government-funded musical organisations are to
form a working group with a view to investigating collaborative
ventures.
For the first time, Scottish Opera, the Royal Scottish National
Orchestra, and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra will hold a series of
meetings to discuss ways of maximising their potential in a climate of
financial standstill. The meetings will be held over the summer and the
group will complete a report by September.
The working group will meet under the chairmanship of Sir Lewis
Robertson, chairman of Postern Ltd (corporate recovery services) and a
former chairman of the Scottish Arts Council.
The arts council, which suggested the three flagship organisations get
together, said yesterday it had been told by the Scottish Office to plan
for 1996/97 on the basis of not receiving any additional funding.
Between them, the three organisations receive more than #7m, which is
over 90% of the entire budget for provision of music in Scotland, and
around 30% of the total revenue budget for the arts.
All three organisations, and the Scottish Arts Council, yesterday
denied there was a hidden agenda to the formation of a working group.
They also denied that it represented an attempt to solve the so-called
problem of the Scottish Opera Orchestra by disbanding it while the Royal
SNO and the SCO sit conveniently in the wings, waiting to fill the gap.
An earlier attempt to address the alleged over-provision of orchestras
in Scotland, and underuse of the Scottish Opera Orchestra, by a proposal
to merge it with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, remains -- two and
a half years on -- unresolved.
Mr Richard Jarman, general director of Scottish Opera, yesterday
strenuously denied that a collaboration with the Royal SNO and the SCO
represented an alternative solution to Scottish Opera, and a means of
disposing of the Scottish Opera Orchestra. ''There is no one solution
but having an orchestra that is dedicated to playing opera is a
fundamental part of running an opera company.''
None of the organisations was prepared to suggest what might come out
of the meetings of the group. Collaborations between a number of
organisations -- including the Royal SNO and the SCO, which last week
announced a joint festival of American Music -- are already taking place
in the Scottish music scene.
In the current climate of limited and shrinking revenue funding,
however, it seems likely that more basic issues, such as the question of
overall resources, and the structure of the orchestral scene itself,
will be addressed.

THE late Geoffrey Dickens gave one of the most notable news
conferences even in the chequered history of such events at Westminster.
Journalists who had been summoned in March 1981 to hear about a further
stage in his worthy campaign against paedophiles were stunned when he
went on to introduce the attractive woman sitting beside him as his
mistress for whom he had left his wife.
Their meeting had taken place at a dansant which Mr Dickens frequented
as a keen dancer and as relaxation from his parliamentary duties.
Spicier details of the vast MP sharing a narrow single bed with another
woman who befriended him kept the media happily employed until his
long-suffering wife reclaimed him.
This spectacular incident and his nearly 20st frame and cheery,
rubicund face, together with a foghorn voice made him an instant Commons
character. With his earlier exploits in mind, he nearly brought the
House down by declaring during exchanges about rape: ''I can do every
woman in this country a favour.''
One of that all-party band of MPs available for instant quotes on
often ephemeral topics, he was generally recognised as more interested
in promoting what he believed in than himself. His down-to-earth style
was popular both in his constituency and farther afield.
Though he had wide support for his campaign against paedophiles (which
saw the wind-up of the Paedophile Information Exchange) some felt he
went too far in using parliamentary privilege to name a doctor accused
but later cleared of raping an eight-year-old -- and roaring ''castrate
the buggers'' at the 1991 Tory Party conference. Few doubted, however,
that his heart was in the right place.
He often voiced Conservative grassroots frustrations with outbursts
that less restrained Members avoided, suggesting after the Birmingham
Six were freed that the IRA should now provide the names of the real
perpetrators of the bomb attack, and tilting at the European Commission
which at one point he accused of wanting to prevent him eating
marmalade-flavoured crisps.
He took the view that the Princess of Wales could not become Queen and
not only denounced VAT on domestic fuel as unfair and unjust but was one
of the three Tory MPs to vote against it.
He came from a family with many miners in its ranks and was fostered
for eight years when his parents split up. His two sons follow
appropriately colourful careers, Clive being a motor cycle scrambler as
well as a head waiter and Barry a showjumper.
Geoffrey Dickens started on the shop floor and moved up to be a design
draughtsman, training manager, and sales manager. He was a boxer in the
RAF, and fought future British heavyweight champion Henry Cooper. He
also saved children from drowning in the Mediterranean. He qualified as
one of the few genuine characters in a House of Commons in which they
are in short supply.
Mr Dickens died of cancer with his family around him.

BY any objective measurement, Leslie Sharp's tenure of office as Chief
Constable of Strathclyde has been an outstanding success.
Had he chosen to go on, to remain in his post into his 60s as he was
entitled to do, his new employers -- a joint board made up from the 12
new unitary authorities -- might well have found themselves paying him
between #90,000 and #100,000 in performance-related pay and bonuses.
With crime falling as his special operations and the new concentration
on intelligence-led policing bites into criminal cultures, Mr Sharp's
force would certainly have met the Government-prescribed performance
indicators set for them and he would have benefited handsomely.
However, as another senior police source put it yesterday, top
policemen like Leslie Sharp are not there because of the money. They do
the job because they believe first of all in the public service ethos
and they believe that the police should by definition be part of that.
When a man like Leslie Sharp decides he can no longer in all conscience
carry on, then sensible politicians should sit up and take note.
He is not, of course, the first casualty of the Home Secretary's pure
market dogma. Hampshire's chief constable, Mr John Hoddinott, a
committed officer elected president of the Association of Chief Police
Officers in England by his fellows, has already announced that he will
not accept a fixed-term contract. It is against his principles, he says,
although he too stood to benefit from appraisal-related pay, and he was
backed by the superintendents' associations both in England and here.
In fact, Jack Urquhart, secretary of the Scottish Superintendents'
Association, articulated many of the fears associated with these
fixed-term appointments when he said young officers of high calibre
would think twice about taking them up when they could be left short of
pensionable service. And would interviews be objective when a chief
officer reapplied for his own job if it were advertised?
When Mr Hoddinott made his stand earlier this month, one member of the
House of Lords suggested the Government's policy had received a serious
setback, only to be dismissed by Baroness Blatch, the Home Office
Minister, with the line that he had made a personal choice and many
other chief officers would undoubtedly choose to participate. Many will,
but other chief officers on both sides of the Border are known to be
wavering at this very moment about whether to take part in the latest
game and, should they decide not to, the prospect arises of an exodus of
experience, talent, and dedication from the very highest levels of the
police force which the country can ill afford. Leslie Sharp's decision
should be viewed in that light.
While he could not discuss publicly his personal reasons for retiral,
Mr Sharp's confidants and senior colleagues have little doubt that he is
a man who has had enough. Not enough of the policing itself but enough
of the politics surrounding it.
It was a significant achievement to have brought Strathclyde Police up
to authorised establishment for the first time in its history, pinning
down the Labourites of Strathclyde region to back their public avowals
on law and order with real cash resources. It seems to have been no
coincidence that when the police numbers at the sharp end -- the result
of a determined civilianisation programme as well as recruitment -- rose
to realistic levels then the force began making inroads into recorded
crime.
Having announced that he intended to use his overtime budget for
hiring another 250 officers to bring the establishment up to 1995 demand
levels as opposed to 1975 approved establishment level, Mr Sharp faced
the prospect of seeing the plan scuppered should the Scottish Office bow
to Treasury demands to have Strathclyde region's budget capped in its
final year.
There are, of course, other strands to be taken into account. He was
out of step with his fellow senior officers in the Association of Chief
Police Officers of Scotland on some important issues, notably in his
repeatedly stated belief that eventually Scotland would have to have a
single police force to achieve economies of scale and build the
infrastructure necessary to fight international and cross-border crime.
No-one else agreed with him, pointing to the loss of community closeness
which is demonstrably vital to successful crime fighting.
He was due to take up the presidency of the association in a month or
two, which could have been a bed of nails. It would also have been daft
to have assumed the office then quit some months into it. He had already
turned it down on a previous occasion.
The real key to his decision to jump ship lies in last night's speech,
and the Government ignores the clear signals at its peril. Hard on the
heels of the Sheehy Inquiry, which was an enormous trauma for the entire
police force and which led to hitherto-unexperienced levels of
bitterness and polarisation, has come a whole raft of market-inspired
dogma. The Government has simply refused to listen to the collective
voice of the police, insisting instead that policing is a business like
any other and will respond to market and business practices.
He expressed concern about the market testing of police functions to
find out who else could do them more cheaply -- it did nothing to
enhance the idea of a public police service. The small-change routine of
ancillary tasks, whether they can be measured or not, draws the police
and the public closer together, he said.
The tenor of the whole lecture spoke of a police chief seriously out
of step with current political thinking; of a level of disillusionment
and even a sense of betrayal. That would be understandable in view of Mr
Sharp's leadership achievements but there is little doubt that his words
are merely an eloquent reflection of the wider sense of frustration and
betrayal felt by the police service as a whole.

This extract is taken from the lecture given by Strathclyde Chief
Constable Leslie Sharp in the Town and Gown series of lectures at
Strathclyde University last night. The series is sponsored by The
Herald.
IT is the financial pressure upon the service which is changing the
context in which policing operates. That pressure could signal the end
of the beat bobby as we know him, or her.
Take, for example, the current proposals that basic police patrol
tasks could be undertaken by private security, or by a lower grade
officer, with minimal police powers. Their role would be to patrol the
streets in uniform so as to satisfy the unquenchable thirst of the
public for more police on the streets -- public reassurance, policing on
the cheap.
The proponents for this new two-tier policing argue that there is only
a tenuous link between the numbers of police on the beat, and the amount
of crime committed.
In 1984 Home Office researchers claimed that a police officer on foot
patrol would come within 100 yards of a criminal in action only once
every eight years. American research suggested that a foot-patrol
officer would come across a street robbery only once in 14 years.
I have even seen research which suggests that a patrolling police
officer will only stumble across a crime once every 40 years.
Therefore, it has been argued, the beat officer could be employed on
more productive work, leaving the streets to the lesser mortals.
It is my contention that these so-called findings are based upon
dubious research and statistics. I am surprised that such doubtful
research should have gained such credence as it has.
I have no doubts that the public would rather have a fully trained
police officer on the street than a security officer, or some kind of
second-tier officer.
The private security industry is to a large extent unregulated and
there is nothing to prevent someone coming out of prison and setting
themselves up as a security company.
A local authority in Northumbria is modernising a housing estate which
had a history of violence and crime. During the work there has been very
little pilfering or vandalism. It was suggested that this was because
people in the area were too frightened to steal or commit damage. What
where they frightened of?
The rumour was that the estate's developers were paying some notorious
individuals to keep the peace. Those so-called guards were known to have
histories of violent behaviour, even with weapons, and newspapers
reported that they did not even need to patrol the site, fear of
reprisal was enough.
A local councillor is reported to have said: ''With sites like this,
if you don't pay someone to protect it, then things tend to get
vandalised. What is happening seems to suit most people because it cuts
down on vandalism and damage, but it is wrong. People with criminal
records should not be allowed to do this kind of work.''
The whole face of policing could change dramatically as the Government
strives to make police forces more like private businesses. Ever
increasingly, chief constables are devising ingenious ways to save
money. The Home Office has just completed a review of police activities
and will publish the results in the near future.
The principal aim of the, Review of Police Core and Ancillary Tasks,
is to identify police functions that could be carried out by some other
organisation, such as local authorities or private companies. It is
likely that the report will recommend a fundamental shift in the way
police operate, with a greater role for the private security industry.
In England already there are signs that private police forces are
being established. In the North-east a council has established its own
security force because it was dissatisfied with the cover provided by
Durham constabulary.
A London borough planned to go even further, by setting up its own
council police force. It has been persuaded not to pursue this idea and
it seems likely that the London borough will instead give money to the
Metropolitan Police to pay for increased police patrolling in its area.
This idea of public bodies and even private firms entering sponsorship
schemes that would allow them to buy the exclusive services of police is
abhorrent to me.
There are ethical issues which outweigh the short-term advantages. On
May 1 this year, in Northamptonshire, four community constables took to
the streets ''sponsored'' by a local council at a cost of #110,000 a
year.
The money will not come from the council charge, but from the profits
made by a regular Sunday market. The arrangement will have to be
approved by the council annually. Whoever pays the piper calls the tune,
so the money is conditional on the four officers patrolling small and
specific beat areas.
To me, it is quite wrong for the level of policing to be determined by
the ability of those receiving the service to pay for it. Chief
constables anxious to tap sponsorship resources will explain that they
will not reduce cover in other areas to compensate for officers deployed
in shopping precincts or on housing estates, hospitals or universities,
but the danger is they will have contracted to provide specific levels
of cover -- a contractual obligation which has to be met.
Would police forces accept sponsors money from all businesses?
Woolworths seems OK! But what about a brewery? Would the police force
sponsored by Timex feel free to police an industrial dispute at the
Timex factory in the traditional way?
There has always been a role for properly constituted, private-hire
firms in protecting property, but there are questions to answer if it
becomes the norm for security firms to be involved with public
activities and with the behaviour of individuals. I have no doubts that
there is only room for one police force in an area.
Legitimate security firms, like Group 4, have been pushing for proper
regulation of the private security industry for more than a decade --
licensing and training standards -- but some recent moves towards
so-called private riot squads are more than interesting.
It has been reported that Group 4 is forming tactical units ready to
be placed at airports and other places, including the detention centre
privately run by Group 4, which houses immigrants seeking political
asylum. It seems that these units will be trained in control and
restraint techniques to deal with disorder, and to escort the movements,
deportations and removals of illegal immigrants. This particular
detention centre was the subject of a serious riot in June 1994, which
took 150 police officers four hours to quell. I hope Group 4 can do
better!
Of course, there are many tasks which the police service will not be
sorry to lose -- escorting the abnormal loads on motorways and dual
carriageways, the handling of stray dogs, noise pollution enforcement,
licensing of some routine activities, and the serving of summonses on
defendants and witnesses, but we await with interest to see whether the
report recognises that police involvement in many ancillary service
tasks is vitally important to the maintenance of the trust,
understanding and co-operation of the public, upon which we depend for
crime prevention and criminal detection.
The increase in the numbers of private security guards and public
patrols has been predicted to be the most visible change in the way the
streets are policed. Already the private-security industry employs well
over 160,000 -- they outnumber the uniformed police service.
I have nothing but admiration for the voluntary anti-crime schemes
such as Neighbourhood Watch, but it seems that such schemes are likely
to change to something called ''Street Watch''. Members of the public in
Street Watch schemes will undertake street patrols, which have a
potential for irresponsibility very close to vigilantes. The Home
Secretary described them not as patrols but merely people ''walking with
a purpose.''
A Home Office report, called, Policing and Neighbourhood Watch, was
published last week. It recommends a three-tier system. In low-crime
areas the schemes should be organised and run by community volunteers.
In medium crime areas, active police involvement with the volunteers was
required, but in the high crime areas there were particular problems of
intimidation. Therefore, the report concludes, Neighbourhood Watch
should be given a new name, and organisations other than the police
should take the lead in setting up and financing such schemes.
People living in middle-class areas, with high-income earners should
be willing to pay for what is referred to as ''passive police support'',
but in the poorer areas fund-raising events, subscriptions, and private
sponsorship should be encouraged to pay for the Neighbourhood Watch.
Whilst it is true that these far reaching changes will enable police
resources to go elsewhere, I doubt that they will encourage more schemes
on the poorer housing estates. For the report to say, as it does, that:
''There is a real danger that without change more and more police will
come to perceive Neighbourhood Watch as a millstone, requiring support
merely to keep a smallish but articulate subsection of the population
happy,'' misses the point of Neighbourhood Watch.
Neighbourhood Watch schemes were set up for public-spirited volunteers
to be the eyes and ears of the police, and while the members of such
schemes learn to keep their eyes and ears open when, for example, they
are walking their dog, or travelling to work, they should not be
expected to formally patrol the streets, which is potentially dangerous
work for which the volunteers are untrained and unaccountable, nor
should they be expected to raise funds, or seek sponsorship.
If any of theses changes come about, they come hard on the heels of
other reforms introduced by the Police and Magistrates Courts Act, 1994,
which provides that after April 1, 1995, future chief constables and
assistant-chief constables will be given contracts, called fixed term
agreements, for between four and ten years.
They will then receive annual bonuses of up to 7.5% of their pay.
Those bonuses will be dependant upon their performance against personal
objectives set for them by the Police Authority, which after April 1,
1996, will be a joint board comprised of the 12 new unitary authorities.
Although such practices are commonplace in the business world, for the
police service they are a radical departure which could weaken the
much-valued and traditional independence of chief constables from
political control or influence. Chief officers of police often have to
take controversial decisions, for example, the arming of a police force,
or part of it; or policing the demonstrations against the M77
construction, or the many marches and processions which pass through
Strathclyde every year.
There is a real danger that such decisions will be seen as being
influenced by performance-pay awards or by negotiations for a new
contract. I do not believe that to be a healthy state of affairs.
I am concerned about the market testing of police functions to find
out if anyone can do them more cheaply. To me such a practice does
nothing to enhance the idea of a public police service. Ancillary tasks,
whether they can be measured or not, draw the police and public closer
together.
The police require the support of the people, and the people require
the support of the police. That support will not be forthcoming if the
service provided is not to the public's liking.
The public want more police officers on the beat and better
communication between the police and communities. The police want to be
accountable to the public -- not through rather crude performance
indicators imposed upon us, not only indirectly through the law -- but
directly answerable by more informal means.
Accountability should be a means of maintaining integrity, a
collective purpose, and a responsibility to those using the service.
Performance indicators, fixed-term appointments, performance related
pay, the concentration on core tasks, will not even come near to
achieving that.
A useful source of street wisdom is the taxi driver. When riding in
taxis I have never heard a Glasgow taxi driver say: ''You know Guv',
what these criminals want is a good dose of local government reform;
performance related pay for the police; more people walking with a
purpose; and more private security guards.'' They have often advised me,
''You know Guv', what the people want is more police on the beat.''
Will someone, somewhere, please ''spare a copper.''

A FARMER was warned yesterday that he could be jailed or banned from
keeping livestock after being found guilty of causing unnecessary
suffering, neglect, and distress to cattle.
Sheriff Charles Stoddart deferred sentence at Paisley Sheriff Court
and called for background reports on John Harper, 53, of Barrodger Farm,
Lochwinnoch, in Renfrewshire.
Harper, who was found guilty of six charges relating to the poor
condition of livestock in his dairy herd, and pled guilty to a seventh,
was warned by the sheriff that the offences were serious breaches,
particularly as in one instance a threat had been posed to public health
through his failure to dispose of carcasses.
These were found lying in a rat-infested pit by police, vets, and
animal cruelty inspectors who raided the farm a year ago.
Harper was convicted of failing to provide adequate care and expert
veterinary attention to two fresian cows and a bullock. Each of the
animals had to be destroyed as they were in such a poor condition.
Other cattle were lame and suffering from muscle wastage, while some
could barely walk due to untrimmed hooves.
During the trial, depute fiscal Mrs Margo Addison-Scott, said post-
mortem examinations had been carried out on two of the animals an they
were found to be suffering from salmonella infection.
She added that one of the animals, subsequently destroyed, was in such
a poor state, vets had left instructions it be segregated from the rest
of the herd and not be moved while it was given attention over a number
of days.
Instead, she said, Harper had taken it upon himself to remove the
animal and abandon it in a field some distance away from the farm where
it was ''left to die''. Its identification tag had been cut from its
ear.
Another animal which had to be humanely destroyed had a leg wound
which made it lame and was suffering from septic arthritis. The bullock
displayed serious hair loss due to ringworm, lice, and mange.
Sheriff Stoddart said it was obvious from video film and photographs
shown to the court that the animals singled out in three of the charges
had suffered from neglect and that, despite their pain and distress,
Harper had not sought expert care.
Harper was also found guilty of causing unnecessary distress to an
unspecified number of animals on his farm.
The sheriff said he regarded the charges as serious neglect cases and
noted that imprisonment and disqualification from keeping cattle was a
possible disposal. He told the accused: ''In order to consider whether
these might be appropriate, I will defer sentence until June 7 and call
for background reports.''

A SHERIFF is involved in a legal battle with her late husband's
executors over the sale of their former home.
Miss Susan Raeburn QC, who has already received #40,000 for her half
share of the house, insists that she is now entitled to part of the
proceeds of any sale.
The executors say she has waived any right to the property which is in
an affluent part of Edinburgh and was valued at #80,000 in 1984.
They are asking the Court of Session to declare they are the owners of
the house at Braid Avenue and that Miss Raeburn, of Ramsay Garden, also
Edinburgh, has no right, title or interest in it.
Miss Raeburn, who sits as a sheriff in Strathclyde, and Edinburgh
solicitor James Gardner were married in March 1983 and in January of the
following year bought a house in Braid Avenue for #80,000. The house was
conveyed to the couple ''equally between them and to the survivor of
them''.
They separated in November 1985 and were divorced in September 1986.
As part of the financial agreement, it was arranged that Mr Gardner
would pay Miss Raeburn #51,500, including #40,000 to acquire her share
of the family home.
By a disposition registered in February 1986, Miss Raeburn, in return
for the #40,000 paid by her husband, made over to him and his executors
her whole right, title, and interest, present and future, in the family
home.
The executors argue that this conveyed not only her half share in the
home but also her whole right title and interest, present and future, in
her husband's half share.
They claim that by granting the disposition in 1986, Miss Raeburn
waived any rights she may have had in her late husband's half share.
The executors now wish to sell the house but say that Miss Raeburn has
refused to agree to the sale, contending that she is entitled to a share
in the proceeds because of the survivorship clause in the 1984 deed.
She says she was informed by a letter from the executors' solicitors
in 1993 that by virtue of the survivorship provision she had obtained
title to her late husband's one half share of the house.
Lord Cullen heard legal debate in the case at the Court of Session
yesterday and will give a decision in writing later.

SOME surgery patients at Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children
will have an extra week or two to wait for their operations because of
the temporary closure of a ward, the Yorkhill NHS Trust said yesterday.
Ward 5a at the hospital is the latest victim of the shortage of junior
doctors that has arisen because of the reduction in their working hours.
The Yorkhill management were unable to fill two of their 12 surgical
senior house officer posts at the beginning of the current six-monthly
rotation in February, and the effect has now caught up.
The ward normally closes for four to six weeks over the summer, when
the programme is slacker, because of staff and patients' holidays, but
this year it closed last weekend and will not open for three months,
when the next rotation of SHOs move in.
About 100 operations in ear, nose, and throat, opthalmology, and
general paediatric surgery will be affected but a spokesman said: ''It
will not affect emergency care. It will mean a slight increase in
waiting times, which are three months at the most and all within the
permitted maximum.
''The problem has affected many hospitals. We have searched nationally
and internationally but there was no-one available.''
The trust's chief executive, Mr Gerry Marr, said: ''The problem has
absolutely nothing to do with money. These posts are fully funded.
''We are disappointed at losing what amounts to three percent of our
surgical activity but it does not breach the guarantees we have given to
our purchasers and we will be trying to recover the ground in the
winter.
''This has to be seen in the context of a 29% increase in day-case
activity, 21% in out-patient, and 9% in in-patients. Our waiting lists
have never been shorter.
''The situation has arisen because there are many more SHO posts than
doctors to fill them, because of the redcuction in working hours. It has
been a surprise to us to be in this position -- we have not had
recruitment problems in the past and our autumn rota looks fine. We are
hoping this is just a blip.
''We were canvassing these posts well before Christmas, and we have
looked at temporary staff grades for locum cover, but without success.
We have been in touch with every agency.''
Although a number of hospitals were hit by shortages in February, it
is more surprising for a big-city teaching hospital such as Yorkhill to
find itself in this situation.
''Surgical paediatrics is often an attractive rotation, especially for
those going to general practice training -- they get exposure to a lot
of childhood conditions. One of the recruits for the August rotation is
from South Africa.
''Salaries don't come into it -- no-one is paying more than us, and
the hours and conditions are fixed by national agreement.
''If I were an SHO picking and choosing, I would be looking at the
quality of education and training and how it fitted in with my
longer-term career plan.
''They are under supervision in everything they do and, apart from
training in theatre, their duties are very much ward-based -- looking
after the patients before and after surgery, doing the paperwork. It is
the loss of this support, rather than in the theatre, that is the
problem.''

THE Ministry of Defence has urged High Court judges not to intervene
in the controversy over the ban on homosexuals serving in Britain's
armed forces -- but to wait for Parliament to take a fresh look at the
matter.
Mr Stephen Richards, for the MoD, said yesterday that the issue had
been reviewed periodically by the ad hoc House of Commons select
committee on the Armed Forces Bill, and he had no doubt it would be
looked at again in the 1995-96 parliamentary session.
There was an Armed Forces Act due in 1996.
Until now, it had been the judgment of the military authorities that
homosexuals could be ''disruptive'' and affect the efficiency of the
fighting services.
It was a judgment which might change -- but that was a matter for the
military and politicians and not for the courts, he said.
''It would be a very big step for the courts to brand as irrational
and unlawful a policy that has been subject to express consideration by
Parliament,'' said Mr Richards.
The ban had been upheld by a previous select committee review in 1991,
on the basis of experience in the armed forces that homosexual relations
were ''very disruptive'', partly because of the nature of service life
and ''the greater closeness in which people live and the greater lack of
privacy''.
Mr Richards was speaking on the third day of a landmark test case in
which three sacked servicemen and one woman are asking Lord Justice
Simon Brown and Mr Justice Curtis to rule the automatic bar ''perverse
and irrational'' and in breach of both European and domestic law.
Former Lieutenant Commander Duncan Lustig-Prean, 36, from London, the
most senior of the four, was dismissed as ''unsuitable'' last year, only
months after being commended by his commanding officer.
The other three are former RAF Sergeant Graeme Grady, 32, from London;
former RAF nurse Jeanette Smith, 28, from Edinburgh; and former Royal
Navy weapons engineer John Beckett, 25, from Sheffield.
They all want Britain to lift the ban so they can resume their
careers, which were highly successful until their dismissals.
Mr Richards rejected accusations that the MoD's ban on homosexuals was
''pandering to irrational prejudices and intolerance''.
He said: ''That is plainly not the case. You cannot ignore the
sensitivities of people in the matter of sexual orientation.''
Military personnel had to live and work together very intimately. ''We
are talking here about a high degree of physical intimacy -- showers,
and so forth.''
Overt homosexuality was likely to cause understandable tension
different to that engendered by difficulties over race.
There was laughter in court when Lord Justice Brown asked: ''If you
were not prejudiced against homosexuals, why does it actually worry you
to shower with them?''
Mr Richards said it was not very different from requiring men and
women to sleep in the same accommodation and to shower together. There
was the possibility of feeling ''sexually threatened''.
The judge asked counsel if he accepted it would be quite wrong for the
MoD to have regard ''to what can only be properly called prejudice on
the part of other serving men''.
Mr Richard said there could be circumstances, such as in wartime,
''where the ultimate objective of maintaining an efficent fighting force
may require one to give in to prejudice in a particular situation in
pursuit of the higher, important goal of the defence of the country''.
In reply, Mr David Pannick QC, for the four applicants, said: ''If one
applies even a modicum of rationality, it is impossible to understand
why a person in battle should be concerned with whether the person
alongside him spends his evenings in bed with a man or a woman.
''It is impossible to understand why a soldier should be concerned,
other than that his colleague is trustworthy and whether he can be
relied upon. That must depend upon all aspects of character and
personality.''
All Britain's allies in Nato and the Commonwealth, except Turkey and
Luxembourg, now allowed homosexuals to serve in their armed forces, and
there had been no problems, said Mr Pannick.
The MoD's stance was ''based on nothing other than speculative and
irrational fear''.
The hearing was adjourned until today. Lord Justice Brown said it
would also continue on Friday, when judgment would be reserved to a
later date.

Bridging the Forth: P&amp;O's Royal Princess sailed under the Forth Rail
Bridge yesterday and became the first cruise ship to dock at Rosyth
Naval Base. The Ministry of Defence gave permission for Captain Ian
Tomkins to tie up his 45,000-ton vessel, and give passengers a day
ashore, instead of the half-day which the tide at Leith docks would have
allowed. Thirty coaches took the 1200 American tourists on board for a
tour of the Trossachs, Fife, and Edinburgh, before the ship cast off
last night, heading for Norway to complete a 13-day voyage around
north-west Europe.

Kikwit, Wednesday
ZAIRE'S outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has entered a new phase,
spreading to the community at large, doctors in this town at the centre
of the epidemic said today.
''There are people dying in the city. People are dying in the
community. Now it is showing up among people in the community,'' Dr
Mungala Kipasa, director of Kikwit General Hospital, told reporters.
Many of Mungala's best staff have died from the lethal virus, which
kills up to nine out of 10 victims and for which there is no known
vaccine or cure.--Reuter.

Washington, Wednesday
YET another member of the Clinton administration is to be subject to
the ministrations of a special prosecutor.
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown will be investigated for his business
dealings before joining the government, and for allegedly misstating his
finances and connections with business partners when he was appointed.
There are already three special prosecutors at work: one looking into
the Whitewater affair, and the others investigating Secretary of Housing
Henry Cisneros and former agriculture secretary Mike Espy.
Espy resigned when the attorney-general sent his case to the courts,
which appointed a special prosecutor. He was accused of fiddling his
expenses.
Cisneros is accused of concealing the extent of payments he had agreed
to make to a former mistress.
As for Whitewater, by far the most serious of the four, the special
prosecutor continues to investigate the Clintons' business connections
with the bankrupt Arkansas savings and loan association, Whitewater.
He is due to decide within the next week whether to indict one of
Clinton's closest friends, Bruce Lindsey, who is now special assistant
to the president. He is accused of failing to report various financial
dealings in Clinton's 1990 re-election campaign as governor of Arkansas.
Brown is a more considerable political figure than either Cisneros or
Espy. He was chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and presided
at the party convention in 1992, and then directed Clinton's election
campaign. He is the top black politician in the country.
He insists he is innocent of all wrong-doing and, so far at least, has
refused to resign.

Sarajevo, Wednesday
BOSNIA'S UN peacekeepers faced an uncertain future today as fighting
again flared in Sarajevo and plans were being discussed to cut their
numbers.
The Bosnian capital was rocked by heavy shelling for a second day as
the Bosnian army and rebel Serbs fought for land overlooking the south
of the city.
The fighting shattered a pledge by both sides to avoid further action.
It was yet another empty promise negotiated hours earlier by the United
Nations after what it described as the worst fighting in the city for
two years.
The new battle came as UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said
he favoured cutting the number of blue helmets and redeploying those
left because of the threat to their safety as Bosnia slides back into
all-out war.
In Brussels, Nato diplomats said a plan to withdraw the 22,000
peacekeepers was ''virtually complete'', but they called it a
''terrifying worst-case scenario'' that all sides wanted to avoid.
In Sarajevo, the beleaguered UN requested air presence over the
capital as the government army and Serb forces pounded each other with
artillery, mortars and small-arms fire.
Nato jets could be heard roaring high above the city 30 minutes after
the UN request. But the deterrent effect of the Nato air presence has
long since worn off as far as the fighters on the ground are concerned.
The two sides were battling for positions on a steep hillside known as
Debelo Brdo overlooking a key Serb-held supply route.
Twelve people were wounded in the fighting. At least three were
military casualties but most others were civilians struck down by shell
and sniper fire on Sarajevo's streets.
A Russian peacekeeper was also seriously wounded and a French
anti-sniping team narrowly escaped injury when a mortar bomb exploded
within 50 yards of their post. Two peacekeepers, one French and one
Russian, were wounded in fighting around the city yesterday.
In New York, Boutros-Ghali said he would ask the Security Council to
consider several options for the future of UN troops, but he made it
clear he favoured reducing and regrouping the force with a modified
mandate.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said tonight Britain has no immediate
plans to withdraw its peacekeepers from Bosnia and had not taken any
decision to reduce them.
''We have not taken and we're not imminently going to take a decision
about withdrawal,'' he said in Washington before talks with American
Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Britain is the second largest contributor to the UN protection force
in former Yugoslavia. France has the most troops there.
Hurd said it was necessary to look carefully at the options put
forward by Boutros-Ghali ''to see how and in what circumstances the UN
can continue to perform a worthwhile mission in conditions of reasonable
efficiency and safety''.
Meanwhile in Bosnia the UN-designated ''safe area'' of Bihac town was
shelled as government troops captured the Serb town of Ripac after
punching out of the Bihac enclave.
Serb forces responded by shelling government-held Bihac town, killing
three civilians, he added.
Ripac, about six miles from Bihac town, has been under Serb control
since an abortive offensive by government troops late last year in which
they seized it briefly and broke through Serb lines.--AP/Reuter.

New York, Wednesday
A BRITISH woman who was arrested and charged with murder eight months
ago after trying to carry her dead baby onto an airplane was released on
bail today.
New York State Supreme Court Judge Robert Hanophy agreed to a bail
arrangement between defence and prosecution lawyers that requires
Caroline Beale, of Chingford, Essex, to remain in the state and
surrender her passport.
''Her bail is basically her parents' house in England, which is worth
about $150,000,'' Beale's attorney Michael Dowd told reporters in New
York. ''We have arranged a place for her to stay, but I'm not saying
where or what kind of place.''
Beale, 30, was arrested in September 1994 at John F. Kennedy
International Airport when she, her common-law husband and two of his
brothers were about to board a flight to London after a holiday in New
York. She told police she had given birth in a Manhattan hotel room but
the child was stillborn.
Beale, who concealed the corpse under her coat at the airport, also
said she hid her pregnancy and the birth from her husband, Paul Faraway.

Paris, Wednesday
CONSERVATIVE Jacques Chirac was inaugurated as French president amid
republican pomp today, taking power for a seven-year term from Socialist
Francois Mitterrand who served a record 14 years.
Within hours, Chirac appointed fellow Gaullist Alain Juppe, 49, as
prime minister. Juppe was foreign minister in the outgoing cabinet of
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.
Presidential sources said a new centre-right government would be
announced on Thursday afternoon.
In his inaugural address, Chirac pledged to restore France's social
cohesion and make the fight against unemployment his priority. He vowed
to be a less regal, more hands-off head of state, leaving the government
to govern.
Military bands played and a 21-gun salute resounded near Napoleon's
tomb at Les Invalides war museum as Constitutional Council president
Roland Dumas proclaimed Chirac the fifth president of France's Fifth
Republic.
''France is an old country but it is also a young, enthusiastic nation
ready to give the best of itself if only it is shown a horizon and not
narrow, closed walls,'' the new president declared.
In his five-minute speech, Chirac said he would use every effort to
restore France's cohesion and overcome the ''scars, fractures and
inequalities'' caused by mass employment, at a near-record 12.2%.
''Employment will be my constant concern,'' he said.
The French franc slumped against the deutschemark on currency markets
because of what dealers said was speculation that the new president
might abandon his predecessor's strong franc policy or seek a currency
realignment with Germany.
There was no immediate official comment on the rumours, which sent the
franc down three centimes to 3.5640 per mark, uncomfortably close to an
all-time low of 3.5880.
Chirac, 62, who was prime minister twice in 1974--76 and 1986--88 and
served as mayor of Paris for 18 years until his resignation yesterday,
won the presidency at the third attempt on May 7, defeating Socialist
Lionel Jospin. A centre-right government is expected to be announced by
Friday.
Chirac had a one-hour handover meeting with Mitterrand, 78, before his
ceremonial inauguration.
The outgoing president briefed him on state secrets and gave him the
launch codes for France's nuclear strike force before leaving the
presidential palace as an ordinary citizen to be feted at a reception by
his Socialist Party.
Chirac was later driven up the tree-lined Champs Elysees avenue to the
Arc de Triomphe waving to crowds in an open-topped limousine and laid a
wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
He had begun the day by flying to Colombey-les-deux-Eglises in eastern
France to lay a wreath on the grave of his political mentor, General
Charles de Gaulle, leader of wartime Free France and founder of the
Fifth Republic in 1958.
The office he inherits wields more powers than any other elected
Western leader.
In his inaugural speech, Chirac promised a better balance between the
executive, legislature and judiciary.
He said he would be an arbiter and ''guarantor of the public good'',
leaving the government to conduct policy, giving parliament a fuller
role and granting more resources to an independent judiciary.
In a symbol of the new simplicity he promised and a break with
Mitterrand's regal style, Chirac had his venerable Citroen CX car stop
at red lights on the drive to the Elysee Palace.
In one of his first acts as president, Chirac is to meet German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl tomorrow in the French border city of Strasbourg.
The early meeting was intended to stress Chirac's wish to build on the
Franco-German partnership which is central to the European
Union.--Reuter.

Orkney, South Africa, Wednesday
TENS of thousands of South Africans marked a national day of mourning
today for the 104 men who plunged to their deaths a week ago in one of
the country's worst mining disasters.
The main ceremony, led by Nobel peace prize winner Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, took place at this dusty gold mine 95 miles southwest of
Johannesburg, where a runaway train crashed down a shaft killing the men
in their lift which was smashed 450 yards to the pit floor.
Referring to miners as ''these brave men'', Tutu said:
''I want us to remember that when South Africa becomes a prosperous
country, it is prosperous because of them.''
At the end of the service he led the 35,000-strong audience at a
sports stadium named after mining magnate Harry Oppenheimer, in chants
of: ''We are Free, all of us, black and white together, the rainbow
people of God''.
Sitting under sunny skies, the crowds had listened at mine officials,
politicians and trades unionists expressing grief and dismay at the
tragedy.
The mine, South Africa's second largest in terms of production, closed
for the day, as had many others throughout South Africa.
Mine officials said repair work started last night on the Number Two
shaft where the miners plunged to their deaths last Wednesday.
''It is a matter which has touched the whole country . . . it is a
unique disaster,'' said President Nelson Mandela, speaking in Cape Town
before the services.
More than 10 million rand ($2.74m), has so far been donated to a fund
for the victims' families, scattered throughout South Africa, Swaziland,
Mozambique and Lesotho.
Zacharia Tlolo, acting premier of Northwest province where the mine is
located, said 3000 miners had died over the past five years in South
Africa.
''Clearly no civilised country can allow such a situation to prevail.
We strongly believe the workers themselves should take the lead in
occupational safety.''
Molatsi blamed racial discrimination for the disaster.
''A black man's life is considered very cheap. If a black man's life
was not considered cheap this could not have happened,'' he said to loud
applause.
Among dignitaries at the stadium were Mines Minister Pik Botha, Anglo
American chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson and ANC Secretary-General
Cyril Ramaphosa.
Botha was howled down by a section of the crowd and was only able to
speak after an appeal by National Union of Mineworkers president James
Motlatsi, who said the former foreign minister was at the mine
representing Mandela.
''President Mandela has asked me to assure you that the government is
determined to see to it that puzzling questions around this disaster are
fully investigated . . . as soon as possible,'' Botha said, announcing
an inquiry commission would be headed by Judge Ramon Leon.
The government wants quick answers to how the accident happened and
the train was able to plummet down the shaft, by-passing safety
measures.
To cheers and applause, Botha said a memorial should be placed at the
bottom of the death shaft, 7550ft beneath the surface, with the names of
the victims, ''to ensure they are never forgotten''.--Reuter.

Vienna, Wednesday
A SENIOR bishop withdrew his support today from Austria's Roman
Catholic leader Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer two days after the primate
pleaded for understanding for his silence over sex abuse claims.
Paul Iby, Bishop of Eisenstadt, told state radio he could no longer
adhere to earlier statements in which he defended the 75-year-old
cardinal.
''I have been in the meantime better informed and I am not able to
stand by the cardinal's side in such a clear way,'' Iby said. ''Also
because he has not given us (bishops) a very clear statement.''
Iby joined a long list of Catholic lay organisations and some liberal
bishops demanding that Groer admit or clearly deny allegations that he
sexually abused a pupil at a Catholic boarding school for boys 20 years
ago.
Commentators said the bishop's words were all the more surprising
because they came two days after Groer made what many believed to be his
definitive statement on the affair.
Groer, Austria's primate and Archbishop of Vienna, said he found it
impossible to defend himself against such accusations and all that he
could do was to remain silent.
''The only thing left to me is silence,'' Groer said in a statement on
Monday.
''Admittedly for some that has become a burden. Those who have borne
it with trust, I thank you, and those for whom my silence is unbearable,
I ask for your forgiveness,'' he added.
Groer's statement prompted a reaction from the man who accused the
cardinal of sexual abuse in a magazine interview in March.
''All I want is for the cardinal to admit his guilt,'' Josef Hartmann,
now 37, told Austrian television on Monday.
A survey has shown that the number of Austrians quitting the church
had doubled since the start of what has become known as ''the Groer
affair''.--Reuter.

six-year-old Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, from Lhari district of Nagchu in

THE more Mr Michael Portillo goes on television saying that
unemployment is no longer a problem, the more he displays how out of
touch he is and how little he cares, according to Ms Harriet Harman
yesterday.
Labour's Shadow Employment Secretary was addressing the annual
conference of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation in Inverness, shortly
after the reduction in unemployment had been announced.
She said unemployment remained a crucially important issue for those
two million plus people who were out of work. ''But it is also an issue
for those in work. Many of the people now in work have recently been out
of work. The figures are absolutely extraordinary.
''Over the last five years, 11 million have had to claim benefits at
some time or another by virtue of being unemployed. When they return to
work, they take with them that fear and insecurity from not knowing when
you will get your next pay packet.''
People also felt insecure because they know that when they fall out of
work they get less help from the Government, she said. ''Indeed, they
get the rug pulled from under their feet, as we have seen with the
abolition of unemployment benefit and its replacement by the Job Seekers
Allowance.''
Ms Harman said such insecurity was preventing the people from
experiencing any feel-good factor. The levels of youth unemployment also
remained unacceptably high. ''One in five of young men under the age of
20 are unemployed.''
She said that for every young person unemployed there were one or two
parents at home worrying themselves sick ''. . . and they don't feel
very good about that''.
It was also worrying the way people were being forced to take
part-time and temporary jobs, because they were replacing full-time
permanent jobs in the economy.
The real level of wages in whole regions had fallen for the first time
in many years, and there was no protection against exploitative low pay.

* Around 100 new jobs are in the pipeline for unemployment-hit
Kirkcaldy, thanks to a partnership between British Coal Enterprise Ltd,
Fife Regional Council, Kirkcaldy District Council, and Fife Enterprise.
The opportunities are expected to be created over the next five years
through developments at the town's Mitchelston industrial estate.
Today, BCE will lay the first bricks of a new workshop complex which
will provide accommodation for new and expanding businesses, from Fife
and beyond.
The 11 units totalling 25,000sq ft are being built at a cost of #1.4m,
40% of which will be met by the European Regional Development Fund.
Councillor Bill Brand, chairman of the region's economic development
committee, said: ''The partnership between BCE, Kirkcaldy District
Council, Fife Enterprise, and ourselves simply demonstrates what can be
done when a number of organisations work together to tackle the economic
challenges facing Fife.''

SCIENTISTS are excited by the discovery of a spider with 16 legs which
can out-run a rat.
The insect, mercifully measuring a mere 2.5 millimetres, is believed
to be the only one of its type in the country.
Mr Frank Park, from Irvine, stumbled across the creature while
studying spider communities in an Ayrshire peat bog. ''It seems to have
two sets of legs where it should only have one,'' he said. ''It might
just be a one-off.''
It is to be photographed for scientific magazines. It is hoped that a
reader might come up with an answer to its origins.
''I don't think it's a new species. In order to be classified as such
it has to be able to reproduce and this one appears to be sterile,''
said Mr Park.
''Its sex organs aren't fully developed. That's the only way you can
identify different spiders.''
Some particularly fertile species can produce up to 50 eggs in one go.
Most lay eggs and allow the young to fend for themselves.
However, Mr Park's wolf spider -- so called because it does not trap
its prey with a web but stalks and pounces on it instead -- carries her
young for up to eight days after birth. Because she is cannibalistic,
she might choose to eat them if the hunger pangs get too much.
Here in Scotland a spider's lifespan is around two years. Smaller
species often die after a few weeks.
The spider most likely to be hanging from your cornice is the
funnelweb. It is easily identified by its dark brown shape and large
body.
''All spiders in this country are poisonous but not to humans. They
can give you a wee nip but it's not as bad as a wasp or bee sting.
No-one in Britain has ever died from a spider bite.''
''They're fascinating creatures, especially when you see them
underneath a microscope,'' said Mr Park, who last year brought home 9870
of them.
''Their structure is so complex. Some of their legs don't use muscles
but act like a hydraulic system where fluid is pumped into them. That's
why they move so fast.
''They keep the bugs and insect population down. For instance, one
study estimated two million spiders in an acre of grassland. If each
spider was to eat just one item of prey a day, think of the number of
insects that would be devoured.''
His wife Fiona and daughter Gillian, six, have lived with his hobby
for the past two years since the biology teacher began a second honours
degree at Paisley University.

THE taxman is poised to take most of the #850,000 expected to be
raised in an auction of furniture, paintings, and artefacts from Keir
House, the former Perthshire home of Mr Archibald Stirling of Keir.
Mr Stirling says the cost of insuring and storing the 1400 lots --
valued from #40 to #50,000 -- and growing tax bills, forced the sale, to
be held over three days next week.
''It also seemed a bit of nonsense to have all this stuff in storage,
when it wasn't being used or seen,'' he explained.
More than 1000 prospective buyers are expected during the four-day
viewing, starting today, which will be held in two large marquees at the
Doune and Dunblane showground.
The items, which range from a tiny 1937 Riga Minox spy-camera to a
mahogany four-poster bed and two paintings valued at almost #50,000,
have mostly been stored since the sale of the family home, Keir House,
in 1975.
The sale includes works of art from other estates once owned by the
Stirling family, including Cawder, near Glasgow, and Ardchullarie,
Perthshire, while other items have been retrieved from Morar Lodge,
Inverness-shire.
The Stirling family have the one of the longest and best- known
genealogies in Scotland.
They claim descent from David, Earl of Huntingdon (an English earldom,
held by the Scottish royal family), who was the brother of King William
the Lion (1165-1214), through Walter de Striuelying who lived in the
mid-fourteenth century.
Mr Stirling admitted that he would not be watching the fall of the
hammer on every item in the auction: ''That will be too hard to bear.
''And we won't be taking a holiday from the proceeds of this sale.
Most of what we take will be going to pay the taxman.''
Mr Peter Arbuthnot, Christie's managing director in Scotland said:
''Logistically, this has been one of the most complicated sales
Christie's has ever held in Scotland.''
Highlight of the sale is a pair of paintings by Philipp Peter Roos
which are valued between #30,000 and #50,000.

in Strasbourg
BOTH Conservative and Labour Parties in the European Parliament were
deeply divided last night after a bruising tussle over the future
direction of the European Union.
John Major and Tony Blair were defied by substantial numbers of their
own feuding Euro-MPs when a vote was called on a policy document laying
down the parliament's view of how Maastricht's rules should be
tightened.
Mr Blair's heavy pressure on Labour to abstain was ignored by 15 of
Britain's 62-strong Labour contingent -- including Mrs Glenys Kinnock.
Fourteen -- including half of Scotland's Labour Euro-MPs -- voted for
the report and one against it.
Mr Major's private instruction to his 18 Tories to vote against the
report was ignored by 10 who abstained. The 10 rebels included the group
leader, Lord Plumb.
After three-and-a-half hours of non-stop voting on more than 200
amendments the parliament's monthly plenary adopted a watered down
series of policies which, if implemented at next year's Maastricht
review, would reduce but not remove completely the veto powers of member
states.
It will be seen by Eurosceptics as a lurch towards federalism if its
recommendations are adopted by an inter-governmental conference.
It would also put pressure on Britain to sign up for the Social
Chapter of Maastricht -- which the Tories are sworn never to do -- and
make qualified majority voting routine in all but exceptional cases such
as constitutional change, harmonised taxation, and member state's
community contributions.
One outcome of the continued agonies of the Tories on Europe could be
a fresh alliance of centre-right parties in the parliament. Mr Jacques
Chirac, the Gaullist new French president, meets Chancellor Helmut Kohl
of Germany in Strasbourg today. It will be Mr Chirac's first political
act and is designed to salute the importance of the Franco-German axis
in the European Union.
His visit coincides with moves by the Gaullists in Strasbourg to join
Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Europa allies in a formal voting bloc. It
is now thought likely that the Tories -- who also were reported to be
seeking an alliance with the Gaullists -- will invite the new group to
join them in European People's Party. The EPP is strongly federalist and
has often had strained relations with the British Tories who are nominal
but semi-detached members.
''If we all got together we and the Gaullists could help to make the
EPP a more pragmatic group and much less ideological. But nothing is
decided yet,'' one Tory said.
As the Tories were reflecting on their latest European fall-out,
Labour was putting on a brave face after most of the party broke ranks
with their socialist group colleagues, including the group leader, Mrs
Pauline Green, a London Euro-MP, who voted for the report.
Mr Wayne David, EPLP leader, insisted there was nothing illogical
about Labour abstaining in a vote which sought British participation in
the social chapter (which is Labour policy). ''There are good elements
in this report and it would have been unhelpful to vote against it,'' Mr
David said.
Mr Ken Collins (Strathclyde East), who is the parliament's most
influential committee chairman, also voted for the report against Mr
Blair's wishes. He was joined by Mr Bill Miller (Glasgow).
Mrs Winnie Ewing (SNP, Highlands and Islands) did the same (her
colleague Dr Allan Macartney was absent at a funeral) and she also won
the assembly's support for an amendment seeking more protection for
fishermen under the common fisheries policy. Britain's two Liberals
voted for the report.
Lord Plumb, a noted pro-European, said the report was launching the
Maastricht review down the wrong road for Europe.
''Public opinion across the Union wants us to advance more carefully .
. . our electorate does not want member states to be outvoted on key
decisions in security policy, or on frontiers or on tax harmonisation.
It does not envisage the imposition of Europe-level taxation or the
acceptance of future treaty changes without the agreement of all member
states.''
But he justified his abstention by saying he still believed the
practical outcome of the Maastricht review would be closer to Tory
thinking.
The post-Maastricht debate now moves to Messina in Sicily next month.

SNP LEADER Alex Salmond yesterday challenged Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang to a face-to-face debate in Scotland on the issue of independence
versus the status quo.
In a Scottish Grand Committee debate at Westminster, set against the
background of the Perth and Kinross by-election, the two confronted each
other as Mr Lang sought to belittle SNP claims that Scotland could pay
its own way as an independent nation.
Mr Lang, who opened the debate, persistently refused to allow Mr
Salmond to intervene in his speech. When Mr Salmond eventually rose to
defend the SNP's position, the Scottish Secretary tried to intervene. Mr
Salmond bluntly said he would not give way unless Mr Lang accepted his
invitation to ''a debate in Scotland on even terms''.
He told Mr Lang he only had to nod his head for the debate to take
place. As the Scottish Secretary remained in his seat, Mr Salmond said
the committee would note he had not accepted the challenge.
In his robust defence of the current constitutional position, Mr Lang
said the SNP's policies would lead inexorably to economic and industrial
blight, high unemployment, and marginalisation from European and world
markets.
He claimed Scotland's position within the United Kingdom was crucial
to the success in attracting business. Scotland needed a powerful voice
in Europe to ensure that the concerns of its industrial producers,
service industries, farmers, fishermen, and consumers were given full
attention.
Mr Lang told the committee: ''With 8.8% of the UK population, Scotland
at present gets 10.3% of the UK's identifiable public expenditure. This
means that Scotland gets some 17% more public expenditure per head than
the UK average and 21% more than England. This is a substantial
difference amounting to over #3bn in 1993-94 in Scotland's favour,
compared with what we would have if we had been given our strict
population share.
''Even with a generous 80% allocation of North Sea oil revenues (a
proportion which might be hotly contested in the event), Scotland would
still have a huge budget deficit. Our estimate is that it would stand at
almost #7bn, still nearly half the size of the total Scottish Office
budget and over a quarter of all public expenditure in Scotland.
''The key point can be made emphatically. Scotland has a huge budget
deficit and, under the present constitutional arrangements, derives very
considerable benefits from the Union.
''To balance the budget, a separate Scottish government would either
have to borrow at unsustainably high levels, or raise taxes, or cut
Government expenditure substantially -- or a combination of all three.''
Mr Lang also attacked Labour's plans for a Scottish assembly, stating
there would be concern over the support to business development and
exports, fears over corporate and individual tax rates, the risks of
Scottish competitiveness being undermined and potential damage to
established and potential inward investment.
The SNP found itself on the receiving end of attacks by all three
other Scottish parties, while the Government, Labour, and the Liberal
Democrats argued over devolution.
Mr Salmond vehemently denied Government claims that Scotland was
subsidised by the rest of the UK, adding that it ''more than paid its
way''.
He argued that the most important consequence in economic terms of
Scottish independence would be a significant improvement in the Scottish
economy and enhanced prosperity.
He claimed Government figures were three years out of date and that
rather than being a financial burden on the UK economy there was ''a
small but identifiable surplus of about #30m''.
He told the committee: ''The argument that constitutional change is
going to scare away investment is not supported by the people who are
actually doing the investing. Just over a century ago, Scotland was the
most prosperous country in the world by GDP per capita -- now it is
21st. We have the opportunity to turn that process into reverse.''
For Labour, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said the
Government had chosen the debate because it faced a ''drubbing'' at
Perth and Kinross. It suited the Government in its present predicament
to polarise the constitutional debate but, in ''endlessly repeating the
lie that the only choice is between separatism and the unreformed status
quo,'' it was ignoring ''the favoured option of (Defence Secretary)
Malcolm Rifkind and the Scottish people'' -- a devolved parliament.
He insisted that separatism was ''simply unsellable'', and added that
the voters of Perth and Kinross wanted to make a real difference.
''They know that a victory for the SNP would irritate but would be
written off simply as a protest, whereas a Labour victory would send a
shock wave to the heart of Downing Street,'' he said.
For the Liberal Democrats, Scottish leader Jim Wallace (Orkney and
Shetland) said: ''Nothing like the majority of the Scottish people want
to break up a union in which we have built up many common ties of
kinship. There is a considerable need to reform that Union but I do not
believe the majority of Scottish people want to break it up.''

THE Tories' chances of holding Perth and Kinross are the longest odds
ever for such a by-election, according to the bookmakers.
Conservative candidate, Mr John Godfrey, has fallen from 20-1 second
favourite to third place at odds of 66-1.
Bookmakers William Hill said yesterday that no party defending a
constituency in a by-election has ever slipped to such odds.
However, one of Mr Godfrey's campaign aides said: ''This is an
excellent bet and we look forward to counting our winnings on March
26.''
At the outset of the campaign, the bookies were taking no bets on
favourite, the SNP's Roseanna Cunningham. She is now quoted at 6-1 on.
For novice punters, that means for a #1 stake your winnings would
total less than 17p.
Labour candidate, Mr Douglas Alexander, has come in from 50-1 to
100-30, sweeping past the Tories to become the main challenger.
Liberal Democrat, Mrs Veronica Linklater, has not yet been quoted with
only a week to go to the poll.
Mr Alexander said: ''It looks to me like Labour have gone from rank
outsiders to a good bet, while the Tories are almost non-starters. We
are coming up fast on the outside.
''Personally, I have never so much as bought a lottery ticket in my
life -- prudence not puritanism -- but the Labour campaign manager has
inside information and says we are well worth a few pounds.''
SNP chief executive, Mr Michael Russell, countered: ''Bookies are
always canny observers of by-elections.
''The fact that they have made Roseanna such a strong favourite
suggests they are confident that only the SNP can win this by-election
and only the SNP can beat the Tories.
''The Labour odds sound as if they are there to entice a flutter and
get punters to lose their money.''
The disastrous Tory standing comes with their campaign team still
reeling yesterday from Mr Godfrey's doorstep gaffe. He urged protest
voters to opt for ''anyone but the SNP,'' an apparent endorsement of the
Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates.
Ms Cunningham said she had never heard of such a thing said by any
politician.
Liberal Democrat candidate, Mrs Linklater, admitted some sympathy for
the Conservative candidate. ''I would pat his little head,'' she said.
For Labour, Mr Alexander seized on the Conservatives' doorstep tactics
as evidence that they had thrown in the towel.
Supported by Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harmen, he argued
that only a Labour Government would deal with issues such as the minimum
wage and the growing tax burden faced by poor families.

A SENIOR Tory accused the Government yesterday in the Commons of
''betraying'' home owners and risking disaster at the General Election
if it continues to alienate them.
Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield), a strident critic of Ministers
on many policy aspects, listed steps taken by the Government since March
1991 which he claimed were ''a series of Treasury-inspired blows to
confidence in the housing market''.
These included scrapping higher rate mortgage interest tax relief and
capping the size of mortgage eligible for income support.
Mr Winterton, chairman of the Manufacturing and Construction
Industries Alliance, predicted falling house sales and values every
month until the General Election.
''Estate agents report that their sales are almost 20% down on the
period to the end of April compared with the same period in 1994.'' He
added: ''The Halifax Building Society reports prices beginning to
fall.''
He called for immediate Government action -- ''they cannot wait until
the Budget in November'' -- to halt the trend, in particular the raising
of the ceiling on Miras -- Mortgage Interest Relief At Source -- from
the current #30,000 to #50,000 at the 25% standard tax rate for
first-time buyers.
Mr Winterton also seeks ''the discreet ditching of the electoral
millstone of proposals to restrict mortgage interest support''.

Strasbourg
European Parliament's creaking procedures were attacked by Mr Neil
Kinnock yesterday after he was given only three minutes to present a
plan for EU transport projects worth #75bn.
Mr Kinnock, European Commissioner for Transport, was presenting a
report for a first reading containing the so-called Trans-European
Networks plan, a blueprint for a better EU rail and road infrastructure.
The money will be raised from public and private sources in the EU
member-states between now and the end of 1999.
The plan envisages spending #738m by the year 2010 on upgrading the
Glasgow-London West Coast railway line, one of 14 priority projects
agreed at last year's Essen summit.
It also backed a plan to upgrade the Edinburgh to Inverness line (via
Kirkcaldy, Dundee and Aberdeen) -- but not to make the Dundee-Aberdeen
link high speed. It rejected extending the electrification of the West
Coast line to Mallaig. The Mallaig element of the project had been
backed by Euro-MPs and the Scottish Office but a commission official
remarked: ''These are supposed to be trans-European networks, not
tourist routes.''
Mr Kinnock also ruled against EU support for electrification of the
Glasgow-Edinburgh line.
His speech had to be curtailed after a series of procedural problems
disrupted yesterday morning's business during the Parliament's monthly
plenary. His appearance before Euro-MPs also clashed with a state visit
to the Parliament by Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish President.
Later, an angry Mr Kinnock called for faster progress in a series of
continuing procedural reforms designed to make the place work on lines
more similar to the Westminster system.
He also attacked the continued expense of moving thousands of
bureaucrats, political back-up staff, Euro-MPs, and Commissioners every
month from Brussels to Strasbourg at the insistence of the French
Government.
Mr Kinnock sat down abruptly in the assembly's debating chamber after
telling Euro-MPs he would not read his speech but would circulate it in
written form.
''I am not getting at the Parliament -- but at its procedures,'' Mr
Kinnock told reporters, adding that in his three minutes he had been
expected to deal with 238 amendments.
''It would be helpful if we did not all have to pack our bags every
month and move to Strasbourg. There should be more intensive use made of
Brussels,'' he said, referring to a new #800m parliamentary complex in
the Belgian capital which is used for mini-sessions of the plenary only
two days a month.
British Labour Euro-MPs have attacked the estimated #50m expense of
moving to Strasbourg and blamed Mr John Major for putting his name to
the deal making it the Parliament's permanent home, brokered with the
French at Edinburgh in exchange for a successful summit.
Mr Kinnock said the Parliament had been refused a proper say in the
projects but that they would not be delayed. ''In fact, we are three
months ahead of schedule.''
Britain has three projects in the top 14. The other two are a road
route from Ireland through Wales and England to the Continent and a rail
link from London to the Channel Tunnel.
A major Irish rail project will mean upgrading work in Stranraer and
consequent improvements to the A75 road through Galloway to the Border.

RAF investigators last night were examining a second Nimrod
reconnaissance aircraft, which developed engine failure 12 hours after a
Nimrod ditched in the Moray Firth on Tuesday.
The second plane returned safely to its base at Kinloss in Morayshire
early yesterday, after a full emergency response when its pilot sent out
a distress signal off Ireland.
Once again, the problems appeared to have been in the Nimrod's
starboard engines. On Tuesday, both starboard engines of the plane which
ditched off Lossiemouth caught fire.
There was confusion over yesterday's incident. Initially, the Ministry
of Defence stated that ''the outer engine on the starboard side . . .
was on fire'' but this was later contradicted by RAF Kinloss, where a
spokesman said there had not been a fire, and sought to play down any
links with a fault in the ditched aircraft.
Although the Ministry then issued an amended statement, referring to a
''suspected fire in one of the engines'', and the Nimrod has a superb
safety record over 25 years, there is bound to be concern that two
similar aircraft could be hit by engine difficulties within such a short
time.
The RAF has already categorically denied rumours that the Moray Firth
casualty had been affected by fire earlier in the week.
Squadron Leader Brian Horrocks, media liaison officer at RAF Kinloss,
said yesterday: ''The safety record of the Nimrod is excellent and it is
far too early to say what may have caused either incident. It will be up
to investigators and the board of inquiry to decide what went wrong.''
He said he was unaware of any extra safety checks which might have to
be carried out: ''It is business as usual.''
The officer said engineers had removed the engine from the second
plane and had identified the problem, which was a mechanical fault
similar to faults which had occurred before.
''It is just like a part going wrong in your car. It happens, then you
take it to the garage and have it fixed. That is what happened here and
the aircraft returned to base at Kinloss without incident or danger to
any of the crew,'' he said.
The second incident involved an aircraft with a crew of 13 on routine
reconnaissance duties over the North Atlantic. It was north-west of
Ireland when the alert was sounded shortly before midnight on Tuesday.
Fire crews and ambulances were called out at RAF Machrihanish in
Kintyre and at the airports at Prestwick and Aldergrove, near Belfast,
before the pilot reported that he had shut down one engine and was
proceeding home on the three remaining engines.
Meanwhile, the co-pilot of the plane which ditched in the Moray Firth
said he and the other five crewmen on board owed their lives to Flight
Lieutenant Art Stacey, who achieved the first controlled forced landing
of a 90-ton Nimrod.
Flight Lieutenant Pat Hewitt told a news conference at Kinloss: ''Art
did an outstanding job. He is unquestionably the best pilot in the
Nimrod team. If it was not for his skill, we would not be having this
meeting today. He saved seven lives. We lost the aircraft but that was
going to go anyway.''

A MULTIPLE sclerosis victim who had her leg amputated after a fall has
been discarded by her family doctor.
Mrs Moira Copland, 44, of Balornock, Glasgow, and her husband Bob, 45,
were asked by GP Dr Deirdre O'Driscoll to find themselves another
doctor.
When Mr Copland went to the surgery of another GP suggested by Greater
Glasgow Health Board, he was told she would rather not have them either.
Last night, with Mrs Copland's supplies of prescription medicines
dwindling, the health board promised that the couplehad been assigned to
a new GP and that a letter to that effect was on its way.
Their MP, Mr Michael Martin, said: ''If they are not fixed up with a
GP, I will be raising the matter with the Scottish Health Minister Lord
Fraser. I am deeply disturbed at what has happened -- it is not the
first time in my constituency.''
Mrs Copland has fought against MS for 17 years, and not has failing
eyesight, incontinence, and weakened muscles. She fell and broke her
thigh last year and her leg had to be amputated.
Three weeks ago, they were shocked to receive a letter from Dr
O'Driscoll, who practices at Springburn Health Centre, saying:
''Unfortunately, due to recent events, following which we find it
difficult to maintain a satisfactory doctor-patient relationship, we
have no choice but to ask you and your wife to register with another
doctor.''
Mr Copland, who has given up work to care full-time for his wife,
said: ''I couldn't understand it. We have always had a very good
relationship with her. When she visited Moira in hospital, she said:
'I'm not your GP, I'm your friend.'
''Only a few days previously, I had asked if it was suitable to take
Moira on a caravan holiday to Ayr the following week and she said it
would be the best thing for her.''
The letter left the couple with the prospect of going on holiday
unregistered with a GP.
The week-long holiday passed without mishap but, on Tuesday, Mr
Copland went to keep an appointment with another GP, Dr Sweeney, whose
name he had been given by the health board's department of practitioner
services.
''I was supposed to bring Moira but I had a heavy dose of the 'flu and
didn't think it was suitable. I didn't get to see the doctor at all.''
Instead, he said, the receptionist went in to the doctor, came back
out, and said: ''Either bring your wife another time or, better still,
go back to Mr Henry (at practitioner services) and register with another
doctor.''
Mr Copland said he had asked Dr O'Driscoll about the possibility of
his wife receiving Interferon Beta, an expensive and controversial drug
said to halt the progress of MS but not yet available in this country.
''There was no confrontation about it -- we were on perfectly good
terms last time I saw her,'' he said.
Neither Dr O'Driscoll nor Dr Sweeney were available for comment.
A health board spokesman said: ''GPs are entitled to have patients
removed from their register and are not required to give a reason. The
Coplands asked for help in finding another GP and there are two ways we
can help -- by giving them a list of other GPs in the vicinity, or by
assigning them to a GP.
''Initially, the first course of action was taken and one of the
people suggested was Dr Sweeney who, I understand, refused to take them,
as she was entitled to do.
''They asked yesterday to be assigned to a GP and this has now been
done.''
Mr Martin said: ''Whilst I have the highest regard for the doctors in
this constituency, it is not a desirable state of affairs when a lady
who is very ill is being denied access to a doctor, and her husband, who
is the carer and doing a very important job, is also denied access.''

In 1990, he moved to Aberdeen as a depute director of education,
becoming senior depute two years later and director last year.
''I am obviously delighted to have got the job,'' he said last night.
''The big challenge is to be at the head of a large progressive local
authority which has a long tradition to build on and will be looking to
create a future for the people of Aberdeen.''
Mr Paterson lives in Peterhead and is married with two daughters.
Also shortlisted for the post was the current Aberdeen City chief
executive, Ms Anne Mearns, 47, a former Glasgow City Council depute town
clerk.

PLANS for what is thought to be the first medical suite of its kind in
Scotland for victims of sex crime will be unveiled today.
Lothian and Borders Police hope that the unit, in the grounds of an
Edinburgh hospital, will help encourage more victims of abuse to come
forward.
Existing medical examinations in hospitals or at doctor's surgeries
cannot provide an equal level of privacy.
Strathclyde has four examination suites, but all are within police
stations.
Lothian and Borders Police Board will be asked to consider leasing
accommodation within the grounds of Edinburgh's Royal Victoria Hospital
in Craigleith.
The police believe the location of the proposed facility will provide
''a most desirable level of privacy'' as well as comfort and equipment
not usually available in hospitals or surgeries. It could also enhance
the quality of evidence provided to the procurator-fiscal.

HABIT-forming activities came up in the Commons yesterday. In a
confused point of order, Mr Paul Flynn (Newport West -- Lab.) asked the
Speaker -- the Sketch finally worked out -- if Ministers really meant it
when they linked two Commons questions at different points on the order
paper together saying ''with permission Madam Speaker'' before giving
the answer.
If they did, said Mr Flynn, but we are translating from gobbledygook
here, could Madam Speaker intervene because Ministers were linking or
not linking questions depending on what was to their party's advantage.
Miss Boothroyd said that Ministers had ''got into the habit'' of
uttering this phrase but they did not really need her permission. The
phrase ''has become habit-forming'' she said. In other words, Ministers
were just being polite.
Otherwise, politeness was not much in evidence. Indeed we had some
nasty exchanges between Mr Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton -- Con.),
aided by Mr Roger Knapman (Stroud -- Con.), and Mr Peter Hain (Neath --
Lab.), which brought Ms Boothroyd to a fine state of incandescence in
which she told them that the British public deserved better and
eventually refused to listen to any more.
Labour, having feasted on cash-for-questions, delightedly found they
could gorge on cash for amendments as a next course. Such things they
think are seriously habit-forming and they favour the cold turkey
treatment for those who are hooked. Sir Jerry Wiggin (Western Super-Mare
-- Con.) was in South Africa, defiantly opining that to make a fuss
about a chap putting down parliamentary amendments in another chap's
name -- even if the chap was being paid to do it -- -- was ''a storm in
a teacup.''
Needless to say, that was not how the Opposition viewed it, nor the
Speaker, who said she would take thought speedily about what should be
done and is pretty likely to suggest that Sir Jerry be referred to the
Privileges Committee, perhaps doing so even today as the House debates
Nolan on standards in public life.
Many Tory MPs are furious about several television programmes which
portray MPs who are either explicity stated or understood to be Tories
as philandering, corruptible creeps. However, while that is, of course,
quite untrue about the vast majority, enough of their colleagues have
been getting themselves into the news to suggest that art may be
imitating life rather than the other way around.
Mr Hain asked the Speaker to protect him from Mr Duncan who, he said,
despite his frequent denials persisted in accusing him of being the
stoolie who spilled the Wiggin Story to the media.
Mr Duncan shot up and accused Mr Hain of having used parliamentary
privilege on a number of occasions to utter untruths about him. Mr
Knapman asked the Speaker to recall that Mr Hain twice had apologised to
the House for making false allegations.
As Speakers go, Miss Boothroyd has a short fuse and the flame reached
the end of the train as the Tories and Mr Hain tried to get at each
other again. She was not putting up with any more, she said, only to be
diverted by Mr Flynn's point of order. Ministers may be hooked on
politeness but some back benchers are finding it more fun to get high on
spite and bile.

IN A DETERMINED attempt to rid Labour of its old tax-and-spend image,
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown yesterday announced plans which would see
tight restrictions on Government borrowing and spending if the party
came to power.
No-one should doubt his ''iron resolve'' to insist on prudent
financial management, he said, addressing the party's Finance and
Industry Group.
He plans a shake-up of the Bank of England, which would curb the power
of Governor Eddie George by requiring him to consult a new policy
committee before deciding on interest rates.
Mr Brown said that Labour would set inflation and other targets, but
leave day-to-day decisions to the reorganised Bank. It only would borrow
for investment not to cover day-to-day expenditure.
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce, pointing out that
Mr Brown had not indicated what inflation target he would select, added:
''These are Polo Mint proposals with a black hole of uncertainty and
evasion in the centre.''
Mr Brown said he wanted to move away from the ''damaging
personalisation'' of what was described as the ''Ken and Eddie show'' --
meetings between Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Mr George to fix interest
rates.
In his speech, the Shadow Chancellor said ''Brown's law'' was that
Government would only borrow to invest, public debt would remain stable
and the cost-effectiveness of public spending must be proved.
''My strategy is not based on an irresponsible programme of tax, spend
and borrow, but of prudent investment for growth.''
He promised that a Labour Government would only borrow to finance
public invesment and not to fuel public consumption.
In a warning to the party's left wing, Mr Brown said there would be an
onus on departments to seek partnerships with the private sector where
appropriate.
A strengthened programme would be built into the public spending
process so that waste and in efficiency in existing public spending
departments would be ruled out, he said.
Mr Brown insisted Labour would be tough on inflation.
The war against inflation was a Labour war, he said. ''Inflation is an
enemy of the poor, the pensioner and the middle income family. It
destroys savings and undermines long-term investment and therefore
jobs.''
He said the Bank of England should establish a new monetary policy
committee which would decide on the advice given to the government.
It would comprise the governor and deputy governor -- both appointed
by the government -- and six directors including the Chief Economist
also appointed by the government.
All normally would serve seven-year terms on a rolling basis.
Mr Brown stopped short of making the Bank fully independent -- which
would let it raise or lower interest rates at will.
However, the Government must rebuild confidence in the current
structure and rebut the charge that decisions on interest rates were
being made on political grounds.

GOVERNMENT proposals to privatise the nuclear power industry will cost
the average householder #660, kill off most of the few remaining
collieries and see the loss of ''hundreds'' of jobs at Babcock at
Renfrew and Weir in Glasgow, it was claimed yesterday.
The message was taken to London yesterday by trade union
representatives, many of them from Scotland, in a lobby of MPs to
co-incide with the initial Commons debate on the issue.
Union officials representing the 2200 Scottish Nuclear employees today
will be raising the same issues with Scottish Office Industry Minister
George Kynoch.
However, probably their best chance of delaying the privatisation --
of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear as one entity -- lies in the
hands of National Power and PowerGen and City investors.
The two big English generators are currently obliged to close down
some 6000 megawatts of coal-burning capacity, but may well baulk at this
if a privatised nuclear sector is seen as being poised to upset previous
calculations by joining the ''dash for gas''.
The unions are convinced that a privatised nuclear industry would mean
no more nuclear stations but cheaper gas-fired capacity installed on
existing nuclear sites which would mean even greater problems for the
two dozen or so surviving collieries.
Mr Tony Cooper, general secretary of the Engineers' and Managers'
Association and secretary of the Electricity Supply Trade Union Council,
maintained that the estimated #3.5bn proceeds of the nuclear
privatisation would go on pre-election tax cuts leaving the taxpayers to
find the #10 billion at the rate of #660 per household.
Mr Doug Rooney, AEEU Scottish regional organiser, warned that
privatistion would mean no new nuclear installations which would have a
disastrous effect on many supplier companies especially Babcock at
Renfrew and Weir in Glasgow and Manchester.

WITH love from the top of the world, British climber Alison Hargreaves
yesterday sent a message to her family.
Still savouring her triumph at becoming the first woman to climb
Everest unaided and without oxygen, she said in a fax to her children
Tom, six, Katie, four, and husband Jim Ballard, at Spean Bridge,
Inverness-shire:
''Hi, team:
''I am now at Base Camp -- very tired -- but happy after climbing the
world's highest mountain.
''We have problems with our satellite tel/fax -- but this has
obviously got through to you!
''Tomorrow a jeep will drive me towards Nepal -- and for my first bath
for eight weeks! -- wish we could share it.
''After a few days I can fly back and see you all in sunny Scotland.
With much love from Tibet.''
The message ends with a sketch of ''Mummy'' on top of the world.
More details emerged yesterday of Alison's record-breaking conquest of
the 29,028ft mountain on Saturday.
She left her advance base camp, at 20,992 feet, on May 11.
Steady progress took her to ''top camp'' at 27,230 feet on May 12.
Next day, she set out for the summit at 0440 hours, following the
approach which in 1924 claimed the lives of George Mallory and Sandy
Irvine.
At 1208 she reached the summit, where she stayed 45 minutes in perfect
weather and marvelled: ''I could see forever.''
She then began her descent, losing her radio on the way.
On May 14 she arrived at advanced base camp, and the base camp two
days later, on Tuesday.
Next month she leaves for an attempt to scale the 28,253ft K2, the
world's second-highest peak, in the Pakistani Karakorum Range, in the
Eastern Himalayas, regarded as an even more demanding climb than
Everest.

PERTH-based bus operators Stagecoach are preparing to invest in an
experimental ''bus way'' route between Edinburgh airport and the city
centre, in partnership with Lothian Regional Council.
The cost of the project -- which would allow coaches to avoid
Edinburgh's notorious traffic jams by travelling along a dedicated road
-- is still uncertain, but Stagecoach chairman Brian Souter yesterday
said he would be prepared to pay a percentage.
The route would be six to seven miles long and would run along the old
Corstorphine railway. Mr Souter said the project could be under way
within three years.
Giving evidence to the Commons Select Committee on Transport
yesterday, Mr Souter said investing in major infrastrucutre projects was
one of the directions in which the bus industry would have to go in
order to survive.
Mr Souter said that it was useless for coach operators to invest in
new coaches if they were only going to wind up stuck in traffic jams.
The next step, he argued, would be for operators to raise capital to
invest in building new bus lanes, which they would then operate.
Afterwards, he said: ''Once built, we can fund it commercially and
speed up running times. Edinburgh has a bus-way proposition which I
think may very well meet the criteria. It will happen in the next two or
three years.''
The idea of a ''bus-way'' originated from a Stagecoach project in
Colombia. Building a separate lane for buses is far cheaper than
building a railway, and allows the flexibility of having buses leave the
route to go into other areas.
However, Stagecoach argues that for such a project to succeed the
Government would have to introduce road-pricing -- making drivers pay
for using the roads, based on mileage and time of travel -- something
the Government has examined but so far refused to do.
Challenged by some MPs to explain Stagecoach's expansion, Mr Souter
denied his company practiced predatory pricing.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair has won a crucial battle in his fight to go
into the next General Election without a commitment to a pre-set minimum
wage, it emerged last night.
Labour's joint policy committee has agreed on a paper stating that a
minimum wage should be implemented ''sensibly and flexibly'', according
to prevailing economic circumstances and taking account of the impact on
jobs.
A commission or review body would be set up to consult with employers
and unions on what level it should be set at.
The proposals -- approved on Tuesday although details were not
released until last night -- will not head off continuing rows on the
controversial issue which will surface at the October party conference .
The move is likely to anger some of the big unions, such as the
Transport and General Workers, which have pressed strongly for
commitment to an hourly wage set at half male median earnings.
However, the Labour leader's aides are presenting the policy as an
example of the party's new attitude of treating the trades unions with
''fairness, not favours''.
The party said it would campaign for a minimum wage on grounds of
social justice and seek to win public support. However, it made it clear
it would examine in more detail the implications of a minimum wage, in
consultation with unions and employers.
The policy paper now has to go forward to the national executive
committee in two weeks' time. However, with Mr Blair's supporters in the
majority, it looks unlikely to be overturned.
The TUC, while happy that it figures in Labour's consultation process,
still plans to press for its formula of half median male earnings, which
mean minimum rates of between #3.50 and #4.15 a week.
Despite the pledge to consult industry, business leaders remain deeply
suspicious of a minimum wage, claiming hundreds of thousands of jobs
could be threatened.
The Confederation of British Industry council warned that unemployment
would ''significantly increase'' if a minimum rate of #4.10 an hour was
introduced. The move would add 1.5% to the national wage bill,
equivalent to #4.5 billion, the organisation warned.
''Our discussions with employers suggest that hundreds of thousands of
current jobs would no longer be economically viable,'' said a CBI
spokesman who added that setting a minimum rate of #3 an hour would have
less impact but could still affect 750,000 workers who are paid below
that level.
However, the CBI said it was happy to debate the issues with Labour
and the unions and announced a special seminar on the minimum wage would
be held in July.

PERSONALITY clashes dominated debates on the railways in the Commons
yesterday as Liberal Democrats and Labour attacked Ministers over the
future of Scotland's rail services.
In the Scottish Grand Committee, Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton turned on Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy after
being repeatedly barracked over his personal view of railway
privatisation.
Later, in a Commons debate, Labour accused Transport Secretary Brian
Mawhinney of presiding over a ''universally detested'' privatisation,
and claimed the fare cap announced recently will cost the Government
#500m in additional subsidies.
Closing a committee adjournment debate, Lord James said the
privatisation would benefit ScotRail, and the fare cap and minimum
service requirements would guarantee services.
Opposition MPs repeatedly challenged him with ''what's your view?'',
until a visibly angry Lord James interrupted his speech to accuse Mr
Kennedy (Ross Cromarty and Skye) of being frivolous.
''The Scottish Office has no direct responsibility for rail services.
It's no use the Honourable Member addressing me as though I will make
the decisions, when in reality those decisions are the precise
responsibility of another department of state,'' he said.
Mr Kennedy told MPs that the Government's rail privatisation programme
was in a ''complete and utter muddle'', and he accused Lord James of
failing to defend Scotland's interests.
However, he was prevented from raising the controversy over the West
Highland sleeper by chairman Michael Martin (Glasgow Springburn -- Lab.)
because of the pending court case.
He called for a three-year moratorium on cuts to services ''to allow a
proper and much more commercial and aggressive marketing exercise''.
Winding up the later Commons debate for Labour, Mr Henry McLeish urged
British Rail to abandon its forthcoming appeal against the court ruling
that sleeper services to Fort William must be maintained for the
meantime: ''They must start to listen to the travelling public, not the
Government,'' he said.
The debate focused on railway finances. Labour Transport spokesman
Michael Meacher said the Government was increasing subsidies in order to
ensure franchise operators made ''a decent profit''.
Dr Mawhinney, pledging to halt the ''erosion'' of rail services, said
subsidy from the taxpayer was vital to protect commercially unviable
lines.
The Labour motion attacking the privatisation plans was defeated by
279 votes to 255, a Government majority of 24.

SCOTS-born businessman John Robb was confirmed last night as the new
chairman of the holding company that will run the privatised nuclear
electricity industry.
The announcement was made as MPs debated the recent decision to merge
the Scottish and English nuclear operations, with the headquarters in
Scotland and the two companies allowed to some extent to operate as
separate entities.
It always was understood that the chairman of the new holding company
would be Scottish, and yesterday the Government opted for Mr Robb, who
was chief executive of Wellcome PLC from 1990-95.
As the holding company is not yet established, Mr Robb, 59, will
initially act as an adviser to the DTI.
It was also announced that the present chairmen of Scottish Nuclear
and Nuclear Electric, James Hann and John Collier, have agreed to serve
as deputy chairman of the holding company.
Executive directors will be appointed as soon as possible and a
non-executive director from each of the subsidiary companies will serve
on the main board.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said: ''I believe this structure provides
a strong foundation for the new company's future.''
In the Commons last night, the Government faced a Labour attack
claiming that privatisation of the nuclear power industry was unwanted
and unnecessary, and was not based on a long-term assessment of
Britain's long-term energy needs.
It was dismissed as a ''short-term move, designed to raise money for
tax cuts before the next General Election.'' Taxpayers would be left
with the bill for the decommissioning of Magnox stations, and the claims
of guarantees on distinct identities for Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear
Electric were worthless.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''The party opposite
is addicted to privatisation. Having got rid of the last family spoons,
they are down to nuclear reactors. This is an act of a Government in
desperate and terminal trouble.
''This privatisation is nothing to do with energy policy or industrial
strategy. It is just a cynical and desperate attempt to raise money for
tax bribes before the next election.''
However, Mr Lang strongly defended the Government's move.
After a tough Cabinet battle, he endorsed the decision to create a
holding company with its headquarters in Scotland, with the parts of
Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear that are to be privatised as its
wholly-owned subsidiaries.
He said safety would continue to be of paramount importance when the
industry was in the private sector, telling the House: ''The proposals
are unalloyed good news for the industry and its employees, the taxpayer
and electricity consumers.''
For the SNP, party leader Alex Salmond issued a statement in which he
challenged claims that electricity prices would fall in Scotland by 8%
in real terms between 1994 and 1996.
He said: ''I am calling on the Scottish Office to give a clear
breakdown of the figures. It is extremely difficult to imagine how a
nuclear merger of Scottish assets and English liabilities could produce
such a fall in prices, when the fossil fuel levy does not apply to
Scotland.''
At the end of the debate, Labour's criticism of nuclear privatisation
was defeated by 284 votes to 252, a Government majority of 32. The
Government's welcome for the outcome of the nuclear review was approved
by 272 votes to 251, a majority of 21.

<TEXT>
GLASGOW'S director of environmental health, Mr Brian Kelly, has urged
caution over claims that samples of mince bought from 10 Glasgow shops
contained millions of bacteria, and all 10 samples contained the
potentially fatal E-coli bacterium.
A report tonight in the BBC's Frontline Scotland series claims that
one sample of mince contained 170,000 E-coli bacteria and another sample
contained a billion other bacteria.
Mr Kelly said that a finding of 170,000 E-coli bacteria in one sample
did appear high, but that he would need to know details of how the mince
sample was handled, how long it had been kept, and how it had been
analysed before he could make an informed comment.
He suggested the programme makers had made a ''bad choice'' of
product, as one would expect raw meat to be contaminated to some extent.
Cooked chicken, cooked gammon, or coleslaw might have been a more
appropriate choice, he said, as they are sold ready-to-eat, whereas a
product such as mince still has to be cooked, a process which, if done
thoroughly, will destroy bacteria.
He described the report that millions of bacteria per gramme of meat
had been found in nine out of the 10 samples as ''of concern'' and ''an
indication of poor hygiene that one would not expect in mince''.
Mr Kelly said he was not surprised that E-coli bacteria had been found
as it was a bacterium found in animals' bowels and it was difficult to
prevent carcasses from coming into contact with bacteria when organs
were being removed.
He urged people to take care in the storage and preparation of food,
and said they should cook meat thoroughly, taking particular care when
using barbecues.
Glasgow has 6000 food businesses and it was because the food industry
was behaving responsibly as a whole that there were relatively few cases
of food poisoning, said Mr Kelly.
However, Professor Richard Lacey, who carried out the tests on the
mince samples at his laboratory in Leeds for BBC Scotland, demanded that
the Government take immediate action and set up a US-style food and
drugs administration.
''Salmonella, campylobacter, E-coli D157 and even BSE -- the problems
are all getting worse. It is the beginning of serious health problems
which we are not coping with,'' claimed Professor Lacey.

THE Government's Commons majority, currently 10, looks set to fall
further following the death yesterday of Mr Geoffrey Dickens,
Conservative MP for Littleborough and Saddleworth ,who had a majority at
the last election of 4494.
The by-election could be the first major test of the Blair effect. The
Liberal Democrats ran a strong second while, against the national trend
in 1992, Labour actually fell back to 19.9%.
Since then, the party has recovered and could make a strong bid for
victory. The area in the northern part of Greater Manchester is the type
of urban seat where Labour made substantial gains at the recent local
elections.
However a Press Association analysis of the local elections gave the
Liberal Democrats 46.3% of a low turnout, Labour 32.3% and the
Conservatives just 21.1%.
The by-election campaign could see Labour try to persuade not just
Conservative but Liberal Democrat voters to swing to them as the
alternative government.
The Liberal Democrats for their part will emphasise their position as
the obvious challenger and suggest that a Conservative candidate might
just survive if anti- Government voters split evenly between the two
Opposition parties.
Mr Dickens had been gravely ill with cancer for nearly a year.
However, he insisted on turning up at the Commons on more than one
occasion to support the Prime Minister in crucial votes where Tory
rebels were defying the whips.
Mr Dickens, who was 63 and married with two sons, was elected for
Huddersfield West in 1979 and in 1983 for Littleborough after spells in
local government in Hertfordshire.
A large outspoken personality, he once startled reporters by
presenting his mistress to a Westminster news conference and announcing
he had left his wife for the lady whom he had met at a the dansant in
London.
Later another lady friend surfaced but he and his wife were
reconciled, although some MPs labelled him ''Casanova''.
He maintained a steady attack on the activities of a paedophile groups
and produced a string of quotable quotes on issues of the day attacking
sections of the press for ''sleazy'' intrusions on the royal family, the
police for taking no action about Rolling Stone Bill Wyman's alleged
affair with Mandy Smith when she was 13, judges who he thought were too
lenient with criminals and the BBC for replacing spotted dick in their
canteen with the politically corect spotted Richard.
The Prime Minister yesterday paid tribute to Mr Dickens. Mr Major
said: ''I was truly saddened to hear of Geoffrey's death. My heart goes
out to his family.
''He will be remembered with great affection by his friends for his
great zest for life. Geoffrey lit up any room he was in.''
Mr Major described Mr Dickens as a ''hard working MP whose affection
for his constituents was always apparent.
''I will remember always the great courage he demonstrated through his
long illness.''
Party chairman Jeremy Hanley said: ''Geoffrey's determination and
irrepressible good humour throughout his illness was an inspiration to
us all.''
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher, MP for neighbouring Oldham
West, offered condolences to the Dickens family on behalf of Labour.
''He was a colourful political figure inside and outside Parliament
and will be greatly missed on all sides of the House. He was a vigorous
campaigner for the causes in which he believed and one of the most
effective communicators in politics,'' Mr Meacher added.

EDINBURGH University yesterday confirmed plans to close a unit which
helped to pioneer environmental studies in Scotland.
The Centre of Human Ecology -- which was founded more than 20 years
ago and has acquired an international reputation -- will shut at the end
of the current session.
Its two part-time academic staff have been told that their contracts
are not being renewed but post-graduate students will still be able to
undertake a masters course in human ecology, elsewhere in the
university's science and engineering faculty.
Among the centre's most recent publications was a report last month
which analysed the economic prospects of an independent Scotland and
concluded that political ''freedom'' would offer ''the potential for a
higher material standard of living and more jobs''.
Teaching director Mr Alastair McIntosh is closely associated with the
campaign against the Lingerbay superquarry on Harris and was a
passionate supporter of the proposal for community ownership for the
island of Eigg.
He alleged last night that the university was displaying ''a lack of
vision'' in failing to support the centre's holistic approach.
Mr McIntosh claimed backing for the centre from leading
environmentalists, Mr Jonathon Porritt and Ms Sara Parkin.
He also cited a letter from Mr Kevin Dunion, director of Friends of
the Earth (Scotland), which praised the centre's ''tremendous track
record in attracting thinkers at the leading edge of the environment''.
However, a university spokesman yesterday denied that there was any
''hidden agenda'' behind the closure of the unit.
He said the main reasons for the closure were the financial squeeze on
higher education and the fact the university had expanded
environment-related studies across the spectrum, including research work
worth #6m annually in 41 departments, and to 200 different courses.
''It was really down to a matter of conflicting academic priorities.
''The centre has done valuable pioneering work but it was felt that it
was not necessarily the best focus for further expansion.''
Edinburgh, added the spokesman, had probably the most extensive
programme of environmental courses of any UK university.

A GOVERNMENT proposal to set up a new Scottish examination and
assessment body could be counter-productive, the main teachers' union
said today.
In its submission to the Scottish Office consultation on the future of
the two existing bodies, the Educational Institute of Scotland said
there was a danger that a combined organisation could be mainly
concerned with secondary school awards.
If that happened, further education colleges and employers could turn
to English examination bodies for the services which they might perceive
were no longer provided by the combined body.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang made it clear when the consultation was
launched that he favoured forming a new body to take over the functions
of the Scottish Examination Board and the Scottish Vocational Education
Council.
The SEB conducts exams and awards certificates for secondary school
education, while Scotvec is responsible for vocational awards, many of
which are available in schools.
The case for merging the two bodies has been widely accepted in light
of the Government's blueprint for upper secondary education, which
involves a single framework of courses and assessment for fifth and
sixth years, and new vocational Highers and Advanced Highers to give
academic and vocational options equal standing.
The EIS accepts that assessment should be the responsibility of a new
examination body but that it should cover Scotvec's activities in
further and higher education.
It said Scotvec's ''fundamental function'' was to provide assessment
and certificates for FE colleges. The union welcomed the underlying
philosophy to guarantee giving vocational and academic education the
same esteem.
EIS deputy general secretary Fred Forrester said forming a new body
would be a bold move, because it would have more responsibilities than
examining organisations in other countries.
''If any significant group feels alienated from the new body, they
will look elsewhere, with serious consequences for Scottish education.
We must get it right first time, even if this takes longer than the
Government would wish,'' he said.
The senior chief inspector of schools, Mr Nisbet Gallacher, has told
secondary heads that schools will offer general group awards, while FE
colleges would be better equipped to offer more specialist awards.
He acknowledged that one of the challenges would be to merge
successfully the different assessment practices of the SEB and Scotvec.
Scotvec awards are made on the basis of internal assessment, while SEB
certificates are awarded on the basis of performance in external exams,
although there is some internal assessment graded by the classroom
teacher in Standard Grade subjects.

A KITCHEN manager found with drugs worth #4649 while working at
Butlin's Wonderwest World, Ayr, was jailed for five years yesterday at
the High Court in Kilmarnock.
Ian Barnes, 49, who had been in the Royal Navy and the Army, serving
three tours in Northern Ireland, admitted being involved last July in
the supply of ecstasy, amphetamines, and Temazepam. His plea of not
guilty to a further charge involving cannabis was accepted.
Advocate William Dunlop, defending, said the situation stemmed from
Barnes's gambling, which led to involvement with money lenders. He was
told that he could pay his debts by supplying drugs to other staff at
the holiday centre.
Mr Dunlop said there were threats of violence, both explicit and
implicit. ''He was kept on the hook and told: 'We'll tell you when the
debt is paid off'.''
Waitress Rose Mitchell, 42, with whom Barnes shared a chalet at the
camp and an address at Nithsdale Road, Pollokshields, Glasgow, admitted
being involved in supplying amphetamines. In her case, Lord Osborne
continued the hearing for two weeks for reports.

THE Government's announcement that it is to consider the privatisation
of Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd was condemned in the North last
night as utter madness.
The ownership of HIA, with its nine airports from Sumburgh in Shetland
to the island of Islay, was only transferred to the Secretary of State
from the Civil Aviation Authority on April 1.
But yesterday Mr Lang announced that he was commissioning consultants
to explore how the private sector might be involved ''. . in all or part
of the business of HIA with the objectives of ensuring the most cost
effective delivery of high quality airport services to users, both
passengers and air transport operators.''
Western Isles MP Calum MacDonald, whose constituency has three of the
airports at Stornoway, Barra, and Benbecula, reacted angrily: ''The
airports network is crucial to the transport system of the Highlands and
Islands and to our connections to the outside world. It must remain in
public hands.
''The idea of private operators running Barra airfield to make a
profit is the kind of mad fantasy that could only come out of a
politically bankrupt government.''
Councillor James Munro, chairman of Highland Regional Council's
development committee, agreed: ''This idea is nonsense and a waste of
public money to the consultants. I would have thought that the
Caledonian MacBrayne exercise would have taught the Government something
about providing services in this distinctively rural and scattered part
of the country.''
Meanwhile, the future operator of air services in the Western Isles
will be known within weeks following the completion of tenders forced by
changes in EU legislation.
The services between Stornoway in the Isle of Lewis to Benbecula and
from Benbecula to Barra will be the subject of a contract from the
Western Isles Council after the EU ruled against direct subsidies for
air services.
The council, along with the local authorities in the Orkney and
Shetland islands, applied for exemption from the rules arguing that they
were aimed at large national carriers seeking unfair advantage in larger
markets.
Their application was turned down by Brussels last year and a tender
process was started.
Yesterday, the council said that there had been considerable interest
in the contract but was unable to give any further details as the bids
remain confidential until being put to councillors.
What is known is that Loganair, which currently operates the services
under the British Airways Express banner, has applied and remains
confident of being able to continue links with the Western Isles
stretching back over 20 years.

THE Scottish Tory Peer who acted as unpaid adviser for an alteration
to the Gas Bill at the centre of a ''cash-for-amendments'' furore in the
Commons was nowhere to be found yesterday.
Lord Cochrane of Cults's home in Fife was occupied but no-one would
answer the door. He was also absent from his upmarket Craigton Meadows
Holiday Park, which lies one and a half miles from St Andrews.
Ironically, given the row, Craigton Meadows' 1995 brochure makes much
of winning for the second time last year the coveted Calor Gas award for
''Best Park in Scotland''.
A Calor Gas lorry was at the park yesterday, which nestles in woodland
and includes a licensed restaurant, shop with off-licence, an
all-weather tennis court and mini-gym.
All the caravans at Craigtoun Meadows have piped gas, according to the
brochure, which gives a weekly tariff for four people ranging from #115
to #270, depending on the time of year.
The charge rises to #350 during the British Golf Open, when a two-week
booking worth #700 must be made, while one of the park's lodges, for
five people, costs #1200 during the Open in July.
The parks' manager said yesterday that Lord Cochrane did not visit on
a daily basis, and added: ''I just run the place. I don't know what his
concerns are about gas. As for politics, you had better ask the owner.''
Lord Cochrane lists his special interests as the caravan and UK
holiday industry, railways, and the gas supply industry.
In 1993, he piloted a Private Members' Bill in the Lords -- in which
he declared an interest -- aimed at removing bureacratic procedures in
the supply of gas to holiday homes. Later, he advised the British
Holiday and Home Parks Association on an amendment to the Gas Bill which
would promote its interests.
That amendment, it is alleged, was subsequently tabled on March 30
this year by Sir Jerry Wiggin, an ex-Tory Minister -- and paid adviser
to the association -- under the name of MP Sebastian Coe, without his
permission.
It is stressed that there is no suggestion of impropriety in Lord
Cochrane's part in the ''cash-for-amendments'' affair and that strenuous
efforts by The Herald to contact the 68-year-old baron yesterday were to
no avail.
Last night, the British Holiday and Home Parks Association defended
its use of paid -- or unpaid -- advisers who sit in the House of Commons
or the House of Lords.
Its director general, Mr James Spencer, also spoke of the
circumstances surrounding the affair, which Commons Speaker Betty
Bothroyd confirmed it was ''seriously examining.''
It has been alleged in the Commons that Sir Jerry Wiggin, Tory MP for
Weston-super-Mare, tabled the amendment which would promote the BHHPA
while receiving an annual retainer from the organisation.
Mr Spencer confirmed Sir Jerry has been a paid adviser for ''just over
a year'', but stressed that Lord Cochrane was an unpaid adviser and is
also an association member, as a holiday park operator.
Mr Spencer also confirmed that Lord Cochrane had advised the
association on an amendment to the Gas Bill earlier this year which was
aimed at reducing the ''onerous burdens'' on members over gas supplies
to holiday parks.
Mr Spencer added that Lord Cochrane had advised on an amendment aimed
at reducing the ''draconian requirements'' on members when seeking
permission to supply caravans with gas.
Lord Cochrane's advice was on an amendment to the Gas Bill which would
exempt owners from the bureaucracy which could cause delays of a year in
expansion plans for pitches.
Mr Spencer added that the BHHPA passed on Lord Cochrane's advice to
Parliamentary agents, who prepared the amendment which was then sent to
Sir Jerry for tabling.
Mr Spencer acknowledged the seriousness of the allegation that Sir
Jerry, a paid adviser, had then lodged it under the name of another MP
without permission.
However, he was also concerned that ''any unhappiness which has
resulted about procedures that are being criticised'' could lead to a
break in connections between industry and Parliament.
Mr Spencer was adamant that organisations should be allowed to receive
advice from MPs or others with an interest in holiday and home parks.
He said the amendment based on Lord Cochrane's advice -- aimed at
exemptions for piped butane and propane gas -- had been withdrawn.

SIR Jerry Wiggin, the senior Tory MP at the centre of the ''cash for
amendments'' allegations could face suspension from the Commons.
The Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd, said yesterday she would consider
''with all speed'' whether to order an inquiry by the all-party
Privileges Committee into the latest claims of Tory sleaze.
She was responding to a Labour call for an investigation into the
affair which has again shaken the Conservative parliamentary party.
Sir Jerry, MP for Weston Super-Mare, admitted in a Channel 4
Dispatches programme last night that he tabled an amendment to the Gas
Bill during its committee stage in the name of another Tory MP, Mr
Sebastian Coe, without his knowledge.
The amendment -- withdrawn as soon as Mr Coe discovered what had
happened -- aimed at speeding up the supply of gas to holiday homes.
Sir Jerry, a former Defence Minister, is paid adviser to the British
Holiday and Home Parks' Association and would normally be expected to
declare an interest when tabling questions or amendments in relation to
a consultancy.
He admits on the programme asking other MPs to table amendments for
him in the past.
Mrs Anne Taylor, Shadow Leader of the House, said that Sir Jerry may
have used another Member's name to avoid drawing attention to the fact
that the amendment was related to his financial interests, and also that
he had indicated that this was not the only occasion on which he had
used other MPs in this way.
She said the Commons had recently taken action against MPs who took
cash for asking Commons questions. ''It now appears we have to
investigate the issue of cash for amendments,'' she said.
The action by Sir Jerry had been described as clearly in breach of
parliamentary rules, she added.
Sir Jerry was in South Africa with the Commons Select Committee on
Agriculture of which he is chairman. He is reported to have told friends
that he regards the row as ''a storm in a teacup''. But privately many
of his Conservative colleagues were extremely critical of him and
furious that the latest allegation of sleaze had come up on the eve of
the Commons debate today on the Nolan Report on standards in public
life.
A Downing Street spokesman said the Prime Minister regarded it as a
matter for the Commons. But he had always stressed the importance of
maintaining the highest standards in public life which was why he had
set up the Nolan committee and supported the broad thrust of their
recommendations.
There were bitter exchanges in the Commons between Mr Peter Hain
(Neath -- Labour) and Mr Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton --
Conservative). Mr Hain, who sat on the Gas Bill Committee, complained
that Mr Duncan continued to allege that he had ''collaborated'' with the
Despatches programme despite his frequent denials.
''I emphatically deny that,'' said Mr Hain. ''I had no contact with
them at any stage during the Gas Bill committee.
He added: ''This is an attempt to produce a smokescreen and divert
attention from the gross abuse of the House's procedures.'' Mr Duncan
told the Speaker that Mr Hain had several times used parliamentary
privilege to make statements about him which he knew to be untrue.
Miss Boothroyd refused to listen to either MP make further
allegations.
Despite Sir Jerry's absence abroad she said she planned to give a
ruling as soon as possible.
Earlier, Mr Duncan had pointed out that the Guardian newspaper used
the story prominently the day before its sister company, Observer Films,
the makers of the Dispatches programme, were scheduled to broadcast it.
He asked: ''Have the Guardian declared their interest in splashing
this and therefore advertising a film made by their own company? No they
haven't. There are always two sides to a story.''

RANGERS Football Club have called an extraordinary general meeting to
seek shareholders' approval for the long-term lease of the club's Albion
car park which is owned by a subsidiary of chairman David Murray's
property group.
In a complicated deal, Manchester-based NWS Property Investments Ltd
will pay one of Mr Murray's companies, PPG (Leisure) Ltd (PPGL), #3.9m
for a 125-year lease of the former training ground.
NWSPI will then sub-lease the car park back to Rangers, charging
#250,000 a year for the first five years, #330,000 from years six to 10,
increasing by 4% a year until a 34-year term is complete.
Thereafter, Rangers will pay a ''peppercorn rent'' of #3930 a year
until the 125-year lease is complete and the control of the car park
reverts to PPGL.
NWSPI is a subsidiary of the Bank of Scotland, which is also a major
backer of Mr Murray's privately owned group of companies, Murray
International Holdings, involved in metal, property, and leisure.
A financial expert predicted last night that it is possible the latest
proposal would create some unrest among shareholders, anxious that ''a
shuffling of assets'' was being arranged to accommodate the chairman's
business interests outside the club. This would mirror the response of
several shareholders who were angered when Rangers sold the ground in
April, 1990.
However, the club claims the move is the only way to guarantee the
future operation of its #22m club deck stand, building permission for
which was given by Glasgow District Council only on condition that a
minimum amount of car parking space was made available at the former
Albion training ground.
Mr Murray caused some raised eyebrows in September, 1989, when he
formed MBS -- a joint venture company -- with the Bank of Scotland.
Although the bank had only a 20% stake in the venture, it initially
advanced #30m in a revolving loan facility; #10m of that was used to
acquire five sites, including Rangers' Albion training ground and
another area of South Gyle in Edinburgh.
An extraordinary general meeting will be held in Govan Town Hall on
May 30 to consider the proposal.
The Albion car park has space for 1200 cars -- almost half of which
are taken up by corporate box holders and their guests and the holders
of the most expensive season tickets. The other spaces are sold to the
public on a first-come, first-served basis on match days.
Mr Douglas Odam, Rangers' financial controller, said the price of car
parking -- normally #2 per car -- would be reviewed only as part of the
club's overall operation of the stadium.
Because of the potential conflict of interest between Mr Murray's
property group and Rangers Football Club, Mr Murray will not take part
in the vote.

SIR Andrew Lloyd Webber was revealed yesterday as the bidder who paid
#18m for a Picasso painting at a New York auction.
The composer said in a statement that the picture, Angel Fernandez de
Soto, had been brought to London after the sale last week.
It was now being assessed for cleaning and conservation.
The auction of the Blue Period painting depicting the Barcelona
anarchist led to frenzied bidding.
The work finally sold for more than any other picture since 1990.
Sir Andrew bought it for his Art Foundation. After conservation work
is completed, trustees of the foundation will decide which British
museum will display it first.
''I am delighted to bring this painting to Britain,'' said Sir Andrew.
''It has long been an ambition for my foundation to own a major Blue
Period picture. I find it quite remarkable, and it has a mesmeric
appeal.''
Sir Andrew, whose personal fortune in 1994 was estimated at #300m, has
become an increasingly important collector of art in recent years.
In 1992, he paid a record #10.2m at Christie's for a Canaletto which
appeared likely to go outside the country. The composer stepped in after
the Tate Gallery failed in its attempts to pre-empt the sale.
''When they let me know they could not afford to pay more than #6m, I
realised we had to save it for the nation,'' he said at the time.
He described the eighteenth century work of art, The Old Horse Guards
From St James's Park, as ''quintessentially British''.
The painting, largely regarded as Canaletto's greatest English work,
was to be the first acquisition for Sir Andrew's charitable foundation
set up to buy art for Britain. It had not been sold since the artist's
lifetime, when it was acquired by the 4th Earl of Radnor.
He bequeathed it to Mr James Harris, later MP for Christchurch,
Hampshire. It was sold by his descendants. The painting shows the Old
Horse Guards building shortly before its demolition in 1750, and its
closely observed figures offer a microcosm of London life in the
mid-eighteenth century.

THE Government admitted yesterday that Rosyth Dockyard in Fife could
still continue repairing nuclear submarines -- less than a month after
The Herald revealed exclusively that problems were being encountered at
Devonport in Plymouth.
Mr Roger Freeman, the Defence Procurement Minister, confirmed that new
safety standards being demanded by the nuclear industry meant that
existing docks at the West Country yard would have to be strengthened
and upgraded.
The decision represents a spectacular U-turn since, at the end of last
month, the MoD dismissed as ''utter nonsense'' a Herald report which
predicted the Fife yard would continue to refit at least two of the
Royal Navy's nuclear hunter-killer submarines.
The prospect was also raised that the controversial #5500m Trident
refit contract might have to return to Rosyth because of safety
considerations at Devonport.
At that time, a spokesman for Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind
rubbished the report, saying: ''It is without any foundation at all. It
is absolutely unfounded speculation. It is just utter nonsense.''
Speaking at Rosyth before shuttling to London to answer a written
question in the House of Commons, Mr Freeman said the Ministry of
Defence was currently considering ways of limiting the resulting
disruption to the docking programme for nuclear powered submarines,
''including the possibility of deferring the ending of nuclear work at
Rosyth, which was previously planned for 1997.''
An assessment, he added, would include discussions with both the
nuclear regulatory authorities and the dockyard companies.
The news was welcomed cautiously by management and unions at Rosyth --
although Mr Allan Smith, chairman of Babcock Rosyth Ltd, said later that
he did not feel the decision would lead ultimately to the Fife yard
refitting the Trident fleet.
Mr Freeman was in Scotland to discuss the planned privatisation of the
yard, which he said should be completed by August, with private- sector
jobs created.
He went on to state that there were now problems in refitting the
Royal Navy's hunter killer submarines.
''We have two particular problems which are causing a backlog in the
refitting of hunter patrol submarines -- today, the nuclear standards
which are being interpreted in a tighter, tougher fashion, in
particular, the danger of earthquakes in dry docks.
''It is clear that remedial work on dock walls in Devonport will be
required and will have a knock-on effect.
''We are going to start a process of discussing with Babcock whether
they can take some more SSN refits beyond 1997.''
He admitted that while Rosyth would welcome the work, he was aware
management would not see the programme of refitting surface ships -- the
decision made by Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind in any way
jeopardised.
However, they may be forced to accept some form of trade-off. The most
likely option is that Devonport would insist on the contract to refit
the carrier HMS Ark Royal in exchange for being forced to give up the
submarine option.
The Minister said he could not state how many submarine refits Rosyth
may receive but said that so far as Trident refits were concerned the
contract was awarded to Devonport, although the Government would have to
be satisfied that any bids were consistent with the offer made two years
ago.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, Labour MP for Dunfermline East, called
on the Government to apologise for its mistakes.
''This move has been forced on the Government by its own errors,'' he
said. ''The Government must now admit its mistake over taking work from
Rosyth and Malcolm Rifkind should apologise for his errors.''
Later, Mr Brian Negus, leader of the Rosyth trade unions, emphasised
that the dock built at Rosyth to take the Tridents met the highest
seismic regulations but had lost out on a ''Dutch auction'' process in
which the rival yard repeatedly lowered its costs.
Nevertheless, he said the additional submarine work was welcome news
for the yard, which he considered the best for doing the job.

THE nurses' pay issue turned more bitter last night after the
Government threatened to withdraw the independent review body which
settles their wage rates.
The move by Health Minister Gerald Malone brought the dispute to fever
pitch and inflamed already angry nurses.
Christine Hancock, Royal College of Nursing general secretary, said
she was ''outraged'' by the threat and accused Ministers of a knee-jerk
reaction.
Nurses meeting at the RCN's annual congress in Harrogate, Yorkshire,
immediately passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in the Minister.
Mr Malone called the RCN's vote on Tuesday to tear up their no-strike
rule an ''extremely serious'' step calling their professional standing
into question. He added: ''This Government values the independent review
body and it values the professionalism of nurses.''
Echoing threats made by Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley in
February when possible industrial action over pay was first mooted, he
said: ''I am on record as saying that the history of the independent
review body is rooted in long standing consensus and that there would be
no industrial action.''
In a blatant bid to influence the forthcoming ballot of the RCN's
300,000 members who have to vote by a majority of two-thirds for the
rule change to be adopted, he went on: ''I am extremely anxious that the
RCN does nothing to undermine this consensus. I trust that when you go
out to ballot your members you will draw to their attention the logical
implications of going down this route.''
The review body was set up in 1982 to pull nurses back from the brink
of industrial action over pay and, in theory, take them out of the
industrial action arena for ever. But the recent award, singling nurses
out for local bargaining, left the body's claim to independence in
tatters in the eyes of the unions, which saw it as behaving more like a
tool of government.
Mr Malone also hit out at nurses' claims that any industrial action
would not harm patients.
''Do not deceive yourselves or the public that this can ever be the
case. You cannot pretend that messing up the administration of the NHS
does not mean damaging patient care.'' Patients would feel the pain --
''not those on the wards but those who will have to spend longer on the
waiting lists as a result''.
He added that it was wrong to suggest local pay deals put forward by
managers were punitive. On the contrary they were ''fair and
reasonable''. Three out four of the 321 trusts which had made offers so
far had offered 3%, he claimed.
The RCN denied it was deceiving the public over industrial action. It
had been made ''crystal clear'' that it would never take action that
would harm patients, it said.
The general secretary said she was ''absolutely enraged'' by the
letter and accused Mr Malone of adopting a ''very unwise, panicky
reaction''.
Miss Hancock claimed nurses had been singled out and asked why Mr
Malone had not sent an equally strong letter to doctors' leaders who
were currently balloting GPs on industrial action.

THE Chief Constable of Strathclyde, in the strongest-ever attack by a
Scottish police chief on Government policies, said last night that the
entire face of policing could change dramatically in the drive to make
police forces more like private businesses.
Mr Leslie Sharp, who intends to retire at the end of the year,
criticised the proposed two-tier police force -- street patrolling by
lower-grade officers or private security men -- which he dismissed as
''public reassurance policing on the cheap''.
The events of Derby on April 23 when people dialling for the police
were answered by unpaid volunteers ''sounded warning bells in my ears'',
he said. He went on to lambast the Home Office review of police core and
ancilliary tasks, the results of which are due out soon, and the
principal aim of which was, he said, to identify police tasks which
could be carried out by local authorities or private companies.
In England there were already signs that private police forces were
being established. One North-east council, dissatisfied with the cover
provided by Durham Constabulary, had established its own security force,
while one London borough had had to be dissuaded from setting up its own
police force. Instead it was to pay the Metropolitan Police for more
patrols.
Mr Sharp said: ''The idea of public bodies and even private firms
entering sponsorship schemes that would allow them to buy the exclusive
services of the police is abhorrent to me. There are ethical issues
which outweigh the short-term advantages.''
He made the criticisms in the Strathclyde University Continuing
Education Centre Town and Gown lecture sponsored by The Herald, giving
the first and clearest indication yet as to why he intends to quit the
police at a time when his force is scoring some of the most spectacular
successes ever achieved against criminals.
Mr Sharp intends to tell the Strathclyde Regional Council police
authority on June 8 that he is giving up the #75,570 job on December 31
and has said he will give no public reasons until his employers have
been properly informed.
Last night's lecture, however, left little doubt about his unhappiness
over the proposed developments and that he has decided to exercise his
option to retire rather than go down the Government's chosen road.
After detailing how his own force had reversed the apparently
inexorable rise in reported crime, including the use of his highly
successful 90-day campaigns against specific crimes and criminals, Mr
Sharp said it was quite wrong for the level of policing to be determined
by the ability of those receiving the service to pay for it.
While there had always been a role for properly constituted private
security firms to protect property, there were questions to answer if it
became the norm for security firms to be involved with public activities
and the behaviour of individuals.
While there were many tasks which the police would not be sorry to
lose -- such as escorting abnormal loads on motorways, handling stray
dogs, noise pollution enforcement, licencing of some routine activities,
or the serving of summonses on defendants and witnesses -- the service
would await with interest to see whether or not the Government
recognised that police involvement in many ancillary service tasks was
vitally important to the maintenance of trust, understanding, and
co-operation with the public, upon which the police depended for crime
prevention and detection.
He was critical of the Home Secretary's scheme to have those involved
in neighbourhood watches patrol their streets -- ''walking with a
purpose'' -- which, he said, was potentially dangerous for volunteers
who were untrained and unaccountable.
He attacked fixed-term contracts for chief constables and assistant
chief constables with annual performance bonuses as weakening the
much-valued independence of chief constables from political control.
''Central government has made it clear to the police service that it
wishes to focus attention on performance and accountability.
Performance-related pay is seen as a perfectly reasonable way of
managing scarce resources and rewarding people for good work. That may
be so in the market-place and I do believe that the police service
should be run in businesslike fashion. But that does not necessitate the
police service being regarded as a business. To do that corrupts the
police service ethic,'' he said.

A SENIOR Anglican churchman yesterday denied that he had condoned
adultery, claiming his remarks had been misinterpreted and that he had
been ''stitched up''.
The Most Rev Richard Holloway, Bishop of Edinburgh and primus of the
Scottish Episcopal Church, said he had half feared that what he took to
be uncontroversial remarks to a journalist would propel him to the
forefront of controversy.
He was speaking at a hastily-convened press conference in Edinburgh
only a few hours before he was to host the first in a series of four
seminars exploring the theme of Christianity and sex to an audience of
Edinburgh Episcopalians and Church of Scotland members.
Away from all the controversy, the speech itself went down well with
an audience of 100 churchgoers at St Cuthbert's Parish Church, in
Lothian Road, five times the number originally expected.
It was the reports previewing last night's seminar which sparked off
the controversy.
The bishop allegedly said during a telephone interview with a
freelance journalist during a visit to Lincoln: ''God has given us our
promiscuous genes so I think it would be wrong for the Church to condemn
people who have followed their instincts.''
However, as he arrived back Edinburgh yesterday, the bishop said he
was horrified to see his photograph gracing the tabloids, with headlines
to match.
''I ended up with a kind of coat over my head because people reading
the Daily Mirror, which had a characteristically tabloid headline,
obviously recognised me,'' he said.
He tried to put the record straight to a waiting media throng when he
got off the train at Edinburgh, insisting that his remarks were no more
than pointing out the basic tension between the natural urge to
procreate and the need for stable relationships.
He was not condoning adultery, merely exploring ways of helping people
avoid it, he said.
''The version that hit the press suggested I was saying that adultery
was not a problem or a sin and that I was condoning it, which is
absolute baloney,'' he said. ''I was stitched up.''
He continued: ''I think there are complexities in human sexuality
which it behoves us to understand, not necessarily to condone. I'm not
into condoning adultery, that's not even the theme of tonight's talk.''
He recalled the words of Jesus to a woman adulterer: ''Neither do I
condemn you. Go and sin no more.''
He went on: ''I am much more interested in helping people avoid these
situations, and recover from them. We are in crisis in our sexual
relations at the end of the twentieth century.
''One in three marriages end in divorce, more people are opting not to
get married, more and more children are born out of wedlock.
''It seems to me we need to look at this not just as Christians but
the whole moral community in Britain.
''If this whole fiasco does nothing but get people to think about
these questions, I shall, on the whole, think some good has come out of
a horrible mess.'' It was, mused the Bishop, the biggest media mess he
had got involved in -- ''but I'm a very indiscreet man''.
The bishop described the row as a ''fiasco'', a ''storm-in-a-teacup'',
and a ''kerfuffle''.
However, he accepted conceded some of the blame for the situation. He
said he had broken ''the number one rule of press relations'' by
speaking to a freelance journalist, whom he did not know, over the
telephone, instead of making a prepared statement.Later at the seminar,
one questioner cited scriptural authority that fornicators and
adulterers would not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.
Bishop Holloway said this passage was a Pauline fit and part of a kind
of Christianity that sought to bully people into righteousness,
compassion, and charity.

Instant wealth for the fortunate few and the constant come-on of
lesser prizes for the rest.
But losers far outstrip the winners.
After the Government has sucked 12p off the top, Camelot has grabbed
its chunk and retailers taken their share, all that's left is miserly
26p to be split among ALL good causes.
Like lining the pockets of the Churchill family who won a #13 million
jackpot thanks to grandpa's old paperwork.
As The Evening Times reveals today, the lottery has put charities on
the breadline.
Unable to pay staff and cutting back on vital services.
ALL TO SAVE THE GOVERNMENT PUTTING ITS HANDS IN ITS POCKET.
The National Lottery is nothing short of a national con.
