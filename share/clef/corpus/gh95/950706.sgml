SWIMMING
HOPE springs eternal in Scottish swimming. Having both survived a
tough season, Richard Hope and his sister, Kirsty, are now poised to
figure among the leading challengers for Olympic selection next year.
The pair currently are training with the Scottish squad in Lyon and
will go on to compete in the Canadian national championships in Winnipeg
at the end of this month.
Richard also is on course for another glamour trip to the World
Student Games in Japan next month. He currently is ranked No.1 in the
100 metres and 200m back-stroke for a side that will be named after the
English national championships on July 23.
Despite the upheaval of moving from the City of Dundee Club to
Warrender -- he has just completed a first year in accountancy at
Edinburgh University -- he has managed to produce his best times, and
won the 200m back-stroke at last month's Scottish championships.
''I feel I've made a reasonable progression, although it has been
difficult trying to settle in at university,'' he said.
The Olympic Games in Atlanta next summer are his prime target, as it
is for Kirsty.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association are to meet
Glasgow District Council in the near future with the hope of resolving
the branding problems which caused the sponsorship furore at last week's
Scottish age-group championships at the Scotstoun Pool.
Chris Reed, managing director of sportswear firm Hind, withdrew the
company's backing of all Scottish events because of the lack of
advertising within the pool area.

MILITANT councillor Tommy Sheridan left court yesterday unrepentant
after being fined #750 for breach of the peace.
Earlier Sheridan, 31, had been found guilty of pushing through a
police cordon during a protest about tree felling at the controversial
M77.
Outside Glasgow Sheriff Court he told supporters the fight against the
M77 extension would continue, and that they could expect ''no justice''.
Sheriff Kenneth Forbes, who was told Sheridan's income was #80 a week,
allowed him to pay #3 a week.
Last month the sheriff found Sheridan guilty of forming part of a
disorderly crowd at Pollok Park, Glasgow, last March.
Police claimed Sheridan refused to move back from a safety fence and
tried to push through their cordon.
Sheridan told Mr Alan Miller, defending, he was at the scene as the
local councillor and became concerned when branches started falling over
the fence.
Sheriff Forbes told Sheridan that a ''volatile situation'' had arisen
and added: ''Your attitude did not suggest that you were seeking to
temper this dangerous situation in any way, and it is significant that
after your arrest the crowd lost interest in the demonstration.''
Afterwards, Sheridan said: ''It galls me that I can be lectured in
these courts about legitimate demonstrations by people who have never
been elected to their positions and who have never been accountable to
ordinary people. They are out of touch.''

THE Scottish Blood Transfusion Service is to carry on using the brand
of blood bags implicated in the alert which has led to thousands of
donated units being scrapped in England and Wales.
The SNBTS said yesterday they were able to do this after carrying out
an exhaustive search of the Tuta bags for the heat seal fault discovered
in English bags, and introducing an additional quality control check.
A hospital patient in Swindon, Wiltshire, was fighting for his life
with septicaemia yesterday after receiving a blood transfusion.
Officials are investigating a leak in the bag.
The National Blood Authority, covering England and Wales, said they
were withdrawing all their Tuta bags from hospitals and bloodbanks after
it had emerged that the fault in the heat seals may have occurred
sporadically, rather than being linked to a number of specific batches.
None of the bags already filled and in stock at Scotland's 60
hospitals and blood banks was found to be affected.
The SNBTS have introduced an additional checking procedure.
General manager David McIntosh has told Scotland's hospital trust
chief executives that over the past 35 days these checks had shown up 10
faults in approximately 19,500 bags -- a fault rate of 0.05 per cent.
''This appears not to be above normal experience of general faults in
blood bags that are routinely inspected and rejected,'' he said.
''Unlike our English colleagues we have a long and very satisfactory
experience with the blood bags made by Tuta in Australia in 1965, and
they constitute approximately 80% of all blood bags used by our
service.''
The Tuta bags have been used for many years in Inverness, and since
1982 in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Hospitals serviced by the Aberdeen and Dundee regional transfusion
centres are more likely to receive their blood in Baxter bags made in
England, which have not been involved in the current alert.
The NBS expect the latest withdrawal to have a minimal effect on blood
stocks, thanks to the response to their special appeals at the weekend.

AT first sight, sports and GT cars hardly come into the realm of
executive choice. It is hard to imagine the average company car driver,
even of the user-chooser variety, being allowed to select some
rip-snorting mid-engined virtual racer.
However, there is one type of executive who is the dominant buyer of
some makes offering this kind of excitement. The owners of profitable
independent companies, with no horde of shareholders snapping at their
heels, often reward themselves with sporting cars far removed from the
familiar rep's saloon flogging along the motorway. Some
limited-production car manufacturers, here and abroad, would hardly
exist without their patronage.
Italy is the spiritual home of many owners able to make this kind of
choice. Fiat is putting really strong backing into Ferrari's famous
Maranello factory. The beautiful new F355, the older-style F512M, the
456 GT and the #329,000 supercar F50 use a mixture of awe-inspiring V8,
V12 and flat-12 engines, and come with some of Italy's finest coachbuilt
bodies.
In addition to the Quattroporte saloon, Maserati's UK importers bring
in the closer-coupled Ghibli and Shamal. These 2.8 and 3.2-litre
twin-turbo cars offer massive performance, but are remarkably
self-effacing on the road.
Lamborghini's outrageous-looking Diablo is on a sounder basis here,
now the concession is in the hands of Porsche Cars GB. The days when an
earlier importer was rumoured to accept calls only at five o'clock on a
weekday afternoon, because his base was a telephone box in one of the
London parks, are long gone.
The heart tends to rule the head as far as Italian sports cars are
concerned. German manufacturers, by contrast, take the solid engineering
view. Mercedes builds a series of unflamboyant but high-performing
sports two-seaters, starting with a 2.8-litre and building up in power
output and price to the majestic six-litre SL600 at #89,950.
At its Stuttgart neighbour, the 968 is the modern Porsche sports car;
the 928 soldiers on as the bigger GT. But Porsche customers' enthusiasm,
somewhat to the company's dismay, remains focussed on the updated,
tremendously quick flat-six engined 911 Carrera, clear successor, many
design generations later, to the prototype built in Austria in 1948.
Japanese manufacturers stayed out of the serious sports and GT market
for many years, but eventually succumbed. Mitsubishi brings in tiny
numbers of its 3000 GT. Subaru offers its typically way-out SVX, with an
all-alloy flat-six engine, four-wheel drive and almost fighter-plane
cockpit glass design.
Toyota's range includes a GT car with stand-out performance. The Supra
is fitted with a 24-valve twin-turbo three-litre engine, provides
prodigious acceleration, but keeps it on the ground with a quick-acting
traction control system.
Mazda's RX-7 is unique, the only car still offered with the Wankel
rotary engine. Current examples are equipped with twin turbochargers;
the engine note is a rising thrum which no piston unit can match, and
this is a power unit many of us would be sad to see abandoned.
Honda has always had sporting inclinations. The mighty and recently
relaunched NSX, with the option of open-top as well as all-enclosed body
style, is built virtually by hand, and now comes with the possibility of
semi-automatic transmission.
American expertise in providing stunning straight-line performance
from a hefty front-engined, rear-drive sports car is truly formidable,
as the V10, eight-litre Chrysler Viper shows with its 0-60mph time of
only just over 4.5 seconds and a test track maximum above 165mph.
Wisely, each owner is offered a day's racing school tuition as part of
the #57,500 retail price.
And the home team? Despite the uncertainty about its future, Lotus
still produces what are widely regarded as the finest-handling road cars
in the world. AC, currently up for sale, and Marcos persevere with tiny
production runs. TVR at Blackpool is making great strides with its
curious mixture of model names -- Griffith, Chimaera and Cerbera -- and
is that very rare thing indeed, a low-volume manufacturer which has
developed its own engine.
MG currently offers only the retro-style RV8, most production of which
has gone to Japan. But when the MGF arrives in September those who owned
a TD or MGA, Twin Cam or MGB may find a return to their younger days
irresistible.
Morgan hardly springs to mind as a builder of executive cars, but its
Plus 8 would make a major impact arriving for any business conference,
with its louvred bonnet and authentic thirties styling.
Aston Martin was pottering along producing its V8-engined Virage and
Volante in penny numbers. Then Ford took over and commissioned the
highly acclaimed DB7, which brought it back into serious international
consideration.
Jaguar still has a few unsold examples of its controversial XJ220
supercar tucked away. But the most super of all supercars is the McLaren
F1. It offers sensational performance, ultra-modern design and materials
and costs a brain-melting #634,500.
The owners of profitable independent companies often reward themselves
with sporting cars

THE growing popularity of 4x4s is measured by recent figures that
reflect the increasing number of motorists who use such vehicles. Many
were existing owners who changed for a newer or different model.
However, there are still a significant number of motorists who have
stepped up from the motor car into the 4x4 cab. In housing schemes and
urban developments around the country 4x4s are an ever-increasing sight.
It is arguable whether this urban breed will ever go off the road and
tackle rough terrain, more likely to encounter no more than the
occasional unmade road. But how do they perform off the road? For this
purpose we have taken five vehicles belonging to members of Thornhill
Young Farmers and asked their owners to give each a critical appraisal.
The vehicles in most cases, are regularly used off the road. But all
of them are used on the road to tow a trailer with loads varying from 50
sheep to five cows.
Power, comfort and handling while towing was an important aspect of
the vehicle and was highlighted by every one.
The vehicles fall into a wide price range starting at the
five-year-old Land Rover valued at around #5000 to the Land Rover
Discovery at #22,500, which was deemed by its owner to be ''too good for
field work''.
* BRUCE Gallacher drives an Isuzu Trooper LWB Citation on his boss's
1350-acre sheep farm at Castlehill, Durisdeermill, he said: ''The
Trooper was bought to replace two other vehicles. We had a pick-up and a
car but now the Trooper can be used as a family car and a farm vehicle
as it has enough power to pull a livestock trailer.
''The terrain on the farm is hilly and when the vehicle is taken off
the road it copes reasonably well, although ground clearance could be
better. The vehicle is regularly used to tow a one-ton trailer and can
transport four cows or 50 lambs comfortably.''
Last year the family travelled to Smithfield Show with a cargo of 24
Texel sheep: ''In the journey,'' said Bruce ''we got about 20 miles to
the gallon and even though we had a trailer in tow, bumps and bends were
levelled out.''
The journey home was made all the more comfortable for the Castlehill
lads after taking the top prizes with their sheep, the silverware added
to the load but the Trooper soldiered on regardless.
* WITH his father and brother, Robert Fry farms the 480-acre beef and
sheep unit at Porterstown, near Keir. His vehicle, a Land Rover 90
Turbo, has to cope with some tough ground.
''The terrain is rough and steep and the Land Rover is very good at
going up and down such hills no matter what the weather conditions,''
said Robert. ''It is grippy on wet ground and has good suspension,
riding the bumps well. When towing a loaded trailer it remains steady on
the road.''
His stock trailer takes about 60 lambs of 40 kilos each or five cows.
Robert concedes it is probably not as comfortable to drive on the road
as some. ''The gearbox and the steering are not as smooth as the Shogun
and it lacks in speed and handling on corners, however, when taken off
the road, the Land Rover is a different machine. It is far better than
anything else when crossing rough terrain and as a workhorse it performs
much better.''
Robert points out that the Land Rover has an aluminium body and is
rustproof. The vehicle can be hosed down, inside and out, and rubber
mats and leather seats make dirty boots welcome.
* NEXT door at Nether Keir, Brian Harvey and his father work a
330-acre dairy and sheep farm. Their vehicle is an eight-year-old
2.4-litre Toyota Hi-Lux which has to negotiate similar ground to the
neighbouring farm.
''We use the vehicle to go about the farm with feedstuff and when a
10ft trailer is attached it can transport around 40 lambs or four cows.
Off the road it has good traction but when the going gets tough we
prefer to use four-wheel motorbikes,'' said Brian.
On the road, Brian finds the driving position comfortable and the
vehicle well-balanced and good to handle. However, he notices a
difference when towing a loaded trailer: ''It is a bit slow and sluggish
and could well do with the bigger engine. But on the other hand its
reliability has been tremendous and in eight years all that we have
replaced, apart from tyres, is a battery and a fan belt.''
Toyota mania certainly has swept the family and seven Toyotas have
been in their ownership. But it is mum who gets the last word, it was
her skill in cartoon caption writing that won, in a sheep dip
competition, the Toyota Hi-Lux.
* FARMER'S son Derek Brown helps out at Dalveen, where 1700 sheep have
the freedom of its 3500 acres. Thomas Carlyle was once a visitor there
but that was long before the days of the Land Rover Discovery Turbo
Diesel 2.5 which at #22,500 is a fair price to pay to grace with dirty
wellies.
''It is a multi-purpose vehicle and it may be used on the farm or on
the road by the family,'' said Derek. ''It is in fact father's car.''
The Discovery is fitted with normal on/off tyres and because of this it
is not really equipped for rough or wet ground where good grip is vital.
''We have extremely steep hills on the farm and the quad bikes are the
only answer to get access to certain places. The use of the Discovery
off the road is kept to an absolute minimum.''
For comfort the machine comes into its own when towing a loaded
trailer and 50/60 lambs present no problems. ''It is a very capable and
stable vehicle and handles well, but to be extremely critical a little
bit more power could also come in handy,'' said Derek, whose experience
with other such vehicles is vast.
* JAMES Hewson shares his energies as chairman of Dumfries Young
Farmers where he has been known to offer his body as a slave for a day
-- all in the interests of charity -- to helping his father at Drumcork,
a 650-acre dairy and mixed farm near Thornhill. His vehicle is a
two-year-old Daihatsu Fourtrak TDL.
''The vehicle is mainly used on the farm but occasionally when we are
transporting a small number of animals we tow a trailer,'' said James,
''but it is most important to match the correct trailer to the vehicle
otherwise 'swing' will be experienced. This is our third Daihatsu and we
have found it to have tremendous towing capacity. Its 2.8-litre engine
is adequate for the size of vehicle, but if anything it could do to have
a bit more weight itself.
''My main criticism about this vehicle is its leaf springs. If you go
over rough ground, through drains or hit a stone you may break a spring,
however, new vehicles have been fitted with coil springs which are much
better.''
But James is full of praise for his vehicle and maintains that it
represents great value for money at #13,500.

SWIMMING
HOPE springs eternal in Scottish swimming. Having both survived a
tough season, Richard Hope and his sister, Kirsty, are now poised to
figure among the leading challengers for Olympic selection next year.
The pair currently are training with the Scottish squad in Lyon and
will go on to compete in the Canadian national championships in Winnipeg
at the end of this month.
Richard also is on course for another glamour trip to the World
Student Games in Japan next month. He currently is ranked No.1 in the
100 metres and 200m back-stroke for a side that will be named after the
English national championships on July 23.
Despite the upheaval of moving from the City of Dundee Club to
Warrender -- he has just completed a first year in accountancy at
Edinburgh University -- he has managed to produce his best times, and
won the 200m back-stroke at last month's Scottish championships.
''I feel I've made a reasonable progression, although it has been
difficult trying to settle in at university,'' he said.
The Olympic Games in Atlanta next summer are his prime target, as it
is for Kirsty.
0 Meanwhile, the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association are to meet
Glasgow District Council in the near future with the hope of resolving
the branding problems which caused the sponsorship furore at last week's
Scottish age-group championships at the Scotstoun Pool.
Chris Reed, managing director of sportswear firm Hind, withdrew the
company's backing of all Scottish events because of the lack of
advertising within the pool area.

Rover's good-looking 600 series is ready to compete on everything from
performance to price, says James Currie
ONE of the many reasons for BMW being so keen to buy Rover was that
the British company has in its portfolio several technically advanced
cars that are nowhere near the end of their shelf-life.
Apart from the Mini, which will exit the stage next year, and the
creaking 800 series, virtually everything else is right up to date. And
arguably the most attractive of these is the Rover 600.
The result of many years of work incorporating the best of British and
Japanese engineering, the 600 not only outshines the rest of the
''junior executive'' cars when it comes to styling, it has earned itself
a deserved reputation as a quick, safe, reliable and easy to drive car
at a reasonable price.
Although Rover sold almost 25,000 examples of the 600 last year it
retains an air of exclusivity. More than four times as many Ford Mondeos
found new homes in the same period. Three times as many Cavaliers and
twice as many Peugeot 405s were also snapped up, but this can be
explained away by the fact that the Rover, being better specified, is
just that little bit more expensive and this has been enough to keep it
out of the hands of reps on motorway duty.
From a purely fiscal point of view, Rover probably wouldn't mind if it
did become more popular. On the other hand, private buyers who prefer
both to stand apart from the herd and enjoy higher residuals will prefer
to enjoy the car's current niche status.
Of all the D-sector cars, the Rover stands squarely alongside the Audi
A4 and Mercedes-Benz C-class with regard to sheer driving pleasure. Its
current 2.0 and 2.5-litre engines are sophisticated units which provide
a nice balance between out and out performance (impressive) and an
ability to cruise quietly through town and country.
All models are understressed, so even with a full complement of
passengers and their luggage aboard there is ample power in reserve. Not
for 600 owners the frantic stirring of cogs every time the driving
situation changes slightly.
In this class of car the feel good factor is vitally important. Here
again Rover's packaging runs rings round anything else. The interior is
beautifully crafted, from the carefully sculpted seats to little touches
of polished wood veneer and bright chrome kickplates. New owner BMW,
oft-criticised for not providing more of the same in its German-built
cars, will no doubt adopt a few Rover ideas in future models, but until
then the 600 will remain the best-furnished car in its class.
Impressive as all this is, you can't sell cars on a pretty face alone.
All of the 600s I have sampled to date have provided excellent handling
characteristics together with a reassuring feeling of all-round
security. The steering is pin sharp and utterly predictable despite its
light feeling. None of the business of sweeping quickly into a corner
and then, after a couple of quick adjustments, having to wonder where
exactly the front wheels are pointing. Instinctively you just know the
balance is correct.
Similarly, the suspension is perfectly capable of soaking up the worst
B-road bumps without throwing the car off course. Witness too the
marginal body roll and the fact that all four tyres stay firmly planted
on the ground at all times, and it is apparent that Rover's engineers
are no slouches when it comes to dynamics and geometry. Part of this
handling ability can be explained by the car's low stance. Add a long
wheelbase and overall stability is assured.
Although legroom for rear seat passengers isn't as generous as in the
Ford Mondeo, those up front fare much better. There are also plenty of
storage places for maps, pens and mobile phones.
Fuel efficient cars, even the 2.5 litre can average 30 mpg while the
SDi diesel can wring 70 miles out of every gallon when driven properly.
That's enough to make any company accountants break into a smile.
Rover 600 prices start at #15,435 and peak when they reach #23,935.

FOR many years after they were first introduced to the UK market, the
idea of Japanese saloons and estates featuring in an executive cars
survey would have seemed ludicrous. To begin with, Japanese
manufacturers did not aspire to anything like these giddy heights, and
they made no effort to offer cars of the necessary size, price or
refinement.
As they have proved so often, however, Japanese companies eventually
move out from whatever tiny beachhead they establish in any of their
export markets. Several cars in their present portfolio are very clearly
aimed at the executive sector, and a number of them are highly rated for
excellent quality control, finish and sophisticated engineering. One
interesting feature is that they are quite dissimilar, offering very
different approaches in design.
Honda builds refinement into all its cars, and several of them figure
in any executive class list. The top-specification British-built Civic
five-door just edges into this sector since it is priced above #14,000,
a rough bottom-line figure for the class. Accord saloons from Swindon
and their non-alike counterpart Aerodeck estates built in the US take
Honda one step up, while the Japanese-built Legend is an elegant,
strongly performing V6 saloon with a definite rarity value here.
One move on alphabetically, the Lexus marque, created by Toyota to
move into an area of the market to which its own cars do not aspire,
offered right from the start a combination of hi-tech specification and
impeccable finish we had never before seen in Japanese saloons. The
four-litre LS400 is one of the finest saloons in the world, the
three-litre GS300 struggles more to find a logical place in the market,
and, if their styling makes them curiously anonymous, there are
customers for this class of car who regard merging into the background
as no bad thing.
Not, like Lexus, a separate make, but very much in a different league
from the other Mazda saloons, the Xedos 6 and 9 show that some Japanese
body designers are prepared to follow their own ideas. These
smooth-driving cars have definite retro features in their intriguing
lines. While the smaller version is more compact than it might be for a
two-litre, the 2.5-litre V6 Xedos 9, both in appearance and on the road,
is a car of notable refinement and style.
The giant Mitsubishi combine offers cars in many different classes
throughout the world, but it suffers more than most Japanese firms here
because of the quota restrictions. On the other hand, a slight
preponderance of demand over supply is no bad business situation. The
Galant is an accomplished mid-range saloon, not least because in
automatic form it introduced the ''fuzzy logic'' transmission which
rather spookily adjusts the way it works to the driver's own technique
at the wheel. Imported in small numbers, the Sigma saloon is crammed
with computerised systems, while the Australian-built Sigma estate does
without most of them, offering Outback-style space instead.
Top-level Nissan Primeras come into the executive choice sector, and
the latest examples continue the excellent road manners and handling
balance which have been with the Sunderland-built cars from the start.
While the Nissan Maxima never quite made the grade as a full-scale
executive car here, the very substantially revised version called the QX
shows that the company has no intention of giving up the battle without
a fight.
Most media coverage of Subarus concerns the rallying exploits of the
likes of Colin McRae in the Impreza Turbo. But the executive-class
Subaru is the road-going version of the model which was rallied by the
works-backed team before the Impreza appeared. The Legacy is an
impressive car which, as with most Subarus, goes its own sweet way in
terms of engineering and design. Its appearance is quite sober, but
there is an all-alloy flat-four engine under the bonnet, and all
versions, whether saloons or estates, come with four-wheel drive as
standard. The present cars are noticeably roomier than the pre-1994
models, and it is fair to say that many people who, for space, traction
and towing ability, have gone for a 4x4 would be just as well served by
a Legacy estate.
Under its own name, and away from the Lexus, Toyota has two models
which earn their place in the executive class, one of them perhaps only
at the top end of its price range, the other more wholeheartedly.
Although seen in several towns as part of the local taxi fleet, the
Carina offers passenger and luggage space to an extent that an executive
car user normally demands, while the CDX and Executive models have
equipment specifications to match. The 1.8-litre lean-burn engine offers
remarkable fuel economy at typical main-road cruising speeds. Once again
as a result of the quota restrictions, the Camry is a car which is seen
in quite small numbers here. In 2.2 and three-litre sizes, and
especially in the GX specification, it is a smooth and well equipped
saloon or estate, a stepping stone towards the ultimate refinement of
the Lexus.
While we still regard all these as ''Japanese cars'', they reach our
showrooms by many different routes, being built in factories not only in
Japan itself but also in Swindon, Sunderland, Derbyshire, Australia and
the US. Insistence on strict quality control, automation, trimmed-down
staff levels and often hair-raising standards of just-in-time component
supply help to counteract the effect on prices of the over-muscular yen.
And, of course, the cars manufactured in other countries do not have the
exchange-rate problems facing operations back home.
Japanese companies tend to persevere in any part of the market where
they have profitably established themselves. The signs are that they are
in the executive sector to stay.

RUGBY:
FRANCOIS Pienaar, who led South Africa to victory in the World Cup
final at Ellis Park a fortnight ago, has plunged Transvaal rugby into
crisis after he and some rebel players insisted on payment for playing.
Pienaar's demands were around #3000 net per match after medical
insurance, a disability fund, a further daily allowance to be paid on
top of match fees, and a transport allowance.
The Transvaal Rugby Executive said yesterday that they could not meet
the demands of the players, which would amount to approximately #2.5m a
season when spread over the 26-man squad, #100,000 per man per year, and
consequently the 13 rebel players -- 11 of them Springboks, including
Pienaar -- refused to turn up for training in Johannesburg yesterday
afternoon.
''We have a duty not only to the players involved,'' said Hans
Prinsloo, the chief executive of the Transvaal Rugby Union, ''but we
have a responsibility to all the rugby players in Transvaal.''
Pienaar and his fellow rebels are now forced into a difficult position
as they have been replaced for Transvaal's opening Currie Cup match on
Saturday.
As to whether the rebels can now play again for Transvaal, the chief
executive had an open mind.''These players have done a great deal, not
only for Transvaal rugby, but South African rugby in general. However,
Francois Pienaar must accept that his proposal is too expensive.''
England captain Will Carling, meanwhile, predicted that his England
squad would compete against South Africa in November as fully-fledged
professionals.

Everything was very gently grey. Sand, sea, sky. As far as the eye
could see there was this shimmering steeliness. And silhouetted against
it, two bodies, dancing. Slow, sculptural moves that looked so resolute
and calm as the wind that held the mizzle at bay tugged and slapped at
their clothes, their hair, their limbs.
And small, pearlescent waves hissed in the background while further
away, in the distance, headlong children and boisterous dogs yelped
blissfully at one another -- an ideal, impromptu soundtrack for an
utterly magical event.
Undoubtedly it would all have been different if the sun had shone --
more spectators for one thing. Different, but not better. For the
overcast tone of the day lent an air of romantic mystery to Incognita's
sudden appearance on the Portobello shoreline. (Today Dawn Hartley and
Brigid McCarthy -- who are Incognita -- pop up in the Scottish Portrait
Gallery at 2pm, tomorrow they are behind the Tourist Information Centre
near Waverley Station at noon.)
Each performance of Frontier -- as their duet is called -- will be
influenced by the space it's performed in. At the Gallery, for instance,
spectators will look down on the dancers, at the Information Centre they
will look up. At Portobello we gathered near the water and watched them
on the level.
Clad in simple slips -- black for Brigid, grey for Dawn -- they
stretched and balanced, toes rucking up the wet sand that subsequently
clung to them when they dropped to the ground, rolling and coiling as if
they themselves were part of the foam and the waves.
I'd previously seen this duet done in a studio. It was fascinating to
see just how differently the dancers moved when confronted by the
texture of the sand, the intervention of the breeze. What had previously
looked like a fine piece of abstract dance took on all kinds of mystical
resonances

Sara Villiers explains why Judi Dench is happy to be back in Scotland
where today she will receive a third honorary degree
DESPITE their professional flair actors are as prone to nerves as the
rest of us and Dame Judi Dench shares the sentiments of most of her
colleagues when she admits that she ''would rather die than make a
speech in public''. It is a fear which she has had to conquer more than
most, on the numerous occasions of accepting awards which have garlanded
a career as decorated as it is distinguished.
She's had to gulp and go for it twice this week already, addressing
Wimbledon Art College and opening a theatre named after her in Hull.
Today she receives a further distinction, when the Royal Scottish
Academy makes her a Doctor of Drama, the honorary degree joining the
Doctors of Letters she received from Warwick University in 1978 and the
University of York in 1983.
She declares herself overwhelmed at the honour but expresses relief
that she is not expected to speechify at this afternoon's ceremony, when
the RSAMD will also honour Dame Janet Baker with a Doctor of Music. The
occasion will be a relaxed and enjoyable one for Dench, witnessed by her
husband of 24 years, Michael Williams, and their 23-year-old actress
daughter, Fintry.
The fact that she has had no previous association with the Academy
makes her ''over-delighted'' with the doctorate, her pleasure
intensified by the fact that she and her family are committed
''Scotophiles''.
''We've been holidaying in Scotland for years now,'' she explains,
enthusing about the beauty of Mull, where the close-knit trio are
heading tonight. ''It will be our second visit this year, I just have
such a strong affinity with Scotland, although my roots are in Ireland.
I came here when I was very young and have been coming back ever
since.''
The RSAMD honorary degree joins an impressive roster of awards. In a
38-year career the 60-year-old actress has notched up a gong or two,
from an American Cable Entertainment ACE Award and a batch of Bafta Best
Actress statuettes, to the OBE in 1970 and the accolade of being made
Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1988.
Alongside such official approbation Dench has enjoyed the public's
affection. Like that other great theatrical dame, Peggy Ashcroft, she
has maintained an allegiance to the stage, with an outstanding body of
work which has earned her the respect of both critics and her peers --
the director Sir Peter Hall once declared she was ''the greatest speaker
of Shakespeare of her generation''.
However, it is televison roles which have given her a level of fame
uncommon to the typical classical actress. When Dench and Williams first
appeared in the London Weekend Television series A Fine Romance in 1980
they were amazed at the sackloads of fan mail they received. Dench was a
regular of the National Theatre and Williams a stalwart of the Royal
Shakespare Company; they were used to ovations and acclaim but had never
experienced such a scale of congratulations before.
The sit-com, exploring the up-and-down relationship of jaded lovers
Laura and Mike was an instant hit, running for three series and
propelling the couple to the heady heights of ''household name'' with
accompanying television offers. None the less Dench retained her
commitment to the stage, leading a quixotic professional life which at
times had her balancing playing Laura to appearing as Deborah in Harold
Pinter's A Kind of Alaska at the National Theatre.
She has said that she despises being pigeon-holed but there's little
chance of that with a career which has spanned playing the Virgin Mary
in the York mystery plays in 1957 to playing M in the forthcoming movie
Goldeneye. ''That makes me a Bond woman,'' she smiles, revealing that,
while the rest of the cast were filming in the exotic locations of St
Petersburg and Monte Carlo, her scenes were shot in an aerodrome in
Watford.
As a young graduate she sparked off her meteoric success with an
iridescent Ophelia at the Old Vic, confirming her potential with a
series of classical roles for the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 1987 she
was a stunning Cleopatra in Hall's production of Antony and Cleopatra,
in a performance which is considered a benchmark for the role.
Against advice she also played Sally Bowles in Cabaret in 1968 and
Lady Bracknell in The Importance of Being Earnest in 1982 and, against
expectations, triumphed in both. More recently she has starred in the TV
sit-com As Time Goes By and been absolutely fabulous in Rodney Ackland's
Absolute Hell, playing the glammed-up, sex-crazed hostess of a fifties
drinking den at the National.
How could such a woman be typecast? Playing the title role in Howard
Baker's production of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage in 1984 at the
Barbican she said: ''I think I'll sit on a stool at the Pit, all by
myself in the stage, wearing a fur coat and singing dirty songs. I'd
love that.''
Such mischievous musing is central to her appeal. A diminutive actress
-- five foot and one-and-a-half inches tall, although she likes to claim
five-foot two -- she has formidable presence, with the gravitas
necessary to command the classical roles but it is her warmth, humour,
and off-beat sexiness which explain her popularity with the public.
She has the face of a minx, and even that grim glare she does to
perfection -- ''perhaps I can do it with just a look'' she used to
suggest to Bob Larley, writer of A Fine Romance, enabling him to pare
lines from the script -- itches with supressed humour. Such spikiness is
refreshing, and while many are drawn to her approachable persona, her
sly self-deprecations are infinitely more interesting.
While she'll happily enthuse over her eighteenth-century Hampstead
cottage and her love of tapestry she also likes to poke fun at her
homely image. She once detailed housewifely chores to an interviewer
which included washing the rabbit, only to laugh and then confess that
any notion of a domestic Judi was tosh.
And as long as she's pulling surprises and rabbits like that out of
the bag she'll continue to be the most delicious dame the empire has
known.

ONE of two Scots bowlers sent home in disgrace from a tournament in
Wales after an alleged late-night binge claims the Scottish Bowling
Association got the wrong man.
Mr David Miller, from Cumbernauld, has demanded an apology from the
SBA, which ordered him home on Tuesday after ruling that he broke a
midnight curfew hours before Scotland played England in the first round
of the home international championship.
Mr Miller says he is innocent and will now ''go for the jugular'' to
clear his name.
Mr Miller, 27, was accused, along with Mr Hugh Duff, 32, of breaking
the curfew imposed by team manager Mr Gordon Neil while staying at the
Straddy Park Hotel, Llanelli. The pair now face a ban of up to three
years from the Scottish squad.
Mr Bob Colthard, Scottish Bowling Association president, said:
''Players were told to be in their rooms by midnight on Sunday. It
transpires that Duff and Miller both reappeared in the hotel bar around
1am and continued drinking for some time.''
Mr Neil said he was bitterly disappointed at the action of the two
players and ''given the circumstances had no alternative'' but to send
them home.
Mr Duff admitted he had breached a code of conduct but felt his action
did not warrant such a severe sanction.
He said he had gone downstairs after midnight to telephone his
girlfriend but, while waiting for someone to finish a call, had joined a
friend for a drink in the hotel lounge.
''There is no way I was even drunk,'' he said. ''When I go out to play
for Scotland I give 150% and would never do anything to jeopardise my
chances.''
Mr Duff had returned to the Scottish squad after a five-year absence
and was regarded by most observers as a sure selection for the world
championships in Adelaide, Australia, later this year. Mr Miller's
chances were less clear cut.
Last night Mr Miller said: ''I am taking further action to clear my
name and have already spoken to a number of people who are willing to
sign statements to say I was not in the bar after midnight.
''I intend to go for the jugular on this and demand a public apology.
If I never play for Scotland again outdoors it doesn't matter as long as
I clear my name.''
Mr Miller can already rely on Mr Duff to support his claim. His friend
said: ''David wasn't with me and wasn't in the bar. I admit I made a
mistake but I am really angry for David, who is totally innocent.''
The case will be discussed by the SBA at its next council meeting
later this month, when further disciplinary action could be taken.
In 1987 Ayrshire bowler John Fullarton was suspended for three years
after being sent home from a Scottish indoor match in Aberdeen for
drunken behaviour.

GEORGE HUME writes of an Edinburgh student's European cycling trek to
raise funds for diabetes research
STUART Davis keyed into cyberspace and surfed the internet to go
cycling -- 4508 miles from the North Cape to Santander in Spain. When
you are planning that kind of mileage and expect to have three punctures
en route, it is as well to have someone else along for the ride. Where
better for an Edinburgh student to look for a cycling companion than the
rest of the world.
The biggest problem of the journey for the 24-year-old computer
science student from Heriot-Watt University is keeping his insulin cool.
A diabetic from boyhood Davis must inject four times a day. The trip,
undertaken as a sponsored ride, is being made to raise money for
diabetic research -- the target #10,000.
As a result of his global search for a cycling companion, Davis is now
pushing hard for his 88-mile-a-day average in the company of Garth Coco,
also aged 24, who gave up his job with Australia's Department of Defence
and flew across the world from his home in Melbourne.
''The disappointing thing is that no-one in Britain was interested in
coming. There was a good response worldwide -- interest from Klaus in
Munich, Trevor in Cape Town, Chris in Massachussets -- but no enthusiasm
from anyone here,'' says Davis who completed a daily dawn training stint
in the nearby Pentland Hills in preparation for the trek.
The reluctant are missing the two-wheeled equivalent of the Grand
Tour, 49 days of riding and 22 of rest between the most northerly point
in Europe, North Cape, right down to the Spanish port of Santander
taking in, en route, the length of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany,
Austria, Italy and France.
The cyclists have no back-up on the tour, relying on tried and tested
machines, a comprehensive tool kit and expertise gained by Davis during
cycling tours in the Pyrenees and over the Alps. Fresh supplies of
insulin will be handed over by Davis's parents when they meet
''somewhere in Europe''.
According to Davis: ''The thing that most people think of as a problem
when you tell them about a route like this, punctures, are surprisingly
rare. From past experience you can go for 1500 miles without a flat . .
. that's three on the whole tour. But I do foresee problems keeping my
insulin cool on the southern part of the route.''
The British Diabetic Association will benefit from the sponsorship
money raised on Davis's tour. ''I was 10 when it was discovered that I
was diabetic -- Christmas Day, in fact, was when I went into a coma
after all the sugary drinks I had taken. I have no problems with the
cycling side of things, and this will be the highlight on my 'things I
have done that a diabetic shouldn't' list.''
The trip started on Monday, the first day run from Honningsvad and
Russenes knocking 91 miles from the total -- just 4417 miles to go. The
pair will ride through the Fjords, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Stuttgart,
Innsbruck and Venice, Montpellier, Andora and Santander -- scheduled for
September 11. And after that? ''Home on the 11am ferry.''

A FRIEND said that Alexander Langer, co-chairman of the Greens group
in the European Parliament who committed suicide in Florence, was
devastated by the war in Bosnia.
Police confirmed that Langer, 49, died of suffocation after hanging
himself from a tree.
His friend and colleague Adriano Sofri said: ''He was devastated by
the tragedy of Bosnia, he threw himself into it with all his energies.
He felt very isolated in his battle.''
A suicide note to Langer's wife Valeria was found on his body. It
said: ''Forgive me for all this . . . The burdens on my shoulders have
become truly unbearable, I can't carry on.''

Vitamins and minerals are vital to a healthy body, and as Ann Shaw
discovers, even small doses can prevent strokes and help maintain a
beautiful skin
YOU may have noticed, tucked away in the medical press last week, a
news item stating that half an orange a day reduces the risk of strokes
in elderly people.
This study, carried out on 1000 people between the ages of 65 and 96
at Southampton University, revealed that the risk of a stroke was twice
as high for people with a low vitamin C intake. Even half an orange a
day (or 28mg) reduces the risk. Researchers believe the antioxidant, or
scavenging, effect of vitamin C protects against furring up of the
arteries.
Of course, this adds further weight to the ongoing debate of vitamins
and high-dosage vitamin supplements in our diet.
Should we take them? Should we pop a pill or eat fresh fruit and
vegetables? Clearly the latter is the obvious and most sensible choice.
But it seems a lot of us are not convinced. Either we do not have the
time to eat the required minimum of five portions of fresh fruit and
vegetables a day, or we think it's quicker to swallow a dose of pills.
Whatever the reason we are gulping down #250m a year of vitamins and
mineral supplements.
Added to this is a new development: a number of cosmetic companies,
such as Estee Lauder and Elizabeth Arden, are putting them into
cosmetics and charging a hefty price for them.
Do they work? Are we wasting our money buying creams and lotions
stuffed with vitamins and minerals? This is not a route nutritionists
would recommend, says an expert from Glasgow University Department of
Human Nutrition, stating that the amount of nutrients to be gained from
this method is small.
This is a view confirmed by Patrick Holford, director of the Institute
of Optimum Nutrition: ''Vitamins applied transdermally in cosmetic
creams cannot penetrate the skin to the depth where they're really
needed.''
If you want shiny hair, strong nails and a clear skin the best
solution is to look at your diet. Here you will discover the best beauty
products don't come wrapped in expensive packaging.
In fact the two most important nutrients are free and often
overlooked: fresh air and water.
Dr Richard Passwater, author of The Super Nutrition, Pocket Books,
paperback) says: ''The single most important nutrient for a beautiful
skin is water. Your daily diet should include the equivalent of six to
eight 8oz glasses of water. The nutrient of next greatest importance is
fibre.''
Vitamin A, along with the mineral zinc, is also important.
''Unsaturated fatty acids such as EPA are critical for supple young
skin. Pet owners have seen the difference in the skin and hair that
adding such oils to their pet's diet makes,'' he added.
Improving nutrition isn't the only thing we can do to boost our health
and looks. Regular aerobic exercise not only improves our skin but has
the bonus of adding another seven years to our lifespan, according to
researchers Dr Rose and Dr Cohen of the Veterans Administration Hospital
in Boston.
''Your skin is a mirror for your diet,'' says Holford. ''Although some
people appear to have a good skin whatever they eat, ultimately you
cannot maintain good skin and a youthful body without good nutrition.
This slows down the ageing process, maintains skin suppleness, and tone
and decreases spots. Beauty comes from the inside.''
The skin itself is made out of cells. Within a month you effectively
replace your entire skin with new cells.
A healthy diet and avoiding direct sunlight are the two best ways of
ensuring a beautiful skin. But you can boost this by making certain you
get an adequate supply of vitamins A, C and E, the anti-oxidants that
protect you. One fresh carrot and an orange a day goes some way to
fulfilling this requirement. Garlic is a well-known mild natural
antibiotic and also improves circulation which keeps the skin clear and
healthy. Eat it raw or in tablet form.
Evening Primrose Oil is a rich source of essential fatty acids. Eczema
sufferers can get it prescribed for them on the NHS now that doctors
have finally acknowledged its usefulness. Fish oil capsules fulfil a
similar function, and those suffering from arthritis and heart disease
particularly find them helpful.
Of course, you can play safe: eat both fresh fruit and vegetables plus
vitamin supplements.
It is with good reason that they say American women have the most
expensive urine in the world. Are we going the same way? Probably.

THE organisers of the Royal Highland Show missed a couple of handy
ways to reach Ingliston from their flier this year, and I thought that
it might be appropriate to flag them up for other events and the 1996
RHS onwards.
First, there is an excellent cycle path from South Queensferry to
Newbridge, which has a handy access just 50 yards from the West Gate. In
1994, cycling away, we must have passed over 200 cars by the time we
reached Kirkliston.
A similar but less pleasant option is to cycle from South Gyle using
the designated paths beside the A8, but on these you do suffer the smell
and noise of queueing traffic, not the blossom and birdsong on the
disused railway.
Now all the RHS needs to provide is some cycle parking.
Then this year I tried out the Citylink bus service -- #5 for a day
return to Ingliston from Glasgow with a 40-50 minute journey time almost
to the door and the ability to read or rest while someone else does the
driving.
The pick-up points at Harthill, with its ample parking space, could be
quite attractive to those coming from Lanarkshire and West Lothian, and
other services running from Livingston, Linlithgow, Bathgate, and
Stirling all offer alternative stress free, low cost journeys to the
show especially if the peak-hour services are avoided.
Much lip-service is paid to promotion of sustainable transport, and
all too often events and venues are publicised with the sole directions
''from the motorway''.

* DOES a high intake of vitamin C reduce the severity of a cold? New
research from the University of Helsinki suggests it does. It found that
high intakes will reduce both the length and severity of a cold by as
much as 23%. Most studies used one gram daily which resulted in an
average of 19% decrease in severity. But in cases where a higher two to
four gramme dosage was used there was a 29% reduction in the severity of
the cold.
And a report in Monitor, the doctors' weekly magazine, says that those
countries with a high incidence of heart disease such as Scotland,
Northern Ireland and Finland also have a much lower consumption of food
containing Vitamin E and C which comes mostly from olive oil, cereal
oils and citrus fruits.
They suggest that the low levels of these anti-oxidants in the blood
of cigarette smokers may also explain the relationship between smoking
and heart disease.

THE industrialist in today's competitive trading conditions requires
not only expert guidance in the accounting and legal fields but also
skilled advice in relation to physical assets.
It is now well recognised that property, whether buildings, land or
plant and machinery, has a strategic significance and that it pays to
optimise its contribution to overall financial performance. For many
companies, equipment assets can constitute the majority of the value
reported in the accounts and the need to apply sophisticated asset
management techniques to them is becoming more widely acknowledged.
Increasingly they are turning to the small group of qualified property
professionals who specialise in the area of machinery and equipment
advice.
There is an enormous range of plant and machinery employed by industry
and commerce, and an almost equal variety of reasons why people need the
advice of a specialist valuer. Instructions are received from
industrialists, institutions such as banks and insurance companies and
professional advisors including accountants, management consultants and
insurance brokers. There is no typical client -- it is as likely to be a
small provincial printing works as a multi-national conglomerate.
The basis of the value of machinery and equipment depends largely on
the use to which the valuation is to be put. The value to the business
of a group of assets assumes they are to remain as part of an
undertaking which is expected to operate for the foreseeable future.
While this may be acceptable for a company balance sheet or for internal
management purposes, it would not be appropriate for a liquidator
seeking to dispose of assets at very short notice, nor would it be
suitable for an assessment of the reinstatement value for insurance
purposes.
Advice can be sought for various reasons: an institution is lending
money for expansion and needs to know the value of the plant being used
as collateral; the factory owner wants to realise the maximum from the
disposal of surplus equipment; an insurance broker needs to advise a
client on the sum to be insured, or the potential purchaser of a
business requires an assessment of the true value of the fixed assets.
I head Fuller Peiser's plant and machinery department, and the scale
and breadth of the work of a specialist in this field can be shown by
the diversity of assignments we are involved in. For example, a current
instruction requires us to provide valuations for insurance and asset
purposes of the Tyne and Wear Metro light rail rapid transport network.
This 59km network includes 46 stations and the valuation covers track,
tunnel linings, the overhead power supply, signalling and control
systems, underground and surface stations, the running and maintenance
depot, the control centre and the major civil structures.
Another example is an American conglomerate which has instructed us to
value, and prepare a disposal programme for, a surplus production
facility in the UK. The complex runs to more than 650,000 sq ft of
buildings on some 60 acres. We are also acting for a data processing
company, assessing the value of a concern it is acquiring from a public
department, including entering negotiations with the vendor's agents.
Earlier this year we were awarded an 18-month contract to act as
auctioneer for the Ministry of Defence for the disposal of its surplus
stores and equipment in Scotland and Northern England. Six auctions are
planned for this year, the next at the end of July. They will comprise
items as diverse as submarine spares and messroom silverware from depots
such as Rosyth, Stirling, Carlisle and Catterick.
It is unusual to find a business that has not undergone restructuring
over the past few years and in many cases these changes have rendered
existing asset registers at the very least deceptive. An inventory
prepared by plant and machinery valuers can satisfy a requirement for a
register, whether this is for internal or external audit, engineering,
product costing or maintenance reasons.
Moreover, the independent nature of the exercise can obviate potential
internal administrative problems. The computer systems produced by
property consultants for the presentation and processing of plant and
machinery data have been a key element in the attraction of this
service.
For more than 100 years surveyors have been active in this field and
have built up an unrivalled expertise. As a result, plant and machinery
valuers are called upon to act not only in Britain but throughout the
world, be it for an oil company in Libya or a textile manufacturer in
Canada.

JAGUAR, the ''big cat'' of the British motor industry, has clawed its
way back to the forefront of the executive car park from virtual
extinction 10 years ago. Then, poor build quality, indifferent design
and dodgy components earned the XJ range the unwelcome title of the
hard-shoulder car, due to the number of times it broke down.
Today, under Ford ownership and tighter build control, with a design
that combines modern lines with a touch of the past, the XJ range is
once again in big demand.
Having got it right with the latest XJ, launched in the Highlands last
autumn, Jaguar has cleverly extended the range. The original line-up has
now been joined by the XJ6 3.2S aimed directly at the younger driver,
while the XJ6 Gold with its luxury specification will appeal to the
traditional Jaguar fancier.
Riding high on the back of new confidence and sales records around the
globe, it has also added a stretched version of the XJ saloon. Growing
by five inches, the stretched cat provides significantly improved rear
passenger comfort and space to satisfy equally the needs of
chauffeur-driven company executives and growing families.
The long wheelbase becomes a standard fitment on the flagship Daimler
Six and Double Six saloons, and as a cost option on Jaguar XJ6,
Sovereign and XJ12 models, with prices running from #32,200 for the
Jaguar XJ6 3.2 to #65,950 in the case of the Daimler Double Six.
The stretched cars are launched at a time of booming demand for the XJ
series. Jaguar sales in more than 60 markets worldwide are running at a
five-year high, with impressive gains in the US, Japan, Europe, the
Middle East and Latin America. Record-breaking sales in major export
markets boosted the company's figures to 3718 cars in May, an increase
in business of 47.4%. But some of the biggest gains came from nearer
home, with UK buyers boosting business by 57%.
Having rediscovered its considerable bite in the executive car sector,
Jaguar is re-introducing the 24-valve four-litre engine option due to
British customer demand. Available from August 1 on both short and long
wheelbase models, the silky smooth four-litre pushes out 245bhp of
power. Jaguar's chairman and chief executive Nick Scheele claims: ''The
new XJ series has been a major success in all our markets around the
world.''
Earlier this year the XJ12 was voted the most beautiful luxury saloon
car in the world, against fierce international competition. The
recognition came from an illustrious Italian judging panel in Milan.
Experts in the world of visual arts, they found the style of the new
Jaguar recreated ''the classic allure of a British flagship''.
Jaguar's director of sales and marketing, Roger Putnam, says: ''The
sculpted new bodyshell evokes a powerful sense of Jaguar style and
pedigree. As importantly, however, the new XJ series is designed and
built to the highest standards of quality and backed by comprehensive
warranties, ensuring complete peace of mind for the customer.
''Combined with Jaguar's traditional value for money, the new XJ
convincingly provides both emotional and rational reasons to purchase.''
A month after winning the top award for style, Jaguar was recognised
for its security measures on the new car. The XJ series saloon took the
coveted 1995 British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association Anti-Theft
Award.
Due to celebrate its sixtieth anniversary in September, the success of
the new XJ series saloon is a fitting milestone for the company founded
by Sir William Lyons.

THE year started with encouraging news particularly on the industrial
front. The City of Dundee District Council's Claverhouse Park continues
to attract companies looking to modernise their businesses through
relocation to more suitable new property.
For example, Van Leer is moving out of its post-war factory at
Camperdown, forming a new company, Tay Flexible Packaging, to lease the
30,000 sq ft Carmichael Building, which is also being extended for it.
Another company which has moved out of post-war space, this time on
Dunsinane, is Samuel Bruce. It has taken the 22,000 sq ft Watson Watt
Building.
Over on West Pitkerro, we have sold a 16,500 sq ft factory for the
expansion of D&amp;V Supplies, a pet products distributor. Bonspiel
Engineering has doubled its factory space in the city by leasing a 4000
sq ft unit from JW Muir Property Investments. Top Hat Foods has extended
its existing factory by some 13,750 sq ft to satisfy increasing demand
for its products. United Artists is to move from its former jute mill
premises on Brown Street to take about 16,000 sq ft from the District
Council close to the new 20,000 sq ft Ravensby glass factory.
Schlumberger's new facility totalling some 80,000 sq ft is also nearing
completion.
All this activity on West Pitkerro has brought interest from
developers and Scottish Metropolitan Property has drawn up plans for a
five-acre site fronting Arbroath Road. Enquiries are invited from
prospective purchasers/tenants. For immediate occupation, however, we
have a range of workshop units from 750 sq ft to 2000 sq ft on Barlow
Park, fronting West Pitkerro, opposite the Michelin tyre factory.
In the Technology Park, negotiations are underway with a local company
in respect of the 40,000 sq ft building next to General Accident.
Liverpool and Victoria has leased 2500 sq ft next to ScottishPower in
Building Five. Building Two of 10,000 sq ft is currently under offer to
a property investment company. Meanwhile, another floor has been let in
the Delta Centre, this time to Lambda Automotive, which is pioneering
new diagnostic equipment for the car industry. Other recent lettings
include further expansion by DMA Design which has taken a 5000 sq ft
unit next to its existing premises in Discovery House.
In the city centre, National Westminster Bank has signed up for ground
and first floor space in No 1 Courthouse Square, an office refurbishment
involving Scottish Enterprise Tayside. The bank's decision to choose
this building highlights the quality of the accommodation provided and
its excellent location. Keen interest is expected in the remainder of No
1 Courthouse Square.
The Bank of Scotland's new regional headquarters is also making its
imposing mark as construction continues apace on the corner of
Nethergate/Marketgait.
Work gets underway this summer on the #4m phased refurbishment of the
Overgate Shopping Centre and, following a break over the Christmas
trading period, is scheduled for completion next summer. The scheme by
owner Molyneux Estates will bring the Overgate, which was the first
shopping centre of its type in Scotland, into the nineties and help
maintain the shopping balance between the east and west of the city
centre. A number of leases for empty shop units are currently being
negotiated and increased competition for the remaining few is
anticipated.
Round in Bank Street, the ground floor of the former Courier Buildings
has been converted into five new shops. One has already been let one to
a hairdresser and two further units are under offer.
Another exciting project in prospect is the redevelopment of the
former Gaumont cinema opposite the Wellgate Shopping Centre, most
recently occupied by County Bingo. Originally known as the King's
Theatre, locally based developer Michael Johnston has purchased the
property and is considering plans for a prestigious scheme.

Perth
PERTH has been much in the headlines recently due to the SNP's victory
in a parliamentary by-election which saw a wide range of colourful, not
to say lunatic policies (referring of course to Screaming Lord Sutch,
not the Government) being aired.
It has been voted to have the best quality of life in the UK and is a
city which thrives on statistics. Some 18% of all new cars in Scotland
are sold on Dunkeld Road, Perth's ''motor mile''; 41% of the working
population in Perth and Kinross are in banking or finance; Perth
residents have the highest per capita bank balance in Scotland. And, of
course, it lies geographically at the heart of Scotland, less than 90
minutes from 90% of the population.
All this generates a local confidence and optimism in the face of the
UK recession. Moreover, the city, with its traditional base of
professional jobs through employers such as General Accident, United
Distillers and Hydro-Electric, together with excellent communication
facilities and increasing entrepreneurial interest in property, is well
placed to attract a wide range of high calibre occupiers.
Although it has not been totally immune to the recession, and there is
still the occasional letting board on city centre shops, there is no
significant over-supply in the High Street or secondary areas. While it
is clear demand is not over-strong as yet, several retail requirements
remain unsatisfied due principally to a lack of suitable opportunities.
Only one unit remains in the Prudential's successful retail park, and
further development opportunities would seem to be limited due to
planning restrictions. This is illustrated by the recent refusal of
planning permission for a food retail development at the former
Dickson's Garage site on Dunkeld Road.
There is no significant over-supply of office space, with very few
quality suites or buildings available in the traditional Georgian
townhouses favoured by professional firms. What vacant office
accommodation there is in the centre has failed to find tenants due more
to the quality or arrangement of space, or other factors such as lack of
car parking, than shortage of occupier demand. Supporting this, there
are several recent examples of quality office suites and buildings
attracting tenants as soon as they became available.
The principal development on the office market at present is the
Glasgow Road business park, where Scottish Enterprise Tayside has made
fully serviced sites available. The first building, Robertson House, is
now nearing completion, with 50% of its 10,000 sq ft under offer -- an
encouraging sign. A second building is due to be started within the next
few weeks, a clear indication of confidence in tenant demand provided
the right space is made available.
The next major development proposed for the city is the business park
at Broxden on Glasgow Road, which recently received outline consent for
a 100-acre site intended for high-quality pavilion-style office
buildings and larger headquarters-type developments. Opportunities
presented here will play a major role in attracting prestige occupiers
to Perth.
Consent has also just been granted for a prominent site overlooking
the River Tay within the city centre for a 9000 sq ft office development
together with 42 flats. Part of this has already been pre-let to the
procurator fiscal's office.
The local industrial property market is characterised by the almost
complete lack of speculative development, apart from one or two schemes
at North Muirton and Friarton near the harbour. Very few serviced plots
remain undeveloped at Inveralmond, the main industrial estate, which
presently consists mostly of purpose-built and owner-occupied premises.
However, it is understood this may be extended in the near future, a
move considered essential to retain the city's industrial base.
One unknown hanging over the market is the imminent reloction of a
major portion of Hydro-Electric's activities in the city to the former
Dewars bottling plant at Inveralmond. This may result in a number of
office and industrial buildings throughout the city becoming available
simultaneously.
A number of other factors cannot be disregarded when assessing the
future of the Perth commercial market. First, the city was badly hit by
floods in 1993 when a large portion of the centre and Friarton and North
Muirton industrial estates were under water. This threat is now being
addressed by the authorities through a #16m flood protection scheme.
Second, there is the airport question. At present, there are limited
facilities at both Dundee and Perth, and a full-scale airport is
regarded as necessary for the future development of the whole region.
How this situation will be resolved is as yet unclear, but an expanded
Perth airport with commercial facilities would have a major impact on
both the city and local property markets.
Third, there has been much discussion of the city's traffic problems
and the need for another bridge over the Tay. Should this happen, there
will be considerable benefit to the centre, and a whole range of new
developmnt opportunities will be opened up.
Finally, there is local government reorganisation. This has to be
considered both from the point of view of the new authorities'
operational requirements, and the general effect of the likely influx of
increased local authority personnel.
Overall, the city's commercial market reflects a welcome note of
optimism, and mirrors the belief that a set of already impressive
statistics can be improved still further in the future.

WHEN you consider that the average family car routinely transports
human beings at speeds maybe four or five times faster than they could
possibly manage under their own steam, its constantly maligned safety
record actually turns out to be rather impressive.
To understand why this is, you have to divide safety into two groups,
active and passive. Passive safety, the one that gets all the publicity,
is what keeps you alive when the car crashes, while active safety is the
car's disinclination to crash in the first place.
You hear a lot about passive safety because it is easy to understand,
which means manufacturers can use it to entice people into buying their
cars. That is why there is so much talk about airbags and doorbars, for
example, though I have yet to be convinced by the latter. If something
hits the door, surely the bars (which are not attached to anything else)
are going to come in with it. Volvo's side-impact protection system,
which spreads the force of an accident throughout the car, sounds much
more sensible.
Seat belts, of course, represent one of the earliest forms of passive
safety, but the universal lap-and-diagonal layout is long overdue for a
rethink. An adaptation of the full harness with aircraft buckle, widely
used in motorsport, would be preferable. It offers vastly superior
protection during an accident, and is much easier to get out of.
However, you can load a car with protection devices until you are blue
in the face, but it would be much better not to have accidents at all.
And not having accidents is something today's cars are, on the whole,
very good at, thanks to decades of development.
Cars become dangerous when you drive them at their limit, so it makes
a lot of sense to set this higher than the average driver can ever
reach. One problem, though, is that nobody involved with car safety has
any control over the person behind the wheel, who is the root cause of
100% of motoring accidents. Perhaps this is because safety standards
have reached such heights that car owners feel no harm can possibly come
to them, and drive accordingly.
That was in the mind of an engineer who said he wanted to see
legislation introduced so that every new car would leave the factory
with a large metal spike fitted to the centre of the steering wheel,
aimed at the driver's chest. His theory was that this would make
everyone drive much more carefully, cutting the accident rate to zero.
It might work too.

<HEADLINE>Lords reject new curbs on beating Scottish children</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977535128</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government has rebuffed calls for specific protection for Scottish
children against being beaten with sticks, belts, or other objects.
A cross-party move to amend the Children (Scotland) Bill in the Lords
was defeated by 128 votes to 87, a Government majority of 41, during the
report stage.
The legislation defines the responsibilities and rights of parents and
promotes the welfare of children.
The cross-party amendment would have introduced curbs to prevent
children being hit with objects such as sticks or belts and being struck
or shaken ''in any way to cause or risk causing injury of more than
momentary pain or discomfort''.
Proposing the change, Lord Henderson of Brompton (Ind) told the House
that children were not sufficiently protected from violence in the home.
He said he wanted to see a ''change in the culture of violence in the
homes of the country''. He reminded peers they had initiated the ban on
corporal punishment in schools, changing the culture of violence in
schools.
The Earl of Lindsay, for the Government, insisted sufficient
protection against assault was offered in statutory and common law. He
warned the proposed curbs would impair the ability of the courts to take
all the circumstances of a case into consideration.
The unsuccessful move to change the Bill in the Lords followed a
similar proposed amendment during the Bill's passage through the
Commons, which was also defeated.
Supporting the Lords amendment, Labour's Baroness David said she would
prefer to see a total ban on all punishment but the amendment was a
''modest measure'' which would send out a signal it was ''not on'' to
hit children with implements that risked causing injury or prolonged
pain.
Lord Macaulay of Bragar, for Labour, said the amendment ''struck the
right balance'' by leaving the common law of assault unchanged but
bringing the question of violence into the Bill. ''This is a message
being sent out through the legislation to parents that they cannot abuse
their children in any way.''
Lady Kinloss (Ind) said Childline Scotland had reported a high
proportion of children calling it said physical punishment was their
''main problem''. The vast majority said they ''just wanted the hurt to
stop but they did not want their families to split''.
However, the Earl of Balfour, a Tory, deplored what he said was a move
to take away physical punishment as a means of disciplining children. He
insisted ''responsible parents'' had to be able to stop children who
were deliberately disobeying them.
Lord Lindsay said cases cited by the Crown Office showed all the
circumstances in cases of violence against children were taken into
account by the courts.
''It is the reasonableness of the punishment, rather than whether an
implement has been used, which is the key in their determination,'' he
stressed. ''The law as it stands, both statutory and common law, is
sufficient to protect children from assault by parents, teachers, or
others in charge of children.''

<FLAG>JAZZ FESTIVAL 1995</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>977535129</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TRIBUTES to the jazz greats can produce little more than sterile
festival programme-filling fodder. They do sometimes take a trick with
an audience, however, and it gladdened the heart to see a near-capacity
turnout appreciate a man whose previous Scottish appearances have often
gone unnoticed.
Step forward Peter King, one of the few musicians capable of paying
homage to Charlie Parker. ''Bird'' may have died 40 years ago but his
huge influence on jazz remains undiminished. Rather than simply
regurgitate Parkerisms, King has retained his spirit and keeps moving
with it. He also doesn't simply cope with bebop's furious tempos, he
injects feeling into them, smearing his way through melodies with a
lovely sweet alto saxophone tone.
To his quintet here was added another altoist of the Parker
persuasion, Phil Woods, slightly more sour of tone but capable of
creating something fresh out of the oft-remoulded Loverman. When he,
King, and trumpeter Gerard Presencer got together on Koko, they formed a
horn section so tight and exciting it made a mockery of their brief
rehearsal time.
Despite being the youngest man on stage and in hot company, Presencer
easily held his own. A marvellous ballad on trumpet and a beautiful
flugelhorn solo on Parker's fast but reflective Confirmation were
stand-outs among his consistently impressive contributions.

MUCH has been written, and no doubt more will follow, about the state
of the property industry and, in particular, of commercial surveying
practices. We all know there has been a recession and what effect it has
had and, although some may not like to admit it, the storm clouds have
not yet passed over. What is uncertain at the moment, in this fast
changing industry, is how many surveying practices will survive in their
present form, if they survive at all.
During the past few years there has been a rash of mergers and
acquisitions within the profession in what seems to be a headlong rush
to join, or become, a national or even international practice. The
rationale behind these moves appears to be a perception that practices
have to be extremely large if they are to survive. An alternative
philosophy, which is perhaps just as popular, holds that businesses
should be small niche operators concentrating on one market sector.
If it is true that only large national or niche practices will
survive, one might question why James Barr &amp; Son has chosen to become an
independent business, having been part of a large national practice for
the past six years, but at the same time not falling into the category
of niche operator. To understand this we have to go back to the good old
days -- 1988 to be precise -- when we merged with Herring Son &amp; Daw.
The idea was to give both firms a wider geographical presence
throughout the UK, providing largely the same services as before and
benefiting from the many cross-selling opportunities which would be
identified. To a certain extent we were successful in securing
additional business in the short term and expansion opportunities were
taken on the back of increased resources and a wider client base.
As time passed, however, and further mergers and acquisitions took
place in, for example, Manchester, Bristol and Cambridge, the benefits
diminished and the problems increased. Of course, some of the expansion
coincided with the downturn of the property market and it is easy to lay
blame at that door for many of the ills subsequently experienced.
What had made sense in 1988 no longer seemed to make sense in 1994. In
our experience the perceived benefits of expansion through merger or
acquisition are difficult to achieve or maintain beyond an initial
period of enthusiasm. Trying to marry different backgrounds and cultures
is not easy and, in many instances, can be impossible -- particularly
where individual partners have been successful in their own right and
believe their way is the right one. The end result is disharmony and
dissatisfaction.
The view adopted by my colleagues and myself in May of last year, when
the management buy-out process was initiated, was that the benefits of
being part of a larger business had entirely disappeared and the costs
associated with this were unsustainable. These primarily related to
expensive non-fee earning central overheads which seemed to expand at a
greater rate than the business itself.
We have no regrets about the original merger as it has allowed us to
explore being part of a large organisation from the inside and
ultimately to decide on the preferred option for the future of our
business. Having had this experience, we can view mergers and
acquisitions from a different standpoint.
I may appear cynical when I say I don't believe in the perceived
benefits of expansion through merger or acquisition, but you don't have
to look very far for evidence to support my view. In some cases recent
acquisitions have been followed by the swift departure of key personnel
who presumably previously provided a worthwhile service to clients.
I would also question the term niche as adopted by some surveying
practices. It is often just a euphemistic exaggeration used to describe
a business previously called small. Furthermore, many of these
businesses were created as a result of redundancy from larger firms
rather than as a deliberate course of action to serve a particular
sector.
There are many examples of worthwhile businesses being created by
acquisition or merger and there are many good quality small practices,
but I simply don't believe you either have to be very big or very small
to survive the current market conditions.

AT about this time last year the market was buoyant, a spate of
frenzied buying having convinced most, if not all, observers that a more
orderly, predictable climate was at last in prospect. Property people
packed their bags and slipped off to the sun, confident and relaxed in
the belief that the recession was over, although this was not the case.
Twelve months on, there is a very different climate. Flavour of the
month, in many instances involving off the market negotiations, are
shopping centres, industrial estates and mixed portfolios. Investors, be
they institutions, property companies or private buyers all purchase
property as a means of securing capital growth, hopefully to show a
margin over interest rates and inflation.
However, many pension funds have become net investors in property due,
it appears, to the threat of a Parliamentary Bill which may change the
fiscal rules under which they can deal in property within the overall
investment portfolio. If pension funds are sellers, other investors are
not shy to seize the opportunity to buy a good quality product.
Deals of note this year so far include the purchase of Greenock town
centre by Prudential at #33m and Grosvenor Estate's re-acquisition of
Scottish Amicable's 75% top slice in the St John's Centre, Perth. The
startling yields seen last year for retail warehouse parks have
frightened off some funds but there is rumoured to be electrifying
rental evidence on new lettings at Hermiston Gait and Craigleith Park,
Edinburgh, allegedly breaking through the #20 per sq ft barrier on the
former.
The Strathclyde Region Structure Plan will limit the number of
prospective additional out-of-town retail parks in Glasgow, enhancing
values on the existing provisions as continuing growth in occupier
demand faces a limited supply. Prime yields hover around 7%.
On the industrial front, the new towns have been marketing their
estates in a relatively orderly disposal programme, Irvine and
Livingston selling substantial parcels, the former achieving close to
#25m for its million sq ft estate. Cumbernauld is expected to sell its
Grayshill Road and Westfield Estate in the autumn in a #10m package.
The prime retail market seems less assured than for many years.
Earlier this year, Scottish Widows withdrew its Buchanan Street
investment from the market unsold and AMP has just done the same with
its River Island unit on Argyle Street after bids failed to breach the
6% threshold. There is caution in the market about the effect of
proposed major retail developments at the Buchanan Centre and Braehead,
both suffering delays and setbacks despite assurances by the developers'
agents that a start on site is imminent.
There are two schools of thought on whether Glasgow genuinely needs
more unit shopping in the city centre. While most agents believe
Braehead is an ongoing threat and will ultimately happen, the viability
of the proposed schemes must be in question.
Meanwhile, a gap has opened up between best Princes Street at around
#155 zone A and best Argyle Street at about #122 (Birthdays letting).
The two streets have traditionally been much closer and it may not be
long before fresh evidence appears in Glasgow to convince investors that
bullish yields are justified and rental growth prospects are good
despite the threatened schemes which may not materialise.
The office investment market has been quiet, due to the relatively low
level of occupier demand. However, the supply of existing quality space
is drying up rapidly and already there is evidence of large-scale
development activity as Scottish Amicable has acquired Ashley House in
West George Street for a 77,000 sq ft new office development. British
Land has, meanwhile, agreed terms with Abbey National to develop the
former Scottish Mutual offices on St Vincent Street. The block bounded
by George Square and Ingram Street which used to house the head Post
Office for Glasgow is being marketed and proposals are invited. It could
accommodate up to 200,000 sq ft of new office space.
Prospective developments such as these can only strengthen the city
core for headquarters office use, while smaller schemes in progress will
serve the latest requirements of the professional community where
expansion or upgrading of space awaits economic recovery. Meanwhile,
over in Edinburgh, the Exchange District on Lothian Road has become the
epicentre for new office development. Cala Morrison has funded its
proposed 200,000 sq ft scheme with British Rail Pension Fund off a
reported ERV of #23 per sq ft.
On a bright note, four investors bid for the Church Commissioners'
Metro Centre in Gateshead recently but only one was successful at a
reported #340m. That leaves three large investors looking between them
to place #1000m and there are many smaller funds with live investment
requirements to fill. The Scottish market offers excellent prospects for
activity during the coming year, but as ever, buyers are very
discriminating.

Ross Finlay predicts the new Scorpio will be another best seller for
Ford
NO range of executive cars launched in recent years has been greeted
with such a stunned silence as the latest Ford Scorpio. Ford is
confident, or at least hopeful, that the poly-ellipsoidal headlights,
their lenses moulded to follow the body contours, will be accepted as
the shape of the future, because they offer excellent lighting
performance. However, some observers wonder if the front-end styling,
complete with oval radiator opening, can possibly catch on.
For a manufacturer sometimes regarded as the UK market leader because
it offers, in its mainstream models, lowest common denominator layout,
specification and styling, Ford does from time to time come up with
something conspicuously different.
The point about the Scorpio is that, through the years and earlier
using the Granada name, it has consistently been the market leader in UK
executive-car sales. Ford throws special equipment and trim at the
top-specification versions, while ensuring the prices remain
competitive. And it makes certain there is nothing at a similar price
which offers such almost limousine-like passenger space.
There are 13 Scorpio saloon models and the same number of estates.
Prices range from #16,995 to #27,455, and there are five possible engine
options -- an eight-valve two-litre, a 16-valve version of the same
unit, a 2.5-litre turbo diesel and a pair of Cosworth-built V6s with
either 150 or as much as 207bhp available.
In addition to that, there are three levels of trim and equipment:
Executive, Ghia and Ultima. But the list of options does not end even
there, because each of these levels comes with the extra-cost
possibility of added-equipment packs. Ford's latest anti-theft
immobiliser system is available, and one first-time option on any
European car is an interior mirror which not only dips automatically but
also varies the intensity of the image to cope with any outside
lighting.
The current Scorpio has a much enhanced fascia design, runs more
quietly, and offers Ford's latest automatic transmission, while
electronic traction control is standard with the 24-valve Cosworth
engine. Many of the underpinnings come from the previous car, but there
are several alterations to the suspension settings.
After a slow start, more and more Scorpios are being seen around,
which suggests that, however mixed opinions about the new executive Ford
may be, the company has another sector best seller on its books.

AT a time when the office market in Edinburgh is at its lowest ebb, we
have the conundrum of a renaissance in development, with more offices
being built than ever before. We have a virtually deserted Charlotte
Square, a projected evacuation from St Andrew Square and a forest of
letting boards in the West End, contrasting with burgeoning new office
blocks rising phoenix-like from former former wastelands and gap sites
such as Leith Docks, Lothian Road and the Gyle.
What is going on and how can a bemused property professional, never
mind the public, understand the phenomenon? Theories abound -- I have
heard bar room talk from the property industry blaming such diverse
parties as the planners, the Scottish Office, the banks and insurance
companies, Wallace Mercer and David Murray for the current state of
play. Each has had a part to play. The major players tend to be the
planning authorities, the principal occupants and the developers. But
what caused the situation and is it a good or bad thing?
My own view is that it occurred because the centre of Edinburgh is a
conservation area and the planners and our city fathers, quite
correctly, would not permit large-scale offices. However, they wrongly
restricted consents to the centre and would not allow development in
peripheral areas. This resulted in the crazy situation in 1990 of
Edinburgh having the fourth highest office rental in the world, behind
Hong Kong, New York and London.
The planning policy was attacked by the city's major employers --
mainly the banks and insurance companies -- property developers and
surveyors until eventually it was relaxed. Consent was granted to David
Murray to carry out his successful Gyle development and then the
floodgates opened, with the Scottish Office moving to Victoria Quay in
Leith, Standard Life going to Canonmills and now Lothian Road; Scottish
Equitable, Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank, International Computers and
others leaving town for the Gyle and Scottish Widows intent on quitting
St Andrew Square for Morrison Street.
The common theme behind these moves was that the eighties boom created
a need for more office space.
All the major moves were planned in the boom years and a combination
of the resultant vacant offices and the effects of the recession have
caused an over-supply in the centre. This should be a temporary
situation and we are already seeing subtle changes of policy with the
planning authorities, while correctly protecting the city's Georgian
heritage, allowing interiors to be altered to provide the type of space
companies require.
Although parts of the New Town which were on the periphery of office
use such as Palmerston Place, Great King Street and Albany Street may
well revert to residential use, there is little doubt that as and when a
recovery is confirmed new and thriving firms of solicitors, accountants
and maybe even surveyors will again find elegant addresses such as
Charlotte Square, St Andrew Square and Melville Street attractive.

EXCLUSIVE:
RANGERS re-started training yesterday, signed Stephen Wright from
Aberdeen, and the first-team squad found themselves facing a cash
bonanza next month when they play in the preliminary round of the
European Cup -- the two games which stand between the Ibrox men and the
money-spinning Champions' League.
I understand that Rangers' leading players -- including yesterday's
signing Wright -- will share close to #500,000 if they qualify for the
tournament's league stage. That would mean as much as #30,000 for each
man.
It may seem an amazing lure for the players, but if Rangers do reach
that elite stage, then the club can look forward to an income of around
#6m from their three guaranteed games against the very best of European
opposition.
To get there, millionaire chairman David Murray and manager Walter
Smith have worked out the kind of bonus which would reward the players
-- and which would give the Ibrox club the kind of financial clout from
these three games alone which would further strengthen their hold on
Scottish football.
They have always been ready to reward their players. They did so when
they defeated Leeds United three seasons ago to reach the then fledgling
Champions' League. At that time, the rate was around #10,000 per player.
This time, with the stakes even higher, the bonuses have increased to
the biggest ever offered by a Scottish club.
But by offering such high rewards the club will attract the likes of
Paul Gascoigne and others to Ibrox. Gascoigne will sign on at Ibrox on
Monday, and yesterday, after overseeing the capture of Wright, Smith
indicated that two more players will be joining the club.
''We have two players now, and we would like to have two more in place
to prepare for our opening European tie,'' he said.
''We hope to hear about Florin Radicioiou by the end of the week. We
have not put any deadline on the move, but we want to have it concluded
as soon as possible.''
''There have been delays, because his agent has been in Brazil on
other business, and now that he has returned, we think that everything
can be worked out.''
Rangers have agreed a #2.5m fee for the Romanian with his Spanish club
Espanol, but the deal has been dogged by problems.
Smith was scathing about suggestions that Andy Goram could leave the
club. ''How could I let the best Scottish goalkeeper there is leave this
club when we are going into Europe?'' demanded Smith. ''I don't know
where that one came up, but you can forget it.''
As regards other moves away from Ibrox, Smith maintained that he had
yet to field any enquiries. However, it does seem likely that Sheffield
Wenesday's new manager, David Pleat, will move for Trevor Steven, and
that the unsettled Basile Boli will be on his way out of Glasgow.
ROBERTO Baggio has joined AC Milan from Juventus in a deal worth
around #12.9m. He will receive about #1.5m a year for three years, while
Juventus will pocket about #8.4m over two years.
* MARK Hughes finalised his #1.5m move to Chelsea yesterday.

As Ford's inexpensive new Galaxy leads the challenge from the second
generation of multi-purpose vehicles, Malcolm McDougall takes a look at
the price tags and finds out how much money can buy
THE real battle for supremacy in the market for people carriers is due
to start on N-Day, August 1, when market leader Ford enters the MPV
sector for the first time with its new Galaxy.
As the forerunner of the second generation of people movers, Ford's
vehicle has clearly learned a lot from earlier mistakes.
For starters it is far removed from the modified-van look of earlier
MPVs, or multi-purpose vehicles, and not only shares the smoother
styling of a big estate car, but drives like one.
To make sure the Galaxy gets a foot in the door of the market, Ford
has priced it at a level likely to ignite an all-out sales war.The
Galaxy also has a host of add-on goodies ranging from a fridge to
integral cycle-carriers to boost its dual business/leisure appeal.
Launching it in Scotland, Ford UK's marketing director Tom Pallister
said: ''We are not chasing a niche market with Galaxy. It is a
mainstream model and we intend to take conventional cars and estates
head-on for sales.
''Until now only the surface of the MPV market has been scratched with
vehicles aimed primarily at families with two or three kids and a dog.''
Galaxy, which starts at #15,995 for the 2-litre version, will be
chasing buyers from young single drivers attracted by the variety of
features it offers, to grandparents who like taking the family out en
masse.
The cheapest model undercuts the base Renault Espace Helios by around
#1200, rising to as much as #5000 in the top-of-the-range V-6 Ghia at
#23,300.
Later this year the launch vehicles will be joined by the upmarket
leather-trimmed Ultima version and a 4x4 is promised in 1996.
The aggressive pricing policy adopted by the UK's leading manufacturer
has taken even Volkswagen, its partner in the MPV factory in Portugal,
by surprise. VW, which is due to launch its almost identical version
called Sharan in September, is now reconsidering its own pricing
structure.
With other rivals, including Peugeot, Fiat, Honda, Mercedes, SEAT,
Chrysler and Vauxhall lining up to join the MPV bandwagon, industry
pundits hint that the bubble for people movers could be about to burst
with a big bang.
But, according to a new report by the Economist Intelligence Unit,
luxury cars are most likely to suffer as the new wave of versatile MPVs
takes the market by storm.
Cars are set to become smaller in Western Europe during the next five
years as a result of governments imposing increasingly high fuel and
vehicle taxation.
''Contrary to recent fears, we maintain sales of MPVs will be enhanced
by the downsizing in cars,'' claims the report.
It adds: ''Vehicles such as these are more in line with emerging
European market conditions, and could expand total MPV sales
considerably.''
With the launch of the Galaxy, Ford admits to banking heavily on the
success of MPVs in other markets.
Sales chiefs point out that the MPV boom in the USA went from sales of
just 12,000 in 1982 to 1.4 million last year, and say a new market
sector will emerge in the UK. In Europe sales have accelerated from
82,100 in 1990 to 174,000 in 1994, and in the UK from 7200 in 1990 to
14,400 last year.
To ensure its second-generation MPV by-passed any flaws in the
original, Ford carried out extensive pre-launch market research on the
Galaxy.
This revealed that the biggest turn-off for potential buyers was
van-like looks followed by sliding doors. More than 49,000 drivers in
the UK were questioned, and 40% ''liked the idea of a Galaxy-type
vehicle''.
A remarkable 15% of company car user-choosers would definitely
consider owning one, which would open up new outlets in the lucrative
fleet market for the MPV.
Despite the arrival of the new Ford/VW challenger, and others about to
follow, the original MPV, the Renault Espace, is confident of retaining
its 50% share of the market cake.
Having already fought off advances from Japanese producers including
Toyota with the Previa, Nissan's Serena and Mitsubishi's Space Wagon,
Renault has just added new style and specification to ensure its
original people carrier remains a front runner.
Gearing up for the shockwave of new competition, the revamped Espace
features a driver's airbag, a stronger safety cage, and the choice of as
many as three sunroofs. The power of the diesel-engined Espace has also
been boosted, and prices start at #17,352.
The Shuttle, from Honda, is a new Far East challenge aimed directly at
the Espace.
Unlike Ford and others chasing a new mass market approach, Honda is
counting on a more exclusive lift-off for its Shuttle.
Aiming for an upmarket appeal, the smoothly-styled Shuttle, which has
car-like looks and handling to match, will be sold in one model form
only at #22,995.
Up to six people can travel in armchair style in the Shuttle, and
standard features run to air-conditioning, anti-lock brakes, twin air
bags, plus electric windows and sunroof.
Power is supplied by a smooth 2.2 litre engine from the Accord, giving
speeds of up to 114mph and average economy of 27.6mpg.
Sold only in automatic transmission form, the Shuttle on the move in
Scotland proved it had car-like driving qualities.
Driving, or riding as a passenger in the Shuttle is an extremely
pleasant experience, especially in the four ''captain's chairs'' up
front, or the bench seat for two in the rear.
But the hefty price tag hints at why Honda is staying clear of the
ensuing MPV price war and importing only 700 vehicles into the UK.
Meanwhile, for conventional car and estate owners wishing to join the
MPV set without involving a price penalty, there is hope on the horizon.
Daihatsu has joined the people mover race with its amazing Hijet MPV.
Clearly based on the van, this astonishing newcomer claims to be the
UK's cheapest and smallest people carrier at just #7995.
Based on the Hijet panel van, this five-door MPV seats six providing
you limit luggage to a toothbrush. However, the rear seats can be folded
to provide reasonable luggage space.
Daihatsu is counting on selling around 1000 Hijets. Power is supplied
by a small but energetic 1-litre, three-cylinder engine, making it
capable of hitting the legal limit of 70mph.
Frills are few and far between, with twin sunroofs and a stereo, on
offer. But if you need an economical six-seater capable of returning
more than 35mpg, there is nothing, Galaxy and Shuttle included, to touch
the diminutive Hijet.
Expected to be the last of the current flood of MPVs, the Vauxhall
version, expected to hit the UK and European markets next year, is a
joint project with its General Motors parent in America.
Capable of seating up to seven passengers, the new Vauxhall people
mover is similar in style and concept to the Chrysler Voyager being
built in Austria for the European market.
Unlike its challengers on this side of the Atlantic, the newcomer from
GM will have sliding doors, which are favoured by American drivers.
Access to the middle and rear row of seats is claimed to be excellent
through the two sliding side doors.
Power will be supplied by GM's Ecotec engines running from 2-litres to
24-valve V6 units for the luxury versions.
Tipped to make its debut at the 1996 Paris Motor Show, the Vauxhall
MPV will be able to muscle in on the market late due to its low-cost
production benefits in the US.

THE retail market in Glasgow in 1995 is dramatically different to that
of last year. Over the past six months, almost all the prime retail
stock has been taken up, with all the difficult units which have been
overhanging the market, together with units created out of the former
Arnotts department store, now either let or under offer.
Reverse premiums and long let-free periods are a thing of the past.
Over a relatively short time positive premiums, which are in some cases
substantial, have been introduced. This is fueling rental growth, which
is great for investors but not so good for retailers. All this is
happening at a time when retailers are finding trading conditions
extremely tough and their margins are under constant pressure.
The prime deals which have taken place in the city so far this year
include: new stores for New Look, The Gap, Birthdays, State of
Independence, JB Sports and Jeanster on Argyle Street; for Esprit,
Jigsaw and Racing Green on Buchanan Street, and for Mothercare, Vision
Express and State of Independence on Sauchiehall Street.
With a shortage of quality retail stock, current market conditions
will certainly prevail until the turn of the year, with premiums
increasing steadily for the right product. This turnaround from a
surplus to a shortage is not just a Glasgow phenomenon. Indeed, it is
being experienced in most High Streets across Scotland. Significant
rental growth is arising because retailers need to expand turnover
through new store acquisitions rather than simply waiting for natural
price and subsequently sales inflation.
Can the retailers cope with this rental growth? Are they going to
trade their way out of what is undoubtedly a difficult period? And what
new opportunities will there be in Glasgow? There are two major shopping
centres currently proposed -- a 600,000 sq ft complex at Braehead just
off the M8 at Renfrew, and the Buchanan Centre, a 600,000 sq ft city
centre development to be anchored by a 300,000 sq ft John Lewis store.
There are conflicting views among Glasgow's retail agents over the
likely success or otherwise of these centres. Assuming the
infrastructure difficulties are resolved at Braehead, I think it is
going to be one of the most successful regional shopping centres in the
UK. Every retailer will want to be represented and Capital Shopping
Centres is the most experienced developer in this field. The potential
catchment area will be vast, drawing from the south side of Glasgow,
Paisley and West Renfrewshire together with areas on the north side of
the river, due to easy access via the Erskine Bridge and Clyde Tunnel.
Retailers will want to be located with Braehead because it will be the
only centre of its kind in Scotland and they will never have a greater
opportunity than at the outset. Due to its location, 6500 parking spaces
and leisure elements including ice rinks and cinemas, it will be a
retailing success in every respect.
The Buchanan Centre, its future success and its impact on the existing
shopping provision in Glasgow is the subject of much debate. There is no
doubt John Lewis will trade successfully, but will the city's shopper be
prepared to make fundamental changes to his or her shopping habits? At
present there are two distinct shopping areas in the centre (leaving
aside the Merchant City) -- Argyle Street/Buchanan Street and
Sauchiehall Street.
The former is principally an end of week/Saturday and latterly Sunday
trading location, whereas Sauchiehall Street is more of an everyday
street, in particular Monday through to Friday. Because of its close
proximity to the office core, it is an ideal shopping area for office
workers. All the major national multiples are represented there as well
as on Argyle Street/Buchanan Street, and the big question is whether
they will be prepared to sacrifice existing Sauchiehall Street stores
for the new centre.
There is a view that once it opens it will devastate Sauchiehall
Street. However, I believe it will continue to prosper and will,
hopefully, be seen as complementary. The other school of thought relates
to whether Glasgow needs a shopping centre which would add 60 units to
the shopping core, not including the MSUs and John Lewis. I do not
believe it can cope with such a new development which, unless it can be
filled with retailers new to the city, will be no different to what we
have already, with the obvious exception of John Lewis.
A large number of shoppers will go to the Buchanan Centre solely
because of this store and will otherwise do most of the rest of their
shopping, as they currently do, on Argyle Street/Buchanan Street.
Nevertheless, I still believe the Buchanan Centre will be built and
that it will probably attract the retailers required to make it appear a
success. This ultimately will be down to their usual concern not to miss
out on something which might be good. At the end of the day, it is all a
question of timing, the level of rents being sought and what other
opportunities exist, not only in Glasgow but throughout the rest of the
UK.

IT is nearly 14 years since Clydebank was designated the first
Enterprise Zone in Scotland. Since then four other areas have been
granted similar status for a 10-year period -- Invergordon, Tayside,
Inverclyde and most recently Lanarkshire. Fourteen years is a long time
in the commercial property market and each of the zones has experienced,
in varying degrees, both strong and weak market conditions.
Originally perceived as an experiment in economic regeneration,
Enterprise Zones have proved a remarkably robust product in a property
market which, in recessionary times, has become increasingly selective
in its pursuit of opportunities.
There have been notable successes -- the transformation of the Singer
factory into Clydebank Business Park, the creation of Dundee Technology
Park at the western gateway to the city, and the development of one of
the largest manufacturing facilities to be seen in Scotland in recent
years at Faulds Park, Inverclyde. These and other initiatives have flown
in the face of the market commentators who considered Enterprise Zones
fundamentally unattractive because they existed only to counter the
effects of major rationalisation and decline in traditional industry.
What accounts for these successes during a period when little new
development was taking place across the country? For both occupiers and
investors Enterprise Zones offer significant financial benefit. If a
company or individual incurs capital expenditure on a qualifying
building, the definition of which encompasses a wide range of industrial
and office uses, it will attract 100% first-year tax allowances. For
investors or owner-occupiers this represents a saving of up to 40% on
qualifying costs.
Once in occupation, further benefits are available. Businesses in
Scotland will be only too aware that a general revaluation for rating is
takling place. Occupiers in Inverclyde and Lanarkshire Enterprise Zones
must surely smile broadly when they think of their competitors facing
increased costs as a result. No rates are payable during their zone
designation periods, which run until 1999 and 2003 respectively.
For many companies the prospects of securing substantial public
support creates a vision of endless red tape. Here again Enterprise
Zones score significantly. The key benefits of capital allowances and
rates relief are automatic. Provided capital expenditure has been
incurred and the property is used for a commercial purpose, the benefits
will simply flow.
This is not to say other forms of financial support are excluded
within Enterprise Zones. Regional Selective Assistance, which is awarded
on a discretionary basis, can be available in addition to full
Enterprise Zone benefits. It really is little wonder these zones have
attracted substantial investment and occupational activity over the last
14 years.
One misconception which may exist is that they are unattractive
locations for business. One might imagine such a level of financial
support would only be available for areas disadvantaged by poor
communications and difficult market accessibility. In the case of
Scotland's newest Enterprise Zone, Lanarkshire, this is clearly not the
case. Of its 10 zone sites, not one is more than 10 minutes away from a
motorway junction and several form extensions of already successful
industrial and commercial locations.
Because of the underlying attractions of Lanarkshire to business,
substantial developments have been committed and undertaken in the last
two years. It is interesting that, as well as creating speculative
accommodation for new and expanding companies, it has attracted a number
of owner-occupiers. At Tannochside Park, Alexander Russell, Watson &amp;
Philip and Kwik-Fit Insurance have all moved into purpose-built or
adapted facilities, while at Hamilton International Technology Park
Scottish Universal Newspapers has announced it is to construct a new
printing facility.
For the developers of speculative buildings and for prospective
tenants the fact that Lanarkshire is attracting substantially greater
volumes of owner-occupiers than other Scottish zones is important.
Consequently, through development undertaken to date and anticipated
during 1995, Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone now offers a wider range of
industrial and commercial premises than any other location in Scotland.
At Hamilton International Technology Park Akeler Developments
(Scotland) has just completed two of the largest speculative industrial
buildings on the national market. At 55,000 sq ft and 45,000 sq ft they
have been designed to meet the requirements of the inward investment
market where quality of design, specification and environment are
critical. These buildings are also available to local companies and
offer rate-free occupation until 2003.
Elsewhere within the zone units offering the same relief from rates
are available from 1000 sq ft in locations including Calder Street,
Coatbridge, and Excelsior Park, Wishaw. Developments are proposed for
East Shawhead and Excelsior Park to further enhance the range of
options. A real opportunity exists in Lanarkshire for any company
seeking new premises in a well-established business location where
unrivalled financial benefits are available.
It will be interesting in 2003 to look back at Lanarkshire and review
its success. Early indications are that some pride in its achievements
might be taken by all of those involved.

SUPPLY in Aberdeen's office market has increased by 7000 sq ft over
the last six months, to 640,000 sq ft, while take up has shown a much
smaller increase to just under 150,000 sq ft for the period. Take up for
the last 12 months totals 270,000 sq ft, which is the annual average
over the past 10 years.
The increase in supply is attributable to ongoing restructuring in the
oil industry, which has resulted in a number of suites, particularly in
the 2000 to 10,000 sq ft range, becoming surplus to requirements. In due
course, the amalgamations and regroupings which have caused the increase
in supply should generate demand for new space, and we are aware of a
number of substantial inquiries which could lead to lettings over the
next 12 months.
Prospective tenants will find it difficult to satisfy their
requirements from available stock, which is almost all at least 10-years
old and, for the most part, available only in suites of under 10,000 sq
ft. At the same time, the number of sites available for new office
development is rapidly reducing, as they are acquired by residential
developers, competing to meet the apparently insatiable demand for
central one and two-bedroom flats.
In recent months, sites with planning permission for more than 500,000
sq ft of offices have been acquired for residential development, but the
balance has been redressed a little by Jade Sea's application for
consent for 100,000 sq ft of space at the Hill of Rubislaw. This has
long been regarded as one of the best development sites in Aberdeen, but
until recently it has been occupied by a building let to BP. The lease
on this has now been relinquished, and the planning application brings
the development a step nearer, although it is unlikely to be built
speculatively.
The only speculative office building to have been competed in recent
years, the 15,000 sq ft Loirston House at Altens, has now been let to a
division of Schlumberger, the oil service company. The rent achieved was
sub-#15 per sq ft for a lease which includes regular break options and
is less than might have been expected for a new building, when prime
rents of #16.50 to #17.50 per sq ft for leases of 15 years or more have
been achieved in the west end. However, Loirston House's specification
fell short of many prospective tenants' expectations, otherwise there is
little doubt it would have let more quickly and at a better rental.
Other lettings over the period included 10,000 sq ft in Belmont House
(part of the Bon Accord Centre), where Grampian Regional Council's
finance and social work departments took an assignation of Halliburton's
lease at the passing rent of #14 per sq ft.
Grampian Regional Council and Aberdeen District Council are among the
largest office occupiers in the city and any changes in their
requirements following the change to unitary authorities next May are
bound to have an effect on the market.
It is unlikely any property decisions will be taken until nearer then,
but it is thought the new Aberdeen Council may require additional office
space in the vicinity of the current council offices in Broad Street. At
the same time it is felt by some that the new Aberdeenshire headquarters
should be located in the county itself (probably at Inverurie) rather
than at GRC's headquarters in Woodhill House.
A distinct two-tier market is emerging in Aberdeen in which the
limited supply of good quality space can achieve rentals of around #17,
while secondary space which is in abundant supply usually lets at no
better than #11 to #13 per sq ft. The imposition of rates on vacant
offices could encourage landlords to lower their asking rentals, but
given that most occupiers are now looking for a better standard of
accommodation, lower rents are unlikely to be enough on their own to
attract tenants to some of the older office stock.
The amalgamations and regroupings which have caused the increase in
supply should generate demand for new space -- we are aware of a number
of inquiries which could lead to lettings over the next 12 months

WIMBLEDON '95
BORIS Becker had to dig very deep yesterday evening to defy a comeback
from Frenchman Cedric Pioline on No.1 Court and complete a top-class
line-up in the semi-finals after a nail-biting encounter that has been
long overdue at Wimbledon this year.
Becker's 6-3, 6-1, 6-7, 6-7, 9-7 triumph means that the leading eight
seeds will contest the closing stages in the men's and women's events
for the first time since seeding began in 1927.
The German now meets top-seed Andre Agassi in a match that should be a
real crowd pleaser. But both men will have to go some to top a
pulse-quickening confrontation of yesterday when the German, who won the
first of his three Wimbledon titles as a 17-year-old a decade ago,
needed just more than four hours to lay to rest his French rival's
challenge from two sets down.
''When a match gets to that stage it's about desire and fitness, they
go hand in hand,'' said Becker. ''You have to be fit, but the bottom
line is that you have to have the desire to win.
''Even when I was a break down in the fifth I had that hunger and
desire to say that I wasn't going to give up, that he would have to play
great for another 15 or 20 minutes to beat me. That was one of the
keys.''
Pioline, a beaten finalist in the US Open two years ago, looked set
for the next flight home to Paris as Becker breezed through the opening
two sets.
But if Becker believed it was just a formality for him to reach the
semi-final for the third year in a row, he had to think again. Pioline
stormed back with a revival that reduced Becker's wife Barbara to a
nervous wreck.
It seemed Becker would be content to wrap up the match in a third-set
tie-break, but it was Pioline who dictated the pace -- needing six
set-points to win it.
And he needed eight more in the fourth, winning 12-10 in another
tie-break marathon as Becker also spurned a match-point, but was still
lucky to see the Frenchman waste chance after chance.
A break down in the fifth, having held his first-game serve to love
and fought back from love-30 to deuce before surrendering the second,
Becker refused to let Pioline realise his dream -- or let the punters,
who had reportedly launched a Europe-wide gamble on the Frenchman at
7-2, collect their money.
It was all square at 4-4 and Becker wasted two more match-points
before his rival finally struck consecutive volleys too long.
Agassi made sure of his place in the round of the last four with a
straight-sets success against Holland's Jacco Eltingh in under two
hours. And then the American decided to have afternoon tea instead of
watching Becker's struggle.
''I'd sooner have tea than watch Boris,'' said Agassi. ''I've seen him
playing plenty of times.'' The American completed his twenty-third Grand
Slam victory in 24 matches with a fine display of power hitting.
''That was the best I have hit the ball,'' said Agassi. ''I'm striking
it cleanly and not making many errors. I'm on form and into the
semi-finals. One of the newspapers said I was short, fat, bald, and ugly
but I feel fitter and lighter.''
His No.1 fan, Brooke Shields, watched the 1992 champion reach his
second Wimbledon semi-final in ruthless mood. ''Playing on Centre Court
seems to bring out my best tennis,'' said Agassi. ''This is the Masters
in golf. If you can only win one tournament you pick this one. It's the
greatest tournament in the world.''
Eltingh's big moment came in the third set when he had a break point
to lead 4-1. The world No.27 might just have got back in the match if he
had put a simple backhand away. But he blasted the ball wide.
Eltingh left a trail of distinguished scalps in his wake to reach the
last eight. Former singles champion Michael Stich, former world No.1
Mats Wilander, and seventh seed Wayne Ferreira all bowed out to the
Monte Carlo-based 24-year-old.

THE pace of change in the industry has been and continues to be
breathtaking. In the last 10 years we have been introduced to such
innovations as design and build, project management, fee competition,
quality assurance, CDM regulations, class IV, PFI and indeed the latest
industry buzz expression DMC with a GMP (design-manage-construct with a
guaranteed maximum price). Privatisation, contracting out, Latham, local
government reorganisation and numerous other variables also have to be
taken in one's stride.
Design and build, in one form or another, now forms a substantial part
of construction industry output. While securing single-point
responsibility and enhanced comfort on price and programme are the
perceived advantages, these can only be achieved if the process is
administered properly. The essence of success for all parties must be a
clear definition of the employer's requirements. Thankfully there is a
welcome trend towards the US system whereby the client, in conjunction
with his or her design team, establishes the form and style of the
building before tendering.
One of the most advantageous spin-offs from the introduction of design
and build is the general improvement in the relationship of clients with
consultants and contractors, who now clearly recognise business is very
much a two-way street. Certainly we have found confrontation and, dare I
say it, claims very much on the decrease.
Fee competition is a current trend favoured in the main by bureaucrats
and financial controllers but not construction professionals. The
argument that consultancy services are intangible and their quality
difficult to compare and value has much validity, but clients are
entitled to assure themselves of the competitiveness of a proposal.
Surely, however, this could be achieved by reference to a published
recommended fee scale.
Price, be it fees or contractors' tender values, is inextricably
linked to quality. Quality can only be achieved through investment in
our basic raw materials. In the construction industry that is people,
and their education and training is fundamental.
As with all industry the recession has bitten deeply into everybody's
plans and projections. It is interesting though how few notable
casualties there have been in the construction industry, a testament
perhaps to the resilience of its members.
Tender levels have risen sharply over the last nine months or so, most
especially in the public sector residential market. Construction pricing
is now, if anything, slightly higher than in the pre-recession times of
mid-1992. This is mainly due to material and labour price increases
together with a general uplift in sub-contractor pricing because of the
increased supply of work. Main contractor margins are, however, still
extremely tight and very few are experiencing any significant feel good
factor.
The commercial office market is slow. A few old schemes have been
dusted down and instigated, and there are two or three major new ones
which look as though they may be progressed. These include the
redevelopment of Alhambra House and Broomielaw phase III in Glasgow.
Out-of-town activity or class IV would appear to be on the increase,
with a number of schemes progressing including our own project at
Strathclyde Business Park, where the second phase of 70,000 sq ft is
nearing completion.
The retail position is also patchy. While the market has been buoyed
in recent years by the influx of discount retailers, larger supermarket
and retail warehousing schemes have been restricted by planning policy.
Setting aside the effects of competing demand, the positive noises being
made about the imminent progress of Glasgow's Buchanan Centre and
Braehead developments are very encouraging. The commencement of the
retro-fit of Shawlands arcade and the possibility of CIN undertaking
redevelopment of its properties in Paisley town centre are also welcome
signs.
We are experiencing an encouraging number of enquiries from
manufacturers looking to construct bespoke factories in response to new
technology and the anticipation of major orders. Speculative industrial
development is limited and would benefit from further public sector
encouragement. Schemes such as Mossend, Tannochside and Bothwell Park
would, however, appear to be generating interest.
Signs in the leisure market also appear fairly encouraging with a
number of bingo halls, budget hotels, restaurant chains, leisure clubs
and the like being progressed. The advent of millennium funding will
further stimulate this sector.
While confidence in the housing market still seems low, developers are
pursuing both site acquisitions and development programmes. The public
sector housing market is a ready source of work, although the sharp rise
in tender levels may curtail the number of projects which progress.
Opportunities in local health care and public sector projects in
general look reasonable. The introduction of PFI may polarise
expenditure to some extent, however it is presumed that local government
reorganisation will stimulate the market for investment in public
amenities.
All in all, there are encouraging signs that the construction market
is continuing to pick up. As in all areas of business, one has to try
and keep one's finger very firmly on the pulse and be as flexible and
responsive to market variables as possible. We celebrated our 10th
anniversary this year and are certainly looking forward very positively
to our next 10 years in business.

AS Glasgow moves into the second half of the nineties, hopefully out
of recession and into a steadily improving economy, we are seeing a
fundamental change in the way the city centre is developing to cater for
the needs of the office occupier.
It is difficult to forecast what will happen in the next millennium,
but there is no doubt that over the past two decades the emphasis for
office development has been westwards moving up St Vincent Street and
West George Street and over Blythswood Hill, to come up against the M8
acting as a corset restraining any further drift.
Like leaking water trying to find an escape route, this has benefited
the area south of Bothwell Street along the Waterloo Street/Cadogan
Street axis and recent developments along the Broomielaw. There are
exceptions such as the Park area, which has probably suffered most as a
result of the recession and parts of which will revert to residential
use, to which the buildings are best suited.
Confidence has not fully returned to the market, but there are some
encouraging signs and certain trends are beginning to exert an
influence. The inexorable move westwards and the drift down to the river
has halted and we are now seeing large-scale developments taking place
downtown, reversing the trend of the past two decades.
Leases of obsolete large sixties and seventies buildings are
terminating, allowing redevelopment or substantial refurbishment. This
will bring the large space user back go the centre, enabling him to
acquire floorplates hitherto available only on the periphery.
The city centre -- with its shopping facilities, underground and
mainline stations, eating and entertainment establishments -- is really
where the headquarters occupier would prefer to be, given the choice. In
the mid-eighties the alternatives were either west of Blythswood Hill or
on the Broomielaw, the latter totally divorced from the city centre and
pleasant enough provided you had a river frontage, but a good walk or
taxi ride from wherever you wanted to go.
The business park, introduced by the Town &amp; Country Planning
(Scotland) (Use Classes Order) 1989, and partially stillborn as a result
of the recession, is now beginning to emerge again. The best located
will be along the M8/M74. Those large space occupiers who do not need a
central location can now move to these sites which have good
communications, generous parking and floorplates tailormade to their
requirements. Although, a survey we carried out recently showed that few
occupiers actually knew their requirements in terms of floor size and
wanted to assess each building on its own merits.
Most important of all, however, is likely to be the rental
differential between city centre and business park. This is of the order
of #18.50 per sq ft against #13.50 -- a persuasive factor if you require
significant amounts of accommodation.
In my view, the choice between downtown and out of town is likely to
be the key one, provided landlords create the right product dictated by
the market rather than the other way round as we saw during the
eighties. The glitz and glamour of large areas of polished marble and
stainless steel is not compatible with today's lean but efficient
business image, where cost is the determinant.
The opportunities now available for large-space occupiers in the city
centre offer the inward investor or indeed Glasgow-based company a
choice that has not been available for over 20 years.
Examples include Scottish Life House in St Vincent Street, where the
former Western Club and adjoining late sixties building have been
refurbished to provide a dramatic new look; the former Alhambra House,
which Friends Provident is redeveloping to offer 90,000 sq ft of space
with average floorplates of 14,000 sq ft; Scottish Amicable's proposed
redevelopment of 181/195 West George Street to provide 77,000 sq ft with
floorplates of 13,000 sq ft, and Lomond House in George Square with
67,000 sq ft divided into floorplates of 7000 sq ft.
Most significant of all, though, is the potential offered by the sale
of the head Post Office in George Square, which will only appeal to the
most skilled developers. This has to be the most prestigious address of
all, capable of providing 180,000 sq ft of accommodation on floors of
34,000 sq ft.
There may also be other significant redevelopment opportunities
elsewhere, such as those offered by the grim canyon of India Street,
presently housing Strathclyde Regional Council and a number of
departments. This space may soon become surplus to requirements as there
is a strong prospect they may move to phase II of Cochrane Square.
What we are seeing is a return to the traditional core values of
location, in a difficult market the most important factor in the choice
of any building. Those properties able to provide this will succeed in
attracting the best occupiers at the best rents, providing their owners
with the best returns -- something which has been overlooked in recent
years and which we would do well to remember.

ATHLETICS
LINFORD Christie's pay dispute with the British Athletic Federation
lingered on after his world championship momentum stalled at the
Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne last night.
The federation's executive chairman Peter Radford had expressed
''cautious optimism'' that the dispute would be settled.
And, in anticipation, a lane was declared open for Christie in both
sprints at tomorrow's KP Games at Crystal Palace.
But, after finishing fourth in the 100m and third in the 200m,
Christie declared: ''That is another story.
''The ball is in their court. They are the furthest thing from my mind
at the moment.''
Those comments suggested that Christie, who missed last weekend's
meeting at Gateshead, would also be absent in London.
Roger Black was all smiles after turning the clock back with 44.59sec
in the 400m, equalling his career best set at the 1986 European
Championships.
It was not enough to hold hooded Darnell Hall (44.34) and fellow
American Derek Mills (44.47).
The US threat to Colin Jackson's defence of the world 110m hurdles
title grew as Roger Kingdom led home world indoor champion Allen
Johhnson in 13.11. The Welshman missed the event through illness.
Frenchman Stephane Diagana broke German Harald Schmid's 13-year-old
European 400m hurdles record with 47.37.

East of Scotland Retail
MAKE no mistake, the retail market is as tough now as it has ever
been. Only last week What Everyone Wants issued a profits warning,
blaming poor weather and the absence of the feel good factor as the
principal problems. Interestingly, it also cited the National Lottery as
a factor behind disappointing sales.
Apparently, many of its typical customers are spending an average of
#5 on Lottery tickets between Friday and Saturday evenings. This is
money which might otherwise have been spent at the tills, and I suspect
other retailers will be similarly frustrated by the apparent success of
the Lottery. Competing for customers' disposable income was difficult
enough before and it is just another reason why only those offering true
value for money will survive in the present economic climate.
However, against this background, the retail property market in
Edinburgh exhibits no lack of demand, indeed it is quite the reverse,
and competition for prime space continues to exceed supply. Prime means
Princes Street, and there are a number of retailers who have long
standing requirements for representation. Given the lack of
opportunities, in all the deals concluded in the last 12 months the
in-going tenant has paid a premium. These include Virgin and Dixons, who
both relocated to larger stores, The Sweater Shop, which acquired a
second outlet on the street, and The Gap.
Perhaps the most significant deal of all is the letting of one of the
units on the site of the Palace Hotel, which was destroyed by fire
approximately three years ago. La Senza, which is to open its first
store in Scotland in the redevelopment, is reputed to be paying a
premium of #100,000 for the benefit of a new lease at a record #158 zone
A.
At the east end of Princes Street, the St James Centre, refurbished at
a cost of more than #15m approximately two years ago, has attracted new
tenants in recent months. Lettings have been achieved to ScottishPower,
Pinnacle and The Works and rents consolidated at around #100 zone A.
Apart from the obvious draw of The John Lewis Partnership, the centre
boasts 1200 parking spaces.
Parking is not an issue approximately five miles west of the city
centre, where the Gyle, with its 2600 free spaces, is now fully let.
Again, de
mand would appear to exceed supply and a planning application was
submitted on April 28 for a 30,000 sq ft 10 unit extension. In addition,
Marks &amp; Spencer has announced it wants to add a further 30,000 sq ft to
its existing store. Zone A rents are around #75.
In the face of competition from the Gyle, the scheme at Cameron Toll,
situated two miles south of the city centre, has plans to increase both
the number of units and car parking provision. These measures, in
conjunction with the continuing attraction of Sainsbury's Savacentre,
should ensure it retains an important niche in the Edinburgh retail
hierarchy. Rents are around #70 zone A.
There has also been some activity in the Newkirkgate centre in Leith.
Recent lettings to ScottishPower and Birthdays are about to be followed
by one to another national multiple which will raise rents from around
#20 zone A.
The retail warehouse market shows similar positive signs. Hermiston
Gate, the 200,000 sq ft scheme due to open in October, following
completion of the M8 and the city bypass link, is already pre-let. The
open class I planning consent has allowed entry to fashion and sports
operators such as Olympus, Shoe City and Children's World, and
competition from these uses has pushed up rents to around #20 per sq ft.
At this level, it will be interesting to see whether the carpet, home
furnishing and electrical retailers, who have traditionally occupied
these parks, are able to trade profitably in the future.
The lack of available space both in and out of town, and the absence
of any significant developments to take up the latent demand, will
continue to ensure premiums are paid for existing leases, and where
opportunities to let units on the open market exist, there is a capacity
for rental growth. This is good news for landlords of commercial
property who should benefit if the size, lay-out and location of their
investment is right -- despite the present demand, retailers are now
more discerning and will not compromise on these criteria simply to gain
representation. It is encouraging to note that some lessons have been
learned from the past.

TWO years ago Jana Novotna let slip a 4-1 lead in the final set in the
Wimbledon women's final against Steffi Graf.
Today the 26-year-old Czech faces Graf in the semi-final stage of this
year's event -- the fourth time they have met at Wimbledon -- still
denying that she choked on that famous afternoon.
Since then Novotna has played the German six times, and on each
occasion she has been beaten in straight sets.
''When I played Steffi in the final it was one of those things,'' said
Novotna, ''and I hope that this time it will be different.''
Novotna's last victory against Graf was three years ago and, since
their first clash in 1987, Graf has beaten her 23 times in 26 meetings,
and today may be no different, especially as Graf is arguably playing
better than at any previous Wimbledon.
The other semi-final features the girls from Barcelona, Conchita
Martinez, the reigning champion, and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario anxious to
prove they are the best in Spain as well as at Wimbledon.
Martinez may just have the edge but whichever Spanish woman is
successful today, only a recurrence of her back problem seems likely to
stop Graf from winning the title for a sixth time on Saturday.

<FLAG>EXECUTIVE CARS REVIEW</FLAG>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>977535146</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Ross Finlay introduces this six-page review and finds manufacturers
hard at work creating attractive new designs to tempt the upwardly
mobile executive.
SINCE our last review of executive cars the market has gone through a
period of changes, some fundamental, others influenced by fashion.
Unusually at a time when the economic indicators are not good, there
has been a flurry of innovatory work at most of the major car
manufacturers. It has been an enormously costly business, offering no
more than a break-even chance of market success, but at the same time
exciting and challenging.
Perhaps one of the most significant changes of tack has occurred with
regard to car styling. Designers are now being given bigger budgets and
sharper pencils. Computers have been pushed into the background and
given the boring parts to do, while gifted artists undertake the type of
creative work no amount of chips can match. Hence the MGF, Fiat Coupe,
Rover 400/600 and svelte new Jaguar models.
Not since the late sixties has creativity been given quite so much
recognition. And it is paying off. Despite an overall dip in
registrations this year -- particularly in the private sector -- most
manufacturers are back in the black and price rises are running at the
same rate as inflation.
All of which means an expanded choice for the consumer (witness the
rash of MPVs or ''people carriers'' coming on stream) and more money for
the manufacturers to spend on safety and on reducing still further the
damaging effect of the internal combustion engine on the environment.
The 7.47% rise in business during 1994 played an important part in
this. It suggested an even better 1995, but present indicators are that
any recovery will come later in the year and even then total sales will
fall just short of last year's figure.
But profitability should rise. This apparent paradox can be explained
by two significant developments. The first is that all of the main
players are now operating with a leaner, more highly trained workforce
backed by better robotics and supply processes. It takes fewer man hours
to account for each car coming off the production lines and just-in-time
delivery of components has eased pressure on stockholdings.
We have also seen a lessening of the degree of market manipulation
which was rife last year when manufacturers rushed to pre-register
unsold stocks at the end of every month in an effort to put a gloss on
sales totals. This left angry dealers with huge stocks of ''nearly new''
cars they had to shift at knockdown prices, depressing the value of
trade-ins and in some cases hitting new car sales as people quickly
realised the so-called ''demonstrator'' at #2000 or #3000 off was
actually a brand new car which could be snapped up tax free.
Downsizing, the process of reducing the overall dimensions (and cost)
of executive cars by packing extra equipment into smaller models, was
expected to be a strong feature of 1995.
To some extent it is happening. The best-selling Vauxhall Omega, for
example, is smaller than the Senator/Carlton duo it replaced, but the
new Ford Scorpio is as hefty as ever despite a complete redesign that
drew more from the studios of Detroit than from Cologne or Brentwood.
From what we know of the upcoming Cavalier replacement, the Vectra, no
significant size reduction has taken place there either.
On the other side of the coin, Renault's medium-sized Laguna sold more
than 20,000 units here in the final nine months of 1994. The French
giant confidently expects to boost this to 40,000 in 1995, while its
bigger, better specified Safrane lingers at 81st in the popularity
charts with a miserly 2700 sales in 1994 and little prospect of
improvement this time around. What has made all the difference has been
the fact the Laguna is only marginally smaller, but is almost as well
equipped for a lot less money.
Rover 800 sales have also fallen back in favour of the newer 600
series. The arrival of the 400, based on the same platform as the Honda
Civic released last year, but vastly superior in terms of external
styling and interior furnishing, may well do further damage -- even
prompting Rover to drop the 800 altogether and allow new owner BMW to
slip one of its own cars into the vacant slot.
Elsewhere the picture becomes even more confusing for all but
dedicated market watchers. The luxury F-sector has been boosted by new
models from Jaguar, BMW and Audi. This has sparked off renewed interest
in a part of the market once regarded to be in terminal decline.
Jaguar increased sales by an impressive 50% last month, while
arch-rival BMW claimed a whopping 233% upsurge in 7-series cars sold.
The latter, of course, was operating from a very low base figure, so it
is really Jaguar's performance here that is most significant.
This year we can also expect another full-scale assault from Toyota,
whose new Lexus LS400 may well begin to make some sort of footprint,
albeit not mirroring its success in America. It appears that British
boardrooms are still bastions of resistance when it comes to luxury
Japanese machinery.
The orientals do better in the astonishing 4x4 market which continues
to grow in the face of an almost universal belief that the bubble is
about to burst. Long-term leader Land Rover is working its plant at full
capacity in an effort to keep up with a growing order book.
Cheaper vehicles such as the Isuzu-based Vauxhall Frontera, despite
being an old design, have also gained wide acceptance and the sector is
now large enough to support several niche vehicles, such as the Toyota
RAV4, surely a sign that the 4x4 will be with us for many years to come.
Manufacturers not fully committed to on/off roadsters, such as Ford,
VW, Peugeot, Honda, Citroen, Fiat, SEAT and Renault, now have the gloves
off for what promises to be the scrap of the year, centred on MPVs. Some
of the contenders are already in the ring and the new models, the Ford
Galaxy, VW Sharan and Honda Shuttle, have all been warmly received.
Can they or the others that have still to reach the showrooms topple
the established Renault Espace from its perch at the top of this sector?
To date no manufacturer has succeeded in getting close to Land Rover in
the 4x4 field. Renault's corporate fingers will be crossed in the hope
that this piece of history will repeat itself.
As mentioned earlier, the choice of what vehicle to put into your slot
in the company car park has never been wider. Nor has it been better.

LINFORD Christie's world championship 100 metres momentum stalled at
the Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne last night.
Christie, who had a commanding win in Paris 48 hours earlier, was left
trailing as US trial winner Mike Marsh emerged as a serious threat to
his defence of the title next month.
Old rival Dennis Mitchell was the man being touted to interrupt
Christie's flying form.
Instead, it was the fast-starting Marsh who roared home in 9.96sec
with an over-the-legal-limit wind of 2.3m per second behind him.
A poor launch from the blocks proved costly for Christie, who although
closing in the run-in, could do better than finish fourth in 10.03.
Also ahead of him was Canada's Donovan Bailey (10.02) and Mitchell,
who was also credited with 10.03.

JIM McInally yesterday ended his nine-year association with Dundee
United by joining Scottish Coca-Cola Cup winners Raith Rovers for
#150,000.
The 31-year-old midfielder has signed a two-year contract with the
side who swopped places with the Tannadice club by gaining promotion to
the premier division last season.
McInally said the prospect of moving to a smaller club had not been a
consideration in his decision -- and that top-flight football and
Raith's European qualification was merely a bonus.
''It's all about job satisfaction and the type of people you're
working with,'' said McInally.

* DAVID Ginola had good reason yesterday to put off signing for
Newcastle -- the French internationalist had a date in Paris with
Claudia Schiffer. But the 28-year-old will be back on Tyneside today to
undergo a medical so he can complete his #2.5m transfer from Paris St
Germain and become the first Frenchman to sign for the St James's Park
club.
Newcastle had hoped to parade Ginola at a news conference yesterday
but he told them that he had a ''private appointment'' in Paris in the
evening. That turned out to be a fashion show with an Italian clothing
company and he will be sharing the stage with Schiffer.
* ASTON Villa manager Brian Little took his summer spending to #9.25m
yesterday by signing Leicester midfield player Mark Draper in a #3.25m
deal. Little signed Draper for #1.25m from Notts County when manager of
Leicester and has been keen to acquire his services since taking over at
Villa Park in December.
* CLYDE defender Martin Clark travelled south this week for trials
with Cambridge.
* HIBS defender Willie Miller has signed a new three-year deal with
the Edinburgh club.
Meanwhile, Hibs have arranged a pre-season match against QPR at Easter
Road on August 12.

BOWLS
SCOTLAND's hopes of recapturing the home international championship
after a 15-year gap received a boost yesterday when they beat the
Channel Islands 135-104 in Llanelli, despite the Scots finishing ahead
on just two of the six rinks.
Laying the victory foundations was Annan's Niall Currie, who powered
to a 38-8 win over Keith Ellis.
Raymond Logan added the second Scottish win beating Dave Lucas 22-10
and these two results proved more than enough to give the Scots overall
victory.
Captain Richard Corsie dropped 10 shots on the last three ends to lose
26-10 to Bernie Simon and the Channel Islanders scrambled narrow
victories in the three remaining matches.
John Aitken went down 19-17 to Cyril Renouf, Willie Wood lost 18-17 to
David le Marquand, and George Adrain surrendered a 20-7 lead as he
tasted defeat for the first time this week, losing 23-22 to Scots-born
Gus McKinnon.
Earlier in the day, Scotland lost in all three of the individual
British championships, going down in the junior singles, pairs, and
fours.
The bitterest defeat was in the pairs, where Maybole youngsters
Malcolm Mitchell and Graham Campbell went down 16-15 to the English
champions, Keith Wood and Mike Bennett from Ponteland.
In the fours, George Spiers' Drongan rink went down 21-11 to the
English champions from Cheltenham, skipped by world champion Tony
Allcock, while in the junior singles, Chirnside's Robert Patterson
surrendered an early 9-2 lead to Ireland's Jeremy Henry, who recovered
to win 21-15.

SAILING
GIVING the majority of English visitors to the Etchells UK National
and Open championships a first taste of the uglier face of Clyde racing,
a muscular westerly breeze brought driving drizzle, but it was the low
cloud and poor visiblity which reduced navigation to luck or pinpoint
accurate compass-work yesterday.
Poul Richard Hoj Jensen has had a taste of such conditions before when
he won the Dragon Edinburgh Cup in 1991 on the Clyde. Yesterday, the
double Olympic gold medallist chose the right side of all three windward
legs and was rewarded with his first win of the regatta, to retain third
place overall in Danish Blue.
Gourock's Keith Lawrence, who lies in second place overall after
finishing second yesterday, was involved in a protest for a rules
infringement involving the event leader Tim Law -- the current
title-holder.
Law alleged Lawrence tacked too close to him and the matter was under
discussion last night. An unfavourable outcome could jeopardise the
Scottish boat's second place. Results:
Race 4 -- 1, Danish Blue, Poul Richard Hoj Jensen (Burnham); 2,
Playback, Keith Lawrence (Gourock); 3, Katemba, Tim Law (Cowes); 4,
Yes!, Adam Gosling (Cowes); 5, Fiona IV, Richard Geaves (Burnham).
Overall (no discards) -- 1, Katemba, 8.5 points; 2, Playback, 10; 3,
Danish Blue, 13; 4, Jessica, Richard Power, 36; 5, Fiona IV, 37. (All
results provisional, subject to protest).

CIDER is the apple in the eye of the British drinker these days with
industry volume rising 8% to 100 million gallons last year, equivalent
to 7[1/2]% of the beer market, and with little sign of any let-up.
That is in stark contrast to the fortunes of the brewers who are
seeing overall level pegging and who are also hard hit by the Calais
effect of cheap booze being imported -- foreign ciders do not appeal to
the British palate and so present little threat to Bulmer and Taunton as
the industry leaders.
Taunton saw pre-tax profits dip last year by 3% to #19.8m despite a 7%
sales increase to #134m. Profits are struck before #4m of restructuring
costs which will help reduce overall expenses by #7.5m annually as from
next year, equivalent to a 20% fall in unit costs accompanied by a 30%
gain in productivity.
However, the pre-tax figure contains a #500,000 charge for the initial
stages of becoming the sole UK distributor for Miller Genuine Draft
which should become a serious profits contributor in perhaps three years
time.
Taunton's own cider volumes rose 15% to about 34 million gallons but
prices fell by 3% on average helped in part to the change in mix with a
greater emphasis in the year on the economy and own-label end of the
market.
However,it has used its market strength to put pressure on the smaller
players such as Merrydown and Inches and now chief executive Peter Adams
reckons that prices are now stabilising and should be able to be
advanced in the high volume areas.
The two-year price war is now over as prices cannot go any lower, he
added.
Overall margins fell from 16% to 14.6% because of the change in mix
and also higher apple juice costs. Unlike Bulmer which is exclusively a
home-grown apple cider-maker, Taunton imports most of its requirements
from Normandy and pays in Deutschmarks.
Dry Blackthorn raised volume by 11% and is now being boosted by Rab C
Nesbit on television as part of an overall cider promotion spend of #17m
-- Miller is costing Taunton half of #5.5m -- Miller picks up the other
50%.
However, the real money is in packaged cider where Diamond White has
built up a commanding lead with 30% of the sector and is being backed up
by Diamond Ice and Fres which is a relatively low-alcohol product aimed
at the female drinker possibly bored with white wine.
Mr Adams said the Scottish market has shown less buoyancy than the
south of England but that reflected in it not having suffered the depths
of recession.
Blackthorn has a 70% share in Scotland because it is a straightforward
alternative to lager whereas Bulmer's Strongbow with 14% is arguably too
sweet for some.
Profits this year should reach about #22m which would leave the shares
at 179p trading at 13 times likely earnings. After a bumpy experience
earlier this year which saw them down to 128p, a period of reasonable
performance lies ahead.
The dividend total has been raised 6% to 7p with a 4.2p final for a
4.9% yield.

THE likelihood that Celtic will be included in the preliminary round
of the European Cup-winners' Cup -- they should know today -- will mean
that they will have to abandon plans to meet Liverpool at Parkhead on
August 10, the day the Merseyside club had planned to give their #8.5m
record signing, Stan Collymore, his first appearance in an Anfield
strip.
A UEFA spokesperson said yesterday that the seedings and list of teams
who would be included in the preliminary rounds of the Champions' Cup
should be known today, but it seems certain that the Parkhead club, like
Rangers in the Champions' League as well as Motherwell and Raith Rovers
in the UEFA Cup, will have to play in the preliminaries.
The date set for the second leg of the Cup-winners' Cup tie is the
same as provisionally arranged for Celtic to welcome Liverpool to their
new stadium.
A Parkhead spokesperson said that the decision as to what would happen
to the Liverpool friendly in those circumstances had not yet been taken
-- ''the game would either have to be rescheduled or cancelled.''
Celtic's first game at their new stadium will be against Newcastle
United on August 5, if permisson is granted by the SFA, which is
normally a formality.
Meanwhile, midfield man John Collins, who returns form holiday today,
will have talks with manager Tommy Burns tomorrow, but it is not
expected there will be any decisions made about his future at this
stage. Two English clubs, Middlesbrough and Queen's Park Rangers, have
made offers of around #2.2m, but that is below manager Tommy Burns'
asessment.
In any case, Burns is not likely to entertain any bid for Collins
unless he has been successful in the transfer market himself. The player
still has a year of his contract left at Parkhead.

<HEADLINE>Murray Johnstone aims to befirst with new venture trust</HEADLINE>

GLASGOW-based investment management house Murray Johnstone's proposed
#30m Murray VCT fund looks likely to be the first venture capital trust
launched under legislation announced in last November's Budget, which
offers investors tax breaks.
Murray Johnstone, which plans to launch its new trust on September 12,
believes it will pip Newcastle-based Northern Venture Managers at the
post, to be the first in the UK with the new-style venture capital
trust.
With the possible exception of London-based smaller companies
specialist Baronsmead, most other potential venture capital trust
candidates appear to be sitting on the fence. They will no doubt watch
the progress of Murray VCT with interest.
Announcing details of the new trust yesterday, Murray Johnstone
director Iain Tulloch said: ''We will be first, which is a great feather
in the cap for Scotland and Glasgow. It is a very exciting project and I
shall invest in it myself.''
With a minimum subscription of #5,000, Murray VCT is probably not an
investment for widows and orphans.
However, Mr Tulloch, while acknowledging that it is a higher-risk
investment than Government stocks, does not consider it ''very
high-risk''.
He emphasised that the 40 smaller, largely unquoted companies which
would ultimately make up the portfolio would be at different stages of
development and spread across various industrial and service sectors.
Murray Johnstone believes its network of regional offices, which
covers Manchester, Birmingham, and London and will soon take in South
Yorkshire, will prove an invaluable source of deal flow.
Investors in Murray VCT will be exempt from income tax on dividends
and from capital gains tax on disposal of shares.
Unlike investment trusts, venture capital trusts can distribute
realised capital profits.
As the trust matures, Mr Tulloch believes this provision could produce
a high yield for investors if, for example, Murray VCT sells a
successful investment for cash.
Murray VCT can provide finance for management buy-outs and buy-ins, or
for expansion, as well as earlier stage capital.
Its portfolio will be focused on unquoted companies, although Murray
VCT could subscribe to a company and introduce it to the
recently-launched Alternative Investment Market.
Murray VCT, which will initially invest its assets mainly in
Government and other fixed-interest stocks, money market instruments or
cash deposits, aims within three years to be 80%-invested in companies
with strong potential for capital and income growth.
Venture capital funds comprise about #300m of the #4300m which Murray
Johnstone manages.
* UNDERVALUED Assets Trust, which is run by Edinburgh-based Scottish
Value Management, is following up its outperformance of the stock market
during its first year with a #20m placing and #10m open offer.
The investment trust's net assets grew from #51.6m to #57.9m in the 13
months from its admission to the Stock Exchange on April 27 last year.
Its existing shares, issued at 100p, are trading around 109p.
Undervalued Assets aims to achieve long-term capital growth through
investment in UK listed equities which the fund's managers consider to
be undervalued.
* SHARP falls in share prices in the emerging markets of the Far East
have taken their toll on Abtrust New Dawn.
Undiluted net asset value of the #94m investment trust declined by
14.5% to 218.43p in the year to April 30.
But shareholders have the consolation that big dividend increases by
the companies in which the trust invests have pushed earnings per share
up from 1.74p to 2.21p.
A proposed final dividend of 1.15p a share represents an increase of
28% on the special interim of 0.90p paid in respect of the previous
year.

ALEC Stewart will put up with the pain as England try to reproduce
their Lord's masterplan over the next five days.
The opener, wicketkeeper, and vice-captain has declared himself fit
for third Test battle, even though his badly bruised right index finger
is still causing some discomfort.
But wild horses would struggle to pull Stewart away from Edgbaston . .
. and that same mood of determination can be seen running right through
the England team.
They knew that they were capable of beating the West Indies. Now,
after that fabulous 72-run win at Lord's, their sights are firmly set on
the greater glory of a series victory which would end 25 years of
Caribbean domination.
''I certainly think we can win here (and take a 2-1 lead) if we
produce a similar level of performance and commitment,'' said captain
Mike Atherton. ''Lord's was a game we had to get something out of and I
feel very much the same about this one.''
Stewart's availability is a big plus. Without him, England would have
been forced to tear up the second Test script. As it is, their Edgbaston
squad looks even stronger, given Jason Gallian's ability to bat anywhere
in the top six and Mike Watkinson's all-round skills.
''I'm still aware of the injury but it's not bad enough to stop me
playing,'' said Stewart.
It will be interesting to see how the West Indies react to recent
events. In the space of a week they have lost at Lord's, sent Winston
Benjamin home in disgrace on ''discipline and fitness grounds'', and
been thrashed by Sussex.
Even so, the bookmakers still make them narrow favourites at
Edgbaston. ''We need to be a bit more focused and concentrate on
occupation of the crease,'' said tour manager Wes Hall.
England (from) -- M A Atherton (captain), A J Stewart (wicketkeeper),
G A Hick, G P Thorpe, R A Smith, J E R Gallian, D G Cork, D Gough, P J
Martin, R K Illingworth, A R C Fraser, M Watkinson.
West Indies (probable) -- C L Hooper, S L Campbell, B C Lara, J C
Adams, R B Richardson (captain), K L T Arthurton, J R Murray
(wicketkeeper), I R Bishop, C E L Ambrose, K C G Benjamin, C A Walsh.

LENNOX Lewis is reportedly being wooed to the tune of #20m by an
American pay TV channel to take part in a #116m tournament alongside
seven other fighters not under contract to Don King.
These include Evander Holyfield, WBO champion Riddick Bowe and
possibly Britain's Herbie Hide.
He would fight a maximum of three bouts, starting with Tommy Morrison
in London in the autumn. If the seedings worked out, the Briton would
meet Bowe in the final in June next year.
Other fighters tipped to feature in the tournament are Michael Moorer,
George Foreman and Ray Mercer.

SAINSBURY, Britain's biggest food retailer, continues to show that it
is losing out in the battle for growth in what remains one of the most
competitive trading sectors in the UK.
Speaking at the company's annual general meeting, David Sainsbury,
chairman and chief executive, said that current trading showed
like-for-like sales growth averaging just 2%, a deterioration from the
first two months of Sainsbury's current financial year.
This compares poorly with the 7% growth recorded at Tesco and the
striking 8.4% sales rise at the revitalised Asda, the best performance
of the top five food retailers.
As one City analyst pointed out, like-for-like sales of 2% compared
with 2.3% for the first eight weeks of 1995-96 implies that volume
growth has fallen a further 0.3% to a negative 0.5%, assuming food price
inflation of 2.5%.
The company has embarked on a marketing initiative which Mr Sainsbury
said should help to boost sales in the first half. Sainsbury said its
supermarket prices are about 3% below the average of other major
retailers and the company intends to maintain that price advantage.
Only two new supermarkets are being opened in the first half compared
with 15 new stores opened during the same period last year. The chairman
said that the recently acquired Texas DIY stores would make a loss in
the first half but that the position should improve in the second half,
giving rise to a small operating profit for the year. Sainsbury's
Homebase DIY business continues to perform strongly with underlying
sales up almost 5%.
The Savacentre hypermarkets and Shaw's in the US are said to be
performing in line with last year.
Sainsbury shares ended up 2p to 453p although earlier in the day they
had dropped 7p.

ABERDEEN-registered Pentex Oil yesterday announced the commissioning
of a three-megawatt gas-fired power generation plant at its operational
base at Gainsborough in the East Midlands. Electricity from the plant
will be used by Pentex and also sold to Yorkshire Electricity.
The start-up of the facility marks the completion of its #1.25m first
phase. Pentex said additional net revenues arising from the sale of
power and reduced requirement to buy in electricity would exceed
#600,000 per annum.
Phases two and three, which Pentex expects to complete by July next
year, will treble the plant's generating capability. The scheme is
expected to have a 14-year life.

IT could be said that Goran Ivanisevic had a smashing time on the
Centre Court yesterday, and having done so the Croat set himself up for
a men's singles semi-final against champion Pete Sampras tomorrow.
It was all to do with Ivanisevic destroying a racket. He believes that
the action brought him luck -- and he has no intention of stopping now.
The powerful-serving Ivanisevic proved his point when he hit the
ground in frustration during his 7-5, 7-6, 6-3 quarter-final win over
Russian Yevgeni Kafelnikov.
His racket buckled under the pressure and he said: ''I was surprised
how easily I broke it. Maybe there was something wrong with the racket.
Or maybe I'm too strong.'' Ivanisevic picked up a new racket, won the
point, then the set.
''For the last couple of months, every time I broke a racket I won a
game or set. So every time I'm going to break a racket if it's going to
bring me luck.
''It's not nice for the racket company but they have to understand. I
have to talk to them. I was pretty nice to the racket for two weeks and
then it's gone, it's history. But it's OK. I won.''
Kafelnikov, too, was history after Ivanisevic sent 33 aces hurtling
past him to set up a re-match of last year's final -- often described as
one of Wimbledon's worst.
And Ivanisevic warned that the ''replay'' will be as serve-dominated
as last year's final. ''If I serve good and he serves good there's going
to be a lot of aces, a couple of break points, and whoever takes the
first chance is going to come out a winner.''
Ivanisevic saved four set points against him to clinch a second set
tie-break 13-11 after Kafelnikov missed a crucial backhand volley.
Earlier on Court No.1, Sampras came back from a set down to solve the
puzzle posed by Japan's Shuzo Matsuoka. But the man ranked 108th in the
world before Wimbledon often made his American opponent look less than
convincing.
Sampras eventually shrugged off the setback of going behind in a
first-set tie-break to beat Matsuoka 6-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. But it was a
long time before he could get his usual serve-and-volley game in top
gear.
The American had Matsuoka, the first Japanese player to reach the
quarter-finals in the open era, on the ropes but made hard work of
knocking out the 27-year-old from Tokyo, who was struggling with a
pulled stomach muscle for which he had acupuncture treatment before the
start.
''I've got to improve my serve -- maybe 15 or 20%,'' said the
champion. ''But it was not a case of being over-confident here. I just
got a bit careless at times, although Shuzo played some great shots.''
The Japanese, who was beaten in two sets by Sampras at Queen's Club
last month, ran him too close for comfort until he finally committed too
many errors.
''The crowd are always going to root for the underdog,'' said Sampras,
''but I know I've just got to stay solid to win matches like these. I
broke his serve in the first game so there could not have been any
sluggishness in my start. The trouble was I didn't bear down on him from
that position.''
Matsuoka said: ''I thought Pete was pretty nervous at the start, but
when he started playing much better in the third and fourth sets, there
was nothing I could do.''
In the mixed doubles, British interest came to an end when Mark
Petchey and Clare Wood were beaten in a quarter-final.
The pair, bidding to become the first British Wimbledon winners since
Jeremy Bates and Jo Durie won the mixed in 1987, were beaten 6-2, 7-6 by
Canadian Grant Connell and Lindsay Davenport of the USA on Centre Court.
Wood and Petchey were broken in the first set, and despite the keen
backing of the home supporters failed to take advantage of their only
break point of the match, on the Davenport serve, in the second.
The British duo were a break up in the tie-break but then lost six
successive points as the second seeds proved too strong.
Martin Lee lived up to his growing reputation by powering through to
the last eight of the boys' singles.
The 17-year-old left-hander overcame the challenge of another
big-server, Peter Wessels (Holland), 6-3, 7-6 to claim a date with third
seed Alejandro Hernandez, of Mexico.
''I'd played the guy four times and never beaten him so I was very
pleased with my game,'' said Lee.
Lee and partner James Trotman are already in the second round of the
doubles. But another British pair, Warwickshire's Jamie Delgado and
Kent's Alex Osterrieth, failed to reach that stage when they were beaten
3-6, 7-5, 6-2 by the third seeds, Germany's Tommy Haas and American Greg
Hill.

CALEDONIAN Media Communications (CMC) made encouraging progress last
year.
The company was formed at the beginning of this year by the
acquisition of the established cable operator Devanha Group by Worth
Investment Trust.
Turnover in the continuing operations of Devanha Group for the full
year rose by 2% to just under #10m. The pre-tax loss increased to
#678,000 from #392,000.
CMC has a licence to provide cable services in Aberdeen and Coventry.
The churn rate, the level at which people leave the network, was below
the industry average at 24.7% in Aberdeen but rose to almost 41% in
Coventry, reflecting the strict control of bad debt.
The company differs from the other quoted cable operators in its
structure, its radio network and the fact that its network is leased
from BT over 99 years. This means that it does not have the huge capital
requirements for laying its own cable network. It also does not have a
direct salesforce cold-calling potential subscribers to its cable
service.
It is largely marketed through retail outlets and newspapers and has a
policy of going for quality subscribers rather than quantity, therefore
growth in subscriber numbers is unlikely to power ahead.
Alongside its cable business the company is keen to develop a
telephony service. At the end of March it acquired Atlantic
Telecommunications which was established four years ago to develop
telecommunications services using fixed access radio-based technology.
This pioneering technology will allow the deployment of a
state-of-the-art digital communications network using frequencies
without the need for underground construction.
Atlantic has received a public telecommunications operator licence for
Glasgow City and the Strathclyde Region. A trial project involving 30
homes in Glasgow is due to commence at the end of the year. If
successful, the service will be launched elsewhere.
Executive chairman and 29% shareholder, Graham Duncan expects the
telephony business to grow faster than cable television, although he has
no wish to emulate BT. The service will be aimed at high residential
users and small and medium-size local businesses. However, investment
continues to be made in the cable business.
Mr Duncan is a firm believer in local programming although this can be
prohibitively expensive to provide round the clock. Caledonian Media
offers local programmes in Aberdeen and Coventry, provided largely by
volunteers, community groups and media groups. It is currently in
discussions with Grampian on local programming.
Caledonian Media Communications intends to grow in a measured way in
its niche markets, offering a distinctive blend of cable television,
telephony and multimedia services. Mr Duncan is confident that there is
a lot of value to come out of its cable and telephony interests.
Shares in Caledonian Media remained at 29p compared with an issue
price in January of 24p. They are likely to be held back by the prospect
of a cash-call on shareholders some time this year.

THE new rules governing the sale of elderly people's homes proved to
be a financial nightmare for one couple caring for a relative.
On the advice of a social worker, Morton and Helen Wishart arranged a
loan to buy the East Kilbride council house where Mrs Wishart's mother,
Mrs Nellie Berry, stayed.
They believed they would be able to recover all the money spent on
buying and upgrading the building.
However, Mrs Berry suffered a stroke and was diagnosed as suffering
from dementia.
She was transferred from Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride to the
Salvation Army Eventide Home in Milton of Campsie.
Ten months later, the family was informed that Mrs Berry would have to
be removed as she owed the home more than #4000.
A stay of eviction was obtained, but Strathclyde Regional Council
ruled that under the regulations, it was required to take the capital
value of the house into account when making assessments for residential
or nursing home care.
Mrs Wishart was forced to give up her job as a secretary and to look
after her mother at home because they could not afford the residential
care bills.
Her husband has recently suffered a heart attack and she is now caring
for them both.
Mrs Wishart said simply that life was ''very difficult''.
''If I had been given the right information at the beginning, this
problem would not have arisen,'' she said.

A #3.1m refund from the Inland Revenue produced virtually all of the
seven-fold increase in Glasgow-based Quality Street's annual after-tax
profits.
Although the rented homes company's after-tax earnings leapt from
#500,000 to #3.7m in the 12 months to end-March, pre-tax profits of
#507,000 were only about #100,000 higher than the previous year.
Turnover was up 19% at #16.2m.
Chairman Paul Mugnaioni sees great potential in the UK private rented
sector, which he expects to double in size to account for 20% of the
overall housing market within the next 20 years.
Quality Street's tax refund, which is related to index-linked payments
on borrowings, was the driving force behind a 75% increase in net assets
to #11.2m.
The company, a subsidiary of Nationwide, manages about 4500 properties
throughout the UK, of which it owns about 2500. Monthly rents range from
about #330 to #2500.
In Scotland, it owns slightly more than 1000 properties and manages
another 500.
Last month, Quality Street launched its Fountainside development in
Hamilton, which comprises 18 two-bedroom apartments. Early in the New
Year, it hopes to open a 20-flat development in Stirling.
During the year to end-March, Quality Street invested more than #2m in
new rented homes.
It also upgraded 1600 properties throughout the UK for 20 Business
Expansion Scheme companies. Quality Street believes the development of
such project management activities is creating a more balanced business.
The private rented sector is also likely to benefit from the
Government's recently-published White Paper on housing, which includes
proposals for grant-funding of private sector provision of social
housing.
The White Paper also covers Housing Authorised Investment Trusts,
which would provide tax breaks for individuals and institutions wishing
to invest in the private rented sector.
Even if the UK's private rented sector does double in size during the
next 20 years, Mr Mugnaioni believes it will still be the smallest in
Europe.

<HEADLINE>Scottish firms fear devolution. Report's findings in contrast to views of multinationals</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A FORMER director of Locate in Scotland who rejected claims that
political devolution would frighten inward investment away from Scotland
has said indigenous companies are much more fearful of devolution and
its impact on their business.
Professor Neil Hood of the International Business Unit at Strathclyde
University said that in contrast to multinational companies, some
Scottish firms are uncertain and untrusting of devolution.
Writing in the latest Fraser of Allander Institute's quarterly
economic commentary, he says some major companies fear a Scottish
Assembly would have higher spending and tax-raising powers which would
affect business costs and returns.
Some also believe the ''inexperience of policy-makers'' and the
''narrow-mindedness of some of the likely factions'' in a Scottish
parliament would not help their business interests.
Professor Hood's findings -- based on responses by about 20 prominent
people in Scottish business and public life to a paper on inward
investment and devolution -- will come as a blow to the Labour Party,
which has been making strenuous efforts to forge closer links with the
business community.
His paper, which said there was no prima facie case for claiming
devolution as proposed would have a negative effect on inward
investment, was circulated earlier this year.
Although it focussed on inward investment, Professor Hood says
respondents' comments were mainly concerned with the potential impact on
major indigenous businesses and were founded on the expectation that it
would be very difficult for any government to stay within the remit of
devolutionary powers as presently specified.
He says the comments included the claim that the imposition of
political risk and uncertainty above the norm, such as in the context of
devolution, ''takes business into a territory with which they are
naturally less comfortable'', adding that this in itself was seen to
call for dialogue and persuasive argument to reduce uncertainty.
Another important concern related to the importance of UK cost
competitiveness, both for indigenous and international businesses.
''The view was expressed that even if devolution did not lean towards
independence, it could, if further spending powers were to be vested in
a Scottish parliament, progressively lead to higher spending, thus
affecting business costs and returns.
''The underlying assumption in this set of comments was that more
localised government for Scotland would find it difficult to preserve
the environment within which the UK competitiveness has improved over
the past decade.''
Professor Hood, who ran LIS between 1987 and 1989, says the paper
elicited a number of different evaluations about the political
complexion of a devolved parliament.
These included the belief that, irrespective of the policy platform on
which devolution was introduced, there would be ''a substantial number
of radical members whose past rhetoric was critical of multinational
enterprises (MNEs) and that could ultimately change the inward
investment climate in Scotland.''
He adds that another recurring theme was that of the ''inexperience of
policy-makers in matters relating to the maintenance of a competitive
environment in Scotland and the implicit commitment to spending
programmes which would require more tax-raising powers.
''In its more extreme form, comment on this general theme focussed on
the potential narrow-mindedness of some of the factions in a Scottish
parliament which would not be supportive of business interests in
general and which might over-react to restructuring within MNEs in
particular.''
Professor Hood says that most of these comments came from indigenous
business leaders and that, in contrast, senior managers of MNEs were
broadly supportive of his arguments, stating that devolution would not
exert a major influence on their activities.
Commenting on reaction to the report, Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson said yesterday: ''I very much share the concern expressed
within the survey that there is a need for dialogue in order to reduce
some of the uncertainties surrounding Labour's plans,'' adding that this
was why the party had established the Scottish Industry Forum to forge
closer links with business.
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, claimed the
strong concerns of the business community vindicated the party's
argument that devolution would be an economic disaster for Scotland.
* THE FAI's quarterly economic commentary notes that, despite recent
weakening in the performance of the production and construction
industries, the Scottish economy remains on an upward trend.
It says that output growth continues to be strong but is expected to
slacken next year, as net export growth weakens. With unemployment
continuing to fall, the Scottish and British labour markets remain
buoyant, but only partly because of job creation.
The commentary adds that the continuation of the recovery in Scotland
and the UK depends crucially on the prospects for investment, continued
net export growth, and the extent of the threat of accelerating
inflation.

IRISH OPEN
THE Shark has pretty teeth . . . and a pretty wife and pretty children
and pretty healthy bank balance. What Greg Norman, the biggest
money-winner of all time, does not have is a tournament victory in
Ireland.
This, without being bombastic, he has every intention of rectifying
when the Murphy's Irish Open gets underway this morning at Mount Juliet.
The Irish, and particularly the sponsors who are reported to have paid
Norman a fee of #233,000 just for turning up, are delighted with him --
his black hat hovers over advertising hoardings up and down the country.
If there was a popular vote to award the #108,330 first prize, the Shark
would snap it up.
But, as Norman knows only too well, golf is a fickle master. There is
a total of #650,000 to be won here plus points that can go towards a
Ryder Cup blazer.
Bernhard Langer, defending champion, and current leader of the chase
for cup places, is one who will certainly not be waving the white flag.
Also, spare a thought for Sandy Lyle. The big Scot is desperate to
reappear in the European team, having been an absentee since 1987.
Last week, after having shot a course record-breaking 64 in the BMW
International tournament in Munich he felt the old tingle returning --
whereupon he was promptly disqualified for signing a wrong scorecard in
the previous round.
Lyle did not even enter the Irish. ''I was looking forward to a rest
before the Scottish and the Open. But, after last week's 'early bath' in
Germany, I jumped at the chance when Murphy's gave me a sponsor's
invite.
Ian Woosnam, twice an Irish Open winner, told us he did not want to be
in the Ryder Cup team if he was not playing well. ''But I am playing
better now and my confidence is improving.''
Controversially, Woosnam believes captain Bernard Gallacher should
have more choices than the two he has. ''I would give him at least
four,'' he said.

A FALL close to the finish cost Frenchman Laurent Jalabert the lead in
the Tour de France yesterday, the leader's yellow jersey now being worn
by the little-known, Ivan Gotti.
The Italian, 26, riding his first Tour and without a career win to his
name, was second overnight, and Jalabert's accident on the fourth stage
gave him the coveted jersey he surely never dreamed he would wear.
Italian sprinter specialist Mario Cipollini won the stage over 101
miles from Alencon to Le Havre, having sprinted to victory in the second
stage to Vitre on Monday.
Yesterday's drama happened as the field were heading serenely towards
a bunch finish. A rider from the Lotto team, leading the pelaton,
sustained a puncture which caused him to crash into barriers.
He brought down a few riders immediately behind him, including
Jalabert, Wilfried Nelissen, the Belgian who collided with Jalabert in a
serious crash during last year's Tour, and Hendrik Redant, who suffered
facial injuries.
Jalabert was unhurt and got back on his bike to come in 50secs behind
the main bunch which included Gotti, who had been trailing by only eight
seconds after his Gewiss Ballan team won Tuesday's team time trial.
''I'm very happy to get the yellow jersey but I hope Jalabert is not
hurt,'' Gotti said.
''I hope Jalabert was not badly hurt,'' he said. ''I would have liked
to take the yellow jersey another way. Now I hope I can pass it on to
our team leader Yevgeny Berzin in Sunday's time trial.'' Placings

STEPHEN Wright joined Rangers yesterday in a deal in which the value
will be settled by a tribunal, and the move must leave Aberdeen
supporters wondering about their club's ambition.
For 24-year-old Wright admitted that he had never been offered a
re-signing deal by the Pittodrie club, even though they have recently
valued the player at #2.5m.
Wright, who joined Aberdeen as a teenager and has spent his career
there, said at Ibrox: ''Aberdeen never made me any kind of offer to
stay. I was left wondering what my future would be. It surprised me that
there was no effort to keep me at Pittodrie.''
That remains a problem for Aberdeen, who have several other
out-of-contract players worrying over what happens next to them.
Wright's future, though, is assured. He has signed for Rangers and all
that has to be sorted out is the transfer fee.
I understand that the Ibrox club, resigned to a transfer tribunal,
have made an official bid for the player. That is understood to be
around #1m, and half of that proposed fee already has been lodged with
the Scottish League to comply with the rules governing transfers
conducted under tribunal rules.
Aberdeen, of course, have already suggested that #2.5m is their
probable benchmark for the player and they may try to hold out for that.
However, there were no signs yesterday of the club's intentions.
No-one has informed Rangers what size of fee they might require for the
transfer, and with Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken on holiday, no
negotiations have been possible -- hence the acceptance of a tribunal
decision.
Rangers manager Walter Smith said: ''We are happy to add a player of
Stephen's ability to the squad. But we cannot say anything about a
transfer deal until we have spoken to Aberdeen. We have gone through the
procedures which will take us to a tribunal, and that is what we
anticipate will happen.''
Wright, who has won Under-21 honours and full Scotland caps, is
convinced that he had made the right decision. ''I have been
disappointed with the fact that I have not won more Scotland caps,'' he
said, ''and maybe moving to a club as big as Rangers will help me
achieve my ambitions.
''First of all, though, I know that I have to get into the first team
and stay there. It is not easy to come to a club with as many top
internationalists and expect to walk into the team. I have to earn my
place and if I do that then other things will follow.
''I was given the chance last night and I did not hesitate. This is
the kind of move which any player would want to make.''
* HEARTS striker John Robertson claims that he has been offered a
package for the new season that is worth less than the deal he signed
three years ago.
''I'm not being greedy,'' said the Scottish internationalist.
''However, I certainly cannot accept this latest offer.''
The biggest sticking point for the player could centre on a signing-on
fee after Dave McPherson and Jim Bett were well looked after when
joining the Tynecastle club last season.

SBC WARBURG again emerged as overall winner for the fourth year
running in the 22nd Extel annual survey of investment analysts, with its
12.09% of votes just pipping NatWest Securities' 11.82%.
That is some consolation to the former SG Warburg whose absorption by
the Swiss Banking Corporation is leading to 1000 job losses this month
out of a total combined staff payroll of 11,000.
Warburg scored because of its international research activities with
NatWest being the overall winner for UK equities. They both lie ahead of
BZW at 10.5% and James Capel HSBC at 10.2%, while in fifth place is
Kleinwort Benson's 9.7% and sixth Smith New Court with 8.8%.
Extel approached 200 fund managers and 127 responded, representing
funds totalling #940bn.
As usual 80% of managers read less than half the research material
they receive. Also 25% of analysts have had less than two years'
experience which accounts for many fund managers finding that the
quality of research varies substantially in any one firm.
Also there is increasing concentration with many funds using a smaller
number of brokers.
The top analyst was Steve Plag who covers pharmaceuticals, healthcare
and household goods for NatWest, while his colleagues in the oil sector
picked up the team award.
One highly-successful fund manager who has consistently refused to
participate said to be a winner is obviously good news for the
individual analyst. But it would be more useful if the accuracy of
forecasts over a year could be measured as he certainly does not share
the consensus views about the two winning firms.
After the presentation in London's Guildhall, there were some grim
faces as a fall in the ratings puts jobs in jeopardy.

INVESTORS hoping for early payouts from the Investors' Compensation
Scheme (ICS) are in for a disappointment as a result of a High Court
ruling which will have the effect of freezing payments possibly for
several months to come.
Set up by the Securities and Investments Board, the ICS is the
umbrella scheme for the financial services industry. Its funds are
contributed by the various regulatory organisations but the vast bulk
comes from the Personal Investment Authority (PIA) and most of the
payouts derive from the failure of independent financial advisers which
have to be members of the PIA.
Sun Life, a member of the PIA, has challenged the obligation of
members to contribute to the scheme and yesterday received the go-ahead
from the High Court for a judicial review which will start on August 23.
The contribution of #13.8m due from the PIA which the ICS had budgeted
for will not be received pending the outcome of the review. Normally the
scheme pays out an average of #2m a month and these payments will have
to cease for the time being, leaving investors in the lurch.
The ICS is able to pay compensation up to #48,000 for losses sustained
by the failure of advisers, investment managers and others holding
investor funds.
Sun Life came into the PIA as a result of the authority's absorption
of Fimbra, the regulator for financial advisers, and Lautro, which was
the watchdog for life companies and unit trust managers.

SCOTTISH ASSISTANTS
TORRENTIAL rain delayed play for nearly an hour in the second round of
the Scottish Assistants Championship at Newmachar yesterday but it did
not dampen the spirits of Cawder's Alan Tait as he added a level-par 72
to his opening 69 to move into a two-stroke lead.
Cruden Bay's assistant Ian Bratton emerged as main challenger,
equalling the lowest score of the day with a two-under-par 70 across the
Dave Thomas-designed course to finish two strokes adrift.
David Herd, of Alloa, matched that score with only 25 putts and
several ''Houdini-like'' escapes.
Defending champion Scott Henderson, of King's Links, rolled in a
20-foot birdie putt on the final green to add the finishing touches to a
lacklustre one-over-par 73 to sit six shots off the lead. Leading
scores:
141 -- A Tait (Cawder) 69, 72. 143 -- I Bratton (Cruden Bay) 73, 70.
145 -- J McCreadie (Buchanan Castle) 73, 72. 147 -- M King (Pitreavie)
73, 74. 148 -- S Henderson (King's Links) 75, 73; J Greaves (Glasgow)
76, 72; A Locke (Banchory) 72, 76; E McIntosh (Braid Hills) 76, 72. 149

YOUNG families and people of all ages who enjoy a fun day out may well
be familiar with Calderglen Country Park in East Kilbride. What they
might not know is that the existing facilities -- the visitor centre,
children's zoo, adventure play areas, ornamental gardens and nature
trails -- have been further enhanced with the opening last week of a
unique attraction -- the Conservatory -- and a new cafe.
The Conservatory, with its constantly controlled temperature and
humidity, provides an opportunity to see plants and animals from all
corners of the world in an environment that is pleasant whatever the
weather -- and, like the rest of the District Council facilities at the
park, it's free.
Covering more than 600 sq m, the purpose-built Conservatory is next to
the existing ornamental garden, forming an impressive centrepiece for
the park. As well as a stunning display of plants from five continents,
including banana trees, desert cactuses, coffee bushes and the striking
South American bromeliad tree, it is home to a number of marmosets
(small monkeys) and marine and freshwater fish. There will also be
changing themed displays including exotic frogs and reptiles like the
boa constrictor.
There is a wet wall, which provides a moist habitat for a wide variety
of ferns and mosses, and a waterfall leading to a raised pool, with
viewing window from which to watch the aquatic life.
The park's close links with the local community will be boosted by the
Conservatory, which has a large block-paved area where the in-house
horticultural, zoo, and ranger staff will be on hand to advise on
gardening, pet care, and the environment.
In addition, a wide range of practical demonstrations, seminars and
workshops will be run to extend the already busy programme. This Sunday
is sheep and wool day -- first held successfully last year with One Man
and his Dog-type sheep dog trials, traditional shearing, spinning and
weaving demonstrations, and other farm-related activities and crafts. A
mini-beast safari, night hike, natural history photography workshop, and
international bog day/animal magic events are planned for subsequent
Sundays in July.
The Conservatory and its catering facilities are available to local
groups and organisations for meetings of up to 50 people, and for hire
in the evenings by private businesses and for functions.
Spending a full day at Calderglen allows the visitor to fully enjoy
the many facilities on offer, from the beauty and tranquillity of the
leafy walks to the bustling activity of the children's play areas. And
if you want to relax with a cup of tea and a sandwich or perhaps
something more substantial, there is a wide range of hot and cold meals
available at the new Courtyard Cafe.
Created in the former starter's office of Torrance House municipal
golf course, it too will be linked to many of the park's events
programmes. For example, visitors going on the dawn chorus walk at 4am
will be able to have breakfast afterwards.
''The park has really developed over the past 10 years,'' said council
leader Colin Robb. ''It is special because of its proximity to East
Kilbride, but what it lacked until now was a unique visitor attraction
and facilities for inclement weather. It was also felt that there were
no facilities, apart from a fast-food van in the car park, for visitors
to enjoy a coffee and baguette or a meal. The district council took this
on board and provided funding. With the Conservatory we have tried to
create, with our own design and landscape staff, something unique in the
way we have planted it out.''
The visitor centre is open throughout the year. It includes audio
visual and history rooms, a gallery, souvenir shop and the unique Hidden
Worlds wildlife experience.
The children's zoo has a varied collection of animals, including
wallabies, goats, guinea pigs, rabbits and owls. Younger children will
love the scramble nets, chutes and climbing frames, while the more
demanding adventure play area will provide hours of fun for older ones.
Calderglen Country Park can be reached by bus -- there's a regular
service from East Kilbride town centre to within five minutes' walk of
the park; by car -- the main entrance is on the A726 Strathaven road,
and by train -- a regular service runs from Glasgow to East Kilbride,
with a connecting bus from the town.
For further information on Calderglen, its events, or to book an
assisted group visit, telephone 013552 36644 during visitor centre
opening hours, which are 10.30am to 5pm Monday to Friday and 11.30am to
6.30pm Saturday, Sunday and public holidays in the summer.

BIDDERS for the trust port of Dundee, who learned yesterday whether
they had made the shortlist in the privatisation process, had to sign a
confidentiality clause before their initial offers were considered by
Dundee Port Authority.
Apparently fearful of jeopardizing their respective positions, the
three companies who publicly declared they had submitted pre-qualifying
bids by the initial June 13 deadline would not say whether or not they
had made the short-leet.
A spokesman for one of the bidders, Leith-based Forth Ports, said:
''When bidders were invited to express their initial interest, part of
the conditions put on their initial bid being accepted was that they
signed this confidentiality thing.''
The privatisation committee at Dundee Port Authority, and its
financial adviser Binder Hamlyn, are intent on maintaining a veil of
secrecy, perhaps believing that the ultimate sale proceeds could be
affected if shortlisted bidders knew who they were up against.
Those bidders left in the running are being supplied with more
detailed financial information and have until August 4 to submit their
final offers.
Dundee Port Authority, which is working in conjunction with the
Department of Transport, expects the privatisation process to be
completed by September.
Glasgow-based Clydeport teamed up with the management of the port of
Dundee, submitting a pre-qualifying bid through a newly-created company,
Caledonian Ports.
Grimsby-based John Sutcliffe &amp; Son, a family-owned shipping company
which owns and operates the port of Boston in Lincolnshire, also
submitted an indicative offer.
Although Clydeport chairman John Mather said earlier this week that he
expected to make the shortlist, the company was yesterday remaining
tight-lipped on whether this had happened. Sutcliffe also declined to
comment.
The port of Dundee will probably fetch between #10m and #20m. There is
a feeling that competition could push the proceeds into the top half of
this range, although some analysts feel this would be a high price.
Forth Ports may have the edge when it comes to the depth of its
pockets, while Clydeport's decision to join with the management of
Dundee port may stand it in good stead.
Dundee Port Authority made pre-tax profits of #825,000 in 1993 on
turnover of #5m and moved about one million tonnes of cargo. It employs
95 people.

TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP
SCOTLAND'S amateur golfers stole the show in Belgium yesterday as they
stormed into the lead after the first qualifying round in the European
Team Championship.
Captain Colin Dalgleish could not hide his delight at the end of a day
in which his charges sat proudly at the head of the leaderboard with a
stunning five-card total of 340, 20 under par.
It put the Scots six clear of nearest challengers, Ireland, and makes
today's final qualifying round -- to establish the eight nations who
will fill the top-flight matchplay section -- almost a formality.
Leading aggregates:
340 -- Scotland (G Sherry 66, B Howard 67, S Gallacher 68, G Rankin
69, A Reid 70, H McKibbin 73, did not count);
346 -- Ireland (K Nolan 66, G Murphy 68, P Harrington 68, J Fanagan
72, G McGimpsey 72, J Morris 78, did not count).
347 -- Sweden, France.
354 -- Belgium.

THE Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of
the Bank of England, Eddie George, met yesterday for the second time
since the two men clashed over interest rates at the monetary meeting in
May.
The Bank dealt in the money markets at noon at established rates,
providing an early hint that rates had been left on hold.
The final decision on rates rests with the Chancellor, who rebuffed
the Governor when he called for an increase two months ago. But when it
is decided to change rates the timing is in the hands of Mr George.
The City does not expect another rise in rates until evidence emerges
that the economy, which has slowed down in recent months, is beginning
to pick up momentum again or as a prelude to a tax-cutting Budget.
In its monthly report the Treasury noted that net trade was very
buoyant, but investment and consumers' expenditure fell back.
''These figures reaffirm that growth has slowed to a more sustainable
but healthy rate,'' it added.
Monthly figures continued to give mixed signals with retail sales
rising in May while manufacturing output dropped back in April. CBI
output expectations fell back in June, but continued to point to healthy
output growth. Unemployment dropped by 10,000 in May.
The next monetary meeting is only three weeks away on July 27. Six
days later the Bank of England issues its quarterly inflation report.
In its last report in May, the Bank was forced to conclude that the
Government would miss its central inflation target of 2.5% or less by
the end of the current Parliament. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street
was concerned about the inflationary impact of sterling's fall from
grace this year.
The August report by the Bank will presumably repeat the warning, but
unless sterling falls further, it is unlikely that it will contain any
fresh shocks.
However, the tension between the two men will not disappear. Mr George
gave the House of Commons Select Committee on Treasury Affairs a
reminder yesterday of his credentials as the nation's inflation
watchdog.
He said that the last two months had not resolved the dilemma over
rates and that lack of commitment was the key threat to permanently low
inflation, which he defined as 2.5% or less.
The implication is that the Government's attention is focussed
elsewhere -- on keeping rates low and searching for the elusive feel
good factor through tax cuts.
He also seemed to suggest that tax reductions should be dependent on
corresponding cuts in public expenditure.
With UK rates apparently on hold for the foreseeable future the
attention of financial markets has switched to the other side of the
Atlantic where the Federal Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting
last night.
Speculation that this will result in a quarter or half a point being
trimmed off US rates has been rife, but it has been tempered by cautious
spirits warning that the signs of weakness in the American economy are
insufficient to persuade the US central bank to change course on
monetary policy.

THE defence industry has seen some hard times but for GEC, conditions
have been even tougher than analysts had expected. As a result of
problem contracts in the Marconi defence systems division, GEC's profits
rose only 3% to #891m in the year to March, which was right at the
bottom of outside estimates. So the shares fell 4p to 305p.
Some parts of the defence side did improve their results but the
division's profits were knocked back from #252m to #205m by heavy
provisions on certain programmes, which GEC says are moving towards
completion. These are thought to be the radar for Eurofighter and the
Phoenix naval sonar. Overall the order intake was up but deliveries down
and margins were lower.
In contrast to the good old days of cost-plus defence procurement,
nowadays it is the contractor who foots the bill for over-runs which can
be very great in high-technology projects.
GEC's defence interests are to be greatly enlarged with the #800m
purchase of VSEL, the Trident submarine builder. This will dent the
legendary cash pile, which at the year-end totalled #2950m, split
equally between the group and joint ventures.
Some money is locked into the joint ventures and could not be readily
realised. So it would be difficult to mobilise all the cash for a bid
for British Aerospace, said to be chief executive Lord Weinstock's
ultimate ambition, though time is running out as he is 71.
The biggest joint operation is GEC Alsthom, owned with Alcatel of
France. This is one of the world's largest power generation equipment
and railway equipment manufacturers. While it is pulling in orders at a
steady rate, its profits are static, with GEC's share at #157m. There
was a slow-down in business from the British nuclear industry.
The business needs a large cash cushion to have the muscle to bid for
massive turnkey contracts for power stations. In the year it reorganised
itself to be in a better position to compete better in what is a growth
industry given the increasing power requirements in the Asia Pacific
region and Eastern Europe for example, where orders were secured in
China, the Philippines, Pakistan, and the Czech Republic. But margins
were under pressure.
GEC Alsthom makes the trains for the Channel Tunnel, which is not such
a good advertisement given the frequency they break down. Nevertheless,
it was selected for a prime contract to supply rolling stock and
signalling for the Seoul-Pusan high-speed train. It is also going to
build and maintain a fleet of new trains for the London Underground
Northern Line -- currently dubbed the ''misery line'' in the first major
transport project under the Government's Private Finance Initiative.
Best performer was the telecommunications business, whose profits rose
23% to #148m. It is also doing well abroad, where orders rose 60% and
account for a quarter of the total. The public switching and
transmission businesses were merged to give sharper focus on customers'
needs and this helped bring in more orders. At home, cable television
companies are producing a steady stream of work for the division.
GEC has a raft of other smaller divisions and electronic metrology
stands out with more than doubled profits of #60m on the back of a
strong showing by the petrol pumps business, Gilbarco, which is world
market leader.
On the other hand, medical equipment saw a sharp decline from #54m to
#36m owing to poor market conditions, particularly in the US. The
squeeze is on healthcare costs worldwide.
Electronic components benefited from strong demand for chips and the
like so that profits jumped from #8m to #23m.
GEC is upbeat about the current year. Finance director David Newlands
said defence systems had touched bottom and appropriate action had been
taken to improve its performance. About 1000 jobs cuts are planned.
Orders are on the way up, standing at #4900m against #4500m a year ago,
included in total group orders of #12.7b, including GEC's share of joint
ventures. A recovery in profits for the division is clearly expected
this year.
Mr Newlands is confident that the power generation business has good
prospects, pointing to letters of intent for 12,000 MW of plant. It is
hoped that much of these will turn into firm orders during the next year
to 18 months.
GEC will undoubtedly make more money this year, though integration
benefits from VSEL will take time to come through. Nevertheless
fireworks are as unlikely as ever -- bar an out of the blue bid for
British Aerospace which is highly unlikely -- and the shares, selling at
almost 15 times earnings and yielding 4.6p on dividends 5% higher at
11.37p after a final of 8.4p, have no particular attractions.

THERE was some welcome good news from the retail sector yesterday with
Dixons, Britain's largest electricals retailer, reporting annual profits
ahead of expectations.
The company, with 15% market share, managed to capitalise on the
weakness of its major competitor Comet and the cutbacks seen in various
retailing operations of the regional electricity companies of England
and Wales.
It has also benefited from growth in demand for home computers all of
which enabled the group headed by Stanley Kalms to report profits at
#100.3m before tax. That compares very favourably with last year's
profit of #73.3m before tax and exceptional charges.
The strong performance was reflected in the dividend which goes up by
11% to 5.45p taking the total dividend to 7.25p, an increase of 10%. A
scrip alternative is available in lieu of the final dividend.
The outlook for the current year appears encouraging. Mr Kalms said
retail sales in the first nine weeks were 7% ahead of the same period
last year, in underlying terms, with gross margins stable. ''With the
present outlook for the UK economy, we look forward with confidence to a
year of further growth,'' he said.
The retail division made its highest ever operating profit of #90.5m
against #72.3m peviously. Sales were 10% higher with much of the growth
coming from Currys Superstores and PC World. Overall, underlying sales
growth was 3%. The ''brown'' goods market which includes items such as
computers, TVs, and camcorders, expanded by 2% last year, slightly
better than the growth seen in 1993/94.
There was strong demand in the TV, video and audio categories but this
was partially offset by continued weakness in camcorders and computer
consoles.
The ''white'' goods markets which takes in products such as fridges,
washing machines, and dishwashers, grew by 5%. Personal computers and
related products continued to perform strongly with sales of multimedia
machines taking an increasing share of the overall market. There was a
substantial increase in mobile telephone connections as a result of
higher penetration of the domestic market and the expansion of new
digital networks.
In a difficult property market, some progress was made in disposing of
surplus Currys stores. Just over 100 units were disposed of or converted
to other formats. At the year-end, 83 closed units were on the market,
of which over half were temporarily let. Costs incurred and anticipated
remain in line with the provision made in the 1993/94 financial year.
Currys reported sales of #863m. That was 11% higher than last year
with growth coming from the expanded superstore network. Increased
demand was seen across almost all product categories. More than 80% of
the Currys selling space is in superstore format. Later this year, a new
32,000sq ft Currys Superstore is scheduled to open in the West Midlands,
which will be the largest electrical store in the UK.
Dixons's sales dropped by 2% on an underlying basis affected by
further sharp declines in demand for camcorders and computer games.
Forty of the 354 stores were converted to a new format with greater
emphasis placed on carry-home consumer electronic products such as
cameras, mobile telephones, and personal computer software. The
conversion of the chain to the new format will be completed within two
years.
PC World saw its sales rise by 84% to #125m. Sales were boosted by the
introduction of new products in the autumn including multimedia personal
computers incorporating CD-ROMs. Among new superstores opened in the
year were sites at Aberdeen and Edinburgh. At least 10 additional store
openings are planned for the current year.
A new specialist communications store, The Link, traded on a trial
basis in eight locations in London and the Home Counties. More stores
are scheduled to open during the year which will sell mostly mobile
telephones.
Capital expenditure at #57.7m, up from #43.8m, was nearly double the
depreciation charge. The money was largely spent on new Currys and PC
World Superstores, the initial phase of Dixons's repositioning
programme, systems and the cost of fitting out the new headquarters in
Hemel Hempstead.
The group's financial position is strong with no gearing at the
year-end. Dixons's shares have enjoyed a strong run in recent weeks with
many in the City taking the view that the fundamentals of the business
have improved dramatically.
The the shares yesterday continued their upward march adding 13p to
281p. The company is set to increase selling space by 4% per annum for
the next two years which moves it towards the growth stock category.

Standards of care for elderly are deteriorating, say doctors
HALF the specialists in Scotland caring for the old and the mentally
ill think that services have become worse since the introduction of Care
in the Community, according to a survey of doctors' leaders published
yesterday.
Their findings were backed up by a senior Glasgow geriatrician who
claimed that some elderly patients in the city were waiting for up to
six months in hospital beds, receiving inappropriate care, because
residential or nursing home placements were not available.
Other professionals working in the community care sector said that
problems remained in terms of resources being matched to needs. And the
Scottish Association for Mental Health claimed that the Scottish Office
had been pressurised into agreeing to carry out a consultation exercise
about the NHS response for meeting the continuing health care needs of
Scottish people.
Doctors at the British Medical Association's annual conference in
Harrogate said that they were particularly concerned by the distress
caused to old people by the transfer of their long-term care to
means-tested local authority services.
A survey of geriatricians and psychiatrists by the BMA, published
yesterday at Harrogate, showed that only 31.6% thought there had been an
improvement, compared to 50% who thought there had been a deterioration.
A further 10% thought there had been no effect one way or the other.
Before the Care in the Community policy had been introduced, elderly
people who needed care received it from the NHS. Now their long-term
care is provided by social services -- either home-based or in a
residential or nursing home -- and that care is means-tested.
Dr Arnold Elliott, chairman of the BMA Community Care Committee, said:
''Old ladies are having to sell their houses to pay for long-term care.
In the case of Alzheimer's, they can go on for many years until nothing
is left for the family to inherit.''
Middlesbrough GP Dr Nigel Rowell said old people who fell ill were
praying for an early death, for fear of losing their savings. ''The
current arrangements are going to get worse. They are asset-stripping
the elderly and infirm,'' he said.
''Fear of long illness and the financial repercussions of long illness
are causing enormous grief among the elderly, even before they fall ill.
Savings built up over a lifetime they see disappearing to fund a private
nursing home place.
''No wonder that they hang on for as long as they possibly can at home
and, if they do fall ill, they all pray for a quick death.''
The BMA survey also revealed another phenomenon -- the blocking of
hospital beds by elderly people who were medically fit for discharge. It
claimed that 82% of geriatricians reported that the new assessment
arrangements under care in the community rules were delaying the
discharge of elderly people, leading to an average of 17 days' extra
stay.
Professor David Stott, the David Cargill Professor of Geriatric
Medicine at Glasgow University, backed up the doctors' finding of
bed-blocking. He said that in Glasgow the record of placement and
registration of elderly people in institutional care was very variable.
''Some elderly people will wait up to six months to find a place in
social work care from hospital. Some areas do it well, and some less
well. I am quite confused still as to the reasons for this. It is a
major concern that some elderly people are remaining in hospital in an
inappropriate care environment not suited to their needs and not getting
appropriate care for as long as six months,'' said Professor Stott.
Mr Bob Winter, deputy director for community care in Strathclyde
region's social work department, said his department monitored the
situation for bed-blocking but had found no evidence of it. However, his
department and the health board would be very happy to look at any
evidence if there was a problem.
He added that Strathclyde region was campaigning to have the rules
changed regarding charging procedures for residential and nursing home
care, particularly those covering the sale of elderly people's homes.
The Scottish co-ordinator of the Carers' National Association, Mr Alan
McGinley, also warned that in some areas, carers' incomes were being
assessed as well as the person requiring care by local authorities -- a
move which was against the rules.
The BMA conference called for a review of the Community Care Act and
expressed concern about the ambiguities surrounding the financing of
long-term care and ''ageist'' attitudes in the provision of funding of
health care for the elderly in the climate of a competitive NHS.
A spokesman for the Scottish Health Department said: ''There is no
evidence that bed-blocking is a problem in Scotland. We have
consistently said that no patient should be discharged into the
community without proper provision for their care being in place.''

IN the time honoured phrase, Dumbarton's Charlie Green yesterday
turned the race for the Famous Grouse Scottish Open Amateur Seniors Golf
Championship into a one-horse procession at Killermont. Yet afterwards
he expressed the opinion that the event should be extended from 36-holes
to three rounds, the duration of both the British and English versions.
Nevertheless Green, who will be 63 next month and was the winner of
the title in 1991, regained it by adding to the 68 he had in the hot
sunshine of Tuesday a score of 73 achieved in conditions of such
complete contrast that it was difficult to believe only 24 hours had
elapsed between the rounds.
Green's aggregate of 141, one over the par of the Glasgow club's
5968-yard course, gave him victory by six strokes over Bathgate's John
McLean, who returned as successfully as he was allowed to the scene of
his own triumph two years ago. Campbell Weir of Milngavie was third, a
stroke further behind.
In drably cold and wet weather, aggravated by a blustery south-west
wind, avoidance of mistakes was impossible. Green had the good sense, or
the good fortune, to make all but one of his in the first seven holes --
ironically, after he had holed his longest putt of the afternoon, from
20 feet for a 3 at the first.
Green then dropped five strokes over the next six holes, interspersing
a birdie 4 at the long fifth with a pitch to four feet. After that his
only mistake was to take three putts at the short eleventh, a stroke
whose loss he retrieved with a pitch dead at the thirteenth, and he
completed his round with five par figures as solid as were all the
others.
By Green's own stern analysis his driving lacked control in the wind
and his short game ''enabled me to score well without having hit the
ball particularly well.''
It is the longevity of Green's competitive career that is remarkable.
True, at 16 he was a later starter than most in these parts and he was
23 before he held a scratch handicap. But his first success of
consequence was in the 1959 Eden tournament, and on top of his many
championship and tournament wins and international team appearances
Green calculates he has won more than 100 36-hole events. Leading

OIL prices looked weak again yesterday amid fears that the overhang of
supply will not be met by increased demand for the rest of 1995.
World benchmark Brent Blend crude oil futures for August delivery were
quoted at $16.05 a barrel at the London close, after hitting a new 1995
low of $16.00 shortly before that.
The New York oil markets had been closed on Monday and Tuesday for the
US Independence Day holiday but were sharply lower from Friday's closing
prices when trading resumed on yesterday. Benchmark August West Texas
Intermediate crude futures were down 31 cents at $17.09 a barrel.
Some traders said that there were worries ahead of the latest
inventories report from the American Petroleum Institute (API) expected
later this week.
''But the bigger picture is what was going on at Opec,'' said Mike
Rothman, an oil analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, referring to the
recent meeting of oil ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
''Non-Opec supply is increasing and the world economy is slowing. And
there is a tendency to revise up forecasts for non-Opec oil supply,''
said Rothman.
''Basically, there's just too much oil around,'' said an analyst at
Refco Inc.
Oil prices have been in freefall since Brent peaked at $19.38 a barrel
on May. There was a brief respite in the middle of last week after
figures from the API showed that crude and gasoline stocks fell heavily
in the preceding week.
But the market quickly discounted the drop in stocks, which is typical
ahead of a big holiday weekend in the United States when more gasoline
is moved up to the pumps in anticipation of a surge in demand.
Analysts expect that this week's report will be ignored if it shows
another drop in stocks levels, but could trigger another sharp drop in
prices if it shows a disappointingly weak draw.
If August Brent prices push through $16 a barrel, analysts are
expecting it to quickly drop about another 50 cents. -- Reuter.

DUNDEE-based publisher of the Sunday Post, DC Thomson, has increased
its stake in newspaper distributor and retailer John Menzies.
Thomson, the largest shareholder in the Edinburgh-based company
outside the Menzies family, bought a further one million shares at a
price of 581p.
Its #5.8m purchase takes its stake in John Menzies to 8.8% and is
believed to be the first major increase in its stake since it purchased
it at the time the Edinburgh-based company was listed in 1962. Thomson
now owns 4.87 million shares.
However, although John Menzies distributes Thomson titles in some
parts of the country, the Edinburgh-based company's group financial
director, James Bennett, said: ''The investment considerations and the
trading considerations in both companies are completely separate.
''Their investment in us has been totally long-term and has played no
part whatsoever in any trading negotiations.''
Mr Bennett added that John Menzies was delighted Thomson had decided
to invest more in the company.
The shares involved were sold to Thomson by a trust which held them
for John Menzies' employee profit-sharing and share option schemes.
John Menzies, which distributes about 300,000 shares to its workforce
each year exclusive of share options, has authority to issue new shares
to replenish the trust's holdings.
On Monday, John Menzies announced an 11% increase in pre-tax profits
to #38.1m in the year to April.
Wholesaling and distribution raised trading profits by 9% to #26.2m.
Turnover on this side of the business advanced only 1.5%, having been
held back by the newspaper price war.
Shares in John Menzies were yesterday unchanged at 581p.

* TEXTILE group executive Johnny Mackenzie has been forced to sell all
his direct beneficial holding of 50,500 shares in tartan maker Seet to
meet the demands from Lloyds of London to cover losses. The stock has
been transferred to his brother James at 71p a share to raise almost
#36,000 gross to leave him with an indirect stake of 495,240 shares held
jointly with his father Jock.
The 69-year-old entrepreneur was one of the City's most colourful
characters in the 1960s and 1970s with interests in the now defunct
housebuilders Bardolin and London and Northern, and environmental groups
Tace and Goring Kerr.
Seet, formerly Scottish, English and European Textiles has had a
chequered career. Having been founded in 1906 in Stornoway by his
grandfather Kenneth Mackenzie, it went on the expansionist trail under
Jock's chairmanship but in recent years has had to cut back quite
severely through the disposal of various subsidiaries.

Nairobi, Wednesday
A FRENCH aid agency today described hellish conditions at Rwanda's
worst prison where nearly 1000 inmates have died from disease and
beatings and prisoners stand crammed shoulder-to-shoulder day and night.
Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) called on the
Rwandan Government to give inmates from Gitarama prison priority in
moving to new detention centres being built.
Dr Arnaud Veisse, medical co-ordinator at the MSF hospital near
Gitarama prison, said 992 prisoners had died in the 10 months since the
jail was reopened last August after Rwanda's genocide.
He said 7000 inmates were packed into the prison designed for 400,
forcing many to stand shoulder-to-shoulder even outside in the rain 24
hours a day with less than 5sq ft of space each.
Prisoners sleep leaning on each other, their feet rotting from
standing on wet and dirty ground, unable to escape disputes between
gangs of inmates, aid workers said. A trip to the toilet block takes 30
minutes because no-one will move.
Veisse said on average 100 prisoners died each month and many had to
have rotting feet or legs amputated. Prisoners suffered from chest
infections, dysentery, skin infections, malnutrition, and wounds from
beatings by other inmates were increasing.
''The only solution is to give them more space,'' said Veisse.
''Putting 7000 prisoners in a place designed for 400 and despair
explains such behaviour.''
* News that Hutus had killed almost 40 people outside Burundian
capital Bujumbura caused an upsurge of violence in the city. Witnesses
said Tutsi militiamen stoned a man to death and grenades exploded near
the US and Zairean embassies, wounding several people.--Reuter.

RESTORING the feel-good factor among Britain's home owners has and
continues to be a major aim of the right-wing opposition to John Major.
It remains to be seen whether John Major's victory in the Tory
leadership election will lead to any new housing initiatives.
It is not surprising people are feeling less than comfortable given
that for many -- albeit the majority in southern England -- their prime
asset is worth considerably less than they paid for it, so called
negative equity. Many of these people live in key marginal seats and so
their political clout is considerable.
The creation of a home-owning democracy was a major plank of Mrs
Thatcher's programme. It is no use now Mr Major criticising the way
people paid over the odds for properties in the late 1980s. Government
action at the time, principally the decision to make Miras payable per
property rather than per individual, helped overheat the property
market.
One of the many anomalies in the housing market is that rents have
shown little reaction to the recession. If anything they have been
pushed up in certain residential areas. Many people who have managed to
sell their property have decided to rent for a while to see how the
market settles down before taking on another major financial commitment.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that after the usual industry hype at the
start of the year there was a recovery in the market but this has since
petered out, with few willing or able to put their houses on the market.
The latest Nationwide monthly index shows transactions running at 10%
below the same period last year. Recent figures from the Halifax,
Britain's biggest mortgage lender, have confirmed that in terms of
prices and volumes the housing market is flat to falling. House prices
are a major factor in consumer confidence and hence the Government's
fortunes in the opinion polls.
There is no easy path to reviving the housing market. Building
societies are split over the best course of action. Growth in personal
disposable income for those in work, a key driver of the market, remains
subdued. While there are some people calling for restoration of Mortgage
Interest Tax Relief (Miras), which has been cut from 25% to 15% over the
past 15 months, this would probably be insufficient to generate much of
the elusive feel-good factor. With interest and inflation rates
remaining low, a restoration of tax relief at the basic rate and a rise
in the #30,000 ceiling would have a minimal effect on the cost of home
ownership.
According to Peter Spencer, Professor of Financial Economics at
Birkbeck College, London, for such a policy reversal to be effective it
would have to be combined with a major macroeconomic expansion and an
unacceptable rise in the general rate of inflation. The battle to keep
inflation low is one of the few tangible economic benefits of this Tory
Government so it is difficult to see it willingly losing credibility in
the inflation arena.
So what are the other options? One is to introduce tax breaks for home
owners with negative equity who save to pay off their unsecured debt.
This is thought to be under serious consideration although it is
unlikely to provide a quick solution.
It would provide those with negative equity with a steady stream of
additional income, which would eventually feed through into savings to
pay off negative equity. Time, however, is not a luxury the Government
has given that the General Election will be within two years.
Another option is to abolish stamp duty on property transactions,
either temporarily or permanently.
Thirdly, the Government could increase spending on social housing in
an attempt to mop up the overhang of poorer quality dwellings.
A fourth option is to raise the rate at which Miras is deducted (15%
from April this year) or the ceiling for relief (#30,000 since 1983).
This last option could be coupled with restricting the benefits to
first-time buyers.
More imaginatively, the Government could allow mortgage holders to
convert future Miras benefit to an immediate capital sum, thereby
providing the capital necessary to pay off negative equity.
There are some who fear that any Government action to stimulate the
housing market could create another artificial boom followed by a slump.
The City is starting to worry about the giveaways that may start to flow
as we approach the next General Election. It perceives the ''best'' of
these options to be a policy of allowing home owners to capitalise
future Miras. This would have no long-term cost and would minimise
market distortions.
First-time buyers as ever remain the key. If they can be persuaded
that houses are affordable and desirable then the market will recover
eventually, allowing those with negative equity to escape their plight.

YOU may have thought the most relieved folk after John Major's victory
were his campaign team, led by the straightest bat in the business, our
own Ian Lang. I was rather anxious about the result myself; if John
Redwood had won I would have walked away from the Conservative Party
which I have represented for 25 years, a decision I was persuaded to
keep to myself while the contest was in progress.
But that is a minor matter. No, the tension was most eased when the
result became known in the Republic of Ireland, from where I write. They
are aware of the contribution John Major has made to the peace process
in the North and they literally prayed for him to stay.
Minutes after the announcement was made the former Irish Taoiseach
(PM), Albert Reynolds, declared: ''I know of no British Prime Minister
who has given so much of his personal time to the Irish question and I
welcome his victory.''
His successor, John Bruton, said he was ''glad the uncertainty is at
an end and that we can now get on with the work. We know John Major and
have a high regard for him.''
Even the Opposition leader, Bertie Ahern, was singing a similar song.
''I welcome the resolution of the Tory leadership contest. It is
imperative that we re-establish the momentum in the peace process.''
Mr Major would also enjoy reading his Irish press cuttings. ''For
Ireland it was a good result,'' trumpeted a leader in the Irish
Independent. ''Even when we have to argue with him about certain courses
of action he takes it is because we want him, as the man who has made
the greatest effort since Edward Heath to solve the Irish problem. If
anyone can move the peace process forward it is John Major.''
The Cork Examiner decided: ''At a critical time in the peace process
this result will remove the unsettling imponderable that Mr Major is not
his own man and has had to ponder to the Unionists inside and outside
his party.''
It must be an awfully long time since a British Prime Minister has
received these kind of rave reviews in the Republic. What make them all
the more remarkable is that they come in the week in which Private Lee
Clegg was released.
Let me make it clear that I am delighted the man from the Parachute
Regiment has regained his freedom. He is a victim of the troubles in
Northern Ireland, it is doubtful if he should ever have been charged
with murder, and, for the reasons which have been given, Sir Patrick
Mayhew was right to take the action he did.
Having said that I can also understand the anger this has generated in
Nationalist circles. As a contribution to the peace process it was never
going to be anything other than a petrol-soaked rag.
Was it not possible to find a Republican prisoner whose case might
have been as sympathetically treated as that of Private Clegg? I read
the other day of a Belfast man who has served 10 years for attempted
murder; the offence was committed when he was just 17 years old.
Is it fair that Clegg was immediately sent to Britain to serve his
time when Irish prisoners are denied access to Ulster jails? How can
that be justified? You know, if the peace process is really to advance
then there will have to be concessions on all sides. We could start by
binning the emotive words -- bombers, maimers, murderers -- and
recognise that the only people with whom the British Government can deal
are those, from both religious wings, to whom these descriptions could
be applied.
Dreadful, desperate deeds were done in Ulster by the IRA and the
Protestant paramilitaries; the reality is that they will have to put
that behind them and live together.
I find the present emphasis on the decommissioning of arms to be a
cul-de-sac on moving ahead. Do we really envisage a situation where the
Provos come marching down the Falls Road, Armalites under their arms,
and promptly hand them over, no doubt receiving an appropriate receipt,
at the nearest RUC station? That is cloud cuckoo land . . . it would
also be totally meaningless.
First, we would have no way of determining whether these were all the
weapons in the community. ''Are you sure you don't have any arms under
your bed? Mr O'Donnell. ''And did you pack this case yourself?''
Secondly, surely no-one doubts that if Mr Gerry Adams went off to the
United States and made an appeal for funds, his arsenal could be
replenished in a month. The important point is not that there are arms
in Ulster -- when was that not true? -- but that they are currently not
firing, and killing, people.
There should be no concessions, to Adams or anyone else, on the
question of sovereignty. As long as the majority of the population in
Ulster wish to remain British they must be allowed to do so. It is for
the Irish Republic to sell its own charms; the UK Government cannot be
persuaders.
But that does not mean that we do not need to convince the Catholic
minority in Ulster that they will receive equal treatment under the law.
They do not perceive that to be the case at present and, quite honestly,
it is hard to blame them.
I happen to believe that peace in Ulster is a far more important issue
than whether a single European currency ever emerges. Maybe it is not a
huge vote-winner either way in a General Election, though there are an
awful lot of Irish people able to vote in such an event. Yesterday, on
RTE radio, I heard some of them say why they would be voting Tory --
because they were doing very well, thank you, under this Government.
In any case, as the comments above have illustrated, this is John
Major's big picture, the reason he may find an honoured place in
history. I hope he wins as decisively as he did on Tuesday . . . for he
deserves to.

A BRITISH holidaymaker's desperate bid to rescue his wife when she
tumbled into a crocodile-infested river in Kenya ended in a triple
tragedy, with the couple and a teenager drowning.
Mother-of-four Mrs Linda Stewart, 46, slipped on the bank and plunged
into the fast-flowing Galana River as she tried to get a better look at
a spectacular waterfall in Tsavo National park.
Her husband John, 50, watched in horror -- then dived after her in a
valiant rescue bid.
A third Briton, 18-year-old Christopher Williams, jumped after him to
help.
Tonight officials assumed all three had drowned, although a huge boat
and air search by police and wildlife rangers failed to find their
bodies after Saturday's tragedy.
Mr and Mrs Stewart, from Morpeth, Northumberland, had been married for
29 years. They had made the four-hour drive to the park from their
holiday resort near Mombassa.
They had flown to Africa for their two-week holiday three days
earlier.
British authorities in Kenya said today the heroism of the two men
probably cost them their lives.
The tragic excursion is thought to have been organised by local tour
operators known as beachboys.
A British High Commission spokesman in the capital Nairobi said: ''We
now think the three of them are dead, but we cannot say for definite
what has happened to them until they are found.''
A Foriegn Office spokesman said Mr Williams lived near the holiday
resort with his ex-patriate parents.

XENOPHOBIA means never having to say you're sorry, mostly because your
average jabbering foreign Johnny doesn't understand plain English
anyhow. Xenophobia means the world never changes and the sun never sets
on a pink-mottled map, a world of coons, spics, wops, frogs, wogs,
dagoes, yids, and normal people, people like us, promenading in the
mid-day sun with the mad dogs, shielded by the pound sterling, the Royal
Navy, and a passport in which Her Britannic Majesty yet commands all she
cares to survey.
Xenophobia is the land of warm beer, cricket on the green, and young
women dying trussed and bound by officers of the law, before whom all
are equal. In Xenophobia everyone is entitled to their opinion, not
least to the view that Englishmen with black skins are less committed to
their country's cause than whites. In Xenophobia we just know -- it's
something in the blood -- that the idea of a multi-national nation is a
nonsense.
Some coincidences are fruitful. Just as the Tory party was pretending
to exorcise its dread of Europe, an individual named Robert Henderson
was stating in Wisden Cricket Monthly -- bedside reading, one may guess,
for the cricket-loving leadership candidates -- that Asians and
''negroes'', irrespective of their nationality, do not ''feel the same
pride and identification with England as a white man''.
Henderson added that blacks were thus flawed ''through no fault of
their own'', a remark whose meaning seemed perfectly clear. It doesn't
matter where you were born, it doesn't matter how you were educated, it
doesn't matter how many runs you score or medals you win, it doesn't
matter what you think or feel: you cannot be both British and black.
Lord Tebbit, busy this week reaffirming his belief that Britain is in
danger of surrendering the fundamental freedom to call a pound a pound,
started this game some time ago. He it was who devised the ''cricket
test'', arguing that anyone who chose to support the land of their
fathers against England could not be deemed an assimilated Briton.
Evidently he forgot the Scots, the Welsh, and the Irish, perhaps because
many of them are white and whites all look the same.
But you wonder what really separates the likes of Henderson, deserted
now even by the kaffir-killers, from the Europhobic Conservatives who
have ceased to pretend their hatred of Europe has anything to do with
economic arguments. When the business community and the Tories fall out,
as they have done over the single currency, look to visceral prejudices,
not reason. Euro-sceptics (why ''sceptics''? -- they are in no doubt)
despise foreigners.
So what does that make me, or most of you? Conscripted to the cause of
Britland, we have less claim to a stake in the English nation than a
black youth raised in Brixton or an Asian girl brought up in Birmingham.
We are foreign according to every definition advanced by Henderson,
Tebbit, or Bill Cash's New Model Army yet they maintain their lease on
our loyalties simply to preserve a vision of Albion. So hands up who
mourned when England crashed out of the Rugby World Cup; who failed the
test? Whatever its implications for the tenancy of the Scottish Office,
the Tory leadership election was almost entirely an English affair. That
aspect has been little discussed, mostly because the English media set
the agenda and were more concerned, when they bothered at all, with
arguing over the Conservatives' failure to consult the voters.
But look at those 329 Tory MPs (by the way, how is it that the ''most
sophisticated electorate in the world'' managed to spoil all those
ballot papers?). So few among them are Scots it is absurd even to
pretend that Scotland had any real part to play in this great affair of
the British state. This was Little England (shrinking by the day) going
about its business.
That business, of course, was a combat over the nature of their
relationship with foreigners. How much racism -- let's call a Tory MP a
shovel -- was proper for the patriotic party? How much prejudice should
be translated into policy? How to deal with 270 million souls who don't
even know what cricket is? There is an argument over monetary union, of
course, one that Blair's Labour is keen to avoid. Do we accept that
monetarism should be, as one description has it, ''hard-wired'' within
the political structure of Europe by an independent central bank, with
all that implies for the equation between deflation and unemployment, or
do we not? It ought to be meat and drink to Tories, but they don't want
to know.
Instead, the chosen topic is the ''repatriation of sovereignty'',
meaning an effort to keep foreigners out of their affairs. As this
column has argued before, many Scots would also like their sovereignty
back, but the people least likely to concede that claim are the patriots
on the Tory right.
FOR them, and for administrative purposes, we too are English. Those
of us who happen to be white are exempted from the tests of blood and
nationhood. Just as black performers in apartheid South Africa became
''honorary'' whites, we are honorary English men and women.
Persuaded by the slimy prejudices of Settler Watch and the like to
watch what we say, most of us have been reluctant to confront the fact.
But England now looks like a deeply damaged society, mired in its own
myths and rendered vulnerable, as a result, to racism. Thus the very
people who inveigh against Scotland's civic nationalism are often ethnic
nationalists of the worst sort.
Or put it this way: the only difference between mad dogs and Little
Englanders is that mad dogs don't become MPs.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission today moved to brush aside a British veto by
calling employers and workers to talks on a new EU sex discrimination
law.
The planned new rules would reverse the burden of proof in such cases.
''It has been shown in practice that it is difficult and sometimes
impossible for complainants to prove that differences in pay or
treatment amount to discrimination,'' said EU Social Affairs Commisioner
Padraig Flynn.
He said there was a need to ease ''the difficulties of evidence
gathering and proof which can often frustrate reasonable claims''.
If the Commission has its way, an unhappy worker would simply have to
show there is a case of discrimination to answer, leaving the employer
to prove the accusation false.
The new law is one of a series of pieces of ''equality'' legislation
which have been blocked, mainly by Britain.
To get round British objections, the EU executive is using a provision
of the Social Protocol of the Maastricht Treaty, which allows the EU to
adopt social laws by qualified majority voting rather than only if all
countries agree.
The Commission said Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Spain,
and Sweden already had laws shifting the burden of proof in sex
discrimination cases.
Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the
United Kingdom, and Portugal have rules or case law on the burden of
proof only in specific areas of pay, dismissal, or pregnancy.--Reuter..

PROFESSOR Stephen Hawking, who wrote about the mysteries of the
universe in his bestselling book A Brief History of Time, is to marry
his nurse, according to reports.
The 53-year-old Cambridge University scientist, who is
wheelchair-bound because of the crippling motor neurone disease, and Mrs
Elaine Mason will marry in September, the Daily Telegraph says.
Professor Hawking divorced his former wife, medieval linguist Dr Jane
Hawking, four years ago after 26 years of marriage. They have three
grown-up children. She originally hired the nurse.
Mrs Mason was married to scientist David Mason, who designed Professor
Hawking's voice synthesiser, his only means of communication.

FOUR tourists, two Britons and two Americans, were kidnapped this week
while visiting the Indian province of Kashmir, the Foreign Office said.
''They were walking in the Kashmir hills and a military group overran
them and took four of them off,'' said a spokesman.
The four disappeared in a popular holiday area near Srinagar. The
Foreign Office had no more information on those kidnapped but relatives
said one of the Britons was Paul Wells, a 23-year-old photography
student who was on a six-week trekking holiday in India. Last November,
two policemen and a militant were killed in shoot-outs when police
launched raids to free four Western tourists, who included three
Britons.

<TEXT>
THE impresario Cameron Mackintosh has told The Herald that he may
provide financial backing for a buy-out of Knoydart Estate.
The historic estate of 16,500 acres, considered one of Britain's last
great wildernesses, is expected to go on the market for a reported #1.6m
next month.
Knoydart community association, representing the estate's 50
residents, met last night to discuss future plans. They have called for
a community buy-out backed by a consortium of environmental bodies, and
have vowed to fight any takeover moves from developers or large firms.
The estate has been dogged by controversy and financial problems since
Scottish jute company Titaghur bought the land for #1.7m two years ago.
Mr Mackintosh, the producer of some of the biggest British stage
musicals, including Cats, Miss Saigon, and the revival of Oliver, has
ruled out a complete buy-out. But he said he may back a deal involving a
public conservation body.
Mr Mackintosh told The Herald: ''My interest is as a neighbour rather
than a purchaser. I am sympathetic and concerned that Knoydart is
preserved as the beautiful and special place it is.
''I would be prepared to discuss with a responsible body what I could
do to help. Financial help is possible but I don't know how much that
could be at this stage -- it would only be as one of several
contributors.''
Mr Mackintosh, 48, owns the neighbouring 12,000-acre North Morar
estate, which he bought from the Lovat Fraser family last year.
He spent much of his childhood in the west Highlands in his aunt and
uncle's croft, which he later inherited. The sale went down well with
locals, who regarded Mr Mackintosh as a sympathetic landlord. He has
already donated #100,000 towards the Mallaig swimming pool, which he
also opened, and gave a #15,000 minibus to the village.

VICTIMS of the December floods in Paisley welcomed the Queen into
their homes yesterday to witness the damage first hand and inspect
renovation work.
On a dank afternoon she clutched a small black umbrella as she met
residents of Candren Road, Ferguslie Park -- one of the worst affected
areas.
She was then shown the home of Mrs Mary McDaid, 63, daughter Rose, 26,
and grand-daughter Shannon, 2, who are still unable to return to the
house because of repair work.
Mrs McDaid said: ''We showed her some pictures of the house at the
time and she was shocked when she saw what it was like.''
The Duke of Edinburgh visited the home of fellow flood victim Mr Ann
McIlwraith before the royal couple went on to open officially the new
#4.6m Tannahill community centre in Ferguslie Park.
Several families in Paisley are still living in temporary
accommodation while flood repairs are carried out, the final bill for
which is expected to top #2m.
Earlier, the royal couple completed a busy tour of Ayr, where Her
Majesty officially opened a new day surgery unit at Ayr Hospital.
The Bruce Day Surgery Suite, which cost #3.7m, will handle up to
15,000 operations a year and is Scotland's first purpose built day
facility.
The Queen also visited Burns Cottage and the Tam O' Shanter Experience
at Alloway, where she unveiled a plaque to mark the opening of the new
Burns National Heritage Park.

THE Sultan of Brunei will be awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree
at the University of Aberdeen today.
The degree is being conferred at a special ceremony in the Mitchell
Hall, Marischal College, in recognition of his promotion of education in
Brunei.
The Sultan flew into Aberdeen last night in the biggest aircraft ever
to land at its airport.
He was greeted by the Lord Lieutentant of Aberdeen, Lord Provost James
Wyness and the Lady Provost, principal of Aberdeen University Professor
Maxwell Irvine, chief executive of Aberdeen City Council Ann Mearns, and
Grampian Chief Constable Dr Ian Oliver.
He was then driven to the Marcliffe at Pitfodels Hotel where elaborate
arrangements had been made to cater for the man who is reputed to be
worth #25,000m.
Thirty rooms have been taken over by the Sultan, including the whole
of the hotel's 'old house', with his brother, HRH Prince Jefri, given a
floor of his own.
Twenty-four hours earlier, the Sultan's personal chefs flew in to
prepare for his arrival. Other preparations included setting up
satellite links to the Sultan's palace.
Aberdeen University operates a successful exchange system with its
counterpart in Brunei.
The Sultan himself has taken particular interest in encouraging
research in geology and petroleum engineering because of their
importance to the oil industry. He has encouraged many of the links
between Brunei and Aberdeen.
The Sultan is to meet students from his country later today.

AFTER many disappointments in the transfer market, Celtic FC have
signed a whole new team. According to artist Jonathan Cassells, that is.
Mr Cassells is one of many printmakers exhibiting in the Sporting
Prints show currently at the Glasgow Print Studio in King Street.
(Prices to suit all pockets. Just ask for the boss, that nice man John
McKechnie who even accepts Provvie cheques.)
The Cassells contribution to the sporting images consists of team
portraits of the Old Firm, with unusual interesting heads superimposed
on the green and white jerseys. Billy Connolly is now team captain. Myra
Hindley and Mother Teresa make up the full-back partnership.
His Holiness JPII appears to be a central defender, although how he
hopes to head the ball clear while wearing that hat is a mystery. The
pool includes two Madonnas, one a rock singer and one with child.
Rabbie Burns would appear to be a skilful midfielder while Indian
chief Geronimo is leading the charge up front along with Rupert Murdoch,
Gerry Adams, Princess Di, and Dumber of the film of that name.
Donald Duck is on the wing. If Celtic can pay his bill, that is.
Mr Cassells's version of the Rangers line-up is: Sean Connery
(captain), Charles Manson, Esther Rantzen, HM the Queen, Prince Charles
(sub), Mickey Mouse, the singer formerly known as Prince, Sir Walter
Scott, John Wayne, Barbie, Dumb (sub), Ian Paisley, and Sergeant Bilko.
Piqued at the post
IRISH TV racing commentators are a rare and excitable breed. Ted
Walshe, doing the business at the Curragh for RTE at the Irish Derby
last weekend, shouted the cuddies home with the words: ''. . . and
Winged Love comes to beat Definite Article by a short bloody head!'' No

BELATED intelligence from South Africa brought to us by a returning

Its slogan: ''Come to Africa. See the animals. Eat them.'' Veggies need
not apply.
We wonder if the wife of a certain rugby fan is speaking to him yet.
The chap, a doctor not unknown in rugby circles, casually mentioned he
might look in at a few World Cup games. Certainly dear, she said. She
thought it was being held at Murrayfield. He didn't tell her it was
South Africa until the bags were packed.

ANOTHER small ad in a local paper, this time under the heading
''Clocks and watches for sale''. It reads: ''Cuckoo clock. Very annoying
cuckoo clock for sale. Someone hurry and buy it, before the cuckoo gets
it.''
Le raffle
AS Bastille Day approaches, our Auld Alliance competition nears its
end. (Entries in by Monday if you wish to be included in le raffle of
contributions printed.)
We have further examples of how Scotland and France are united by two
separate languages, as George Bernard Shaw never said. Margaret Glenday
writes from Monifieth with the story of a Scots lady exercising her
French on holiday. Having thoroughly enjoyed a gateau recommended by
monsieur le patissier she decides to order another one ''aussi grand que
ma derriere''.
The scene for the tale from Robert McIntyre of Greenock is the Gare St
Lazaire where he is sitting in a train, en famille, complete with
mother-in-law. It is a hot and humid day and just before the train
departs a chic and sophisticated French lady boards the train and sits
beside the mother-in-law.
The French lady proceeds to fan herself with her glove, at which point
mother-in-law leans forward, pats her on the knee and asks in concerned
tones: ''Are ye a' puffed oot, hen?''
Finally, the story from Alistair Donald of Langholm about a Glasgow
businessman, extremely wealthy but a bit of a rough diamond. Informality
was his keynote which did not go down too well with some of the staff at
his bank, a Glasgow branch of one of the Scottish clearing houses.
One day the teller was extremely snooty about the crumpled state of
the banknotes which had been produced from various pockets. Dirty money
was as good as clean money, our man retorted and instructed the teller
to close his account forthwith, if not sooner.
He was telling his story some weeks later to his pals in the pub and
informed them: ''Ah jist walked across the street and went in tae yon
Credit Lyonnaise (or Lee-oan-ezz as he pronounced it) and ah huv hud nae
bother since.
''And ye know whit? Ah took the burd tae Paris last weekend and
there's hunners o' thae Credit Lee-oan-ezzes and I didnae see wan
Clydesdale bank.''
Unseasonal
greetings
WITH the Glasgow Fair almost upon us, it is only natural that thoughts
should turn to Christmas. Unseasonal greetings to the Singing Kettle
children's show for issuing the booking form for their festive
performances and to the Inn on the Green restaurant urging customers to
book now for Christmas.

United Nations, Wednesday
IRAQ has admitted for the first time the offensive nature of its
biological weapons programme.
Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Commission in charge of scrapping Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction, told the Security Council after his recent
visit to Baghdad: ''Iraq admitted for the first time the offensive
nature of its biological weapons programme.''
He added that until now Baghdad had insisted that its military
biological programme was limited to defensive research and that no
weapons agents had ever been produced.
Iraq said large quantities of biological warfare agents known as
clostridium bolutlinum and bacillus anthracis were produced at the
al-Hakam site in 1989 and 1990. Baghdad maintained, however, that the
agents were destroyed in 1990.
Ekeus said Iraq promised ''full, final, and complete disclosure'' of
all aspects of the biological programme by the end of the month.
The biological weapons programme is the last big gap in verifying
Iraq's proscribed weapons before the Security Council can seriously
consider lifting sanctions.--Reuter.

<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977535207</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A BUS company's safety procedures were not sufficient when one of its
drivers was killed, a sheriff ruled yesterday.
Mr Thomas Butcher, 52, died when a bus reversed over his head in the
Kilmarnock bus station where he worked as a driver.
His employer, Western Scottish Buses Ltd, was found guilty of two
health and safety offences after a five-day trial at Kilmarnock Sheriff
Court.
It had denied blame during the proceedings. The verdict, according to
health and safety experts, could have far-reaching implications for bus
depots throughout Scotland.
Mr Cameron Adam, an inspector with the Health and Safety Executive,
said: ''The results of this case may well cause us to look at further
safety measures in all stations although there are no firm proposals at
the moment.''
Western Scottish, which employs 850 people and operates 450 buses, is
owned by Stagecoach but was an independent company at the time of the
offences.
The company was convicted of failing to ensure the safety of its
employees, in particular Mr Thomas Butcher, of Stewarton, by not having
a safe system for reversing vehicles.
It was also convicted of failing to take a suitable and safe
assessment of the role of health and safety for its employees, in
particular when exposed to the risk of being struck by a reversing
vehicle.
Both offences took place between June 30 and November 24 last year. Mr
Butcher was killed in July.
Sheriff Terence Russell said drivers had no real view when reversing
and employees' lives were put in danger because the company allowed them
to walk across the concourse where buses continually entered and left
the station.
He said he was not convinced -- as defence advocate Mr Hugh Gibb had
claimed -- that it was impossible to isolate reversing buses from
employees.
He deferred sentence for four weeks.

DIFFERENCES between dissident Scottish Pride shareholders and the
company's directors will not be resolved by ''throwing bloody knives at
one another,'' a newly appointed director warned yesterday.
Lanarkshire dairy farmer Alex Brown, who was appointed to the board
last week, admitted that there had been a breakdown in communication but
it was now time to get round the table and try to repair the damage that
had been done, he said.
''At the end of the day, as milk producers, your future depends
entirely on the success of Scottish Pride.''
The bitter division which has developed between some of the
farmer/shareholders in Scottish Pride and the milk committee of the
National Farmers Union of Scotland was demonstrated yesterday at the NFU
council meeting at Ingliston.
Council members who were also founder members of the shareholders'
association questioned the NFU's involvement in what they saw as a
disagreement between shareholders and the Scottish Pride board.
John Ross, president, said that he had been saddened at the fact that
various sectors of the milk committee had been pitted against each other
-- and neighbour against neighbour.
The controversy centres on five critical resolutions submitted by the
shareholders' association for discussion at the Scottish Pride annual
general meeting later this month.
The NFU milk committee has advised shareholders to vote against the
motions.
That advice, suggested Robin Christie, could represent a breach of the
Financial Services Act. The shareholders' association views were similar
to the NFU's, he claimed. ''We want to see a successful Scottish Pride
and get rid of the innuendo which has surrounded share dealings. That is
why the association was set up.''
Tom Reid, vice-convener of the milk committee, admitted that he had
been partly responsible for setting up the shareholders' group. Later he
stepped down from his role as interim chairman after being advised by
the NFU that it could constitute a conflict of interests with his
position as vice-convener.
''I feel a right miserable son-of-a-gun here today,'' he said. The
shareholders' association had been founded not to attack Scottish Pride
but to strengthen it.
''People were beginning to ask questions and the association was set
up to put the record straight. We were in negotiation. It should have
been left alone to get on with the job. We needed another week and there
would have been a joint statement from the two parties and everything
would have been okay.
''I would do the same again because I feel it was a forum where
Scottish Pride could come and get the feeling of the shareholders.''
Mr Ross said the union's milk committee had always tried to deal in
facts. There had been a problem with regard to one member trying to buy
shares in Scottish Pride. There had also been a communication problem.
The milk committee firmly believed that if the critical resolutions
from the shareholders' association were voted on and approved the
effects on the Scottish milk industry would far outweigh the original
problem. The committee had to represent views from all areas and had
adopted a statesmanlike approach, he said.
The council agreed to endorse the committee's views that the critical
resolutions should not be supported.
The majority of shareholders in the company -- formerly the
manufacturing arm of the old Milk Marketing Board -- are dairy farmers
who received shares at the time of deregulation when Scottish Pride
became a plc.
The council also agreed that the NFUS should seek to improve its own
communications with its membership, the public and the media by setting
up a public affairs division. Its role will be to get the farmers'
message over on issues such as animal welfare, environmental concerns
and food policy.

BOYS' CHAMPIONSHIP
STEVEN Young made a rocky start to the defence of his Scottish Boys'
Strokeplay championship at Arbroath yesterday.
He went out of bounds at the second and ran up a double bogey, then
followed up with another double bogey at the next, when he hit trouble
in the bunkers. However, after going seven over with two to play, Young
produced a stunning eagle, birdie finish to card a four-over-par 74.
Leading the way on 71 were Stewart Whiteford, Ian Birrell, and Steven

Portland, Wednesday
A PROSECUTOR today accused two former followers of free-love guru
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh of taking part in ''killing conferences'' held to
plot the murder of the US Attorney for Oregon.
Prosecutor Tim Reardon outlined the US government's case against
Britons Sally-Anne Croft and Susan Hagan in opening arguments at their
trial in Oregon.
The two women have pleaded not guilty to charges of plotting in 1985
to kill Charles Turner, then Oregon's chief federal prosecutor, who was
heading an investigation of the Rajneesh commune.
Croft, 45, and Hagan, 48, were top financial advisers to Rajneesh, the
so-called ''rich man's guru'', who attracted 4000 followers to his
commune on a former ranch in eastern Oregon in the early 1980s.
Referring to them by their commune names of Ma Prem Savita and Ma
Anand Su, Reardon said they participated in a plot that included
organising ''hit teams'' and gun-buying expeditions to other states.
They and Hagan were indicted in 1990 along with several other Rajneesh
cult leaders and were extradited from Britain this year after a
five-year legal battle.
The plot was never carried out and Turner is scheduled to testify at
the trial. In court documents, prosecutors allege that Croft and Hagan
provided funds for the weapons used in the plot as well as helping to
plan the killing.
The two women appeared relaxed and smiling as they entered the
courtroom. The trial is expected to last several weeks.
Leslie Weatherhead, Croft's lawyer, said the government's case would
be built on the testimony of five former commune members who he said
were known liars.
He said Croft was the product of a British working-class background
who became ''smitten'' with Rajneesh when she met him in the mid-1970s
on a trip to Poona, India.
Croft left the cult heartbroken in late 1985 after Rajneesh told her
he did not care for his followers but was only concerned for his
material possessions including his 93 Rolls-Royce cars and his many
Rolex watches, said Weatherhead.
The commune disbanded in 1985 after Rajneesh admitted arranging sham
marriages for his followers so they could immigrate to the US. He was
deported and moved back to Poona, where he died in 1990.--Reuter.

IT WAS always destined to be the Rapid Reaction Force which would be
neither rapid nor able to react in time to be effective. The command
structure of the Franco-British deployment to Bosnia dictates that it
must be controlled by the United Nations. It is fly-by-wire from New
York and fly-by-night by concept. The decision-making process is 5000
miles and a universe away from reality. Up to 10,000 troops are about to
be committed to a mission which has patently failed before it starts.
The French, British, and the UN are marching to the sound of different
drums.
The only sensible course now is the withdrawal of peacekeepers before
winter traps isolated and under-gunned detachments in untenable
positions from which they could not be extricated before next spring. UN
dignity and credibility is in tatters. Meanwhile, its Blue Helmets are
dying on mountain roads without adequate means of self-defence or
recourse to meaningful retaliation. The French have taken the heaviest
casualties in pursuit of humanitarian relief in former Yugoslavia. They
have sustained 39 dead and almost 160 wounded over the past two years to
no lasting effect. The Serbian shelling of declared ''safe'' areas last
month made a nonsense of UN claims that an international military
presence prevented an escalation of the ethnic war which has already
cost 200,000 lives. The UN backed away from ordering the defence of
heavy-weapons depots. It allowed almost 400 of its personnel to be taken
hostage to prevent Nato air strikes against Serb gun positions. Its
chief negotiator vetoed a more robust response to Serb aggression.
The despatch of heavily-armed brigades of British and French soldiers
can have only one purpose. They are there to safeguard the withdrawal of
their comrades. Even if the UN expanded its mandate to allow the use of
military force to guarantee unrestricted passage on the routes to
besieged enclaves, 10,000 men would be too few to be effective and too
many to be safe from Serb retaliation. On the eve of its 50th
anniversary, the UN is facing its greatest crisis of confidence. Bosnia
is a failure in both diplomatic and military terms. It may be time for
the General Assembly to cut its losses before the nations contributing
men and money take away that level of choice permanently.

ANYONE reading your coverage of the BMA annual conference could be
forgiven for not realising that the BMA is a doctors' trade union, not a
professional body such as the various accountants' institutes (July 4).
However, your attitude is not the same to all trade unions: those in
dispute over pay are rightly called ''health service unions'' on the
same page. I suggest that we use the same sauce for geese and ganders.
There would be more excuse for taking the BMA seriously if it were not
for its chairman, Sandy Macara, the Jimmy Knapp of the medical world.
With all the charm and allure of a wet winter Sunday in Stornoway, Dr
Macara tries to make our hair stand on end with his totally
unsubstantiated tales of the ''best and brightest'' leaving medicine.
I look forward to a procession of doctors standing up in Harrogate to
confess: ''I have stayed in medicine. Yes, I am one of the worst and
stupidest.''
Perhaps Dr Macara's girning would be more effective if the example
paraded on the first day of a ''best and brightest'' leaver were not
unemployed: is there really no-one willing to take on this brilliant
exile from the NHS?
There is a serious issue lurking here but don't expect the BMA to
address it: are the methods used for selecting potential doctors, which
rely so much on school exams whose predictive value is known to be low,
and for training them, in a world far removed from that which they will
experience after qualification, satisfactory for today's demands?

THE Government last night rejected a call for tighter rules on school
inspections.
Liberal Democrat peer the Earl of Mar and Kellie had wanted
inspections to be made on a routine basis and in response to any
reasonable complaint by a child or his parent.
The background to the debate in the House of Lords on the Children
(Scotland) Bill was the recent allegations of bullying at Fettes College
in Edinburgh, whose old boys include Labour leader Mr Tony Blair.
However, Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie said a
number of allegations against the school ''seem to have been made in
extremely unfair circumstances''.
He believed the Government's measures were enough, whereby inspectors
could be asked to investigate and report at any time, and there was a
mechanism for taking up complaints against individual schools. This
could be triggered by pupils or their parents.
The Bill, currently at its report stage in the Lords, puts forward a
number of recommendations, most of which stem from the Orkney and Fife
child care inquiries.

TWO out of three workers in Scotland are suffering from occupational
stress. Alarming and frightening it may be, but this is the finding of a
thorough and extensive survey carried out by my union -- Manufacturing,
Science &amp; Finance -- across a range of industries.
The most recent MSF workplace survey (carried out across three months)
shows that 64% of workers in Scotland had experienced some form of
work-related stress, and 56% said stress levels were much higher than
five years ago.
Most concern was registered in the finance, health service, and
electronics industries which are currently undergoing the most
fundamental of changes; increased competition, efficiency drives
designed to reduce staffing levels, substantial redundancies as a
consequence of the peace dividend, or introduction of new technology.
Sir Brian Pitman, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, forecast in May
that 75,000 jobs would be lost in banking during the next three to four
years.
Work-related stress comes in two main forms -- physiological and
psychological.
Physiological injuries -- that manifest in the shape of back pain,
migraine, muscle cramp generally caused by inordinately heavy workloads
for sustained periods, or constant repetitive movements resulting in RSI
(Repetitive Strain Injury) -- have been around for a considerable time
and are more commonly known.
Psychological injury is a relatively new work-related ill-health
phenomenon which appears to be escalating at an alarming rate and, in
some industries, it is in danger of reaching epidemic levels.
Last year MSF was called upon to provide legal support through the
civil courts for a local member who suffered from RSI, and we were
successful in obtaining for the industrial radiographer a compensation
settlement of #72,000 -- the first case of its kind in Scotland.
More recently we have been involved in assisting members who have
suffered psychological injury, in particular negotiating early
retirement packages for an electronics worker who suffered from Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis (ME) and an insurance worker who developed nervous
anxiety due to workplace stress.
It is this psychological damage, which can be more traumatic and
permanent, that we believe will become more prevalent and demand greater
attention from workers' representative organisations.
After a Blyth social worker successfully took his employer to court
and won a #200,000 damages claim (he had suffered two nervous breakdowns
arising from work pressure) -- Walker versus Northumberland County
Council -- employers should now recognise their ''duty of care'' under
the Health &amp; Safety at Work legislation. This duty of care goes beyond
providing a hard hat or a guard on a machine.
MSF members in the industries surveyed recognised a more belligerent
attitude by bosses and senior managers more interested in sales,
production, and job cuts than health.
On being asked to describe attitude to work -- dissatisfied, contented
or neither -- 39% of workers felt dissatisfied. Paul Walker, assistant
director of the CBI, said: ''Employers in a highly competitive working
environment are forced to contain costs or face going out of business.''
These comments would appear to indicate that employee dissatisfaction
and occupational stress will continue to rise.
On a more positive note, while most employers would appear to be
taking an obdurate Pontius Pilate approach, some companies (too few for
my liking) are showing a genuine concern over this new workplace
illness.
Two major employers in the insurance industry -- Scottish Widows' Fund
and Scottish Provident in Edinburgh -- not only have the personnel
departments acting in a responsible and positive manner to assist staff
who complain about work pressure and stress, but they have also agreed
to work in partnership with MSF in joint discussions on work systems and
how work is managed. They have accepted our premise that prevention is
better than cure.
It is that type of sensible approach and philosophy that the MSF union
is encouraging as we firmly believe that although there may be an
increasingly competitive environment in every industry, employers will
need to adopt a new ethos towards the health and welfare of employees.
The Walker case could be the first of many substantial compensation
claims if employers choose to ignore the scale of recent problems. After
all, the case against the Industrial Deafness Scheme, which has paid out
more than #600m in compensation, began with just one claim brought by a
shipbuilding worker in Southampton in the 1960s.
Employers and their insurers would do well to pay as much regard in
future to health and safety as they do to profit margins and efficiency
drives.

THE cri de coeur from Jack Angus deserves a serious response (July 3).
His is a question that every young Briton has voiced for many years --
and one most often answered in a way designed to confuse rather than to
clarify.
People say that socialism has failed precisely because socialism has
failed. It has failed -- inevitably and painfully.
The full reasons would fill a book but there is one quite fundamental
cause that underlies all the failures and which must result in the same
conclusion no matter where and when socialism might be tried -- or what
name it might be given.
Socialism is, in reality, a religion and, like other religions, it is
based on faith. Many religions believe in a Supreme Being with
attributes that vary according to the religion concerned.
Socialism however, is a totally secular superstition. Its tenets lie
in what it conceives to be logic and its fundamental motivation is based
on the false assumption that people are perfect.
Regrettably, we have still a very long way to go before we can even
hope to start claiming that we are morally, socially, or intellectually
perfect.
By definition, therefore, albeit superficially attractive in theory,
socialism cannot work in practice. However, the practitioners of this
cult, just like the followers of any other flawed theory, will go to
extreme lengths to perpetuate the myth.
Consequently we find that more and more regulation is necessary in
order to make people conform to the all-pervasive demands of the faith.
This means, necessarily, more and more bureaucracy.
However, only a limited number of people in a given country are
morally, intellectually, and practically capable of managing a
bureaucracy that does not oppress the very people it is claimed to
serve. Thus the system falls into the hands of unqualified
''administrators''.
Nepotism, incompetence, corruption, prejudice, tyranny, and
mind-manipulation follow as night follows day.
The political system becomes skewed in such a way that it becomes
increasingly difficult for even a democratic electorate to rid itself of
the incubus.
Over time, the population becomes conditioned to acceptance of, and
eventual dependence on, Authority; and this can reach the point at which
the people no longer have the initiative to fend for themselves but look
to the State -- or to anyone other than themselves -- for the
necessities of life.
They look to preferment within the system for the luxuries of life.
This attitude can become so deeply ingrained that the absence of any
sense of personal responsibility can persist for generations after the
burden of socialism is removed by the operation of external forces.
One last point. Mr Angus and others appear to regard communism as an
extreme form of socialism. I recommend that they consult the two
definitions in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. They will find
that socialism is recognised to be much more wide-ranging and ambitious
than communism.
It represents the response of communists to their failure to achieve;
and, as I mention above, they do not respond by backing off from failure
and thinking that they might just be wrong but rather they go to even
further extremes in the enforcement of their beliefs.
Mr Angus might reflect upon the degree to which the people of this
country display the characteristics described above. This is after 16
years of government by a political faith diametrically opposed to the
beliefs of socialism but equally blindly convinced of its own
righteousness and equally inclined to got to extremes in order to have
its own way.
If he does, he may just discern the answer to his own question.

HOW right was Jack Angus to question the death of socialism (July 3).
As long as we continue to have faith in a truly humane society, free of
exploitation, competition, war, starvation and poverty, and alienation
then socialism lives.
But there have been attempts at socialism within individual states
(such as Russia, China, etc) and these have failed, not because of some
weakness of human nature, as its enemies suggest, but primarily because
the historical circumstances were otherwise -- including the acceptance
of the Stalinists (who were the dominant tendency) of trying to impose
socialism from the top and alongside capitalism.
This experiment was wrong in theory and practice, and it is certainly
ludicrous to talk of ''the collapse of communism'' as the media
mandarins keep inanely repeating.
These commentators want it both ways. The dictatorships have been
eliminated, the say; yet in a communist society organisation will be
controlled by the workers, without a political state apparatus. And this
clearly was not the case in the so-called communist countries.
Communism, in reality, never collapsed, because it never existed.
As well as having the faith in this future communism, we need again to
organise to bring it about, but ensuring that the revolution must make
capitalism redundant on a world scale, whether it begins in Glasgow or
London, Los Angeles or Johanesburg.

AT last the acute strategy has been unveiled by Greater Glasgow Health
Board. The Victoria Infirmary and Stobhill Hospital are secure for the
time being. But the board is going out to consultation on the clinical
specialisation and rationalisation with reactions and responses being
sought by September 30, 1995. Why does consultation always seem to be
necessary during the peak holiday period?
The following specialities will be located thus:
Ophthalmology: two in-patient units will be sited at West Glasgow and
the Southern General hospitals, as will dermatology; oral and
maxillofacial surgery will be sited at the Royal Infirmary or the
Southern General Hospital; plastic surgery will be relocated from
Canniesburn Hospital to the Royal Infirmary; and infectious diseases
will be relocated from Ruchill Hospital to Gartnavel Hospital.
As for hospital closures, the Western Infirmary is not deemed a
closure but a relocation at a cost of #100m. Rutherglen Maternity,
however, is to close, despite over 61,000 signatures in support of its
retention.
We are concerned by the board's assumptions on bed usage, especially
when it admits to an increasing demand for admission to hospitals. There
was an increase of 1% in in-patient usage in 1994.
Day cases grew more rapidly than expected. The revised estimate of
60,000 day patients to be treated represents an increase of 8000 cases.
The board is awaiting with anxiety the Scottish review of SHARE
allocation. If this follows the English formula, money will be moved
from inner cities, very bad news for Glasgow.
We have some sympathy with the board realising the appalling financial
constraints it is under, but it must fight its corner in a much more
agressive manner.

I HAVE hit upon a solution to the Brent Spar problem which could not
only boost Scottish tourism but bring to an end at least some of the
bickering that has recently sullied the atmosphere in Glasgow's City
Chambers.
Why don't Glasgow City Council purchase this Kraken structure -- I'm
sure they could get it for a knock-down price -- spruce it up a bit,
install a revolving restaurant at the top, then situate it in the old
Garden Festival site? Thus ends the problem of what to do with the
redundant ex-dockyards.
Some may protest that this would be inappropriate as the Brent Spar
wasn't actually built at any of the extinct Clyde shipyards, and this
would be fair comment.
But I believe it could be symbolic of the spirit of the people of
Glasgow who would gladly have built it if only their shipping industry
hadn't been dumped at sea by a Government which successfully managed to
cut costs without bothering too much about the environmentally
unfriendliness of an ever-growing underclass.
Underwater. Underclass. As long as it's out of sight. There we are.
Problem solved.

I BELIEVE it is vitally important that people should know who is
governing them, how they are being governed, why the legislators do the
things they do, and I am interested in the composition of the Prime
Minister's new Cabinet, but I wonder how many agree with me that it
would be refreshing if, for even one day now and again, we could have a
Herald containing political news confined to a single column.
Having worked in the political arena for two decades and having
observed from the sidelines the antics of politicians for even longer, I
am convinced that most readers are interested only in the results, not
the hyperbole, speculation, jealousy, envy, and mistrust that go along
with them, especially from nonentities on the back benches desperate for
their 30 seconds of media fame.

THERE is a perversity about present-day political commentating which
must be deliberate, since it seems so simplistic that it could not
otherwise go undetected. Currently it manifests itself as attaching a
''right-wing'' label to any group or individual who oppose European
integration.
As a ''small c'' conservative with highly attuned and socially
englightened tendencies, I deeply resent this. The instinct to preserve
our sovereignty is a national thing, and nothing to do with the
''rights'' and ''lefts'' of politics.
Peter Shore and his anti-marketeers were always regarded as being on
the left of the Labour movement, and personally, ''rightist'' as I am
conventionally called, I would take up the cudgels for Tony Blair
tomorrow if he gave a firm commitment to keep us out of an integrated
Europe and a common currency.

DAVID HEPBURN'S letter only touches on a few of CalMac's peccadilloes
(June 29).
He does not, for instance, mention that one can take a bicycle on the
five-hour journey to Barra for #1 but it will cost #2 to take it on the
10-minute journey to the Cumbrae. The five-mile journey from Gourock to
Dunoon for a car and driver will cost #7.60, which contrasts strangely
with #5.90 for the same car and driver to make the 500 yard crossing
from Colintraive to Bute.
The service which CalMac gives to the Western Isles has been praised.
I do not think that many people will give the same praise to the service
they provide in the Clyde and there is no doubt that, were it nor for
Western Ferries' competition, we would have an even worse service.

A COUNCIL official who tricked her employers out of more than #56,000
was saved from jail yesterday by a sheriff's compassion for her infant
son and unborn baby.
Margaret Fyfe, 27, a single mother, of Inchaffray Street, Perth, was
appearing at Perth Sheriff Court for sentence after admitting embezzling
the cash while employed by Perth and Kinross District Council.
Sheriff John McInnes said that a prison sentence would normally be
inevitable for a breach of trust on such a scale.
But after hearing that Fyfe had an 11-month-old son and was expecting
another child in September, he told her: ''I am very anxious that your
children should not be deprived of their mother in the early months of
their lives.''
Sentencing her to 240 hours of community service and three years
probation, he said: ''I regard your personal circumstances as making
this an entirely exceptional case. In the ordinary course you would have
gone to prison for a very considerable period.''
He warned Fyfe: ''What has happened today in no way exempts you from
your liability to make restitution to the council and it may well be
that you will be sequestrated and be left without your present house.
But that is something you can rue at your leisure.''
The court was told that while working in the council's housing
benefits office Fyfe made claims for non-existent tenants. After she
entered details in the computer system payments for the bogus applicants
were made regularly to her bank account.
The scam worked for five years until a fellow employee noticed that
cheques for different claimants were being channelled to the same
account. Only #750 of the money was recovered.
Fyfe, now unemployed, left the court in tears.

THE holiday plans of Scots look likely to be the first casualty of a
series of 24-hour strikes by BR train drivers. The whole Scottish rail
network will grind to a halt on Friday, July 14, the first day of the
Glasgow Fair.
Originally scheduled for next Tuesday, the first strike date has had
to be changed because of successful legal action by the Cardiff Railway
Company which said it had not received the statutory seven days' notice
from the train drivers' union Aslef.
Widespread disruption caused by the one-day stoppage may also
overspill on to services running late the day before or early on the
morning after the strike, rail companies warned yesterday. A second
one-day strike is due to take place the following Tuesday, July 18.
ScotRail said all services will be cancelled on both dates and said
the knock on effect of the strike will affect the running of sleeper
trains to London for a number of days. Special trains laid on for the
Scottish Open at Carnoustie and the Parade of Tall Ships will also be
cancelled.
ScotRail director Mr John Ellis said yesterday that holidaymakers in
Glasgow would be particularly badly hit by the industrial action. ''We
obviously regret having to cancel any services.''
''This industrial action will devastate our sleeper services. We will
only be able to operate on one night between next Thursday and the
following Wednesday. I cannot apologise enough to our customers.''
The strike is also expected to provoke a stampede for trains leaving
Scotland the day before. But travellers hoping to start their holidays
before the rail network grinds to a halt were warned to check connecting
services.
InterCity West Coast said services to and from London are expected to
run normally on Thursday, including those that complete their journey
after midnight. But the company warned passengers that no trains will
run on the Friday and that some connecting services may be affected late
on Thursday night.
The decision by the train drivers' union Aslef to switch dates follows
a legal challenge from Cardiff Railway Company which said it had not
received the proper seven-day notice of strike action after last week's
ballot in favour of stoppages.
The union said the other strikes will go ahead on July 18 and 27,
August 8 and 25, and September 12.
Following the recent High Court decision which prevented the National
Union of Mineworkers from staging a stoppage at pits owned by RJB Mining
because of a technicality over just what constitutes a full seven days,
Aslef decided to err of the side of safety and delay its initial action
for several days.
Aslef general secretary Mr Lew Adams said: ''We greatly regret any
inconvenience which this change may cause to people who were already
making arrangements for our original strike date. We had no
alternative.''
The strikes, a protest against a ''final'' pay offer of 3%, are
expected to cripple much of the network for the second summer in
succession. Members of the Rail, Maritime, and Transport unions are
currently balloting on similar action over the offer. The result should
be known tomorrow.

''IT'S not a bloody panto, you know; you're not here to enjoy
yourself.'' Thus spake Papageno in Tuesday night's touring production of
The Magic Flute by The Opera Company. Actually, Mozart's vaudeville is
the closest opera will come to pantomime and the audience certainly did
enjoy themselves.
Comparisons may not always be appropriate but on this occasion, The
Opera Company are following a difficult act in Martin Duncan's
marvellous Scottish Opera production. Without taking away any of the
enthusiasm with which The Opera Company were met, I can only assume that
many of Tuesday night's audience never saw the ScotOp success.
That said, The Opera Company made a valiant attempt to convert any
ScotOp devotees. Not fresh but rather refreshing, theirs is a comical
yet essentially emotional interpretation. Director Clare Venables has a
mature grasp on theatrical impact, and her chosen emphases -- acceptance
and morality -- served to pace the dramatic action. Simply set, focusing
on the three step-ladders symbolising the three pillars of virtue, it
was the striking use of lighting which brought the stage to life.
Musically, the score sat well under the baton of Nicholas Kok. Tempos
remained lightning-fast throughout but the young singers and orchestra
took it in their stride. Principal roles played to perfection, it was
Papageno who stole the show, Howard Quilla Croft voicing the hilarious
part with infectious charm. Central lovers Tamino and Pamina, Andrew
MacKenzie-Wicks and Charlotte Page respectively, are promising voices,
not forgetting a dazzling Queen of the Night in Cara O'Sullivan.
The Opera Company have made their mark. A vital vehicle for fresh
young talent, Scottish Opera take note.

REPUTATIONS are not built merely on talent, otherwise Brian Kellock
would be a main stage attraction at this and many another jazz festival.
That sort of recognition takes a certain amount of pushiness and to
date, Kellock's ambitions have remained piano- rather than career-based.
He claims to have a talent for composition equivalent to John
Redwood's grasp of the Welsh national anthem, which when you hear
Kellock construct a solo as on Kenny Barron's Voyage, with its huge
build-up of tension and eventual, surging release, makes you proffer the
other leg.
It's also typical of Kellock's modesty that the first time we heard
him here it was part of, essentially, a quartet led by this year's
composer-in-residence, Bobby Wellins. Ridiculously underappreciated
heretofore, Wellins doesn't show off. Even on a borrowed tenor (ouch,
sorry!) he produced that trademark, almost bleak tone which makes the
fastidiously chosen notes he plays all the more emotional.
Wellins gave us considered power; when the Kellock trio took over, we
got fireworks, with drummer Mike Bradley pushing his leader hard and
bassist Kenny Ellis at ease in the Mr Reliable role. We also got
delicacy in the shape of Tadd Dameron's beautiful ballad, If You Could
See Me Now.
By way of a coda, Wellins and guitarist Randy Johnston joined in for
Monk's Rhythm-a-ning and a blues, the guitarist confirming a fearlessly
prodigious talent hinted at during his earlier, rather jet-lagged solo
spot. The last word, though, goes to Kellock, who the way he is playing
these days makes you look forward to his every solo the way a wean does
to Christmas.

Rob Adams talks to jazz guitarist John McLaughlin about his career and
the secret of his latest group's inspiration
IT'S fortunate that musicians, unlike other professionals, don't rely
on written references from their former bosses. Miles Davis's
autobiography contains his summing up of guitarist John McLaughlin in an
expression that is obviously intended as the ultimate compliment, but
reads like the complete opposite (and isn't the sort of thing to be
repeated in a family newspaper).
McLaughlin on Davis is equally enthusiastic, if more conventionally
respectful (''the most honest man I ever met''), and even 26 years after
the event he still gives an almost palpable sense of how it felt to be
recording Davis's In A Silent Way album just two days after arriving in
New York.
Suddenly McLaughlin was confronted by his boyhood hero. Suddenly the
career he had started in Yorkshire as a 16-year-old in a traditional
jazz band and continued in London with Georgie Fame's Blue Flames, Brian
Auger's Trinity and the Graham Bond Organisation had brought him to the
court of the biggest-selling and most influential figure in jazz.
Suddenly he had his chance, and on those initial sessions, and on the
subsequent Bitches Brew and the brilliant but often overlooked Jack
Johnson album (Davis's all-time favourite), McLaughlin took it -- hence
Davis's characteristic endorsement.
McLaughlin had gone to New York to play with drummer Tony Williams,
the pair having met while McLaughlin was playing in the house band at
Ronnie Scott's and Williams was passing through London with Davis's
band. Williams's new group, Lifetime, was also to include Jack Bruce, an
old colleague of McLaughlin's from Graham Bond's band, and organist
Larry Young.
McLaughlin spent two turbo-charged years with Lifetime and credits
Williams for encouraging him to write, many of his compositions being
sketches for the band that was to really establish McLaughlin's name in
1971, the Mahavishnu Orchestra.
By this time McLaughlin, who had already begun purging his body of
booze and ''sixties substances'' by taking up yoga in 1967, had become a
devotee of the guru Sri Chimnoy, who suggested the name Mahavishnu,
meaning ''divine compassion, power and justice''.
He certainly got the power part right as the band at the forefront of
jazz/rock fusion worked up an almost overwhelming ferment, famously
causing a BBC2 In Concert recording to be halted due to unsafe decibel
levels.
McLaughlin displays the enthusiasm of a fan rather than the bandleader
when talking about the original Mahavishnu line-up, which comprised
drummer Billy Cobham, bass guitarist Rick Laird, electric violinist
Jerry Goodman, and keyboardist Jan Hammer, whom McLaughlin plucked from
singer Sarah Vaughan's band and who went on to write the music for TV's
Miami Vice.
That line-up lasted two years before surrendering to the strains of
massive success and internal conflict. But the Mahavishnu Orchestra
continued in various other forms and with varying degrees of musical
success until 1975 when McLaughlin formed the all-acoustic Shakti with a
group of leading Indian musicians including violinist L Shankar and
tabla player Zakir Hussein.
Around the same time McLaughlin left Sri Chimnoy's movement (he
continues to meditate and chant but follows no particular religion). ''I
wouldn't say he'd focused me as far as my work was concerned,'' says
McLaughlin, taking a break from mixing a newly-recorded CD looking back
through his career.
''Being in Manhattan focused me because I just felt that my time was
coming up and I'd better be ready for it. However, it was a very intense
period and Sri Chimnoy changed the way I approached my life and I've
continued on that way since then.''
Although quieter than Mahavishnu, Shakti was no less intense or
exciting, with McLaughlin (who had been studying Indian vocal music
since 1970) and Shankar exchanging lines of astonishing speed and
directness. This partnership continued after Shakti's demise as
McLaughlin launched the electric One Truth Band and began a pattern of
alternating between electric and acoustic guitar, often playing the
latter with fellow guitarists Paco de Lucia and Al Dimeola, sometimes
deserting one style for years while concentrating on the other.
With his current group, The Free Spirits, McLaughlin plays electric
guitar, having concentrated for the previous five years on acoustic in
his trio which featured Indian percussionist Trilok Gurtu, with whom his
Indian vocal studies were again put to good, almost telepathic, use.
That group, with Jeff Berlin on bass guitar, provided one of Glasgow
International Jazz Festival's greatest concerts in 1988.
The Free Spirits, with drummer Dennis Chambers, finds McLaughlin
working once again with a Hammond organist as Joey DeFrancesco joins a
long line that began with Georgie Fame in 1960. DeFrancesco was
recommended to McLaughlin by Miles Davis (using that same term he used
about McLaughlin) and as well as organ plays trumpet in a very
Davis-like way.
''I've loved all my groups,'' says McLaughlin. ''But I really hope
this one will stay together for a long time. We all do other things: for
instance last year I recorded my album of Bill Evans's music, Dennis
toured with Steely Dan, and Joey has his own trio in the States. But
when we get together we have a really good time and in the end this is
it. If the musicians get inspired from playing together and they have
room to be who they really are, it shows in the music.''
* The Free Spirits play McEwan's Old Fruitmarket, Glasgow, tomorrow.

EVERYONE who has heard him will agree that Arturo Sandoval is the
consumate jazz trumpeter. But he's rather more than that. For a start
there is every chance that you have heard him -- on movie soundtracks or
on Gloria Estefan records -- even if you have no great love for jazz. He
has also recently revived a classical career -- which had gone into
abeyance after he co-founded the top Cuban band Irakere -- with concerto
recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra.
A few weeks ago it was Sandoval and his band, The Latin Train, who
were asked to play in Central Park at the premiere screening of Disney's
new animated film Pocahontas. For all his technique, Sandoval's music
has a wide appeal.
Scottish audiences have had good opportunities to hear how
breathtaking he can be, both with his own band (he was
artist-in-residence at the Glasgow Jazz Festival in 1991), and in the
late Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra. Towards the end of his
life Gillespie was happy to let younger men take the soloing strain in
the band, and Sandoval's blistering runs and high-note playing would all
but stop the show.
He had been Gillespie's protege -- legend has it that Sandoval
volunteered to drive for him when Gillespie played a concert in Havana
-- and it was a gig with the United Nation Orchestra in Rome in 1990
that gave Sandoval the opportunity to defect from Cuba. Because it was a
long tour he had persuaded the authorities to allow his wife and son to
join him. When the family were safely in London, Gillespie pulled some
strings at the White House (having been a goodwill ambassador for the US
in the 1950s) and political asylum was granted.
''Every time I play, every record I make, I do one of his pieces. It
is not a tribute but a way of keeping his music -- his legacy --
alive,'' says Sandoval. He and his family now all live in Miami. Only
his sister remains in Cuba since his parents made a brave trip on an
overcrowded fishing boat to join him at the beginning of 1993. Arturo
Sandoval Snr was 70 years old at the time and his wife Cira broke three
vertebrae on the voyage.
The trumpeter is not allowed to go back to the island and has little
wish to. (''The situation is horrible. The people are starving and
homeless.'') But he also has no inclination to move to a part of the US
where he would be nearer the bulk of his work, like New York or the West
Coast.
''It is horrible to be afraid, and I would be somewhere else. I like
it here -- there are more than a million Cubans here. It is wonderful
city. They are shooting movies here and there are galleries, the opera,
and the ballet. The city is getting better all the time.
''But I don't play much here in Miami because jazz is not too popular.
It is more salsa and other Latin music. Still, there's nothing wrong
with that.''
After the special role Dizzy Gillespie had played in his life, the
veteran jazzman's death in 1993 hit Sandoval particularly hard, and he
has refused to be involved in anything that might tarnish his mentor's
reputation.
''Different people talked to me about keeping the United Nation
Orchestra going, but when Diz passed away so did the soul of the
orchestra. They used the name once but it wasn't right.''
Gillespie must rest easy knowing his legacy is in such safe hands.
* Arturo Sandoval and The Latin Train appear at the McEwan's
Fruitmarket tonight.

Former sergeant knocked out by footballer makes #750,000 claim against
force and club.
THE career of a woman police sergeant was wrecked when a Celtic player
crashed into her during a football match and knocked her unconscious, a
judge heard yesterday.
Former sergeant Rachel Gillon, who became a police cadet at the age of
16, is claiming #750,000 from the Chief Constable of Strathclyde, and
Airdrie Football Club, where she was injured in November 1991.
Lord Coulsfield heard at the Court of Session that, at the time of the
incident at an Airdrie v Celtic game, Mrs Gillon, 35, was on crowd
control round the park perimeter.
She said she had been instructed that this meant facing the crowd at
all times and that officers seen watching the game would be liable for
disciplinary measures. As she was walking the perimeter track, watching
the crowd, a fight broke out. By radio she instructed two colleagues to
deal with that incident and stood facing the crowd as she had been
instructed.
''Suddenly and without warning'', she was hit from behind with great
force by Tony Cascarino as he chased after a ball that had run off the
field of play. She was knocked out and woke up in Monklands District
Hospital in great pain. She was sent home after being X-rayed but later
felt considerable pain in her upper body, right lower back, and right
leg which restricted her freedom of movement.
She returned to work in March 1992, carrying out only light duties,
but because of continuing pain went on sick leave on May 1. She was
medically retired from the police force in December that year and has
not been able to work since.
Mrs Gillon, a mother of two boys aged one and seven, of Glencairn
Road, Langbank, Renfewshire, claims that, since the Broomfield incident,
her life has changed for the worse. She can no longer swim or jog or
enjoy the pleasure of a rough and tumble with her young son. She gave
birth to another son in July last year and said that the extra activity
involved in looking after the baby had caused her further discomfort and
distress.
She said the only medical treatment available was the continued use of
pain-killing tablets and physiotherapy, which provided only short-term
relief. She also alleged that she had become ''morose, depressed,
anxious, and upset'' because she had to give up her promising career in
which she was earning #21,500 a year and her promotion prospects were
first rate.
According to Mrs Gillon, her personality had changed from being a
successful, contented person to being introspective, occasionally
disorganised, and irritable.
In her action, she blamed the chief constable on the basis that it was
his responsibility to devise a safe system of work for officers under
his command when they were policing football grounds. She said he should
have ensured that staff patrolling football grounds had instructions to
pay attention from time to time to what was happening on the field of
play, particularly because of the physical limitations of Airdrie's
Broomfield ground.
If this had been the policy, Mrs Gillon claimed, she might have become
aware of the looming collision with Cascarino, who has since left the
club, and avoided the accident.
In her claim against Airdrie, she said the club should also have taken
reasonable care for the safety of police working at the ground. She
contended that the track surrounding the field of play at Broomfield was
extremely narrow and that there was no separation of the perimeter track
and the pitch.
She argued that a number of measures could have been taken, such as
widening the track, building a small segregation barrier, or placing
advertising hoardings between the field of play and the running track.
Airdrie denied liability and Mr Derek Emslie, QC, counsel for the
club, asked Lord Coulsfied to dismiss Mrs Gillon's claims as irrelevant
on four grounds. He argued that there were no relevant claims to
indicate:
* That there was a foreseeable risk of injury.
* That the failure to build a separating wall or barrier at the edge
of the pitch represented a failure on Airdrie's part to take reasonable
care.
* That a failure to widen the track at Broomfield represented a
failure to take reasonable care.
* There were no sufficiently specific claims to indicate how and by
how much the track should have been widened.
In the case against the chief constable, who also denied liability, it
has been agreed that evidence should be heard in Mrs Gillon's claim.
Lord Coulsfield will give his decision in writing later.

IF the rail strikes go ahead they will be a gross betrayal of all the
people who opposed the rail cuts. Strikes will cause enormous hardship
to travellers, including tourists who may never return.
They will cause serious damage to BR's finances and lead to even more
draconian cuts. Is that what the rail workers want?
Strikes will drive many people to BR's competitors, some never to
return.
The public, while supporting the rail unions' case, must demand that
both sides go to arbritation immediately. Failing that, unions should be
told to find other ways of pursuing their just cause without depriving
passengers of their trains.
If the public does not take action to stop the strikes, if they do
take place, it will have to accept the catastrophic economic and
environmental consequences of the decline in the railways.
The rail workers should publish details of all the hassles they are
getting as a result of privatisation.

* IT sounds like Scotland's answer to Ascot. Ladies' Night at Hamilton
Park Racecourse tomorrow. It's the fourth year of the event -- and the
first in support of The Herald Foundation for Women's Health. Horses and
hats? A heady combination -- and there is much else besides.
The serious business of racing starts at 6.30pm with the Lady Amateur
Riders' Handicap. Normally there are only six races on a card but
permission has been given for this appropriate addition. Some celebrity
riders are promised. The other races -- with professional jockeys, men
or women -- run at half-hourly intervals till 9.30.
The last of the events is the tantalisingly named Flowerscene Dozen
Red Roses Maiden Handicap. Leading jockeys come from as far afield as
the North of England and Newmarket. They include Kevin Darley, who rode
the favourite, Celtic Swing, in last weekend's Irish Derby (he was
unplaced); Jason Weaver; and John Carroll, who is retained by Jack
Berry, the champion two-year-old trainer.
While serious punters are pondering form, the more frivolous racegoers
have many distractions. The prettiest hat competition for a start. Form
here ranges from ''the classic to the crazy,'' says the racecourse's
chief executive, Hazel Dudgeon. She points out that many racegoers take
a lot of care dressing even for a normal day's racing, particularly if
they are in the club enclosure.
To even matters up between the sexes, there is also a prize for the
best-dressed couple, donated by the Copthorne Hotel, Glasgow.
For the first time on ladies' night at Hamilton Park there will be a
tented village (shades of the Open) to add to people's enjoyment between
races. With a range of the latest fashions shown off by models, lingerie
and swimwear, jewellery, perfumes, not to mention floral art
demonstrations, a display of the latest Volvo range, and an exhibition
of paintings, there is no excuse for being bored. All this and the
Uptown Shufflers jazz band.
Racegoing would hardly be complete without champagne and at Hamilton
Park on Friday this will come half-price, thanks to caterers Letheby and
Christopher who are thus promoting their own premium cuvee champagne in
their marquee.
Should the weather break, rain will not be allowed to spoil the
evening. ''We carry on regardless,'' says Hazel Dudgeon, ''and there is
plenty of shelter.''
Dudgeon is in her third season at Hamilton. She comes from Kirkliston,
Lothian, and herself rides in point-to-points in the spring season.
* DOCTORS need help too. A new 24-hour Helpline for doctors with drink
or drug problems began this month. The service is backed up by a network
of counsellors around the country, including doctors who are former
addicts, says a report in the current issue of GP magazine.
The telephone will be manned by retired GP Dr Ian Joiner from Farnham,
Surrey, secretary of the British Doctors and Dentists' Group, a support
group for doctors suffering addiction problems. The number to ring is:
01252 316976.
* DIRTY lens cases may be the source of serious eye disease. A study
has found that up to 80% of contact lens cases contain organisms which
may cause disease according to research carried out at Moorfields Eye
Hospital, London. They say that standard cleaning practices failed to
eradicate organisms in most cases, and recommend that lens cases are
changed once a year.
* RELATIVES and friends of accident victims often need counselling to
come to terms with the loss. Now the Sudden Death Support Association
has opened a 24-hour telephone support service. Telephone: 01734 790790.
* THE British Longevity Society has produced two educational booklets
written by a GP and gerontologist. It Makes Sense and Brain Matters in
Later Life offer coping strategies for the problems of ageing and those
suffering from memory loss. Each cost #2.50. from the society at PO Box
71, Northampton NNl 5HJ.
* MORE than 1000 schoolchildren in Tayside region are to have their
teeth coated in a special varnish to see if it will help reduce tooth
decay. The three-year trial using Chlorzoin will cost #500,000 says a
report in the Scottish Dentist.
* MENINGITIS, whether it results in a fatality or not, can bring a
great deal of trauma and distress to the family involved. For that
reason the National Meningitis Trust offers help via their 24-hour
Support Line. Telephone: 01345 538118.
* THE classic signs of heart failure are breathlessness, swollen legs
or ankles and constant tiredness, yet many people are unaware of this,
says the Family Heart Association which is launching a campaign to raise
awareness of heart failure. A recent survey found that 80% of the
population were unaware of these early signs.
* A STUDY of more than 87,000 women has found no relationship between
silicone breast implants, rheumatoid arthritis and other tisssue
disorders, says a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.

EVERY DAY two or three children die as a result of an accident. Every
year one in five children is treated in hospital as a result of
injuries. Every year more than 35,000 children are killed or injured on
the roads.
These statistics are shocking, and despite identification of the
situations generating them accidents are still on-going for various
reasons.
There has been a lot of progress regarding extra seat belts in cars,
mini-bus safety, improvement playgrounds and drug and solvent awareness.
Parents have had to accept that recreational drug use is rife and adjust
their thinking accordingly. Children need to be given straightforward
information on the effects of drugs, and in doing so helped to make
responsible choices.
Activity holidays are another area which has caused much concern in
the past, with some terrible tragedies drawing attention to poor
standards of care and supervision. A new law comes into effect this
summer setting up a licensing system to regulate activity holidays.
Playgrounds are another minefield. Rusty slides, broken swings and
perilously high climbing frames are made even more dangerous if located
on unsafe ground. It is usually worried parents who have forced relevant
authorities to rectify the dangers.
Likewise, car and bus travel is being made more safe as a result of
years of parental campaigning. Due to public demand, manufacturers of
the most popular vehicles are now producing cars with three three-point
belts in the rear seat. Within the year, seat belts are to be made
obligatory on all new EC mini-buses and coaches.
The subject of private transport provides uncomfortable details of the
accident rates for child pedestrians in this country. With one of the
highest levels in the EC, one in 15 children in the UK can expect to be
injured in a road accident by the age of 16. Safety campaigns aimed at
both children and drivers have had little effect in recent years,
neither have local traffic calming measures. In an attempt to highlight
and reduce these dangers and many more, the Child Accident Prevention
Trust has launched Child Safety Week running until Sunday. The following
rules are being promoted.
1. Plan and practise a safer route to school.
2. Use a car seat that fits your child and your car.
3. Fit and check a smoke alarm.
4. Use a harness and reins when out and about with a toddler.
5. Keep household products and medicines locked up or out of reach.
6. Plan your next safety move -- keep one step ahead as your baby
grows.
7. Check your safety equipment -- does it fit and does it work?
The trust is encouraging adults to tackle one of the steps this week,

A PACKED programme of talent was unveiled yesterday in Edinburgh as
the Fringe programme for three of the festival's main arts venues was
launched.
Sponsored by beer company Stella Artois, the programme covers hundreds
of shows and acts at the Assembly Rooms, the Gilded Balloon, and the
Pleasance Theatre.
Among the top names scheduled to appear during the three-week Fringe
is former Kinks singer and guitarist Ray Davies, who will be live and
unplugged at the Assembly Rooms.
Other stars on the Assembly Rooms agenda are Spitting Image's Kate
Robbins, former Neighbours actor and now presenter of The Big Breakfast
Mark Little, and comedians Greg Proops and Simon Fanshawe. Julian Clary
will be back with a new show.
The venue will also host the late-night party Club Latino.
Dunoon jazz diva Suzanne Bonnar is one of the headline acts at the
Gilded Balloon, as are established comedy stars Sean Hughes, Phil Kay,
and Alan Davies.
Former Crystal Maze presenter, and writer of the Rocky Horror Show,
Richard O'Brien, will appear as an evangelistic demon in the production
Disgracefully Yours at the Pleasance, while TV presenter Annabel Giles
will make her Fringe debut in the one-woman play Looking For Mr Giles.
Programme organiser Mr William Burdett-Coutts revealed that 20,000
tickets would be given away for the three venues during the first week
of the Fringe in August.
''I don't believe anyone at the festival has made such a large gesture
to allow people to attend shows they can't afford,'' he said.

JOHN MAJOR has capped his victory in the Conservative Party leadership
stakes with the most extensive reshuffle of his Premiership. But
compared with Harold Macmillan's night of the long knives there was not
much blood on the floor of the Cabinet room at No 10. He has persuaded
Michael Heseltine to give up his beloved Department of Trade and
Industry for the uncertain pastures of Deputy Prime Minister. History
does not suggest that this is an easy way to revitalise a flagging
Government. The appointment may betray just how unsure Mr Major is of
himself and of the direction his Government should take. But Mr
Heseltine is a man of remarkable resource who may be able to make
bullets without gun metal. The ultimate prize of political life seems to
have passed Mr Heseltine by, leaving the succession, inevitable after a
General Election defeat, to be fought over by the younger generation.
Malcolm Rifkind, the new Foreign Secretary, has gained most from the
reshuffle and is now in one of the top two offices of state from which
traditionally future Prime Ministers have been drawn. No member of the
Government is better qualified to succeed Douglas Hurd than Mr Rifkind,
and it would have been a grave error had the Prime Minister preferred a
placeman on the right, such as Michael Howard, to placate the Redwood
supporters. Europe divides the Conservative Party and the country more
than any other issue. Mr Rifkind now has responsibility for the most
testing issues facing the Government, though the most pressing ones are
Kenneth Clarke's. Following the dubious decision to merge the Employment
Ministry with Education Michael Portillo has moved up a step to the
Ministry of Defence, but Mr Major has been careful not to push him too
far up the ministerial ladder to enhance the right's aspirations to take
over the party leadership. Indeed the right-wing's influence has been
diluted in the new Cabinet. The Prime Minister has not allowed
magnanimity in victory to get the better of sound judgment. The only
concession to the right is the elevation of Michael Forsyth to the
Scottish Office, but this hardly compensates for the departure of John
Redwood and Jonathan Aitken.
Having decided to reward Ian Lang for fronting his re-election
campaign by giving him the Department of Trade and Industry it was
inevitable that the controversial MP for Stirling would take over the
top job in Scotland. Mr Major had no real choice but to pick Mr Forsyth,
who is hardly in the mould of Lord Younger, Malcolm Rifkind, and Ian
Lang. Appointing a figure who arouses such hostility inside and outside
his own party to the most sensitive Ministry in the country is
undoubtedly the biggest gamble of the reshuffle. In Scotland Mr Forsyth
is widely seen as being the bogeyman of the right. The last time he was
at the Scottish Office he displayed a remarkable facility for standing
on toes, not least those of the then Secretary of State, Malcolm
Rifkind. Few in Scottish public life escaped his antagonism, not even
the Civil Service. Now Mr Forsyth's task is to save the Conservative
Party from extinction in Scotland. He has a vested interest in this
since his own seat is one of the most vulnerable in the country, even
before unfavourable boundary changes. There is no doubting the man's
talent or that he is at his best when he faces a real challenge. The
local government map of Scotland could not be more hostile. If he is to
justify the Prime Minister's confidence and avert disaster for his party
he will have to draw on rarely seen reserves of diplomacy and
persuasion.
But his speech at the Scottish Conservative Conference this year did
suggest a more conciliatory style.
As the new Cabinet gets down to business it will soon be evident that
new faces change nothing: the problems their predecessors struggled to
cope with remain the same. All politicians are prisoners of their
circumstances. It is not immediately apparent that the new adminstration
is stronger than the old one. The decision to scrap the Department of
Employment as a separate Ministry tells us a great deal about the
philosophy of its last incumbent, but it displays a remarkable lack of
concern about one of the most serious problems facing European states.
Unemployment is now the worst fear of the middle as well as the working
classes. The insecurity this generates among the supporters of every
political party and none is an important factor in the Government's
failure to generate a feel-good factor. Tax cuts are a doubtful remedy.
Kenneth Clarke is bound to try them as a quick-fix, but his scope is
limited by the state of the public finances. The Chancellor is being
forced to take risks with inflation in pursuit of electoral
considerations. Nothing Mr Major has done will banish the constraints
its past mismanagement has imposed upon the Government.

Stephen McGinty was at the Bafta Scotland fundraising night when some
stars unexpectedly found that the joke was on them
IT was Jimmy Logan's fault. He started it. In his capacity as
''Showbiz Legend and Super Trooper'' he got to read out the raffle
prizes. The shrewd diners at the British Academy of Film and Television
Awards Scotland's fund-raising night entitled Hollywood At The Hilton,
had read the small print which thanked American Airlines for the
flights. The prizes had to be holidays.
But no, the first prize was work as an extra for a day in the next
series of Taggart. And so Jimmy cracked up with laughter, tears
streaming down his face, words coming between gasps. And like a ripple
across a stretch of faces, who before had politely nodded 'Oh, that's a
good prize', the laughs followed. By the time he'd completed the list
the camera man didn't know where to pan to, the audience or Jimmy.
Second prize wasn't two days on Taggart but one day on the set of
Hamish MacBeth. Third prize was a chance to present the BBC news with
Jackie Bird. It was won by Dougie Donnelly, who graciously asked for a
redraw, no doubt unable to get the day off.
Tom Conti was called on to present an award, in honour of Mark
MacManus, to actor James MacPherson. He paid respect to the late actor,
who died in June last year and said: ''He was a tragic example of the
double-edged sword of this profession, which gives you fame and tragedy
at the same time.''
But then he didn't present the award. ''It wasn't in the notes'' he
laughed back to Logan.
It was in the notes that Peter Capaldi would wave his Oscar, but
nobody told him, so it didn't find room in his hand luggage. His recent
success in Hollywood has led to a deal with Pulp Fiction's distributers
Miramax to write and direct his next film, Moon Man.
Mickey Rooney wouldn't have approved. It won't be shot in Scotland and
as the 72-year-old explained via Andrew Byatt's exclusive Hollywood
film, Scots have to make more movies.
''You don't have to call them The Kilt!'' The diminutive actor
explained. He himself loved Scotland. ''You have such wonderful golf
courses.''
Though Hollywood made it's contribution, via the film made by the
director of the Scottish Actor's Studio, the idea was not to celebrate
the fourth of July and American independence, but to attract corporate
sponsors to raise the profile, potential and bank balance of Bafta
Scotland.
It was not known if Mr Jack Black, a kind of mental Mr Motivator had
been enlisted to inspire investors or annoy lazy actors. But his bizarre
brand of mental evangelism found few willing advocates.
He began by asking if he could take off his jacket before speaking.
Judging by the comments in the bar afterwards he should have just
fetched his coat. The idea was to encourage us all to dream like Whoppi
Goldberg dreamed of her Oscar and Ally McCoist dreamed of scoring goals.
''We have to dream bigger dreams.'' Around this point the solitary
laughter from Hans Olson, a Swedish designer working at the Vidal
Sassoon salon, was all around the hall. Hans explained afterwards that
he thought Mr Black was a stand-up comic. ''I kept waiting for the
punch-line.''
After such a fun, good-natured night, the punch-line could come in
November at the Bafta Scotland Awards. It would not be surprising if the
best comedy production award goes back to Bafta Scotland.

Medieval disappointment, a poor attempt at sleazy humour, an insight
into the mind of a comic book writer, and tragedy when fun goes too far.
William Russell examines the latest films
NEW RELEASES
First Knight (PG) directed by Jerry Zucker.
Exit to Eden (18) directed by Garry Marshall.
On general release.
Crumb (18) directed by Terry Zwigoff.
Cameo, Tollcross, Edinburgh.
Fun (18) directed by Rafal Zielinski.
All films open tomorrow.
HOW often do you complain that they don't make films like they used
to? From time to time I certainly do, so, when somebody tries to make
just such a film, it seems churlish to complain that the gift nag is
spavined, has false teeth and is fit only for the glue factory.
Tales involving knights in armour and fair damsels in distress used to
be the staple of popular cinema. But First Knight, Jerry Zucker's
attempt to revive the genre, proves a dismal failure.
If ever there was a misguided movie, this is it. Zucker and his
scriptwriters, who include William Nicholson (Shadowlands), which ought
to have meant quality words, decided to make a film about Camelot, King
Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere, but ditched the whole Arthurian
caboodle. There are many ways of treating the Camelot legend as Mallory,
Tennyson, T.H. White, and Alan Jay Lerner have demonstrated.
Zucker and Nicholson opted to invent a story about a young woman
married to an old man who meets a handsome young man, falls in love with
him, and does nothing about it -- they are too noble -- which makes
nonsense of the legend. Arthur interrupts their goodbye-for-ever kiss,
assumes the worst, and arraigns them for treason, whereupon the villain,
Malagant (Ben Cross in overdrive), bursts in and kills him, allowing the
virtuous lovers to live happily ever after.
There is no Merlin, no Excalibur, no Mordred, no Morgan la Faye, no
adultery, no magic, no romance, just routine swash and buckle.
Admittedly it passes the time well enough, but by the standards of the
sort of movie it tries to recreate it is way below par.
Richard Gere as Lancelot is patently uncomfortable in medieval mode,
and, if truth were told, is at his best when playing rather unpleasant
people, not romantic leads. He strikes endless dashing poses, and hogs
the camera so relentlessly he gives the impression of being a man in
love -- with himself.
Sean Connery as Arthur -- the first Scottish ruler of Camelot --
displays little enthusiasm for a role offering his talents nothing to
latch on to, and stalks around being dignified looking like a thrawn
old-age pensioner whose golf match has just been cancelled.
Julia Ormond is a very beautiful Guinevere, but gets some dreadful
mock medieval dialogue to deliver and clearly thinks Lancelot a bit of a
drag.
On the plus side, the film has been handsomely staged and the
swashbuckling is well handled. But this travesty of the story of Arthur
is a terrible waste of everyone's time and talent.
Anyone who feels like witnessing a lewd act in public need look
further than Exit to Eden, although having taken that advice you may
well be heading in next to no time for the exit to the street. It may
well be a video hit at wife-swapping parties, but that is the best one
can say for this piece of ill-judged soft porn.
Director Garry Marshall, who made Pretty Woman, the film which
glamorised the world of LA prostitution, was clearly trying to make a
risque sex comedy about jaded sado-masochistic swingers seeking
satisfaction on Eden, a fantasy Caribbean island resort where their
tastes are catered for by big-busted women and similarly endowed men in
skimpy beachwear.
Paul Mercurio, the Australian dancer from Strictly Ballroom, plays a
famous photographer who accidentally takes a picture of an international
drug smuggler (Stuart Wilson), who has never been photographed. The
smuggler and his lethal sidekick, Imam, set out to get it back.
Mercurio has a problem. He likes having his bottom smacked with a whip
or possibly a silver-backed hairbrush, as a prelude to sex, and goes on
holiday to Eden where Mistress Lisa (Dana Delaney) is chief dominatrix
to see if he can sort himself out. The LA law, Dan Aykroyd, and a wasted
Rosie O'Donnell, who are after the drug runner, also go along.
The movie is just sleaze from beginning to end. Mr Marshall should be
ashamed of himself, Mr Mercurio should stick to the ballet.
Fans of the comic-book artist, Robert Crumb, who created Fritz the Cat
and Mr Nobody, and whose often-obscene drawings take a distinctly
depressing attitude towards women, will find Crumb provides fascinating
insights into what made him like he is. Directed by Terry Zwigoff, it is
a sad, funny, but wearing experience which probes deeply into his psyche
and that of his family. It would work better, however, as a two- or
three-part television series because then one could occasionally escape
the ghastly Crumb family -- his brothers Charles and Max are even more
peculiar, while his parents are incredible in their sheer awfulness.
Fred Schepisi's splendid not-to-be-missed film of John Guare's Six
Degrees of Separation, reviewed last week and still at Filmhouse, opens
at GFT tomorrow.
GFT is also showing Fun directed by Rafal Zielinski, a chilling tale
about two teenage girls, Renee Humphrey and Alicia Witt giving bravura
performances, who meet and have one of those hysterically naughty days
out.
They work themselves up into such a state that, for fun, they invade
the home of an old woman, planning to rob her to fund more fun, and kill
her. A journalist and a psychiatrist interview them in the remand home
trying to find out why the pair did it. Their answer -- For fun. Is that
reason enough? Probably.

THE crash has once again focused attention on coach and minibus
safety.
It was yet another example of why seatbelts must be fitted urgently,
the Consumers Association said last night.
However, it will be years before all coaches in the UK are fitted with
seatbelts and, in the meantime, older coaches are doing nothing wrong by
operating without belts.
The Government does intend introducing laws to ensure seatbelts are
fitted to every coach and minibus used for transporting children.
That decision followed pressure from parents, including a campaign by
parents in Lanarkshire following a crash which killed two boys near
Biggar in February last year.
In addition, the European Commission plans legislation to ensure all
new coaches and minibuses are fitted with belts, although this will not
become law until next year.
In the meantime, there are no plans for any retrospective fitting of
seatbelts.
Both the Government and the Confederation of Passenger Transport UK
(formerly the Bus and Coach Council) have argued that coach travel is
very safe.
Last March, Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney said, in terms of the
number of miles travelled, coaches and minibuses were twice as safe as
cars. However, he did urge all manufacturers and operators to fit belts
to new vehicles.
The CPT says it encourages seatbelt fitting whenever possible and
points out coaches are regularly inspected by the Department of
Transport.
The Government also announced this year that coaches would be banned
from the outside lane of motorways with three or more lanes in a
two-year trial starting next January. This will coincide with a EU
directive restricting coaches to 65mph.

THE group of Scots, who spearheaded a national campaign on behalf of
victims of asbestos-related diseases forced to repay compensation awards
to the Government, yesterday welcomed a report which said the repayments
were grossly unjust.
Now the STUC and the charity Clydeside Action on Asbestos are
demanding that Parliament amends the law to allow radical changes
unanimously recommended by the all-party Commons Social Security Select
Committee ''without delay''.
Current compensation rules allow the Department of Social Security to
recoup from damages an amount equivalent to total benefits paid to the
victim after an accident or onset of disease.
The select committee's report put forward proposals to end the
''manifest unfairness'' of the system, while protecting the taxpayer.
It stressed that people with asbestos-related conditions should be
treated as special cases and no attempt should be made to recover cash
paid in benefits to them.
The report follows an inquiry into the DSS's Compensation Recovery
Unit, which was set up in 1989. Evidence given to the committee revealed
that one Glasgow man was awarded #30,000. The Compensation Recovery Unit
took #28,000.
The unit is said to be recovering more than #100m a year from
compensation paid for injuries ranging from bomb injuries to asbestosis.
The report said: ''We believe it is unacceptable that damages paid
specifically to compensate a person's pain and suffering should be
recovered to pay for loss of earnings.''
It added: ''Some of the cases we have encountered we believe are
revolting to the ordinary man's sense of injustice.''
It recommended an overhaul of the system and urged the Government to
estimate the cost of changes within six months.
Last night, committee chairman Mr Frank Field said: ''We are asking
for root and branch change in the current procedure.'' He pointed to the
report's central recommendation that the ''compensator and insurer bear
the cost of reimbursing the taxpayer for benefits paid'' to accident
victims as being much fairer to all.
Clydebank and Milngavie MP Tony Worthington, who led the campaign at
Westminster against the unit, said the Government must act now to claw
back benefit from ''those who cause accident, illness, and disease --
not from their victims''.
Glasgow-based lawyer Mr Frank Maguire, who represented Clydeside
Action at the select committee inquiry earlier this year, welcomed the
report and hoped the Government would act immediately 0

OIL companies being sued over the Cormorant Alpha disaster, in which
11 people died in 1992, could suffer injustice if damages actions are
allowed to proceed in the USA, a judge ruled yesterday.
Lord Abernethy confirmed an earlier ruling that the companies have
established an arguable case the proceedings should be heard in
Scotland.
At the Court of Session, he refused to lift an interdict which he
granted in March last year. The order bans the US courts from deciding
the merits of the case before a decision is reached on which country has
jurisdiction.
More than 50 relatives of those who died and surivors of the tragedy
are suing Shell, Esso, and Exxon. They want to pursue the actions in the
USA because they can expect to win much higher awards there than in
Scotland.
The actions follow the crash of a Bristow-owned Super Puma helicopter
shortly after take-off from Shell's Cormorant Alpha platform in
appalling weather conditions in March 1992. Six men, including the
pilot, survived.
There have been a number of lengthy, and sometimes acrimonious,
hearings in the Court of Session and in Texas in which the oil firms
have been accused of aggressive and intimidatory tactics.
Despite Lord Abernethy's interdict, a US judge has ruled an action in
the name of 53 relatives and survivors could go ahead in Brazoria
County, Texas.
Judge Neil Caldwell alleged the oil companies had undertaken a series
of deliberate, calculated manoeuvres to obstruct and impede the families
involved in the case.
This was denied by the companies, who have lodged an appeal against
Judge Caldwell's decision.
The families returned to the Court of Session last month, asking Lord
Abernethy to reconsider allowing the cases to go ahead in Texas.
In a written judgment issued yesterday, Lord Abernethy said that,
despite the complicated history of the action in the USA, including
Judge Caldwell's ruling, the preliminary issue of which legal system
should hear the case had not been exhausted.
No new information had been placed before him which significantly
strengthened the ''extreme fragility'' of the Texas connection with the
case. Nor was there any new information which significantly weakened his
view that the oil companies had an arguable case that Scotland was the
natural forum.
Lord Abernethy conceded that a guardian and temporary administrator
appointed in the US proceedings ''appear so far to have paid no regard
to the orders of this court'', but he was not convinced legal steps
taken in America rendered ineffective any order pronounced by him in
Scotland.
In his opinion, there was a risk of oppression or injustice to the
companies if the case were to be tried in Texas.
The families emphasised the great delay they would suffer if the
interdict were maintained and argued the order should be lifted to allow
the cases to be fought out in Texas.
Lord Abernethy said: ''I do not agree. No doubt maintaining the
interdicts will cause delay and to that extent prejudice the respondents
(the families). But that is a result of their having chosen to litigate
in Texas in circumstances in which the petitioners have made out a prima
facie case that the natural forum is not there but in Scotland.
''More important in my view, however, is that it was not suggested
that any prejudice to the families caused by delay will be
irrecoverable. On the other hand, if the action were allowed to proceed
to a conclusion in Texas it might well result in irrecoverable prejudice
to the petitioners.''
One of the difficulties for Lord Abernethy is that the families have
denied responsibility for what has happened in the US courts. At a
previous Court of Session hearing, they argued that court moves in the
USA were the responsibility of American court officers.

The handover from Hurd to Rifkind should be smooth, reports William
Russell
MALCOLM Rifkind is the man the Foreign Office fervently hoped would
succeed Douglas Hurd, and there was no concealing the feeling of relief
and pleasure at his appointment yesterday among those officials who will
have to work for him.
Not that he is quite so much One of Them as Douglas Hurd was, but he
is the kind of political boss diplomats understand. The handover should
be smooth.
He has been there before for a four year stint, starting in 1982 as an
Under Secretary, followed by promotion a year later to Minister of
State, the job he held until he entered the Cabinet as Scottish
Secretary in 1986. He impressed his Foreign Office officials, something
not all who have been Ministers there have succeeded in doing.
A laywer, he has the kind clinical mind diplomats enjoy dealing with.
A large part of the Foreign Secretary's job is examining options put to
him by officials and arguing the policy pros and cons. He can fight his
corner brilliantly, is nobody's pushover, and belongs to that tiny
select group of MPs who can speak without notes. This displays an
ability to master a brief, not the same thing as talking off the top of
his head, something he does not do.
Discretion is his second name. The battle of intellects between him
and Donald Dewar, who was his Scottish Office shadow, was formidable, a
sight to relish and what parliamentary debate ought to be all about. Not
for them the politics of the soundbite. He is notorious for being a
Minister who does not leak, would not know how to leak. Lunching
Malcolm, convivial thought it be, is a well known waste of time.
That he has inherited the job so smoothly shows how times have
changed. His family were Jewish emigrants from Lithuania, and that used
to be held out by the pundits as grounds for his not getting the job,
despite all his other virtues and qualifications.
He is a member of the Edinburgh Hebrew Congregation, and last year was
guest speaker when the Board of Deputies of British Jews met in Glasgow,
the first time the board, an elected body representing the Jewish
community in the United Kingdom, had met in Scotland in its 234-year
history.
In a world where Arabs play such a powerful role, and given the long
standing Arabist tradition in the Foreign Office, it may yet present
problems. The Middle East was not within his portfolio as a Foreign
Office Minister of State, but being Jewish has not proved a problem
during his time as Defence Secretary, a job he leaves after three years.
He has been to Arab countries several times.
The reality is he is as Scottish as the next man, an outstandingly
clever member of the Edinburgh legal elite.
He has an impressive clutch of Cabinet posts in his portfolio. After
the Scottish Office, one of the best training grounds there is, he went
to transport from 1990-92 and then defence. His time at transport was
none too happy, but at defence he cut the size of our armed forces by a
third without upsetting the chiefs of staff, or at least upsetting them
to the extent of resignations.
He may have had to cut, but he fought off the even larger cuts
demanded by the Treasury, and they were grateful.
A pro-European, he has of late been making more Euro-sceptical noises,
seen as a slightly crude and untypical attempt to pacify those on the
Euro-sceptic right opposed to his succeeding Douglas Hurd. The story had
gone round that John Major had virtually promised it to him.
It would be fair to describe him as a Euro-realist who is sceptical
about the single currency, a firm supporter of Nato, an opponent of any
kind of European army and a keen believer in the special relationship
with the United States.
He has already set out his stall on Europe -- insisting that the
''nation state'' reigns supreme and that federalism is an out-of-date
concept.
In a speech in Brussels earlier this year he claimed the federalist
ambitions of the fifties and sixties were dead. And those who claimed
the nation state was being left behind as the basis of government were
wrong.
He told the Belgian Institute of Foreign Affairs: ''The European Union
is entering a new and crucial stage of its development, and one with
which the peoples of Europe must be able to feel comfortable. The new
phase must combine expansion with adaptation; it must also mark a
decisive shift in the orientation of the union towards a more
outward-looking, less introspective stance in the world.''
He has had some rough times, particularly at the Scottish Office what
with Ravenscraig, the poll tax fiasco, continually rising unemployment,
that troublesome Michael Forsyth fellow, dissent within his own party,
and the SNP's insistence not to lie down and die.
He is pro-devolution, although he has performed a fairly skilful
balancing act on the issue so that he is committed to nothing too
specific. A traditional broad church Tory, he believes in consensus
rather than confrontation or ideological rectitude.
Aged 49, he was educated at George Watson's College and Edinburgh
University, from 1967-68 was a lecturer at the University College of
Rhodesia, was called to the Scottish bar in 1970, and became a QC in
1985. In 1970 he fought Edinburgh Central, and won Edinburgh Pentlands
at the 1974 election, the seat he still represents where his majority is
4290.
From 1975-76 he was Opposition spokesman on Scottish affairs, and in
1979 he got his first Government job as a junior Minister at the
Scottish Office responsible for Home Affairs and the Environment.
He is married with one son and a daughter and, like another famous
Edinburgh personage, is undeniably in his prime.

IAN LANG toured the Scottish Office in Whitehall late yesterday
morning, unaccompanied, to say goodbye to his staff. A few cried, Mr
Lang said how much he had enjoyed his stay, and. . . he was gone.
Those left to make sense of his four and half year tenure were
struggling to find any noteworthy trace of his time as Scottish
Secretary.
He directed the reorganisation of local government; he backed off
privatising Scotland's water; he put together Taking Stock, the
Government's meatless response to the pressures for constitutional
reform; and he managed to hang on to his seat in the 1992 election, a
feat that allowed him to gloat at the Tories' unexpected success in
increasing their seats in Scotland.
But the MPs and hangers-on at Westminster yesterday asked to assess Mr
Lang's impact at the Scottish Office found little to say. Urbane,
cautious, smooth-talking, the euphemisms for safe and boring were
trotted out with unsurprising regularity.
There are no memorable phrases, no explosive exchanges, no
barnstorming speeches in the Lang file. If all congratulated Mr Lang for
his unfailing courtesy, they also bemoaned his lack of fire.
Some might argue this is how a Cabinet Minister should be:
uncontroversial and loyal. And it is precisely these qualities, rare in
British politics, which have made Mr Lang one of a select group of the
Prime Minister's mosty trusted advisers.
Mr Lang was on hand when Mr Major announced the leadership contest, he
worked 18 hour days to manage Mr Major's campaign, and, with his
promotion to President of the Board of Trade, he has received his
reward.
The promotion was predicted, but the post wasn't. Mr Lang had been
tipped for Defence or the Foreign Office. Instead he takes over Michael
Heseltine's role as chief cheerleader for British industry.
He will be in charge of one of Whitehall's largest departments, with
its six Ministers and its remit to intervene ''before breakfast, before
lunch, before dinner'' to promote the interests of British business.
Ian Bruce Lang, 55 last week, is from an established Renfrewshire
family with extensive shipping interests. He was educated abroad --
Rugby and Cambridge -- which, he once said, explained his cut-crystal
English vowels.
At Cambridge he was involved with the Footlights of the John Cleese
generation. Later he ran a nightclub at the Edinburgh Festival that
became the Traverse Theatre, and wrote for That Was The Week That Was.
His showbiz credentials are often trotted out as proof of his humanity.
He entered politics after working in insurance. He contested Central
Ayrshire and Pollok before regaining Galloway from the SNP in 1979. Two
years later he was made a Whip. It was in the intense atmosphere of this
engine room of Government that he consolidated his relationship with
John Major.
It is an unlikely pairing -- a barely educated south Londoner with a
public school patrician -- but they have been close ever since, and Mr
Lang said last week: ''I trust him implicitly''.
In 1986 he became junior Minister at the Scottish Office, where he
survived the in-fighting of the Forsyth years. On November 28, 1990,
with John Major in Downing Street, he was made Scottish Secretary.
His task was to continue the management of Scotland's industrial
decline through the worst recession since the war, and to repair the
damage of Thatcher-Forsyth poll tax. Asked to defend an indefensible
wicket, he earned credit for his unflappability.
But his greatest political success was the 1992 election. Against the
predictions of every poll and pundit in the land, Mr Lang saw off the
Tory wipe-out expected in Scotland. Instead of losing seats, the Tories
gained two after a campaign in which Mr Major made defence of the Union
his centrepiece.
To show the Government had listened to the clamour for devolution, Mr
Lang produced Taking Stock, a series of measures designed to give
Scottish politicians a greater voice in the nation's affairs which were
rapidly dismissed as meaningless.
Mr Lang's majority in Galloway and Upper Nithsdale is 2468. As an
absentee Cabinet Minister, will he suffer the same fate as Chris Patten,
who lost his seat defending the Government? Those expecting the
flamboyance of the outgoing President of the Board of Trade will be
disappointed.
But as this reshuffle has shown, Mr Lang's promotion is about putting
a better face on the Government, an unthreatening, competent,
undoctrinaire face. And in that respect Mr Major has chosen wisely.
In November 1990 The Herald's System 3 poll put the Tories on 11%.
Yesterday, as Mr Lang set off for the Department of Trade and Industry,
System 3 found the Tories still on 11%. The safe pair of hands leaves
Scotland's Tories in the same state as he found them, facing an
uncertain future at the General Election.

THERE was widespread praise in Scottish Conservative circles for the
records of Ian Lang and Malcolm Rifkind which had won them promotion
within the Cabinet.
The president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association,
Mr David McLetchie, said: ''We now have three Scottish Tory MPs in the
Cabinet, as well as Lord Mackay as Lord Chancellor. Scotland's voice is
going to be clearly heard at the highest level, and I consider it a real
compliment to Scotland that we have produced men of this calibre.
''Ian Lang, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Forsyth are the flowers of
Scotland. Their achievement is one in which all Scots, regardless of
political persuasion, should take particular pride.''
Scots party chairman Sir Michael Hirst congratulated Mr Lang, saying:
''As the longest-service Scottish Office Minister, Ian has been an
inspirational force in Scottish politics. The rest of the UK will now
benefit from his great talents and I wish him every success.''
Mr McLetchie added: ''We are very grateful to Ian Lang for the leading
role he played in ensuring the Prime Minister's re-election as our
leader. Given this and his sure-footed handling of Scottish matters in
recent years, it was only a matter of time before he took up a UK
portfolio.
''The party in Scotland is indebted to him for his sterling work over
the last nine years. In particular, we will not forget his leadership at
the last General Election when he led the Scottish party to a victory
that will be long remembered.''  Meanwhile, the leader of the European
Parliament's socialist group, British Labour Euro-MP Pauline Green
complained last night that Mr Rifkind's appointment as Foreign Secretary
would ''cause dismay across Europe.''
She said: 'Mr Rifkind will not inspire confidence in Britain as a
European partner, and unless he gives clear signals of a changed
approach in the next few days it will be Britain that is the loser.''

MICHAEL Heseltine emerged from the Government ''reconstruction''
yesterday with immense new influence, just short of being Prime Minister
himself.
He is in charge of what Mr Major called ''ideas, priorities, and a
vision for the future of our country''.
Mr Heseltine, the man who brought down Mrs Margaret Thatcher and
remained loyal to Mr John Major, has been given maximum status as First
Secretary of State and Deputy Prime Minister -- titles last accorded to
Mr Rab Butler in 1962.
He will vet and project all other Cabinet Ministers' ideas and
legislation. His new job was negotiated with Mr Major, it emerged
yesterday, over several weeks.
The significance is simply stated. He and Mr Major spent
four-and-a-half hours together over the last two days. Mr Michael
Portillo, who becomes Defence Secretary, was accorded only eight
minutes.
It was touch-and-go yesterday in Downing Street whether Mr Ian Lang,
Mr Malcom Rifkind, or Mr Brian Mawhinney would become party chairman,
replacing Mr Jeremy Hanley who survives outside Cabinet as Foreign
Office Minister.
Mr Lang, one of the heroes of Mr Major's victory, chose to move from
the Scottish Office to replace Mr Heseltine at Trade and Industry. Mr
Rifkind takes the Foreign Office which involves almost constant travel,
which would not have suited Mr Lang, whose wife has a debilitating
illness.
As expected, Mr Michael Forsyth returns to Scotland as Secretary of
State. He is part of the Prime Minister's plan to instill ''new and
radical solutions to solve today's problems and grasp tomorrow's
promises''.
Mr Major is at pains to emphasise this is not an ordinary reshuffle of
his Government but a reconstruction.
He claims he is creating a Cabinet to balance all shades of Tory
opinion -- yet in the announcements of first and second rank Ministers
only one leading Euro-sceptic is rewarded.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor is promoted straight from the back benches to
Minister of State at the Foreign Office, bringing him into Government
for the first time in his 12 years at the Commons.
More junior posts are to be announced with the possibility of Mr
Raymond Robertson being brought in to Mr Forsyth's team instead of the
long-serving Sir Hector Monro.
The Prime Minister promised ''no recriminations'' after the leadership
fight but, apart from Sir Nicholas Bonsor, none of his critics have been
rewarded. Mr Major is not in a conciliatory mood, choosing not to accord
magnanimity to defeated rival Mr John Redwood.
He has also chosen to make a personal statement about former
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave, who figures largely in the
current Scott inquiry into the conduct of Ministers on arms to Iraq.
Mr Waldegrave is made Chief Secretary to the Treasury and number two
to Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, replacing Mr Jonathan Aitken who has
resigned.
In his resignation letter, Mr Aitken said he was standing down to
concentrate on impending libel actions against the Guardian and Granada
TV's World in Action.
However, Mr Major last night signalled his willingness to take back Mr
Aitken into the Cabinet if he can clear his name in the courts.
The first impact of Mr Heseltine's influence is the merger of
education and employment departments, a task given to Mrs Gillian
Shephard. Mrs Virginia Bottomley is relieved after six years at health
to be replaced by Mr Stephen Dorrel. She takes his job as Cabinet
Minister in charge of National Heritage.
Mr Mawhinney is the new party chairman but Mr Heseltine, working out
of the Cabinet Office, is in effect party chairman-in-chief.
His number two in Cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster will
be former Defence Minister Roger Freeman.
Sir George Young moves from the Treasury into Cabinet to become
Transport Secretary. Former Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg takes
over at agriculture and the Secretary of State for Wales is 34-year-old
Mr William Hague.
Other official resignations came yesterday from Mr Douglas Hurd as
Foreign Secretary and Mr Richard Ryder, who makes way for Mr Alastair
Goodlad as Chief Whip.
Former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Mr Major's propaganda
chief Mr David Hunt ''fell on his sword'' before he could be offered
another post.
Other key Ministers like Home Secretary Michael Howard remain in place
as a reward for their loyalty.

MR MICHAEL Forsyth last night marked his return to Scotland by
launching the most extensive consultation exercise ever attempted by a
Scottish Secretary.
Preaching compromise rather than confrontation, he promised to listen
to demands for more self-government, and vowed to fight for Scotland in
the Cabinet. He also asked people in all walks of life to meet him for
face-to-face talks.
However, his appointment provoked an immediate barrage of Opposition
criticism. Labour said Scotland had been sacrificed in the Tory
leadership trade-offs, and the SNP described him as the most unpopular
politician in Scotland.
Mr Forsyth, for his part, called for the personal attacks which
greeted the announcement of his appointment to stop. ''I'd like to see a
little less name calling from my political opponents and a bit more
constructive criticism, because that's what the people of Scotland
expect of their political leaders.''
Signalling a policy shift away from the hard-line Unionism of his
predecessor Ian Lang, Mr Forsyth set out his own definition of
devolution, with greater accountability for quangos and a fresh
examination of the role of local government. He conceded that the
''feeling'' of alienation that exists in Scotland needed to be
addressed.
But he also warned that the version of devolution proposed by the
opposition parties, with its ''tartan tax'' and extra layers of
politicians and bureaucrats, was unacceptable. ''All the advocates of
devolution say we have to have a parliament, more politicians, more
bureaucrats and a tartan tax.
''Why should people in Scotland have to pay an extra tax simply
because they work in Scotland?'' he said. Instead, devolution should be
about local democracy.
Despite his close association with its failure, he cited the poll tax
to attack Labour's plans on a Scottish parliament.
''I remember when we introduced the poll tax in Scotland ahead of
England, that all the opposition parties said it was outrageous that
Scotland should be paying a tax that the rest of the UK didn't have to
pay,'' he said. ''Here we have the same people now proposing as an act
of policy that Scotland uniquely should pay a tartan tax.''
Despite the Opposition attacks, he was fortified by the pledges of
allies and even former party enemies. They insisted he would show
maturity and diplomacy to unite the party in Scotland and balance the
combative, ideological style he would unleash on Opposition parties.
Already last night there were signs of his new broom at work,
involving two Scottish Office Ministers who are not from the right of
the party. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton is promoted to Minister of State
at St Andrew's House, replacing Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, who in turn
follows Mr Lang to the Department of Trade and Industry.
Mr Forsyth becomes the fourth Scot in the Cabinet -- joining Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, Foreign Secretary; Mr Ian Lang, Trade Secretary; and
Lord MacKay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor.
His first action yesterday was to draft a letter, to be posted to
representatives of all walks of Scottish life -- local authorities,
nurses, firefighters, farmers, teachers, business groups -- proposing
one-to-one private meetings to discuss ways of improving the
relationship between the Government and Scotland.
''I've said to them 'look, I take up this job, it's an enormous
responsibility, it's a tremendous honour. I want you to help me to do
the best job. Come in and talk to me privately about your ideas, your
concerns, and when I've completed that process then I think I'll be in a
better position to pronounce on what we should be doing','' he said.
The scope of the exercise suggests consultation on a significantly
greater scale than under the inconclusive Taking Stock policy launched
by Mr Major and Mr Lang following the 1992 General Election.
In a typically combative assertion of his willingness to put Scotland
first, Mr Forsyth said: ''I will certainly be Scotland's man in the
Cabinet rather than the Cabinet's man in Scotland. With the help and
support of the people of Scotland I think I can deliver.''
He had not lost his seat in Stirling at the last election, which he
holds by a majority of just 703, because he fought for the interests of
his constituents regardless of whether they voted for him or not. ''And
now as Scottish Secretary I plan to fight for Scotland, whether people
support me politically or not,'' he said.
He admitted the Tories were at a low-point in Scotland, which
threatens their survival north of the Border at the next election.
Commenting on yesterday's System 3 poll for The Herald, he said: ''We're
at 11% in the polls in Scotland. That's not a happy situation.''
An immediate sign of Mr Forsyth's new conciliatory approach could come
today if, as expected, he promotes to his new Scottish Office team
Aberdeen South MP Raymond Robertson, a fellow right winger with whom he
clashed during his turbulent spell as party chairman north of the Border
in the late 1980s.
But a key indication of the bitter aftermath of his previous spell at
the Scottish Office could also come if there is no place in his team for
Scottish agriculture and environment Minister Sir Hector Monro, who may
even spurn the opportunity to serve under him.
Sir Hector was guarded last night. ''I shall wait until I have been
asked and decide then,'' he said.
A further development today could give an enhanced role to Ayr right
wing MP Phil Gallie as a deputy to party chairman Sir Michael Hirst. It
is understood he will be asked to place his more abrasive style at the
service of the party as a media spokesman taking on Labour and the SNP.
He could have a tough time. The Scottish political air was thick with
the insults of political opponents yesterday, although on the
Conservative side there was the insistent sound of hatchets being buried
and olive branches proffered.
Tory moderate, Professor Ross Harper who was president of the party's
voluntary wing during the acrimonious time of Mr Forsyth's chairmanship
six years ago, said last night: ''Those who know him have come to
respect his wisdom, his maturity and his judgement.''
The civil servants nicknamed him Damian, after the Devil's offspring
in a horror film, and he never shirked from confrontation. This was
reflected in the reaction to his appointment by opponents.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said it showed Scotland had
been sacrificed in the Tory leadership trade-offs. ''To make Thatcher's
chief spear carrier the Scottish Secretary is a signal of just how
little we matter to John Major's wounded Government.''
He added: ''Poll Tax Forsyth's record on privatising the NHS started
the Tory slide in Scotland. The last time he was run out of Scotland by
the Tories. This time he will be run out by the people.''
STUC deputy general secretary Bill Speirs said it exemplified
Scotland's democratic deficit, and Mr Forsyth would be a living, daily
example of the need for a Scottish Parliament. They would, however,
recognise that they had to deal with him and would seek an early meeting
to discuss health, education, water and railways.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said hostility and dismay over the appointment
would bring the constitutional argument to the boil. ''How can a Prime
Minister who represents just 10% of the Scottish electorate and has been
rejected by a third of his MPs appoint the most unpopular politician in
Scotland to to the highest Scottish political office?''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said the appointment
underlined Tory desperation in Scotland, describing Mr Forsyth as the
former standard bearer for ''the very policies which pitted the Tory
administration against the views of the Scottish people''.
He conceded, however, that Mr Forsyth would enliven the Scottish
political scene and said the new Scottish Secretary had shown
''surprising receptiveness to well-reasoned argument.''
He added: ''For Scotland's sake, let's hope we have more of the
pragmatic Forsyth and none of the ideological zealot.''
This theme of a new, more mature and pragmatic Michael Forsyth was
much dwelt on within Scottish Conservative circles. His appointment was
immediately welcomed by Sir Michael Hirst, who called him ''one of the
best performers in Scottish politics.''
He added: ''I am absolutely confident that Scottish Tories will rally
behind Michael Forsyth and we will renew our attack against the policies
of Labour and the SNP.
''The party, Scottish central office and I will be working closely
with Michael and I look forward to increasing our support throughout
Scotland.''
Mr David McLetchie, president of the Scottish Conservative and
Unionist Association, said the appointment would galvanise Scottish
Tories.

A TEAM of detectives launched dawn raids in the Falkirk area yesterday
in an inquiry into alleged crime by councillors.
The squad of officers -- armed with warrants -- are believed to have
searched a number of homes and premises.
Last night, Central Scotland Police confirmed in a statement: ''A
number of premises within this police area were searched by officers .
''These searches are part of an investigation into alleged criminal
activities by councillors and other persons located within the Central
Scotland Police area.
''A report will be submitted to the procurator-fiscal in Falkirk
concerning the outcome of these investigations.''
The team of detectives is led by Superintendent Joe Holden. Last
night, he had set up an incident room at Falkirk Police HQ.
The police operation follows revelations earlier this year that a
Falkirk councillor was being investigated about an alleged #400,000
fraud.
In March, Falkirk procurator-fiscal George Scott confirmed: ''A
preliminary report is with me in connection with a Falkirk district
councillor.''
Mr Scott refused to comment further, other than that the investigation
was likely to take months to complete.
It is understood that another man -- not a councillor -- is also part
of the investigation, which involves an alleged mortgage and housing
benefit inquiry.
Falkirk District Council's chief executive, Walter Weir, refused to
comment last night on the latest shadow hanging over the local
authority.
Labour council leader Dennis Goldie said: ''I know nothing about this
at all.

A JOYRIDER who caused the death of a friend in a New Year car crash
was jailed for five years yesterday.
Robert Lamont, 25, was also banned from driving for 15 years for
showing a ''wanton disregard'' for the safety of others.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Lamont was said to be deeply
distressed over the death of his friend, Mr John Friel, and would have
it on his conscience for the rest of his life.
Mr Friel, 25, a passenger in a stolen Vauxhall Astra, died in
Glasgow's Western Infirmary on January 2 from injuries he suffered in
the crash.
The court was told that Lamont had been at a house in Clydebank
celebrating the New Year with friends. He left shortly after midnight
with the intention of stealing a car.
Lamont stole the G-registered Astra from Drumry Road, Clydebank, and
drove off with Mr Friel, Ms Michelle O'Neill, 18, and Mr Scott Kelly,
19.
He lost control of the car at the junction of Glasgow Road and Mill
Road before hitting metal barriers and a lamp standard.
Lamont was catapulted from the car for about 30yds and was found in a
state of shock. He has been left with some facial scarring.
Mr Friel, of Vanguard Street, Clydebank, sustained fatal injuries
while the other two passengers were injured.
When he appeared at Dumbarton Sheriff Court, Lamont was convicted of a
series of charges, including stealing the car, causing the death of Mr
Friel by driving dangerously, driving while unfit through drink or
drugs, failing to take a breath test, and dangerous driving.
Sheriff John Fitzsimmons decided that three years, the maximum
sentence he could pass, was not enough and sent him to the High Court
for sentence.
Mr Andrew Lamb, Advocate-depute, told the court yesterday that the
stolen car had been driven at an excessive speed on a stretch of dual
carriageway and passed, on the inside, a car that had stopped at traffic
lights.
Mr Lamb said it appeared that the car had been driven ''flat out''
before the driver lost control.
Mr Kevin Drummond QC, defence counsel, said: ''There was no apparent
reason why this accident happened. There was no obstacle in the road. It
was a straight road and there were no adverse conditions. The car
appears to have gone suddenly out of control with devastating
consequences.''
He added that at the time of the accident Lamont had been starting to
get his life into some sort of shape and had managed to find a job. But
he had taken drink at New Year and set off on an escapade that resulted
in tragedy.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, told the accused: ''I take a
serious view of this case and I consider that the sheriff was perfectly
correct to remit it to this court for sentence.''
Mr Friel's mother said later that her son had turned down an
invitation to a New Year party from Clydebank footballer Ken Eadie.
Instead, he accepted a lift from Lamont.
Mrs Mary Friel, who works as a caterer for Clydebank FC, said: ''If
only he had gone to Ken's party this would never have happened. It has
been an absolute waste of life.''
It was a second family tragedy for Mrs Friel, of Vanguard Street,
Clydebank, who lost her eldest daughter, Marie, in a crash near her home
several years ago.

<RECORDNO>977535248</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SOCIAL worker, alleged to have conducted a one-woman campaign
against the owner of an old folk's home, was so determined to bring the
place down she even fell out with a retired minister brought in to act
as a mediator, an appeal tribunal was told yesterday.
The residential home, owned by Dr Sohail Chaudhry, was closed down
amid claims of neglect last December.
A tribunal at Paisley Sheriff Court raised by Dr Chaudhry in a bid to
clear his name heard yesterday that social worker Mrs Davina Young
caused so much tension between herself and the Rev Bill Kenny that he
was advised to go on holiday to get away from the stress.
Dr Chaudhry said he had welcomed Mr Kenny to Caldwell House during its
final year in operation in the hope that the minister's wide experience
of caring for the elderly would help build bridges between himself and
Mrs Young.
Mr Kenny worked for nothing, taking residents on outings and arranging
sports and other recreational activities. Despite all that he had
achieved, Mrs Young was not impressed.
Dr Chaudrhy told the appeal against the cancellation of his
registration by Strathclyde Regional Council: ''The tension between the
Rev Kenny and Davina Young grew to such an extent that we thought it
better for him to go on holiday.''
He said said that, while the minister was on his break, Mrs Young had
suggested to him that, if Mr Kenny was to discontinue his relationship
with the home, they might be able to work towards a better relationship
themselves.
When the minister returned from holiday, Dr Chaudrhy told him it would
be better if he did not continue in his voluntary capacity.
As the tribunal sat for its third day, Dr Chaudhry claimed Mrs Young's
obstructive behaviour prior to the home opening in 1991 had been
damaging to its financial prospects.
She had insisted on a number of alterations being made to the layout,
despite knowing in advance of the proposed plans, and one one occasion
demanded that the lounge wallpaper had to be stripped and replaced as it
was not bright enough.
On three separate occasions, he was forced to make structural changes
-- one of which required the repositioning of two partitions, which only
needed to be moved inches to comply with Mrs Young's instructions.
He claimed that, during the entire three years and nine months the
home was open, he never received any referrals from the social work
department.
After the Community Care Act came into being and GPs were no longer
able to make referrals, numbers in his care began to dwindle further.
The tribunal continues.

Moscow, Wednesday
PRIME Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today ruled out any chance of
Moscow even discussing independence for Chechnya at peace talks in the
rebel region.
However President Boris Yeltsin, keen to end the Chechen crisis before
Russian parliamentary elections in December, gave the talks a boost by
promoting the head of Moscow's negotiations team to Nationalities
Minister.
Yeltsin, who sent in troops to the rebel region last December, has so
far shown little sign of softening his hard line.
Chernomyrdin, on the other hand, personally set up the peace
negotiations as part of a deal to solve a hostage crisis last month in
the southern Russian town of Budennovsk.
''The future status of Chechnya can be decided only on the basis of
the Russian constitution,'' Tass quoted Chernomyrdin as saying. The
constitution names Chechnya as one of Russia's regions and ethnic
republics.
Another agency, however, quoted Chernomyrdin as saying that Russia was
ready to offer wide economic autonomy to Chechnya of the kind granted
last year to the oil-rich region of Tatarstan.
Government talks with Chechen separatists were suspended on Monday
after rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev made clear he wanted a deal that
would recognise the region's independence.
The talks in the regional capital Grozny are due to restart tomorrow,
although each side accuses the other of violating a local ceasefire.
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met today after Russian negotiators had
apparently given the Prime Minister a hopeful progress report.
Chernomyrdin was reportedly optimistic about the talks, which have so
far produced a shaky truce and a tentative agreement on disengaging
federal troops and rebels.
The head of the Russian team, deputy Nationalities Minister Vyacheslav
Mikhailov, was promoted today to replace Nikolai Yegorov, whom Yeltsin
sacked last week in a shake-up of officials responsible for Russia's
campaign in Chechnya.--Reuter.

A SCHOOLBOY went on trial yesterday accused of a series of sex attacks
on the South Side of Glasgow. The 15-year-old, who cannot be named for
legal reasons, appeared in the dock of the High Court in the city
flanked by two policemen.
The youth, whose address was given as c/o a List D school, denies 15
charges, eight alleged to have happened on streets in the South Side on
July 2 and December 2 last year.
He is accused of seizing a woman and pulling her into a close in
Allison Street, Govanhill, where he threatened to kill her, threatened
to stab her with a knife, committed indecent acts, and raped her.
The charge further alleges he dragged her into the backcourt, raped
her again, pulled her over a wall, punched her repeatedly on the head,
and kicked her repeatedly on the head and body, all to her severe
injury.
The youth is also accused of assaulting four other women on the South
Side with intent to rape, and four charges of putting women in a state
of fear and alarm and committing a breach of the peace.
Further charges allege four sex offences against a girl of 15 in a
children's home, assaulting her, and assaulting a 14-year-old boy.
Defence counsel Mr Donald Findlay, QC, has lodged a special defence of
alibi in relation to the double rape charge.
The trial, before Lord McCluskey and a jury of 12 men and three women,
was adjourned until today without any witnesses being heard after a
request by the prosecutor, Mr Michael O'Grady.

Kiev, Wednesday
A MAN accused of killing a woman and skinning her corpse to make
clothes told a Ukrainian court he did it to calm his nerves.
The 21-year-old defendant pleaded guilty to asphyxiating his teenage
victim, identified only as Svetlana, with a clump of grass and making a
brassiere and shorts out of her skin the following day, a Ukrainian
newspaper reported.
The trial that began this week in the western Ukrainian province of
Khmelnytsky shocked residents with its grisly details. The defendant was
not identified in the report by the Kievskiye Vedomosti newspaper.
Police found dog skins and a blanket made from mouse skins in the
man's home, which he shared with his parents and sister in the small
town of Letichev, the newspaper said.
Neighbours told reporters the family had a reputation for being odd,
and that the accused was a keen collector of women's lingerie.
The defendant killed his victim as she was returning home from a disco
on May 9. In addition to skinning her corpse, he cut off her head,
gouged out her eyes, and chopped off some of her extremities in a manner
police said was ''very professional''.
Authorities were alerted to the crime after a group of children
discovered pieces of skin in a bag in the forest. Police eventually
found the rest of the body hidden in a nearby cemetery.--AP.

AN animal rights group is spitting mad at a plan by Glasgow District
Council to stage camel races on Glasgow Green.
The races are intended to form part of the annual Glasgow Show on July
22 and 23, which will have a medieval theme and include jousters, a
circus, and, curiously, a Radio 1 Roadshow.
However, the bid to launch the ships of the desert has angered Animal
Concern. The group's organising secretary, Mr John Robins, said last
night: ''If the council is concerned about public safety it should scrap
these camel races right now.
''Our main worry is for the welfare of the camels, but it must be
recognised that these are powerful, dangerous, wild animals which are
known to be unpredictable.
''Instead of allowing a cheap publicity stunt which exploits animals
and could put the public at risk, the council should recognise animals
have rights and a modern progressive city would protect those rights
instead of ignoring them.''
Animal Concern said it had written to the council asking it to ban the
races and warning that, if necessary, a boycott would be organised.
The letter reads: ''Although the 1995 show is to have a medieval
theme, we regret it has been decided to revert to the medieval practice
of exploiting exotic animals for people to gawk at. Such menageries have
no place in modern society and, unless Glasgow is struck by
desertification, camels have no relevant place in the Glasgow Show.''
A council spokesman said last night: ''We recognise the concerns
raised but feel that all of them have been considered at the outset.''
He said there would be no danger to the public because the animals
would be secure behind barriers in an arena.
He added: ''All animal events are carried out under veterinary
scrutiny. These animals are licensed by the Test Valley Borough Council
in England under the Dangerous Animals Act. This means that they are
checked by local authorities.''

Margaret Vaughan explains why there are winners and losers in a new
scheme to help the low-paid
THERE is a neat if unintended irony, surely, in dumping the Department
of Employment on the same day as you announce a new scheme to top up the
pay of people in employment who are working for rock-bottom wages.
It is only a pilot project, granted. But if, like Sharon, you earn
#1.18 an hour titivating hair the prospect of an extra #19 a week on the
wage slip is not to be sniffed at. It is the difference between staying
at home with the family and leading an independent life, she thinks.
She hasn't a clue, and couldn't care less, whether the announcement of
the pilot project to test out a new income-related benefit is, as
billed, a radical departure aimed at developing a national scheme. All
that matters for her is that, suddenly, she doesn't feel such a numpty
for working. Her friends who left school, like her, with few
qualifications have been picking up as much in benefit as she has earned
for working a 47-hour week in an Edinburgh hairdressing salon.
''Still, I may be a skivvy but at least I'm being trained,'' she says.
Shame, then, that she won't qualify for the pilot project top-up. In the
Government's green paper, published yesterday, the eight pilot and four
control areas likely to be selected for the experiment in bumping up low
wages did not include Edinburgh.
Lanarkshire, Dumbarton, Stirling, Perth, and Crieff, along with
Falkirk, Alloa, Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy, and North East Fife are to be
the testing grounds for what is billed as a new approach to in-work
benefits.
Roger Evans, the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Security (at least
he was when details of the scheme were published in the late afternoon)
set out the detailed proposals to pilot test the new scheme. The benefit
is to be targeted at those without children, will include some 20,000
people, and run over a three-year period, beginning next year.
It is, he explained, designed to make work ''more rewarding'' for
those with limited earnings power, by enhancing their earnings. That
means the untrained, unskilled will get a financial leg-up to persuade
them into work. It will complement Family Credit, which already tops up
the low earnings of 600,000 workers.
According to the Department of Social Security, the earnings top-up
will raise income by an average of around #23 a week for a couple with
no children, and about #19 for a single person of 25 or over. There are
to be two different rates tested in the pilot areas.
Evans says this is the first time a Social Security benefit has been
tested on a pilot basis before it is introduced nationally: ''The
Government believes that a major departure such as the wider extension
of in-work benefit help -- for which there is no experience anywhere in
the world -- ought to be tried out on a local basis.''
The aim, says the publicity material, is to test its effectiveness and
identify any wider impact on the economy before deciding whether it
should be extended. Which means officials will be assessing whether it
distorts the labour market and how much it will cost the Treasury before
deciding whether it should be extended.
The idea seems to be that you can transform the Social Security system
by topping up the wages of those who find a job, however low-paid,
instead of paying them to stay out of work. Seems sensible enough. There
is though, says the Low Pay Unit, another way to induce people to work.
It is to ensure an economy which offers jobs and to pay a liveable wage
rather than rely on state top ups: ''Of course this is a subsidy for bad
employers. As usual, we'll get employers ringing us up to find out how
low their wages can be so that people on benefit don't lose their state
money if they work for them,'' says the LPU's Bharti Patel.
It has been claimed that the green paper pre-empts Opposition plans to
help people out of the poverty trap. According to Patel, means-tested
benefits create a crazy system where 70% of benefit is clawed back from
every pound earned above benefit levels.
The proposals, and crucially the outcome of the pilot, will intensify
the arguments over whether a minimum wage is needed. Irony, again
intrudes into the argument. For what, effectively, the Tory's pilot
scheme involves is topping up low wages from taxpayers' money. What
Labour aims to ensure is that employers offer wages with a ceiling below
which employees' wages should not fall.

<HEADLINE>Campaigner calls for work at Dounreay to be halted. Radiation found at roadside</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977535254</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FRESH evidence of radioactive contamination at Dounreay was conceded
yesterday by the UK Atomic Energy Authority.
The authority admitted that 20 radioactive particles have been removed
from roadside verges at the Caithness site over the past month.
Dounreay management said there was only a very low risk of any worker
having come in contact with potentially harmful hot spots, as the
material was embedded in the soil.
However, anti-nuclear campaigner Mrs Lorraine Mann has called for an
immediate suspension of activities at Dounreay until the latest example
of contamination is cleaned up.
As new checks get under way today to establish if there is more
extensive contamination, Mrs Mann, who represents Scotland Against
Nuclear Dumping, believes it would be wise to stop operations until the
problem is resolved.
She says that the particles could have been lethal, although she
accepts the risk of anyone coming into contact with them is small.
Mrs Mann claims the latest find, which follows the ongoing discovery
of similar hot spots on the Dounreay foreshore, is further damning
evidence of sloppy working practices at Dounreay.
''I think this is absolutely appalling,'' she said. ''It's hard to
find the words that haven't already been used to condemn what has been
allowed to go on at Dounreay.''
Mrs Mann is concerned there is widespread contamination of land on the
site of the experimental nuclear plant.
She also believes there is the potential for particles to be carried
off site by birds or vermin.
She said: ''Until they've clear up this contamination, they must stop
operations at the site.''
A 15-strong task force, including specialists from other nuclear
sites, will today attempt to establish whether there is more widespread
contamination.
Managers and union representatives have been informed about the latest
find, and a workers' hot-line has been set up.
Site manager Mr John Baxter says the metallic particles are similar to
those which have regularly been detected on the adjoining foreshore.
He accepts that, if swallowed or held close to the skin for a long
time, they could cause health problems, but he believes it is crucial
that no loose material has been uncovered.
Mr Baxter believes the problems could date back to the 1960s or early
1970s involving material being spilled as it was being taken for
disposal at the now-disused waste shaft at the plant.
''When particles were carried from the fuel cycle area by a trailer
inside a flask to the shaft, it may be that some of them were dropped as
they were transported,'' he commented.
Mr Baxter agrees that the find has shown up a shortcoming in the
UKAEA's radioactive monitoring programme. It is a matter of concern, he
said, that they had been undetected for 30 or so years.
''That is one of the questions I'll be addressing.
''We have a comprehensive monitoring programme, but nevertheless there
appears to be a number of areas such as the verges where the monitoring
has not been comprehensive enough.''
Mr Baxter denies that the discovery is further evidence of his being
in charge of a dirty site.
He said the ground survey is part of the ongoing multi-million
decommissioning programme of the site.
He said: ''We've a number of environmental problems on the site, which
we're addressing and actively tackling. That is not a justification for
us stopping our current activities, nor pursuing new work.''
In addition to the hot-spots, the latest survey found ''light or
moderate'' levels of contamination within the fuel cycle area and around
the old Dounreay fast reactor. Some of this land has been cordoned off.
Two further less contaminated sites around drain duct covers were
identified and cleaned up.
The finds have been notified to the nuclear regulatory authorities and
will be of interest to the Government committees which have been
investigating the foreshore contamination.

Forty-seven years after the setting up of the National Health Service
it is still the sacred cow of British politics. John Campbell describes
the brilliance of the man who delivered it
BATTERED, commercialised and threatened as it is, the National Health
Service survives as the one enduring monument of British socialism.
Even as she gleefully dismantled the rusting superstructure of
Attlee's economic collectivism, Margaret Thatcher dared not tackle the
NHS head-on but, on the contrary, felt obliged repeatedly to promise
that it was ''safe'' in Tory hands; only towards the end of her reign
did she initiate a programme of internal reform which radically
overhauled its mechanisms while leaving the central concept
substantially intact.
To the chagrin of the Tory right, the NHS remains to this day the
sacred cow of British politics. In its long retreat from socialism
during the past 40 years, Labour has clung to the NHS as the embodiment
and symbol of the superiority of its deepest values. It is indelibly
associated with the talismanic memory of its creator, Nye Bevan, the one
authentic socialist hero the British Labour movement has produced.
Yet, paradoxically, the success and lasting popularity of the NHS
derived from the little-noticed fact that it was not strictly socialist
at all, but a brilliant diversionary fudge.
There can be no doubt that some form of health service would have come
into being after 1945 whichever party had won the General Election. It
was a central assumption of the Beveridge Report that such a service
would be established alongside the comprehensive social security system
which he proposed; and it was not one which the Conservatives were
disposed to challenge.
The Conservative Minister of Health under the Coalition Govermment,
Henry Willink, had already produced a White Paper in 1944 which
envisaged a system of free medical treatment for all, based on the
extension of existing insurance arrangements. The caretaker Conservative
Government had a Bill prepared.
Labour policy, influenced by the left-wing Socialist Medical
Association, was much more radical and more ambitious; the 1945
manifesto officially committed the party to creating a single, unified
system based on local authority-run hospitals and health centres to be
staffed by full-time, salaried doctors.
But Bevan, taking office in 1945, threw this out of the window. Given
the need to produce a Bill quickly, building on the groundwork of the
past four years, he was effectively committed by the concessions Willink
had made to the BMA. A salaried state medical service was a political
non-starter. Instead Bevan concentrated his radicalism on the problem of
the hospitals.
The pre-war hospital system was a chaotic patchwork of overlapping
rivals; on the one hand the municipal hospitals (often old Poor Law
institutions) run by the local authorities, on the other the voluntary
hospitals supported by private endowments and local charity.
Bevan's bold initiative was to scrap both and nationalise the
hospitals, both municipal and voluntary, under the Ministry of Health.
This upset Labour local authorities and Conservative Lady Bountifuls
equally, but it pleased the hospital doctors, whose great fear was of
being put under the local authorities, and ensured their willingness to
participate in a universal service.
This was Bevan's crucial decision. In time, he was to be criticised by
the left, first for dividing the hospitals from other services while
leaving the GPs essentially untouched, missing the chance to create a
unified system; and second for buying the support of the Royal Colleges
by allowing the consultants to retain the right to private practice.
''I stuffed their mouths with gold,'' he later admitted. But he was
persuaded that he must induce the top doctors to join the NHS if it was
to be more than a safety net for the poor.
If he was to have a universal service -- making the best available to
all -- he needed the consultants at least partly inside it. If he could
only achieve this by allowing them to retain private practice as well,
he would live with that; he believed that the superiority of the NHS
would quickly ensure that private practice withered away. By rejecting
the ''pure'' socialist model Bevan believed that he had secured the
substance of a national service rather than the theory.
The BMA's strident campaign against Bevan's NHS was spurious shadow
boxing; at the end of a year's negotiations, threats and ballots they
claimed to have secured all sorts of safeguards against a bogey --
salaried doctors directly employed by the State -- which Bevan never
proposed.
In the end they not only joined but tried to take the credit for the
service -- which paradoxically they were entitled to do, since its
ultimate shape was determined more than anything else by the BMA's
refusal to accept the local authority hospital/health centre model.
All the most fundamental criticisms of the structure of the NHS as set
up in 1948, which every subsequent reorganisation has been aimed at
remedying, come back to the decision not to base the service on the
local authorities. The various medical services were fragmented instead
of unified, and the gulf between GPs and hospitals widened instead of
closed; there was inadequate financial discipline, and no democratic
control below the power ultimately vested in the Minister of Health.
In retrospect, the case for the local authorities can look formidable,
the decision to dispossess them a fateful mistake by a minister
ideologically disposed to centralisation and seduced by professional
special pleading.
But the fact is, that the local authority option was not a practical
possibility in 1945. On the one hand the local authorities themselves
were in a chaotic patchwork in need of reform; on the other the skirmish
Bevan had with the BMA was nothing to the battle he would have had with
both the GPs and the consultants had he tried to impose a socialist
service.
It stands to the credit of his political realism than he did not try.
He chose instead to make a virtue of his relative impotence by stressing
the value of what he could deliver, which was a lot; a comprehensive,
universal and above all, free service which, for all its faults, became
a source of pride to all parties for the next 40 years, delivering a
high level of care at internationally low cost.
Bevan's historic achievement, which no amount of subsequent criticism
can take away from him, is that he was the minister who set the service
up; it was not his creation, but after years of talk it fell to him --
thanks to Attlee's remarkable boldness in giving him the job -- to take
the key decisions, draft and carry the Bill through Parliament, create
the machinery and appoint all the necessary boards and committees to
administer it.
This, as an untried minister with a reputation as a left-wing
firebrand, he did with extraordinary efficiency and flair. He delivered
the new service to a grateful nation.
His secondary achievement was to contrive the appearance of a
political triumph for Labour when in fact he had enacted virtually none
of the party's cherished prescriptions. ''His outstanding success,'' one
of his critics noted, ''was to apply the anaesthetic to supporters of
his own side, making them believe in things they had opposed almost all
their lives.''
To do this he needed the public row with the BMA. Bevan was much
criticised for his abrasive handling of the BMA; but nothing he could
have said or done would have appeased them. It suited Bevan that they
made a fuss; his supporters would have been a great deal more restive if
they had not, and his glory as the architect of Labour's crowning
monument would have been much less if the Tories had not been
wrongfooted into opposing it.
Bevan was determined to extract all the party capital he could from
the Tories' opposition. When Attlee proposed to make a statesmanlike
broadcast describing the NHS as a national achievement to which all
parties had contributed, Bevan protested: ''The Conservatives voted
against the National Health Act not only on the second but on the third
reading,'' he wrote. ''I do not see why we should forget this.''
The evening before the service came into operation he deliberately
punctured Attlee's atmosphere of mutual congratulation by making his
notorious speech describing the Tories as ''lower than vermin''. Bevan
welcomed the BMA's help in making the NHS appear a more socialist
measure than it really was.
Bevan's creation of the National Health Service defied his reputation
as a left-wing fundamentalist, revealing instead the other side of his
character as a practical constructive politician.
As the Cabinet Minister responsible for both health and housing, he
was far more doctrinaire with regard to housing, where he insisted on
favouring public over private house building, at the cost of delaying
the number of houses built. But he had never subscribed to the Socialist
Medical Association model of health provision. His idea of socialised
medicine concentrated on extending to the whole nation the two essential
principles offered its members by the Tredegar Medical Aid Society in
his youth; universal access and free treatment.
To preserve the principle of free treatment he was prepared to resign
from the Government in 1951. But how the treatment was delivered he
regarded as a matter of administration. In 1948 he secured what he
wanted from a national health service; the British public shared his
priorities then, and they have never ceased to bless him for it since.
* John Campbell's biography of Nye Bevan was reissued by Hodder &amp;
Stoughton in 1994.

Ian Bruce underlines the difficulties facing the Rapid Reaction Force
in a Bosnia operation doomed to failure
AMERICAN Galaxy transport aircraft will today begin delivering the
first elements of Britain's last-gasp attempt to salvage the lost cause
of peacekeeping in Bosnia.
Despite Croat meddling and Serb threats, up to 4000 fighting men from
24 Airmobile Brigade will be in place by the end of the month to help
extricate their comrades trapped deep in the Bosnian hinterland before
winter shuts down both military and diplomatic options.
Their remit is unclear. Once deposited on former Yugoslavian soil,
they will come under control of the United Nations. It is a chain of
command bedevilled by distance and lack of perspective. New York is a
long way from downtown Sarajevo and a universe removed from reality on
sniper alley.
The UK has already scaled down its original commitment to sending in
an extra 6500 men as part of an Anglo-French-Dutch rapid reaction force
designed to ride shotgun on aid convoys and protect its lightly-armed
peacekeeping brethren operating in-country.
In classic Gallic style, the French have sent in 2000 soldiers from
the Foreign Legion as the advance-guard of its rapid-deployment brigade.
The French have always been committed to fighting to the last drop of
someone else's blood in the cause of international solidarity.
They have also threatened to use their troops to punch a route through
to the besieged Bosnian capital. It is a move tantamount to declaring
war on the Bosnian Serbs, and, by definition and law of Balkan
blood-feud, on Serbia proper.
Rhetoric aside, any armoured thrust to clear the way to Sarajevo would
mean heavy casualties and the embroilment of Nato countries in a
never-ending conflict in the cockpit of Europe.
The UN approach has been a failure. Vacillation and inconsistency in
policy have allowed the Serbs to call the shots militarily and
psychologically. Despite the presence of 23,000 peacekeepers, 200,000
people have died in 38 months. The death toll includes 172 Blue Helmet
soldiers so far.
A handful of Serb nationalist leaders skulking in the mountain village
of Pale have dictated the course of events on the world stage. They have
exploited UN weakness and Nato belligerence to set their own agenda for
Greater Serbia.
It is the equivalent of Screaming Lord Sutch controlling policy for
the European Union from a holiday hideaway in Plockton.
The concept of a Rapid Reaction Force has some merit if effective and
impartial military force has to be applied. Under UN command, such a
unit can achieve little more than increasing the number of potential
hostages and peripheral victims.
There is a growing awareness that the fate of the peacekeepers
scattered across hundreds of square miles of remote mountain terrain
cannot be left to UN inconsistency. French and British troops
predominate. Concern for their welfare cannot be left to a committee in
New York.
There is a consensus between London and Paris on that basic point.
There is consensus on little else. Everyone is marching to a different
drum.
The United States, usually naive in the complexities of international
affairs, has stayed well clear of what could become another Vietnam.
Former Yugoslavia is a jungle in every sense but the tropical.
German commitment of Tornado combat aircraft as a gesture towards
international responsibility has served only to muddy the waters.
Germany supported the Croats during the Second World War. More than
700,000 Serbs and Muslims died at the hands of the Croat Ustashe and
their descendants have long memories and sharp knives.
The Serbs are past-masters at exploiting gaps in their opponents'
ranks. They have played a long game against the UN for more than three
years, pushing brinkmanship to new levels.
UN surrender of heavy weapon stores around Sarajevo last month, and
the vetoing of Nato air strikes in retaliation for Serb aggression, has
weakened the Security Council's hand beyond redemption.
The Serbs now regularly target aid convoys grinding in over the single
''open'' road to starving Sarajevo. It has become a duck-shoot on a
logging trail. Even the French have been careful to fire only warning
shots against their attackers.
The UK has more than 3500 troops in Bosnia. Another 1000 equipped with
artillery and mine-clearing equipment are on standby in neighbouring
Croatia, with 4000 more due to arrive within the next two weeks.
A UN planning group based in the Croatian capital of Zagreb hopes to
announce final details of their mission and rules of engagement within
the next month. Most of the senior military commanders involved regard
that as a farce.
Internal rows over command between the British and French already
there has ensured that no coherent unified control can be exercised in
the future. Men are being committed piecemeal to an operation which has
failed before it gets off the ground.
The range of missions available to any rapid reaction force would be
limited by terrain, weather and transport under ideal conditions. It
could provide a shield of firepower and a retaliatory threat if the will
to enforce the UN's aid mandate existed.
It could be the latter-day 7th Cavalry riding to the rescue of
besieged enclaves. But that would exceed current UN rules. It would,
despite the commitment of up to 100 transport and attack helicopters,
inevitably be hemmed in by cloud and mountains.
Its real role is a covering umbrella for the pullout of UN troops. It
is a role which can be achieved only in good weather. Despite hi-tech
weaponry and the proximity of Nato airfields in Italy a short flight
across the Adriatic, pilots cannot hit what they cannot see. Effective
air cover remains seasonal.
Bosnia should be a watershed for both the UN and Europe. It is the
EU's backyard war, and as such, cannot be ignored. It is Europe's
problem on both humanitarian and refugee levels. There is also the
threat of conflict spilling over to engulf Greece, Turkey and other
potential belligerents.
But it is also time for the UN to accept the limited parameters of its
own ability to control conflict or put a brake on suffering. The UN must
either establish an effective military command on the ground, widen its
remit to allow carefully escalated retaliation, or throw in its hand.
Serbs, Croats, and Muslims will continue to kill each other in spite
of the UN presence. Apart from civilians caught in the triple crossfire,
the only other losers in the short-term are likely to be British and
French soldiers whose mission had failed before it began.

VICTORIA Quay, the new #47m Scottish Office building in Leith which
has aroused criticism over its furnishings and facilities which include
a #539,000 swimming pool, should be functioning with its staff of around
1500 by the end of October.
Fitting out the building has cost #14m which, it is said, will save
the taxpayer more than #3m per year because of rental reductions and its
energy efficiency scheme. Yesterday, it opened its doors to the media.
As well as the swimming pool and other fitness areas, there is a
200-seat restaurant and a nursery for 35 children.
Scottish Office sources defended the inclusion of the 25m x 10m
swimming pool, saying the running costs would be met by annual
membership charges of around #75.
A survey has indicated that around one third of staff are expected to
use the leisure facilities.
Management was advised by health officials that a swimming pool would
be beneficial and maintains that if the pool -- which was an integral
part of the design when the building was commissioned -- had not been
there, money would have had to be spent on the space, including walls
and landscaping.
There has also been criticism of the fixtures and fittings, including
a #36,000 reception desk and commissioned art works costing thousands of
pounds.

Geneva, Wednesday
UNITED NATIONS Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and France's
President Jacques Chirac pledged today to press on with diplomatic
efforts to end the three-year conflict in Bosnia.
Chirac told reporters in Geneva that he had urged new European Union
mediator Carl Bildt to ''talk to all parties on the ground'', including
the increasingly isolated Bosnian Serb leadership in their headquarters
at Pale.
''What is important is to continue the diplomatic negotiations,''
Boutros-Ghali told a news conference. He said he would meet his top
aides for ex-Yugoslavia on Saturday to review the peace process.
Chirac, in a speech at ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the
UN, said France also favoured continuing the search for ''a balanced and
negotiated settlement'' through newly-appointed European Union mediator
Carl Bildt.
At a news conference later, he said he had told Bildt that ''we should
talk with all parties on the ground, without making judgement on which
side bears responsibility even if we have our convictions on that
score''.
If the major powers and the UN wanted peace, the French president
declared, ''we need to negotiate with everyone, even with the Serbs of
Pale''.
Boutros-Ghali told an earlier news conference that he would do
everything he could to ensure that the beleaguered UN Protection Force
remained in the ex-Yugoslav republic.
He said: ''I believe that a pull-out would aggravate the situation and
make more difficult not only our diplomatic efforts, but also our
humanitarian operations''.
Despite their emphasis on negotiations, both leaders made clear that
they saw the new multi-national Rapid Reaction Force as a vital element
in the equation.
Presence of the some 10,000-strong Franco-British-Dutch force under
overall UN command in Bosnia would ease the role of Unprofor in the
region, said Boutros-Ghali.
Chirac made clear he did not envisage use of the reaction force to
punch a road through Bosnian Serb-held territory to bring aid to
Sarajevo.
This view was supported by UN officials in Zagreb and Sarajevo who
indicated that the first use of the force now deploying in central
Bosnia was still weeks away.
However French armed force chief Admiral Jacques Lanxade said the
force could be in action within days.
''If nothing has moved in the next few days regarding access to
Sarajevo, we will clearly have to take action to restore a more normal
life for Sarajevo residents,'' he said.
French UN troops, ignoring Bosnian Serb threats, began driving lorries
at night over the treacherous Mount Igman route to Sarajevo four days
ago, and came under attack from the Serb forces laying siege to the
Bosnian capital.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council today renewed until mid-September
the easing of some sanctions on the rump Yugoslavia, but stringent trade
bans stay intact because of the republic's support for the Bosnian
Serbs.
The curbs on travel, cultural, and sporting ties were relaxed last
October in return for a pledge by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
to allow international monitoring of the Yugoslav-Bosnian
border.--Reuter.

A DIVING support vessel with 66 on board was holed last night in a
collision with a gas platform in the North Sea.
On board the ship, the Ocean Stephan Iturn, are 12 divers who were
inside a small decompression chamber when the collision happened.
The divers cannot be released from the chamber until they have been
fully decompressed. They have been transferred to a pressurised life
boat on the ship as a precaution.
The rig involved is the Shell Inde Kilo, about 60 miles east of
Cromer, Norfolk.
Shell said last night the rig support ship was sailing towards South
Shields, escorted by Cromer lifeboat, and rescue services were on full
alert.
Shell said the platform suffered only superficial damage.
A spokesman for the company said: ''Inadvertant contact between the
two vessels occured at around 2100 hours when the support vessel was
manoeuvring to commence work on the platform.
''The coastguard has described the incident as minor. There is
superficial damage to the platform. The diving support vessel suffered
damage involving a small hole above the water line.
''A small quantity of fuel has escaped from a fuel tank. The tank has
been pumped dry. The divers are in a pressurised life raft and the
support vessel is making its own way to South Shields.''

TWO groups of protesters held counter-demonstrations outside
Motherwell District Council's headquarters yesterday over opencast plans
for the Lanarkshire village of Morningside.
Members of the Morningside Opencast Action Group held a silent vigil
outside the council buildings while councillors ratified the planning
committee's recommendation that the proposals be passed.
However, the council announced that its own experts would examine soil
samples after claims by the action group that the ground was
contaminated and posed a health risk to children at the nearby school.
After the meeting, a spokesman for the action group, Mr Allan Brown, a
university lecturer, said the group planned to take legal action to
force the council to order the applicants, Hydrachrome Ltd, to carry out
an environmental impact assessment.
Mr Brown said: ''The primary school is very close to the opencast
site, and if the ground is disturbed, these dangerous toxins would be
exposed.''
The application, by Hydrachrome Ltd, which already manufactures hard
chrome plating, is in two phases. The first involves the opencast
removal and ground stabilisation of 3.3 acres so that the company can
build a larger factory than the building currently standing there.
The second phase involves the extraction of 35,000 tonnes of material
over a three-year period to prepare the ground for building 100 houses.
Councillor David McKendrick, who represents the Newmains area, said
unemployed people had held a counter-demonstration because they wanted
the work that would be generated by both the enlarged factory and the
housing development.
Hydrachrome's managing director Mr William Hill predicted the factory
would increase the current workforce in his Morningside factory from 10
to more than 30. Phase two would create 100 jobs, he claimed.

A REPORT designed to persuade the Government to reconsider its
decision to close Aberdeen's Torry Food Science Laboratory (FSLT) will
today be on the desk of Agriculture and Food Secretary Douglas Hogg.
The 50-page report, compiled by a task force set up by the Aberdeen
Research Consortium, is understood to recommend that the skills and
resources of the laboratory are retained in Aberdeen, but dispersed
between the Marine Laboratory, the Rowett Research Institute and the
University of Aberdeen.
Professor Hugh Pennington, of Aberdeen University's Department of
Microbiology, who headed the task force, said yesterday they were very
pleased with the report, which was handed in by North-east MPs Raymond
Robertson, Bob Hughes and Malcolm Bruce.
He said they believed they had established an ''unassailable''
scientific case for the retention of the FSLT within Aberdeen, and they
had also been able to put forward very strong economic arguments.
The report includes a number of highly technical arguments, and no
details are being made public at this stage because of ''the
sensitivities associated with the future employment of FSLT staff, the
necessarily commercial nature of parts of the report and the possible
misinterpretation of the complex scientific detail''.
Speculation about the future of the 65-year-old research station and
its 100 staff ended on June 6 when it was announced that it would be
closed and 80 jobs would be transferred to a new ''super-lab'' in York.
The remaining jobs would switch to the Torry Marine Laboratory.
However, the announcement met with tremendous opposition throughout
the area and an immediate campaign to save the laboratory was launched.
A 21,000 signature petition has already been handed in to Parliament.
Following representations from the local MPs, the then Agriculture and
Food Secretary William Waldegrave conceded the granting of a 30-day
period of grace to enable the Aberdeen Research Consortium, of which the
FSLT is a member, to evaluate prospects for the alternative distribution
of its research functions to other institutions within the area.
Professor Pennington said he believed they had now put forward a very
strong case for retention of the facilities within the city, and that if
the laboratory did close it would be a major jobs blow and in terms of
the science and the food industry within Aberdeen.
He said that they had been given a very short time to establish their
arguments and hoped the Government would respond with similar speed.

JOHN Major, by putting his leadership on the line, has given his
Government its last chance for a fresh start.
Having failed time after time in the last couple of years to draw a
line in the sand only to be undermined by some further misadventures, he
raised the stakes to the limit.
His victory and immediate wholesale reconstruction of the Government
is sufficiently dramatic to make July 4-5 the time from which this last
attempt of his apparently doomed Government to turn the political tide
can be dated.
The problems within the party will not go away, and if they break out
again with anything approaching the savagery of the last fortnight
probably nothing can save the Tories.
The voters do not like divided parties. Disenchanted as they already
are, they will be hard to woo back.
Despite the front-line role given to Michael Heseltine, who has made
the supreme sacrifice of giving up being a President to become a mere
Chancellor of the Duchy, it is the other Chancellor on whom the
Government's hopes most depend.
To put it bluntly, Kenneth Clarke must cut taxes significantly in
November and the following November -- if the Government is spared that
long -- pretty well regardless of what the economic circumstances may
be.
This November in particular, he has to do it without producing results
over the next 12 months that will make a nonsense of his earlier claims
to have acted prudently. This will not be easy to pull off.
Mr Major has made the consistently low rates of inflation the
Government has been obtaining the keystone of his whole economic policy.
He is fond of saying that never in recent times has inflation been
''under more secure lock and key.''
If that ceases to be true at any point between now and polling day,
the Government's policy would be in ruins. An inflation rate of 7% or 8%
would be the equivalent of ''Black Wednesday'' when Britain was driven
out of the European exchange rate mechanism.
At the moment, the Treasury forecasts are that inflation will end this
year at 3% and next year at 2.5%. With the cost of imports moving up,
some are suspicious of these figures and they note that the forecast
says nothing of what might be required in the way of interest rate rises
to keep inflation that low.
The Chancellor has to pray that world trade patterns do not see
pressure to raise rates and he will have to be careful when he cuts
taxes in the next Budget that he does not trigger a consumer boom which
could have the same effect.
Mr Clarke has said already that one of the achievements of this
Govermment in the next two years will be to cut taxes ''when we can
properly afford it.'' Yet he knows that politically the Government
cannot afford not to cut taxes.
His room for manoeuvre becomes more limited as the Treasury raises, as
it has just done, its forecast on borrowing to #23.6bn this financial
year (up from #21.5bn on the Budget forecast) and #16.1bn in 1996-97 (up
from a #13bn forecast).
There is a wide margin for error (about #4bn) in such forecasts but,
with heavy departmental spending towards the end of a financial year and
currently rather sluggish revenue collection, the odds seem to be on the
borrowing requirement going up rather than coming down.
That paves the way for a Labour accusation of borrowing in order to
cut taxes, the opposite of fiscal prudence. So the Chancellor has a
tightrope to walk, the next Budget trickier than the last because there
will be time for its effects to feed through before the election.
Ministers have made clear that the negative equity problem worrying
many voters cannot be tackled directly. They will have to rely on
general economic recovery boosting confidence but the Treasury is
pessimistic, not now expecting house prices to rise until the end of
1996.
In addition, the Chancellor needs his colleagues to clamp down on
spending to give him room for tax concessions despite the political
pressure to spend significantly more as the election draws nearer in
areas like health and education.
Mr Heseltine's political flair could come in useful here. What the
Government needs are some increases in high-profile cases that will make
the news while keeping overall budgets tight.
Closer to home, Mr Major has to do something about the Nolan
recommendations on MPs' standards and at least he no longer has to worry
too much about offending the interests of some of his backbench
colleagues.
They will have to face up to dropping consultancies and other nice
little earners or letting the public know how much they make from them.
The Scott Report on arms sales to Iraq could hit even harder, with
several of the Ministers who stand to be criticised now occupying even
higher-profile Cabinet roles.
The fact that Mr Major has gone ahead with such promotions is a
further indication that the Government will not accept large tracts of
the Scott Report and will reject some of its recommendations.
Given that the public will mostly start from the position that this is
Ministers looking out for themselves and at odds with an independent
inquiry, it will be a hard PR battle to win.
One additional advantage Mr Major should gain from bringing the
leadership contest forward is that the two Conservative Party
conferences possible before the election should be easier to handle. The
next is sufficiently near to the contest to ensure a resolute display of
unity, that in 1996 near enough to the election for the same to apply.
There is also, of course, the question of whether the Government can
make it to April 1997. The majority, only eight at the moment, will be
seven if the Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election is lost, as it
probably will be, later this month. A few more by-elections and the
majority will be gone and Mr Major's only hope of holding on is complete
dependence on the Ulster Unionists.
Whether the deep divisions on Europe can at least be muted remains to
be seen. Mr Major's ''Don't decide on a single currency till you have
to'' policy may just carry the party more or less together up to the
General Election. That in itself looks such a dicey operation that few
Tories feel like looking beyond it.
However, should Mr Major's fresh start be successful and the
Conservatives re-elected, decisions on Europe could no longer be put
off. The potential for a historic split is still there.
''But first,'' will say many Tory MPs, hoping their chances of keeping
their seats have improved by this week's work, ''let us win the
election.''

A CLYDESDALE Bank employee walked from Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday
after a charge of stealing from the bank was found not proven.
Mr Austen Campbell, 23, of The Auld Road, Cumbernauld, was accused of
stealing a box containing #40,000 in cash and #2000 in foreign currency
from the bank's headquarters in Glasgow.
The verdict came four months after a senior manager, responsible for
burning used notes, was found not guilty of embezzling #163,000.
Mr Hector MacGillivray, 54, of Thompson Drive, Bearsden, gave evidence
for the defence in Mr Campbell's trial, claiming he was harassed by
police questioning into making a confession.
He was in charge of the department when #42,000 disappeared he told
the court.
Mr Campbell was arrested and questioned about cars he bought after the
money disappeared in November 1992.
During the trial he told depute fiscal Ms Helen Nesbit that he had
used counterfeit money bought on the black market to buy the cars and
denied all knowledge of the stolen money.
He denied telling police that he had hidden the money in the ceiling
of the bank office and took it out over a period of time.
As he left court with his mother, Mr Campbell declined to comment.
Mr MacGillivray told his trial in the High Court in February that he
found #13,000 in old notes in the back of a wardrobe after his father
died.
He denied allegations from junior bank workers who claimed they had
seen him take used notes earmarked for incineration.
Clydesdale Bank officials declined to comment yesterday.

THE path of Conservative Party history is littered with the wrecked
careers of those who might once have expected to become Prime Minister.
Among them today lies that of Michael Ray Dibdin Heseltine, the new
First Secretary of State and deputy Prime Minister, who has now finally
kissed goodbye to his ambition.
He has riches and titles such as would stir the heart of a Third World
dictator. He has relinquished the Presidency of the Board of Trade, if
somewhat reluctantly, but only in exchange for greater prestige. This
is, after all, a man who has had his initials cast in iron in the
gateway of his impressive country home.
He now occupies the wholly unconstitutional role of deputy Prime
Minister, for which there is no provision in Britain's unwritten
constitution, and the historic title of First Secretary, last awarded to
R A Butler, one of the other great Tory would-be leaders of the post-war
years who also, in his time, required something by way of compensation.
Yet despite the casual brutality of political circumstance, by which
every additional vote for John Major on Tuesday was diminishing Michael
Heseltine's hopes for ever, he was not apparently even wistful
yesterday.
''I think he's rather pleased,'' said one of his closest friends.
''He's actually going to run the country.''
One of those stories that is always told is how, when he was at
Oxford, Michael Heseltine wrote on the back of an envelope how at the
summit of his career he planned to become Prime Minister.
The source of the story is his old friend and university chum, the
Tory MP Sir Julian Critchley. In Sir Julian's biography, however, we
discover that what the young Michael actually wrote against his
prospects for the 1990s, that evening was not ''Prime Minister'' but
''Downing Street''.
It may not have been what he intended, but ironically it turns out to
have been uncannily accurate.
There was some mystery about why it had been necessary for Mr
Heseltine to spend so long with the Prime Minister in the course of the
reshuffle talks. He was in No. 10 for three hours on Tuesday morning and
came out looking a bit grim.
He was there again on Tuesday evening, after the election result --
but, significantly, did not stay for the victory celebration party --
and he was back once more yesterday morning.
''It is not the kind of response of a guy who, on being told that he
is to be deputy Prime Minister, says: 'Yippee!','' said one acute
observer, a friend of Mr John Major.
However, according to Mr Heseltine's side the length of conversation
was necessary for him to persuade the Prime Minister against appointing
him as Conservative Party chairman. Instead, he put up a powerful case,
arguing that the presentation of Government policy should come from
Downing Street, not Smith Square; and that the party chairmanship should
not be allowed to matter as much as it has.
Michael Heseltine has never wanted to be party chairman. While widely
suggested last year that he had refused the post, in fact it looks
rather as if he started to mount his defensive strategy against being
appointed to it earlier than necessary.
Given that he was 62 last March, given that he is not going to be
Prime Minister, Mr Heseltine looks as if he has got much of what he
wanted. He will be operating from the Cabinet Office.
He has an abiding interest in efficiency, in how things work, and it
seems that as well as watching how Mr Brian Mawhinney performs, chairing
ten Cabinet committees and attending as many others as he may care to
investigate, he has also been given a special responsibility for making
the whole of Whitehall work better.
When he was first appointed to the Cabinet, as Environment Secretary
in 1979, he was responsible for introducing a system to make a
bureaucracy function more effectively.
He now has the whole of the Government machine under his say-so. He
has a deputy, Roger Freeman, the new Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster, who is himself a Cabinet Minister. He has, in short,
everything in effect he ever wanted. Everything except the one job that
really matters, that is.

SOME get sacked, some retire, some fall on their swords.
It was the sword for Jonathan Aitken yesterday when he resigned from
the Government as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. His roller coaster
political career has plunged into yet another of its many troughs.
The decision was no surprise. He has been in trouble for months over
allegations about the extent of his knowledge of illegal arms sales to
Iran by BMARC, a company on whose board he sat, and the affair of who
paid that Paris Ritz hotel bill. The Prime Minister accepted his
explanation that he knew nothing of the BMARC affair, and he showed he
had paid the bill -- eventually.
He gave every indication of trying to stay in his job and fight. But
Mr Major's decision to force a leadership contest changed the rules.
Maybe he went before he was pushed, but he can now defend his name in
the courts with no embarrassment to the Government. That could stand to
his credit in the future.
Mr Major last night signalled his willingness to take Mr Aitken back
into the Cabinet if he can clear his name in the courts.
In his reply to Mr Aitken's resignation letter the Prime Minister
wrote: ''I look forward to the time when you will have successfully
completed your legal battles and are ready to return to the
Government.''
Mr Major said he was ''sad'' to hear of the decision to resign and
paid a glowing tribute to Mr Aitken's work in office, describing him as
an ''exceptionally able'' Chief Secretary.
''I have admired the way you have combined charm and patience with a
steely determination to get results. And I have valued your support and
insight in Cabinet on many subjects,'' he wrote.
However, time is against Mr Aitken. He is 53, there should be no more
reshuffles in the lifetime of the Government, and who knows what the
General Election will bring?
In 1973 he said of his career: ''My life so far has been full of peaks
and valleys. There are presumably more dramas to come. I seem to have
the ability to stir up dramas.''It was a prescient remark.
He was a man who seemed destined to win the glittering prizes in
politics when he entered Parliament for Thanet South in 1974. But he
proved to be the one good-looking young man in a sharp suit whose charms
eluded Margaret Thatcher, probably because he had gone out with her
daughter Carol and, legend has it, made Carol cry when they split up.
After leaving Oxford in the early 1960s he had a spell as speechwriter
for Selwyn Lloyd, then Chancellor, and later became his private
secretary.
In 1966 he joined the family firm with a job on the Evening Standard
where he spent five years proving it was not a case of nepotism. He was
a very good journalist and reported with distinction from Biafra,
Vietnam, and the Middle East. It was a story he wrote for the Sunday
Telegraph about the Biafran war, based on a leaked Ministry of Defence
document, which led to his appearing in the Old Bailey in 1970 charged
under the Official Secrets Act.
He was acquitted, the Ministry of Defence was left with egg on its
face, but the case cost him the chance of standing in the 1970 election
and delayed his entry into the Commons for another four years.
Consigned to the back benches by Mrs Thatcher, he turned to making
money. Although Lord Beaverbrook was his great uncle, his branch of the
Aitken family is not rich. But, since his marriage in 1979 to Lolicia
Azucki, he has become a very wealthy man as a result of his business
activities. Many of his contacts, particularly in the Middle East, were
made when he was a journalist.
He was one of the founders of TV-am, set up a financial services
group, Aitken-Home, with his cousin, Tim, and acquired several
directorships -- it was his seat on the board of BMARC which has caused
the most recent trouble. He claims to have no knowledge of the arms
deals in question, having joined the board towards the end of the time
when they were taking place. Others from the company say he must have
known.
Mrs Thatcher's departure revived his political prospects. John Major
made him Minister of State for Defence Procurement, and last year he
went to the Treasury to cut Government spending.
The omens were good. Then came trouble with the BMARC row.

Passenger Transport Area was announced by the Scottish Office last night
-- and immediately attacked as not being enough.
The new area, which will come into force next year, does not cover the
whole of Strathclyde region, with large parts of Ayrshire and Argyll
being excluded from the rail subsidy and concessionary fare scheme.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, said
thousands of old people would miss out on concessionary fares and rail
support because of the decision.
''The new SPTA will cut east Ayrshire and south Ayrshire in half, with
part being immediately eligible for the concessionary fare scheme and
the other part ruled out,'' he said.
''This is divisive and unfair and will create great administrative
problems. Unless the new councils can come to quick agreements with the
new PTE then thousands of old people could lose their concessionary
fares.
''It is a victory for bureaucrats and a devastating defeat for many
old people in Ayrshire and other parts of Strathclyde.''
The SPTA's future has been under review as part of the shake-up of
local government in Scotland. It is currently operated within
Strathclyde region, but will be run by a joint board of elected
councillors when the region is abolished next year.
The size of the SPTA, which supports bus, road, and rail services, is
legally restricted to the boundaries of Greater Glasgow. However,
Strathclyde region had in practice, with the approval of the Scottish
Office, extended it to cover the whole region and it had been hoped that
that boundary would have been accepted by the Scottish Office.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said that the SPTA would be expanded to
cover the existing Strathclyde Zonecard travel area and the whole of the
present Strathclyde-supported rail network.
Strathclyde's roads and transport convener, Councillor Charles Gordon,
said of the decision: ''This is not good news. The Zonecard area does
not cover the bulk of Argyll or South Ayrshire.
''This means that extensive rural parts of these two areas will not be
entitled to concessionary benefits. We will have to study the
announcement and see who loses out.
''The boundaries can be extended again but only with the agreement of
other authorities and the Scottish Secretary. Out of the 12 new local
authorities that make up the old Strathclyde area no fewer than five
will find that they have elements of their district outside.''

THREE Scots have won promotion in the ministerial changes prompted by
the Cabinet reshuffle.
Iain Sproat, who has been a junior minister at the Department of
National Heritage, is promoted to Minister of State in the same
department.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton MP is a new Minister of State at the
Scottish Office. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, QC, will join Ian Lang at the
Department of Trade and Industry as a Minister of State. He will be
replaced at the Scottish Office by the Earl of Lindsay.
The reshuffle also sees promotion for four newcomers to the Cabinet.
Sir George Young, the ''bicycling baronet'' and new Transport
Secretary, is widely credited with street-wise experience and a
hard-edged social conscience.
But his ''worthy'' credentials have, on occasion, driven right-wingers
into uncontrollable frenzy.
Sir George, 53, who has always been regarded as a ''wet'', made an
untypically hard-line announcement at a Tory conference -- removing the
priority for single mothers in housing queues.
He argued that the situation where young mothers-to-be were given
priority for permanent accommodation created a ''perverse incentive'' to
become statutorily homeless.
Sir George hit the headlines in 1991 when he was accused of insulting
the homeless by saying, in a speech at a Tory dinner: ''They are the
sort of people you step on when you come out of the opera.''
1 Sir George, 6ft 5in, is the fifth to inherit a baronetcy conferred
on one of Lord Nelsons' three admirals at the Battle of Trafalgar in
1805.
Educated at Eton, and Christ Church, Oxford, he beat his cousin, Sir
Ian Gilmour, to win selection for the marginal west London seat of
Ealing Acton. He won at the February 1974 election and has held the seat
ever since.
William Hague was the child star who ''wowed'' the Tory conference at
the age of 16 and now, at 34, is the youngest member of the Cabinet.
So far the teenager Margaret Thatcher described as ''possibly another
young Pitt'' has lived up to all his early promise.
His appointment to the Welsh Office could be another step on the road
to No 10 by the man once marked out by a Tory grandee as ''the next
Prime Minister but 14''.
Educated at a comprehensive school, Mr Hague joined the Young
Conservatives aged 15.
As a student at Magdalen College, Oxford, he was elected President of
the Oxford Union, and graduated with a first class degree in philosophy,
politics, and economics.
In 1989, at the age of just 27, he scraped into Parliament as MP for
Richmond, Yorkshire, although with a disappointing majority of just 2634
in what had been a safe Tory seat.
Douglas Hogg, who has been credited with possessing a first-rate brain
combined with a juvenile personality, has shown himself to be a tough
and sometimes abrasive Foreign Office Minister.
Now moving to agriculture, the son and heir to Lord Hailsham has the
same clinical and logical outlook of the former Lord Chancellor. His
wife, Sarah, now a peeress, was head of the Downing Street policy unit.
One commentator wrote of Douglas Hogg: ''His mouth is one of the most
lethal instruments ever devised by man to do harm to his fellow men.''
He has a knack, through his pugnacious attitude, of inflaming those he
debates with.
Roger Freeman, promoted from the Ministry of Defence to become
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has been long regarded as ''a safe
pair of hands''. His reward has been steady progress up the ministerial
ladder.
His new job gives him responsibility for Civil Service issues and
de-regulation.
In other ministerial changes, Jeremy Hanley, the gaffe-prone party
chairman, is moved to the Foreign Office as Minister of State. Joining
him there is Euro-sceptic Sir Nicholas Bonsor, in his first Government
post.
Agriculture Minister Michael Jack moves to the Treasury as Financial
Secretary, while Ann Widdecombe becomes Minister of State at the Home
Office.
Ministers Robert Atkins (Environment), and Richard Needham (Trade and
Industry) have resigned.
Tony Baldry moves from the Foreign Office to Agriculture, while James
Arbuthnot switches from Social Security to Defence.
Lord Henley is promoted to education and employment Minister, and Lord
Ferrers and Robert Jones become Ministers of State at the Department of
Environment.
Alistair Burt is promoted to Minister of State at the Department of
Social Security, and Anthony Nelson becomes a trade and industry
Minister.
Deputy chief whip Gregory Knight becomes a Privy Councillor, and
Viscount Ullswater has resigned as Minister at the Department of
Environment.
Further changes will be announced today.

MICHAEL Forsyth's promotion provoked polite interest but little
empathy on the streets of his Stirling constituency yesterday.
''Good for him. He's obviously very intelligent and on the ball,''
said one man on the main street of Dunblane who pointedly refused to
give his name, ''but that can sometimes come across as arrogance, I
think. He's competent for the job, but I don't think he's really
approachable.''
Such reactions are not unusual. Many of his opponents and some of his
supporters admit he engenders respect but little warmth among his
constituents.
From the air, his seat must have looked like a safe landing spot for
the Conservative Party, a patchwork of rich farmland, some key tourist
spots, a smattering of bleak housing schemes and the sandstone solidity
of Stirling all interspersed with the large, imposing homes of the rich
and seriously wealthy.
On the ground, however it's a different picture. The electorate take
their politics very seriously, notching up some of Scotland's most
impressive turnouts in all kinds of elections, and they appear to
consider national issues just as important, if not more so, than what's
happening in their own backyard. Pundits describe the seat as one in
which no-one can feel secure.
Mr Jack McConnell, Labour's Scottish general secretary and a former
Labour group leader on Stirling District Council, said the electorate
was too eclectic to wield predictions about the constituency with any
great assurance.
''I think Stirling is very much a British constituency rather than a
Scottish constituency. It's affected by wider issues and does not have a
particularly traditional Scottish electorate. I think Stirling was
affected at the last election by the tax cut promises and I think now
that those promises were broken we will see the impact.''
Michael Forsyth has held the seat since 1983 and scrapd through with a
703 majority at the last election. Since then, however, the Tory
stronghold of Airthrey -- which includes Bridge of Allan -- has been
lopped off the constituency by the boundary commission and stitched on
to the new Ochil parliamentary seat.
Mr Forsyth was outraged at the move and tried to rally the community,
somewhat unsuccessfully, behind him. Most political observers saw it as
the end of the road for the MP, but Labour is taking no chances.
Jack McConnell said: ''We have appointed a full-time organiser in the
constituency and we are preparing for this constituency as one of the
real marginal seats in Scotland.''
Conservative councillor Helen Scott, who has been involved in local
politics in the area for almost 30 years, agrees with Mr McConnell that
the seat is not one that can be easily classified.
''We have got one of the areas of highest deprivation which is Raploch
in Stirling. I think really Stirling carries almost all parts that you
can find elsewhere in Scotland.''
She is quick to defend her MP on charges that he is respected but not
liked in the constituency.
''Before the last election, his wife said to me that when they were
walking along the main street in Callander people were crossing the road
to come over and shake him by the hand to thank him for what he has
done.
''There are people throughout the constituency for whom he has solved
problems and who have a gratitude towards him.''
She thinks the appointment as Scottish Secretary can only boost his
profile and bode well for his chances in the next election.
James Hamilton would disagree. A resident of Raploch, the Stirling
estate once called a ''Higher-free zone'', Mr Hamilton doesn't think it
will make much difference to him who is in the hot seat in Scotland.
As he fiddles under the bonnet of his broken-down car, Mr Hamilton 53,
said: ''I hadn't heard about the appointment and to be honest I don't
care.'' He paused and wiped his hand on an oily rag. ''Anyway, the
Government is in such a mess that it won't matter who they put in, will
it?''

MY first recollection of Michael Forsyth as a headline-maker was when
he denounced the ''Marxist infiltration'' of the Scottish Women's Rural
Institute, who had dared to publish words critical of his heroine, Mrs
Thatcher.
Verily, Mr Forsyth has travelled a long way from there. He now becomes
beneficiary of the fact that there are very few Tory MPs in Scotland and
even fewer -- one, in fact -- who is remotely eligible to fill the
Scottish Office vacuum.
Ian Lang having effected his escape, John Major has little option but
to reward Forsyth for relatively good behaviour. The ideologue returns.
Outside his little right-wing bruderbund, it is a prospect which will be
greeted with emotions ranging from apprehension to downright alarm.
Nowhere, however, will it be more divisive than within the Scottish
Conservative Party itself -- for it is there that Mr Forsyth and his
ways are known best. This was the man sent in by Mrs Thatcher to revamp
the Scottish Tory machine, who then had to be pulled out with mayhem all
around him.
A trail of wide-eyed gurus of extremism came and went in his wake. If
the pattern is repeated, Scottish Office civil servants will soon find
some very curious young men with sharp suits, short hair and
transatlantic accents in their midst.
In the short term, however, I suspect that Forsyth will play a rather
different game. The high priest of the poll tax and cutting poor folks'
wages may, for the time being, be anxious to offer himself as Mr
Concensus. In true Thatcherite style, the voice will be softened to
denote caring.
No hospital ward will be safe from Forsyth-generated photo
opportunities. The rest of the Scottish Office line-up will be
eliminated from public inspection as the great man seeks to present
himself as the ubiquitous champion of good works. ''Perhaps,'' the
nation will be invited to conclude, ''he's not such a bad chap after
all. But he was and is.
If there is to be a ideological retreat,it will be purely tactical.
The man who claims that Scotland should have been ''dancing in the
streets'' in celebration of the poll tax has not changed his spots.
Between now and the General Election, however, the name of his game will
be survival.
With the Scottish Tories so low in the polls, without control of any
local authority and back down to 10 MPs, he might reasonably conclude
that it is a time for being Mr Nice rather than Mr Nasty if a modest
revival is to be staged.
But Forsyth's zealotry on behalf of the poll tax is the key to his
thinking. Of course, a minority gained handsomely under it, and had
personal cause to dance in the streets. Forsyth's miscalculation was
that they would neither know or care what was happening to the losers
three streets along.
He was wrong about that and it was the single biggest reason why he
found himself shedding tears into late-night drams of defeat with Mrs
Thatcher. But if there is one continuing believer in trickle-down
economics, with the less well-off dependent on drips from the rich man's
fountain, it is Michael Forsyth.
The other key to his politics lies in his early career in the guise of
Michael Forsyth Limited -- consultants to any public authority which
would ditch its own staff and contract out the work to a private
company. His business soon became his politics.
Throughout Scotland and beyond, hundreds of thousands of people doing
decent jobs for modest pay were cast on the scrap-heap -- or else
obliged to do the same work for miserable rewards and with every right
and condition taken away from them. Even more than the poll tax, that is
the Forsyth Doctrine personified.
It was entirely appropriate that, as a Minister at the Department of
Employment, he destroyed the Wages Councils. As much as any politician
of the past 16 years, Michael Forsyth is architect and practitioner in
the miserable construction of Britain's low-wage economy.
The sweetest irony of his career, however, was when he was obliged --
with gritted teeth -- to put through the ''TUPE legislation''. This
amount to a confession by the Tories that the whole contracting-out
programme, where it resulted in cutting wages and conditions, had been
in breach of European law.
There is no doubt that Michael Forsyth will bring a sharper edge to
Scottish Tory politics. The attacks on opponents will be meaner and he
will doubtless take up where he left off, in seeking to turn the Civil
Service into an extension of the Tory propaganda machine.
On the constitutional issue, the first question is whether he adopts
the Lang/Major approach of condemning every proposal for change as a
threat to the Union. Or will he try something more original? Given his
own constituency circumstances, he will soft-pedal his attacks on
Nationalism while directing all the bile at Labour -- which he correctly
identifies as his true foe.
Indeed, Forsyth's marginal seat is a big factor in all of this. He is
no stranger to pork-barrel politics, and occupancy of the Scottish
Office is the key to being able to deliver. Past experience tells him
that getting his mug on the telly often enough, in photo-opportunity
circumstances, helps save his seat. Will the broadcasters have the
bottle not to oblige?
He will target Labour councils which he considers ripe for
vilification and may even adopt the more subtle approach of giving them
more powers and spending consent, in the hope that they hang themselves
-- an idea touted by John Redwood during his leadership campaign.
With Forsyth, his opponents will know that they are in a contest. But
the bottom line will not change much. Forsyth will be the Tories' man in
Scotland, and it is the Tories collectively rather than individually who
have put themselves beyond the electoral pale. Forsyth will not save
them.

EIGHT people died and 33 were injured yesterday when a coach packed
with passengers on a sightseeing trip crashed on to a roundabout and
ploughed into trees.
The accident took place in good weather, and investigators were
considering whether speed was a major factor.
The bus driver's pregnant wife and their two-year-old son were thrown
clear in the crash.
There were immediate calls for seatbelts to be made compulsory in all
coaches and minibuses.
It happened near the village of Raglan in Gwent, south Wales, on the
A40. Eyewitnesses said the scene was like a ''battlefield''.
Some people had been thrown through windows and crushed beneath the
toppled bus. Others were trapped by trees which had been forced through
the side of the coach.
Three of the most seriously-injured passengers were critical last
night in intensive care in the Abergavenny hospital, while six others
were still undergoing surgery. A total of 22 passengers were seriously
injured.
Those who died, who have yet to be named, are not thought to include
any children.
The 53-seater coach was taking people and staff from the St David's
Centre in Aberdare on a sightseeing trip to Stratford-upon-Avon. The day
centre is run by Mid Glamorgan social services for people recovering
from mental disorders who live in the community.
Firefighters used specialised equipment to cut free 25 passengers,
including children. Four of the most seriously-injured were flown to
hospital by helicopter. A fleet of 21 ambulances dealt with the other
casualties.
The seven-year-old vehicle was operated by Lewis Coaches of Aberdare.
The company said it did not have seatbelts but was well maintained and
one of eight in its fleet.
The coach driver, Mr Philip Crisp, 30, was being treated for shock but
was described as ''only slightly injured''.
Gwent police said the coach was involved in a ''slight collision''
seconds before the fatal crash. But that incident was not thought to
have contributed to the accident at a roundabout near Raglan Castle,
they added.
Emergency services arriving at the scene faced ''utter carnage'', said
police. Superintendent Kenneth le Prevost of Gwent Police described it
as ''devastation''.
He said the accident happened on the flat surface of the roundabout.
The coach tumbled on its side and spun round in the opposite direction.
Pensioner George Plowman, of Fairfax View, Raglan, was one of the
first on the scene.
He said: ''I heard a loud bang and rushed from my garden and I was
joined by men from the roadworks site and we tried to comfort the
passengers as best we could.
''The coach driver was lying on the ground, totally shell-shocked.
Many others were lying around him, covered in blood.''
Mr Nigel Watkins, from a garage nearby, said: ''It was like a
battlefield.
''The coach had tipped over into the trees and they had all gone
through the side of the coach trapping the passengers. Others were in a
really bad way and were trapped by the trees inside the coach.''
Mr Richard Jones, deputy director of Mid Glamorgan Social Services,
said: ''It was just a simple day out, so that the clients could enjoy
seeing the sights of Stratford.''
Seven passengers were dead at the scene and another was found to be
dead on arrival at hospital.
Labour, the Consumers' Association and the British Safety Council all
called for seatbelts to be made compulsory in all coaches and minibuses.
At present the Government is planning legislation to ensure belts are
compulsory in all coaches and minibuses which carry children.
The European Commission is to introduce measures which will mean all
new coaches will have to have belts fitted from next year.
Europe's transport commissioner, Mr Neil Kinnock, pledged new coach
safety laws would be in operation throughout Europe by October next
year.
Nine teenage Army apprentices were praised for helping to comfort
survivors before the emergency services arrived.
The cadets, with three instructors, pulled up in their minibus and
were among the first on the scene.
Corporal Chris Collett, 28, from Trowbidge, Wiltshire, in charge of
the party, said: ''There were people obviously dead in the wreckage and
others walking around badly-injured or dazed. I did what I could to
organise what help was around.
''All the apprentices performed magnificently. They are on a two-week
leadership course but obviously did not expect to be confronted with
anything like this.
''We tried to keep them away from the worse of the mayhem, but we
shall be keeping a close eye on them after this trauma.''

MALCOLM Rifkind's appointment as Foreign Secretary will ''cause dismay
across Europe,'' the European Parliament's socialist group complained
last night.
Mrs Pauline Green, the British Labour Euro-MP who leads the group of
221, said: ''It is urgent that the new Cabinet gives an early signal
that it has changed its tune on Europe.
''Up to now, the Government has been hypnotised into inaction by the
Euro-sceptics.
''Mr Rifkind will not inspire confidence in Britain as a European
partner and unless he gives clear signals of a changed approach in the
next few days it will be Britain that is the loser.''
Mr Rifkind is the most outspokenly anti-American Foreign Secretary in
recent memory, (writes Patrick Brogan from Washington)
He has been at the sharp end of Britain's Bosnian involvement from the
beginning and therefore has felt more keenly than his colleagues the
vacillations and hesitations of American Balkan policy. He goes to the
United States twice a year and every time and each time more strongly,
he has accused the Americans of proposing dangerous policies for others,
meaning Britain, to follow.
He has repeatedly denounced the idea that the arms embargo against
Bosnia should be lifted. He asserts that Americans have no business
making such decisions without having troops on the ground.
In decades past, British politicians who opposed, or were sceptical,
of British involvement with Europe looked to the United States as the
more natural alliance. Unless Mr Rifkind is more moderate in his views
of American policy as Foreign Secretary than he was as Defence
Secretary, he will have to cleave more closely to Europe. There is no
longer any mid-Atlantic third way.

THE Prime Minister's decision to abolish the Employment Department
provoked a furious reaction last night, with strong criticism from
Scottish opposition politicians and union leaders.
Although not entirely unexpected, the move to scrap the department and
divide its duties among other Government departments was being seen as
symptomatic of a Tory Party which is widely regarded as unsympathetic
towards the unemployed.
The decision also brought fears of Civil Service job losses among the
department's 55,000 staff, including a large number in Scotland. A
spokesman said it was not yet clear how the change would affect the
Scottish Office.
The new Department for Education and Employment, headed by former
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard, will take over the work of
overseeing training schemes and promoting equal opportunities.
Mrs Shephard, who also becomes Minister for Women, said she was
''thrilled'' at her new responsibility. ''The Prime Minister's
imaginative decision to merge the Departments of Education and
Employment gives the clearest possible signal that education and
training are at the very top of the Government's agenda.''
Mrs Shephard said it was ''far too early'' to say whether there would
be job losses.
Labour and union officials called for urgent talks about the future of
the workers.
Scottish Shadow employment spokesman John McFall said it ''shows that
the Government wants to sweep employment issues under the carpet''.
SNP employment spokesman Ms Roseanna Cunningham said the move
''confirms the low priority the Tories have on addressing
unemployment''.
Mrs Ray Michie, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said: ''Scrapping
the department is indicative of the contempt in which the Tories hold
the unemployed''.
STUC deputy general secretary Bill Speirs said it was a contemptible
insult to the millions consigned to the dole queues by Tory policy.
''This act makes crystal clear just how far John Major is now in the
clutches of the Tory hard right.''
Speaker Betty Boothroyd promised she would investigate Labour protests
about whether the Government could scrap the Department without changing
Commons rules.
Mr John Sheldon, general secretary of the National Union of Civil and
Public Servants, said the merger had been worked out ''on the back of an
envelope'' without thinking about the impact on training and job
placement.
Even former Employment Secretary Michael Portillo, who became Defence
Secretary in the reshuffle, admitted the axing of the Department would
be ''quite a shock'' to the staff, who said the decision had come ''like
a bombshell'' to them.
The department's permanent secretary, Mr Michael Bichard, told staff
in a memo that responsibility for training, the labour market,
employment, and equal opportunities would switch to the new department.
Responsibility for industrial relations, pay, redundancy payments,
work permits, Acas, and industrial tribunals would go to the Department
of Trade and Industry, while health and safety would move to the
Environment Department.
Employment statistics, including the monthly unemployment figures,
would transfer to the Central Statistical Office.

''IT'S Reservoir Dogs 2,'' a senior Scottish Conservative choked
yesterday when it was confirmed that Michael Forsyth was to become
Secretary of State for Scotland.
It is easy to see what he meant. Out goes the louche, urbane Ian Lang
whose matinee idol looks are straight from central casting. In comes a
cold, calculating character with raw energy so beloved of Tarantino.
This stereotyping, nevertheless, may be somewhat naive. Forsyth, The
Sequel, promises to be better. Tighter direction and an incisive script
are predicted although Oscar-winning qualities of romance mixed with
humour and a happy ending are not guaranteed. The star, however, is a
more consummate performer.
His role on the larger stage of the Department of Employment,
especially his negotiations in Brussels, have won him some rave reviews.
He is no longer the zealous novice who was cast as Scottish Tory Party
chairman under the then Mrs Thatcher.
At that period in the late 80s, he upset as many within the Scottish
Tories as he did on the Opposition benches. These wounds have not
healed. Forsyth's supporters at the time of his sacking as chairman, a
result of unprecedented anger from within the party, claimed that few
were accepted as prophets in their own land. This may be so but even
fewer attempt to return as the Messiah.
His unrestrained Thatcherism alienated him from huge sections of the
party, principally the left-leaning Tory Reform Group. Its diminutive
chairman, Arthur Bell, was especially a target by the Forsyth camp and
was subjected to a remarkable, albeit imaginative, variety of size-ist
insults. He symbolised all that was thought wrong with the Tories in
Scotland. Consensus-seeking, conciliatory, wedded to a liberal agenda
and flirting with devolution -- all anathema to Forsyth.
But Bell, no slouch with the wounding retort, was able to punch well
above his weight and with establishment figures such as Peter, now Lord,
Fraser, and former Scottish Secretary George Younger in his corner,
represented a formidable foe.
But probably the most extraordinary episode and the one which caused
the deepest split within the party was the attempted ''coup'' to depose
Malcolm Rifkind as Scottish Secretary.
It broke at the party conference in Aberdeen when Bill Walker, playing
the Fool to Forsyth's King Lear railing against the elements on the
blasted political heath, put out ambiguous statements that the
revolution which had engulfed the party was now set to march on St
Andrew's House and unseat Mr Rifkind who had fallen out of favour with
the Prime Minister.
There followed a number of secret meetings involving over-enthusiastic
Forsyth aides who attempted to persuade certain sections of the media
that the King Was Dead, Long Live The King.
Meanwhile, back at Central Office there was panic. Redundancy notices
were floating around like confetti at a wedding as the new party
chairman dispensed with the old and brought in the new, the very new, in
fact, in the form of a series of bright young men barely in their 20s.
If that was not a big enough slap in the face to the old hands they
were astounded when a brash young American election expert was drafted
in to analyse the party's problems and recommend a solution.
The revolution was going too far and too swiftly. ''It was not so much
Newt Gingrich, more Tiddler Gingrich,'' says a party cynic. It was a
view shared in the Scottish health and education establishments over
which Mr Forsyth presided as Minister.
Mr Forsyth was fighting on too many fronts and his pimple-faced aides
lacked acumen. So when senior figures within the Scottish Conservatives
demanded that Mrs Thatcher remove him from the chairmanship even she, a
fervent admirer, succumbed.
The problem now for Mr Forsyth is that his return may well revive
those demons which have been laid to rest.
Already some Scottish Tory MPs are hinting at rebellion -- Sir Hector
Monro being one now that he is to quit his seat anyway. But there are
more formidable figures like Sir Michael Hirst, the present Scottish
chairman, who will be uneasy at his appointment.
Ministerial colleagues like George Kynoch, Lord Fraser, and back
benchers such as Raymond Robertson, will share that discomfiture.
The Labour Party has already branded him Mr Poll Tax and the
Nationalists predict he will be the most unpopular Scottish Secretary
ever. Herein lies a clue to his appointment. Who else could cause such
consternation?
The climate within the Conservative Party has also changed. John
Major, on becoming Prime Minister, and having heard the scare stories,
had considered sacking Mr Forsyth.
Remarkably, it was the intervention of Malcolm Rifkind who spoke
highly of his former adversary's abilities which kept him his job. It is
for this reason that the right-wing Forsyth, who could sit comfortably
in a Redwood Cabinet, was one of the first to offer his loyalty to John
Major in the leadership election.
Of course, it would not have escaped him that as Ian Lang was a
principal Major backer, should the Prime Minister be re-elected Lang
would win promotion. That would leave the Scottish Secretaryship vacant.
In which case there could be only one candidate.
But why quit a national post for a Scottish one, albeit one with a
Cabinet seat, when his last adventure in his home country had proved
such a traumatic experience?
Part of the answer is the growing grass roots party support for him in
Scotland. At the end of the last Scottish Tory conference a large
section of the audience remained behind to attend a fringe meeting to
hear him speak. What they heard was the one Scottish Tory who could
articulate with passion and aggression the Prime Minister's defence of
the Union.
If anyone can muster the arguments to persuade his fellow countrymen
of the benefits of the Union, the anomalies in devolution and the
suicide of separatism, then he can.
He singlehandedly destroyed the Labour Party's local government
finance policy which he scathingly branded a ''roof tax''. He was also
one of the few Tory MPs in Scotland to increase his share of the vote in
his own constituency. Whatever you think of Mr Forsyth he is
exceptional.
Everyone agrees he is a street fighter. He is the sole Scots Tory who
frightens Labour. His handling of the Monklands controversy should be a
delight to behold.
As the Perth and Kinross by-election demonstrated, the Tory vote has
not fled to Labour or the Nationalists. Much of it languishes sadly and
unhappily, at home. Forsyth is the man to enthuse it.
He needs to do the same to the party workers, who are depressed and
despondent, and to bolster party organisation which has collapsed. John
Major is right to harness Mr Forsyth's enthusiasm and skills not to
mention his cunning.
Mr Forsyth will still be a wolf, but in sheep's clothing.
