EXCLUSIVE
THE Scottish Tory peer and holiday park owner named in the Gas Bill
''cash-for-amendments'' scandal has been accused of an involvement in a
bogus application for licence forms in connection with piped supplies to
caravans.
The application was made in the name of Mr H Grimsby-Smith of
Wandsworth, London, according to the gas industry's regulatory body
Ofgas.
Lord Cochrane of Cults was told in a letter from the watchdog's then
director general, Mr James McKinnon, that such an action was
''irresponsible, at the very best''.
Earlier this week, Lord Cochrane, owner of Craigtoun Meadows Holiday
Park in St Andrews, was embroiled in the cash-for-amendments furore
surrounding ex-Tory Minister Sir Jerry Wiggin.
Sir Jerry, a paid adviser to the British Holiday and Home Parks
Association, faces suspension from the Commons. He tabled an amendment
to the Gas Bill which would promote BHHPA's interests by cutting red
tape on gas supplies under the name of MP Sebastian Coe -- without Mr
Coe's knowledge or permission.
It is now alleged that Lord Cochrane -- who merely advised the BHHPA
on drafting the amendment which went to Sir Jerry -- has also used a
third party to promote personal interests.
For years he has championed efforts to remove bureaucracy in the
supply of gas to holiday homes. In 1993, he raised a private member's
Bill in the Lords to exempt liquid propane gas suppliers such as caravan
park owners from the bureaucracy and regulation costs.
The alleged bogus application to Ofgas was made in 1991 when Lord
Cochrane, facing tough regulations at his holiday park, was involved in
a long-running battle with Ofgas over his application for supplies.
The Herald can reveal that, in a letter to Lord Cochrane that year, Mr
McKinnon told him that, in the course of reviewing his case, he had
established that an application in the name of Mr H Grimsby-Smith of
Wandsworth, London, was also made.
He wrote: ''As far as I can determine, that was a bogus application
which we had followed up. I can only say that I regard such an
application as irresponsible, at the very best.''
It would appear that -- in his mission to cut red tape -- Lord
Cochrane had wanted to expose shortcomings within Ofgas, the Office of
Gas Supply, including charges to customers and the timescales involved
in processing applications.
Ofgas was established in 1986 and legislation drafted which subjected
LPG suppliers to the same regulations as mains gas suppliers.
According to sources, Lord Cochrane, 68, has also used
''Grimsby-Smith'' to obtain information from rivals in the holiday park
industry, including the receipt of brochures and prices.
Lord Cochrane, who lives near Cupar, said yesterday that the
application to Ofgas was to test its ''extremely unsatisfactory
procedures''. He stressed that the application had not been made by him.
However, Lord Cochrane's lawyers later confirmed he had asked a third
party to apply for forms from Ofgas.
The explanation for doing so was that Lord Cochrane was ''genuinely
interested in what the administrative follow-up procedures of Ofgas were
on applications for such forms''.
The statement concluded that there was some concern at the time that
any such application was treated as a formal application and followed up
accordingly.
Lord Cochrane insisted: ''My actions were justified . . . it was a
test of routine Ofgas procedures that were extremely unsatisfactory. I
did not make the application. Why should I tell you who did?''
He said there was a Grimsby-Smith, but would not elaborate. At
Craigtoun Meadows yesterday, no-one had heard such a name.
In his letter, Mr McKinnon -- clearly annoyed at Ofgas spending time
and money on a bogus application -- also refers to a dispute over its
charge for the Section 8 application sought by Craigtoun Meadows Ltd,
chaired by Lord Cochrane.
Ofgas had originally quoted #288.75 for the licence, but on
considering the work expended on the application -- including the legal,
safety and security regulations -- the final bill came to just under
#400.
Mr McKinnon wrote that the bill represented ''exceptional value for
money.'' He added that, in the interests of Lord Cochrane's customers,
the matter would be drawn to a close and the charge of #288.75p would
stand, despite the much higher actual costs laid out in the case.
The letter concluded with the allegation that Mr McKinnon had
determined, as far as he could, that the application made in the name of
Mr H Grimsby-Smith was bogus.
An Ofgas spokesman said yesterday that it had started work on the
basis of a ''Grimsby-Smith'' telephone call requesting an information
pack and licence application forms.

THE fishing fleet in the East Neuk of Fife is facing a crisis and is
appealing for Government finance for a major modernisation programme.
North-East Fife MP Mr Menzies Campbell said yesterday that, in private
talks with him, the East Fife skippers had voiced ''considerable
anxiety'' about the ageing fleet.
''The fishermen expressed their concern over the future of the smaller
boats in the Scottish fleet, which are so important to the economy of
particular communities such as Pittenweem,'' Mr Campbell said. The
Pittenweem fleet was in urgent need of modernisation.
In an appeal for financial assistance to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang,
Mr Campbell said: ''Many of the vessels are approximately 20 years old.
The age of a vessel has considerable implications for its safety, quite
apart from the need to maintain an efficient and up-to-date fleet.''
Mr Campbell has made it clear that the current economic conditions in
the community would not allow investment to modernise the fleet, and
Government intervention now was required.
He added: ''In North-East Fife, the fishing industry is a vital part
of the local economy. Unless the fleet is modernised, it will suffer a
slow but inevitable rundown.''
He called on the Scottish Secretary to make clear the Government's
policy regarding the maintenance of the village-based fishing industry
and what steps are being taken to ensure it continues.

A YOUNG Manchester United fan from the Black Isle in Ross-shire will
be at Wembley today after winning an all-expenses paid trip to the FA
Cup final.
Rachel MacSween, 14, entered a contest to write a report on a
televised match for a football magazine.
She said yesterday: ''A friend at school, who got the magazine a day
before me, told me I had won. I couldn't believe it.''
Rachel is being accompanied to Wembley by her father, Calum, the
deputy rector at Fortrose Academy.
She has her reporter's notebook at the ready -- part of her prize is
to write her own match report of the United and Everton match for Shoot
magazine.
''I started being interest in Manchester United about two years ago,''
explained Rachel. ''The attraction was Ryan Giggs and Paul Ince, but
then I realised what a great team they are and now I support them all.
''I've got tickets for Manchester United's match against East Fife in
August, but this is the first time I'll have seen them play live.''

THEY'RE called Birds of Paradise. Otherwise a tongue-twisting
strelitzia reginae. And they're gorgeous, evergreen perennials that make
really delightful house plants, with those unique flower heads for all
the world like a bird's head.
Very common in their native South Africa, they're not quite so
everyday in this part of the world. It's possible to grow them from
seed, the experts say, but you need a fair bit of patience for that. It
can take up to six months for germination, and possibly two years for a
flower to appear.
Not every garden centre stocks the seeds -- seven cost #2.29 -- but
the Ipswich-based Thompson &amp; Morgan supply them. They may need potting
on every other year, when shoots can be be taken for propagating in John
Innes No 3 potting compost.
''The real secret is to keep the winter temperature around 55deg F and
the best place would be a conservatory,'' says Andrew Duncan of Duncan's
of Milngavie. ''They're striking plants, and it so happens we have just
sold one we had been looking after at the centre for a year or two.
''This one was four years old, in a large container, standing about
three feet high. It went for well over #100. A beautiful plant.''

IT'S nip-and-tuck time in the garden. Attending to fiddly jobs
requires patience. Top priority is support for plants like herbaceous
perennials.
If not supported, they can flop and never be the same again. Various
methods are suitable. Strong twigs can be pushed into the ground. Use a
crowbar to make the hole.
I prefer stout stakes, in the middle of clumps, and loop strong green
twine round the plants. It avoids that sack-of-potatoes look.
Sweet peas need support, too, and you have to decide whether to grow
them as single cordons on canes, or as a hedge when strings or netting
will suit.
In the vegetable garden, normal peas need support too. If they don't
get it, they flop and the pods rot. I use wide mesh sheet netting and
stakes.
Then there are climbing or rambler roses. Are they against a fence or
a wall? In the latter case, wall nails are needed. Alternatively,
trellis can be put up to avoid damage.
Some shrubs, such as Russian vine and clematis montana, support
themselves, twining round rustic fences. But there may come a time when
restriction is needed.
If you fed your lawn in mid-April, it could need light feeding again,
particularly if it has developed a layer of thatch over the years.
Skimping regular mowing can do irreparable harm. So can over-close
cutting.
There is also pinching and supporting to do in the greenhouse.
Tomatoes are growing lustily. They need regular twisting round string or
tying to canes.
Side-shoots have to be removed, unless you prefer to grow on two or
three stems -- a perfectly practical arrangement. Remember, you will
need more water and feeding for the extra stems and fruit.
Spring bedding displays are fading. Decide whether you will save bulbs
for next year. If so, let them die back naturally in a dry spot, with
plenty of air.

THE irony about some shrubs is that, when you first plant them, you
want them to grow quickly -- then they just keep growing till they
become a big problem.
They can overhang the lawn, obstruct access, or generally make a
nuisance of themselves. So what do you do about it?
You obviously don't want to be pruning drastically when a shrub will
flower in the next month or so. That would deprive you of the colour it
was planted to provide.
Nor do you wish to be too harsh with a shrub that has just flowered,
and destroy the new wood where flowering will take place next year.
The logical answer is moderation rather than drastic cutting back.
Many vigorous shrubs do not seem in the least deterred by harsh cutting.
Things like flowering currants, many berberis, Portuguese laurel, and
Philadelphus fall into this category.
Cytisus or broom, and the popular azaleas, come into the moderate
pruning category -- after flowering, of course.
You can't suppress enthusiasm for growth. Some shrubs thrive on being
cut back hard in the autumn or early spring. They break away with new
growth. I can think of hardy fuchsias in this respect, along with Cornus
alba varieties.
The green-leaved varieties can be cut to within a few inches of the
ground, any time in early spring, every few years. Pruning back a third
of the variegated types gives the best compromise between good leaf
cover and brightly coloured stems.
There are lots of shrubs which perform well with little or no regular
pruning. Romping away at times does them no harm at all. If you are
really concerned, take time to refer to a good reference work or ask at
a centre where they have an advice desk.

* ONE of the most invasive of garden pests, and possibly the most
difficult to control, is black vine weevil -- Otiorhynchus sulcatus --
which can be found in gardens, greenhouses and even indoors throughout
Britain.
Gardeners are being warned of accelerated development of the weevil
larva -- which means that pupation and emergence of adults may be
earlier than normal -- and have been turning to biological control, as
other methods have not been successful in preventing population growth.
The adult is a small black beetle-like insect, seldom seen because it
is nocturnal and hides among pots and stones during the day. Its
presence is shown by irregular holes in leaves and shrubs. It attacks
young shoots, especially camellias and rhododendrons.
Male weevils can't fly but will get into glasshouses and neighbouring
gardens. The female has potential for a serious infestation of the main
enemy, the larva, as a single adult female can lay up to 1000 eggs in
soil or potting compost. The larva is is white and up to 8mm long. Once
hatched, it will feed over three months before pupating, and the damage
caused is widespread. It will attack both house and greenhouse plants.
Most susceptible are fuchsias, primulas, begonias and cyclamen.
The use of nematodes as biological control has been possible for
several years. They are released into the soil, increasing the
indigenous population, and search out host larva on which to feed. The
nematodes invade the larva and inject a bacterium which kills the larva
by blood poisoning. Nematodes develop and reproduce new generations. The
main controlling factor is soil temperature.
Nematodes are inactive below 10deg C and need 14deg C before they
start searching out the larva. Pan Britannic Industries launched the
Biosafe system in 1994 and it was a great success. There is now have a
new formulation, WDG, which is said to offer considerable advantages.
Today's tips
* THE intrusion of coarse grass into your lawn is bothersome. It's so
prostrate the mower skips over them, so if you have a cylinder mower,
try the wire rake attachment to bring the grass upright for
close-cutting.
* Be wary of turfing now, unless you're prepared to water regularly
until new turf is established. If going ahead, fork the laying ground
and put on a dressing of coarse sand. But early autumn is a better time.
* PLASTIC lemonade bottles, with bottoms cut off, make excellent
mini-cloches for a variety of plants. They should be pushed well into
the ground to stop them blowing away. Dut don't forget to leave the cap
off as ventilation.

KITCHENS reveal a lot about their cooks. Gerry Goldwyre's, in a
converted outhouse, is a scaled-down version of the professional chef's,
with the overhead rack of pans and ladles, giant ice-cream machine,
industrial oven, and ferocious gas rings. A net of Sainsbury's lemons
spills on the counter, the coriander plant has lost most of its leaves.
The famous blow torch, which so impressed the Masterchef judges, is
there too. The dishes from last night's demonstration are still dirty.
He runs hot water over them and makes a powerful cup of Nescafe Blend
37.
Goldwyre won television's coveted foodie award in 1994. Now, after a
year of planning and learning, he has a scheme of his own. Collaborating
with Goan cook Abha Rodriguez, he has created an east-meets-west
cuisine, which, he reckons, can't fail. With typical serendipity, he
bumped into Rodriguez in a restaurant.
Untypically, for someone so media-friendly, he hasn't given his new
baby a catchy name.
''I always had fantastic interest in food from the Indian
sub-continent, the Far and Middle East, India. Curry is perceived by
most people as something you have after nine pints, you go for a
vindaloo with extra chillies on the way home. I know it's better than
that, so about six months ago I set about analysing that kind of food.
How could we use it in a classic way, mixing a combination of classic
cooking styles with the Indian sub-continent's spices. We've come up
with some real little gems.''
He acquired his hot tooth when he was working as an architect in the
Middle East and eating in the newspaper-for-tablecloth joints frequented
by Indian labourers. ''But it never ever looked good, that was the only
drawback. Even with colour and herbs on the top it never ever looked
attractive.
''For years, I've tortured myself, wondering how I can make it look
better. I came up with this idea of using the spices and herbs almost as
infusions, as starters for sauces. Now if I was making a vegetable
stock, or beurre blanc, I'd add some pastes that I've made up, so it
would get the flavours but not be totally overpowering.''
These pungent potions, the spicy hearts of his east-meets-west dishes,
live in large coffee jars. Unlabelled, they don't have names, just
working descriptions: ''This is my spicy tapenade'', ''Try this chilli
jam''.
As his Masterchef appearances illustrated, Goldwyre is a ''really
risky, shoot from the hip, have a go'' kind of cook. Give him a carrier
bag of goodies, a few pans and a blow torch and he'll make dinner. He
develops his recipes in the same way. In his ideal kitchen, which he
designed himself, with a fridge full of goodies and a shelf of booze and
oils, he makes it up as he goes along.
''I was doing puris in here with Abha and I thought, I could do
something with this, so I pulled out all my bits, mixed some feta
cheese, sun-dried tomato and coriander, put them inside. Then I'd maybe
sprinkle some cumin, some coriander over the top.'' Other ideas are at
different stages of gestation.
''Pasta, with spices in the dough. That's something I want to do next.
I made some bread last week, with fresh coriander. It was sensational.
Now I want to use it as polenta, with a salad. See those little creme
brulees? I'm going to flavour them with a teabag full of cardamoms.''
Television has made all this possible. The publicity that followed his
Masterchef victory, watched by 12 million, has allowed him to add
cooking to architecture and watercolour painting as his money-spinning
occupations. Having seen how the media works, he's convinced that his
new venture is perfect for the cameras.
''There are so many angles: the combination of vegetarian Asian female
and a carnivorous white male. I can just see it, I would make a classic
European dish, Abha would make a classic Indian dish, so you'd have both
ends of the spectrum, and then we'd put it together and see what came
out.''
Until the men with the cheque books find their way to Dalkeith,
Goldwyre and Rodriguez plan to teach small courses for keen dinner party
cooks. With his passion for good ingredients, unconventional techniques,
taste for Indian spices, added to all the tips he's gleaned from
professional chefs, Goldwyre reckons he has plenty of material.
''The idea is to have about a dozen in here, so they can actually feel
the heat. To me that really is so important. And there will be constant
tasting. I've been at food demos before and it's so frustrating, you
think what did they put into that, what kind of wine vinegar was it, how
strong, was it sweet . . .  until you actually taste these things you
just can't tell.'' He insists on using Scottish produce, which he
believes is the best in the world, but does his shopping in the
supermarket.
''I hate this attitude that you can only make a dish with a particular
ingredient from a little shop just outside Worcester.'' Apart from the
blow torch -- for caramelising tarte tatin, tanning peely-wally sponges,
puffing up omelettes -- he favours readily available equipment.
''I'm not a professional restaurateur, that takes a whole different
set of skills but I now know a lot about cooking. What I want to do is
be able to pass on what I've learned -- techniques, how to work out
flavours, combinations of flavours, preparation, certain ways to pull it
all together so that when you're having a dinner party, you don't have
what I call blotchy-neck syndrome.
''No one wants to prepare anything when they've got their glad rags
on,  you've got to know how to prepare it in advance. If you don't, you
finish up with soup, casserole, a pudding that's been sitting around for
10 hours, never something that's fast, flowing, quick, zappy, straight
out of the pan. I'm going to teach people to put that on the table
without getting sweaty palms''.
* Gerry Goldwyre and Abha Rodriguez's classes will start later this
year. For details contact 0131-660 4865.

NOTHING can match the delights of a water feature in your garden. The
glint of a fish, the gurgle and splash of a fountain, the hordes of
aquatic plants to place in and around the pool -- all combine to create
an invigorating, yet calming, corner in your garden which is impossible
to emulate.
Traditionally, however, ponds have been time-consuming and costly to
build, difficult to maintain, and prone to cracks and leaks. Until now,
that is.
Preformed polythene pools are the latest addition to the
constantly-growing list of accessories available from your garden
centre. Their main advantage are ease of installation, strength, and
resistance to puncture.
At around (40-60cm) deep, the best pools provide enough water to
protect fish from excessive heat or frost. A good pond should also
feature planting shelves about 20cms beneath the surface. These allow
marginal plants to blend into the water's edge.
Sizes and shapes are almost endless with a wide array of waterfalls,
rock cascades, falls, and fountains to personalise your own creation.
So how does the budding water gardener go about putting in a pond?
Actually, it's surprisingly simple, providing care is taken and it is
done in one or two vital stages.
Once a pool shape has been chosen and positioned in the garden, dig a
hole slighty bigger than, but following the pond outline. The base of
the hole must be covered with at least 5cm of sand to protect the pool
bottom from stones and help level the pool.
Now place the pond in the hole ensuring the top is kept completely
level -- this is vital to keep your pool full.
The space between the pool and the hole must now be filled with soil,
which should be carefully compacted. Fill the pool with water at the
same time, keeping the water level and soil level the same so that the
weight of the water stops the pool from moving as the soil is pushed
down. Make sure the plant shelves are also well supported.
It's important to check that the top stays absolutely level during
installation.
With the pool in and supported, it's best to leave things for around a
week to allow the soil to settle before decorating the edges, or
thinking about a fountain or waterfall -- for which you will need a
submersible pump.
Fortunately, they are easy to install and simple to operate.
Coming in a wide range of sizes to suit every garden pond, the pump is
sited above the bottom of the pond on bricks or other support. This
ensures silt cannot clog the strainer.
Next, connect the pump to a suitably earthed mains supply. Submersible
pumps must be wired with a waterproof cable connector or junction box,
or permanently connected to the fixed wiring of the house mains system.
An earth leakage circuit breaker must be used.
When laying the cable from the pond to the house, take care to hide
the flex in the stones and growth around the pool's edge.
The last step is to connect the pump to the fountain, cascade, or
waterfall. Use as short a length of hose as possible -- this helps to
reduce friction within the hose and maximise the jet of water. Garden
centre experts will advise on the appropriate diameter of hose for size
of pump.
Wildlife prefer pooled effort
THE choice of one, two, or three-stage fountains, with or without
ornamental features such as a frog, dolphin, or kingfisher, to add the
finishing touch is staggering. You might plump for a cascade, a
waterfall, or you may prefer the bell fountains where the water is
forced into a circular or bell-shaped jet.
Whatever you choose, the attraction is immediate but your pump and
fountain will also perform a second, environmentally-friendly function.
It circulates and aerates the water increasing oxygen levels, which will
benefit plants, fish, and other wildlife attracted to the pond. Fish
will play in the splashing water because the extra oxygen increases
their activity, especially on a hot summer's day when oxygen levels can
drop sharply.
Your pool and fountain now up and running, all that remains is to fill
and surround it with the fish and flowers of your choice. The choice is
as wide as the different shapes and hues on the garden plants and shrubs
-- with everything from broad-leaved water lilies, to truly aquatic
plants growing under the water -- good oxygenators, and floating plants
drifting on the surface.
Placing the marginal and bottom growing varieties in a planting crate
is a useful tip because it stops soil muddying the pond. It also allows
the owner to move them and control growth without the problem of digging
under the water. Specialist loamy soils and composts are available from
garden centres, and covering them with stones keeps the growing package
in place. For good flowering during the summer or when re-planting,
fertilise once a year.
It's a whole new world of gardening, and whether you want a small
decorative pond, or a stately fountain, the addition of the water of
life will never fail to provide a growing interest.

LOVERS of hand-thrown ceramics with a homely, honest feel will be
attracted to the plain, serviceable work of Robert Sanderson with its
rich dark brown glazes..
Edinburgh-born Robert studied ceramics in England and spent some time
in Australia, New Zealand, and Tanzania -- but it was a love of his
native land and the lifestyle he could enjoy here that drew him back.
Now well established at his Perthshire base, he has been enjoying the
luxury of a #10,000 bursary from the Scottish Arts Council to enable him
to develop new directions for his wood-fired pottery.
Robert's work has a timeless appeal. It is domestic pottery and very
much meant to be used, not just admired from afar, and he likes the idea
of utility and frequent handling. ''It's important to me that people
enjoy my work,'' he says.
There is nothing pretentious about it. The plain stoneware with its
rich dark brown glazes and strong, satisfying shapes is more influenced
by Japanese culture.
Clay bodies from Devon and Dorset are mixed with sand to a sloppy
soup-like consistency, then wrapped and allowed to mature for a year
while drying slowly.
Robert uses a kick-wheel for his throwing, a technique that allows him
maximum spontaneity. Like most creative people he feels very close to
the objects he creates and knows a good pot as soon as he has thrown it.
For this reason as much as any he prefers his work to be largely
undecorated.
''My pots are very quiet,'' he says. ''But I like to think they make
people smile. I think decoration detracts from the shape of the pot.''
All of Robert Sanderson's work is wood-fired -- once only -- in his
home-made kiln. Wood-firing is a complex and lengthy process that
demands careful stacking, not simply to reduce breakage but to maximise
the effect of the passage of the flame through the kiln. Many pieces are
glazed only on the inside, the effect on the outside being the result of
the light and shadow of the flame.
''The position of a pot in the kiln is crucial,'' explains Robert.
''It's like doing a three-dimensional jigsaw. The shape of the piece and
what it is standing beside is as important as the throwing of the
piece.''
It's a big investment in time and effort. Firing takes from 24 to 27
hours and the temperature rises to 1300[DEG]C, using around
one-and-a-half tons of wood. During firing, the kiln requires constant
attention.
''I have learned to understand flame as a creative medium,'' says
Robert. ''I have discovered that flame and heat have a controllable
effect on clay. Wood ash, given time and a high temperature, melts to
give a smooth, glassy surface. That fascinates me.''
A keen student of his subject, Robert has presented papers at a number
of international conferences on ceramics and has also written articles
jointly with his wife, Coll Minogue, also a potter. His work has been
exhibited in galleries around the world and he has been invited to the
Chelsea Crafts Fair and Art in Action in Oxford. You will also find him
from time to time at craft fairs around Scotland. If you would like to
visit him at his workshop, please phone ahead.
Robert sells everything from individual items to a complete dinner
service. Being effectively vitrified by the firing, they can withstand
the acidic soaps used in dishwashers and may be used with impunity in
oven, freezer, or microwave. You should not take them straight from the
freezer to the oven, however. Prices range from #8 for a small mug to
#12 for a bread plate and #18 for a dinner plate. A large teapot costs
#55 but a five-inch cereal bowl costs only #9.

Geraldine Abrahams meets an avid era-collector.
COLLECTING furniture and ornaments from different eras has become a
popular pastime in recent years, not least because it is the kind of
hobby in which everyone can participate. TV programmes like The Antiques
Road Show enjoy top ratings while a nostalgic mood sweeps the country
creating a yearning for things of the past.
But Gary Little was in there before most of us. He has been gathering
what he calls ''simple, stylish design'' from the 1930s and 1950s for
the past seven or eight years.
Gary's ''private collection' includes treasured art deco hand-painted
jugs and vases designed in the 1930s by Charlotte Rhead, a designer who
is growing in popularity although, as yet, she has not reached the
renown of Clarice Cliff.
''I love the bright colours in the vases,'' says Gary. ''They have a
style and a quality you don't get now.''
He also has some small tables from the 1930s, but his pieces de
resistance must be the exquisite French lamps from the latter part of
that period which were among the first items he bought. They generally
feature reclining ladies holding up large, circular light panels.
''I think they give a real feeling for the period in which they were
designed,'' he says. ''They reflect a time when everything was stylised
and people had a better life. They make you think of a time when Britain
appeared to be carefree, even if it wasn't.''
Gary's love for that time has not precluded collecting from other
eras. Fascinated by the American influences of the early 1950s, he has
various knick-knacks from then, including porthole-shaped bevelled
mirrors which line the bathroom walls.
He is not a professional collector. He buys things because he likes
them and suggests that in the 1990s finding what you are looking for is
becoming increasingly difficult.
''It's getting harder to collect now because in the eighties a lot of
people were getting into antique-collecting,'' he says. ''That pushed
prices up and has made things harder to get. At the same time, from
watching television programmes like the Road Show, people think --
wrongly -- that anything old must be valuable.''
He considers that there is no point in collecting seriously today
unless you have a source. For the more casual collector, he suggests it
is best to go with what you like. With a wider variety, it is necessary
to have much more knowledge.
The obvious sources are second-hand shops where it is still possible
to have lucky finds and, for quality, the auction houses when they are
featuring specialist periods.
Despite his advice to focus on a particular style or period, Gary has
been unable to resist some artefacts from other times, like the mother
of pearl table dating from 1880, the vases designed in 1910 and 1920,
and the 90-year-old wooden ventriloquist's dummy which took him five
years to find.
Pride of place is taken by a 1971 Norton motorbike, in pristine
condition, which recently took him to Spain without mishap.
''Collecting is a great hobby and it doesn't have to take a lot of of
time,'' he says. ''If you have an interest, you make the time.''

The creations of Jilli Blackwood (left) are now more accessible, notes
Kay Johnson.
THE luxurious layered and embroidered silk cushions made by Jilli
Blackwood, one of Glasgow School of Art's most innovative textile
graduates, have in a sense finally come home.
After years of exhibiting in such prestige venues as the Victoria and
Albert Museum, the CCA Gallery in Cambridge and even in Santa Fe, New
Mexico, Jilli's very tactile creations can now be purchased at Linda
Reid Plus, Giffnock.
Jilli, who specialised in embroidered and woven textiles at GSA, uses
a whole range of fabrics and techniques in her work. The workroom in her
home in Glasgow's West End, has a 16-shaft Harris loom and a Bernina
sewing machine -- both important to her work, though at the moment, the
Bernina has the edge.
''There was a time when I thought I would give up the weaving because
it is both expensive and time-consuming,'' she says, ''but I couldn't do
it. The weaving and the embroidery feed off each other.''
Using a range of rich jewel-coloured silks, she layers, machine
embroiders, frays and sometimes slashes or draws threads, in order to
produce wall-hangings, throws and cushions with strong textural
appearance. These techniques, together with her woven pieces (which in
the past have also included different fibres ranging from wool to
leather) have not only produced textiles useful for soft furnishings but
also for the fashion industry. She has undertaken numerous commissions
for lengths of fabric for designers in Britain (and in Germany) and has
herself made jackets and hats to order.
''I am very much a textile person whether you call it art or design,''
says Jilli. ''Textiles are very often the cow's tail in that people are
more apt to buy ceramics or jewellery. I feel it is my job to show how
innovative and wonderful textiles are.''
Her textiles have appeared in the Designer's Guild in London and also
featured in several books including Crafts (International) edited by
Martina Margetts. She has large works in private collections in the US
and Spain and also in museum collections, including the Glasgow Museum &amp;
Art Gallery, Kelvingrove. Her work will feature in a travelling
exhibition of Scottish Contemporary Textiles which opens in Galashiels
this summer.
Jilli's very distinctive style of work is part of the new emphasis on
design being promoted by Linda Reid Plus. Linda's first shop in Fenwick
Road concentrated on fabrics, bed linens and towels from all over the
world. When she moved to larger premises, with 9000 square feet, she was
able to present 24 different room settings. In addition to soft
furnishings, she now provides a complete range of ideas for the home
from carpets and flooring to furnishings, lighting, wallpapers,
ceramics, ornaments and objets d'art.
Linda, who visits degree shows at GSA and Edinburgh College of Art, to
look for new talent, also attends exhibitions and trade fairs throughout
Europe to select high-quality items.
''We can assist with the refurbishment of everything from offices and
hotels to kitchens and bathrooms,'' says Linda. ''This new store is a
dream come true. I've always wanted to show everything under one roof
and to be able constantly to change the stock and the room sets where
goods are displayed.''

* FLYING ducks? Don't give me flying ducks. They are supposed to
represent the nadir of wall-hung bad taste, but they are extremely
manageable. If your house goes on fire you just unclip them and run;
alternatively you just leave them to burn. They are no problem, because
there's never more than three of them.
Teddy Bears, though, are a different kind of house-aninal. They are
reckoned to be good taste. The unfortunate family in the Borders whose
house went on fire last week has hundreds of them. Firefighters and
neighbours formed a human chain to pass the bears hand-over-fist down
the stairs and outside to safety and 400 were rescued, some suffering
smoke inhalation.
You can sense some subtle double-standard here. If your house caught
fire and you shouted to the firepersons as they dashed in ''The ducks!
Save the ducks!'' then, somehow, I can't see any human chains being
formed. But there is one advantage; once the firepersons realised you
had flying ducks on the wall some sixth sense would tell them the fire
had been started by your chip pan.
These things are linked by what I, as a Disneyland Professor of Bad
Taste at the University of Camelon, would term ''lifestyle
stratification''.
I may have mentioned before that I have a friend who collects ceramic
frogs. To be honest, they tend to collect themselves these days,
spawning uncontrollably by parcel post and airmail. He thinks he has
around 300 but, not being an actuary by nature, he's not terribly sure.
They present a slight problem in that any stranger visiting his house
notices them immediately, falls silent and starts to look anxious. He
got rid of an insurance salesman that way without having to say a word.
''Vic,'' I asked him, ''what would you do if your house went on
fire?'' Pause. ''It's all right,'' I said reassuringly, ''I'm not
threatening you.''1
The answer was illuminating. He said he would save his photograph
collection first, his record collection second, and the frogs would have
to hop it on their own. This shows a man and a house-animal breeder who
modestly conceals his innate good taste under an outer show of the bad:
a splendid chap.
Now here's a true-life enigma. A friend going to college for three
years asks you to look after her budgie. You pass it on to your
mother-in-law, on the grounds that she already has one and a second
won't be too much bother. Unfortunately, your friend's budgie does a
carpet-landing and is pounced upon by your mother-in-law's youngest
son's cat, which she has also been left with while the son goes off to
discover himself.
The question: what do you tell the friend? She's been back from
college for a year now, and is starting to ask.

CASE HISTORY: The Rev Helen Percy could not rate Grace and Prudence
more highly. Not just because these qualities are in keeping with her
vocation -- she is Church of Scotland minister to six rural parishes --
but because they are her household pets.
Four-year-old Grace and two-year-old Prudence are Vietnamese
pot-bellied pigs. They present a familiar sight in Kilry, a five-house
hamlet at the foot of Glenisla, where they are occasionally to be found
in Helen's house but more usually have the run of her half-acre garden.
''There was a border,'' she explains apologetically, ''but they like
eating things you've just planted.''
The lawn looks distinctive too -- its craters are evidence of the
pigs' superior digging technique. It's a trick which caused problems
shortly after Helen Percy moved in. One day, the animals pushed their
snouts under the fence and escaped when she was out. But, maintains
Helen, the incident demonstrated a wonderful community spirit.
''The neighbours found a bucket with pig nuts in the shed, rounded
them up, shut the gate, then left a note for me on the kitchen table.''
Angus folk, says Helen warmly, are used to animals -- ''they know pigs
are clean and intelligent''. Unlike certain parishioners in her
previous, urban charge. Helen's new neighbours appreciate the important
facts of country life, such as that pig manure is very good for sweet
peas (Grace and Prudence do tend to eat the flowers, though).
But why does Helen like such unusual pets? ''I always wanted a pig --
or pigs. They're so ugly they're beautiful. It's like having toddlers;
they wind you up by pulling the cloth off the table or by disconnecting
the telephone. But they're intelligent enough to be funny.''
Her wish was granted when she adopted Grace from a farm where the pig
was was considered a nuisance; and Prudence joined the family more
recently after a friend decided to pass her on before moving house.
Grace and Prudence are popular with the local schoolchildren too.

WITHOUT argument the ''nicest'' practitioner in British politics, a
prince among men, a lord on the green leather benches of commoners, Lord
James-Douglas Hamilton, Minister of State at the Scottish Office, stoic
holder of a wafer-thin marginal seat and utterly loyal to the true blue
cause, is going to court to scupper his cousin.
At stake is a cool half-million pounds -- largesse of the late 10th
Earl of Selkirk, which Lord James wants to see in his 16-year-old son's
blazer pocket: a fortune which the cousin, Alasdair Malcolm
Douglas-Hamilton, a banker, believes should go to his account.
The bizarre convolutions of heraldry and inheritance -- as well as
possession of the half million quid -- will be hammered out in the
country's most arcane court, that of the Lord Lyon King of Arms, Sir
Malcolm Rognvald Innes of Edingight, Commander of the Royal Victorian
Order, Baron Yeochrie, Member of the Queen's Bodyguard for Scotland, and
Secretary to the Order of the Thistle.
At a date yet to be determined, but certainly not before September at
the earliest, Lord Lyon, in baroque attire aspired to by few Scottish
Office ministers or bank staff, will stride into court to hear claim and
counter claim, fearlessly prepared -- if he so determines -- to
overthrow an alleged ruling on the succession by his late father who, as
Lord Lyon, was asked to determine the matter long before the question of
the cash came up. He came down, it is claimed, in favour of the banker,
now girding his loins to fight for his arms.
It is the banker, Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, who has made the running
so far, having presented his petition to the Lyon office late last month
-- copies of which have yet to be successfully served on Lord James, his
brother the Duke of Hamilton, Scotland's premier peer, Lord James's
16-year-old son, and the Lord Advocate. The recent postal strike has
delayed the paperwork and the 21-day period for the lodging of answers
has yet to get under way. When due process has been gone through a date
will be set, sometime in the autumn legal term, for the
Douglas-Hamiltons' day in court.
Thus will the scene be set for a production that would be worthy of a
''house full'' notice if staged in Lothian Region's financially
challenged Festival Theatre . . . itself much in need of half a million
pounds. How has it all come about?
On Monday, November 28, last year, the House of Commons was, so to
speak, on the edge of its seat, poised to vote on the issue of Britain's
payments to the European Union and keenly aware that, for the
Government, it would be a close-run thing. As it was a confidence
debate, every Tory vote was vital.
But, as is so often the way when political parties stand on their
dignity and prepare to go to the wire, nature sticks out a leg to trip
them. Just four days before the big debate on Europe, Lord James's
uncle, George Douglas-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Selkirk, a former First
Lord of the Admiralty and childless, died, and the busy Scottish Office
Minister inherited the earldom -- on the face of it at any rate. The
next step, possibly, was a move to the House of Lords and a nail-biting
by-election for the Tories in Edinburgh West, where Lord James commands
a majority of just 879.
But what about the EU vote? With at least even chances of his becoming
an earl, Lord James would not be able to file through the Government
lobby in the Commons; would not even be allowed into the Chamber -- and
just when his vote could be crucial. Dismay in the Whips' office, a
tight timetable for salvation, family discussions far into the night at
Lord James's home in North Berwick. Should he or should he not?
Duty, the family decided, came first, and before there was time even
to take a tuck in the late Earl of Selkirk's ermine, Lord James saved
the day -- renounced his claim to the title, spared his party a hard
time in Edinburgh West and cast his vote to help the Government squeak
through with a slender majority. Gratitude was his reward as the Tory
party hailed him hero . . . splendid fellow, very decent thing to do,
selflessly loyal.
As he set off to lodge his Deed of Disclaimer at the Crown Office, his
uncle not yet buried, the four-day-earl himself put it thus: ''Having
discussed the matter with my family it is quite clear what I have to do.
I owe it as a duty to my constituents, whom I wish to continue to serve,
and as a matter of loyalty to the Prime Minister and to the Conservative
Party, to support John Major in the voting lobby.'' Unswerving duty to
the boy from Brick Lane at no small cost to himself. Noblesse oblige.
Unable now to enjoy the peerage, Lord James could console himself with
the fact that, on his death, it would pass to his son, John Andrew.
During the lacuna that had now fallen on the North Berwick branch of the
Douglas-Hamilton family, Lord James's cousin, named as heir-apparent to
the earldom in Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, likewise in Debrett,
would enjoy the title and keep the family name forward in the Upper
House; or so it seemed.
Then came the reading of the will. To renounce in haste can be to
repent at leisure. Distributing his bounty, the late 10th Earl laid it
down that whomsoever succeeded him would get a sum of #500,000, as well
as family portraits and, as Henry Clark, the 10th Earl's executor, puts
it, ''a few other items''. Tabards and tricorn hats were immediately
brushed and sponged in the elegant offices of the Lord Lyon in
anticipation of action to come.
It was not long in coming. Lord James instructed counsel to stake a
claim on behalf of his son, retaining Sir Crispin Agnew of Lochnaw, Bt,
to fight his corner before the Scottish College of Heralds -- an arena
in which Sir Crispin should feel at home, being Rothesay Herald in the
Court of the Lord Lyon.
The cousin who also claims -- Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton -- a
specialist in trustee work for the Bank of Scotland and known as the
Master of Selkirk, although he makes his home in St Boswells, has
appointed John Murray, QC, the former Lord Dervaird, as his second for
the duel before Lord Lyon, determined to fight for the title, the cash,
family portraits, and the ''few other items''.
Mr Douglas-Hamilton says he always expected to inherit, and claims to
hold the clincher in the battle ahead, already locked up in his lawyer's
office safe -- ''a letter from a previous Lord Lyon stating in
reasonably clear terms that I would succeed when my uncle died''.
Notwithstanding the court battle ahead, relations with his cousin James
are, he says, ''fine''.
If the letter now in close custody sets anything out in reasonably
clear terms it will shine like a beacon over the murky waters of an
action where heraldry, stripped of its finery, will appear to the
un-enobled public to be the practice of muddle, confusion, and
obfuscation.
Lord James's renunciation of his claim to the title may have saved the
day for John Major and established him in the public mind as
heir-apparent-historic, but the core question which Lyon Court will have
to resolve is just this: was the title his to renounce? Should it not be
Alasdair, the old pretender -- James's senior by a very few years -- who
is installed in the Lords?
Avoiding a single word which might hint at prejudging the issue, Lord
Lyon has been at pains to explain to all who ask, how the
Douglas-Hamilton double whammy has come about. Rules governing the
succession to the earldom, bestowed in 1646 by Charles I upon his cousin
Lord William Douglas, younger brother of the 1st Duke of Hamilton, are,
says Lyon, ''extremely complex''. Further, they are written in Latin.
Their thrust, explains Lyon, was to ensure as far as possible that the
titles of the Dukedom of Hamilton and the Earldom of Selkirk stayed
apart -- requiring that the Selkirk title would pass to the younger
brothers of successive dukes.
Late last century however, nothwithstanding the original arrangements,
the earldom and dukedom were merged and when, in 1940, the 13th Duke
died, the 14th Duke's younger brother, George, became the 10th Earl. He
it was who died inconveniently last November, leading Lord James,
immediate younger brother of the present and 15th Duke, to make his
disclaimer. Clear so far? Possibly not for long.
Step forward and be recognised, Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, cousin of
James and contender for the prize whose father, a former Tory MP, was
the younger brother -- after George -- of the 14th Duke. Alasdair's
father died in 1962; the 14th Duke in 1973. Had Malcolm survived, George
Malcolm could have been expected to inherit the earldom.
What Lyon is certain about is that when it comes to heraldry --
half-a-million-pound fortunes regardless -- there can be no quick fix.
''You cannot hatch it up. The parties have to prove it,'' he says. Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton, a boxing blue, is ready in his corner. Mr
Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, in his, is prepared to give a banker's
account of himself. Seconds out -- may the best man win, to the victor
the spoils.

''THE peacocks have been resident much longer than we have,'' says
Margaret Williams, ''but we quickly discovered that, as well as looking
beautiful, they are real characters too.''
No-one keeps animals for purely decorative reasons but, as a bonus,
some species are undeniably more attractive than others and can add a
certain something to any room. But not many extra interior touches are
called for when home is a gracious B-listed country house designed by
Robert Adam.
Margaret and Fred Williams bought their magnificent 10-bedroomed house
hotel (which also has nine self-catering cottages) in Skelmorlie five
years ago. Built in 1840, the sandstone house with its galleried landing
and cupola reminiscent of Culzean Castle.
The building is set in 15 acres of impeccable landscaped gardens with
spectacular views over the Firth of Clyde to Arran, Kintyre and Argyll.
But where the Williams family may rule the roost inside the house, the
acres outside are very much the domain of 12 strutting peacocks whose
male splendour provides the final decorative touch to the garden's
exotic and abundant shrubs, palm trees and conifers.
The grounds of Manor Park are strictly for the birds, as they see it.
''They don't move an inch for cars and if you hoot your horn they
disdainfully return the hoot and stay put,'' says Margaret.
Peacocks are also creatures of habit. ''Each winter they come up to
the house and stand with their feathers outstretched, over the kitchen
grating to enjoy the heat from the ovens,'' she adds. ''And they can be
very habitual about food too. We used to wonder why they immediately
descend from all directions as soon as the bin lorry appears. The noise
is deafening as they chase the lorry up the driveway. This is because
the binmen always share their packed lunches with them! Heaven help us
if they ever arrive empty-handed!''
The peacocks lay their eggs in the long grass of the walled garden and
Margaret has sometimes known a mother to bring her chick right up to the
front door in winter, as if to say ''it's your turn to feed the baby''.
''Although we give them bread every day, they are largely
self-sufficient from the fruits of the garden and really only need us
for food in the winter.''
Peacocks are beautiful birds that clearly add an extra dimension to a
garden. But maybe not to suburban gardens. ''Yes they are decorative,''
says Margaret, ''but they are also messy, eat the plants and are
incredibly noisy, with a raucous call that can start at dawn. And
although they don't fly as such, they can reach up to the roof, or over
a fence.
''I don't think that keeping two peacocks in a semi-detached garden
would be good for neighbourly relations.''
This suddenly makes garden gnomes seem an attractive alternative. They
may not look as pretty, but they don't wake you at dawn.

The so-cool cats
CASE HISTORY: Neighbours call them ''the snobs'' as they sit haughtily
in the bay window at nurse Angie Wallace's home in Langside. But looking
elegantly ornamental is not easy for Daisy and Harley (as in Harley
Davidson because he purrs loudly) and Avia (after the sports shoes, as
Angie teaches aerobics). ''They love their nightly hairbrushing,'' says
Angie, ''but we have a weekly dematting session with a steel comb --
which is different matter. And neither are they wild about the daily
cleanse, tone and moisturise routine to keep their faces clean.''
They're home-lovers too. ''They get into the garden occasionally but are
not at all street-wise.''

FISH make undemanding pets. They add a welcome splash of colour to the
living room and ask nothing more than a daily pinch of food in return.
You don't have to them for walks, chase them off the suite, or take them
to the vet's for injections. They don't bark at the postman or have to
be searched for fleas. Neighbours don't complain about them fouling the
path. There's a lot to be said for fish.
I have one of those small, four-gallon aquaria designed for tropical
fish that like to swim round in circles. Which is just as well really. I
have some neon tetras, some zebras, guppies and a catfish, none of them
more than 2cm long.
When I want to show off I call them my paracheirodon innesi, my
brachydanio rerio, my poecilia reticulatas and my corydoras but this is
utter pretentiousness as they cost less than #1 (or libra nova). They do
the job, though, darting here and there without bumping into each other,
coming to the surface for food, obligingly swimming through the
decorative arch at the bottom of the tank, and giving the impression of
having too much to do and too little time.
Moving colour, in other words, and all you have to do is keep the
water temperature at about 25-28 deg C, make sure it is clean and
filtered, and be on the alert for algae. The heating and filtration
equipment you buy with the tank more or less takes care of that for you,
but you have to replace a certain amount of the water on a regular
basis, with the occasional need for a full-scale clean-out.
This latter exercise is a demanding and exhausting experience for both
myself and my fish, and I have had many a reproachful look from a
paracheirodon innesi in the course of one. When combined with an equally
fishy stare from one's uxor irata (displeased wife) over the inevitable
spillage, it adds up to a daunting time for the aquarist.
Talking about the uxor, she is on dodgy ground when complaining about
an aquarium spilling water, as it was in this case the uxor that gave it
to the vir.
To survive this trauma, fish should be healthy. It's advisable to buy
your livestock from reputable local dealers, of whom there are many and
who come in all shapes and sizes, rather like the fish.
The names of such specialists as The Aquarium in Glasgow's Chisholm
Street, and the Olympia Pet Centre in East Kilbride, spring to mind. You
can buy an aquarium like mine for about #80 including heater,
thermostat, lighting and filtration equipment, gravel and a plant.
Larger tanks can cost several hundred pounds and can be supplied in
various sizes and shapes of cabinets to fit in with your room and decor.
The fish themselves can cost as little as 65p and as much as #70 or #80
for the more exotic species. Your aquarium should be situated in part of
the room which does not get direct sunlight.
Coloured gravel and ornaments help create a pleasing effect. A wide
variety of plants is available which have three functions: they provide
cover in which fish can hide, they help oxygenate the water, and they
look good.
All in all, aquaria can be colourful yet restful additions to the
family home, especially if you remember to feed the inhabitants, thus
avoiding the unpleasant sight of former fish floating at the top.

JAMES TASSIE was born on July 15, 1735, in the village of Pollokshaws
and grew up at a time when the Clyde valley, and Glasgow in particular,
was beginning a period of unprecedented prosperity.
He was trained at Robert and Andrew Foulis's art school, sited in
Glasgow College where, besides learning a specialist craft, he was given
a rounded artistic education. The Foulis Academy provided scholarships
for its pupils and in 1763, possibly supported by the academy, Tassie
left Glasgow for Dublin, a centre of the jewellery trade.
There he worked as assistant to Dr Henry Quin, the Professor of
Physics in the city's School of Physics and learnt from him the art of
manufacturing imitations of antique cameos and intaglios, a skill which
Dr Quin had been practising in Dublin with great success.
After three years in Dublin, Tassie moved on to London where he lived
for the rest of his life. He seems to have been successful from the
start. As a maker of portrait medallions, his work was unrivalled. The
formula of the vitreous paste used by Tassie, which he and Dr Quin had
invented in Ireland, was kept a secret from his competitors. Tassie
would model his portrait from the life if possible, though he did work
from other artist's portraits. He used red wax and two or three
modelling tools. Sittings took only two-and-a-half hours. Tassie's
earliest portraits were head and shoulders, which were then mounted on
an oval glass, backed by coloured paper. As Tassie's skill increased, he
learnt to cast the whole medallion in vitreous paste, so that the head
and body were of the same material as the background.
Like many London-based Scottish artists, a high proportion of Tassie's
sitters were Scots, and if they could not come to him he was prepared to
go to them. A notice in the Glasgow Courier on September 20, 1791,
announced: ''Mr Tassie of Leicesterfields, London, and Dr D Allan, of
Edinburgh, have been for some days here, upon a visit to their friends.
The excellence of these Artists in modelling from life, and in painting
with truth and character, has been for many years known and acknowledged
over Europe, and does honour to this part of the country where they
received their birth and earliest education.''
If Tassie's portrait medallions are what he is best known for today,
and he made some 500 during his lifetime, it was his reproductions of
antique gems which secured him international fame. In 1781, his name
came to the attention of Catherine the Great of Russia. Tassie's bill
for Catherine's commission still survives and it shows that the Russian
order was a financial coup as well as a professional triumph. He was
paid #2310 for the entire order.
Tassie's work became widely known through another channel --
publication. In 1791 an elaborate, scholarly, and handsome two-volume
work was printed. To illustrate it, Tassie called upon the skill of his
old friend, David Allan, recently appointed master of Edinburgh's
Trustees' Academy. To Allan and his design students, James Tassie's
career must have seemed exemplary and inspiring. A boy of modest
background, trained like themselves at art school in Scotland, who by an
intelligent application of science to art perfected his medium to rise
above his competitors and become a leader in his field. His association
with fellow craftsmen improved the quality of their products while
making a fortune for himself. He was, above all, a professional.

THE kudu screamed as it died, going down under the weight of five
lions. The kill was the climax of a hunt through the warm African night.
And as the lions had hunted, we had stalked them, safe but feeling
exposed and vulnerable in an open-topped Land Rover.
First the big cats disappeared into the undergrowth. Then there was a
rustling in the darkness as a herd of kudu, spooked but not yet
panicked, blundered into the silent pride.
Suddenly the bush was boiling lions and the antelope was down.
We watched them eating just 10ft away. They ignored us, concentrating
on their feeding frenzy. Everything was eaten and when they had done
only a bloody smear was left on the grass. The lions would spend another
half hour licking the blood from each other's faces.
The cold fury of the kill and its speed left us trembling, and
breathless, and unsure what exactly we were feeling -- a strange mixture
of exhilaration from the adrenalin buzz and guilt that we should feel so
excited at being voyeurs at the passing of a law of nature.
This was Mala Mala, one of South Africa's most exclusive private game
reserves and one of the few where, if you can afford it, you are almost
certain to see the big five -- elephant, leopard, rhino, Cape buffalo,
and, of course, the king of the veldt. Mala Mala, a tribal name for the
sable antelope, is on the border of the huge Kruger National Park, about
an hour and a half flight from Johannesburg.
Earlier we had seen a massively maned male patrolling his territory
and from fewer than 20ft away been shocked and scared by the lion's roar
-- a primitive, evil, deep-bass rumble that echoes hollowly inside your
chest, and makes the short hairs on the nape of your neck spring up.
The lion treated us with huge indifference, almost as if we were
invisible although we were aboard a vehicle reeking of hot oil and
excited humanity and using a powerful flashlight to slice through the
darkness.
Chris Daphne, head ranger at Mala Mala, explained that the animals,
both predator and prey, had become accustomed to the vehicles and had
over the years decided we were neither a threat nor food. They had filed
us away in some portion of their brain as an irrelevance.
Certainly the leopard we had seen the previous evening at sunset,
before the tropical storm, treated us with lofty disdain.
She had killed a duiker, a small antelope, and was dragging the
carcass into the high branches of a jackalberry tree above a dry
watercourse. Beneath the tree and close enough to hear the cat's jaws
crunching on the bones were three Mala Mala Land Rovers, spotlights
blazing and cameras clicking. One bound by the magnificent beast and she
could have been in the vehicles with us.
Eventually the leopard abandoned her kill and washed herself like a
huge domestic cat, her golden coat reflecting in the spotlights, her
eyes flashing with disdain as she stared at us. After around 20 minutes
she snaked head-first down the tree and into the deep bush.
''Ah, that was a really good sighting,'' sighed Chris, as exultant as
the rest of us.
As we had been watching the leopard the evening sky was darkening
ominously with thick cloud obscuring the half moon.
With awsome suddenness jagged lightning crackled across the sky. There
was no thunder. Then came the rain, lightly at first causing everyone to
struggle into wet-weather gear just in time to huddle against a
downpour.
Earlier we had seen elephants dusting themselves down with vast
quantities of dirt sprayed from their trunks.
One approached the Land Rover. He was huge and had only one tusk --
the other had been broken in a fight. Although he was about 15ft away he
seemed to loom over the vehicle, his enormous ears spread wide
intimidating us.
''They don't charge, hardly at all,'' said Chris. I didn't believe
him, especially when disturbed by the whine of a camera motor drive he
lumbered even closer. The Land Rover backed away and he settled back to
giving himself a dust shower, scooping up shovelfuls of the red African
earth and spraying it over his back.
The rhino was only a youngster -- just about the size of a delivery
van -- and a lion had attacked him leaving raw slashes along his
hindquarters.
Oxpecker birds were perched on him excavating parasites from his
wrinkled hide and feeding on the blood that still oozed from the wounds.
''The birds keep the wound from infecting but they also keep it open.
It's going to take a long time to heal,'' said Chris.
Cape buffalo, dozens of them, surrounded the vehicle as placid as
domestic cattle. It was hard to believe that buffalo are among the most
dangerous and feared of all the African animals, with a well-deserved
reputation as man killers.
Most dangerous of all are the old solitary bulls who, supplanted in
the herd by younger, fitter animals wander off in a massive huff. They
take out their vile temper on the world and will charge practically
without warning.
They called Mala Mala a camp. No Boy Scout ever lived like this. We
stayed in rondavels, circular buildings with tall, thatched roofs,
complete with air-conditioning.
We ate in the boma, a circular enclosure under the stars sitting in a
ring around a blazing camp fire, drinking fine South African wine and
telling tall tales. Ah, the simple life, any millionaire can have it.
At around #335 a night for the main camp, it does attract the rich and
famous, like Elton John, Joan Collins, and even Lady Thatcher, who
visited with former South African President F W de Klerk.
Within the game reserve, established in the 1930s there are two other
camps. Kirkman's costs around #235 and Harry's is the least expensive at
around #150.
The bush came as a complete culture shock. We had spent the previous
night at the gloriously vulgar and totally over-the-top Palace of the
Lost City in Sun City, southern Africa's answer to Las Vegas. The
architecture, with stone kudu leaping from the central tower, is
unashamedly brash. The interior misses no opportunity to scream
overstuffed opulence. Yet, in a crazy way, it works.
Sun City, a two-hour drive from Johannesburg, is the creation of
American multimillionaire Sol Kerzner and, in the bad old days of
apartheid and narrow Calvinism, Sun City was where South Africans came
to avoid South Africa's strict morality laws and gamble, because the
entertainment complex was actually in one of the so-called independent
homelands, Bophuthatswana.
Jean Mestriner, general manager of the Palace of the Lost City, admits
it is more showbiz than homely.
''What we try to do,'' he said, ''has much in common with theatre;
it's an art form. We strive to make each day a memorable performance
from a cast that includes chefs, bellhops, waiters, and housekeepers.''
The storyline for this epic production depends on a legend -- a myth
of Africa involving a nomadic tribe which built a fabulous city in the
depths of the jungle and lived in harmony and luxury until an earthquake
struck. The survivors fled, never to return and the city slumbered in
the African heat until it was rediscovered and rebuilt.
Nice myth, but the Palace was built from scratch in just 19 months.
The developers grew a jungle in the desert.
They created a tropical beach where artificial waves pound the white
sands. There are two golf courses, one of which hosts the annual Sun
City million-dollar challenge. The thirteenth hole has real crocodiles
in the water hazard.
There is a spirit of optimism in the land, especially since the
elections just over a year ago passed off relatively peacefully, despite
fears of a bloodbath.
That optimism is reflected in tourism bookings. The forthcoming Rugby
World Cup will boost tourism even more and will be a stiff test of the
country's infrastructure.
Even so, Africa is now one of the world's most exciting destinations.
South African Airways flights from London are running at better than 90%
capacity and hotel bookings are well up.
SAA has eight black pilots under training. They admit it's just a
start.
Liz McGrath, the dynamic owner of the Cellars Hohenort country house
hotel at Constantia outside Cape Town, said: ''We were really worried
before the elections but since then bookings have taken off.''
Her decision to buy the former farmhouse and vineyard and convert it
into a five-star hotel was not just a gamble, it was a statement of
faith in the future of the country. It appears her optimism has been
justified.
A few days before I arrived, many of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh's
entourage stayed at the Cellars -- the guest book bulged with Buckingham
Palace addresses.
The decision by the Queen to present Nelson Mandela with the Order of
Merit mirrored the respect in which the President is held by almost all
sections of South African opinion. He rose higher, particularly in white
opinion, by refusing to show bitterness despite his years of
imprisonment. He even invited his jailer to his presidential
inauguration.
But, just a 20-minute drive away from the Cellars hotel, set in a
beautiful wooded hillside is the embodiment of one of the most serious
problems he faces -- the Crossroads squatter camp.
More than a million blacks live in corrugated-iron squalor on the
doorstep of Cape Town airport. Even there tourists can go, but only with
a proper guide. One company offers minibus tours of the townships
claiming that the squatters are keen to let the outside world know of
their living conditions.
The shanty towns cannot hide the splendour of Cape Town -- one of the
world's most beautiful cities. It is dominated by Table Mountain and by
taking a short trip from the city you can bathe in two oceans -- the
Atlantic and the Indian on the same day.
Beaches are beautiful white sand and we saw dolphins just offshore.
Take the cable car up Table Mountain for the best views, if the day is
clear, but all too often the mountain wears its tablecloth of cloud. At
the top there is a restaurant, cafe, and souvenir shop.
In Cape Town itself we stayed in the Mount Nelson Hotel -- a pink
confection originally built by the Union Castle shipping line to house
their VIP guests out from England. It is very colonial, full of chintz
furnishings and heavy leather. An establishment of solid comfort now run
by Orient-Express Hotels.
People in Cape Town are proud of their latest shopping and leisure
development -- the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront. Note the Alfred, not
Albert, since the docks the development is based on were named for the
late queen and her son Alfred, not her husband. Alfred inaugurated the
docks in the last century.
In common with other dockland sites the area fell into disrepair.
(Just think of Glasgow.) Massive investment, however, turned it into one
of Africa's most fashionable shopping and entertainment experiences.
Every night it swings into the small hours with jazz and rock music.
The atmosphere reminded me of the Glasgow Garden Festival although Cape
Town's waterfront is a permanent attraction.
Out of town are the farms and vineyards growing grapes that are making
South African wines world famous. Many offer wine tastings in the hope
that you will be tempted to buy a few bottles.
Rumour has it that while South Africa was still the forbidden country
many of those fine Chilean wines being praised by experts actually
started life off on the eastern side of the Atlantic. Shipped in bulk
from South Africa they were bottled and labelled in Chile and sold as
South American produce.
There is no need for subterfuge now. The pound is strong against the
rand and South Africa is reckoned in the travel trade as the next big
thing. It has the infrastructure already. It has great beauty and a
variety of cultures -- there are now around 17 official languages -- and
a need for investment and foreign exchange.
How good it is to be able to go there, not just with a clear
conscience, but knowing you are experiencing the early days of a new
nation.

Creatures which have spent their lives in captivity are helping work
to conserve species which are under threat in the wild, reports Anthony
Armstrong.
London Zoo's celebrity lion, Arfur, has headed north to a final
resting place in Edinburgh. The animal which gave so much pleasure to
adults and children while he was alive is now scheduled to continue in
the public eye as a stuffed exhibit in the Royal Museums of Scotland's
wild cat section.
He will be in good company. Unknown to most members of the public who
file through the exhibition halls, a joint operation between the Royal
Museums and Edinburgh University has created a research programme using
animals, birds, and reptiles donated by zoos and collections all over
Britain.
Creatures which have spent all their lives in captivity are playing a
vital role after death in work to conserve species which are under
threat in the wild.
''We use animals and birds from a lot of well known zoos. They have
all died naturally -- nothing is killed for us,'' says Dr Andrew
Kitchener, curator of mammals and birds at the Royal Museums.
''Some species like snow leopards and clouded leopards are the subject
of international breeding programmes. Because they are so rare we often
know very little about them. The research we can do on specimens that
have died in captivity can make an invaluable contribution to their
survival in their natural environment.''
The Royal Museum's team tend to use a first donated specimen to be
mounted for display. Subsequent examples of the species are kept for
research and the organs and bones are stored.
Dr Kitchener says: ''When an animal is stuffed the skin is mounted on
a foam or fibreglass shape cast from the carcass, which gives accurate
muscle definition.
''We are not sure yet exactly what is going to happen to Arfur. His
skin is actually being tanned at this moment. We would like to stuff him
but, because he was ill before he died, part of his skin was shaved to
make it easier for the vet to inject him. Just how this will show up
could be a problem and we might have to be selective about what pose he
is in. We try to choose poses that replicate an animal's behaviour in
the wild.''
There has been no problem with a huge brown bear called Bruce who was
for years a star attraction at the Highland Wildlife Park in Kingussie.
Bruce is about to take the stage at the Royal Museums in his newly
immortal stuffed form and will eventually feature in a history of
Scottish wildlife exhibition in the new Museum of Scotland being built
in Chambers Street, Edinburgh. Bruce actually came from Romania but is
the type of bear which last roamed wild in Scotland 1000 years ago.
Some specimens travel. The skeleton of an extremely rare Madagascar
Teal which originally came to Edinburgh from Jersey Zoo is currently on
loan to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and the
Edinburgh team is in touch with scientists all over the world. Edinburgh
Zoo, close at hand, is one of the museum's key sources.
A spokesman said: ''More or less every mammal or bird that dies is
offered. The biggest recently was a female giraffe that had to be put
down because she had an inoperable leg condition. We have kept her head
and neck here but the Royal Museums have the rest of the skeleton for
teaching purposes.''
For those wondering how the experts go about such a king-sized job,
the zoo reveals this trade secret. The skeleton is boiled after
dissection using a well-known brand of domestic washing powder. The
spokesman said: ''I don't know what it does to clothes but the bones
come out beautifully clean and white.''

They're pretty, they're fun and (generally speaking) worth buying the
equipment for. But while animals might enhance your life, home and
garden, caring for them and sharing with them is not always easy. Decor
they ain't.
We're beginning to understand, animal psychologist Valerie O'Farrell
tells WENDY JACK.
TIME was when few people would admit to having a problem pet. While
family and friends could see Fido was creating difficulties, puce-faced
owners dismissed appalling behaviour with lame excuses like ''highly
strung'' or ''highly pedigreed''.
But the past decade has seen big changes, believes veterinary clinical
psychologist Dr Valerie O'Farrell who works at the Dick Vet School in
Edinburgh. ''People now realise that something can be done,'' she says.
''It's percolated into public consciousness that this sort of thing has
come into the veterinary curriculum. In the past people either kept
quiet or thought vets would only suggest euthanasia, or give vague,
useless advice like 'pull yourself together and be firm with the dog'.''
It's easy to pin the blame for apparently neurotic domestic pets on
the fact that so many people now go out to work, isolating them.
However, Dr O'Farrell says there is no statistical evidence of this.
''Certainly, more people don't see it as essential to give cats access
to the outdoors.
''In theory, you can create an acceptable home environment. If they've
never been allowed out, have plenty of toys, enough interest and other
cats to play with, it can be all right. It's not on, though, for people
just to go out to work and leave a cat with nothing to do or hunt. I've
seen problems arising from bored cats shut in flats, spraying or running
after people to hunt them instead of prey.''
And dogs? ''They are pack animals and can have all sorts of problems
if people go out and leave them alone. A dog will sleep naturally for
four hours during the day. If people work part-time, most dogs will
resign themselves to that. If left alone all day, however, they'll be
awake part of that time -- and bored. They'll seek company and not find
it.''
Many problems which find their way to Dr O'Farrell are
frustration-related, often caused by loneliness. ''Some destructiveness
in the owner's absence have a purpose in that it may be directed at the
door the owner left by,'' she explains. ''Some of it's just nervous
tension like destroying wallpaper or a sofa -- an outlet for
frustration.
Looking at our own lifestyles, then, may help in understanding some
apparently bizarre behaviour in our pets. A dog left alone, which
doesn't necessarily display distress, may come to regard itself as the
leader of a pack. ''A dominant-type dog may get more dominant over the
owner at home. I've seen cases of owners trying to get into the kitchen
and the dog growling, saying 'no, you can't come in here, this is my
territory'.''
Encouraging owners to act more dominantly when they're at home help
deal with this. ''The thing is to keep in mind what effect lifestyle
changes will have on the dog. It's easy to get them accustomed to
anything if they know what to expect, but they do need company. I don't
think it's on for someone to contemplate a dog if they're going to be
working full-time. They'll be stacking up problems.''
Sometimes, apparently, neither owner nor dog is at fault when
difficulties arise. ''There can be simply a mismatch between the two,''
explains Dr O'Farrell. ''Someone looking for a child substitute can't
treat a dominant dog like that, because every time it wants something
and gets it, it's taken as confirmation that it's dominating the
household and can take more. It's not necessarily that you've done
anything wrong, just that this particular dog has to be handled
differently.''
How do you choose a dog or cat that's right for you and your family?
Temperament is the most important factor, believes Dr O'Farrell. ''Some
breeders are not as careful as they might be in producing animals in
relation to temperament, though others are now being very responsible in
this way.''
People looking for a dog which will depend on them and be good company
should go for a spaniel type, whereas those seeking an animal which
won't need them so much might choose a terrier, she suggests.
She advises meeting a puppy's mother, and if either of them is timid
or aggressive, resist the emotional pull. Make sure too that the pup has
been brought up in the house, not in a breeder's run outside. ''One of
the things that will spoil a puppy for life is not having been exposed
to domestic sights and sounds during what's called the socialisation
period, that's up to 12 weeks. Cats even more so -- that's up to seven
weeks.''
If you're rescuing a dog or cat from a shelter, be aware that you may
be taking on problems, she urges.
''For some good souls, there is extra pleasure in rehabilitating a
problem, just as there are foster parents who get extra satisfaction
from taking on problem children. Some, however, take such animals
because they don't want to spend much -- but what you pay for a dog is
peanuts compared with what you are going to pay for it throughout its
life, in food, vet's fees and so on. Think carefully.''
* Dr Farrell is the author of Dogs' Best Friend and Problem Dogs, both
published by Methuen.
His own little canaryisland
CASE HISTORY: ''I was brought up with birds in our nursery. They flew
free and made their nests in the curtains. The terrible thing was, we
couldn't pull the curtains. If somebody did move them, the nests fell
down.''
Not surprisingly, with such vivid childhood memories, octogenarian
society photographer Brodrick Haldane still keeps birds in his Edinburgh
flat, colourfully fluttering around in their double cage in a room where
dozens of his photographs of the rich and famous gaze down from the
walls.
If they sat still for long enough to be counted, they would probably
number 14 or so . . . canaries and finches but none of the more exotic
species in which he has delighted in the past. ''Now they've stopped the
permit for certain birds being imported, which means you can't get the
exciting ones I used to have. They're not terribly strong, of course.
What's strange is that when one dies, another dies.
''I have some affinity with birds,'' he muses, ''I love them, I love
watching them. When a bird dies, I'm in a terrible state.''
Are they difficult to keep? ''A lot of trouble, and they make a
frightful mess. The seed is everywhere, even when they're caged. They
are not flying free just now, but it still gets everywhere, all over the
floor.''
Not all his visitors have admired his beloved birds: ''Sometimes I've
had people here who didn't like them, especially women. Sitting here one
day, one of the birds flew in and this woman ducked her head and got in
a terrible state.
''A friend and I bought the biggest cage we could get -- I didn't like
the idea of them having to be locked up all the time -- then he added
another cage to the end. He was in the process of making the most
enormous cage, it was going to be so big, just terrific, but suddenly he
had to go away. It's never been done. Such a pity.''
Prettier than that picture
CASE HISTORY: When Elizabeth Miller retired from British Gas nine
years ago, she considered choosing a #600 painting as a retirement gift.
But she chose Orville instead, a white Goffin cockatoo, only marginally
less expensive.
This did not surprise Elizabeth's colleagues -- she already had
Smokey, an African grey parrot with a magnificent red tail, as well as a
blue-fronted Amazon, plus Sacha,the papillon dog. And that was just
inside her detached home in a village south of Glasgow. Outside there
was an aviary, now home to three pairs of cockateils, and a fish pond.
And Elizabeth has since added a few more residents; Orville; Silky,
another papillon; two firecrest salamanders and an anole (American
chameleon).
Smokey and Orville fly freely around the house much of the time but,
while they look decorative, Elizabeth admits they are a handful.
Both birds also talk -- so realistically that a guest in the house
once thought he was being propositioned in the night when Smokey
seductively murmured ''Hello darling!''
''They can be destructive if they are not supervised,'' says
Elizabeth. ''Pot plants get stripped or toppled and their beaks are very
sharp, as much of my furniture can testify. But they're much prettier
than paintings.''

If you have an instinct that drives you towards Lemmings, you have a
big future in the computer games world. Jennifer Cunningham relates one
Scottish success story.
TALL, slim, pale, bespectacled and bejeaned (brown not blue), David
Jones appears the archetypal boffin. He's the boy next door who used to
spend hours inventing computer games in his bedroom and grew up to be a
millionaire.
Now when the Japanese techno-giant Nintendo wants someone to design a
game which will give their next step into technology world success, they
call David in Dundee. DMA Design is one of only two companies
commissioned to create for Nintendo's new Ultra 64 system. The other is
a similarly small company with a big reputation in Leicestershire. DMA
-- direct memory access -- is a computing term synonymous with high
speed and high technology, which makes it instantly memorable in this
particular world.
DMA has just joined forces with BMG. The Bertelsmann Music Group,
although the world's second-largest entertainment company -- behind Time
Warner --are less-known than their component companies such as the RCA
record label. They have announced a strategic partnership with DMA to
publish four new game titles for the IBM PC and the next generation of
game platforms.
''They are a huge company of music publishers and video publishers and
have now set up a division purely to handle games. What is good about
them is that they have said they will treat computer companies in the
same way that they treat their music companies. In other words, BMG take
a back seat. In the past we have sold our games to publishers and unlike
the book business it is the publisher's name which is pushed rather than
the author's. That is because it really was a sort of bedroom-type
activity -- a hobby market -- and we really could not do much. That is
changing now: developers are getting more clout, because it is the
quality of the games that determines if they sell. The market is
becoming very professional now,'' said Jones.
He is determined that his company will remain in Dundee where he was
born 29 years ago, but for practical as well as sentimental reasons. The
son of a Yorkshire father and Highland mother, he combines creativity
with canniness. His wife, Pamela, is a Dundee girl from an Italian
family. Their 18-month-old son has already been lined up by dad as one
of the company's envied ''playtesters''.
''Most of our staff are Scots. It is a definite policy of ours that we
recruit people who are Scottish and want to stay in Scotland and then it
is a big upheaval to move down south. Because we work on a project for
12-15 months, staff become a key part of it and we don't want to lose
them.
''None of the computer courses really produce the kind of people we
need, so we have to train them up for a year, but we are talking to
Abertay, the new university in Dundee who supply about 50% of our
programmers, about setting up a postgrad course where we will supply the
material. They are quite keen on us, but not so keen to mention that I
dropped out of their course to set up the business. It's not the best
advertisement for them,'' he admitted with a grin.
He attributes part of his success to the luck of being in the right
place at the right time. ''When I was at Linlathen High School, it was
one of the first to run a pilot course for O-grade in computer studies,
so I took that. Then I got an apprenticeship at Timex when they were
building Sinclair Spectrums, so that once again was perfect. I was there
for about three or four years which makes my background hardware not
software, which is actually very useful in running a computer company.
When Timex was having problems, I took voluntary redundancy and went to
the Institute of Technology to do a degree in software, because by then
I was interested in the software side.
''I found first year quite simple, because I had been through it all
before and I started writing programmes at home. With my redundancy
money, I invested in what was then a new system, a Commodore Amiga, and
I had some friends who were interested and we all used to dabble in
programming.
''It took me just over a year to write the first game, Menace,
collaborating (by post) with a chap down south who did the graphics, who
also had a Commodore Amiga at a time when not many people had them. We
sold between 5000 and 10,000, which for a new machine in those days was
very good.
''With my second game, Blood Money, I paid a few of my friends at
colllege to transfer it to their machines and it started to snowball.
When I dropped out then, I took on one person full-time, then when my
friends had finished the course, they started to join me as well. Since
then, we've built up the company from the profit we've made on the games
and it's just grown and grown. We have just taken on the 5000 sq ft
building next door, which used to belong to General Accident.
Eventually, I hope we will build our own custom-built place. We do a lot
of music work now and we need a sound-proof music studio.
''I admit, I would like to finish the course some time, now that I am
taking on all these graduates without having a degree myself. I'll have
to write a paper or something,'' he added.
The breakthrough came with Lemmings, a puzzle game in which the
players had to save the endearing, furry creatures from almost certain
death. It appealed to all ages and topped the games charts around the
world, selling more than three million copies. That degree of success is
elusive. A unicycle racing game recently aimed more for the
SuperNintendo teenage market has not been released in Japan yet because
the unicycle was brought to life by turning the seat into a face -- and
that concept apparently causes the Japanese some difficulty.
Jones estimates that 15% of games account for 85% of the turnover and
so concentrates his research on trying to come up with one of the big
ones.   ''There is a huge difference between bringing out an average
game and bringing out a really original, good game and that's why we
have been so successful in the past. We have the recipe now for a good
game and so instead of jumping on the bandwagon and copying other good
games, which is what other people did with Lemmings, we want to try to
be there first. We normally have 12 people working on a game and we have
to do that to really elevate ourselves from people who are just
producing average games.
''We don't do particularly violent games, although kids like them and
they drive the market, but I am not someone who believes that games can
influence kids in any way. I think the argument that killing something
on a screen is going to make you more likely to kill in real life is a
silly argument.
''We start with the strategy and the environment and then try to come
up with characters to suit. It is normally very simple. I tend to look
for ideas from everyday life and one day one of the programmers was
using a drawing package and it had these small characters walking up a
hill and there was a big gun and it just blasted them when they got to
the top and you had about 50 of them trying to cycle away to escape
being blasted. Really it is something as simple as that and you start to
see a game in it.'' Deceptively simple.

Joe Donnelly finds the dreaded spellcheck putting a Hex on things
HE GIVETH and then sometimes he taketh back, or even subtracteth. The
creator has a sense of humour. He could have made this writer six-four
and built like a Chippendale bookcase, or like Sean Connery in wealth,
Mel Gibson in looks.
On the other hand, he could have said: Be like Jeffrey Archer, Michael
Winner, Jeremy Beadle.
He didn't, but he could have been a little less lax when handing out
the talents. When it comes to the final accounting, he will have to
agree that the best was made of the talent while the going was good, and
then came New Technology.
The creator gave this writer a gift for spelling, almost a hundred per
cent. Even at a tender age, if I saw a word written down, I could spell
it thereafter. Money could be won with this. Teachers and parents, if
not friends, could be impressed. I could make up the marks where
atrocious handwriting failed me. I was hot.
Not being gifted footwise like the others who wanted to be Pele or
Law, a wordy career beckoned. Belatedly, a second talent was revealed at
an early stage of said career. Typing was a dawdle. The big cast-iron
Imperial machines with the heavy keys were just right. One could type
through five sheets of paper and still make a carbon impression on the
sixth.
All went well enough until disaster struck. A little celestial joke
was played which snuffed out those talents in their prime.
New technology came, with those little plastic feathery keyboards,
cissy little things that needed the lightest of strokes. To a keyboard
pounder par excellence, this was a killer. In the old days, the key hit
hardest was the key that wrote the letter on the paper. With new boards,
the slightest touch on a neighbouring key saw it written on screen. Not
spelling mistakes, but typing errors. Millions of them. Whole screeds of
new words were invented daily. Instead of through, what would appear was
trhroiujgh. For about, we got aszbouyrt. Spelling perfection was gone
forever along with hard-earned typing finesse.
Then came electronic spellcheckers and for a brief moment, rescue
seemed on the horizon. One could run the words through the processor
which would pick up all the typos and correct them. Logic? Computers?
Tell me aszbouyrt it!
Oh, it's fine for common-or-garden words like and, but, and from. It's
when we get to writing names, proper nouns, places, towns and cities
that spellchecker's logic blows a resistor, and us writing types tend to
garble on about people, so names are aplenty.
Tony Blair for instance. Run him through the checker and what do we
get? We get TORY for a first name, and there are plenty of folk who see
the similarity in these days of Clause Four rejection. We get Tory
BLARE. Not as inappropriate as one might first consider. Look at that
smile, those dimples, those eyes. He does sort of Blare, doesn't he?
Hurd? Try Hurt, or Hurl or even Curd as alternatives, proffers the
computer, and there's no argument there. There is no alternative in the
machine's silicone brain for Heseltine (plenty in mine though), but try
Hezza and it will correct it to Hex or maybe even Hess, whatever's
worse. John Major's too plain to merit a change, but Bottomley, that
converts instantly to Bottomless, which resembles the abyss facing some
hospitals.
Michael Portillo becomes Portaloo, or Portico. Theresa Gormley
converts to Grossly. Tony is no longer Benn. He's Benign, Bent, or Bed,
according to the mindless, unlibellous machine. Honest.
Hey, it's not John Prescott, but Presto, and that's the magic of the
former sailor man. Gillian Shephard sails on as Galleon, or drinks a
Gallon, who knows which? Have you heard of Glasgow MP Marina Fief? Or
Mania Fife? John Bummer should surely change his name by deed poll.
Having a name like that's a Gummer, for certain. So should the former
Gerry Malone who now comes up on screen after a spellcheck as Greedy
Malign. Are we sure there is no intelligence here?
Two top Tories come up smelling of flowers, but not roses, as Lily and
Forsythia. Norman Lamont is naturally Lament, but occasionally Laminate,
a word often used to describe flexible plastic, which got Norman into
the headlines once. Donald is Dewier these days, and maybe Norman should
be Lord Tibet. He'd probably do better there now. They're not too keen
on Socialism there. Poor George Foulkes is Foulness incarnate, decrees
the machine, though he always seemed a decent enough soul, convivial
too.
On the foreign front, in South Africa Nelson's name is Mangled to
Manila, or Mandrill (a baboon with a colourful bottom), while his wife
Winnie is both Wino and Whine and maybe makes him Wince. Does Jacques
Chirac Shirk? According to new technology that's how he translates.
Benazir Bhutto is a Brute. Walesa Wallops. Boutros Ghalli is
masquerading as Boaters Phalli. Delors Doles and Arafat is
simultaneously Abaft, Afar, Craft, and Graft. But we knew that already.
You choose.
The trouble with spellcheckers is that they don't seem to understand
the Queen's English. What's the point in having an allegedly infallible
inspector who just can't get it right?
Oddly, it's when we move away from the language of our own dear queen
that the checker does get it right at last. Put in some Glasgow
vernacular and it can come up trumps. It's the berries.
Say Polis and it will offer to change it to Police, though sometimes
gives one Polyps and that's no surprise. Heid and Deid re-translate back
to Head and Dead. Toon becomes town and Erse, rather than Irish,
converts to Arse, which was what we meant in the first place, bumming
around as we were with John Selwyn.
Choochters though, are simply a class of chatterers. Teuchters,
alternatively are Touchier. Glesca is full of Glee and we knew that
anyway, on any night of the week. A Cuddy could be muddy, a buddy, ruddy
and sometimes even cuddly. A Stoater, quite naturally, is a girl of
Stature. A wee Bachle stays small, as Bacilli should, or, because of his
vertical challenge, simply remains a Bachelor. If he gets moroculous,
it's still miraculous.
That's the real miracle of it all. Wherever we go, we can't get people
to understand a word we say, yet a darn machine can pick up our sense
without so much as a pause for a glottal stop. Technical wizards design
systems that can't tell Tony from a Tory, Mayhew from Mayhem, and make
an Anagram out of Ingram.
It's only when we try to talk proper that we've got it dumfoonert,
n'that, y'know?

IT'S WORSE than leaving a cola-bottle of paraquat in the fridge. Worse
than mixing beta blockers in the sweetie jar or leaving a two-bar
electric fire burning beside the wean's bath. It can only be one thing,
right? The Internet!
The problem is the whippersnappers. Did you see the reference last
week to the nine-year-old who used the 'net to build a wee napalm bomb?
Very enterprising.
Then there's all that computer porn we hear about. Apparently you
can't connect to the 'net without the naughty parts of wimmin's bodies
arriving by electronic mail. And the tabloids claim the 'net is packed
with perverts, nazis, hackers, computer fraudsters, terrorist manuals,
computer viruses, and the Mafia.
So what do you do when that dreaded computer connects with the 'net?
Relax, here are the words of wisdom.
You put the machine some place accessible by all, not in wee Jimmy's
or wee Jenny's bedroom where they can lay exclusive claim to it. Now you
are in a position to see how the kids actually use it and for what.
You learn everything you possibly can about it yourself. That way you
can find out exactly what is going on inside it. Have one of your
youngsters actually teach you -- you know how they adore showing off.
Look at the programs they use. Make up your mind if they're worth the
house room. If not, scrub them off the disc -- by now they've shown you
how to do that.
Now for the Internet itself. First of all you have to spend on a
modem, a box that allows your machine to use the phone system. Then you
have to spend money to get connected to the 'net. Then you have to spend
money on your monthly account with the company that provides you with
this connection. And, after all that, you have to spend yet more money
on the increased phone bill!
Finding the kind of outrageous material the press forever whinges on
about is not at all easy. Yes, it is there and the diligent,
resourceful, and dedicated can find it the same way you can find blue
videos and dubious literature in seedy little shops here and there in
most big cities. Finding them is rarely easy.
Treat the 'net like a big city and you won't go far wrong. You
wouldn't let your children wander around a big city on their own and you
don't let them wander the 'net alone either. If they strike up e-mail
''conversations'' with strangers just keep a parental eye on the
correspondence.
Finally do not use the 'net as an extension of that electronic
baby-sitter, the video. You cannot just plunk the junior family members
in front of it and go off and do your own thing.
That buzzword ''interactive'' really makes all the difference. With
the Internet you are not interacting with a machine, no matter how
slick, how cool the graphics, how hi-tech it all seems. The 'net is made
up of real live people.
So if you decide it's just the thing to keep the scream team out of
your hair while you sit watching Grandstand of a weekend afternoon don't
be surprised, when you nip into the kitchen for that quick banana
sandwich, to find them clustered round the napalm bomb they're cooking
on the stove!

Memories of Britain's worst rail disaster, which claimed more than 200
lives, has tormented generations of grieving families, as Andy Murray
reports.
THE best part of 40 years is a long time for anyone to wear the
coal-black attire of mourning. Johannah Malone, however, could be
forgiven for radiating the funereal melancholy of an undertaker: her
lips could never spell out how she felt from the second year of the
First World War until her death in 1952 at the age of 92. Repression
ruled. She had never been able to bury her beloved only son, John
Malone.
On May 22, 1915, that fresh-faced army bugler, straight out of George
Heriot's School in Edinburgh, had been scorched into the stratosphere in
Britain's worst rail disaster. A glance at a picture taken shortly
before his untimely death leaves you with the impression that he was
about 14, rather than 16. He had been in the front coach of a troop
train whose length had been squashed like a concertina from 213 yards to
67 yards.
During the war, village upon village grieved for the dead of the
Western Front. Johannah's grief was greater: she had a massive nervous
breakdown. Many years later, the relatives of the Lockerbie victims
would have expert counselling, but the Great War effort meant folk just
had to get on with things.
In public Johannah wore black from head to foot, apart from a white
collar, for the rest of her life. Every year on May 22 she would shut
herself away, and the family would hide the newspapers in case she saw
the ''in memoriam'' columns. She eventually died in a nursing-home in
Edinburgh, still pining for the son who had been carbonised by the
incompetence of railwaymen.
No auto-da-fe ever began as unexpectedly as that at Quintinshill. A
''flanker'' meant that James Tinsley, the daytime signalman, got an
extra half-hour in his bed, and a ride on the local train instead of
walking the two miles to work from Gretna.
Officially Signalman Meakin's shift ended at 6am, but the quid-pro-quo
arrangement meant that he would work until 6.30am. On the day of death
he was scribbling train movements on to a piece of paper well after
Tinsley was supposed to arrive. When Tinsley did arrive, he would copy
the jottings in his own handwriting into official rail ledgers.
Meanwhile, two northbound express trains were running late, and amid
idle chat in the signalman's box Meakin (more intent on getting the
jottings transferred than on any thoughts of shunting trains into
sidings) forgot to tell the worker who manned the Kirkpatrick box to the
north that the local train was on the southbound track. He also forgot
to place the indispensable fail-safe collars on the line's signal
levers.
A southbound troop train, sped towards the scene. It drilled into the
local train at 70mph; its coaches -- wooden and lit by gas cylinders --
carried the 7th (Leith) Battalion of the Royal Scots. Ironically, and
mercifully maybe, there was to be no Gallipoli for half the battalion.
The death-trap had sprung. Quintinshill was an inferno. Most perished
instantly. There was no pre-battle irritable bowel, or the bullshit from
trench-bound superiors.
One of the express trains had passed safely, but the second ploughed
into the carnage. In all, the Quintinshill conflagration claimed the
lives of 215 Royal Scots; 191 were injured. Twelve other people,
passengers and rail workers on the express and on the local, also lost
their lives. Fifty-five more were injured.
One newspaper declared the following day (as the debris still blazed):
''It may be questioned whether in the long and bloodstained history of
the Debatable Land, where the tragedy took place, there is set down
anything more startlingly and poignantly tragic than the fate which, in
the course of a few minutes of shock and flame, practically wiped out of
existence a half-battalion of the 7th of Leith Royal Scots.
Bob Robertson, of Gretna, who is now 93, remembers pedalling to the
aftermath on his brother's bike. ''It was a very sad day. There were
hundreds of people there. I got there about two hours after it happened.
The engines were lying about the field like bairns' toys. Everything was
heaps of scrap metal. You have no idea what it was like.
Bob saw several soldiers lying in the field smoking cigarettes to calm
the shock. Rachel Buchanan, probably the last survivor of Quintinshill,
remembers just such a scene. She was three-years-old and on her way to a
holiday with her grandparents in Lanarkshire when the express smashed.
Her mother and her one-year-old brother, Dickson Nimmo, were two of the
seven on board the express who died.
Alexander Sutherland Neill, the man who was to establish the liberal
Summerhill school, also walked on the canvas of Quintinshill. During the
war he was stand-in dominie at Gretna public school. He cycled to the
scene of the disaster after the postman rushed through the village
telling everybody that a Zeppelin had bombed the troop train.
Rumours of German saboteurs circulated freely, and there is an
unconfirmed report that Meakin knocked a young boy down as he fled the
scene in shock on a motorcycle.
Neill's memoirs record: ''The scene resembled a silent film. The only
sounds were the hissing of the engines and the pops of the cartridges as
fire crept along the wreckage. Men were lying dead or dying; one soldier
with both legs torn off asked me for a cigarette, and he grinned as I
lit it up for him. 'May as well lose them here as in France,' he said
lightly. He died before the cigarette was half-smoked.''
Officers shot men who were hopelessly pinned into the debris, and they
used bayonets when the bullets ran out. The less hardy of them wore
gas-masks so that their faces would not register when the soldiers
knocked on the pearly gates.
Audrey Logue's father, John, who witnessed the scene as a boy, left
her with a vivid account of the Dante-like scene. Her father and his
school pal became firefighters when they broke into the school kitchens
to find anything they could carry water in. ''There were bodies all over
the place; some dead, some dying, and some with parts torn off. Some
screamed to be shot. Some of the poor lads were trapped and nobody could
do a thing about it,'' said Mrs Logue, who now lives in London.
There were many troops on the London express home on leave from the
slaughter on the Western Front, and they said it was worse than the
trenches. Some of those on the troop train who survived the impact
staggered out only to be hit by the express.
It took Carlisle fire brigade four hours to arrive, owing to a mix-up,
but it probably would not have made any difference, given the extent of
the damage. Gretna folk had to battle on alone using a small pump to
take water out of a ditch. The fire had been exacerbated by live coals
and by the gas cylinders invented by the same man who made poison-gas
for the Germans.
Johannah Malone, back home near Holyrood Park, was spared the
appalling immediacy of the holocaust, but the trauma was long-lasting.
''She was a typical old Scots lady,'' says Johannah's grand-daughter,
Joan Thomson of Dumfries. ''She did not know for such a long time
whether John had been killed. The battalion records had been lost in the
accident, and they did not know who was where.
''Nothing of him was ever found. He was incinerated. He had been in
the front coach along with the band. The idea was that they could more
easily get out of the train and head the procession of the troops down
to Liverpool docks as they boarded for Gallipoli.
''The death certificate did not arrive for about three months. My
grandmother kept hoping he had gone on the boat. On the rare occasions
she spoke of Quintinshill, she would shake her head and her sad eyes
would look at you and she would say, 'He jeest forgot' -- a reference to
the signalman's comment during the trial at Edinburgh.''
The trauma extended to Joan Thomson's mother, Blanche, who had been
studying at Portobello High School at the time of the tragedy. Affected
by her brother's death, she failed her exams. And every November until
she died a couple of years ago at 93 she would pin a Haig fund poppy on
to the last photograph of the long-lost bugler.
Joan Thomson says: ''My mother also refused to travel up the west
coast line with LMS, choosing instead to take the eastern route with
LNER.
''There are parallels between Quintinshill and Lockerbie. You read
about the hospitality and friendliness of people helping support
victims' relatives. Everybody rallied round. There was no counselling in
those war days, of course. People had to support each other.''
Initially, not even the 63 surviving soldiers were shown much respect.
They were sent out to the troopship to sort out the equipment, but the
commanding officer successfully pleaded with the War Office to send them
home. As they marched from the docks back to the train station,
Liverpool kids, who mistook them for German prisoners, pelted stones at
them.
FRANK FERRIER's face must have been as white as the Alps as he stood
in his Edinburgh home fingering the personal effects of his dead son,
Thomas, yet another Scottish Tommy mown down by the war machine.
Thomas's wallet contained a photograph of his fiancee with a bullet-hole
drilled into her face; it was the last remnant of a short life
terminated at Gallipoli. Anyone who watched Peter Weir's film about the
bloody campaign in the Dardanelles can visualise the horror which that
young ''lion led by donkeys'' must have seen.
However, his nephew, Robert Cameron, sums it up: ''It is all very sad,
but it must have been repeated so many times, and there must be millions
of stories like it.'' Such is war. In one way Private Ferrier had been
lucky. For three years he had travelled on the train which was last on
the timetable before the one involved in Britain's worst rail disaster.
That Royal Scot escaped, only to be killed in Turkey.
Helen Price, who lives in Edinburgh, takes a sanguine view of the
tragedy at Quintinshill, which claimed her uncle, Andrew Baillie, aged
17. ''They all joined up to be with their pals, to be in there at the
beginning and to be a hero,'' she says. ''It was the thing to do. My
father's family were dock-workers in Leith and they were poor. My
father, the eldest of nine, had to go to Dalmeny drill hall in Leith to
identify his brother's body.
''There was a bit of controversy. My mother eventually received #250
in compensation, but initially there was an argument that they should
not get anything, since they had not been killed in action.
WHATEVER they did, Tinsley and Meakin were also victims of
Quintinshill. Both were found guilty of culpable homicide. Tinsley was
sentenced to three years' penal servitude; Meakin was jailed for 18
months. Both suffered mental breakdowns and were released early. Meakin
died young, away from the railways. Tinsley became a lamp-man at
Carlisle and died a lonely and broken old man in 1967, having had much
time to reflect on his mistakes.
The Board of Trade report by Lieutenant-Colonel Druitt stated in
September, 1915: ''Men engaged in routine work, where the conditions may
easily become dangerous either to themselves or others, sometimes get
into a loose way of working, and habitually neglect regulations which
have been laid down for their own or others' protection.''
The railway authorities were quick to abandon gas-lighting and wooden
carriages after Quintinshill, following Druitt's recommendations. But
they bought up as many photographs of the disaster as possible, and
destroyed the negatives. Moreover, they resisted the erection of a
memorial to the Quintinshill victims. The first memorial was put up in
Rosebank cemetery in Leith, where most of the dead were buried (four
bodies were never claimed nor identified, and were interred in Glasgow
at the expense of the corporation). Last December, during torrential
weather, a second memorial was erected at Larbert station (the troops
had boarded the train at Larbert).
The Western Front Association has commissioned a third memorial, which
will go up on Sunday, May 21, at the car-park at Gretna service station,
half a mile from Quintinshill. The railways still did not offer land for
a memorial. The charitable view is that locating it close to the site of
the three-train crash would have interfered with electrification
equipment.
Rachel Buchanan, now 83, has been asked to unveil the memorial. In
Larbert, the skies opened. Let us hope that the May birds are singing at
Quintinshill, and that we all spare a thought for Johannah Malone.

AS YOU cross the majestic Kessock Bridge from Inverness, it is easy
for visitors more intent on reaching the rugged outposts of Wester Ross
and Caithness to miss a hidden tranquil corner of the Highlands.
Surrounded on three sides by the Beauly Firth, the Moray Firth, and the
Cromarty Firth, the Black Isle seems to exist as a contradiction.
It is not an island at all, nor is it particularly black. These rich
rolling pastures probably gained the name because of the unusually mild
climate of the area which rarely brings snow, leaving the fields dark
all winter.
This is a land deep in history, folklore, and culture. On the road to
Munlochy there is a remarkable sight which is evidence of the continuity
of ancient ritual, even in this cynical modern age. The ice-cold water
of the Cloutie Well spills into a trough by the roadside beneath a tree
completely festooned with multicoloured rags.
Dedicated to St Boniface, the tradition is believed to owe its origin
to a much older deity or fairy. It decrees that anyone foolish enough to
remove another person's rag will inherit their ills. Clearly the local
inhabitants have lost none of their respect for the ancient traditions;
but with twentieth-century green-awareness, they have requested that
only biodegradable material be left.
Beyond the panoramic views of Munlochy Bay the road leaves the coast
and passes through the patchwork of arable fields and stands of dark
deciduous woodland, until you return to the seaboard village of Avoch.
Avoch is neat and tidy, with well-kept cottages, antique shop, ships'
chandlers, and a delightful-looking harbour. Sadly, the piers of this
quiet anchorage were strenuously signposted as off-limits to all but the
harbour trustees; its sole visitor for the day was forced to move on.
A mile along the foreshore sits the cathedral town of Fortrose whose
harbour, built by Thomas Telford in 1817, holds no such restrictions.
The yachts of the Chanonry Sailing Club shelter here; weekend regattas
fill the bay with colourful craft.
The peaceful streets of this ancient royal burgh are the setting for
the annual St Boniface Fair (in August) when the townsfolk dress up in
period costume to sell their wares on the original site in the Square.
The cathedral was first built in 1250 but much was lost during the
troubled period of the Reformation in 1560. Today only the pink-red
sandstone ruins of the South Aisle and Chapter House remain among the
lovely yew-studded Green.
The town was once dominated by shoemakers and an astonishing 32 of
them occupied premises in the main street and nearby closes. Nowadays
visitors will find much else on offer with a superbly located golf
course on the Ness, and an excellent new leisure centre complete with
multi-purpose sports hall and fitness centre, and a picturesque camping
and caravan site overlooking the Moray Firth.
From Fortrose it is an easy walk out along the southern shore of the
Ness to Chanonry Point, where there are stunning views of Fort George
across the estuary.
If you are lucky you may see the school of bottle-nosed dolphins which
regularly visits these waters along with porpoises and grey seals. The
whitewashed lighthouse on the Point stands next to a large rock which
marks the spot where the seventeenth-century fortune-teller, Brahan
Seer, was executed. His crime had been to foretell the doom of the
powerful Seaforth-Mackenzie family for which he was burned in a barrel
of tar in 1660. This ''punishment'', however, would not stop the
eventual outcome of his prediction from being realised within the next
generation.
Walking back along the north shore of the Ness leads you quickly into
the quiet one-street village of Rosemarkie. Well worth a visit is the
award-winning Groam House Museum which has a wealth of intricately
carved Pictish stones. Below the well-kept gardens of this sleepy little
place stretches a long, empty rust-coloured sand beach which leads to
Cairds Cave, once home to early man and reached only at low tide.
Rosemarkie is also home to the Fairy Glen, a wooded valley steeped in
mythology. A narrow path picks its way up a deep-sided gorge, through a
carpet of primroses and bluebells, and finishes at a torrent of
waterfalls, rapids, and pools. On the way you pass a millpond from which
ice was once hacked out and lugged back down the steep ravine to supply
the local ice houses of Fortrose for preserving salmon.
The historic town of Cromarty is situated at the tip of the peninsula,
sheltered by the enormous Sutor headlands. Its huge Georgian merchant
houses and rows of immaculate cottages have rightly led it to be
referred to as ''the jewel in the crown of Scottish vernacular
architecture''. The town remains the best preserved example of an
eighteenth-century Scottish port and is today enjoying a renaissance as
fine historical buildings such as the old brewery and hemp works are put
to new uses.
With its innovative blend of old and new there is lots to see among
the vennels and narrow streets. The original thatched cottage of Hugh
Miller has an exhibition of the life of the town's most famous son as
geologist, writer, theologian, and newspaper editor.
Further down the street, the Cromarty Courthouse, built in 1773, is
now an imaginative museum offering a vivid interpretation of the history
of the town, with a reconstructed trial using computer-controlled
animated figures. Cromarty is a town with its roots deeply buried in the
past but without a hint of contradiction it clearly has its eyes focused
firmly on the future.

Jim Hewitson describes a tale of Jacobite bravery about a man, a
drummer, and a whore who captured Manchester in 1745.
YOU CAN take my word for it. By this time next year you'll have
overdosed on Jacobite jollifications. A sporranful of events is planned
to mark the 250th anniversary of the 1745 Uprising, or Rebellion
(depending which side of the plaid your sympathies lie), and eventually
you'll want to lash out maniacally at every tartan shortie tin or
plastic Charlie that hoves into view.
Months ago, you'll recall, by way of innoculation against the coming
onslaught, we started looking among the rank-and-file Jacobites in
search of bit players in this great drama whose stories perhaps deserve
a wider audience.
Pursuing this theme, we come to the remarkable saga of Sergeant
Dickson (no Christian name that I can discover) who successfully
switched camps after the Battle of Prestonpans (September 21, 1745) and
went on to take Manchester single-handedly -- well, with the help,
intriguingly, of a drummer and a whore.
After being taken prisoner in the rout of Johnny Cope's forces,
Dickson is said to have become personal servant to the Chevalier de
Johnstone, aide-de-camp to the Prince. By late November, 1745, the
Jacobite army had reached Preston, and on the evening of November 27,
Dickson, whether under special orders or more likely off his own,
adventurous bat, set out with his mistress and a drummer boy for
Manchester.
According to recordings of the uprising, they rode through the night
and were in the city the following afternoon where they dined in some
style at the sign of the Bull's Head, openly and boldly declaring their
intention to convert the entire city to the Jacobite cause and to enlist
recruits on behalf of the ''yellow-haired laddie''.
They must have made an interesting trio as they paraded around town,
the drummer giving it laldie while Dickson and his wench touted for
recruits. At first the Mancunians didn't know what to make of it all.
They assumed that this show of bravado meant the Highland army was but a
few miles distant.
When news filtered through that it would be some hours, evening at the
earliest, before they would arrive, people began to surround the Scots
in a ''tumultuous manner''.
Dickson was equal to this threat and as the circle closed around them
he produced a blunderbuss and threatened to blow the brains out of
anyone who laid a hand on them. By circling with his gun Dickson
succeeded in pushing the throng back until a group of Jacobite
sympathisers, several hundred strong, appeared on the scene.
The sergeant's moment of glory had arrived and he led the Jacobite
contingent around town, recruiting as he went. For the rest of the day
he offered five guineas to each recruit and by the time the Jacobite
army marched into town Dickson is said to have recruited 180 volunteers
in this manner.
Prince Charles was cheered all the way to his lodgings, the town was
illuminated and bells rung. Important people came to kiss his hand and a
vast crowd of all classes arrived to watch him sup.
By this stage Charles was already debating the manner in which he
would enter London, on foot or on horseback, and what clothes he would
wear.
The sad fact is that this was the watershed in the campaign. Support
from the North of England failed to materialise. The Jacobite commanders
had expected at least 1500 recruits in Manchester, and most of the few
hundred who did join up insisted that they were purely mercenaries.
Support from the wealthy families of Lancashire was not forthcoming.
Dickson was taken prisoner at Culloden the following spring and, as a
traitor and turncoat in the Government's eyes was, inevitably, executed
in Edinburgh.

IN MAY, the woods of Scotland vibrate with sex. Nothing vibrates like
the Redstart in song and display, the elements of avian sexual energy.
It occupies those open woods, like the sessile oakwoods of Wester Ross
and the Scots pines of Rothiemurchus, which are patterned to a human
scale.
On arrival from sub-Saharan Africa, the male chases the female through
the glades and clearings, then displays at the entrance to a potential
nesting hole the long, red fan of his tail. A Scots name for the bird,
Brantail or brand-tail, catches its colour of glowing peat. Even more
''startling'' is the way the male crouches in front of his mate, hissing
and showing the yellow inside of his mouth below his black and white
forehead; he fans his tail again and holds his wings vibrating above his
back -- all to indicate readiness for copulation.
Anthropomorphic commentary here would be inappropriate, except to say
that such kenspeckle behaviour must have a high evolutionary value --
and to question, as always, the language in which scientific observation
is reported: ''The pursuit of the female by the male is probably
basically an act of aggression, though both sexes may be sexually
stimulated by it.''
The vibration in bird song comes from the syrinx, a resonating chamber
and membranes down near the lungs. The song of the Redstart is ''a
promise never performed'' as W H Hudson put it in 1909. It begins with
arresting phrases, gushing and tender, then abruptly gets lost in ''a
curious little farrago of gulping and squealing sounds''. Yet on a warm
May afternoon nothing is more fascinating than hearing that sweet warble
and watching the flash of that flaming tail.

* WELCOME to Sight Lines, an informative report on the bird species of
rarity or interest in our regions including any reports of national
significance.
* So far this year there have been some excellent records of rare
birds in the country including a rare Forsters Tern at the Ythan
Estuary. The trend continues with more this week.
* This weeks highlights include, Black-Browed Albatross, Forsters
Tern, King Eider, Little Egret and a scattering of the usual spring
migrants.
* Reports are listed in their approximate order of rarity or interest
of the species, giving dates seen. Unfortunately no guarantees can be
given that the birds will still be present at this time.
SHETLAND
The Black-Browed Albatross (14th) remains on North Unst having
returned to summer here for its 22nd year. Its attempts to mate with one
of the gannet colony should prove to be as productive as previous failed
efforts. Also on Shetland a Snowy Owl (9th) on Fetlar, a White Billed
Diver (14th) on West Mainland and a White Stork (11th).
CENTRAL
A Blue Headed Wagtail (12th), was seen at Grangemouth skinflat lagoons
along with an immature Marsh Harrier over the reedbeds.
STRATHCLYDE
A calling Quail (14th) could be heard near Mochlan, Ayrshire. Up to
five Garganey (6th) remained at the RSPB Lochwinnoch reserve on Barr
Loch setting a new Scottish record count for these migrant ducks. A
Marsh Harrier (6th) could be seen hunting over the reserve on most days
and an unusual sighting of a Leahes Petrel was reported on the (3rd)
along with a Wryneck (3rd). Up to eight Black Necked Grebes and three
Ruddy Ducks could be seen at the Loch of Kinnordy reserve. Ruddy Ducks
can now be frequently seen throughout the central belt particularly in
some north-east Glasgow Lochs.
GRAMPIAN
The Forsters Tern was again present at the Ythan Estuary along with a
King Eider both seen well (13th).
TAYSIDE
At the RSPB Vane Farm reserve a Little Egret was still present (13th)
along with a single Bean Goose with a group 100 Pink Feet (13th).
NATIONAL
With another mild start to spring the South of England has produced
yet more exceptional records with sightings of a Red Footed Falcon in
East Sussex (9th), a Greater Yellowlegs in Essex (14th), a Night Heron
in Dorset (14th), a Red Backed Shrike in Lincolnshire (14th) and two
Temmincks Stints at Cley (9th).
If you would like any further information on birds, perhaps one that
you would like to see but don't know where or when to look, then please
write to Sight Lines, Weekender, The Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow
G1 1QP.

IAN BROWN: Artistic Director of Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh
I'M halfway through Miss Smillas Feeling for Snow by Peter Hoeg. I was
given it as a present and it's got a nice feeling about it.
I quite like novels that are set in foreign countries and give you a
sort of feeling for a city or culture that you don't know. This is set
in Copenhagen, and though I've never been there I had a strong idea of
what it was like, and this book just confirms that. It's an unsolved
mystery about why this boy died and why this woman wants to get to the
bottom of it all. It's more a psychological crime novel that gets into
the characters' heads than a straightforward thriller.
I'm trying not to go on book-buying binges because I've got this guilt
thing if I've got too many books around that I haven't read. I do tend
to re-read books. On holiday last year I did this with John Fowles's The
Magus. I remember being really hooked on it the first time I read it but
I couldn't piece all of the plot together, so it was quite interesting
to go back to it years later.
As regards books on drama theory, I've just read Ute Hager's An
Actor's Handbook. She's a German actress who lives in America. Though
she's not very well known here, in America she's revered as a practical
teacher of acting. This second book is just an extension of her first --
A Respect For Acting.
I found both of them really useful just to have as standbys for a very
clear analysis of what acting is. It's very stimulating and interesting
to look at acting from the actor's point of view. If you're a director
then you need to be able to understand what's going on in order to help
the actor get better.

Paul Young reveals a passion for old atlases and the gems of
information they contain for the assiduous fisherman
I HAVE to admit to a weakness. Yet another one. I can often be found
gazing lovingly at the object of my affection, laid bare before me. I
will be told fascinating things and spend hours in rapture as I explore
the beautiful detail of my love. If I am lucky, I'll find some subtle
nuance I've missed on our many previous trysts, but then that is the
fascination of maps.
For the fisherman, antique, old, and modern maps can be a mine of
information on the waters we fish, fresh and salt. You'll find a
storehouse of pictorial history dating back as far as the sixteenth
century.
One of the earliest people to map Scotland was Gerhard Kremer, a
Flemish cartographer, born in 1512, better known by the Latin version of
his name, Gerardus Mercator. He produced his first world map in 1538 and
his first globe in 1541. His great Atlas was started in 1585 and
completed by his son in 1594. In this, the shape of Scotland is
certainly recognisable, though ''Skye, Mula and Yla'' are about twice
the size they should be and the waist between Clyde and Forth is thinner
than that of a Victorian vamp. There is ''St Johnston'', but no Perth
and ''Aberdone'' but no Aberdeen, though the Tay, Dee, and Don all
appear in roughly the correct places.
Another famous mapmaker from the Low Countries was Blaeu, or, as on a
wonderful map of ''Orcadum and Shetlandiae'', Guiljelmus Blaeuw. The
names of the islands are given in both English and old Norse --
''Siapins Oy'' becoming Shapinsay in Orkney and ''Pheodors Oy'' is now
Fetlar in Shetland. But, though the Loch of Stenness is still
recognisable from ''Stonehouse Loch'', could what Blaeu describes on the
west coast of Hoy as ''the moft magnificent natural Fort called
Braburgh'' be the Old Man of Hoy?
Many of Blaeu's seventeenth-century maps were actually executed by a
Scotsman, Timothy Pont. He was the minister at Dunnet in Caithness from
1601 to 1608 and was one of Scotland's earliest cartographers. A number
of his Scottish surveys were incorporated into the Blaeu Atlas of 1654
and looking at his detailed maps of Scottish counties, I am always
amazed at how accurate they are and fascinated to see how names of
places have changed over the years. For instance, when you are pollack
fishing off Dunnet Head in the Pentland Firth, Pont would have had you
taking your fish off ''Wenliknap Head'' in the ''Pichtland Fyrth''.
His map of Lauderdale shows the town of ''Cailso'' at the junction of
Tweed and Teviot, but further downriver Sprouston and Carham are spelt
exactly as you would find them some 300 years later on an excellent map
of the Salmon Pools on the River Tweed, compiled by Nigel Houldsworth.
This is accompanied by like maps of the Spey, Dee, and Tay and if I ever
have a spare moment, I'll stop for a look at one or the other of them.
I find a certain fascination in how pools were first named. I can
understand the Minister's Pool or Cast or Stone and the concomitant
Manse Run or Stream or Pot and I can even take in the logic of an
eponymous pool -- Sykses' Corner, Pilkington's Point, or Kerr's Shot,
though I often wonder who were the Three Brethren and Little Ann and
what she did so that the next pool downstream became known as Ann Foul.
And I am not baffled with the functional descriptions of bits of water
-- the Bleachings, Butterwash Stream and Bathing Pool, Hempseed Ford,
the Boatshiel and the Pumping House.
But there are others that one might be best to steer clear of. I don't
want a touch of the Shampach, the Bloodies, or the Kink Pot and neither,
thank you, a week in bed with Slop Garach, the Slaps, or Ramp Heugh. I
say nothing about my feelings for The Neukie, and Tickle Stone.
But there are some beautiful names: Delnapot, Cooperee, Pool Eke;
Gled, the Griggle and Gullets; Polcrochan, Polmachree, and Polyoung.
Actually, you may have noticed that last one is made up, but what a
lovely way to be remembered as an angler -- having a pool named after
you. In my case it is likely to be Young's Blank, a phrase I often hear,
or perhaps Paul's Putts on Tweed. No matter, I would be proud to be part
of the lore of the river and be able to say I was well and truly on the
map.

Northern Ireland is looking forward to more tourists than ever. But
where are they going to sleep? Kirsty Scott investigates.
TOURISM officials in Northern Ireland are expecting a record 1.5
million visitors this year following the paramilitary ceasefires. And
more than 15,000 extra beds will be needed to cope with an anticipated
2.5 million tourists a year by the end of the century.
Industry minister Baroness Denton said immediate action was needed to
improve standards of quality for tourists in the province. Ian
Henderson, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, is to
head a special task force to find out what needs to be done to create
the right astmosphere and provide better holiday packages. Tourism
inquiries for the first quarter of the year have shot up by almost 70%
to more than 100,000.
Baroness Denton said additional bed and breakfast accommodation was
needed, along with longer opening hours, improved distribution of
tourism information, crash training courses, and a tidy-up of the
province.
''It is essential that we offer our guests not only a warm welcome,
but quality of service and experience to enhance visitors' enjoyment and
appreciation of Northern Ireland,'' she told the holiday trade in
Belfast.
Before the IRA and loyalist ceasefires eight months ago, hotel
occupancy was running at around 40%. It had now risen to 62% -- the
highest since records began in l973.
Baroness Denton added: ''The excellent tourism statistics of the last
six months are a clear indication of the potential for increasing
visitors numbers -- our challenge is to make sure we turn this potential
into a reality by offering a holiday experience second to none.''
* MEANWHILE, in Antigua, tourism officials have a damage limitation
exercise on their hands after a second tourist was shot by robbers.
Robert Perry, 41, a taxi-driver, underwent emergency surgery to remove
his ruptured spleen after he was shot in the chest and groin two weeks
ago. Fellow British tourists queued up to give blood to help save him.
Robert Perry and a companion were attacked on Monday, the last day of
their holiday at the island. They had already checked out of the Yepton
Beach Resort in Deep Bay, but had returned to their room to make sure
they had not forgotten anything. Two robbers made off with a bag
containing personal documents, passports, and credit cards.
It was the second time this year that a tourist was shot by robbers on
the island which -- together with neighbouring Barbuda -- attracts
around 50,000 British sunseekers each year. Canadian Wendy Newbigging,
26, was shot in the chest in a robbery on an Antiguan beach in February.
Tourism officials said Mr Perry's shooting had prompted a special
cabinet meeting to discuss visitors' safety.
''Antigua and Barbuda is still a safe destination, and it is the
government's resolve that no-one will be allowed to destroy the
country's good image,'' said one official. He said that joint police and
army patrols around tourist areas were ''stretched thin'' by the Antigua
Sailing Week at the beginning of May, which attracted 241 racing yachts
and thousands of visitors. It's thought the island will set up a hotline
and task force to help protect foreign visitors.
* BETTER news from Luxembourg where the national airline Luxair saw
its net profit more than doubled in 1994. The airline said in a
statement that net profit rose to 305.9 million Luxembourg francs ($10.8
million) from 133.8 million ($4.7 million) in 1993. Turnover rose to
6.96 billion francs ($246 million) from 6.17 billion ($218.1 million).
Passenger traffic rose 12.3% to 704,548 and seat occupancy rose to
57.24% from 56.12% in 1993 despite a rise in the number of seats
offered.
* AS Cuba continues to expand its tourist potential, a new guide has
been issued giving practical information on the island. Guide to Cuba
from Bradt publications gives details of Cuban history and culture plus
advice on how to survive the black market. Call 01494 873478 for more
information.
* FOR all those who think a simple folding toothbrush is not enough,
the firm Explore Trader has launched an expanded range of travel
accessories, including tablets which combat stomach infections before
they start and biodegradable soap so washing won't pollute the local
environment. Information on 01252 316016.
* TRAVEL agents are gearing up for the summer onslaught. According to
the findings of the recent British National Travel survey, British
holidaymakers took 58m holidays in 1994, 26.5m abroad. The peak season
is May to September with 65% of all trips taken during that period.
* WITH a steady increase in the number of women travelling alone for
business, or pleasure, Forte Crest hotels have taken steps to meet the
needs of the lone female guest. At the Forte Crest Hotel in Glasgow,
specially designated LadyCrest rooms are located next to lifts to avoid
long walks down empty corridors. Female guests aren't required to use
the hotel car-park, but are advised they can hand their keys into
reception and have a valet park the vehicle for them. The hotel has had
a policy for some time of not disclosing room numbers and names, but
will advise guests if they have a visitor. In addition, women dining
alone are automatically asked if they have a preference to be seated at
a particular table.
* ONE of Windsor's top country house hotels, Oakley Court, is staging
a teddy bears' picnic on the weekend of June 23-25. A special Sunday
lunch has been set up with a children's picnic on the lawn, and guests,
old or young, are encouraged to being their teddy bears along. The
weekend costs #154 per adult and from #58 for children. Call 01753
609988.

DURING the past couple of years, a remarkable number of well-to-do
families have suddenly felt the necessity for what in farming circles is
called ''a redd-oot''. There seems to have been a mass compulsion to get
up into the attics of the stately home and see what is lying there. It
never has anything to do with Lloyd's, of course.
The latest to succumb to the clean-out principle is the Stirling
family of Keir in Perthshire. Their redd-oot is radical because
Christie's are selling the things they no longer require in a three-day
event, next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, May 22-24 -- 1500 lots in all
-- at Keir Mains in Dunblane, on the Doune and Dunblane showground.
Don't miss it because it has everything from magnificent furniture to a
Royal Company of Archers uniform and a rocking horse.
The Stirlings have a long and distinguished history, having been
documented as living around Dunblane since the fourteenth century, and
they served as administrators and soldiers as well as showing a keen
interest in farming. One family member, Sir William Stirling-Maxwell,
who succeeded to the baronetcy in 1865, brought together a fine art
collection, part of which can be seen at Pollok House in Glasgow. Among
the several military men in the family, Sir David Stirling, who died in
1990, founded the SAS.
The present head of the family, Mr Archibald Stirling, no longer lives
at Keir House because it was sold 20 years ago. Since then the furniture
has remained in storage and much of it is now to be sold along with
selected pieces from other family homes at Cawder near Glasgow and
Ardchullarie in Perthshire.
Though there are books, paintings, china, and objets d'art, the main
attractions for serious collectors will be the furniture, for there are
such treasures as a George II mahogany kneehole desk (estimated around
#25,000); a delicately carved Scottish George II giltwood mirror
(estimated around #8000); and another George II giltwood ornamental
mirror which is expected to sell for about #30,000.
The mouth-watering list goes on -- a beautifully veneered George III
rosewood breakfast table; a George II rosewood games table; and four
Louis XV giltwood bergere chairs by the French furniture-maker
Jean-Jacques Pothier who worked in Paris around 1750. The chairs are
estimated at around #15,000 a pair.
The sale's first morning session is due to end with a Scottish George
III secretaire cabinet, copied from a design by Thomas Chippendale, and
Christie's expect it to make around #18,000.
Among the lesser lots on the first day is an unusual German floral
marquetry games board which dates from the sixteenth century and
contains a board for playing Shakespeare's nine men's morris. It is
thought to be worth around #5000. Another oddity is a wicket picnic
hamper fitted with flasks, sandwich boxes, and intimidating-looking
locks (around #300).
Pictures are to be sold on the second day and though there is little
of any great value, there are several of considerable interest. The most
expensive, at around #40,000, is likely to be a pair of oil paintings of
a goatherd and a shepherdess by Phillip Peter Roos, also called Rosa de
Tivoli (1657-1706).
From a historian's point of view, the star of the show, however, is a
chalk portrait of Prince Charles Edward Stuart by Ozias Humphrey, RA,
who drew the sadly deteriorating once Bonnie Prince in Florence in 1776.
His pouched and cynical eyes stare out of the paper and his fleshy jowls
give him a look of Edward Heath, who surely could hardly be called
Bonnie. The drawing carries the modest estimate of around #2000.
China is to be dispersed on the final day and is sure to attract
collectors, private and professional alike, as it includes a Meissen
dessert service painted with exotic birds and nine Dutch Delft
eighteenth-century plates painted with emblems of the months of the year
(estimate about #3500 as some of the rims are chipped). Another set of
similarly dated 12 Dutch Delft blue and white plates showing whaling
scenes should sell for around #8000.
The final day will be a big draw for private buyers with the dispersal
of eccentric bits and pieces that often make astonishing prices at sales
like this -- cushions, curtains, a collection of military brass buttons
and badges, stair rods, bathroom stools, and bedroom chairs. There is
something for everyone.
MARKET TIPS
* Just because an armchair is old and battered that's no excuse to put
it to the bonfire. Phillips, the Edinburgh auctioneers, found themselves
sitting pretty last month when they sold a pair of much the
worse-for-wear mahogany framed armchairs for #7400 when their top
expectation had been #900. The buttoned leather upholstery was torn and
gaping but what interested the dealer who bought the chairs was that the
frames were sound and had unusual castors, larger than normal and
extremely efficient.

* Perthshire-based John Currie, founder of the John Currie Singers,
chorus master of the Halle (a role he relinquishes at the end of May),
and artistic consultant to the Perth Festival, describes his eating and
drinking on a working day's sortie to Manchester.
IT was a typical travelling day. I got up quite early and had the same
breakfast as always -- two vitamin C pills, a glass of orange juice and
a large bowl of porridge which I had made myself.
Heading for Manchester, I had to change trains in Glasgow. I avoid
anything to do with BR food. At Peckhams in Central Station I bought a
tub of humus (I first came across it when I worked in Israel), bread,
Brussels pate, and Esrom cheese. I had this on the train and drank
mineral water with it.
I had half an hour to spare at my Manchester hotel and had a whisky
(Grouse) with ice and some nuts. Somebody always comes to take me to
rehearsals -- this time it was a purely choral one at the Zion
Institute. There was a huge programme to get through -- Mozart's C minor
Mass, Handel's Dixit Dominus, and Holst's The Hymn of Jesus, as well as
auditions and a training class.
After rehearsals I used to go to posh restaurants, but I got fed up
with that. I went back to my hotel and had lasagna and a large glass of
red wine at 10.30pm, then went to bed (I had to catch a train at 5.15
the next morning). The reason I don't eat out so much now is that it's
not nearly as good as eating at home!

You can slice it, dice it, chop it, skin it . . . so, who said
cucumber was just for sandwiches or garnishing? Certainly not Lady
Claire Macdonald who has a taste for this coolest of customers
OPTIMIST that I am, after our endless long wet winter, and then the
real winter we suffered in March, I anticipate a really roasting summer.
I will never forget the whole week here when the temperature was
consistently higher in Skye than in Delhi. We all moved about as though
in slow motion.
But that is what I love about seasons, their contrast and their
variety. And the food which I feel inclined towards accordingly. One of
the most refreshing of all vegetables is a cucumber. Cucumber is often
dismissed as being fit for not much else besides garnishing. What a
waste.
Cut open a cucumber and smell it -- it has a most distinct fragrance.
I know that some people think that cucumber is indigestible, but I'm
sure that is because of the seeds that run down the centre, and for many
recipes these can be scooped out.
I use cucumber as a flavour and texture contrast in a filling for a
dill or watercress roulade, when smoked salmon or trout is the main item
of the filling. There is no fear of the cucumber making the filling
watery, because I cut the cucumber into chunks, cut each chunk in half,
then scoop out the seeds before slicing into fine dice. It's the seeds
that seep their liquid, so that removes that potential hazard. When I
use cucumber in this way I peel it, and this takes about two seconds if
you zip down the skin using a potato peeler to cut it away. But often
the contrast between the dark skin and the pale green flesh is what
makes a dish using cucumber look so attractive.
These days you can use cucumber skin without any fear that it might be
bitter, as used to be the case before the bitter tendency was bred out.
Some homegrown cucumbers can have rather tough skins, so if you grow
your own cut off a bit and chew it before using it with its skin.
Cucumber makes a very good vegetable served hot, especially as an
accompaniment to light meats, like chicken and pork, and all fish. I
peel off the skin, and cut the cucumbers into finger-thick bits about 2"
long, then saute them gently in butter. You can stir in a grating of
lemon rind, depending what you are serving it with. Cucumber cooked like
this keeps warm without spoiling, for up to half an hour.
If you want to use cucumber as a garnish, and this will most probably
be for cold salmon, you need slices which are wafer thin. The only way
to achieve uniformly transparent-thin slices is to use a mandolin --
unless you have a very steady hand, and a great deal of patience. As I'm
incapable of slicing an evenly thick slice of bread, never mind a very
thin slice of cucumber, and as I'm also a bit deficient in the patience
stakes, a mandolin is an essential part of my kitchen equipment. It may
seem an extravagance, but there is so much other slicing and julienning
to be done with a good mandolin that it very soon earns its keep.
Sliced cucumber, by the way, is an excellent and most soothing remedy
for tired eyes, if you have a spare 10 minutes to put your feet up while
you lay the cool cucumber slices over your eyes.
But back to the garnishing; the problem with cucumber slices is that
they tend to dry out, and as they are laid in overlapping layers over a
skinned fish, their attraction wanes rather as they curl up. But this
can be overcome in two ways: either you can brush them very carefully
with oil -- sunflower or olive; or you can brush them with a cooled and
almost jelling lemon aspic. You may need to repeat the aspic brushing
once or twice. For garnishing like this, you can have the slices with
their skin on, or off. I think I prefer the skin on, which gives a faint
dark green rim to each slice.
Cucumber goes very well with mint. My favourite mint is the broad
leaved furry textured apple mint -- it has by far the superior flavour,
and the furriness vanishes as soon as the mint is chopped or cooked. A
delicious cool summer soup is made from grating the cucumber, skin and
all, finely, then mixing this with half strained chicken stock and half
creme fraiche, with finely chopped mint stirred through along with the
grated cucumber. Season with salt and pepper.
Grated cucumber is the basis for this mousse recipe. It is combined
with plenty of fresh dill, chopped, and it is a refreshing and
exquisitely flavoured mousse, just ideal for eating on a warm day. It
makes the perfect accompaniment to cold salmon, or it can be a first
course.
Dill and Cucumber Mousse
(Serves 6-8)
2 good handfuls of chopped dillweed
2 cucumbers, their ends cut off, the cucumbers cut in half lengthways
and their seeds scooped out, then the halves (with their skins on)
grated, quite finely
1 large pot creme fraiche, the creamy kind, not the reduced-fat type.
This pot contains 500ml which is just less than 1 pint
2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons finely snipped chives
1 teaspoon caster sugar, [1/2] teaspoon salt, a good grinding of
pepper, [1/2] pint chicken stock
1 sachet gelatine -- [1/2] oz
2 egg whites
MEASURE half the stock into a saucepan and sprinkle in the gelatine.
Over gentle heat shake the pan until the granules dissolve completely.
Stir in the rest of the cold stock and leave to cool completely. Stir
the sugar and wine vinegar into the grated cucumber, and mix this
together with the dillweed, chives and the salt and pepper, and the
cooled gelatine and stock. Leave until it is just beginning to gel, then
fold in the creme fraiche. Lastly, whisk the whites until stiff, and
with a large metal spoon fold them thoroughly through the cucumber and
creme fraiche mixture. Pour this into a serving dish. Garnish, if you
like, with dill, or with chopped prawns.
* Lady Claire Macdonald is giving a demonstration in Killearn Village
Hall on Wednesday, June 21. Tickets, price #25, are available from Jane
Wilson, Country Kitchen, Heron's Court, Killearn, by Glasgow, G63 9PZ,

Stephen McGinty and photographer Mike Wilkinson begin an occasional
series looking at the lives of the denizens of Scotland's most famous
thoroughfares with a reflection on the experiences of those who populate
Princes Street, the capital's pride and joy
HE WAS a 6ft vision in a white stetson wrapped with a silver band and
furnished with a cow-horn brooch, red leather cowboy boots, and a belt
buckle as big as John Wayne's fist. Marching across the roof of the
Waverley Centre he hollered at the two pipers: ''Excuse me, sirs, may I
take your pictures?''
Soon the ''little lady'' was positioned beside Albert Whitelaw and
Harry Jamieson as they both blew hard on Scotland the Brave while the
American's antique camera softly click-clicked.
Afterwards he sort of introduced himself. ''Hell, I can't get anybody
to sell me my goddam clan tartan. I'm a Baird, first name Charlie after
the Bonnie Prince.''
It turned out that Charlie Baird from El Paso, Texas, had served at
Prestwick Airport with the American Air Force and was returning after 50
years. After throwing a pound coin in the pipers' pouch he swaggered off
with his wife, not a prince but definitely The Duke.
''Aye, the Americans are all right,'' said Harry. ''So are the
Japanese but the French are really tight!''
Princes Street, not on a wet Saturday afternoon but a warm
bank-holiday Monday, and Albert and Harry, in tight tweed jackets and
kilts, are playing for the tourists. The piped renditions of The Old
Rustic Bridge and The Green Hills of Tyrone make them between #17-#20
each.
But every little helps Harry, a low-waged forester with a city
hospital. Last year he started piping on this pitch at weekends. Albert
in comparison is a veteran, playing since 1985, and he has five years
with the Rev Alan Chapman under his sporran.
''Now he was a character till he died of a heart-attack in '91. Had
the first one on the No 77 bus halfway up the Mound, but it was the
second one that killed him. He used to wear a saltire as a shirt. The
pair of us piped at the corner of St John's and when a crowd gathered
he'd preach. I had to quit at the end when he was almost fighting with
the other preachers about God.''
William Burke wanders around within earshot wearing his top hat,
jacket, and a pistol stuck down his breeches, but he wishes he wasn't.
''Those are the worst pipers I've ever heard,'' said Scott Anderson, 22,
alias the bodysnatcher, who now hands out Ghost Tour leaflets, 200 a day
to Russian, French, and Italian tourists.
''They actually do versions of Jesus Christ Superstar -- on the
pipes,'' he adds in amazement. Scott said he quit a business degree at
Glasgow's Caledonia University and now works in a city bar. He loves the
city, loves the street, and likes the way you can sometimes pick up
women on the tours.
On a fag break he waves his hand. ''It's a great city and what a
street!''
* PRINCES Street has character and characters. The first, of course,
directly proportionate to the second. To Anthony Pernoso, the American
lawyer who pasted pictures of his lost sweetheart Vera up and down its
length, it's a boulevard of broken dreams. For ''Postcard'' Harry
Tranter, who retires this autumn after 50 years running a stall, it's
just a neighbourhood street clogged with a thousand friends. And to
Kizer The Comedian, an alcoholic down'n'out, it's the road to nowhere.
Princes Street runs like an artery through Edinburgh's heart. Just
over one mile long and sandwiched between Waterloo Place in the east and
Shandwick Place in the west, it commands stunning views of the gardens
and castle. Around the world, streets are little more than rivers for
pedestrians through concrete canyons -- but Princes Street has more.
It might not have been. In 1771, 50 years after the street was built,
a debate raged over building plans for the south side of the street.
However, the men in three-cornered hats, long-skirted coats,
knee-breeks, and silver-buckled shoes who had moved from their poor
neighbours in the Old Town had no desire to see them return. The plans
were squashed, though it was decades before the Nor' Loch was drained
and the gardens cultivated.
Back in the future it's easy to lose the street's characters in the
throng of 70,000 pedestrians, 44,000 bus passengers and a further 8000
vehicles daily driving its length. Those from the past such as Thomas
Guthrie, preacher and philanthropist who risked typhus epidemics to open
schools for the poor, have a head start. He and his companions, such as
Sir James Young Simpson, who pioneered anaesthesia, are commemorated in
statues gazing down upon the street. To find today's inhabitants you
have to look a little harder.
Harry Tranter has for 50 years sold postcards on the corner of Princes
Street and Waverley Bridge. Every morning the 85-year-old arrives
wearing two shirts, a suit jacket and a long coat. In this his final
year he plans to organise a petition to have the Scott Monument
demolished. ''I deserve a little sun on my bones,'' he said, while his
head gently nods, a legacy to Parkinson's disease.
He took the pitch during the summer season after VE Day. A printer to
trade, he managed war work preparing invasion maps, before losing the
use of one eye. Half a century has rolled past his little stall and
vanished like the trams. He said the shops are the biggest difference.
''All those wonderful old shops now in the hands of cheap-jacks. It's
terrible.''
Today he has two grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, none of
whom has any plans to take over his pitch. Though his earnings are
small, they have paid for holidays in Italy, Morocco, and America while
tourists from around the world have sent cards addressed to Harry
Tranter, c/o Princes Street. ''I've met some of the nicest people on
God's earth on this spot -- I wouldn't trade it for anything, but I
think it's time to go.''
Every morning across the street, newspaper vendor Fran McCraw shouts,
''Right! Right!'' out of the window of her Fuji trailer to the young
blind man who strides purposely towards her billboards. Having heard, he
always turns in time, just one of the hundreds whose lives are touched
by 49-year-old ''Aunt Fran'', whose pitch sits opposite the Balmoral
Hotel 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
During her six-year residence she's survived three court actions and
an attack by a gang of three youths wielding aerosol cans. Her #8000
trailer would have eaten her annual salary had it not been donated by
the firm Spacetrailers and Fuji film for promotional use. ''This is the
only job I've stuck at. When I was young I'd go through two or three
jobs a day, I couldn't stand people telling me what to do, I would tell
them to bugger off.'' She is always polite to her customers, though, who
have included Ian Lang, and Jimmy Crickett. ''He said I had a lovely
smiley face.''
The artists of Princes Street do not favour the wide flagstones beside
the National Gallery. Too much competition, perhaps, from the oils and
canvas of the dead. Instead on a sunny afternoon amid the shoppers'
hustle opposite Waverley Station young people like Sean Naughton display
spray-painted stencils, taped to the pavement.
An attractive yet anonymous Edinburgh girl stares up from behind a
curtain of black hair in a pavement gallery populated by Cher, Clint
Eastwood, and Andy Warhol's rendition of Marilyn Monroe. Just someone
Sean saw and liked. He's not a real artist, chemistry is his field, but
despite sending off as many as 2200 job applications he still can't find
employment.
He graduated at Stirling University in 1980 with a 2.2 Honours degree
which he followed up with an MSc in Chemistry at Cork University in 1993
after three years of homelessness and part-time work. In Ireland he
worked as a chemist for #3 an hour but was forced to quit after he
walked in leaky boots through some spilt potassium hydroxide.
He's been in Edinburgh for two months staying with a friend and
attending the Job Club. Between 1.30pm and 4pm he'll earn seven quid or
so. As we talk, a couple of kids arrive.
''How much for the Cher one?''
''Give me three quid?
''I'll give you two quid.''
''OK.''
* YOU'LL find Kizer The Comedian most days on the pedestrian walkway
at the Royal Scottish Academy with his family Bones, Fraggle Ally,
Tweeky, and Keith with his little kid, Jack. Four-year-old Jack is
running round making airplane noises and wearing little red shorts, the
collar of his T-shirt neatly folded over his warm brown jumper.
In contrast his father has his head shaved with a dozen earrings in
each ear. The tattered combat fatigues and slashed T-shirts don't quite
cover all the tattoos that crawl over his arms to his hand which holds
the leash of Jay the dog.
Jack is well looked after. Every time Fraggle Ally or Tweeky get a
carry-out of big bottles of MD20-20, Carlsberg Special Brew, and strong
cider, he gets a 99 cone and a chewy bar. Then he goes back to playing
while Keith, his dad, keeps a watchful eye. ''I'm not with these guys,
like, I live with my mum in Leith,'' said Keith, who's paying a visit to
his second family. Almost everyone is dressed in worn army fatigues,
their hair is knotted in dreads, and multiple rings pierce ears, noses,
and eyelids. Kizer, the patriarch of this moving grunge mob, explains
how he got his name.
''I went to the social security and they asked if I had any savings.
'Six hundred pounds,' I said. 'You're joking?' said the guy. 'Aye, well,
you started it,' I said.''
A few laugh but the story Kizer tells next isn't nearly as funny. Now
36, he's spent his life on the streets, a habitual drunk since the age
of 14. He says he's been resident in a host of approved schools,
Glenochil and Clackmannanshire Young Offenders' Institutions, plus
Peterhead, Perth, and Shotts Prisons.
Kizer says he has aunts at Stockbridge and the Meadows with #110,000
homes but no-one wants to know, including his mother, whom he insists he
loves. Fraggle Ally, 28, said he left his native Thurso to look after
his granny in Leith. At 14 he lost the house when she died and so ran
away from care. Just then . . . beer rises into the air, the dogs are
snarling and trying to bite each other, a leash tug settles them down.
They're handy protection against the young casuals, who often target
this close team.
At night, tramps and the homeless are the characters in the stories of
the street. Many people talk of an old man laden with Marks &amp; Spencer
bags crammed with paper who wanders up and down. His background is still
a mystery, as any attempt at communication brings a violent outburst of
gibberish. Another man with matted hair, beard, and almost black-brown
face whom people had mistaken for an Aborigine was actually Arthur from
Stornoway, though he would say no more.
About 9pm 18-year-old Ian sits in a shop doorway at the corner of
Frederick Street. He fled Fife a month ago when the drug dealer who
supplied him with speed, ecstasy, and hash said he planned to break his
kneecaps in lieu of a debt. Ian has teamed up with Frank from
Springburn, who ran away because his mother hated his fiancee.
Both are easy prey for those who threaten a kicking or stabbing for
the sake of a couple of quid. ''We just cough up,'' said Ian.
Seventy-three degrees descend on the city the following afternoon.
Princes Street Gardens become littered with sunbathing office workers,
pensioners, and lovers. While Paris revolves round the iconic image of
Robert Doisneau and the swift kiss caught in a crowded street, the
romantics of these gardens can afford to take their time.
A blonde in a long gingham dress lolls on top of her boyfriend on the
grass opposite the fountain. No-one seems to notice when she slips up
her dress and he pulls off his belt, nor when they begin to rock, then
roll. Everyone's more interested in their ice-cream, paperbacks, and
miniature-golf games. Here it is hot, balmy, and people are having fun.
Back on the street, Georg Rolshoven and Alex Horning are buskers. Both
18 and from Munchengladbach in Germany, they are playing Maple Leaf Rag
and Makin' Whoopee while the bus driver, taking them home after a 10-day
tour of the Highlands, sleeps. ''We love playing and we thought we'd
earn some money,'' said Georg in embarrassingly accurate English.
With Georg on sax and Alex strumming guitar, the pedestrians walk by
occasionally tossing a coin. The sun continues to shine and Princes
Street, in all it's concrete splendour, glints and gleams.

AS his name really Ed Wood? Or was that just an unflattering
description? Hitherto known only to diehard trash cultists and
playground-bully critics like the compilers of the Golden Turkey awards,
the 1950s master of no-budget Z-features like Glen Or Glenda? and Bride
Of The Monster will soon be better known through long-time fan Tim
Burton's biopic Ed Wood, starring Johnny Depp as the maverick auteur
who, in the words of the Monty Python song, liked to put on women's
clothing and hang around in bars.
Even if that film proves a hit -- and Tim Burton hasn't had a flop yet
-- it's at least debatable whether Wood's own weird, incompetent, yet
oddly compelling movies will gain much of a popularity spin-off, except
that limited to the kind traditionally enjoyed by the Bearded Lady in
the circus.
Pickwick Video, at any rate, seem willing to take a chance on it,
releasing no less than six of Wooden Ed's films between now and June 19.
The first tranche of terror comprises Jailbait (1954), a gangster noir
based on the common 1930s theme of Public Enemies getting their faces
changed by plastic surgery; Night Of The Ghouls (1957) -- a phoney
medium gets his comeuppance from the ''real'' spirits -- and Wood's best
(or at least most notorious) movie, Plan Nine From Outer Space (1955;
all retail at #9.99, cert PG/15).
Named as the worst film ever made as often as Citizen Kane is named as
the best, Plan Nine From Outer Space -- so retitled by the distributors
to Wood's great disgust: he thought Grave Robbers From Outer Space was a
far better title -- is admittedly a deeply eccentric and unprofessional
picture, but not without some points of interest.
Recycling the popular 1950s theme of alien invaders planning to wipe
out the sinful, warlike folks of Earth to keep the universe safe for
alienkind -- it is typical of Wood's style that they plan to do this by
resurrecting the dead to kill the living -- Wood creates an atmosphere
of horror that, perhaps by accident as much as design, is more
disturbing than that of any professionally made drive-in
girlfriend-frightener of its period.
Because it can't be read like a proper film -- the narrative,
dialogue, and editing are all over the place -- it has the illogical,
unsettling quality of nightmare and madness.
If it weren't so likely to get Couch Potato into Pseuds' Corner, we'd
say it reminded us strongly of the Soviet surrealist shorts of the
1920s.
Stars, for want of a better word, are Wood's usual coterie of
grotesques: TV horror host Vampira, wrestler Tor Johnson, Criswell the
''forecaster'', and poor old Bela Lugosi -- who actually died a few days
before shooting began, but that's another story.
And now, back to the land of the living. Airheads (rental, cert 15),
which for purposes of shorthand could be described as Spinal Tap meets
Dumb And Dumber meets Dog Day Afternoon, is a daft but very likeable
rock 'n' roll farce. Brendan Fraser, Adam Sandler, and Steve Buscemi (Mr
Pink out of Reservoir Dogs) are a loser LA rock group which, in a last
bid for stardom, break in to the local radio station and hold repulsive
DJ Joe Mantegna at gunpoint (with water pistols) to make him broadcast
their demo tape.
The tape gets accidentally destroyed, but they've gone to all this
trouble anyway, so what the heck . .  why stop now? Not exactly Citizen
Kane (nor even Plan Nine From Outer Space), but good silly laddish fun,
a real Saturday-night beer 'n' pizza special.

WHEN Scotland's gallant rugby team failed in their Grand Slam bid on
that bleak March day at Twickenham, they were not least helped, as some
commentators would have it, by a referee on whose hip was etched a rose
and in whose whistle was planted a fresh pea. The gloom did not easily
lift, even by these unlikely truths. However, another team, only a
Hastings' penalty kick distant from Murrayfield, has completed a grand
slam of a kind. And they might even be called a pub team. Hail
Caledonian.
Caledonian Brewery has gone one better than the hat-trick and its
Deuchars IPA has been voted four times in a row the best beer in the
country by the Glasgow and West of Scotland branch of CAMRA.
Branch meetings are held monthly, and although an indelicate
observation may be that their assemblage resembles a Weightwatchers
masterclass, the business on hand does command a certain gravity.
Members have one vote each month for their favourite beer, but their
discipline is such that they may not vote for the same beer twice in a
row.
At the end of each meeting votes are put into a sealed envelope and
are not opened until the twelfth and final month's votes have been cast.
The system is fiendishly clever and provides an accurate guide to a
beer's consistency over the year without involving a tasting panel to
try a product that may have been ''doctored''.
But for Cellarman it was forward and eastwards to the birthplace of
this record-winner. From Haymarket Station the nose picked up the scent
and led the way into and along Dalry Road, where an instinctive left
then a right into Slateford Road saw the snug chimney so resplendent of
Victorian factory architecture peaking its head above the hollow in
which the brewery's rambling buildings lay.
Caledonian Brewery was founded in 1869 when it was one of 30 breweries
in the city. Edinburgh had a reputation for producing beers of the
finest quality, and the youthful Caledonian quickly gained in stature
among its fellows, no doubt helped by its resources of crystal-clear
well water. Apart from acquiring a few wrinkles and the odd grey hair,
this 126-year-old is still enjoying life to the full. A daily elixir in
some quantity of barley, water, hops and yeast has given chase to
ailments that have put those less fortunate behind walking frames.
In the brewery's sample room, above and beside which the gurgle,
splash, roll, and clank of everyday work surrounds, dipping pelicans,
flash mirrors and illuminated signs are absent. Stone-floor cool, the
room is humbly enlivened by wooden tables and chairs and a rack of
caskettes down one wall contain the brewery's lifeblood.
It is here that our rugby team has particular empathy, and despite the
odd king dropping in for a pint, it is more acquainted with discussions
of significant national importance.
Caledonian's managing director and head brewer, Russell Sharp, is a
man born to brew, but even with his brewery's growing success he does
not permit himself the extravagance of complacency. His hops may come
from fields separated by oceans, or the barley may be grown beside the
No 37 bus route, but when he crumbles the hop flowers between his hands,
releasing the aromas therein, or noses the air above the maturation
tanks, his actions are those of a master brewer, a man at work and
enjoying every minute.
The brewery's buildings are connected by a network of stairways and
catwalks that go up, down, along, across, and over the brewing process.
One of the company's longest-serving employees is an open-fired copper
which has been boiling malt and infusing hops since 1869. Beside are two
much younger coppers, both with a healthy appetite for hops.
To pass through the brewery is to pass through more than 100 years of
brewing history. Evidence of the past and its machinery and systems make
frequent appearances. An air-conditioning system used by Victorians has
its own effective simplicity. Blocks of ice in the basement were fanned
over and the chilled air was driven up through a series of channels and
flus to ventilation slats in the hop store, where the cool air kept the
crop fresh.
There have been setbacks, however, and last year a fire was within a
hop hair of razing the brewery to ashes. Although damage was
considerable, the coppers were boiling a brew within seven days,
christened Phoenix to celebrate its return.
Some rebuilding has been necessary after the fire, and commencing in
July, new maltings, racking system and a heritage centre will be part of
the #2m investment which should see work completed by April. Brewery
tours comparable with those current to the whisky distillery will be
very much a part of Caledonian's future.
Russell Sharp has created a strong portfolio of beers which are a
credit to him and his team. From those early days of 60/- and 70/- to
the flagship Caledonian 80/-, the company has moved on through Merman
XXX, Edinburgh Strong Ale, and Caledonian Porter. Golden Promise was
Britain's first organic beer, and to this has been added a lighter
version, Golden Pale.
But Deuchars IPA is the brewery's multi-award winner. It is styled on
the hoppy brews originally intended for India and the colonies. Late
hopped, it is a beer with distinctive aroma and flavour. This best beer
in Scotland will be the country's representative at the Great British
Beer Festival at London's Olympia in July. We hope the tasting panel is
completely without side.

Grand Prix, Teenage Fanclub (Creation)
* THEY are back, these masters of gutsy guitar-propelled melody. And
so as fervent tune-lovers, we must all kneel at TFC's molten plectra,
worshipping and weeping for joy. Having first scooted to the nearest
record-vendor to buy this 13-song gem, of course. If the Faces hadn't
been disfigured by an outbreak of Rod Stewart; if the Byrds had had a
bit more dig; if the wondrous Crabby Appleton were still alive and
well... even if all these things had come to pass, Teenage Fanclub would
still be the groovimost.
The Best Of The Hits, the Chi-Lites (Charly)
* I FREQUENTLY dream of being on stage at Glasgow's Royal Concert
Hall, tearfully emoting my way through the baroque'n'soul intricacies of
a 30-minute ambient dub version of Have You Seen Her, backed by the Blue
Nile. This is followed by my sob-wracked version of Oh Girl which has a
rapt crowd simultaneously weeping. Until my dream comes true, however,
we must be content with this 19-track demonstration of the melodramatic
genius of head Chi-Lite Eugene Record.
You Must Ask The Heart, Jonathan Richman (Rounder)
* MORE priceless pop'n'roll from Mr Richman, the ageless Dean of Teen.
Sometimes he's as bouncy as a puppy; sometimes his voice is as
melancholy as the cold north wind and he sings solely to assuage his
aching heart. To hear him is to love him. Neat original songs -- Let Her
Go Into The Darkness, City Vs Country and the brooding album title-track
are worth the price of admission on their own -- and cool covers (Sam
Cooke's Nothing Can Change This Love and Tom Waits' The Heart Of
Saturday Night).
Sunpowder, the Bathers (Marina)
* THE epic sound of one man alone -- alone, that is, apart from the
potent plangency of sundry stringed instruments and Liz Fraser's haunted
tones --  in a disturbingly-beautiful wilderness of sound, breathily
unravelling his psyche as he attempts the impossible: the celebratory
exploration of love's mysteries. Blimey, that's one way of putting it,
mush. But don't let me put you off. Experience the inestimable Chris
Thomson for yourself.
DAVID BELCHER
Canticles of Ecstasy, Sequentia (Deutsche Harmonia Mundi)
* RAPT, exquisite, hypnotic, and quite extraordinary disc of
twelfth-century compositions by the abbess Hildegard von Bingen. This
amazing lady -- a visionary, saint, writer and healer -- was also a
composer who claimed divine inspiration for her music. And it sounds it
in this mesmeric performance by the group Sequentia, who have made
something of a specialism of her music. The disc makes a perfect
companion to James MacMillan's rather more recent spiritual masterpiece,
The Seven Last Words.
Music of Kevin Volans, The Duke Quartet (Collins Classics)
* SOUTH-African born Volans has made the string quartet his own in the
past decade. His fifth and latest quartet -- Dancers on a Plane -- is
one of his finest, and looks back to his so-called African period. It is
an intensely atmospheric piece which marries music for the group
(stunning performance by the Dukes) with natural sounds: recordings from
the African landscape. Works brilliantly.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Misty Morning and No Time, Tommy Smith (Linn)
* INSPIRED by Norman McCaig's poems, these 14 splendid compositions
mark a new maturity in Smith's writing and caused raised eyebrows when
the charts were shown around in London musicians' circles. Some of the
more boisterous items are no doubt devilishly difficult to play but Guy
Barker (trumpet), Julian Arguelles (alto sax) and Smith (tenor) render
them all easily digestible with admirable support from the rhythm
section.
Joe Cool's Blues, Wynton and Ellis Marsalis (Columbia)
* A TRIBUTE to the Peanuts cartoons by Marsalis Junior's septet and
Senior's trio, with the latter augmented to an octet on Little Birdie,
the only vocal. Wynton's originals and Vince Guaraldi's six tunes from
the TV adaptations capture all the emotions from disappointment to
jubilation, creating childlike simplicity with adult expertise, and
though the musicians stay well within their Crescent City comfort zones,
they play with obvious affection and no little charm.

JUST why half the population should choose to semi-garrotte itself
every morning is one of life's milder mysteries. Ties may be a fairly
recent invention but they remain essential garb for the conformist,
job-holding, male.
Perhaps because there is so little room for self-expression in men's
dress, the tie is a little beacon of individual taste. It can be a
symbol of aesthetic judgment, a gesture of defiance, a clue to social or
group status -- for many men at heart are pack people. What else
explains the rather pathetic wearing of old school or regimental ties
decades after contact with the institutions involved has ended?
The true Brit taste for institutional ties will no doubt survive.
Fashions otherwise change. The shoe-string alternates with the kipper,
with the predictability of rising and falling skirt hems.
The fashionable width at the moment seems to be a semi-kipper. Silk is
the chosen fabric. Not only do patterns print well on it but the tie
itself hangs well, not fighting its owner as he attempts a Windsor knot.
There are plenty of handsome designs on the market, from the big chain
shops such as Marks and Spencer and British Home Stores to specialised
emporia such as the Tie Rack.
The latter has responded to VE-Day nostalgia by producing some special
ties. The one with the VE crest (available, like many of the firm's
designs, with green, blue, and red backgrounds) is too fussy for my
taste -- but another, showing biplanes bedecked with the RAF's red,
white, and blue bull's-eye, scored a hit with my birthday teenager.
M and S have such a fine range of silk ties that the days of polyester
are surely numbered. The current designs tend to be in abstract blocks
of colour -- with reds, beiges, blacks, blues and navy to the fore. They
are assertive without being overwhelming.
One of last year's models in vertical lozenges of blue, red, and raw
sienna was an absolute winner. I know this by observation. Not only did
my household own one (contended for by the two males on nights out) but
there were several to be spotted in the office, adorning a variety of
necks from sportswriters' to photographers'. that's the problem with
chain-store purchases, however ideal -- you can't expect to be
exclusive.
Sartorially, male journalists are hardly the cynosure of neighbouring
eyes. They may, on the other hand, be a typical bunch of Scotsmen.
Tie-wise what do my near colleagues opt for? Musical Michael wears none
at all, even at concerts. Roy leads opinion with a nice line in flying
ducks and flamboyant floral designs from BHS (all silk).
Willie, a quietly nonconformist spirit, often wears the stylised
flowers of Liberty, again in silk. Systems-expert Sandy has a Paisley
pattern number, black on red, in polyester. Artist Roy often juxtaposes
a heliotrope tie with dark shirt. Business-desk Brian (who once swapped
a Rangers tie for a prime ministerial Chelsea one) strikes back with
Mickey Mouse or Stars and Stripes when Wall Street looms.
So, personality will out -- though one suspects that most ties are
actually bought by the wearers' womenfolk!

Ken Gallacher reviews a book that goes behind the scenes of the Big
Band era, with some rare insights into life on the road
JIMMY MAXWELL spent four years as lead trumpeter in the Benny Goodman
Orchestra from 1939 to 1943. He recalls: ''Playing with Benny Goodman
was an unbelievable experience. It was the most famous band in the
country. When we played at the Paramount Theatre in New York people
would line up the night before and sleep on the sidewalk to get into the
show the next day.
''I had never had an experience like that. The best way I can explain
it to people nowadays is to say that it was like being with the Beatles.
It was the same kind of reception; everybody knew who you were. One day
I was an unknown trumpet player and the next year all the magazine polls
rated me third or fourth best in the country, just because I was in
Benny's band.''
His recollections come from a book written by Sheila Tracy, entitled
Bands, Booze and Broads. Tracy played trombone herself in Ivy Benson's
all-girl band, and has been presenting BBC Radio's Big Band Special for
the past 16 years.
In the book she takes you behind the scenes of the Big Band era. She
gives some rare insights into the life the musicians led on the road,
and provides pen portraits of the leaders at that time. There are
anecdotes about Tommy Dorsey, Goodman, Woody Herman, Duke Ellington, and
almost all of the others who made that period in American music so
lively.
There are contrasting views of all of them, especially Goodman, who
comes off particularly badly: not as a musician -- no-one can ever
criticise his clarinet playing -- but as a human being.
Maxwell tells the story of how he was fired from the band. He recalls:
''I was fired from Benny's band on account of Duke Ellington. I said to
him 'You know, as long as you use arrangements from Basie and other
bands, from black arrangers, why don't you get some arrangements from
Duke? These are really good'.
''He asked, 'Do you like that band?' I told him it was the greatest
and asked him if he thought the same. He said, 'No. I kind of think my
band is,' and I said, 'Well, I think Duke is'.''
Eventually Goodman asked Maxwell who his favourite clarinet player was
and the trumpeter named Ellington's clarinetist Barney Bigard. Half an
hour later the band manager called Maxwell aside and told him Benny
wanted to speak to him. The interview was short and less than sweet.
Said Goodman: ''You know, Pops, I don't think I want anyone in my band
who doesn't think we're the best, so I'm going to have to put you on
notice.''
Trombonist Tommy Dorsey could, at times, be as mean as Goodman.
Trumpeter Bernie Privin described him as ''a pain in the neck''. But
Dorsey had more redeeming features than his rival. He was a hard
taskmaster, a perfectionist, but if he liked a musician then that man
would be looked after.
I can remember the tenor saxophonist Bud Freeman telling me how Dorsey
gave him greater exposure as a soloist than any other band leader. The
reason was simple, Dorsey used to stand in the wings enjoying Freeman's
playing as much as the audience did.
And the trumpeter Yank Lawson, poached from the Bob Crosby band, was
never placed on salary by Tommy. Instead, Yank simply asked for money
whenever he felt he needed it. It was, he would recall, the best-paying
job he ever had.
Sheila Tracy has managed to talk to many musicians in the book, but
there are omissions. Somehow she gives just two pages to the Bob Crosby
Band, and nothing at all to Jimmy Lunceford; and the chapter on Duke
Ellington is short on information from the giants who played with him.
Only drummer Louie Bellson can be looked on as a Ducal regular. Still,
there is one notable insider's view of an Ellington recording session
when Duke was working on the score for Frank Sinatra's movie Assault On
The Queen.
Studio musicians in Hollywood were asked to join Duke for the session,
and trombonist Milt Bernhart tells in the book how surprised they were
at the way Ellington operated. He says: ''Duke gave a strip of paper to
each player of eight bars. On it was just this eight-bar riff, no score,
and I'm sure he wrote out the parts in his hotel room.
''I couldn't understand it and before the take started I walked over
to the piano and said to him: 'Besides the eight bars, what are we going
to do?' He looked at me and his words are etched forever in my psyche:
'You'll know.'
''Talk about a revelation! Nobody was cued. Everything went
immaculately. It was quite remarkable because we had recorded something
very presentable that would have taken some arrangers weeks to get into
their minds. Ellington was the boss, but he never told anybody what to
do, ever.''
As regards the ''booze'' in the title, trumpeter Johnny Best, who
played with Goodman, Artie Shaw, and just about everyone else admits:
''I do things when I'm drinking that I wouldn't try to do if I was
sober. I've got recordings that today, when I listen to them, I think,
'How did I do that?' Hitting notes that I couldn't even hit an octave
lower now. But it helped me. I coped with my nerves by drinking Scotch,
and that's the plain truth.''
But the story about John Best's drinking exploits, and my favourite,
isn't in the book. Once, out on the road with the Artie Shaw band, the
trumpeter staggered off the bus after an eight-hour journey and saw a
sign in the hotel which said -- ''Happy Hour, all you can drink for a
dollar.''
Best, exhausted after the journey and knowing he had to play again
that night, walked up to the bar and said: ''Give me two dollars'
worth.'' That story isn't told but hundreds of others are, in a book
which captures the era and the musicians perfectly.
The book is published by Mainstream, costs #17.50, and is worth every
penny.

SCOTLAND -- THE BRAND:
The Making of Scottish Heritage
David McCrone, Angela Morris, and Richard Kiely
Edinburgh University Press, #12.95
THE number of visits to ''heritage'' attractions in Scotland in 1992
was 31.5m -- more than six times the size of the population. This might
suggest that Scotland's past has become a burden on its present.
And among the questions addressed in this, one of the first systematic
examinations of our heritage industry, is whether the persistent, and
for some oppressive, habit of the world at large of identifying the
country by the emblems of its past occurs ''because it has a past, but
not a present or a future''. It will, it is argued, become progressively
less easy to separate issues of heritage from political issues within a
stateless nation.
Four themes are pursued throughout the book: heritage as a commodity,
its consumption, the political dimension, and the ideology associated
with it. Special emphasis is placed on the comparatively neglected
second, on the grounds, certainly correct, that the way in which the
phenomenon is received and ''consumed'' is at least as important as the
manner in which it is manufactured and presented.
The approaches of the three institutions which represent what might be
called three different cultural levels of engagement with national
heritage -- the Scottish Tourist Board, Historic Scotland, and the
National Trust for Scotland -- are, together with the role of the gentry
in the stately homes business, analysed from these various perspectives.
There follows a study of what heritage means for one specific group --
life members of the NTS. The book concludes with speculations on the
relation of heritage to national identity and some of the political and
ideological implications.
The account of the crass commercial vulgarity of the STB approach, for
which Scotland is a ''brand'' to be marketed, and the Cairngorms a
''product'', makes depressing reading.
More stimulating, if no less depressing, is the analysis of the
pressures upon Historic Scotland to take a more populist stance, which
at its worst involves moving from the language of sober technical
description to the use of advertisements featuring talking gargoyles.
The authors associate these pressures with the emergence of a new and
vast ''service class'' which values heritage as an emblem of the
education to which it owes its social mobility, but seeks in the past a
sense of relevance to the present which is satisfied only by an elusive
''magic of the real'', an authenticity which cannot be other than
spurious.
What the authors call the ''passive tourism'' of the past was, in
reality, far more active than the present vogue for ''interpretive''
spoonfeeding and counterfeit participation, in that it demanded the
active use of the imagination, through which the observer created value
and meaning from the material remains, without subduing them.
It could be argued that the contemporary tourist mentality is
damagingly acquisitive, in that it demands that the past should be
conformable to our own experience, and so seeks to appropriate and
domesticate it, denying that what has gone before us is inalienable
otherness.
Telling points are made on the political dimension: heritage acquires
a political agenda, often concealed in apparently anodyne ministerial
statements, insofar as it serves the function of defining the periphery
to the centre rather than vice versa.
It has also helped the aristocracy and landed gentry to carve a new
role for themselves in hostile times through the stately homes industry,
as self-appointed guardians of the national inheritance.
Though the authors express some surprise at the results of their
interview survey of life members of the NTS, these would seem to be
entirely predictable by commonsense. Given the conservative nature of
this group, its average age of 59, and the well-established tendency of
such Scots to proclaim a dual national identity (Scottish and British),
it scarcely comes as a surprise that their consciousness of heritage
shows no positive correlation with political nationalism. No more is it
surprising that a strong sense of identity is mediated by their
engagement with the material and cultural remains of the national past.
This book steers a sensible middle course ideologically, successfully
evading the barren reefs of post-modernism. It is a pity that its
standards of grammar, spelling, and general expression are so lamentably
poor; and astonishing that a university press should allow so many
solecisms, deformed sentences, and semantic incoherences to pass
uncorrected.

FROM the beautifully bleak extremities of the Shetland Isles to the
built-up, semi-urbanised developments of east Sussex and Kent, the Fay
Godwin's Edge Of The Land (Jonathan Cape, #15) offers breathtaking and
wide-ranging examples of man's relationship, and cohabitation, with the
sea. This blend of stark, haunting, mesmerising panoramas confirms that,
despite massive pollution, land erosion and over fishing, our coastal
heritage survives.

THE LAST OF DEEDS and LOVE IN HISTORY. Eoin McNamee (Picador, #5.99).
* LOVE is the no-man's-land of a combat zone in both these novellas.
In The Last of Deeds, a provocative affair between the Catholic narrator
and an RUC man's daughter in a bleak Ulster fishing town sparks local
resentments literally into flame. In Love In History -- set around a
Second World War US air base -- the battleground is more personally
political, contested by local girls who dream of escape to America and
airmen who want only to forget their fears in bed and go home alive and
alone. Both stories are grim; less, it seems, out of a concern for
realism than from limitations of imagination.
THE WATER WORKS. E L Doctorow (Picador, #5.99).
* THE bustling, discursive, all-encompassing novel of the
pre-post-modernist age is alive and well in the head of American master
E L Doctorow, whose mad-scientist story The Waterworks is surely his
best book since Ragtime. The milieu of 1870s New York -- merciless and
mad for money and progress, ruled by robber-baron industrialists -- is
no mere prop background to the story. Rather it is the living metaphor
for Doctorow's theme -- a literal development of the old blues that says
If living was a thing that money could buy/ The rich would live and the
poor would die. Heartening reading.
NOW THE WAR IS OVER: A Social History of Britain 1945-1951. Paul
Addison (Pimlico, #10).
* 1945 was, in retrospect, a bad year for Labour to come into power.
Although the war was over, the price of victory dictated that for most
people hardship and shortage would continue to be a way of life. The
major industries may have been nationalised, but the social and cultural
establishment was still in the hands of Fabian ascetics and Tory
intellectuals to whom a holiday camp was on a par with Dachau. Paul
Addison's book shows great sympathy for the bossed-around British
proles.
NAKED AT THE FEAST: A Biography of Josephine Baker. Lynn Haney
(Robson, #10.99).
* DESPITE a breathless, gossipy style, Lynn Haney's biography of the
1920s song-and-dance queen -- the American Piaf, the black Judy Garland
-- conveys an exciting and sympathetic sense of the rush of her
high-speed, no-brakes life. Or lives, rather; Baker lived a dozen of
them between her poverty-stricken birth in St Louis, 1906, and her
bankrupt death in Paris, 1975.
ARMADILLOS AND OLD LACE. Kinky Friedman (Faber, #8.99).
* THE latest adventure of the author's fictional doppelganger, the
only Texan-Jewish Country-singing amateur detective in New York, finds
him back in the Lone Star state, solving the slaying of seven little old
ladies who long ago were all debutantes at the same high-society
cotillion. Or rather, just schlepping around and cracking wise until the
case solves itself by accident. Forget the crime and enjoy his company.

ALL sounds a tad cliched. Enjoy dinner in a restaurant that moves at
110mph, where the views change each time you glance up from your plate,
and waiters in crisp white shirts and bright red jackets attend to your
every need. It is the stuff of advertising campaigns -- it also happens
to be true.
Travel by train between Glasgow and Euston and you can eat dinner in
such surroundings. Add to the excellent service a menu which has been
designed to illustrate the best of Scottish produce and you have the
Taste of Scotland.
The menu was introduced on the InterCity West Coast line to offer
something different to regular travellers. But with an eye fixed very
firmly on the tourist market, it was also seen as a good chance to give
visitors to Scotland a taste of what to expect before they arrive. Or,
if they are leaving Scotland, a reminder of what they have left behind.
I travelled on a Glasgow-bound train during London's first heatwave of
the year. Taking my seat in the busy dining-car, I could almost have
been eating alfresco as the sun shone brilliantly and starched white
tablecloths gleamed. There is a choice of menus available. These cover
everything from a simple salad to a well-done steak. But I was here to
try the Taste of Scotland and the team of stewards seemed pleased that
so many others were joining me.
The Taste of Scotland menu is limited to one choice in each of the
three courses. The meal starts with soup, and there is a selection of
four which change on a regular basis. Pan-fried venison is served as a
main course. Beef and salmon are on the other menus which is why venison
was chosen. Dessert is clootie dumpling and custard.
Of the four soups available, Cullen Skink was being served when I
dined in the restaurant. The alternatives are Highlander's Broth, Scotch
Broth, and Cock-a-Leekie. Served in a china plate and piping hot, it was
enjoyable. There was a distinct lack of fish in the soup, but it had a
good flavour.
The service was brisk. Each dish was prepared to order in a tiny
kitchen, which had a tendency to shudder and was stiflingly hot, so the
main course quickly followed.
Venison is a meat which many people feel unsure about. Maybe they
expect it to taste strong and ''gamey'', and perceive it to be too
expensive. However, this is no longer the case. Indeed, we should
probably eat a lot more venison, not least because good venison is
hugely enjoyable, but also because it is a low-fat meat. It is also
widely available in butchers and supermarkets.
The venison used was Scottish and was farmed. It was served with a
rowanberry sauce and a selection of vegetables. The meat was lightly
pan-fried and tender with a delicate flavour, which was wonderfully
complemented by the sweetness of the rowanberry sauce. The sauce was
essentially a demi-glace made from jelly, stock, and a little sugar for
sweetness.
The vegetables consisted of potato, sweetcorn, and broccoli, not an
inspiring selection, but well cooked.
On such a warm day, a cold dessert would have been more welcome. Maybe
some Scottish berries and cream? The clootie dumpling and custard were
very hot. The small individual dumpling was a reasonably good size. It
was moist and fruity, but lacked the spiciness that I like in a
''clootie''. The custard was unpleasant. Too watery, too sweet, and too
reminiscent of school-dinner custard. I could have done without it.
If your tastes run to the less sweet, a selection of Scottish cheeses
-- which includes Orkney Cheddar and St Andrew's -- is served with
crackers.
The size of the portions was good and the service was informed and
cheery. The food was not served plated, a silver-service style is
adopted. I am not a huge fan of silver service, having been the
recipient of gravy cascading over my shoulder as the waiter balanced a
huge platter with one hand while attempting to serve with the other. But
on the train, the food was served from the end of the table, and I was
impressed by the waiters' expertise in not spilling a drop. However, I
later learned that they lean so heavily against the tables that bruised
legs become an occupational hazard.
The highlight of the meal was the main course, the low point was the
custard. I was pleasantly surprised overall, as I did not expect the
standard to be so high. Eating while moving is rarely a gourmet treat --
one only has to think of airline food. The biggest advantage the train
has over the aeroplane, however, is its kitchen equipped to freshly cook
the food.
A browse around the train galley is testament to the notion of
''everything in its place and a place for everything''. There is no
waste of space. The chef works with a necessary selection of cooking
equipment, such as a hob, eye-level grill, convection oven, and tiny
work-top area for food preparation. But there is no space for
dishwashing facilities -- the dirty dishes are off-loaded at the train's
destination.
Although I was on board with the specific purpose of trying the Taste
of Scotland menu, there is a choice of several menus in the restaurant
car. The Express Diner offers a selection of lighter meals, such as
scampi and chips or nachos with salsa and guacamole. The First Class
menu includes the more exotic grilled rib steak with sauce au poivre or
mesquite salmon fillet. These are not cheap, but certainly no more
expensive than in any mid-spend restaurant.
There is also a good selection of wines. Chosen by wine writer Oz
Clarke, the house wines are Australian. The red is Hardy's Nottage Hill
1992/1993 Cabernet Sauvignon. The white is Hardy's Nottage Hill
1993/1994 Chardonnay. Both are competitively priced at #9.35 for a
bottle. In addition to the house wines the selection also includes a
choice of French and Californian wines.
* The Taste of Scotland menu is served on West Coast InterCity trains
between Glasgow Central and London Euston. From Glasgow it is available
on the 11.40am and 5pm services. From London Euston it is served on the
12.40pm and 5.25pm. Choosing three courses from the Taste of Scotland
menu will cost #17.70, not including wine.

Alan Hollinghurst, a novelist who happens to be a gay man, but is not
a gay novelist, dared to set his second story of homosexual
relationships in Belgium, a country avoided by English literature.
William Russell meets this very modern writer who works with pen and ink
in ledger-like notebooks
LOUCHE, melancholy, both sexually and intellectually potent, The
Folding Star has its own distinctive atmosphere compounded of a grand
nineteenth-century fin de siecle lusciousness, a seamy twentieth-century
fin de siecle carnality and a generous pinch of a true wit. Not my
words, but those of Lucy Hughes-Hallet in the Sunday Times writing about
Alan Hollinghurst's second novel when it appeared in hardback last year.
I could not have put it better, so why try? Short-listed for the 1994
Booker Prize, it is now out in paperback and Hollinghurst has taken to
the publicity trail all over again to promote it.
What sort of man writes novels like this -- let alone his first, The
Swimming Pool Library, which led in 1993 to his being selected as one of
The Best Young British Novelists? Both novels are about gay men. Both
deal frankly with the sex lives of the protagonists, but they are not
gay novels, nor is Hollinghurst a gay novelist. He is a novelist who
happens to be a gay man, which is something quite different, not a fine
distinction. He is not writing for a closet readership. ''There is a gay
genre, books written for gay men, of which I am not a part,'' he said
firmly. Born in Stroud, son of a bank manager, now a Hampstead resident,
he is 40, of medium height, has the sort of iron-grey hair which must
once have been black, a trim beard, spectacles, and a voice so soft that
at times he is hard to hear.
We met in the lounge of the Great Western Hotel at Paddington because
he was on his way to Bath to promote the book at a signing session where
he would read passages from it and chat to his audience. The hotel,
built in Victorian times, a monument to 1950s renovation, all cream
paint, fake chocolate veneers and misjudged proportions, is the ideal
architectural wasteland setting to talk about a book which takes place
in a wasteland.
The hero, Edward Manners, 33 years old and disaffected, a writer, has
fled to a Flemish city, never named, but patently based on Bruges with
distortions, searching for a new life. He is in a world he only half
understands, the perfect setting for obsessions to form, and they do.
Employed to teach English to 17-year-old Luc, he falls insanely in love
with the boy, while at the same time getting involved in trying to
resolve the mysterious life of a celebrated, long-dead local painter,
Edgard Orst.
Hollinghurst pointed out that apart from Villette his is probably the
only British novel set in Belgium. When he told friends that was where
he intended to set it they had greeted the information with incredulity,
he said. Belgium was a country British people tended to know very little
about, a place they drove through or flew over as quickly as possible,
he added. Not that he knows Belgium all that well. He has been there
perhaps half a dozen times for a weekend -- he is particularly admiring
of Antwerp -- and he does not claim to give a picture of contemporary
Belgian life.
''The city Edward goes to, which I never name, is clearly a city of
the imagination,'' he said. ''Obviously it is based on Bruges, but I
have given it features Bruges does not have.'' These include a pulsating
gay night-life which, he admitted, any reader going there expecting to
find would end up disappointed. But the novel was launched in Belgium,
an event he had approached with trepidation, only to be praised, to his
embarrassment, for his perceptive view of the Flemish bourgoisie. The
writer's eye is clearly more perceptive than he would admit.
How does he do it? ''I write everything in pen and ink on a long
ledger-shaped notebook,'' he said. ''That way I get a lot of words on
the page. I write terribly slowly. It sounds a vainglorious thing to
say, but I try to get it right the first time. Then someone puts it in
disc for me and I do further revisions on screen. I can write letters on
the screen, but I cannot compose properly. I need to be able to see
more, for my eye to move back and forward more than is possible on a
screen. There is something about ink and paper that is important to me.
I know some writers easily forgo that and use screens but it still
matters for me.''
He started as a poet, although he no longer writes poetry, but the
shape of sentences, the balance of paragraphs, still matter deeply, and
he is on the brink of starting his third novel. When he approached the
end of one book the ideas for the next one started to form, but it took
a long time, he said. He did not like to start a novel until he had a
pretty good idea of the shape of the thing. It might change a lot, but
he liked to have a firm plan before he began.
''It takes me a while to see how different things connect together,''
he added. ''I tend to start with the peripheral things like images or
atmosphere, but certainly never the story. That tends to grow out of
these other things. There are writers who start with the story and fill
the rest in, but I work the other way round.''
He has worked for the Times Literary Supplement since 1982, after
leaving Oxford, with, it seems, some difficulty, and was for six years
literary editor. You could say, since he is a devoted resident of
Hampstead, a classic example of the legendary Hampstead intellectual.
Since 1990 he has worked for the TLS two days a week and is now its
poetry editor, looks after books about music and architecture --
buildings are a passion, which meant that his recent visit to Glasgow to
promote the paperback afforded him much pleasure.
''The TLS work is interesting in itself and it is nice to have some
kind of intellectual thing to do part of the time rather than spending
the whole day pretending to write and long periods not doing very
much,'' he said. He is, however, quite disciplined, although he does
have long fallow periods. But then he will switch off the telephone,
work for eight hours a day, and ensure there is no possibility of being
interrupted.
He said The Swimming Pool Library was the first novel he had written
which he kept entirely to himself, having learned from experience that
it was a mistake to read things out to people because it was easy to get
bruised from too early exposure. There was also something primitive,
something to do with storytelling, involved. If one had told someone the
story then it spoiled the writing process. That meant he was not going
to tell me about his next book, I asked. It did indeed. He had a lot of
stuff still to work out for himself and it was a private thing, he said.
But the atmosphere would be very different from that of The Folding
Star, more spring like, shorter, lighter.
It was deliberate. He wanted each book to be different, to contrast
with the one before.

EXPLORING THE WORLD OF THE BIBLE LANDS
Roberta L Harris
Thames and Hudson, #16.95
CENTURY ago the great Scots Holy Land scholar George Adam Smith wrote
that the Victorians had ''run to earth'' most of the historical
uncertainties about Palestine. ''It only remains for us to dig them
up.''
Digging has gone on ever since. Archaeology has not displaced
Scripture as the primary source in understanding Holy Land history
(despite new insights and information) but it has dramatically changed
presentation, sometimes in alliance with aerial photography.
After decades of revolutionary change, often affecting the
surface-level landscape as much as the political one, the best
perspectives on the past can come from digging down -- and flying high.
The strength of Roberta Harris's book lies in use of archaeology, and
views from the air are the most striking of superb illustrations. Mrs
Harris is secretary of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society, a
lecturer, and an enthusiast. She is enough of an inter-faith diplomat to
be helpful to Christians as well as Jews and to reflect what she calls
the ''growth of Israeli empathy'' for Palestinian aspirations.
The idea of the Land which has always belonged to ''the two
descendants of Abraham'' echoes Smith's emphasis on Palestine as ''a
land of tribes'', but is a long way from extremism which claims to speak
for Zionism.
The book, to judge from sources and approach, has a mainly Jewish
provenance. The same can be said for Christianity. The Old Testament
emphasis on Solomon and Babylonian exile as well as Abraham and David
would seem far less strange in a Victorian church than a contemporary
one. Some themes of the book (such as Jewish survival in the Land after
New Testament times) are unfamiliar to Christians but deserve to be
widely known.
But in places the author's wording could be more felicitous, facts
might be checked, or opinions revised. The ''Christian Bible'' is not
divided into five parts, starting with the Gospels, but (as all
Christian traditions believe) presents the Word of God as contained in
Old and New Testaments. The King James translation was not the first in
English with ''official sanction''.
And the ideas that Paul began preaching the news of Christ to Gentiles
and created ''the classic form of Christianity'' need more qualification
than they get here. John's Gospel, surely ''classic'' enough, is only
mentioned in passing.
The discussion of synagogues also needs revision. It is the Acts and
Epistles, not the Gospels, which testify to the growth of Jewish
communities outside Palestine. What the Gospels suggest is that even in
Palestine before the destruction of the Temple there were synagogues
which were ''public buildings'' and places of assembly.

THE UNCONSOLED
Kazuo Ishiguro
Faber &amp; Faber, #15.99
ISHIGURO'S career has been an object lesson in success. Following a
creative-writing course at the University of East Anglia, his first
novel, written in his late twenties, was selected for the first Best of
Young British batch, his second was short-listed for the Booker Prize,
and his third won it in 1989.
This is his first book since The Remains of the Day. It is his
difficult book, the one critics will argue over, the book he wrote for
himself, which had a problematic birth and was hard to understand, the
one he had to finish, where he wanted to change direction to be freed
from his previous work. One can almost hear his publishers' groan on
every page.
The opening is obscure and gives a taste of what's to come. A taxi
driver abandons Ryder -- who is regarded by many as ''the world's finest
living pianist'' -- in the empty lobby of a hotel in a nameless Central
European city, embarrassed by the inhospitable reception.
Gustav escorts him to the lift. On the way to his room, Ryder is
treated to a five-page monologue on the problems of portering. With
Ryder in his room the first inkling of this book's vagaries, false
trails, and obscurities is confirmed. On no evidence Ryder concludes
Gustav is worried about his estranged daughter Sophie and her son,
Boris.
In another part of the building, Hoffman, the hotel manager, is
anxious to show his wife's collection of press cuttings devoted to
Ryder's career. Ryder is to perform that evening, sharing the bill with
the Hoffmans' son, who solicits some professional advice.
Apart from the taxi driver, everyone seems connected to Ryder, to know
more about him and his past than we do, or than he does himself. The
simplest request carries a warning, underlining the already obvious
associations with Kafka. But Dostoevsky is in there too, especially in
the relentless sweep of events which seem out of control and the
nightmarish quality of reality.
The anterior feeling is confirmed when Gustav asks if Ryder would talk
with Sophie which forces Ryder to dimly recall a conversation about
moving house. It now seems Ryder and Sophie have had a relationship
though he is not Boris's father.
This is the novel's most difficult aspect, the sense that Ryder is
participating in the events he unravels, that he is commentating on
himself for his own benefit, with neither a sense of discovery, nor the
benefit of revelation. We are therefore in the midst of events we do not
understand.
Things keep happening. Time expands and contracts, situations
converge, people appear and disappear. A passage can lead to a field or
a forest, a cupboard to a concert-hall or hotel bedroom. We learn to
distrust Ryder's anticipation, knowing he will be waylaid.
He believes he is being taken for lunch, but ends up in a transport
cafe where Doris is waiting. With a variety of conflicting promises to
keep, Ryder makes a further promise to the tram conductress, whom he
recognises as a friend from Worcestershire, furious because he did not
attend her party the night before. When he eventually meets Sophie,
Ryder begins to recall another life, an apartment and shared memories.
And so it goes winding on, very little is clear, but certain facts
seem to emerge. Ryder had a miserable childhood, filled with ''training
sessions''. He is still scared of his parents, recalling the thrill that
accompanied the mounting fear and panic of being late home.
Everything is tightly controlled: the story and its dialogue, the
meetings and haphazard conjunctions are part of something we do not
understand, as someone in Ryder's position, someone smarting from the
damage of prolonged emotional control, lacks understanding and is
capable only of living in the fear.
The disastrous concert-hall ending deepens rather than resolves the
mystery, leaving Ryder's search for identity and the reader's quest for
understanding, meaning, or sympathy beyond reach.

LEGENDS OF THE FALL
Jim Harrison
Flamingo, #5.99
IN Legends of the Fall, Brad Pitt as Tristan Ludlow emotes. Lips
tremble, eyes moon, his long blond hair is tossed around like the tail
of the horse he rides away on, leaving heartbreak behind.
Yet it is the words unspoken that mark the difference between movies
and novels, or the novella which Jim Harrison's 74-page masterpiece
surely is.
In one sentence the authorial voice of Harrison, the hard man of
American letters, defines Tristan's character. ''So perhaps Tristan in a
genetic lapse had become his own father and would like Cain never take
an order from anyone but would build his own fate with gestures so
personal that no-one in the family ever knew what was on his seemingly
thankless mind.''
Harrison is a literary hero; cinema audiences enthralled by the story
of the three sons of Colonel William Ludlow and the one women they love
deserve an opportunity to discover for themselves why Jack Nicholson
loaned the author the sum of $20,000 to feed his family while he wrote
the story. The men met on the set of The Missouri Breaks and remain firm
friends.
The film Wolf in which Nicholson starred as a lycanthrope was written
by Harrison and based on a vivid personal experience. Alone, drunk and
drugged in a cabin in the hills of Northern Michigan, Harrison
hallucinated that he had been bitten by a wolf and began charging naked
round the darkened countryside. As an environmentalist he would not earn
a conventional Greenpeace badge, but remains charged with a private
passion.
Harrison was born the son of a country agricultural agent who taught
him fly-fishing, bird shooting, and a love of the land. His grandfather
perfected the art of the bar-room brawl, slopping out pub patrons while
on crutches for calling him a cripple.
Hemingway's name-tag has been stitched into his eight poetry books,
six novels, and three novella collections, the latest of which, Julip
(HarperCollins, #14.99), was published recently -- to a stony silence
from the English literary press.
Yet Harrison is not Hemingway. His brand of outdoor ruggedness is not
diluted by sentimentality, and though his sentences are straightforward
and simple the images they can construct are stunning. Emotion runs
through his work but not the typical teary geyser, instead he taps into
a person's core.
The sweep of his novella Legends of the Fall is complex but confident.
In the middle he tells us the end, yet still we read on frantic with
anticipation as he trawls us across continents and countryside where the
wildlife is truly tangible but which still bites.
Though the film is fine, it is a picture which we can never touch.
Through the precise words of Jim Harrison not only can the reader
touch it but we feel every body-blow. Tristan becomes our brother and we
miss him. Forget the movie; read the book. Discover why Jim Harrison is
an author with immortality in him.

GARBO
Barry Paris
Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, #20
OUT of sight, out of reach, Garbo haunts us still. Or rather we hound
her memory, forever picking over the bones of a legend which always was
more of our making than hers.
And yet there was substance to her goddess status. In the span of 20
years she commanded worship like no other star, conquering the silent
screen by the magnetism of her beauty, then triumphing in talkies where
that deep, creamy voice wrapped in Swedish intonation and so often
propelled by some mysterious sorrow, added one more cryptic quality to
Greta Garbo's boundless appeal.
Mute, in films from 1921 to 1930, she was already a romantic star but
that first audible line in Anna Christie, a startling demand for whisky,
gave her increased box-office power. By growling, keening, teasing,
weeping, or exchanging fated love in a whisper, Garbo could animate the
most banal of scripts. She was not a great actress; she was not a great
brain. But she was intuitive, which gave her acting a sincerity and she
possessed a certain northern European no-nonsense quickness of mind
which set her apart from the image-darlings on the lot.
But what else was there that so many parasitic voyeurs should be able
to live off her name? Garbo literature is endless and largely
speculative because she was one of the few stars who didn't play-act her
insistence on privacy. She needed it like a heartbeat because it was the
only way to snatch back the person drowning in the legend. If she could
not control what others believed her to be then she could, at least,
vacate the celebrity shell.
From 1941 to her death in 1990, she shut herself away from a public
role. Even so it did not stop the prying.
People do not relinquish their heroes easily, which left Garbo with
only one way to beat them: she grew old. ''Some quirk of nature and art
created a face, a personality and an erotic presence unprecedented in
history,'' writes Barry Paris, author of perhaps the most fastidiously
objective Garbo biography which attempts the impossible: the
illumination of the twentieth century's sphinx.
''Garbo's ego boundaries, and personal identity were never very
strong,'' he notes. ''She was a textbook case of dazzling exterior far
removed from inner self. The seductiveness was acting; she didn't really
feel seductive.''
Paris, who writes for the New Yorker and Vanity Fair, has pieced
together his mosaic from private papers and countless taped
conversations Garbo had with a small circle of trusted friends. He
arrived at his subject well versed in the quirks of Hollywood, having
written the difinitive biography of that great screen iconoclast, Louise
Brooks.
And, like many before him, he devotes a mass of dense research to the
ambiguities in Garbo's sexual nature.
The perfect desirable illusion she created, he maintains, was simply
that. It was ''not transferable'' to life. ''On the contrary it only
aggravated her fear of personal intimacy. She was neither self-deluded
nor self-reflective but she was baffled and frightened by the reaction
of the outside world. She was receiving some 15,000 fan letters a week,
many of which were pornographic and none of which she read. Garbo was
not a highly sexual person and the constant sexual fantasies projected
on her -- full of subjugation and trans-sexuality -- gave her a hold
over people she never sought.''
Paris quotes her as follows: Who are all these people who write? I
don't know them. They don't know me. What do we have to write each other
about? Why do they want my picture? I'm not their relative.
There was no arrogance intended here but that reaction suggests a
rather gruff and maybe unimaginative amusement. Paris's book may be
over-laden with repetitive detail but it differs from many in its
illustration of not so much a complex character as a stern,
literal-minded one. Towards the close of the twenties much was made of
Garbo's alleged love affair with the pretty matinee actor of the day,
John Gilbert.
Gilbert was sexy, fun and full of worship for Garbo, but Paris records
that he was also ''immature, self-pitying, indiscreet, manic depressive,
and prone to fights and drunken scenes''.
Not the ideal suitor, then, for someone who had already confided to
her closest friends that she could not stand people who got drunk. So,
was the romance and the public's expectancy of marriage simply a studio
ruse to dampen down any suspicion that the real Garbo preferred to bed
women rather than men?
After almost 70 years who is left to tell the truth? Before she died,
Louise Brooks decided to have her rebellious say: ''Almost all men
disliked Gilbert. He was a kind of disgrace to their sex -- feminine,
not homo, but wildly emotional. There is enough dyke in me to know that
Garbo must have detested him . . . She did what every actress has done
since the word whore has been changed to the word actress. She went out
with him and gave him a casual lay from time to time for the sake of her
career.''
As for Garbo herself, a timidity combined with her innate need for
isolation made her loathe the very notion of marriage to anyone: ''
'love?' she mused. 'It is the beginning of a woman's education. Who has
not been in love? But marriage? There is always my overwhelming desire
to be alone.' ''
Superficially this might seem the cri de coeur of a thoroughly modern
woman but within Garbo there was also a chronic state of indecision. Her
standard reply to an invitation was a semi-humorous but graceless: ''How
do I know I'll be hungry on Wednesday?'' She had, says Paris, a
pathological fear of obligating herself for a dinner date, let alone a
relationship.
Greta Garbo was never sexy in the Dietrich style. Her withdrawn
melancholy lacked animal sizzle, and very probably men were in awe more
than in love with her. When she appeared as Queen Christina, Anna
Karenina, Mata Hari, or Camille, how many husbands dreamed of a weekend
in Brighton with Garbo? And neither was she a delicate wraith, but from
Swedish farming stock. ''Those shoulders,'' wrote one critic of the
time, ''might have swum the Channel.''
Yet who among her public cared? In its time Garbo's austere poise gave
new emphasis to the female image. Off-screen, as if in open contempt for
her beauty she clumped about in stout, flat shoes and something
resembling a Hitler raincoat. Her mannish hats were stubbornly tilted to
hide most of her face; her hair was severe and straight.
Even so, none of this demolished the fact that she remained one of the
most beautiful women who has ever lived. But by 1941, the year of her
last movie, Two-faced Woman, films and public taste were changing and
Garbo, incurably romantic as an actress, was nevertheless enough of a
realist to detect the nuance in the air. In her 45th year, bored by her
own screen material and by now really wishing to be private if not
entirely alone, she cannily removed herself from Hollywood before
Hollywood picked its moment to forget.
For most of her remaining life she lived in New York in her old,
handsome apartment on East 52nd Street, guarded by protective doormen
and respectful neighbours. Her taste in furnishings and paintings was
subtle, European, and also based on wise investments although a
reclusive nature required few luxuries. Her secrecy, of course, was
unwittingly her greatest gift to the publicity machine, exaggerating
that very solitary quality and ensuring that any showing of her work
creates a stir. Greta Garbo shed the Garbo myth, preferring the true
mundanity behind it. But we, in our hunger for idols, exalt it still.
Out of sight, out of reach, she is changeless.

SO I AM GLAD A L Kennedy Cape, #9.99
THE distinction between the popular and the literary novel is a
controversial one. The popular novel in its various forms -- historical
fiction, Aga saga, bodice ripper -- is taken to be for entertainment and
titillation, to be abandoned on train and plane. But the literary novel
is challenging, often obscure, and needs to be revisited. Occasionally,
the two types of fiction coalesce, as in John Fowles's The French
Lieutenant's Woman (1969), a large critical and commercial success.
It is not the fiction writers who have insisted on these definitions,
but critics and academics whose fear is that originality and
individuality are being suppressed through the demands of the mass
audience for easy reading and who wish to demonstrate their own
intellectual abilities through reviews and critical studies.
Alison Kennedy writes literary fiction praised for the cleverness of
its ideas and the subtlety and fluidity of its language. A Scottish
reviewer of Now That You're Back, Kennedy's collection of short stories,
quoted in Cape's promotion material, warned: ''The metaphysical
complexities underlying Kennedy's themes are simply beyond the grasp of
her contemporaries.''
Kennedy's new novel, So I Am Glad, is narrated by Jennifer M Wilson (M
for Mercy). She has had the kind of background that makes a social
worker despair. She suffered childhood abuse, apparently by having to
witness her parents having sex and later on, became involved in
sado-masochistic activities with Steven. In the course of this novel
Jennifer learns that Martin her flatmate is in fact Cyrano de Bergerac.
He takes her to Paris to travel through his previous life.
This is a novel about fantasy. There is the sexual fantasy of
Jennifer's parents; the fantasy she shares with Steven in their sexual
violence; the fantasy involved in her job as an announcer and voice-over
artiste, promoting products that promise to make life easier and more
interesting. Then there is Martin's reincarnation fantasy.
With these themes So I am Glad is very much a novel of the late 1990s.
Her narrator's function as an announcer gives Kennedy a plausible device
for commentating on the state of society. For example: ''Sometimes I
feel as if my generation was galloped one morning over a huge,
metaphorical employment cliff and some of us were saved immediately,
scooped up by angels or helicopters or convenient safety nets and given
a useful or meaningful life.''
I quote this for another reason. Kennedy has been praised for the
refreshing way in which she uses language, but I found many parts of
this novel contrived and unconvincing, and sometimes absurd. One of the
dangers of the literary novel is that the reader is invited to treat a
slick phrase like a profound philosophical statement out of
Wittgenstein's Tractatus which only the cleverest reader will
comprehend.
There is no more difficult theme in fiction than sexual deviance. How
does Kennedy approach it? By the device of telling the reader, when a
sado-masochistic scene is coming up: ''Want to see it? Close your eyes
now if you don't.'' This of course has the effect of making the reader
anticipate the blood-letting and sexual postures. But it can be read as
a disingenuous device for avoiding the subject, which Kennedy proceeds
to describe mechanically because, it can be argued, sado-masochism is
essentially a mechanical process where the sensations are physical.
Again, in Kennedy's creation of Martin, the reader will wonder if the
writer is indulging in some sleight-of-hand. Martin the intellectual
believes that he was Cyrano de Bergerac, the French satirist and
dramatist whose works combine satire and science-fantasy. The trick is
that if you create an artificial character with science-fantasy
properties (Martin glows in the dark) you cannot be criticised for being
artificial.
A L Kennedy is the Tom Stoppard of the page. She is capable of writing
apparently profound dialogue, and does extremely clever things with
narrative technique and time. At the end, though, is this not a
demonstration of cleverness for its own sake, a carefully contrived
creative process in which spontaneity, sincerity, and even naivety --
the so-called failings of popular fiction -- are excluded?
Kennedy's acknowledgments at the end of this novel, thanking various
French libraries for help in researching the life and work of Cyrano de
Bergerac, and citing a French study for further reading, may be taken as
a display of intimidating erudition as well as raising the question:
where should research end and the creative process begin? The question
may be put in another way: where does cleverness end and creativity
begin?
So I Am Glad epitomises the paradox of many modern literary works of
fiction. The writer wants to communicate with as many people as possible
about social and political themes, and claims to be the voice of the
disadvantaged and inarticulate person in the street (like Kelman's blind
Sammy) but the novel ends up being regarded an elitist product promoted
by those who prize cleverness for its own sake.

In the first of a series of occasional columns, Willie Anderson looks
at trends in the books world from a bookseller's point of view
MODERN technology is affecting the book trade to an alarming extent.
The products on the market appear to pose the question of what now
constitutes a book. This may seem an absurd query, but it is becoming
more and more relevant.
A book, as tradition has it, is an object made up of several sheets of
paper, bound together, either between hard cloth-covered boards, or
between two rather glossy paper wrappers. Usually, the sheets have words
printed upon them and, if you are very lucky, the occasional picture.
These traditional books have been with us for a few centuries now and
have been providers of entertainment, information, and education. They
are mostly read at night as an effective aid to a deep and trouble-free
sleep. Many households will have a dictionary or encyclopaedia on their
bookshelves, or in a cupboard. These tomes are useful for sometimes
providing the answer to a Wee Stinker clue.
All that tradition is changing. These works of reference may now be
found on CD-ROMS similar in appearance to your Neil Young or Bob Dylan
CD, and which may be installed in your homely PC. Acronyms are part and
parcel of the computer lingo, mainly because they sound more credible
than the words they represent.
Nevertheless, the delights of manipulating your mouse around the pages
of the Oxford English Dictionary are, I have to admit, endlessly
fascinating and mind-bogglingly simple. For younger children than me, a
heaven-sent homework aid has been created, as articles, pictures, and
charts are available to all to be printed off for inclusion in the
beautifully typed and spell-checked essay. (The spell-checker provides
hours of fun in its suggestions for the spelling of words and names it
does not recognise.) Teachers too benefit as they no longer have to
decipher the myriad handwriting codes.
There is an undoubted fascination in learning from the screen. Most of
us watch television; viewing a computer screen has a similar feel,
though one can be far more selective in the programs. Computerised works
of reference have dramatically opened up the desire of youngsters of all
ages for knowledge. The disk has, as a consequence, seriously damaged
the future viability of the traditional reference book, which in this
context has become, in comparison, cumbersome and outdated. Fortunately
for booksellers and publishers, not everyone has a computer as yet.
One of the first entrants into what we now term the multimedia book
were the language tapes, which attempted to teach the listener the
necessary phrases required to buy a coke in Marbella. Language tapes are
still hugely popular, but it is the growth in demand for books on tape
for children and novels which has shown the biggest increase over the
last few years.
The Sony Walkman combined with a children's tape has saved many a
long-distance car journey, as the little darlings can listen to a story
instead of constantly inquiring from Hamilton onwards if they were yet
near Nice.
The major contribution of books on tape is that it has once again
brought books into the lives of those who are blind or who have poor
eyesight. The selection of novels available is fairly extensive, ranging
from the classics of the Brontes, Shakespeare, or Zola to the modern
works of le Carre, P D James, or Joanna Trollope.
One may walk with Stevenson's donkey while digging the potato patch,
or marvel, while jogging along the highway, at how little politics has
changed since the days of Samuel Pepys.
I have referred to the tapes and the disks as a form of book, mainly
because most of them have derived from an original printed work. What is
now on the horizon is literature and learning on the internet, or the
electronic super highway for short. Will authors need publishers, and if
there are no publishers where do all the booksellers go? Who will have
copyright to the printed word? Anyone will be able to adapt text to
their own needs without recourse to permission from the originator, if
there ever was one.
Despite this doomsday scenario, the traditional book is not yet dead.
It is difficult to take a computer to bed, or to read a screen under the
bed-covers by torchlight.
The immediate irony is that those who buy and use their computer
invariably have to purchase a book, made of paper, to learn how to work
their machine. The computer may conjure up fantastic images on screen,
but are they anywhere near as fantastic as those created in the reader's
mind by the descriptive powers of the author in print?
Finally, please read David Guterson's first novel Snow Falling On
Cedars. It is published later this month and is quite brilliant.

The fortunes of its football team may vary but nothing can beat an
original Forfar bridie. Apart, that is, from a scurrilous rumour as to
its origins. William Hunter finds that the very thought of bridies being
born elsewhere is hard to swallow
SAY Forfar quickly. Instant links are lush. They have to do with best
beef cattle, good grain, special potatoes. It is a well-off and county
town. Genteelly it bottles mineral water. Guide dogs for blind people
take their training in its main streets.
Forfar is famous also for its football, this season it is at any rate,
the Athletic being top dogs of their pack. Cricket, though, seems more
the style. There is a stateliness about Forfar. It has grand notions
about itself. Not content with one High Street, it has two. And history
has touched its lieges with royal connections.
There are Forfarians (as they like to call themselves) pleased to
claim that their burgh was once the capital of Scotland, although it is
a boast treated lightly by other people, including most Forfarians.
Their closest association is homelier. Say Forfar and what the rest of
the world thinks is bridies.
Local pies have an enshrined place even in the renewed local museum.
But unmentioned in its first exhibition -- at least not yet, nor with
scholarly certainty -- is the shy-making possibility that Forfar bridies
may be a piece of piracy.
It could be some crust on Forfar's part to claim them. For, maybe, the
birthplace of bridies was elsewhere. Awkward facts may oblige Norman
Atkinson, museum curator of Angus district, one day, and intrepidly, to
assert that bridies were the gift to a grateful world not from the town
but by nearby Glamis village.
At the restored Meffan Institute, reopened in March as a museum and
art gallery, and centrally situated on one of the two High Streets, he
conceded it was a little daring to put bridies in a museum at all.
He said: ''I think people's concepts of what should be in museums is
changing. I remember when I was a very young curator being told we could
only collect certain things. But food and drink are essential items.
Here we also have old confectionery. They are just as much a part of the
story of human existence in and around Forfar as anything. And that goes
for language and customs.
''There is no reason in the world why we can't collect and interpret
things for future generations that we don't normally keep in museums.''
He agreed that bridies can't be kept. ''But you can certainly model
them (in fibreglass) and you can collect recipes and all sorts of
information about them,'' he said.
At the Meffan Institute, a douce townhouse of a people's palace given
to the town last century by the prosperous and political Meffan family,
The Forfar Story exhibition takes a long run to get to bridies. Its
narrative goes back to neolithic times.
Angus remains especially rich in Pictish carvings and Celtic stones
now catalogued and described on the latest whizzo museum electronic
display screens.
Norman Atkinson said: ''Imparting information is something which has
to change. People used to pick up books; they used to read museum
labels. Not all people do now, especially young people. I don't think we
should be afraid of using the new ways of imparting knowledge.''
Another old (1090 or so) Meffan treasure is a logboat, scooped from
one oak tree and unearthed by workmen when digging a trench in 1952.
Even more recently a stone coffin was struck during the extension of a
cemetery.
Forfar was a kingly country retreat of Malcolm Canmore (1058-96) and
his queen, the pious Margaret. Succeeding monarchs favoured the place
for a rural playground. They selected Forfar for its fresh air and good
eating.
But there are long blank passages in the old burgh's story which the
museum show does not attempt to fill. Royal remains on the ground -- a
castle and such -- were razed. Even a paper trail into Forfar's past is
hard to find because Cromwell ordered a burning of the town for its
support for Charles I. Municipal chronicles went up in the
conflagration.
Between pre-history and living memory there is not much sandwich
filling to the town's story, making its contents the opposite of a
bridie's.
How Forfar had a Sunday-best style is suggested by two exhibits. One
is the 1817 public notice about the duties of the constabulary. On
ordinary weekdays the streets seem not to have needed policing. Weekends
were when all the fun happened. Apart from market days, never on Sundays
were the highways left unpatrolled.
It was the chief duty of constables in the main quarters of the town
to keep the streets clear of Sabbath-breakers and to leave uncluttered
the promenades of the Godly to church.
And in earlier days, it was between Sunday services that the trials of
witches were righteously heard. A tumultuous museum tableau dramatises
Forfar's enthusiasm for hunting wayward women, usually for no more
terrible reason than that they were drabs and drunks.
According to a label, 42 were accused of Satanic misdeeds in 1661-3.
First, they were deprived of sleep in the tolbooth and kept in the dark
in unheated cells. After hanging, their bodies were burned in tar
barrels. Forfar's assiduity was unmatched throughout the shire.
''There is no earthly reason why it should stand out,'' Norman
Atkinson suggested. ''But it was the county town and may have felt it
had to take the lead.''
Taking the story towards modern times, the Meffan goes on to the
streets with a narrow, cobbled vennel of four atmospheric shops. There
is a cobbler's bothy, aromatic with the smell of leather, that
represents how shoemaking was the main trade until around 1700. Linen
and jute works replaced it. So there is a weaver's shed.
For the most evocative stall has been recreated the sweetshop of Peter
Reid in Castle Street, once called the Spoot in the individual accent of
Forfarians because it had a public well. Together with the soor plooms
and other goodies he sold, the memory of Peter Reid is cherished as a
town benefactor. From selling coloured sugar he amassed enough to
bequeath a public park.
How he spread Forfar's name beyond its boundaries was with his sticks
of rock. Peter Reid rock seems to have been famous, like Blackpool's. No
traveller to the town thought of leaving without buying some to take
home, or so Norman Atkinson has been told by museum visitors.
''I've been told more about Peter Reid since we opened the museum than
we knew when setting up his shop,'' he admitted. So far, however, he has
been unable to find out any sticky details about the famed rock.
''People keep the strangest things,'' he explained, ''but nobody has
kept rock.''
Unlike the cobbler's booth, the Meffan's bakehouse has not been given
a warm pastry smell of its own. It was feared an oven fragrance would
seep into every corner of the museum. Besides, it might have become
confused with the real-life aroma from the bridie baker's shop across
the High Street.
Because these are still early days, The Forfar Story has only nibbled
at its bridie chapter. Certain to be complex, it threatens also to be
controversial.
In the town are two dynastic baking families and each keeps its secret
recipe, especially as to what spices are used. Historically, their pies
have separate pedigrees. One batch were labelled real and the other
described as baked to the original recipe.
Just to buy a pie is not simple. Having asked for a bridie, please, an
unknowing customer is given a patient interrogation. Does he want a
small, medium, or large (or Saturday) bridie? Moreover, ''small'' in
Forfar amounts anywhere else to rather big, while the large (or
Saturday) size looks less of a horseshoe shape than the footprint of a
pre-historic monster.
Also, there are different kinds of pie (or so an innocent stranger was
told at the Meffan). Bridies with one hole in their short pastry have
mince in them. Two-holers have onions as well. Three holes indicate
steak mince inside, or else cubes of best Aberdeen-Angus.
Norman Atkinson has dated the creation of bridies to the 1820s. It
makes them one of the earliest convenience foods. They were an edible
pack, compact, efficient, and with flat corners, like handles, to hold
on to. Angus seems an unlikely place for their invention. It is a part
of the world with a leisurely gait that takes its time to eat and do
eveything else.
But the richness of bridies makes sense. Forfarians are not the kind
of folk to settle for that skimpy, grey cousin of bridies found in
industrial cities, the Scotch pie. So, yes, it is possible to see
bridies as an acceptable snack to carry to the field for farmworkers to
fill a hole with at midday. But why bridie?
Conventional scholarship suggests it might be from the bride's piece
-- a quick buffet provided by a bride's parents to speed their guests on
the long miles to home over the hills. Well, maybe. Norman Atkinson said
he was not convinced.
It is at least a little strange, even remiss, that Forfar knows more
about the origins of an eleventh-century logboat hollowed out of an oak
tree than about the history of the handy feast that has become
universally attached to its name.
Without yet having got his teeth into the subject, Norman Atkinson
offered an alternative explanation. Such research as there has been time
for has come across a Margaret Bridie who baked pies at Glamis at the
start of last century. A headstone in the village graveyard attests to
her life and times.
With the coming of the railways, Mrs Bridie's treats enjoyed a
widening market. Passengers might still have been eating their bridies
when the trains arrived in Forfar. Alert town bakers (this is only a
theory, mind) made copies.  Although both baking families have shops on
the High Steet that is two streets, their early bakehouses were where
the railway station used to be. The livestock mart was also at that end
of town. Forfar (really Glamis) bridies became staple nosh for farmers
looking for a quick sustaining bite between the helpings of more liquid
nourishment they preferred on market days.
If that is how bridies were born, the Meffan will be offering a
helping of history tough for Forfar to chew on and harder to swallow.
For there is an old saying that, because of their accent, you can always
tell Forfarians -- but you cannot tell them much.

Pretoria,
WORLD Cup referees will meet team managers and coaches in Cape Town
today when representatives from each of the 16 nations competing in the
Rugby World Cup will be given scripture and verse from the tournament
''bible'' on how the competition will be refereed.
With the laws of the game open to individual interpretation, a
standardised approach by officials is crucial if the tournament is not
to become a lottery.
Refereeing of the lineout has raised controversy with Welsh referee
Derek Bevan, apparently stating that he was in disagreement with the
tournament organisers' stand-point on the vexed question of ''lifting''
and support for the touchline jumpers.
Referees have been told to come down on sides who are perceived to be
lifting in the lineout. Throughout the recent Five Nations' tournament
referees turned a blind eye to lineout support play even when it
entailed a touch of lifting.
That will not be the case here. Last night, Scotland's top referee Jim
Fleming said that the tournament organisers were adamanat that the
''bible'' should be strictly adhered to.
Fleming said that he had not seen Bevan's reported comments which
declared that a referee's revolt was being threatened and that, in any
case, he thought such an eventuality unlikely.
Scotland manager Duncan Paterson said: ''Dougie Morgan will be going
to a meeting of coaches, referees, and refereeing assessors and I have
no doubt that the question of how the lineout is to be refereed will be
raised there.''
Meanwhile, the Scotland squad trained twice yesterday at the Pretoria
Harlequins ground, a gruelling contact session taking place in the
morning and a lighter, skills session in the afternoon.
The contact session left a number of players in the walking-wounded
category, but the management were stressing that none of the injuries
was causing concern.
John Manson, the Dundee HS FP prop, took no part in the session as he
has come down with a stomach bug. Similarly afflicted was Stewart
Campbell, who withdrew from the session after 10 minutes. The pair now
will room together in the team hotel in an effort to stop the bug from
spreading.
Captain Gavin Hastings sustained a bang on the ribs during tackle
practice and sat out the rest of the session as did Peter Wright (knee)
and David Hilton (ankle), while Craig Chalmers has a bruised thigh.
Paterson said that the Scottish party was unconcerned by the minor
injuries. ''I think they were predictable,'' he said. ''That was our
first contact session and it is a funny thing that when you are
simulating tackles and so on, you seem to be more vulnerable to injury
but there is nothing to worry about.''

* SRU secretary Bill Hogg, in Pretoria with the Scotland squad, said
that reports suggesting that Watsonians would join Stirling County in a
proposed European league were premature.
The competition, being organised by Carnegie-Quintas, was first mooted
last month. It envisages teams from the home unions, France, Italy, and
Spain taking part in a fully-fledged European championship.
However, invited clubs must first obtain permission from their
respective ruling bodies.
''These latest reports, so far as I am aware, refer to the same
competition that was talked about last month,'' said Hogg. ''There are
ongoing discussions and that is as far as it goes at the moment.''

ABERDEEN and their new manager, Roy Aitken, tomorrow will try to
complete the job that their caretaker manager -- the same Roy Aitken --
started by establishing a lead big enough to ensure that they overcome
Dunfermline over the two legs of their play-off and thus retain their
place in the premier division.
This is the second-last hurdle of a long, painful, and controversial
season but it will have to be tackled with the same energy and
application which enabled the club to rise from the bottom place, which
guaranteed relegation, into the play-off scenario.
Their opponents, Dunfermline, who were pipped by a single point for
promotion last season and have now missed the one guaranteed place by
the same margin, harbour ambitions to restore the great days to East End
Park.
''I know Dunfermline's strengths and am not underestimating them,''
said Aitken, ''but they had better be ready for a game. They will never
have experienced anything like the cauldron Pittodrie will be. The
electric atmosphere will go a long way to deciding the outcome.''
He insisted that in his squad are big-time players who revel in this
kind of atmosphere. ''They will prove that again on Sunday. I have said
repeatedly that when this team is at its best, it takes a very good one
to beat us.''
He is aware of Dunfermline's talents. ''They have good blend of
experience and youth, which will make it difficult, but I am only
concerned with what we do. My players have answered all the criticisms
about their character with their performances in the last six games.
''They have been in this do-or-die situation so many times before that
I am certain they will handle it once again.''
Aberdeen have midfield player Peter Hetherston back from suspension,
but there was not a lot of good news for Dunfermline as they prepared
for the trip north. Their striker, Marc Millar, has been ruled out
because of a persistent stomach-muscle injury, although he may be able
to return for the second leg on Thursday.
''It's a bad blow,'' said manager Bert Paton, who has already lost two
strikers this season, Hamish French and Kenny Ward. Allan Moore will
probably take his place, although Paton could opt for a more defensive
option by bringing in former Birmingham City midfielder Paul Fenwick.
''In these games the theory is to play defensive on the away leg and
hammer the opposition at home,''reckoned Paton, ''but I haven't decided
yet what to do at Pittodrie. We have lost only four games this season --
the least of any British team -- yet we are also one of the highest
goal-scorers.''
The Fife manager is right when he claims that all the pressure is
really on the premier side, and maybe he is also accurate when he adds
that his players will not be short on confidence, having been unbeaten
in their past 15 games.
Regardless of the play-off outcome, Aitken knows there will be no cash
available to restructure his Aberdeen squad. Chairman Ian Donald made it
clear that he would expect Aitken to wheel and deal in the market to
strengthen his personnel.
One deal that seems likely to go ahead and bring some cash to
Pittodrie, even if they would prefer to keep the player, is the transfer
of defender Stephen Wright to Rangers for #1.5m.
The other sides involved in post-season action, of course, are Airdrie
and Celtic, who meet in the final of the Tennents Scottish Cup next
Saturday. Celtic returned from their Italian sojourn last night.
Meanwhile there was no further movement in Rangers' eforts to sign
both Romanian Florin Raducioiu and Paul Gascoigne. There seem to be no
problems with transfer fees for either, #2.5m for Raducioiu and #4.5m
for Gascoigne, and it will now be up to the players to agree terms. In
Gascoigne's case that has to wait until he has reached a compensation
settlement with Lazio, and the Romanian still has a couple of games to
play for his club, Espanyol, before he can sort out his future.

THE English must be wondering how it is that Scots are hijacking the
most dramatic confrontations of their football season.
Last weekend it was Kenny Dalglish versus Alex Ferguson in the battle
for the Premiership title, won by Blackburn's Dalglish.
Today at Wembley the Manchester United manager faces a threat from his
namesake, Duncan, the tall Everton striker who will be unleashed by
manager Joe Royle against the Old Trafford team.
Duncan Ferguson has shaken off the effects of a recent hernia
operation. He has been training, and, indeed, played 45 minutes of a
reserve game earlier this week.
Now, for the final, he seems sure to at least find a place on the
bench until Royle decides to hurl him into action.
Ferguson, despite the off-field problems which have haunted him, is
focused on his football this weekend, in what will be the biggest day of
his career so far.
''I believe that we can beat United,'' he said. ''Remember, we have
done that already in the Premiership. In any case the atmosphere at the
club has been tremendous since Joe Royle took over as manager. There has
been more consistency, the results have been good, and he has brought
out the best in the players.
''I include myself in that. Before the operation I felt as if I was
playing the best football of my life. That is down to the manager. But
even without me the team was able to win in the semi-final against Spurs
when they were underdogs. If we could play that way again in the final
then we would win the cup.''
Ferguson has settled in England, and Merseyside has taken the young
Scot to its heart. ''I feel at home here,'' he said. ''The fans have
made me welcome.
''You would expect that from the Everton support but even the
Liverpool fans have been okay. There has never been any of the hassle I
had to put up with in Scotland. The people on Merseyside are happy to
let you get on with your life.
''It was difficult for me to leave Rangers. After all, that was the
club I had always wanted to play for, but coming to Everton has been the
right move for me. The fact that Joe Royle took over as manager and
showed faith in me has helped me. He has been a tremendous influence.''
Meanwhile, the other Ferguson, Alex, has tried to play down the threat
that the six-foot-three-inch frontman carries. ''I thought that our
defenders handled him really well when we played them in the league,''
said the manager. ''I know he scored but he didn't do much else.
''We have Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister who are strong in the air so
it won't worry us too much if he does play.''
Ferguson has been more concerned about the injury worry over winger
Ryan Giggs. It looks now as if he will gamble on the Welshman who has
been suffering from a hamstring injury.
''We have to consider starting Ryan in the game because he has looked
good in training,'' said Ferguson. ''Whenever you look at a hamstring
injury, there is a gamble involved in playing someone who has just
recovered from that. But we don't expect any setback.''
Ferguson also will play Mark Hughes. Last week he left him out of the
match at West Ham and was criticised for so doing. That mistake, if it
was a mistake, won't be repeated today.
United have had their share of problems, the league was lost, and now
Andrei Kanchelskis has again blasted his manager, claiming he does not
want to play for him again.
Everton, in contrast, have had a trouble-free build-up. Since Royle
took over they have won 15 and drawn 12 out of 33 games. They finished
in safety in the Premiership and now are poised for glory in the final.
Today Royle will be planning to curb United in midfield. He calls his
combative midfield men his ''dogs of war,'' and they will be sent out
snarling at Wembley in an attempt to destroy United's engine room.
The game could be won or lost in that vital area.

FEW championships in the history of the Torrie Stockbrokers Men's
National Hockey League have produced such an enthralling title race as
this season's campaign.
Grange go into the final series of games at Auchenhowie with a
two-point advantage over MIM and, with the matches being played
back-to-back at the Milngavie venue, a great day's sport is in prospect.
Andrew Kay, the MIM linchpin, was somewhat subdued this week when he
was looking ahead to the weekend card, but the former Scotland
internationalist feels that his side, by squandering a penalty in each
of their two games with Grange, ''have blown their chance.''
Kay stated: ''We will complete our programme by beating McMahon
Kelburne.'' But he went on to forecast: ''I think Grange are too good a
side to get beaten by Menzieshill.''
The Grange camp, by picking up four points from their two matches last
weekend, are now within sight of their first championship success since
1983. They have made great strides in recent years in the way in which
they have dovetailed young players like Gary Boomer and Andy McBride
into their side.
Scottish Cup winners Touche Ross Gordonians will be fighting for
divisional survival. They are three points adrift of the third-bottom
side, Edinburgh University, whom they entertain at Countess Wells, and
they must win to remain in the division.
But the students are at full strength and are all fired up for this
one and captain Gregg McAlister is confident.
* WESTERN Klick Photopoint have won the women's Torrie Stockbrokers
National League title for a record thirteenth successive season. This
time they required goal difference to keep ahead of Bonagrass Grove, but
goal difference was not enough to prevent their second string from going
into the divisional play-off.
They finished in second-bottom position in midweek when Boroughmuir
created an upset by holding Royal High Gymnasts to a 1-1 draw and so
Western today meet Melrose, who finished second to Menzieshill in
Division 2.
Western will be expected to get the verdict, for they have some superb
talent in their side including Lynn Forsyth, Sheila Miller, and a bright
young star, Jenny Morrice, one of Scotland's few successes in the recent
European Under-21 Championship qualifying tournament in Poznan.
* THE European Hockey Federation have awarded the finals of the 1999
European Club Championship to Germany. They will be staged at Hurth,
while the men's event will be hosted by Italy at Padua.

OVER the past two seasons, it appeared that Uddingston had turned the
corner. This term, they seem to have turned another, and found a dead
end.
Skipper Mark Watt returned last week but even big Wattie couldn't turn
his side's fortunes, their current standing in the DM Hall Western Union
showing three defeats from three starts, with no sign of improvement.
''For this season we've lost Harry Johnston, Riann Oosthuizen, and
most importantly, Gordon McGurk,'' complained the captain. ''That's a
bowler, a wicketkeeper, and two batsmen, and one of those is liable to
outscore many professionals during a season.''
Uddingston today face Poloc at Shawholm, a contest that pits Watt
against one of his old Drumpellier team-mates.
''We could be in for the Sajid Ali show again -- and knowing him, he's
probably been smiling all week at the prospect of what he's going to try
and do to us, and especially me,'' concluded Watt.
Drumpellier meet West of Scotland, Kelburne test holders Ayr, while
along the road Ferguslie meet Kilmarnock. Leaders Clydesdale are away to
challengers Greenock.

FALKLAND Palace contains the only court in Scotland for the playing of
real tennis, one of the attractions for thousands of tourists who crowd
the Fife village in summer. But today local thoughts will be about the
cricket side, who face their first Ryden East League first-division
match against neighbours Freuchie.
The sitting is picturesque Scroggie Park, where in recent seasons, the
recruitment of professional Manoj Parmar and SCU coach Terry Trewartha,
allied to striking improvements to the club facilities, have brought
them up to first-division status.
Champions Heriot's have made the best possible start, with three wins
from three outings. Enigmatic Stenhousemuir are their visitors and will
surely provide a stern test.
Watsonians will require to put much more backbone into their game if
they are to gain anything from the visit of Grange. Carlton are at
Raeburn Place in search of further success at the expense of Edinburgh
Academicals.
Royal High batted well in extending Heriot's last week, Manzoor Elahi
in particularly good fettle with a century. They may well be too strong
for Corstorphine at Union Park.

A SOUTHERN hemisphere equivalent of the Five Nations' Championship
took a step nearer yesterday after a meeting between officials of the
South African, New Zealand, and Australian unions.
After the gathering in Cape Town, the three authorities have agreed a
blueprint for competition at provincial and national level.
The meeting, attended by NZRU chairman Richie Guy, SARFU president
Louis Luyt, and ARFU chairman Leo Williams, also has agreed to form a
company to conduct commercial negotiations.Negotiations with potential
sponsors are at an advanced stage and that they will soon be concluded.
Whether the new Three Nations' tournament is connected with reports
that Rupert Murdoch is interested in spreading his media empire to
include coverage of rugby union is a matter of conjecture.

AFTER having won the first half of the World League season, the mighty
Amsterdam Admirals have taken the first berth in June's World Bowl.
Today, against Amsterdam, the faltering Scottish Claymores face their
own mini Bowl game, knowing defeat will eliminate them from appearing in
that showpiece final against the Admirals.
The Claymores could not have picked a more difficult situation with
their whole season on the line today facing the league's best, and so
far, only undefeated team.
Last week in Dusseldorf the Scots steamrollered their way to a 20-3
lead over Rhein Fire and looked finally to have broken their losing
habit at just the right time, with the league standings wiped clean for
the second half of the season.
But Claymores blew it in sensational style, giving up two touchdowns
in a four-minute spree of third quarter madness forcing the game into
overtime which the hapless Scots lost when kicker Shawn Conley fumbled a
punt attempt to set up Rhein for the winning score.
The defeat means the Claymores cannot afford to lose another game.
It's highly unlikely they will qualify for the World Bowl with a 3-2
second half record. Their only hope now is to sink the Admirals at home,
defeat Barcelona and Frankfurt in the following weeks, and then go to
White Hart Lane on the last weekend of the season for a final showdown
with the Auld Enemy, London Monarchs.
That, and hope Amsterdam win their remaining matches, and Rhein Fire
lose theirfixtures.
So it's high noon in Amsterdam's Olympic Stadium.
The Claymores valiant defensive line will have to put in one more big
day to pressure the league's top-rated quarterback, Jamie Martin and
prevent him from linking up with receiver David Jones and Scots-born
tight end Craig McEwan. Other fixtures:
Other fixtures: London Monarchs at Barcelona Dragons (7pm); Rhein Fire
at Frankfurt Galaxy 7pm.

HARPER'S memories are less than bizarre. Happy, in fact. The man born
in Guyana is in his third season as professional with Ayrshire, has
played with Blyth spirit in Northumberland, and has had four seasons
with Palm Beach Cricket Club in Queensland.
Despite all the sun, sea, and sand, David Harper had career-best
figures of six wickets for 17 runs against Forfarshire last week. He
bowled at medium pace, has caused problems with spin, and averaged 37
runs with the bat last season, so Arbroath County had better beware a
man in form when they visit Prestwick Oval.
Leaders Stirling entertain Forfarshire at Williamfield, trying to
maintain their successful start, albeit curtailed by the weather at
Mannofield last week.
Fifeshire have that threatening look about them this season, and they
should have few problems against Clackmannanshire at McKane Park.
Champions Strathmore could have quite a battle against a team who
threatened much last season, West Lothian, while Perthshire are showing
signs of a revival which could make Aberdeenshire's visit to the North
Inch less than comfortable.

Hiroshima,
AS of tomorrow, four more men will be able to regale their
grandchildren with stories about ''when I played football for
Scotland.'' The result of miscellaneous withdrawals through injury,
indifference, or involvement in domestic football matters means that the
names of Paul Lambert, Brian Martin, Craig Burley and Scot Gemmill
appear in the line-up for the first time for tomorrow's Kirin Cup match
against Japan in Hiroshima.
The spectacle of four uncapped players being introduced simultaneously
is unique in terms of Craig Brown's tenure as national team manager and
it may well be many years since a similarly fundamental restructuring of
the Scotland side was made. It has come about due to the lengthy list of
absentees, but Brown is trying to put his selection in the best possible
light.
''This is the first time I have picked four new caps for the same
game, but if anyone can tell me who else I should have brought in then I
would be grateful,'' he said. ''It is a bit of a risk but not as big a
risk as it might have been because three of them have vast experience at
under-21 level.''
Martin is being rewarded for his admirable patience as an unused squad
member in recent times with a debut at the age of 32, while both he and
Lambert were significant factors as Motherwell qualified to play in
Europe for the second successive year. Perhaps more intriguing however,
is the inclusion of the two Anglos, Burley and Gemmill.
The 24-year-old Nottingham Forest midfielder becomes one of those rare
players whose father also represented Scotland, in the case of Archie
Gemmill 43 times. The last man to follow in his father's footsteps in
this respect was Alfie Conn of Rangers and Celtic fame, when he played
against Northern Ireland in 1975 to match the solitary appearance of his
dad, also Alfie, the Hearts star of the 1950s.
''If Scot does half as well for Scotland as his dad did, then that
will suit me fine,'' said Brown.
In the past, Gemmill has been linked with a possible transfer to
Rangers. Burley, in much the same way, was reputed to be a Celtic target
at one stage, but it turns out that he is both relieved and happy to be
still a Chelsea player.
''As far as I know, Coventry made a bid for me a while back but
Chelsea said I was not for sale. I heard that there was interest from
Scotland when Lou Macari was at Celtic, but nothing came of that,'' he
said.
''It has been a great experience playing under Glenn Hoddle for the
past couple of seasons. I have learned a lot.''
Even so, when Hoddle arrived at Stamford Bridge originally, Burley was
ignored for four months. Then he was given his chance, playing a huge
role in the club's run to last season's FA Cup final and he has remained
a regular this term during their European campaign which saw them reach
the semi-finals of the Cup-winners Cup. Now he could be set to make an
important contribution to the remainder of Scotland's European
championship qualifying campaign.
There was some concern last night that Martin might have to forgo his
first match for Scotland after he suffered a slight groin strain at
training in Hiroshima. He will be given anti-inflammatory drugs,
however, and should be able to make his debut as scheduled.
Before heading for training, the Scotland squad paid a respectful
visit to the cenotaph in this city which was devastated by the world's
first atomic bomb in 1945. The team:
Leighton, Calderwood, McLaren, Martin, Burley, McKinlay, Lambert,
Gemmill, McKinnon, Jackson, Spencer.

CAMELON'S management team of brothers George and Brian Fairley will
attempt to write themselves into the history books tomorrow by leading
the Falkirk side to their first Scottish Cup win.
While Brian tries to be in command from the dugout, brother George
will be in the heart of the Camelon defence. And on a day when Junior
players have a tendency to let the occasion get the better of them, the
man on the field may have a more vital role than the one on the
sidelines.
''It is a very good thing having George on the field,'' says Brian.
''He tends to be a calming influence on the players around him, and in a
cup final, that can be very important.''
Whitburn, who prevented Glenafton from achieving a record four finals
in a row when they beat them 3-1 in the semis, may think that their name
is on the coveted trophy.
Many top sides have been what could be described as sorted out en
route to the final, and in forward David Scott, they have a goal-scorer
who, if still in the mood, can be a match-winner.
Already this season, Scott has tasted success in a Scotland shirt and
he is desperate for more glory. ''Winning the Scottish Cup would be the
pinnacle of my career, and all the players at the club feel the same,''
he said.
''When a club has not won a particular competition, the players who
break that duck are always remembered, and we want to become a part of
Whitburn's history.
More importantly, however, the Scottish Junior FA are hoping that the
game does not throw up the chaos of last year's final when four players
were sent off at Ibrox.

GERONIMO, the 50-ft Scottish yacht bought to challenge for the
Admirals Cup, showed her potential yesterday evening when, crewed by
nine pupils from Lomond School, she headed the fleet into Salen on the
opening leg of the Isle of Jura Scottish Islands Peaks race.
Though headed by half the fleet out of Oban, Geronimo beat on a
north-westerly wind, through the fleet, to complete the 18-mile leg to
Mull five minutes clear of her nearest rival.
Behind the state-of-the-art vessel, a former Fastnet race winner
chartered from the Largs firm which is mounting the Admirals Cup quest,
were some of Scotland's leading skippers.
Second was the catamaran Two Hoots, skippered by John Offord from
Taynuilt, with the 50-ft Beneteau, Eos, skippered by Adrian Venzo
(Skelmorlie) just one minute behind.
Spartan in the extreme, and designed purely for speed -- Geronimo's
inside is not even painted because a coat of paint adds weight. The
fittings are titanium, and space rocket construction has provided a
double shell of carbon fibre laminate sandwiching one inch of plastic
foam to make the hull.
The outcome is a boat of just six tonnes against 20 tonnes for the
almost identically sized Eos.
However, Eos's two international hill runners, Robbie Bryson and
Dermot McGonigle, made an outstanding assault on Ben More to give their
yacht a 25-minute lead leaving Salen.
The race, the most gruelling on the Scottish sailing calendar,
involves 160-miles via Jura and Arran, to Troon. Teams of runners must
climb Ben More (22 miles/966m), the Paps of Jura (18 miles/784m) and
Goat Fell (18 miles/874m).

SERGI Bruguera has the chance of quick revenge against Goran
Ivanisevic as both reached the semi-finals of the Italian Open
tournament with comfortable victories yesterday.
Bruguera, who went down to Ivanisevic at the same stage of last week's
German Open, beat Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden by 6-4, 6-1 in his
quarter-final, while the third seeded Croatian defeated American
outsider Jeff Tarango 7-6, 6-4.
Ivanisevic, who has now reached the Rome semis for three successive
years, defeated Bruguera 6-4, 3-6, 7-6, in their semi-final in Hamburg,
but lost the final to Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine.
Bruguera, seeded eighth, disposed of the sixteenth seed in 66 minutes
and showed he has fully recovered from a knee injury which had disrupted
his season, before attempting to land a third successive French Open
title in little over a week.
But the Spaniard said he was not yet back to peak condition.
''I felt more comfortable playing in Hamburg and better playing this
week but I'm still not at 100 per cent,'' he said. ''I still have some
trouble moving on court. There is room for improvement.''
Ivanisevic, beaten in the Italian Open semi final last year and in the
1993 final, was given a shock in the first set as fellow left-hander
Tarango had three set points. But the American, ranked the world No. 86,
missed them all and was eventually overpowered by Ivanisevic, who served
16 aces.
In the bottom half of the draw, Austrian Thomas Muster will play South
Africa's Wayne Ferreira, who gave former Wimbledon champion Stephan
Edberg a real going-over, winning 6-2, 6-0. The game took only 57
minutes.
Muster, the seventh-seeded Austrian, overpowered No. 2 Michael Chang
6-3, 6-2 to extend his clay-court winning streak to 26 matches. Despite
a cold and sore throat, Muster put on an overwhelming display of
attacking baseline tennis that had Chang lunging for every shot.
Muster, who has already won four clay-court events this year, is
closing in on Mats Wilander's record of 31 consecutive clay-court match
victories in 1982-83. He also has established himself as a favourite for
the French Open, which starts on May 29.

SCOTLAND will play in Group 4 when they host the world championships
in Glasgow in 1997. This was made clear after their defeat by Canada
last night in Lausanne, Switzerland.
The Scots, who needed a win to prevent relegation, went down 4-1 to
the side coached by Scotland's Commonwealth Games gold medalist Billy
Gilliland.
Elinor Allen and Kenny Middlemiss produced Scotland's only point.
''That was probably the best match we've played all season,'' said
Middlemiss. However, the win was not be enough to save Scotland the
shame of a relegation.
''We have been in Group 3 for six years, ever since we were promoted
in our first world championships,'' said Scotland team-manager Fiona
McEwan, ''It is disappointing to go down now, when we fought so hard to
stay up in Denmark and Birmingham.''
Middlemiss came closest to taking another point when his mixed-doubles
game with Russell Hogg went to three games. But some nervy errors cost
them the match 6-15, 18-16, 13-15. Results:
Scotland 1, Canada 4. K Middlemiss and E Allen beat D Yung and S Deng
15-10, 4-15, 15-12; B Flockhart lost to J Dawson 15-18, 16-17; A Gibson
lost to D Julien 1-11, 5-11; E Allen and J Williamson lost to D Julien
and S Deng 5-15, 1-15; R Hogg and Middlemiss lost to D Yung and B Olynyk
6-15, 18-16, 13-15.

AS Russell Weir, the 43-year-old overnight leader, receded down the
scoreboard, pride of place after the second round of the Tartan Special
Scottish Professional Championship at Dalmahoy yesterday was taken
jointly by Scott Henderson, at 25 the Scottish assistants' champion, and
27-year-old William Guy.
Their totals of 139, five under par and no modest response to the
challenge set by the 6677-yard East course swept by a cold and blustery
north-west wind, gave them a one-stroke advantage over Andrew Oldcorn.
The holder, Andrew Coltart -- ''I'd rather be five strokes ahead'' --
threateningly shared fourth place on 141 with Sandy Stephen and Brian
Marchbank.
Henderson confessed to scoring better than he swung and he took the
sole occupancy of the bogey-free zone. Having at halfway been one and
two under respectively in his two previous appearances, the improvement
could be considered unsurprising and the lowest score so far could not
have been launched more positively.
Starting at the tenth, Henderson opened with three birdies. Although
he did not drop a shot to the card he had to do his share of scrambling
and if the rest of his round could not sustain that first fine rapture
he did make two more gains, signing off by hitting a No.1 iron safely
home at the long ninth.
Henderson would have qualified for the European tour last November
but, when a final round of 74 would have done, he took 80 with three
successive double bogeys.
Guy threatened to dissolve all the good achieved by three consecutive
birdies from the eighth by taking three putts, downhill and downwind, at
the fourteenth and three from the edge of the sixteenth. But he returned
to the gates of contention with two closing birdies.
In this championship he was runner-up to Sam Torrance at Erskine in
1991 and in the Northern Open, two years later at Nairn Dunbar, he was
second to Kevin Stables -- perhaps dress rehearsals.
Oldcorn gave his sports psychologist, Richard Cox, something to work
on to improve his concentration, sometimes distracted by the mere fact
of competing on home ground. ''It's less stressful than a regular tour
event,'' Oldcorn said. ''But it's still a demanding week and people's
expectations of you are high.''
In a strange sort of symmetry Oldcorn mixed a pot pourri of the good,
the bad and the ugly. He began each half with routine birdies at the
long first and tenth and finished each with two more. But he also had
consecutive bogeys going out and a successive bogey and double bogey on
the homeward half.
Coltart, by his own calculations, missed only two greens in
regulation, but he was frequently some way from the flagstick, no crime
in these awkward conditions, and he was left with more awkward putts for
par than holeable ones for birdies. Under no pressure, he will now ''go
out and see what happens''.

139 -- S Henderson (Kings Links) 72, 67; W Guy (Buchanan Castle) 69,

* GLASGOW Lions, Scotland's leading amateur American Football team,
bid for their seventh Capital Bowl title at Meadowbank tomorrow. And
Lions will be boosted by the presence of some players who have World
League experience with the Scottish Claymores, Scotland's first
professional outfit.
Four players on the Lions' roster -- Steve McCusker, Paul Balfour,
Gary McNey and Pat Shields -- were all with the Claymores earlier in the
season, but have been cut by the Murrayfield-based side. But Lions owner
Alasdair Beaton points out: ''These players have played against the best
and are now very confident.'' Lions face Fife 49ers in their opening
match, and Clydesdale Colts take on Dundee Whalers in the other
semi-final. The final is due at 4pm.

MORE than 500 people from as far apart as Selkirk and Inverness will
be taking part in free coaching clinics at Craiglockhart, Edinburgh,
next week.
The clinics will take place alongside the Women's World Doubles Cup
competition, which goes on from Wednesday to Saturday and marks the
return of big-time tennis to Scotland.
The chosen 500 also will be able to watch play in the cup and the
accompanying Legends Tournament free, and they may also meet some of the
players.
The Lawn Tennis Association, who have organised the clinics, are
delighted with the scheme's success: ''It's been phenomenal -- we've had
nearly 900 applications and we'll have to expand the capacity for next
year,'' says organiser Rob Claridge. ''It's proved the demand for tennis
and tennis coaching is very high.''
Among the lucky participants will be members of the Rattray Tennis
Club in Perthshire, who will be at Craiglockhart all day on the opening
day. ''It's a wonderful package of coaching, women's tennis, and Legends
in a wonderful facility and we're really looking forward to it,'' said
secretary Joy Thomson.

MAYBE it is not always easy for people involved in sports which demand
self-interest by their very nature, but golfers of the stature of Nick
Faldo and Seve Ballesteros ought to be able to take a broader view than
most for the benefit of the game in general.
Happily, that seems to be the case this week when each has spoken out
independently about changing the European Tour to attempt to encourage
more competitive, and ultimately better, players to emerge from its
ranks.
Faldo's belief is that it is not a good thing for the game if players
can earn a comfortable living indefinitely in the middle division of the
Tour money-list without ever having to win anything. Whatever else he
could be accused of, and there is a lengthy list available, Nick could
never be considered short on ambition or the drive to achieve it, and it
is those qualities which he sees as being lost in what is being called
the comfort zone of the Tour.
''I guess in some cases it is too easy for a guy to make a nice living
and say he doesn't want to be a superstar,'' he said this week, adding:
''But we need new blood at the top.''
The Englishman points out that the leading European players, himself,
Bernhard Langer, Ballesteros, Ian Woosnam et al, are into their late
thirties without any serious sign of being overtaken. Even if he did
omit our own Colin Montgomerie and Spaniard Joe Maria Olazabal, the
general point remains valid.
It is one more example of Europe following the same pattern as
America, where the US Tour has become so rich a field of labour for
those who make it to that level that winning becomes incidental. The
progress, assisted by generous sponsorship, of golf tours to the current
status where the efficient can earn wages on a different plane from the
vast majority of the population has removed the hungry syndrome from the
sport's higher echelons.
That is not forgetting the players in the lower regions of the money
list who scramble for survival and are quite certainly in the ''hungry''
category. It is the above-average players who may not be quite as
motivated as their predecessors when they can be very well off indeed
without suffering the excessive pressures of the top-of-the-league men.
In that sense, ironically, the Tour has been too successful in
developing a highly rewarding working place for its members.
In the US, where the Tour spawned the great superstars of the post-war
era, the Hogans, Nelsons, Sneads, Palmers, Nicklauses and Watsons, the
conveyor belt now produces great players but no towering champions.
The development of the European Tour, may be a couple of decades
behind America, has thrown up our own great stars, already mentioned,
but where are the new ones? Have the few who might have reached that
pinnacle opted for the less demanding, uncomplicated and very
comfortable lifestyle of the follower rather than the leader?
Faldo would like the level of exemption lowered for membership of the
Tour to help make it more competitive. Seve wants a kind of promotion
and relegation system to and from the Challenge Tour, which is the first
division to the Tour's premier division.
What is certain is that some way of revitalising the game at the
highest level is required. Golf as a spectator sport needs the big
names, the star turns, the players who excite the masses, if it is to go
on attracting sponsors and television to the extent it does today.
Faldo and Ballesteros, who have made their contributions to European
golf, and then some, should be heeded. The European Tour has been a
magnificent development of the last couple of decades, during which Ken
Schofield and his predecessors have worked hard and willingly to build a
gravy train for its members. Now it may be time to slip into a siding
and re-establish where it is going.

COLOMBIAN super-featherweight Jimmy Garcia died in Las Vegas
yesterday, almost two weeks after having suffered brain damage in a
title fight with Gabriel Ruelas.
Garcia, 23, lost his fight for life at University Medical Centre,
where he had been on life-support systems since the May 6 bout. He was
stopped in the eleventh round and then collapsed in his corner.
Promoter Bob Arum said a drastic weight loss in the weeks leading up
to the fight may have contributed to Garcia's death. The boxer had to
lose 30lb in two months to make the 130lb limit for his bout.

THE feel-good factor is very much in evidence in the farming world,
according to both Mr William Waldegrave, UK Minister of Agriculture, and
his Scottish Office counterpart, Sir Hector Monro.
Both Ministers were in Perth yesterday at the town's Agricultural
Centre to speak to farmers. They were taking part in the Perth and
Kinross by-election campaign. A notably relaxed Mr Waldegrave commented:
''Farmers are doing well right across the board.''
Sir Hector in turn pointed out the current financial strengths of the
Scottish industry saying: '' We've had a vast increase in incomes which
have risen by 25% in the last year. Land values are increasing, tractor
sales are rising, bank interest payments are down substantially, and
arable farmers are getting #120m in area payments which were just not
there two years ago.
''Suckler cow subsidies have risen from #93 per head to #115 while the
Beef Special Premium has gone up from #97 to #114 and a hill farmer with
100 cows and 1000 ewes will get #14,000 subsidy on his cows and #25,000
on his ewes.''
Responding to a question raised by many farmers in the market of how
long this era of high subsidies could last, Mr Waldegrave said: ''There
will inevitably be reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy but I think
we are looking at something over 10-15 years.
''The first indication will be a fall in consumer prices as GATT
begins to cut all prices. But I would stress that the British farmers
have little to fear. Their structure of farming is good and if the
transition is managed successfully we can lead the world.''

UK fertiliser manufacturers are concerned that the European Commission
is moving too slowly in dealing with the dumping of Russian ammonium
nitrate fertliser.
A variable duty, to achieve a minumum import price, is being discussed
by the Commission. However, as the debate goes on, imports have vastly
exceeded the Russian undertaking to observe a limit of 100,000 tonnes
into the UK.
The Fertilisers Manufacturers' Association is asking for all such
imports to be officially registered, with a view to duty being
retrospectively applied. ''This would prevent the Russians continuing to
benefit from their failure to honour an agreement,'' said FMA
director-general Barry Higgs.

THERE are business challenges and business challenges. How would you
cope with a challenge on the following scale? In December 1993, your
main raw material was priced at $390 a tonne. Next month the price of
that same raw material hits $925. A near 140% rise in just 18 months.
And there's talk within the industry that the $1000 tonne can't be far
away.
I describe this particular scenario with real feeling. The raw
material in question is pulp for papermaking. The figures quoted are for
the benchmark pulp -- long fibre softwood craft. Such spiralling
increases do not just impact on the price of newsprint and the future
profitability of the newspaper industry from which I draw my living.
They affect everyone who makes paper and Scotland has a particularly
rich and diverse, if under-reported, papermaking sector.
This week I talked to one paper mill executive about that and other
challenges he faces. I last visited Neil Henderson at Guardbridge near
St Andrews in the late eighties, when pulp prices were rising steadily,
but at a more sustainable pace.
''In the period 1985 to 1989 we had 16 or 17 quarterly increases,'' he
recalls. ''In the recession which followed, the price of pulp went down
from $840 to $390 almost as quickly as it is rising now. I've been in
this business 30 years and price swings on this scale are totally
unprecedented.
''Commodity paper prices tend to go up and down with the changes in
pulp prices. But we are at the fine paper end of the market and our own
prices have tended to be much more stable.''
The $100 a tonne increase Henderson faces in June is the third this
year. His company, James River Fine Papers, has already responded with
significant price increases of its own in March. But he is acutely aware
that, since emerging from this recession, customers have remained
extremely price sensitive. So, although order books are bulging thanks
to buoyant demand, Henderson worries about the second half of this year.
''Margins will definitely be squeezed,'' he predicts.
To counter that, the Guardbridge mill (GB Papers) and its sister mill
(Wm Sommerville) at Penicuik will have to do more of what they've been
doing throughout the recession -- product innovation and a sustained
offensive to capture market share. That approach kept the business
profitable throughout the toughest years. The challenge now is to
maintain that record.
Henderson has another major challenge on his mind right now. Last
October his American parent, James River Corporation, gave him an even
bigger management task. He is no longer just chief executive of JRC's
two Scottish operations. He now has executive responsibility for the
group's Curtis Paper Division, with mills in Adams, Massachusetts;
Newark, Delaware; Ypsilanti, Michigan; a cast coating plant at Richmond,
Virginia, and warehousing and distribution in Philadelphia.
All this to be run from Guardbridge, next door to the Leuchars
airbase. At 56, Henderson is now at the helm of a business with annual
sales of #100m and around 1000 employees, split roughly equally between
Scotland and the US. He is in the unusual position of being able to
compare and then influence similar businesses operating in two
contrasting business cultures.
And, from July, in a demerger reminicent of ICI/Zeneca, James River
Corporation is to split in two, with four of its paper divisions,
including fine papers, to be floated off in a new, yet-to-be-named
independently listed vehicle, with annual sales of around $1000m, 11
manufacturing sites and more than 4000 employees.
James River, which started on the acquisition trail as recently as
1969, from just one speciality mill, now has 116 manufacturing
facilities in the US and Europe, nearly 34,000 employees and annual
sales of $5417m. With the demerger of its four papermaking divisions,
James River will concentrate on its consumer products businesses --
disposable towels and tissues, cups and plates, sanitary products and
packaging materials.
In this fundamental corporate shake-up, Henderson emerges as one of
four divisional chief executives, working to a group CEO in the demerged
company, the only non-American in the team. ''I've told them I am
definitely not moving to the States,'' he says with a determined smile.
Henderson believes the 1984 acquisition of GB Papers by James River
was the most significant thing that ever happened to the Fife mill. ''We
were a very efficient manufacturing operation even then,'' he explains.
''But that deal gave us the quantum leap. Americans are very good at
product development and marketing and, through them, we were able to
overlay a marketing expertise on this business which wasn't there
before.''
American ownership also brought exposure to more sophisticated
management tools for examining every aspect of costs, a whole range of
ratios designed to pick up the warning signals early.
''It's not rocket science,'' says Henderson. ''But they have
fundamental ways of analysing the business we didn't have before.'' That
said, he believes the resilience of the Scottish end during the
recession -- profits touched bottom at #3.4m in 1993 and have since
bounced back to a record #5m last year -- is essentially due to
incredible attention to detail and the sustained impact of a whole
series of incremental improvements in every aspect of the business.
''It's a very Scottish approach,'' he says. ''There's no miracle about
it. But a lot of people talk about doing it. The difference is that
we've made it happen here.''
His span of control also allows a lot of internal benchmarking across
the mills in the fine papers group. The 1984 acquisition of GB Papers
was followed in 1989 by acquisition of the then-quoted but family-run Wm
Sommerville. Now Henderson's control of the Curtis mills across the
Atlantic extends the opportunities to benchmark. ''On the basis of
synergy,'' he says of the Sommerville acquisition, ''two plus two has
made five or even seven. They had some very good customers and products
we didn't have.''
WHAT of the oft-vaunted American lead on manufacturing efficiency over
Europe, I wondered. ''The mills here are at least on a par with the
mills there,'' he says emphatically. ''In the early days as part of
James River, my boss said: 'This company is in pretty good shape but
we've got to get it so wound up it does less well, rather than a badly,
in a recession.' That's what's happened.''
The Scottish operations have a 6% market share in Europe in text,
cover, writing and security papers, the sectors where fine papers are in
demand. ''But we're right up there at the top in terms of profitability,
return on sales and return on assets,'' he adds.
But, to get back to our starting point, how is Henderson going to
contend with this upwards spiral in the price of his main raw material?
The central drive is to increase market share. While 70% of sales from
the two Scottish mills are still in the UK, Continental Europe -- now
accounting for half the remaining 30% of exports -- is the fastest
growing market.
The business is also responding to the hard fact that more customers
emerging from recession this time appear to be downgrading their
requirements permanently to more middle market product ranges. Before
Christmas James River Fine Papers launched Retreeve, a recycled text and
cover range with premium attributes, sensitively priced in the mid-range
and only available through distributor Robert Horne. ''It's the most
successful product launch we've ever had,'' says Henderson. ''We call it
affordable excellence.''
He goes on to explain that the development of the new brand was
effectively a joint venture with Horne, and he believes that may be one
way ahead for his sector of the business. He is also convinced there is
market share to be won through emphasising the business's green
credentials. ''We see ourselves as a leader in our industry on
environmental issues,'' he adds. ''And we are doing that because we have
fundamental beliefs that that is the way to go.''
Neil Henderson intends to retire in four years. One possible
successor, the son of a founder of James River Corporation, was
tragically killed by a former employee with a grievance last October in
his Richmond office a week after Henderson took on his expanded role. So
succession planning is yet another challenge for him. ''What we did in
1984 was turn a good Scottish company into a very good one. But there's
still plenty to do to make it better.''

''PITIFUL'' is how Martin Haggarty of solicitor Henderson Boyd Jackson
described his five-a-side team's performance in the annual football
tournament for the trophy put up by his firm.
The law firm lost two games and drew one in its own tournament while
Royal Insurance was runaway victor in the final beating General Accident
4-1.
Hearts star Dave McPherson came along to The Pitz in Townhead,
Glasgow, to present the trophy to the winners and say a few words of
consolation to the losers.
Haggarty, claims manager at Henderson Boyd Jackson, admitted
afterwards: ''It was a pitiful performance by us but the event was a
great success.''
Never mind, it is your tournament, which means you are guaranteed a
place next year, and you can always give yourself a chance of winning by
choosing weaker competitors.
Take my advice when issuing next year's invitations: steer clear of
Eagle Star, Commercial Union, Sun Alliance, Direct Line and Provincial
Insurance who participated this year, and you can always tell this
year's finalists Royal Insurance and General Accident that it's your
ball, and to go away and play with their own!

* Until I recently started receiving state pension I had been
collecting unemployment benefit. In addition, I managed to get some
temporary work last year but I have now had a tax demand for this which
amounts to nearly #250. Is there any way I can avoid this as I would not
have taken the job if I knew tax would be demanded?
* The Inland Revenue can waive arrears where they have arisen as a
result of an error by its staff, but in the circumstances you describe
this seems unlikely. It is probable your state pension, earnings and
unemployment benefit added together have exceeded your tax allowance for
the year and the demand you have received is in respect of the excess.
Tax charged in this way is usually payable in four instalments but the
Revenue is often willing to accept payment over a longer period in cases
of hardship. Your best course would be to discuss the problem with your
tax office.
* I have a number of shares from my company's option scheme and these
are worth approximately #13,000. As the capital gain on these will
exceed the annual allowance, is it possible to gift some to my wife so
they could be sold by her and we would have the benefit of two
allowances?
* Assuming this is a standard Inland Revenue approved savings related
share option scheme, the normal income and capital gains tax rules will
apply. Under such a scheme no charge to income tax arises on receipt of
the share option or on any increase in value of the shares between the
date the option was granted and the date exercised. This relief is
withdrawn if the option is exercised within three years.
If it is exercised after the three-year period, the base cost of the
shares for capital gains purposes will be the option price paid. Once
you become the beneficial owner you are free to dispose of them by sale
or gift. A transfer to your wife is exempt from capital gains but she is
deemed to have acquired the shares at your original cost not the market
value at date of transfer. You would then both be entitled to the annual
capital gains exemption and, based on the figures you quote, no tax
would be payable.

GLASGOW Brightsiders' Phil Birch, who leaves with the Scotland team
for the European championship qualifying tournament in Lugano tomorrow,
is also the only Scot in line for selection for the British team for the
World Student Games in Japan in August.
But, because of work commitments, the 6ft 5in Paisley University
student will almost certainly have to turn down the Japanese trip. Birch
was a member of the British team who finished ninth in the last World
Student Games in Buffalo, USA, two years ago and featured strongly in
coach Dan Lloyd's plans.
However, the 25-year-old electronics engineering student is sponsored
by Honeywell and, as part of his contract, has to work during his

FLORENCE Descampe, who is to be married in three weeks, surprised
everyone yesterday when she fashioned a course-record 67 to take the
halfway lead in the American Express Ford Classic at Chart Hills
yesterday.
The Belgian hit nine birdies -- four in a row from the fifth -- and
finished the day at eight-under-par 136 to lead by two from Britain's
Lora Fairclough and Susan Hodge, with Julie Forbes leading the Scottish
challenge on 144.
Forbes, winner of last year's French Open, birdied the second and
third, dropped her only shot of the day at the fourth, then birdied the
short seventeenth. Leading scores:
136 -- F Descampe (Belgium) 69, 67.
138 -- S Hodge 68, 70; L Fairclough 70, 68.
140 -- C Hjalmarsson (Sweden) 71, 69; K Webb (Australia) 70, 70.
141 -- T Loveys 68, 73; D Barnard 71, 70.
142 -- E Orley (Switzerland) 72, 70; S Prosser 72, 70; E Knuth (Spain)
69, 73; T Johnson 71, 71; S Waugh (Australia) 74, 68.
Other scores included: 144 -- J Forbes 74, 70. 145 -- D Reid 72, 73.
146 -- L Davies 73, 73. 147 -- K Marshall 74, 73. 148 -- M McKinlay 73,
75. 149 -- G Stewart 77, 72. 151 -- T Craik 77, 74.
Non-qualifiers included: 154 -- C Panton-Lewis 76, 78. 156 -- L Irvine
78, 78.
* HILARY Monaghana and Sharon McMaster will contest the final of the
Scottish Ladies' Amateur championship at Portpatrick Dunskey today just
a season after having clashed in the same event at Gullane.
Last time around McMaster was a first-round winner, yet Monaghan
displayed she had graduated to greater things only last week across the
same stretch of testing linksland when she lifted the East Lothian
County Championship against the Dunbar player at the first extra hole.
Results:
QUARTER-FINALS
S McMaster (Dunbar) beat C Hargan (Cardross), 1 hole; A Hunter
(Innerleithen) beat H Stirling (Bridge of Allan), 1 hole; H Monaghan
(Longniddry) beat C Hunter (Deeside), 7 and 6; L Nicholson (Haddington)
beat A Rose (Stirling), 1 hole.
SEMI-FINALS
McMaster beat Hunter, 1 hole; Monaghan beat Nicholson, 3 and 2.

LEN Lungo, who paid 25,000 guineas at Doncaster to keep Attadale in
his Dumfriesshire yard, will be out to win the feature race, at Hamilton
Park this evening with Noyan.
Ten days ago the five-year-old battled on under the strong driving of
Kevin Darley to beat 6-4 favourite Mentalasanythin by three-quarters of
a length at the Lanarkshire course.
Tonight they take each other on again in the Draught Guinness Handicap
over the same distance of a mile and five furlongs. Despite a four
pounds penalty, Noyan, with Darley in the saddle, is just tough enough
to come out on top again.
Noyan is owned by Mr Hal McGhie of Lochmaben, whose colours were also
carried by Attadale until Thursday evening's sale.
The seven-year-old son of Ardross will go chasing in the autumn but
with a new owner.
Diet, who sprinted in at 14-1 at the last meeting to give Linda
Perratt her first success of the season, could do it again in tonight's
opener when he carries only eight stones eight pounds in an apprentice
handicap.
No-one can accuse Duns trainer Tom Kemp of being afraid of the big
yards from down south. Despite the presence of Michael Stoute's
three-year-old Embracing, owned by Maktoum Al Maktoum, in the Arthur
Guiness Maiden Stakes Kemp will run his newcomer Glenrock Dancer.
Embracing just failed to win at Thirsk two weeks ago when he was
beaten a neck and will almost certainly start a short-priced favourite.
The first five days at Hamilton Park have seen an increased attendance
of 20%.

YOU can't keep accountants Douglas Kinnaird and Frank Blin apart.
Earlier this week their fresh features appeared beside it each other on
The Herald business pages, Kinnaird's because he has decided to strike
out on his own to form MacDonald Kinnaird, a business development
consultancy, and Blin's because he has been appointed managing partner
of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Scotland.
What most Herald readers would not know is that the pair have spent a
large chunk of their lives together. They were in the same class at
Hutchesons' Grammar from primary five onwards and then studied
accountancy at Strathclyde University.
''We both qualified as chartered accountants at different firms,''
said Kinnaird, ''but we still meet frequently though Hutchies, and last
year sat on the committee together which helped raise money for a new
science block at the school. It was ironic that our career developments
should be reported side by side in The Herald on the same day.''
A third Glasgow accountant, Marshall Miller, managing partner at
Touche Ross, was also in the same class as Kinnaird and Blin, which
means that there should be no difficultiy tracking down the maths
teacher to blame for any mistakes in the additions columns.
Czeching out
opportunities
EARLIER this week Bill Brown, European partner of Maclay Murray &amp;
Spens, chaired a European Business Group seminar aimed at helping
Scottish companies do business in the Czech Republic.
More than 50 turned up for what was the second in a series organised
by the Business Group to provide information and support for companies
developing business links in Central and Eastern Europe. The next one,
scheduled for September, will cover Hungary.
Brown, who divides his time between Brussels and Scotland, told
Business Diary: ''We are targeting as a priority those countries which
are economically more developed, where there are a wide range of
opportunities for Scottish businesses.''
The European Business Group was formed by Strathclyde Regional Council
and includes in its membership SFE, Royal Bank of Scotland, Scottish
Engineering and Scottish Enterprise.
Red faced over
famous name
THERE was much hilarity among the 500 guests at the farewell dinner in
Edinburgh for Scotland's Rugby World Cup squad when the announcer of the
raffle prizes called Miss Karen Snowden to come forward, and Karl
Snowden strode up to receive the goodies with hands outstretched.
Snowden, who is head of Allied Dunbar's Professionals' Business
Division, told me: ''When you have a name like mine, these
misunderstandings come with the territory. When I was at school and the
teacher called out 'Karl' myself and three girls stood to attention.''
The fact that he spent his schooldays in Cardenden in the Fife
coalfields leads many to assume his name is a throwback to the heady
days when the red flag flew over most of the area and Willie Gallacher
was the Communist MP for West Fife. Wrong. He was given his name by his
father Gordon who was a card carrying member of the Communist Party
while serving in the Royal Navy. ''My father came from Yorkshire but my
mother came from Fife, which is why at the age of 10 we settled down
there.''
Does being named after Karl Marx cause any problems for a city gent
Business Diary speculated. Not at all, he replied, pointing out that
people forget that one of the founders of Allied Dunbar was South
African solicitor Joel Joffey who defended Nelson Mandela, and that the
company sets aside 1.25% of its pre-tax profits for charitable purposes.
High price of
behaving well
DON'T misunderstand me, I have the greatest respect for the Institute
of Management, but I couldn't help smile when I spotted the contents of
The Influential Manager course it is organising at the Stirling Highland
Hotel on November 6 and 7.
According to the short course programme the workshop will include
''making a good first impression; essential dos and don'ts, and
behaviour skills which get action''. After the workshop participants
will have learnt how to make a good first impression, and how to choose
the best behaviour strategy. The cost of this two-day charm school? A
mere #470 plus VAT for members or #520 plus VAT for non-members.
Charming.
Fishing for
sub relatives
HARRY Davis of Harry Ramsden's fish restaurant in Glasgow would like
to hear from any relatives of survivors of the Lusitania which was sunk
by a German submarine 80 years ago this month.
The restaurant has a five-foot-long model of the ship on display at
the moment thanks to the Glasgow Maritime Museum, which is campaigning
for the refurbishment of the Govan Graving Docks area as a site for the
museum and a home for the MV Glenlee at present languishing on the other
side of the Clyde.
Derek Statt, the other Harry Ramsden director in Glasgow, is on the
steering committee of the museum, so any relatives of Lusitania
survivors might find a wee fish tea waiting for them if they contact the
restaurant.
Banking on a
great birthday
WE draw ever nearer to the Bank of Scotland's official 300th birthday
on July 17 and the bank's 15,000 staff will all be having their own
little birthday parties to celebrate.
Branch managers have been told they can spend #30 a head on their
staff to mark the occasion, and each person will also be receiving a
gift, such as a crystal decanter or rose bowl, from the bank.
It is also putting #3m back into the community through sponsorship of
the arts, sport and education. However, even a 300-year-old is not dotty
enough to try and reward two million customers directly, although a
cheery spokeswoman reminded me it had frozen its charges for several
years.
Racing to enjoy
a fun day out
HANSEL Village in Ayrshire is looking forward to a good day at the
races on June 1 when the Hansel Village Selling Stakes will be part of
the card at Ayr.
There will be #3500 of prize money at stake in the flat race, but
Hansel hopes to win from the charity bets donated by local bookmakers
and also the celebrity dinner in racecourse's Eglinton Suite. Johnny
Beattie will be MC and racehorse trainer Linda Perratt and vet Cliff
Botcherby will speaking. Hansel Village expects more than 100 guests to
attend. Anyone interested in tickets should contact Judith Young on
01563 830340.

* Like many small savers, I have put a lot of my precious savings into
unit trusts, looking for a return over the medium to long term. I have a
portfolio, most of which was purchased before 1990, which was
recommended to me by a financial adviser in a reputable company. The
units are in Murray Johnstone Smaller Companies, M&amp;G Japan and General,
Fidelity European, Allied Dunbar Asset Value, and MIM Britannia Income
and Growth.
The return has been no greater than I would have obtained from a
building society, and the first two trusts have been exceptionally poor
performers. Dipping my toe into capitalism has, therefore, been a bit of
a disappointment. Would you recommend that I dispose of any of this
portfolio, particularly the two worst performers, or would I be wise to
hang on to the lot? If I do sell, where do I go to get reasonable advice
about what to purchase?
* The nineties have so far been a difficult period for investors, with
the markets shaken by the recession and high interest rates, the Gulf
crisis, the ERM debacle, and latterly the rise in US interest rates.
We do not doubt your observations, though presumably the overall
performance has been undermined by the two laggards. Smaller companies
have been out of favour for much of the period, though this may be
ending now. Japan, once the darling of international investors, has
suffered from its worst post-war economic setback.
Sell the two trusts which have disappointed you most, but this would
not be the right time to switch funds from equity-type investments to
cash. Your adviser chose a preponderance of specialist vehicles for you,
but such a strategy needs constant monitoring.
You would be safer redeploying the funds you realise in one or two
general investment trusts such as Alliance Trust in Dundee, Baillie
Gifford's Scottish Mortgage in Edinburgh, or the Foreign &amp; Colonial
Investment trust in London. In all cases shares can be purchased through
the fund managers' investment schemes where transaction costs are low.
Better luck this time. In future if investments are letting you down,
don't wait so long to take remedial action.
* I have approximately #60,000 in a share portfolio which is held in a
nominee account by Sharelink. I understand the benefits of my shares
being held in a nominee account but I am worried about the risk of
losing money, especially as I see that the price of Sharelink shares
fell sharply earlier this year.
Could you advise me what would have to happen to Sharelink before I
lost money? How likely is this to happen? Would you advise me to spread
my shares across two nominee accounts with two stockbrokers, giving each
#30,000?
* Sharelink has recommended its shareholders to accept a takeover bid
from Charles Schwab, an American discount broker which has proved highly
successful in its home market. This has been reflected in a fivefold
rise in its share price in five years, which should be reassuring.
In fact, nominee accounts are ring-fenced from the company's trading
activities and the shares they contain remain in the name of their
beneficial owner. The only real risk comes from the possibility of fraud
which, of course, can never be totally ruled out. Compensation, if it
ever became payable, would be limited to #48,000, so if you are worried
you should have two stockbrokers as you suggest.
* My daughter who is in her thirties has lived and worked in South
America for 15 years. She works for a UK firm and a percentage of her
salary is paid into the Abbey National five-star account every month.
The firm has recently agreed to make a contribution if she desires to
open a pension plan here in the UK. She wishes to know which schemes
exist for someone in her situation. I have been told that her money
would work much better for her in an off-shore investment. Could you
comment please?
* Your daughter's best bet is to have an offshore savings account, the
money in which would roll up tax free. If the company insists on a
formal UK personal pension plan this would not actually make much
difference because the fund would still roll-up tax free under current
legislation and contributions would be gross. But the offshore route
would be preferable as the fund will not be locked up until retirement,
as it would be in an onshore pension plan, so preserving greater
flexibility.
Abbey National has offshore accounts available, but as it is a
long-term investment you may want to consider equities. Guinness Flight
has a good track record in both its UK and international equity funds.
If you prefer lower risk you could consider a bond fund such as
Kleinwort Benson's gilt fund, or a currency fund.

ABBEY National has launched a five-year guaranteed bond offering a 7%
net return, equivalent to 9.3% gross, paid quarterly for five years, or
42% net after five years' growth. There is an extra 0.4% on amounts
invested by May 27. Minimum investment is #10,000.
Unit trust PEP from Abtrust
ABTRUST is offering a unit trust-based PEP for regular income. It will
be invested in three of the group's investment trusts -- Fixed Interest,
which invests in corporate bonds and yields 9%, Investment Trusts, which
has a target yield of 9%, and Extra Income, which pays 6.3%. Investors
can make their own choice of the three funds, save that for the moment
the Fixed Interest fund is not fully PEPable. It is, however, expected
to become so shortly.
Skipton offers new car plan
SKIPTON Building Society has a new car purchase plan available which
allows payment to be spread over two or three years at a typical APR of
10.6% with a minimum deposit of 10%. The car has to be ordered through
Skipton and at the end of the period customers have three options. They
can hand it back, buy it outright by paying a final amount fixed at the
outset, or order another one. Extras such as a maintenance contract, and
accident, illness or redundancy insurance can be arranged with premiums
added to the single monthly payment.
Birmingham Midshires PEP
BIRMINGHAM Midshires Building Society has launched a PEP to be managed
by Sun Life, with an initial charge of 3% and an annual charge of 1.5%.
It carries no exit charges.

* On the maturing of an endowment policy with Clerical Medical two
years ago I left #21,000 in their funds, the bulk in the Emerald fund. I
am disappointed by the performance and would like to move it. In
addition, on retirement at 64 I will receive a lump sum of approximately
#18,000 and a pension of #145 a week. Could you suggest where to place
the money so I receive a regular rate of return and am able to withdraw
#1000 to #2000 a year.
* The Emerald fund invests in bonds and other fixed-interest
securities and has suffered from the fall in these last year. It has
under-performed the average for its sector, so it is not a bad idea to
look elsewhere.
Your requirements equate to a yield of some 7% gross (5.2% net) on
your available funds together with some capital appreciation, a tall
order if you also want a low risk. It could be obtained through a
low-cost PEP, for example the Alliance Trust scheme which involves
putting #1500 into Alliance itself and the balance into another
qualifying trust. If this was invested in Merchants' Investment Trust a
net yield of 5.1% would result. However, this would account for only
#6000.
Further sums could be invested in corporate bond and convertible unit
trusts, moving them into PEPs in subsequent years. You could put more
into investment trusts but this should be balanced by some risk-free
investments, such as National Savings' Income Bonds and the Pensioners'
Bond when you reach 65. You might also consider Government securities.
Treasury 7.25% 1998 yields 7.4% gross and will give a marginal capital
gain on maturity.
If all this is too complicated stick to National Savings and the
Treasury stock (which can also be bought through National Savings) and
accept you will have to lower your income expectations if you want to
maintain your capital. Dunfermline Building Society's three-year
Escalator Bond is also attractive, yielding 8.3% overall.

middleweight boxing title in the Brunton Hall, Musselburgh, on June 1.
The lad from Worcester will be ambushed by the Family Quinn, a gathering
of relatives and friends of Willie, the challenger from Tranent,
supported by a 1000-strong fan club -- a quire of Quinns, if you like,
backed by the Quinn choir.
Dad, Tommy, who did a wee bit of boxing in his day, will have sold
most of the tickets himself by then. Mum Ella will make sure all the
boxers on the show come home to Tranent for dinner. His sister, Kerry
Anne, and girlfriend Karen, will carry the ring cards between rounds,
and brother Tommy, who is boxing in the show next month, is his sparring
partner.
The piece de resistance, however, is Gran. A lady in her 70s, she
sells the programmes and is a loud and fervent supporter of her grandson
when he is in the ring. In other words, Paul, if Willie doesn't get you,
Granny will.
This will be the man inevitably known as The Mighty Quinn's first
chance at winning any championship, amateur or professional, and it is
an opportunity he is determined to take. In 17 fights he has lost only
one, the first, but has since beaten that conqueror twice, and has never
been on the deck.
It is when you examine some of his other activities that it becomes
clear why this affable 23-year-old does not carry much fear into the
ring with him. Any man who has survived the rigours, if that is the
right word, of life as a male stripper, might reckon facing a couple of
Mike Tysons something of a dawdle.
Willie did that to earn extra cash when he was about 19 just after he
turned pro, but he had to give it up...''too many late nights''... even
if he recalls wistfully that going round the clubs brought good money.
His pals in Tranent, rather than give him a hard time over his night
job, pestered him to get them similar bookings -- ''Can ye no' get us a
job?'' -- and Karen accepted it as part of life with Willie.
He has also done a fair bit of male modelling, fashion shoots and the
like, none of which seems to the casual observer to go hand in hand with
the bloody, brutal business that goes on inside a boxing ring.
It is also an incongruous combination of a lifestyle dependent on his
looks allied to one where preserving them is well nigh impossible. The
Quinn of 17 fights wears little facial evidence of ring damage, although
his nose is just beginning the spread that leads to the fighter's
trademark. When we spoke he also sported a black eye -- ''I have had to
keep my hand up when I talk to people in Tranent. They have never seen
me with a black eye.''
Clearly a young man whose good looks and physique could have taken him
in an entirely different direction, Quinn accepts that, in pursuing his
boxing career, he is virtually certain to spoil the asset which might be
his fortune elsewhere. His answer to that is uncomplicated. ''I like
boxing. I want to be a world champion and I believe I can do it.''
He admits that it is only when he goes into the ring that he gets the
adrenalin flowing freely, a ''buzz'' that nothing else can supply. He
admired Sugar Ray Robinson as a youngster but his only real ambition has
been to make money. Again, it sounds simple eough the way he says it:''I
wanted to become a millionaire.''
Willie has a long way to go yet before that status is acquired but he
is such a fitness fanatic that he could travel some distance towards his
goal in the next couple of years. Unlike some fighters, he finds no
drudgery in training and in fact loves the whole business of getting and
staying fit.
It was that fondness for fitness that helped him carry on when many a
young man might have been discouraged after losing his first fight to a
boxer called Mark Jay.
''That just made me all the more determined because I knew I had to
work even harder as a pro than I had done as an amateur.''
Under Tommy Gilmour's guidance he has now gone on an undefeated run
that has forced his manager to rasie the stakes. ''I see this fight as
my big chance.'' says Quinn, ''I saw in the paper that Busby called me a
plodder. I'll show him who's a plodder.''
Quinn hopes a win over Busby will set him up for higher level contests
and he is confident he will cope with it. ''I know you can only make it
by giving 125% every time and I am prepared to do that.''
He is not foolish enough to consider carrying on in the lower regions
for too long. ''It is a short life and you have to make as much as you
can and then get out. If I don't make it in a few years I will not hang
around.''
He has stopped 11 of the 16 fighters he has beaten and, although not a
one-punch boxer, is so supremely fit that his overall strength can wear
opponents down.
He says Gilmour thought long and hard about giving him this fight
against a much more experienced boxer but Quinn has assured the gaffer
he has nothing to worry about. Willie gave up his printer's job last
year to concentrate all his efforts on the boxing...''I found it too
hard to travel to Glasgow daily for my job and then go to training as
well.''
He is aware of the risks, aware of the controversies that recent
tragedies have brought to the sport and acknowledges that he does worry
about hurting an opponent seriously. ''Obviously we are in there to do
our business but I hate to see anybody in a bad way at the end of a
fight.''
For a man who has patently taken care of his body and been heavily
into physical fitness most of his life, Quinn is honest enough to admit
he was no good at sport as a schoolboy. ''I was hopeless at football and
never much good at anything else but I did like PE.''
If Karen accepted his stripper days without complaint he is in no
position to object to her parading around the ring between rounds. He
wouldn't have dreamt of it, anyway. ''She was persuaded to do it by
Kerry Anne and she enjoys it. It's funny at times. I can hear guys
saying to their pals when they are giving her cat-calls: 'You'd better
not shout at her, she's Willie Quinn's girl.''
Unlike the girls, Willie's mum is no fan of the fight game, certainly
when her sons are in the ring. ''She will come to the fight but she will
hide in the toilet. She can't watch.''
Granny is something else. ''She loves the boxing and you'll see her
right there among the young ones shouting and jumping up and down. She's
incredible.''
Dad has done his bit to make sure that every fight in his home ring
has been a sell-out. It is said he could fill the place with relatives
and friends.
It promises to be another noisy night in the Brunton Hall and Granny's
Army will be there.

SPORT enthusiasts, grown cynical at millionaire athletes enjoying
feather-bed treatment, will warm to a tale from the other side of the
tracks . . . of Scotland's three-man team of ultra distance runners led
by Willie Sichel, who earns his living as an Orkney wool farmer -- not
sheep, but shearing the fur off the backs of Angora rabbits.
Mere marathons are nothing to men such as Sichel who will string
almost two-and-a-half marathons back to back tomorrow when he makes his
Scottish debut, aged 41, at Nottingham in a 100k race. He joins Mick
Francis, from Moray, and Glasgow-born Norrie Williamson.
Though for Linford Christie, athletics can mean earning #250,000 for
10 seconds' work, running 100 metres, the reality for others is very
different. The ultra trio are paying for the privilege of representing
their country over 100k (62.5 miles).
The Scottish Athletic Federation is providing vests, shorts -- women's
ones, which the runners have had to modify -- and have paid the #10 per
head entry fee.
Otherwise the runners are expected to cover all expenses: travel,
meals, and accommodation. Given that Sichel is from Sanday, the cost is
substantial.
But it is even greater for Williamson. He has spent more than #600,
flying from South Africa to win his first vest on British soil.
''The organisers said they provided accommodation only for overseas
competitors,'' says team manager Adrian Stott. ''When they heard where
Willie and Norrie were coming from, they relented. We are staying with
some local athletes, so that has defrayed some of the expense.''
It takes a certain element of intensity -- some would say insanity --
to run ultras.
Training, for Sichel, a former Scottish international table tennis
player, can be a nightmare. ''The elements are against you here, but
that is part of the challenge,'' he said. ''In winter I generally need
three layers of clothing.''
''The wind-chill makes it about minus 20 degrees. I smear my face with
Vaseline, and wear a ski mask. I can train in anything under 80 miles
per hour. But at Force 10, I am standing still, so I pack it in. I am
lucky to be self-employed. I can train during daylight. Otherwise it
would be by torchlight, on the road.''
Sichel travelled from the south of England, to visit a friend at
Sanday, in 1982, and never went back. He fell in love with the place --
and the friend, Elizabeth. They are now married, with two daughters.
They lived in a caravan, bought and restored a ruined croft 300 yards
from the water. It has an uninterrupted view, on clear days, across 25
miles of sea, to Fair Isle.
''It has its compensations,'' says Willie. ''The air quality is
wonderful. We have a kitchen garden, for vegetables, and eight acres on
which we keep a couple of goats, and grow hay to feed the rabbits --
about 80 of them.
''I planned to work in the tangles, the seaweed industry, extracting
alginates, but there was lack of world demand, and the job folded up.
I'd kept rabbits as a kid, so thought I might as well give that a go.
''The rabbits are sheared four times a year, and that's how we make a
living. We used to spin our own yarn -- now that's done elsewhere. When
it comes back we dye it, and knit socks, hats, gloves -- all kinds of
thermal clothing.
''Unfortunately, Angora gear is no use for running in -- you get too
hot. We make warmers for every part of the anatomy imaginable -- we even
got asked to make a coat for a chihuahua!
Born near Market Harborough, he competed for Scotland at table tennis
due to the nationality of his father, who is from Glasgow. He
represented Scotland in the West German Open, in 1979, and the 1980
European championships, in Berne.
''I never wanted to lose a match through lack of stamina, so I ran
every morning. The coach, as a punishment, often sent us on five-mile
runs. I actually enjoyed them.''
He kept running after quitting table tennis, and last year, aged 40,
raced his first ultra, a 40-mile event on the Isle of Man, finishing
first Briton. ''When I crossed the line, I knew I had found my forte,''
he says.
In his debut 100k, last year, he won the Scottish title. He plans
three races at the distance this year and hopes to make the UK team for
the world 100k championships, to be held in Holland, in August.
Williamson also discovered his aptitude late. He was a 13-stone hooker
with Royal High School FP, and played under-23 representative rugby for
North and Midlands before moving, in 1981, to South Africa to work as an
engineer.
''On the flight out, I read about these two silly races -- the
Comrades Marathon (about 54 miles) and the Two Oceans race. Next thing I
knew, I was running in them.''
Now, 13 Comrades marathons later, and more than three stones lighter,
he is a full British ultra international, a member of the European
24-hour Challenge bronze medal team.
''I raced a 100-mile track event in Durban, and beat Derek Kay, the
former world record holder. That was in 1982. The next year I won a
1000k race in Pretoria -- 10 days of successive 100k races. I found that
the longer I went, the better I got.''
Last year, with Francis, and Don Ritchie, he was in the Scottish team
which won Commonwealth silver, in Victoria.
A former engineering lecturer, Williamson now works as a sports
administrator at a polytechnich for 7000 Indian and black students. ''I
used to be the only white guy there. Up until 1993, during aparthied,
all we had was non-establishment activities, and we struggled to get any
kind of unity in student sport. Now it is racing ahead.''
A qualified international coure measurer, Williamson has been invited
by the US track and field technical commission to address a conference
this summer. ''They're paying all expenses -- more than Scotland has
ever done. When I ran in Victoria, Scotland did pay my flight there, but
coming from South Africa to Britain was at my expense -- another #600.''
Whoever wins after 62 miles at Nottingham tomorrow will receive a
tropy, a medal, and a spontaneous burst of applause. Small wonder ultra
runners feel like athletics' second class citizens.

AGRICULTURE Minister William Waldegrave yesterday indicated support
for British Coal tenant farmers who claim they are being asked
unrealistically high prices for the purchase of their holdings.
During a visit to Perth Agricultural Centre he promised that he would
give the company a persuasive shove to put all their conditions on the
table, although he warned that he could not bully British Coal into
changing its mind.
The tenant farmers hope to demonstrate to the Government that the
price they are willing to pay exceeds any likely offer from a third
party.
The farmers believe that institutional investors would be unlikely to
offer more than 35% of the open market valuation -- buying the farms
with secure sitting tenants. As tenants they would be prepared to offer
in the region of 50% of the vacant possession price.
More than 40 tenants met in Kingseat, Fife, to discuss the next step
in their battle to persuade British Coal to reduce the asking price for
the 50 farms they are disposing of in Scotland.
Their hopes are now pinned on the wording of the Coal Industry Act
1994, which sets out the procedures for the winding-up of British Coal
and the disposal of its assets in the wake of privatisation.
John Dale, who is acting as legal adviser to the tenants, said that
British Coal was obliged, under the Act, to dispose of its property on
the best available terms. There was provision, however, for Government
ministers to express an opinion on what were the best available terms
and British Coal, under the legislation, was required to accept that
opinion.
The tenant farmers have agreed to try to use that clause to their
advantage by listing the prices they are prepared to pay for their
holdings and demonstrating to the Department of Trade and Industry that
their combined offer outweighs anything that could be expected from
institutional investors.
The success of their policy will hinge on whether the phrase ''best
available terms'' is interpreted solely on price. In addition to the
farms there are a further 8000 acres of land and other properties to be
sold off in Scotland. There would be scope for an institutional offer
covering more than the farms to be considered a better deal.
For a number of tenants time is running out. They were originally
given four weeks in which to accept the British Coal price and a further
two weeks if they were able to show material factors which suggested
that the valuations arrived at by land agents Bell-Ingram were flawed.
The advice to all tenants now is to state the price they are prepared
to pay and to back it up with comparisons citing prices paid for similar
holdings elsewhere. ''We must say 'this is our price and we believe it
is right. If it is wrong show us where it is wrong','' said Mr Dale.
British Coal has indicated a willingness to discuss ''relevant issues''
during that four-week period.
Brodie Wallace of Easter Bowhill, Cardenden, said that his
understanding was that Bell-Ingram was responsible only for the
valuations. The discount formula being used to arrive at a price was
determined by British Coal.
Tom Thomson, milk convener of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland,
and a British Coal tenant, advocated a group approach in which the
farmers made a united offer for the farms.
However, while some tenants are reaching a deadline for accepting the
British Coal price others have still be informed of the valuation for
their holding. British Coal claims that about half of those who have
received offers have accepted.

FARMERS who occupy boardroom seats in some of Scotland's leading
agricultural co-operatives have been challenged to become stronger
players in developing the businesses -- or to move over and make way for
younger men.
''Farmer directors who fail to 'direct' their chief executive and who
stay too long in their elected or appointed position are not helping to
develop the business which, in theory, they are seeking to serve,'' said
Douglas Cargill, president of the Scottish Agricultural Organisation
Association.
''In some cases a farmer director who outstays his time in the
boardroom is actually restricting the development of the business
concerned by denying space for someone with fresh ideas and
enthusiasm.''
Mr Cargill was speaking at the SAOS co-operative directors' debate in
Aberdeen which drew an audience of 85 farmer directors representing a
combined turnover of more than #700m. They were asked to consider
whether farmer-run businesses should invest in added-value processing or
concentrate on creating strong selling organisations, leaving the
processing of farm products to others.
Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, argued the case for a
strong selling co-operative. ''We all recognise the strength and power
of the big supermarket buyers,'' he said.
''The challenge for us as farmers is to put ourselves in a strong
enough position to be able to say no when a supermarket buyer makes
unreasonable demands. Without that strength as primary producers we will
constantly be driven to even lower levels of return.''
It was a sobering thought, he said, that while a farmer would often
need three years to implement a change in production, a food
manufacturer could change direction in about three months and a
supermarket chain could clear its shelves of a product and re-stock with
something else in about three days. ''That is the market in which we are
operating and in which we will only prosper if we have strength of our
own making.''
The case for farmers investing in processing was argued by Professor
Gert van Dijk, director-general of Holland's National Council of
Co-operatives. For him the key to increased farmer strength lay in
leadership. ''In the Netherlands our leading agricultural co-operatives
are spending about #10,000 per person on training for senior farmer
directors,'' he said.
''An investment of that degree buys a package in which a director
joins 15 others in an 18-month training programme. The training is
intensive and the results are impressive.
''Even our smaller co-operatives are regularly spending #1000 per
person each year on training for their farmer directors, and I see no
reason why co-operatives in Scotland should be any different.''

CREDIT card customers are cheering some good news that has arrived
just in time for the peak holiday spending months -- but card issuers
are looking on warily.
Earlier this week most major issuers agreed they would be responsible
for paying up if something a cardholder ordered or bought outside the UK
turned out to be faulty or never arrived.
At the moment the agreement is voluntary and applies only to purchases
made on or after last Monday, May 15. Some smaller card issuers are not
party to it, but they are likely to follow suit. This voluntary
arrangement is expected to be replaced by new legislation within the
next 18 months as part of a shake up of consumer credit legislation and
follows proposals from the Office of Fair Trading.
''We're delighted,'' says the Consumers' Association. ''What the
agreement means is that if you buy, say, a faulty camera in Hong Kong on
your credit card you will be able to claim the money back from your card
issuer without having to contact the retailer abroad. Also, if you order
something from abroad using your credit card and the supplier goes bust
before delivering the credit card company will reimburse you.''
Under the 1974 Consumer Credit Act you can, within certain limits,
make a claim from your credit card company if something you've paid for
with your card turns out to be faulty or is never delivered. When that
Act came into force hardly anyone used their credit card overseas --
Access, for example, could only be used in the UK. And card issuers
believe protection was never meant to apply worldwide.
Nevertheless, they have now agreed to shoulder some of the liability
for compensating customers, in return for several concessions. The most
important is that their liability will be limited to the amount spent
using the card.
Andrew Waldman, director of card services at the Royal Bank of
Scotland, says: ''The proposals strike a balance between the wish of
consumers to enjoy abroad the additional protection offered by credit
card transactions, while avoiding the imposition on the industry of the
additional costs of open-ended liability for overseas transactions.''
Under the existing legislation credit card companies could be liable
for the full value of a faulty item or service costing between #100 and
#30,000 even if a card had been used only for a deposit or initial
payment.
''Our nightmare was that someone might pay for medical treatment in
the USA using their card, but that we might then become liable for huge
payouts if that treatment went horribly wrong,'' says Chris Tucker at
Barclaycard. ''Now we know for sure that our liability is limited only
to what has actually been spent using our card.''
Proposals from the Office of Fair Trading recommend that the card
issuers' liability applies only to single items costing the equivalent
of at least #100, but no more than #25,000.
Another concession is that credit card issuers can now try to recover
the money they've paid out to cardholders from retailers or insurance
schemes. At the moment the retailer and the card company are both
equally liable for claims but, in the UK, it is the credit card issuer
who normally picks up the bill when, for instance, a retailer goes out
of business and customers lose their deposits.
Some card issuers believe the new agreement puts them at a competitive
disadvantage with overseas card companies which don't have the same sort
of worldwide liability. ''We are being asked to underwrite the risks of
dealing with retailers throughout the world,'' says Ian Lindsay at
S&amp;P/Robert Fleming. ''But I do welcome the proposals to limit our
liability to the voucher amount.''
Card issuers have paid out large insurance premiums over the years to
guard against the possibility of potential claims from their
cardholders. Now their liability is clearly defined these may fall.
But hopes that lower insurance costs could lead to a cut in interest
charges or yearly fees look forlorn. Card issuers fear that there is a
large potential for fraud, with cardholders and overseas retailers
colluding to make money out of the compensation UK credit cards now
offer worldwide. ''The saving in insurance premiums we stand to make
won't be as much as the higher overseas payments we could now have to
pay,'' says Mr Lindsay.

MANY people nowadays are facing a dilemma. They are becoming
increasingly aware that they should save more for their retirement
because of the diminishing value of the state pension. But after recent
controversies, they are wary of traditional pension arrangements or find
that they do not meet their needs. The result is many people are putting
off a decision about their pension or saving too little too late.
There is nothing magical, though, about saving for retirement.
Membership of a good occupational pension scheme to which an employer
makes contributions on your behalf should never be turned down, but
paying your own premiums into a personal pension or topping up a company
scheme with additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) is not necessarily
the only way of boosting your retirement income.
Worth considering as an alternative or for at least part of your
retirement savings is a personal equity plan. A fact sheet explaining
the pros and cons of unit trust PEPs compared to pensions has recently
been published by the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds.
Tax advantages are offered by personal pensions, AVCs and PEPs. With
pensions the benefit is more immediate, but it is debatable whether this
produces the greatest long-term gain. For flexibility, PEPs are clearly
in the lead.
The main attraction of a pension plan is that you can get tax relief
upfront on your contributions at 25% if you are a basic rate taxpayer or
40% if you pay higher rate. With a PEP there is no immediate tax
benefit. But in both cases your money is invested in a tax-free
environment.
When you get to retirement, you are allowed to take around a quarter
of your pension fund as a tax-free lump sum but the rest, which has to
be taken as income, will be taxed at the going tax rate at the time.
This could, of course, be higher than it is now. With a PEP, on the
other hand, you can take your money out as a lump sum or as income free
of tax, so you are protected against a future rise in tax rates.
There are more restrictions on pensions. For example, once you have
put money into a pension scheme you will usually not be able to get it
out again until you reach retirement. For anyone who is uncertain about
the security of their job and feels they may need cash to fall back on
earlier, this may seem too inflexible.
A PEP should also be regarded as a long-term investment. You should
aim to set money aside for at least five years, but you can get your
money out earlier without sacrificing the tax benefits and in most cases
without penalty.
Another advantage of PEPs is that you are not locked into the same
investment manager. Although it is possible to shift your money between
pension providers if your company's performance is not up to scratch,
you will often be penalised. Moreover, it is not always easy to judge
just how your pension plan is performing. The investment results of unit
trusts are much easier to compare and switching from one manager to
another is straightforward and usually penalty-free.
The contributions you can make to both PEPs and pension plans are
limited. You can save between #10 and #500 a month, or lump sums of up
to #6000 a year in a unit trust PEP. With a personal pension, the amount
you can save depends on your age and income. The problem is that if you
have not got an earned income, you cannot contribute to your pension
plan. This makes life difficult for people who are between jobs or
taking time off because of family responsibilities. In such situations a
PEP is often the only sensible answer.
When you get to retirement, you are also restricted as to how you take
your benefits from a pension. Part of it can be realised as a lump sum,
but the rest has to be used to buy an annuity to provide an income.
Although it is intended in future that policyholders will have greater
flexibility over when they buy their annuity, the fact remains that once
you have done so there will be no capital sum left for you to pass on to
your children.
With a PEP you will have the money available at retirement to provide
yourself with an income, while retaining control over your capital to
dip into if you need it as well as to leave to the next generation.
There is a risk with this strategy. If investment returns are poor, your
capital could shrink causing your income to fall, whereas an annuity
income is guaranteed for life. But if you spread your PEP investment
around, you can minimise the risk and could even enjoy further growth.

DESPITE the worries over interest rates -- which exist whether you are
the Bank of England Governor wishing they were higher or a borrower
wishing they were lower -- the stock market has been plodding slowly
upwards.
Currencies may be a concern and the pound too cheap, but UK
manufacturing exports are doing well and the consumer has hardly gone on
a buying binge with demands for ever more expensive imports. The trade
gap has not been attracting dramatic headline attention for some years
but, for what it is worth, current estimates are that this year may see
the first UK current account surplus since 1985. The figure could be
around #3000m.
So the fund management industry is feeling reasonably confident about
the UK stock market. The May survey of institutional sentiment carried
out for broker Smith New Court found a balance of 29% of managers
planning to raise their exposure to UK shares compared with only 7% last
October. Skipping lightly over the awkward question of why so many of
these wise people were wrong in October, the point is that when a nice
balance of fund managers decide they like our market it should, all
things being equal, continue to do reasonably well.
Concentrating on the fact that the FTSE-100 index is thought likely to
rise to around 3500 by the end of the year, the question is: how do we
benefit by this?
One possibility is to buy an index tracker fund. Most of these track
the All-Share index, but that may do at least as well as the Footsie as
it includes more of the manufacturing companies which are still a
favoured area. Alternatively, there are plenty of unit trusts
concentrating on the UK market where you get the actual value of real
shares. Or you can look at investment trusts where, because of the
discount (where there is one), you get a little more in the way of
shares than you actually pay for.
Smith New Court's investment trust analysts Charles Cade and Philip
Middleton have been pondering all this on behalf of investors who agree
with them that although the Footsie has already risen 200 or 300 points
in the past few weeks it could well rise further. The broker's strategy
team is also recommending being ''overweight'' in the UK.
It is a comfort to those investors, and there are a fair number, who
prefer to stick to home grown companies which are easier to keep track
of and whose shares are quoted in sterling.
So how do you find an investment trust to give you ''cheap'' exposure
to the UK market? The analysts say that at first sight this might seem
an odd question as there are numerous trusts with assets in the UK.
However, they point out that these are internationalist generalists with
a substantial proportion of their assets overseas. Also ''many of the
trusts with a high UK content have a yield tilted portfolio, and those
which do not are often small with poor liquidity''.
Eliminating trusts with a capitalisation of less than #100m on the
ground that the market in them might not be particularly liquid, they
looked through the remaining list for those with a UK content of more
than 80%. There were 15, but this was reduced to eight by going for
capital growth and cutting out those offering a yield above the
All-Share index average of just over 4%.
That list included 3i which was eliminated as it invests mainly in
unquoted companies. Three others, Hoare Govett Smaller Companies,
Fleming Claverhouse and Schroder UK Growth, were all trading at around
asset value, so while they should benefit from a rise in the market they
did not offer the extra opportunity of a narrowing discount.
There remained four -- Edinburgh, Fleming Mercantile, Govett Strategic
and Throgmorton. All have been changing recently and the choice between
them depends in part on whether you prefer large or smaller companies.
Edinburgh fairly recently stepped up its UK content from a traditional
66% or so to a little over 90% and has been reclassified as a UK general
trust. This, say the analysts, should mean it tracks the All-Share index
more closely in future -- the trust's stated objective is to beat it --
and there could be potential for the discount to narrow. But they
suggest the trust, which promises a minimum UK content of 80%, would get
a better rating if it raised the minimum or went the whole hog and
invested fully in the UK. It is the only one of the four concentrating
on larger companies.
Fleming Mercantile has also changed. Last year its strategy was
altered to focus on quoted UK small and middle capital companies. Its
quoted overseas assets have been sold, but it still has 11% in unquoted
stocks which it hopes to reduce. The quoted portfolio is around half in
smaller companies and the rest in middle sized, but the latter
proportion is expected to be raised later in the economic cycle. It
could, say the analysts, ''out-perform the All-Share if smaller
companies come back into favour''.
Govett Strategic, the most highly geared to the UK market, is
overweight in smaller companies and its price may be more volatile than
the index. It also has a wind-up date of September next year.
Speculation on its future ''is likely to have a significant impact on
its discount''.
Throgmorton invests in small capital stocks and a recent change meant
it sold most of its large stakes in unquoted companies. It has now
''overcome most of its historical difficulties largely associated with
unwise diversification''. The analysts see ''no reason why the trust
should under-perform on a total returns basis.''

Tripoli, Friday
LIBYAN leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi said the men suspected of
planting the Lockerbie bomb would not stand trial ''until Judgment Day''
-- unless Israel complied with UN Security Council resolutions.
Building on Arab anger at Israel grabbing more land in Jerusalem
earlier this week, Gaddafi told Libyan veterans that the two Libyans
accused of blowing up a PanAm jet over Lockerbie in 1988 were ready to
face trial in the West if Israel carried out some 40 council resolutions
passed against it.
If Israel did not do so, he said, the men suspected of planting the
bomb which killed 270 people would not stand trial until ''Judgment
Day''.
Security Council resolutions against Israel include recommendations
that it withdraw from occupied territory, refrain from changing the
status of Jerusalem, and treat the Palestinians in accordance with the
Geneva conventions on people living under foreign occupation.
Israel has dismissed some resolutions out of hand or has interpreted
them in a way shared by no other government.
The Security Council imposed sanctions against Libya in 1992,
including a ban on flights into or out of the country, after it failed
to hand over the two suspects for trial in either Scotland or the United
States.
''Gaddafi announced that the two Libyan citizens who are suspects are
willing to go to America or Britain if the Israelis carry out all the
resolutions which the Security Council has passed against them,'' the
Libyan news agency said.
''Let what they call Israel implement the 40 resolutions and then
Libya will implement the resolution which the Security Council passed,''
it quoted Gaddafi as saying.
''Otherwise we will not implement the Security Council resolution
passed against Libya, not until the day of Judgment.''
Britain and the United States in the past have rejected all Libyan
proposals which fall short of unconditional compliance with their
demands.
During the Gulf crisis of 1990 and 1991, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein made a similar attempt to link withdrawal from Kuwait with
Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian land.--Reuter.

BUILDING society figures showing the first year-on-year decline in
gross mortgage lending since August 1993 have been followed by a gloomy
forecast from top analysts in the City.
Stockbrokers UBS has slashed its forecast for this year from an
increase in house prices of 6% to just 3%, and warned that the housing
recovery would not be in full swing until 1997.
Main reasons for the cut in its house price projections are the
Government's plans to reduce income support for mortgage interest,
announced in November's Budget and due to be implemented in October, and
the lacklustre performance of the market since the autumn.
Rob Thomas said the weakness of the housing market ''owed a good deal
to the blow to confidence caused by the Budget announcement on income
support for mortgage interest as well as declining mortgage tax relief
and the general fragility of consumer confidence''.
UBS now expects transaction this year to be only 2% up on last year at
1,300,000, down from its previous projection of 1,400,000.
Some recovery is expected next year with prices forecast to increase
by 6% and transactions to rise to 1,450,000.
''The housing recovery should be in full-swing in 1997 with house
prices rising by 10% by the year-end and turnover at 1,700,000,
representing a 17% rise on 1996's figures,'' said Mr Thomas.
Gross mortgage lending by building societies fell from #3193m in March
to #2649m last month. In April last year the figure was #2944m. Net
lending dropped from #1067m in March to #671m, 32% lower than in April
of last year.
Net new commitments fell from #3666m in March to #2889m, 8% lower than
in April last year and 9% lower than in April 1993, suggesting no
imminent recovery in lending.
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
said: ''April's lending figures were disappointing, but reflect the
general lack of confidence in the market at present.
''Gross lending suffered its first year-on-year decline since August
1993. Net lending was substantially lower than last year and represents
the largest year-on-year fall since August 1993.''
The continued poor state of the mortgage market was exacerbated by the
current economic environment. There was general concern over rising
interest rates and continued falls in house prices also added to
uncertainty in spite of very strong affordability.
''The increases in personal taxation and the reduction in mortgage tax
relief, both implemented in April, will have impacted upon disposable
incomes during the month, further reducing confidence,'' Mr Coles added.
Net receipts of #868m were the highest for two years and compared with
#520m in March and #376m in April last year.
Mr Coles said: ''While rumours of mergers within the industry may have
affected savings behaviour recently, societies have now attracted strong
inflows for 10 consecutive months.''
Building societies have faced little competition from National Savings
and Mr Coles claimed that the poor performance of unit trusts might
reflect a change in savings preferences.
The April money supply figures pointed to continued strength in
lending to companies, suggesting a sustainable recovery in capital
spending was underway. Lending to consumers was also strong.
M4 lending by banks and building societies grew by #4700m against
#8700m in March when the figures were boosted by the impact of Glaxo's
bid for Wellcome. This had a far smaller effect in April.
Overall M4 increased by 0.3% in the month with the annual rate
slipping to 5.4% from 5.3%. The Bank of England said that M4 rose by an
annual 4.5% in April, if the Glaxo takeover is excluded.
In the City the weak lending figures from the building societies,
which followed Thursday's unexpected fall in retail sales, were seen as
giving the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, further
ammunition if he wished to hold out against Bank of England pressure for
higher interest rates.
James Capel's Adam Cole said: ''The chances of Clarke ignoring the
Bank's call for higher rates are clearly increasing.''

PRESIDENT Jacques Chirac started his term of office last week with all
the customary republican fuss of investiture and two journeys, both of
them charged with political symbolism.
The first, early one morning, was to Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises, burial
place of General de Gaulle, where the newly-elected President paid his
respects at the great man's tomb and thereby reasserted his right to
assume the Gaullist heritage.
The other trip, on Thursday, was to Strasbourg for a meeting with
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, intended to leave opinion and at home and
abroad in no doubt that President Chirac had assumed his European
responsibilities, too.
In a foreign policy speech in March, Mr Chirac, once an agnostic in
European matters, underlined how much importance he attached to a solid
Franco-German alliance at the heart of Europe. Everyone had expected him
to be quick off the mark in meeting Chancellor Kohl. From a practical
point of view he could not have been any swifter -- an hour or so after
the announcement of a new French Government in Paris, the two men were
together.
The public relations aspect, organised by the president's 32-year-old
daughter, Claude Chirac, who is in charge of press relations at the
Elysee, was brilliant. The divorce between the people of France and
their government had been a constant theme of Mr Chirac's election
campaign and Thursday's message was one of simplicity and directness.
Apparently against the advice of his security men, the president was
driven to a military airport for the flight to Strasbourg, a mere
three-car escort and with none of the Tricolour flags, sirens, or
outriders which normally accompany presidents on the move. President
Chirac even stopped at traffic lights on the route, along with everybody
else.
In Strasbourg the hour-long meeting between President Chirac and
Chancellor Kohl was fired by a hearty dinner -- snails, onion tart,
calf's head, and lots of beer at Chez Yvonne, one of the best
restaurants in the city.
Mr Chirac's mixture of political sonnets and homely gastronomy was
aimed at reassuring Germans worried by seeing the first Gaullist since
President Pompidou to take over the Elysee and unnerved during Mr
Chirac's campaign, by the promise of a referendum on the single currency
and the political pre-eminence of former anti-Maastricht campaigner
Philippe Seguin.
Mr Seguin has no job in the new government and President Chirac swears
his European policy will continue that of President Mitterrand.
President Chirac again dismissed reports in Le Monde, which had upset
the currency market, that the franc could be devalued within the
European Monetary System. Just what might happen to the franc after the
presidential election had long been the subject of conjecture.
German opinion should also be reassured by the presence of so
committed a European as Alain Juppe in the job of Prime Minister. So
should the Foreign Office: ''Juppe is a star,'' was the judgment of
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who was in Paris last Monday to talk
with his French counterpart about Bosnia just before he was upgraded to
Prime Minister.
The premier in Fifth Republic politics has often been a dispensable
shield for the president, but the relationship between President Chirac
and Mr Juppe is closer and longer-standing than any of those that has
preceded him.
Traditionally, the president also retains the upper hand in foreign
policy. After Mr Juppe's brilliant two-year spell as Foreign Minister,
it seems more than likely that the Prime Minister, too, will have his
own words to say. Any important decisions, such as a future withdrawal
from Bosnia, for example, are likely to be taken by Mr Juppe rather than
his Foreign Minister, Herve de Charrette.
The only disappointment President Chirac can have experienced in
Strasbourg was the absence of concrete support from Chancellor Kohl as
regards his own top priority, the fight against unemployment. President
Chirac repeated after that meeting that with 3.3 million officially
unemployed in France, ''the very heart'' of his policy ''and the motor
of all his decisions'' has to be getting people back to work. Brilliant
public relations and gastronomic diplomacy is one thing: President
Chirac now has to deliver.

ABBEY National has formally made its takeover bid for the National &amp;
Provincial Building Society with a letter from chief executive Peter
Birch handed to N&amp;P chief executive Alastair Lyons just after midday
yesterday.
In a brief statement confirming the move, Abbey said that although the
terms of the proposal remain confidential, it is confident that N&amp;P's
staff, customers and members will benefit from the proposed merger.
The Bradford-based society with more than two million members
predictably played a straight bat.
National &amp; Provincial said it had received a number of proposals from
potential partners including Abbey National. It is committed to to
examining all of objectively to decide what is in the best interests of
members. Given their differing nature it is not possible to say at this
stage how long the process will take.
Mr Lyons still shows signs of unhappiness about the way in which Abbey
announced first to the world and then to N&amp;P about its intentions. He
said N&amp;P would seek to minimise the period of uncertainty created by
Abbey's unilateral action.
An Abbey spokesman said the hostility had been exaggerated but there
seems little doubt that a tactical mistake has been committed and that
the N&amp;P board will give any other serious contender a more favourable
hearing.
Other names in the frame include the Clydesdale, a subsidiary of the
National Australia Bank and eager to build up its presence in England,
the two other Scottish banks as well as the Alliance &amp; Leicester,
Nationwide, and Woolwich building societies.
Foreign banks seeking to develop a UK retail presence could find the
building society takeover route relatively painless.
It is believed that Abbey could be offering around #1100m which would
work out at about #650 for each member.
That is about three times what would have been on offer when Abbey
made its first approach 18 months ago.
Merger with another society, and therefore maintain mutuality, is
probably N&amp;P's preferred choice. But it faces demands that it must make
public the details of all the serious bids and not hide behind
legislation such as the Building Societies Act.
Any cash payment to members may be worth more to them than the concept
of mutuality.

Johannesburg, Friday
SOUTH African police said today they had uncovered a fraud syndicate
linked to the IRA which had raised #40m to back a hostile takeover of
three diamond companies.
''There is a very strong link between the syndicate and the IRA . . .
not just personalities in the movement,'' said investigating officer
Sergeant Gert Britz.
''The IRA's motive is financial, definitely -- but at this early stage
we can't say to what extent it would have benefited,'' said Britz, a
detective with the police Commercial Crime Unit in Cape Town where the
scam was first uncovered.
Johannesburg police spokesman Lieutenant Jan Combrinck told a news
conference that the syndicate had operated for almost two years in
Johannesburg, Cape Town, London, Pretoria, Geneva, and in Ireland. He
did not say in which Irish city.
''The man we suspect is the leader of the syndicate has definite links
with a very prominent figure in the IRA who is involved in the fraud.
Once we have enough proof we will be in contact with Interpol,''
Combrinck said. He refused to identify any of the people involved.
''It is not just personalities. The syndicate has close links with the
IRA itself which has helped the syndicate bribe banking officials to
effect the transfer of blue-chip share certificates which were stolen
from nine companies.
''The money they raised would have been utilised in the hostile
takeover of three diamond companies in South Africa,'' Combrinck said.
He declined to name the IRA man, or the companies and banks involved,
saying it would jeopardise further investigations.
The police have issued warrants of arrest for 13 people -- South
African, British, and Irish -- suspected of involvement in the
syndicate.
''They are big-timers, mostly prominent businessmen,'' Combrinck said.
''We have a very strong case against them, even at this early stage, and
the attorney general has already appointed an advocate to handle the
prosecution.''
Three people have been arrested and released on warning pending
prosecution.
''This is one of the biggest cases of its kind ever in South Africa,
and certainly the biggest one in which we have been able to make
arrests,'' Combrinck said.--Reuter.

RICHARDS, the Aberdeen-based carpet manufacturer, has moved back into
profit after closing or selling several of its loss-making factories,
but the company warned that trading conditions remain tough.
Richards reported a pre-tax profit of #405,000 for the six months to
March 31 after a loss of #1.62m in the same period last year. Sales rose
9% to #33.0m from #30.4m previously.
Chief executive Ray Dinsdale said sales had fallen off during the
first quarter of this year after a pick-up in the last three months of
1994, but the company still expected to stay in profit for the full
financial year.
He blamed the latest downturn on a further slump in the housing market
and the continuing lack of a ''feel-good'' factor among consumers.
''Carpets are a classic deferrable purchase. If people don't feel
confident they aren't going to go out and buy carpets,'' he said.
One bright spot an the otherwise gloomy scenario is the success of
Richards' new drive to sell carpets directly to home-owners.
Since March, the firm has been franchising salesmen who go from house
to house with video-imaging equipment that offers the potential buyer
with an exact idea of what the carpet would look like and how much he
needs.
''We have already covered over half our original target for the year
for Scotland. It is looking very encouraging,'' Mr Dinsdale said.
He predicted that franchise sales would be contributing more than #1m
per year to Richards' bottom line within two or three years.
Richards held its interim dividend unchanged at 1.07p, but its shares
were marked down 4p to 46p.

Helsinki, Friday
MEDIA mogul Rupert Murdoch, in Finland ''to beg for paper'' amid a
global newsprint shortage, vowed today that all the newspapers in his
News Corporation stable would soon be published electronically.
He warned, however, that it would take some time for the on-line
newspaper to catch on -- and although he said the electronic information
superhighway was rich with promise, he saw it putting an end to talk of
media monopolies.
Murdoch, whose newspaper, television, and film empire spans four
continents, also said he ''very honestly'' did not know yet if he would
make a bid for Italian billionaire and former Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi's three television channels.
Murdoch came to seek personal guarantees of long-term supplies from
Finnish paper marketing group Finnpap, which has supplied his family
with paper for decades.
News Corp buys 400,000 tonnes of Finnish newsprint a year and he
wanted 200,000 more: ''But it's all sold out,'' he said. ''I quite
understand that there are people who are desperate for paper.''
Murdoch said that within a couple of years all his publications would
be available online. ''Whether people will pay for them, whether people
will use them, we don't know.''
There are many possible uses of the electronic highway, Murdoch said.
''No-one yet has found a way to make a profit on it -- I believe one day
somebody will.''
He argued that the rise of electronic media could shatter current
media monoliths, making it easier to start newspapers on very little
capital.--Reuter.

WEIR Group, the Scottish-based manufacturer of specialist pumps and
valves, said yesterday that it expected trading conditions to remain
tough this year and 1994's tight margins could be eroded still further.
But the company, which is still digesting last year's purchase of the
US firm Envirotech, said prospects looked brighter for the second half
of the year and there were strong growth prospects in China and the Far
East.
''Our performance should strengthen as the year progresses and the
benefits of reorganisation begin to come through,'' Weir Group chairman
Lord Weir told the company's annual general meeting in Glasgow.
Lord Weir said the company expects ''weaker earnings per share in the
first half of the year followed by a stronger performance in the second
six months''.
Margins on engineering products fell to 6.8% last year from 7.5% in
1993 and chief executive Sir Ron Garrick said margins could fall a few
more ''points of percentage rather than full points'' in 1995.
''The situation is certainly not any better than it was last year, so
I think we will see a bit of pressure,'' he said.
Weir Group shares fell 4p to 242p in reaction to the cautious
forecast.

THE days when people shopped until they dropped are long over. But
there still remains overcapacity in the retail sector despite the many
bankruptcies during the recession.
Consumers are cautious in their spending. This is reflected in the
latest building society figures for April showing record retail savings.
Consumers continue to seek value for money in all product categories.
This colder retail climate is affecting both small and large retailers
even those that are efficient and offer attractive products such as WH
Smith.
Its shares were decimated yesterday when it issued a warning saying
that pre-tax profits for the year to June 3, before exceptional items,
are likely to be less than the market expects at around #115m. That
compares with #124.8m last year and City expectations for as much as
#142m.
However, it intends to maintain its final dividend at 10.4p making a
total shareholders' payment for the year of 15.65p, just 1.6% ahead of
last year's full-year dividend. The results are due to be published in
August and will contain a provision of about #12.5m for redundancies,
property closures, disposal costs and write-offs in its business
supplies chain.
The profit warning prompted shares in WH Smith to immediately lose 11%
of their value dropping 46p to 370p. They succumbed to further weakness
in later trading, slumping 65p to 351p in busy trading of 6.3 million
shares.
''With a profits warning coming from somewhere which is not at the
luxury end of the market this will certainly have people thinking deep
thoughts about the whole retail sector,'' said one City trader.
The profits shortfall was blamed on lower trading profits in its WH
Smith High Steet retail chain. By the end of April, sales were 1.3%
below the level recorded last year and profits are expected to be down
18% to about #14m before group central costs.
At the interim results in January, it was already apparent that WH
Smith in the High Street was being hit by deflation in stationery and
greetings cards and was facing growing competition for its newspaper
sales from other retailers most notably the big supermarket chains.
This all comes at a time when the chain is being expanded with the
addition of around half a million square feet over the next few years. A
move away from basic commodity products and into new markets are seen as
the way forward together with more advertising. For instance, by
September, 50 multimedia departments are to be rolled out and 100
children's departments by Christmas, but it will take time to reposition
the business.
However, chief executive Sir Malcolm Field said he was ''confident
that we will produce a significant improvement in performance as the
programme rolls out''.
WH Smith's other retail interests include Waterstones bookshops, Our
Price and Virgin music businesses and Childrens' World. These specialist
retail brands are said to be performing strongly. Waterstone's sales for
the 11 months to April were up 6.4% and Virgin/Our price sales were
14.4% ahead in the same period.
The WH Smith announcement fed through to the shares of other similar
retailers such as Kingfisher, owner of Woolworths, down 17p to 458p and
John Menzies, 2p cheaper at 537p.
However, Ranald Noel-Paton, group managing director of John Menzies,
said the group remained confident that its results for the year to April
29, due to be published on July 3, will be satisfactory. However, the
company is undoubtedly feeling the retail heat.
In a statement issued yesterday, it said that ''circumstances are
undeniably tough'' and drew attention to the disappointing national
retail sales figures published by the Central Statistical Office earlier
this week.
The latest casualty of the competitive retail market is Reject Shop,
the furniture chain specialising in basic home furnishings and furniture
aimed at first-time buyers and students.
Its owner, department store group Upton &amp; Southern, has told National
Westminster to appoint receivers. Upton said the decision had been
reached after a series of discussions on the structure and financing of
the chain.
Upton has been seeking to raise extra finance to ensure that trading
at its other divisions is unaffected by the receivership. Upton acquired
31 Reject Shops in February 1994 but in April said the chain had made an
operating loss of #1m in the six months to January 29, which had dragged
down overall group profits.
Reject Shop found it hard competing against better retailers in its
markets such as Habitat, Ikea, and smaller chains such as The Pier.
However, it is not all doom and gloom in the sector. Next continues to
power ahead benefiting from improvements to merchandise and well
executed marketing initiatives.
At its annual general meeting, chairman Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale
said that trading in the current year continues to be satisfactory.
Sales this year are about 16% ahead of last year in the High Street
chain and 27% better in Next Directory.
Since the start of the new financial year, the gross buying margin has
been reduced by around 1% as part of its strategy of further improving
quality and value for money.
Some recovery in consumer confidence is expected later in the year as
lower unemployment leads to higher wages and people get the benefits of
windfalls from building society takeovers.
However, the legacy of higher taxes, a sluggish housing market,
coupled wth the attractions of the National Lottery, all mean that there
is unlikely to be a consumer boom. Therefore, there could be further
retail disappointments in the months ahead.

SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric has agreed to buy nearly a third of the gas
from BP and Texaco's offshore Erskine Field once it comes on stream in
late 1997.
Hydro-Electric said it had agreed to purchase ''substantial
proportion'' of the output from Erskine, which received development
approval from the Department of Trade and Industry last week.
The Perth-based electricity company declined to say exactly how much
gas it would buy, but industry sources said it had contracted to take
200 billion cubic feet of gas from Erskine, which is expected to produce
about 330 billion cubic feet of gas and 75 million barrels of condensate
over a 12-year lifetime.
BP and Texaco each own 50% of the North Sea field, which will cost
about #290m to develop.
Hydro-Electric, the smaller of Scotland's two power distributors,
generates about half its electricity from gas.

New Delhi, Friday
THE widow of Rajiv Gandhi, Italian-born Sonia, was today urged to join
thousands of rebels who have staged an revolt against Indian Prime
Minister P V Narasimha Rao's ruling Congress party.
Today they held a rally to demand that the leader step down to stave
off defeat in general elections next year.
Speakers at the rally urged Sonia, the inheritor of the Nehru-Gandhi
dynasty's mantle, to cast her lot with them. However, although she has
invited members from both factions of the party to her home this week,
she did not attend today's gathering and has kept silent on the
in-fighting.
Today's rally came two days before the fourth anniversary of the
assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, killed by a suicide bomber during an
electoral campaign. Dissidents accuse Rao of bungling a probe into his
murder.
About 30,000 party members from all over India gathered peacefully in
the searing heat of the capital today in a rally which capped months of
sniping at Rao and his four-year-old government, effectively splitting
India's ruling party.
Prominent dissident Narain Dutt Tiwari was chosen as the leader of the
rebels, who seek to drive Rao from the party leadership and return
Congress to its roots.--Reuter.

Cannes, Friday
IT DOESN'T seem like it from the cheery chit-chat and plastic smiles
at the Cannes Film Festival, but the cinematic world is locked in
all-out war.
As the venue of the biggest film jamboree, the French Riviera resort
provides a barometer of the clash over Hollywood's domination of
Europe's film industry.
Executives from both camps sift the gossip and events in minute detail
for clues to who is winning.
French jury president Jeanne Moreau took a swipe at what many
Europeans see as an invasion by low-brow American culture, saying that
television situation comedies and other attempts at ''shrinking life''
could jeopardise the industry as a whole.
''Believe me, there's a war on. People have to understand that films
must be made with audiences in mind,'' said one US producer with several
films in competition at Cannes, firing his own salvo at European film
makers.
''The French for one fail to see movies as a business like any
other,'' he added.
This year's Cannes line-up reflects American success and the disarray
of its closest competitor, the French cinema, long past its golden age
of the 1960s and 1970s.
There are six US films in competition for the Golden Palm award, many
of them the work of flourishing independents such as Miramax, which won
last year's palm with Pulp Fiction, rather than the big studios.
France, self-appointed leader of the European offensive against
Hollywood, has only three entries for the Palm and is reduced to
co-producing many films outside the competition.
That it can fund other countries' output is due more to its generous
state subsidies than to large box-office returns.
The Unifrance agency, in charge of promoting French films abroad, is
fighting an uphill battle to find a distributor prepared to handle
French films dubbed into English for the American market in particular.
At the European Union headquarters in Brussels, France is pushing a
plan to force EU television channels to devote 51% of screen time to
European productions.
The United States, defeated last year when Paris managed to exclude
films from a world trade pact, is waging a campaign against such quotas
and many EU members have opposed the plan.
''Quotas have to be the first line of battle but they are not enough
against a monolithic machine like Hollywood,'' said Marin Karmitz, head
of independent French producer MK2 which counts Polish Krzystof
Kieslowsky among its directors.
''So far France is playing out its historic vocation as the home of
resistance. It's involved in co-productions without which part of world
cinema could not exist,'' he said.
Executives at the festival are looking to France's new Culture
Minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, to rally European Union partners before
its rotating turn as EU president finishes at the end of June with a
summit in Cannes.
New conservative French President Jacques Chirac has made no
commitment on audiovisual policy apart from promising to fight hard for
quotas and advocating a bigger Culture Ministry budget.--Reuter.

Tokyo, Friday
DOOMSDAY guru Shoko Asahara, suspected of masterminding the Tokyo
nerve gas attack, struggled today to find a lawyer to defend him in
Japan's trial of the century.
Asahara's efforts to find a high-profile criminal lawyer to represent
him have so far failed and most legal experts expect the court to have
to appoint a lawyer for his defence.
''This is nothing like the O J Simpson case. Every lawyer in town is
running for cover,'' one legal expert said.
Police sources quoted Asahara as saying he planned to plead not guilty
if charges are brought against him for the March 20 subway attack, which
killed 12 people and injured more than 5000.
They said Asahara has so far stonewalled all questions by simply
saying: ''I am keeping silent about the truth. I will tell everything in
court.''
Officials agreed to initiate legal moves promptly to disband the Aum
Shinri Kyo cult if Asahara is indicted for the subway attack. Police say
the cult's science chief has admitted producing 1.3 gallons of sarin,
the nerve gas used in the attack.--Reuter.

THE ideological torment of the modern Conservative Party is the
culmination of the collision course on which the party has historically
teetered. Finally stricken, bewildered, and ironised to its back teeth,
it gawks forlornly as its strange, eventful history of religiosity and
rapacity accelerates towards its fateful conclusion.
It is a political cliche that the Conservative Party is an odd
alliance. And, like many cliches, it is true. The party is a
portmanteau, containing antithetical agendas. A cross-compartmental
modus vivendi is an Establishment necessity. Now, the historical
gentlemen's agreement is sundering under the pressure of processes in
which the Establishment has haplessly colluded.
On one side is High Toryism. This has no essential connection with any
economic programme. It is a cultural vision, constituted by a set of
discourses and forms, and totalised in historical apologists such as
Larkin, St John Stevas, Ted Heath, John Biffen, and the modern
philosopher Roger Scruton. It proposes an England which is, as T S Eliot
proclaimed himself, Anglo-Catholic in religion, royalist in politics,
and classicist in literature.
Its predilections are hierarchy, deference, God, history, the high
arts, freedom, gentility, and English exceptionalism, expressed in the
ideological totems of church, country, monarchy, Empire, the
(patriarchal) family, and autonomous individuals choosing freely on
weekdays and removing cycle-clips in awkward reverence on Sundays. It is
this predisposition which makes the Conservative Party conservative; it
is this history which Ted Heath periodically and plaintively invoked, in
many an eighties Newsnight interview, as he pleaded, ''We are
Conserv-atives.''
On the other side is the lurking nemesis of laissez-faire, capitalist
economics. As Marx and Brecht both realised, capitalism is radical,
inasmuch as the commodity is indifferent to sacred spaces and to
hierarchical divisions of class, sex, and race. The commodity blithely
transgresses the frontiers between high and low, and is therefore
subversive of those forms and discourses essential to the hegemony of
British capitalism's historical beneficiaries.
There is, therefore, nothing Conservative about capitalism. The
unmediated market cannot preserve hegemony, whether social, cultural,
political, or economic. If Establishment ascendancy is to be protected,
then a set of extraneous, legitimating ideological forms is required to
circumscribe an otherwise anarchic force.
Pre-Thatcherism, the Conservative Party performed the high-wire act
with admirable adroitness. The market was allowed out to play in the
touching belief that it was free as a bird, while hands were kept firmly
and watchfully on the restraining ideological levers of the
Establishment. So long as capitalism wasn't egged on too much, then the
formative efficiency of God, England, and the Gentility Principle could
be harnessed to prevent the market from becoming too rudely market-like.
An easy trick, really: a green and pleasant land of putatively
self-governing individuals, whose actual choices and self-conception are
confined by an ideological apparatus which has its own pleasurable
internalisation as part of its very logic. Everybody happy, and nothing
changed.
In Thatcherism, however, the capitalist genie was let out of the
bottle. Thatcherism is often summarily and contemptuously identified,
especially in Scotland, with ''Victorian values''. But careful
distinctions are required. As a set of economic directives, involving
thrift, prudent housekeeping, free trade, and imperialist
presumptuousness, then reputedly Victorian attitudes doubtless inform
the Thatcher agenda. It is micro-level wit and good sense which she
minded when she purred that the Scots ''invented'' Thatcherism. She was
not crediting the Scots with the invention of High Toryism.
And it is indiscriminate to glissade, as some do, from the former,
pecuniary programme to the latter, cultural vision, to which Thatcherism
is essentially inimical. In Thatcherism, capitalism was egged on, egged
on again, and dared towards its logical, iconoclastic conclusion. The
ramifications -- economic, social, cultural, and political -- have been
diffuse and profound.
One consequence was shock and indignation in the ranks of the Old Boy
fraternity, for whom capitalism and their own ideology was a swaggering
and inviolable double act. Consummate in their oblivion to the fact that
their own incomparable advantages, as Lawrence put it, required that
theology which capitalism could live without, their noses were pushed up
against a liberated, upstart capital which had outgrown the
authenticating and domesticating Establishment imprimatur.
The pique felt at British capital's solo career is paralleled in the
US, at the effrontery of a Japanese capitalism that proceeds swimmingly
without the supporting edifices of vigilante groups, apple-pie, church
raffles, and the other ideological unctuosities of its erstwhile
economic pedagogue.
The voguish belittlement of our national, ideologically definitive
institutions and practices is a natural consequence of the freefall path
of Thatcherite capitalism. Daredevil economics is not the sole source,
however, of the national disaffection. Another is the formation of the
post-war educated and socially aware working-class.
Though not instinctively insurgent, this class generally demands that
deference and oracular authority is merited . . . It is therefore
disposed to look vexedly at the Dianas, the Fergies, the jumped-up MPs,
the racketeering chairmen, the fat media moguls, the sexually ambiguous
clergymen, and demur: ''But who are these people?'' It indicts the
parliamentary left that Conservative George Walden's memorably
forthright question about ''well-born nonentities'' made him this
group's parliamentary spokesperson.
It is possible als
Establishment discredit was nectar to this insurgent class, who
received patrician gracelessness as the ideological rubber-stamp for
those irreverent energies unleased by Thatcherite economics. They could
legitmately flash their bums at their masters and, like a band of
Dickensian anti-heroes, spin #60,000 out of sixpence, mouthing facts not
fancies, sense not sentimentality.
Thatcher's parvenus did'nt stop at that. The most grim and haunting of
Conservative Party ironies was to burst forth from their bellies. The
only Establishment form which they upheld was love of country.
But the England of High Toryism, totalised and legitimated in images
of village greens, the royal family, Anglicanism, Westminster, and
benevolent global pedagogy, was ruthlessly unclothed by the recalcitrant
appetites of a rapacious, on-the-make capitalism. The meditative,
history imbibed patriotism of a St John Stevas was betrayed and
mortified by the muscular, virile nationalism of vulgar entryists who
preferred to rule the waves, chuck the empty lager cans overboard, and
stuff the high falutin' metaphysical claptrap.
In a denouement worthy of Golding or Freud, High Toryism was
harrowingly confronted with the phallus behind its solemn, legitimating
self-aestheticisation, by an uncouth fleet of phallus-brandishing
marauders.
The unedifying plot was portentiously enacted, in fact, within the
person of Mrs Thatcher. Those who witnessed the mellifluous St Francis
of Assisi recitation, in May 1979, were shown the shimmering High Tory
ego; there was scarce hint of the aggression with which the swelling
libidinal drives would brutalise the beguiling English Rose.
The Thatcher Experience was, in Julie Burchill's memorable analogy,
like an album with Vera Lynn on the cover and ''Never Mind the
Bollocks!'' inside. The packaging soon began to tear, and the Thatcher
id was finally propelled, in unbridled unloveliness, during the
Falklands war. At this pivotal point, Vera was exultantly discarded, the
lead role given to the Boys from Bethnal Green, and court jester
derogation offered to the Old Etonian and One Nationite inebriates.
In Thatcherism, the Establishment therefore cut the ground from under
its own feet, and the resultant kerfuffle is a tragicomic treasure. The
Conservative Party has back-pedalled frantically, towards cricket, warm
beer, spam fritters, and evensong -- culminating in the grotesquery of
Back to Basics and the gruesome irony of Thatcher's acolyte Michael
Portillo offering a flabby defence of the Establishment's legitimating
institutions. If you can't stand the heat, revitalise church, monarchy,
parliament, family, the proms, just wars, Blue Peter, period costumes,
and the autonomous subject . . . with fingers in the till.
The Conservative Party is now beginning to recognise, publicly, the
ideological double bind. Party thinkers and grandees are sometimes heard
on erudite radio programmes, toying with the allegedly new dilemma of
being ''both pro-nation and pro-business''. The usual suspects --
Europe, the global village, and the information superhighway -- are
rounded up. Even the bravest of us rarely has the courage, as Nietzsche
reflected, for what he really knows, and most of them finally know that
these villains of the peace are playing a supporting role in the
Conservative Party's predicament.
The problem of favouring both nation and business is, expunged of
Toryspeak, the problem of being for both Establishment and capitalism;
Europe, global villages, and information superhighways have precious
little to do with this conundrum, which predates all three and sprouts
horns with the Thatcherite propulsions of capitalism towards its
self-realisation.
This, particular, Conservative Party calamity had been waiting to
happen. With Thatcher, it finally did happen, and it is all coming home
to roost. The emergence of the ticklish Independent Conservatives is
symptomatic of party disorientation, and we expectantly await the
audacious spirit who will campaign on a ''Capitalist Conservative'' or
an ''Establishment Conservative'' ticket.
The political and cultural choice bequeathed by Thatcherism and its
counter-revolution is singularly unalluring. Auden predicted, in 1943,
that ''the Rough Diamond, the Conservative Whore, the bandit who is good
to his mother, the epileptic girl who has a way with animals will be the
heroes and heroines of the New Tragedy when the general, the statesman,
and the philosopher have become the butt of every farce and satire''.
The eighties and nineties have confirmed Auden's gloomy prognosis;
news is generally confused with populist entertainment, with serious
news regularly a solemnification of the tabloid agenda. It is desperate.
But what if the alternative is Basics, the Queen's Christmas message,
Trooping of the Colour, Doffing of the Cap, and the whole claptrap of
the Establishment ego? Six and half a dozen, is it not? Either way,
there seems little to choose between disease and cure. The radical
challenge is to supersede this depressing choice. It is a challenge
taken up by bodies such as Charter 88 and the Institute For Public
Policy Research, who realise that we can find the fortitude and
imagination to abjure the blank, boorish commodity imperialism of
Thatcherism, without surrendering into the waiting arms of the Albion we
once knew and loved.
The SNP's massively disappointing lack of bottle over the monarchy is,
in this respect, an outrage which richly deserves to lose them votes.
The party generally displays a commendable contempt for the ideology of
the British state; yet it surrenders, at the eleventh hour, to the most
contemptibly ostentatious, anachronistic, and unjust manifestation of
that ideology.
Visionaries of the left must again seize the moment, and mould the
political, social, and cultural climate. According to Stephen Spender, P
B Shelley is ''probably the greatest influence on the Labour movement''.
The claim is probably reckless; Shelley was a republican, for
instance, and republicanism gets conspicuously limited ventilation in
Labour history. But if the left can retrieve and affirm this source of
itself, then it can ensure that we never go back either to Thatcherism
or to Basics.
The salient group might well be the aforementioned educated
working-class; its activity, or inactivity, could be the most powerful
determinant of the kind of nation we become.

STERLING was sidelined for much of the day in the currency markets
with attention focused on the dollar/mark rate.
The pound had a weaker tone against a recovering mark. It lost almost
a pfennig to DM2.2678 but is thought to have solid support around
DM2.2600 with its upside capped at around DM2.2700 in the absence of
higher UK base rates.
The pound gained more than a cent against the dollar at $1.5738 but
its value against a range of major trading currencies eased by 0.2 to
84.9. UK non-EU trade figures are due to be published on Monday.
Elsewhere in the currency markets, the Belgian franc was slightly
weaker ahead of Sunday's general election which is expected to lead to
big gains for extremist right wing parties. The French franc remained
steady helped by recent denials of an ERM reshuffle.

''ANOTHER one bites the dust!'' we joked, grimly, as the groom sat
nervously in the front row of the improvised church. In contrast with
the high-spirited stag celebrations of a few weeks ago, it was time for
the more muted, respectful celebrations of Big Davie's Big Day. As
swansongs go, it was a fairly spectacular one; overlooking Loch Lomond,
we watched our mate embrace his bride and his one-way ticket to
Australia.
Having been to many weddings, the lads all seemed relaxed. I've
usually managed to resist the call to kilts, until now. With all the
Australians there, I think Big Dave wanted to stamp a bit of Scots
identity on the do.
Wearing kilts, like drinking wine, is something I do only for social
occasions, and my memories of wearing the kilt are not the most
pleasant. The first time I wore one was when I spoke at a student union
Burns Supper. At a late stage of the night, to celebrate my speech, I
was handed a half pint of Glenfiddich to a huge cheer of acclaim. Being
19, drunk, stupid, and more significantly, a student, I polished it off.
Of course, I know that this was a stupid thing to do, I knew it even
then, but you have only to watch teenagers driving to see that there's a
big difference between knowing something is reckless, and caring about
it. Drinking large amounts of spirits in one go is exactly the kind of
stunt that turns a stag night into a serious item at the end of News at
Ten. I was fortunate enough to suffer only a four-day hangover, as
always there's a fine line between tragedy and anecdote.
The next time I wore one was at Wee Dave's wedding. It started badly:
either the shop had managed to measure me wrongly, or at some other
wedding there was a short, thin bloke saying ''I can't understand it, it
looked so good in the shop''. Anyway, other than being whistled at
outside the church by a van-load of workmen, the most embarrassing bit
was strolling into the Ladies' in full view of the whole reception. It
probably says something about my psyche, but I'm not sure I want to know
what.
While getting fitted this time, the man in the kilt shop confirmed my
suspicions that the kilt is back as a wedding fashion statement. Why
now? In the bland eighties and nineties, for the average western male,
there is no fashion as such, the only statement that can be made is that
of expense. In contrast, the kilt is an obvious statement of
nationality, pride, confidence and, er . . . tartan.
The English love a bit of mystery in the old ''what's worn under the
kilt?'' debate, and one of the great myths of our time must be that
women find the kilt attractive on a man. The feeling of being, as Wee
Dave so eloquently put it, ''al fresco in the downstairs department''
was more draughty than stirring. ''Yes,'' you say, ''but didn't the
women find it a turn on?'' No.
Even a kilt can't hide the fact that you're a fat middle-aged man with
a face like a car crash. Not unless you wrap it round your head, anyway.
A combination of ceilidh music and a few beers soon stopped me feeling
self-conscious about the lack of trouserly surrounds. My attitude to
country dancing is similar to that which I have towards cardiac
resuscitation: I feel proud that I can do it, but I've no desire to do
it continually when there's drinking to be done.
If it's true that country dancing is not taught widely in schools,
then I think that that's a shame. The basic dances are still ingrained
in my head, and there's no better way for a gawky adolescent male to
learn to interact with girlies than through country dancing. It's
difficult to say something too stupid when your partner is fighting back
tears of laughter. Bumbling attempts at conversation look almost
articulate compared to the unco-ordinated rubbish that constitutes your
body language.
Wearing the kilt, I felt I had to do a lot of dancing. I did them all:
the Gay Gordon, the Canadian Barn Dance, and that old favourite, Twirl
The Lassie Round Till She Feels Sick. I hardly stopped dancing all
night, mainly because it was difficult to plead ignorance when the band
were making up dances like Tasmanian Devils' Twirl and the Ayer's Rock
Waltz.
During their short break, the musicians confirmed that they were
busier than ever. Watching the party I could see why. Kilts or no,
ceilidh dancing is a brilliant way of keeping the party going. Everyone
can join in, and a particular bonus is that it obviates the need for a
DJ, who with all the sensitivity of a tabloid reporter will play records
like ''I want your lovin' all night'' for Aunt Brenda at her
seventieth-birthday party.
Suffice to say, it was a great night, probably the most fun I've had
in a kilt. The next morning I began to wonder if I have a form of tartan
allergy. Every time I wake up after wearing one, I have a sore head and
feel sick all day. Apparently I'm not alone, next day everyone else
seemed a bit iffy too.
A FEW months ago, the strangest letter arrived, inviting me to speak
at, seriously, the Larkhall Rotary Club. I realised that the only time
they have a John Paul in Larkhall it's an effigy for their mid-summer
bonfire celebrations and assumed it was a joke. It wasn't, and with some
apprehension I went to their regular meeting place on Wednesday night. I
needn't have worried, I didn't have to change my name to Jock, and they
gave me an extremely warm welcome. (Not the type requiring an asbestos
suit!) I hope that they enjoyed it as much as I did. They even laughed
at my jokes and, thankfully, told me some better ones.

Kinshasa, Friday
RISING prices and fear of shortages are making life hard for residents
of Zaire's capital Kinshasa after measures to keep out the Ebola virus
cut the flow of food to the city.
At Gambela market in Kinshasa's slum district of Matonge today,
traders said a blockade of south-western Bandundu province, where all
124 of Zaire's cases of Ebola infection have been reported, was pushing
up prices.
With the death toll reaching 89, however, Prime Minister Kengo wa
Dondo said authorities had no choice.
The virus, spread through contact with blood and bodily fluids, kills
up to nine out of 10 victims by inducing uncontrollable bleeding.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said today that 124 Ebola cases
had been identified and 89 people had died. Yesterday's toll was 79 dead
out of 114 cases.
The outbreak is so far confined to Bandundu province, which produces
up to half of the capital's food. Most cases are in the town of Kikwit,
some 300 miles from the capital.
Authorities in the capital have banned travel to and from the stricken
region. Tonight they eased the quarantine on Kikwit, but more than 3000
people, mostly traders, and about 250 trucks, many carrying food,
remained stranded on the road from Bandundu at Mongata, 90 miles from
Kinshasa, where they have been stuck for days.
Kengo, whose government is already grappling with the problem of more
than a million refugees from Rwanda, said the authorities had to choose
between keeping people alive and running the risk of them eating
infected food.
''It's already affecting our markets in Kinshasa, but between
shortages that may arise over the next few days and a disease which
kills inexorably, what choice is there?''
* Ebola virus was not found in a mother and her two children who
recently arrived in London from Zaire, the Department of Health
announced today. The three, who are having tests at north London
isolation hospital, are reportedly well.
In another development, the EU banned the import of monkeys from
Zaire. They are imported mainly into Britain, France, and Germany for
laboratory testing.--Reuter/AP.

THERE'S no kind way of saying this: Germaine Greer is raving. The
feminist guru of generations is not after all who we thought she was. So
who is she? She is kind to dogs. That much, at least, was clear from one
of her recent articles on the newly discovered joys of owning two
poodles. So when she is cross, as she so often is, she could not
possibly kick her pups. Instead she chooses to direct her splenetic ire
at something equally close to home, her younger feminist sister, Suzanne
Moore.
''Hair bird's nested all over the place, **** me shoes, and three fat
inches of cleavage . . . So much lipstick must rot the brain,'' she
drooled acidly.
It is a transfixing spectacle. The Grande Dame of Feminism duffing up
a latter-day guru, fellow Guardian columnist, populist writer, among
whose more memorable quotes is her assertion that we wanted men to be
sensitive and we got men with sensitive skin.
The spat exposes more than a generational conflict of ideology. It
may, sadly, show Greer to have been all along no more than a sheep in
wolves' clothing. You can read the debacle as dark comedy, hilarious
tragedy, or simply as a pantomime production by the woman who has cast
herself in the role of Pantaloon giving a pathetic performance which has
the lads guffawing and rolling in the aisles, reinforcing all the nasty
prejudices about she-bitches and the mud-wrestling sisterhood. Or as
evidence of the finale to the carefully constructed show that is the
life and works of Greer.
The squall was supposed to be about whether Moore did or didn't say
something to a newspaper diarist about whether Greer did or didn't have
a hysterectomy. So what? You have to remember that Greer's central
thesis for decades has been that such forms of medical treatment are
akin to surgical castration.
That she chose to attack on the unhallowed grounds of appearance is
dispiriting but possibly forgivable. But she went on to demolish the
notion that her gender politics are all-inclusive.
Moore was a ''pouting pundit'' who couldn't speak proper or write well
without disclosing her working-class roots. In short, Moore's feminist
arguments were unworthy because of how she looked and spoke and because
these disclosed her background. There's the rub. Class, after all in
Greer's book, matters more than gender.
We and Moore, a late entrant to university, single mother of two small
children, who might have seen herself as the inheritor of Greer's
feminism, find that class politics transcend gender politics after all.
For those who have twisted along the ideological by-ways and
cul-de-sacs -- even complete reverse turns -- of Greer's writings, from
The Female Eunuch's celebration of female independence and sexuality,
through Sex and Destiny, which praised chastity and the Islamic veil, to
a return to a feminist vision with ageing and the menopause in The
Change, this is probably the journey's terminus, where we get off and
admit we missed the right stop.
Maybe we can demystify her by showing her as the mere transcriber of
her own life in work. But that is too trite. Her solipsism was excusable
on the grounds that she offered a sharp, often fresh, perspective on
issues too often debated as if they are ethical gymnastics.
That she has cultivated the art of the hard-sell of self does not
destroy the worth of her insights. The personal is, in her case, the
political.
You could dismiss her spite as another example of that long, tedious
tradition of women all too willing to collude in the rubbishing of their
own sex for personal career advancement. But I wouldn't bother. It's
much more and less than that.
The psychology of Greer which says: ''I must rise and others must be
kicked in the face'' is far more likely to abort its mission of success
at all costs because its whole requirement is to make enemies.
A great key to the psychology of an individual is not what they
believe to be happening but the gross, overt effects of their actions,
both for themselves, and for those around them. Greer may think she is a
fighter for women and feminism. But if, as it turns out, she destroys
aspects of its credibility by her actions, one has the right to suspect
that she had, deep down, an utter contempt for it. That her strategies
were fuelled by the thrill of personal success and that the failure of
its values would not somehow be real to her.
Greer accused Moore, who smokes, of harbouring self-destruction.
Ironic that, when we can watch her self-destruct with the deft touch of
a spiteful pen.
Still, at least she's kind to dogs.

Scottish Television's glamour budget has reached its limit with the
appointment of The Herald's Keith Bruce as a presenter. ALLAN LAING
looks closely at his life and times.
IT is to be hoped (and expected) that the arts editor of The Herald,
Keith Bruce, will make a better television presenter than he does a
saxophone player. The chap, who this week takes over as host of Scottish
Television's flagship arts programme, Don't Look Down, blows wind in his
spare time for a Glasgow pop group called The Beat Poets. Sometimes he
even plays in tune.
Bruce started out as a sub-editor on the Sunday Post. Indeed, he was
for a while the officer-in-charge of the escape committee at Stalag D C
Thompson, guiding many a young journo towards the tunnel marked National
Union of Journalists.
Since arriving here eight years ago, he has been a news reporter, an
arts critic, and, on occasions, a book reviewer. His new role before the
cameras is perhaps an indication that Scottish Television's glamour
budget has, for the moment at least, reached its absolute limit. So is
Keith overawed at the prospect of being dubbed ''the new Janice
Forsyth''?
Wisely, he treats this spurious question with the contempt it so
justly deserves, choosing only to say that he is ''very pleased'' to
take over from Ms Forsyth who had ''put the show on the map''(and,
having done so, is off to concentrate upon her own independent
production company).
He remarks upon his tube task: ''The usual difficulty with appearing
on the television when you are a newspaper journalist is that all of a
sudden the boot is on the other foot and it is you who is being asked
the questions. On Don't Look Down at least I'll be on the side of the
fence as I'm used to.''
Bruce, or Keith as he is affectionately known in this office, is
honest enough to admit that Scottish arts coverage on television could
be a great deal better than it actually is.
''The fact that Don't Look Down is the only programme produced in
Scotland that is regularly giving fuller coverage to arts issues is a
disgrace -- not to mention its status as the only Scottish show with a
regular live music segment.
''It has an important job to do and I like to hope that from our
rooftop set we'll be offering an objective aerial view across the
artforms,''he adds.
Ken Neill, producer of the series, approached Keith with the idea
after the journalist had been a guest on the show a couple of times.
''He showed himself to be confident in the conversation pieces he took
part in. he had done all that we'd asked of him and given good food for
thought. He has a wide knowledge of the arts in Scotland. People have a
great respect for his opinion and I think he'll be great,'' he says.
Bruce's first 30 minutes of fame starts tomorrow when the first show
in the five-week-long series features a piece about writer William
Boyd's new collection of short stories, a studio discussion about
Mayfest, and live music from the Inverness-based band, 18 Wheeler. Ken
Neill has been well warned not to allow Bruceto play the saxophone.
Keith Bruce is 37.

Stephen McGinty finds that NB's new frontwoman is smart, sassy and has
a wit to watch.
LIKE Martin Luther King, NB's new presenter Sally Gray had a dream.
But while the good reverend spent his slumber promoting racial harmony,
Sally spent hers in the hair salon slagging Jodie Foster's performance
in Nell. ''It's s****, don't go near it,'' the fantasy coiffure heard,
and so did Ms Foster, no doubt in for some fringe work.
''When I realised I was sitting beside her I just said: 'c'mon, admit
it was crap' and Jodie agreed! I remember being delighted because I'd
got Jodie to say that she hadn't uttered a decent word throughout the
whole film . . . and then I woke up.'' To find, instead of being Jodie
Foster's drama coach, she presented Channel 4's MovieWatch!
Films and sleep are perfect pillow partners for the 26-year-old who
can't say no to work. Both Quiz Show and Pulp Fiction dissolved into
dreams as she was too exhausted to keep her eyes open. Born in Edinburgh
and cursed with a Calvinist work ethic, she is currently juggling five
shows: NB, Mister Barker, I'll Never Work, Disney Adventures, and a new
BBC Holiday show.
But now Sally's wide awake and reached lunchtime at Edinburgh's
Patissiere Florentine. She's looking good on what she insists is a bad
hair day, in silver Warehouse bomber jacket, big black boots and slinky
little dress, covered in a tight psychedelic t-shirt and jumper. She
should look good: on Moviewatch her clothing allowance ran to #100 a
week.
It's attracted celebrity admirers. Pierce Brosnan loved her PVC
leggings. ''He asked if it was hot in there. I said that's for me to
know and you not to find out.'' He still tried to kiss her neck. ''He
had spots, yeuk!'' Arnie asked if she worked out and what did she do
with her body. ''He said I looked great!'' So did Emma Thompson, while
Sean Bean was a gentleman. ''He kissed me goodbye.'' Ah!
Sally is sassy and has a wit to watch. After her audition for
Moviewatch she was told by the producers that they were torn between
herself and a model but decided not to go for looks, but personality.
Taken aback, she grabbed the job.
''It doesn't matter what you look like if you're a guy, but for a
women there is much more emphasis on how you look . . . If you're not
very good lookin' people say 'She's a dog . . . what's she doing on TV?'
But more and more I hope it's going to go to be judged on personality.''
Sally is saddled with both.
After attending St Margaret School in Edinburgh she completed her
degree in communications at Queen Margaret College by writing a
dissertation on children and television. ''My conclusions were that
children were more sophisticated viewers than people believed, and
should not be patronised.'' She entered the BBC as a
secretary/researcher and worked on, among other programmes, Question
Time.
She can reel off anecdotes about helping clear buildings during bomb
threats and getting stuck in lifts with half the Conservative Cabinet.
But her proudest achievement was harassing the producers to take the
show to Scotland. ''It was a nightmare. Andrew Neil and Tony Benn got
stuck at Heathrow and students were demonstrating outside the
building.''
Still television continues to hold a myriad of attractions. Being the
sole presenter of Scottish Television's NB should allow her to catch up
on the arts and attend this year's Edinburgh Festival -- a pleasure
denied her during a five-year stint in London.
''My job on NB is like a reporter rather than a presenter, but it's
good, it's different. As you know, the more people you interview the
better you get. It will be nice doing more serious subjects like arts,
compared to children's programmes where you're just wanting a basic
answer out of people. The action stuff will be great. I went go-karting
yesterday.''
Unfortunately it wasn't in a blood red Dodge Charger with white speed
line, as Sally's a serious Starsky and Hutch fan and action appeals to
her, in the same way that plate-glass windows did to The Professionals.
Yet her ambitions stretch up towards the citadel of light
entertainment and the de-throning of kings like Chris Evans, Noel
Edmonds and Michael Barrymore. ''It's time there was a woman up there.''
says Sally, who has a dream.
* NB is on STV on Mondays at 7pm.

THE reflections of the Bishop of Edinburgh on the temptations of the
flesh will have been well-received in, among other places, the fleshpots
of Westminster. They know all about these problems in the House of
Commons.
The spotlight has been on the incidence of marital misdemeanour among
MPs for a couple of years now, largely as a result of the spectacular
failure of the back-to-basics or, as it became known, the
back-to-my-place policy.
There is a strong recurring theme, which seems to be played out at
least every couple of months: a newspaper publishes a scandalous
allegation about the infidelities of some MP, of whom most people have
never heard; he confesses; appears before the jostling press on the
steps of his constituency association office with his bravely supportive
wife on his arm; the Prime Minister expresses his full support and
shortly afterwards the man resigns from whatever job it was that no-one
had noticed he was doing.
We have not got quite that far yet with the story-line developed in
the gripping first episode of The Politician's Wife, but . . .
The best evidence for that is provided by the former wife of one MP,
an abandoned victim in just such a case, who was strongly advised not to
watch the programme. A friend of hers, who had seen a preview, rang and
warned her not to tune in. It would hurt her. It would reopen the barely
healed scars. She would recognise too much and hear too many echoes of
her own circumstances. And she was right.
There has, of course, always been a spectacular rate for the break-up
of marriages among politicians, which must be considerably higher than
that for the rest of the population. The reasons are complex, but easily
explicable. In the first place, politicians are not really ordinary
people. They are more than a little, well, mad (or, to put it another
way, bonkers). This is not just a cheap joke: They have to be at least
slightly deranged in order to want to be an MP.
That is a very important point: MPs are self-selecting. They become
MPs as a result of a democratic election, but it was their original
decision to put themselves forward. Why? There are many reasons but
among them is a lust for power, an unusual interest in personal
promotion and a driving sense of ambition. This is true of any MP in any
party. There are one or two -- well, probably a couple of dozen --
spectacularly unimpressive examples: some people get elected by
accident, others as a result of Buggins Turn, like trade union placemen
who have done their time at union HQ and earned their seat, although
these are necessarily diminishing in number.
But the point is that by and large, MPs tend to be quite exceptional
people. This does not, of itself, explain why their marriages should be
more vulnerable, but it is part of the picture. These are people, men
and women, with a taste for excitement and risk, and it is perhaps
unsurprising that this should also sometimes lead them into sexual
adventure.
Throw them all together into the dramatically-charged atmosphere of
Westminster, where they are working extraordinary hours, possibly
hundreds of miles away from their homes for a large proportion of the
week; where they do not have to account for their movements and can
easily go missing for hours on end without anybody noticing; and where
they are mixing with a large number of like-minded people with whom they
may possibly have more in common than their domestic partners -- well,
is it really that surprising?
It has always been the case that politics and sex has made a powerful
cocktail. I think it was Gladstone who observed that he had known 13
Prime Ministers and 11 of them had been adulterers. The difference
today, however, even in comparison with just a few years ago is the
attention that the subject now gets from the press.
One of Westminster's best-known playboys was ruefully recalling to me
this week how different circumstances had been when he was first
elected. In those days MPs did not have to watch their behaviour in the
way that they certainly do now if they don't want to get caught napping,
away from home.
Watching The Politician's Wife, I felt a considerable twinge of shame
at the behaviour of the press towards the beleaguered family. My guilt
about the practices of my trade was compounded by the accurate portrayal
of the pack of press hounds the programme showed. They were offensive,
insensitive and intrusive, and it is not very difficult to imagine the
anguish that such an approach causes: in fact, I know from the
experiences of friends at Westminster who have been personally exposed
to how horrific it can be.
A couple of years ago a political friend of mine, a former minister,
had been cornered by the press and only escaped undetected by leaving
the premises in the boot of a car.
Years ago another friend, who lives in a London square in a house
backing on to a private communal garden, was somewhat surprised to see
the desperate face of the Foreign Secretary knocking on her kitchen
window and asking to be let in. Tony Crosland, for it was he, was holed
up by the press (over a row involving a silver coffee pot) in his home
which also backed on to the square. He made his getaway into her road.
But perhaps this series will provide a service which has been badly
needed for some time now and bring about a redress of sympathy for the
unsung heroine, the politician's wife. She deserves it, even if she is
not married to an unmitigated monster, even if her marriage is
blissfully contented.
Our political system demands a great deal of the partners of all
politicians, but it is usually the wives who are often vital in helping
their husbands get selected and elected in the first place, are
frequently solely responsible for keeping them there as the true experts
on local constituency politics and who get a very rough deal.

ONE of the biggest Hollywood casting games since the search for a
screen Scarlett that audiences would give a damn about, has started.
This time the search is for men. Seven of them.
More than 35 years after director John Sturges guided The Magnificent
Seven into action to Elmer Bernstein's stirring score, the American
version of what, in turn, had been the 1954 Shichini no Samurai (Seven
Samurai) is being remade. The director is Lawrence Kasdan -- The Big
Chill, Silverado, Costner's Wyatt Earp and Meg Ryan's present romantic,
successful fluff French Kiss -- whose brother Mark co-wrote the
screenplay update.
There were a couple of obvious questions to ask Kasdan this week. Why,
seemed the most pressing. . Surprisingly, he believes there is a young
audience out there that has not seen the original. But wasn't it all a
bit like remaking The Wild Bunch? How do you compete? He smiled
tolerantly. There were scenes and actions that could not be topped but
if you look closely -- and he's right -- there are slack sequences.
Kasdan has the rights to the Bernstein music. But where does he find
that movie buff trivia question cast? The original Seven were Yul
Brynner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughan --
and the two they miss -- Horst Buchholz and Brad Dexter.
We suggested to Kasdan that Brad Pitt would be perfect for the tall,
lean James Coburn role of the rider as fast with a throwing knife as a
gun. He didn't say yes, he didn't say no. Nor would he be drawn on
whether the leader would once again be bald -- it's hard to imagine even
Tom Cruise going that far for his art.
We'd bet on Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid -- Kasdan pals -- being in
there somewhere. Kasdan does agree that what the movie needs are men not
youngsters in the saddle. The script allows him one rookie. On the other
hand he's also got to fill the Eli Wallach role of the Mexican bandit
chief.
But a wistful, rather than betting, list to start with in order of
above appearance: Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia,
Michael Douglas, Gene Hackman, Mario Van Peebles.
Hey, they'll probably cast big Arnold in all seven roles. It would be
slightly cheaper.
* REMAKES and reworkings of old themes are now the flavour in
Hollywood. Jeff Bridges as Wild Bill Hickcok will be riding onto screens
soon. A movie based on Bridges' father Lloyd's Sea Hunt is in production
and Tom Arnold, the former Mr Roseanne Arnold, has been given the 10-4
to take over the role of the late Broderick Crawford's television series
Highway Patrol. Vincent Price's 1973 Theatre of Blood is in
pre-production but so far no ''new'' Price.
Liam ''Rob Roy'' Neeson is to be another Oscar Wilde and that lady
from the other side of the sheets, Moll Flanders, is to bound onscreen
again.
* MORE novel -- perhaps -- is the start of filming this week of
Dracula: Dead and Loving It. From the title you'll guess the source --
Mel Brooks is writer, director, producer and Professor Van Helsing.
Britain's Lysette Anthony is the snowy-necked damsel and in an inspired
casting coup, Leslie Nielson from Naked Gun fame is the count. It would
be good for Brooks to succeed -- it's 21 years since Young Frankenstein.
* MOVIE to watch for: Crimson Tide with Gene Hackman and Denzel
Washington on a nuclear submarine. Will they fire the missiles or not?
Britain's Tony Scott is the director and, yes, it's Top Gun underwater.
Denzel Washington insisted in conversation this week that he is not a
movie star. The evidence says otherwise, especially with another remake.
This time it is The Bishop's Wife, the 1947 romantic classic which
starred David Niven and Loretta Young who get some help from ''angel''
Cary Grant. This time Washington is the Good Samaritan who solves the
problems of Whitney Houston and Larry Fishburne who was Oscar nominated
for his portrayal of Ike Turner in What's Love Got To Do With It?
*
* THE American tabloid TV sensation shows are now losing ratings with
their continued obsession with the O J Simpson trial. Expensively
obtained footage of Simpson and his murdered wife Nicole's wedding
attracted only 9% of American viewers. Not that many months ago, the
entire nation would have been watching. Maybe it proves you can get too
much of a bad thing.

THE producer of Usual Suspects, (BBC Radio Scotland) Mike Lloyd, took
over from usual presenter Pat Kane this week to report from a radio and
television conference in Berlin. In this context where radio
refreshingly was valued equally with television, and not relegated to
the second division of ''backroom business'', the voices of European and
and American radio producers could be heard.
In France the producer of a feature could consider his/her role as
that of auteur, equal in artistic status to that of the film director.
Though one sensed the idea of producers becoming radio auteurs struck
Lloyd as being rather self-important (a bit too, well, French) it was
apparent that the place of the feature, demanding some concentration and
taking itself and its audience seriously, needed attention and
sustainment.
The feeling seemed to be that without a certain vigilance the feature
would become an endangered species. In the States where ''radio is
everywhere but saying nothing'' the hegemony of television and the
relegation of radio to being the distribution slave for news has meant
that the energies of producers are taken up with elbowing a space for
the programme to exist, before the actual creative work can even begin.
All the more reason then to be grateful for programmes of the quality
of Pretty Witty Nell (R3), Daniel Snowman's engaging portrait of Nell
Gwyn. When Charles II and his court were in exile the theatres of Spain
and France delighted them with actors of the female sex.
It wasn't just the straightforward sexiness of it, seeing actual women
instead of boys in frocks (which would have been a delight to some
anyway): the fact of real women playing real women, introduced on the
court's return, shifted the nature of current playwrighting. Women
performing led to women writing (Aphra Benn, Susan Centlivre) and to men
writing strong women's parts -- Dryden created characters especially for
Gwyn.
The novelty of gender realism allowed for deeper explorations of
sexual roles, and the delicious witty banter of the lascivious
heterosexual couple foreplaying their power games enthralled the
afternoon theatre audiences, who watched the flirtations of the aristos
with the thesps as avidly as the fictive onstage shenanigans. (Much more
fun, darling, than reading about Camilla in the Sun.)
Our dull Charles turns us all off monarchism but one's Restoration
sympathies are with troubadours against the puritans. Nell Gwyn,
obviously an intelligent and charismatic comic actor, was a free spirit
plainly untroubled by bogus notions of decency. Being what a present-day
Californian dude might call ''centred'' she had no wish for
respectability for herself, though her children were titled and ''in'',
she herself was content to be the hybrid jester at the court of her
royal lover's heart.
When her carriage was once mobbed by the crowd looking for one of
Charles's Catholic mistresses she declared happily, putting the crowd
right, that she was ''the Protestant whore''. As one contributor, Roger
Savage, put it, she was a mixture of Marie Lloyd and Edith Piaf: the
actress as star had come into being. Nell Gwyn's glorious impudence was
beautifully captured in a programme at once informative, funny, gossipy,
and clever.
And just as Teresa Gallagher's youthful throaty rendition of the
vibrant Nell brought a long-dead performer to imaginative life -- more
tellingly, in a strange way, than listening to, say, a scratchy
recording of Ellen Terry -- so Alan Cumming's Valentino (R2) delivered
the biographical goods. Written and directed by Bob Sinfield, this
dramatised life of the archetypal screen Latin lover, turbaned, exotic
and erotic, explored with a light and entertaining touch the space
between the sex-god image and the Italian immigrant boy with a need to
make good.
Sexually rejected by his first wife and patronised and abandoned by
his aesthetically snobbish second, the irony of the universally adored
but specifically unloved idol was neatly revealed without bathos.
Thousands came to gape at the dead 31-year-old in his open coffin:
famous for his sultry beauty, the object of female sexual fantasy in 20s
America, the gigolo turned obelisk. Poor Rudolfo -- maybe it wasn't the
banal burst appendix which killed him, maybe it was the concentrated
envy of redneck American males appalled by their women swooning for a
dago.

Middle England, it must be assumed, is falling about at one-joke
programmes which Scotland finds hard to tolerate, let alone raise a
smile at. Will Home Counties humour ever strike a chord?
A long time before television was invented, a pontificating old
English humorist, Parson Sydney Smith, was alleged to have remarked that
it would require a surgical operation to get a joke into a Scotsman's
head.
There was, and remains, no truth whatsoever in this remark, but it
must come as a comfort today to the producers of those middle-class,
middle-England, middle-aged sitcoms which are constantly inflicted upon
this great viewing nation of ours.
Actually, Sydney was mis-quoted. What he said, in fact, was that the
Scots were indeed an immensely amusing race, but that they needed a
little operating on to let the fun out. He knew of no instrument more
effectual for the purpose than a corkscrew. And perhaps he had a point.
Give us a few drinks and we'll laugh at just about anything. Except
perhaps those English sitcoms.
It's a funny old business humour. What makes us smile is demonstrably
a subjective matter. Some people think it's funny when they see an
upper-class twit in a tweed jacket struggling in vain to win Perth and
Kinross for the Tories. Other people (well, a few) just find that very
sad.
What passes for comedy on television usually -- though not always --
has to fall within the boundaries of good taste and moral acceptability.
After that, you pays your money and you takes your choice. There were
those who loved Monty Python and there were those who couldn't find a
laugh in the Parrot Sketch even if their very life depended on it.
But there are a handful of comedy programmes which, when considered in
the grand scheme of things, stand out as classics: sitcoms for the most
part, at which only those poor unfortunate souls with a humour lobotomy
would be unable to raise a chuckle.
Morecambe and Wise, Fawlty Towers, Cheers, One Foot In The Grave, Drop
The Dead Donkey, and Absolutely Fabulous. There you have them. A
handful. (So what about Bilko, The Likely Lads, Steptoe and Son,
Blackadder, and Hancock's Half Hour? -- Ed.) Oh, and of course there's
Bilko, The Likely Lads, Steptoe and Son, Blackadder, and Hancock's Half
Hour. Okay, two handfuls: universally funny programmes; timeless humour;
comedy which crosses national boundaries.
The acid test is the laugh-out-loud factor. It's something which we
don't do very often, laugh out loud. It's something which, in fact, we
don't do enough -- because it's good for us. So when the opportunity
arises, we cherish it.
Falling quite spectacularly outwith this classic status, however, is
the new series of Men Behaving Badly (BBC1, Monday) which is television
behaving badly. A vulgar one-joke show which is about as funny as an
orphanage burning down. Bloke TV at its worst.
It is a programme which proves the point about comedy being
subjective. To this writer at least, it's just not funny. The fact that
it's maybe not entirely right-on PC (two randy young men, one lusting
after a sexy blonde bird who doesn't fancy him, the other trying
desperately to avoid marriage to his long-suffering girlfriend) is
neither here nor there. I mean, some of the best programmes are
gloriously un-PC. It's just that Men Behaving Badly is a hoary old
chestnut of a tired joke, featuring characters as unlikeable as they are
stereotypical. The Likely Lads gone septic.
But maybe it's just me. Or then again maybe it's just us Scots. There
is no denying that it is a very popular comedy series, regularly
attracting decent audience figures. But I'd like to see a national
breakdown of those figures to see just how funny we find it in Scotland.
It first appeared as a Thames Television production in the early
nineties and picked up a British Comedy Award for the Best ITV sitcom of
1992. But for some reason (good taste perhaps?) ITV dumped it and the
BBC picked it up.
It should also be pointed out -- maybe as a warning to Scottish
viewers -- that this week also sees the return of the despicably bad
sitcom, Surgical Spirit (ITV, Friday) which is to humour what a barium
enema is to personal comfort. The fact that this turgid show is
returning for its seventh series defies all logic.
Finally, another programme which, I suspect, is not tickling
Scotland's funny bone at the moment is Next Of Kin -- the new BBC1
sitcom starring Richard Gaunt and Penelope Keith, which started last
week. Not only is it a mediocre programme, but it also boasted a subject
matter (the death of a recently retired couple's son and daughter-in-law
in a car crash) which was tasteless in the extreme. Laugh? I nearly
turned the channel.
It is remarkable, is it not, how many English-made (and English-set)
sitcoms lose a bit in the translation when they're watched by a Scottish
audience. There are, I would argue, two sound reasons for this. The
first is the fact that we Scots have a quite different sense of humour
from the English. The second is that, no matter how hard we try, we
cannot truly identify with a comedy which is set, as so many of them
are, in the affluent Home Counties. They might just as well be set on
the Planet Zog.
Someone once observed that ''the actor who, for an hour, pretends not
to be able to keep his hat on, sends the Englishman into the seventh
heaven of delight. Such a performance may make the Scotsman smile . . .
but only out of pity''. It's like playing the Glasgow Empire -- a
legendary graveyard for English comics.
Our humour is rarely a joke. Rarer still is it contrived. It is more
often a comment on life; an amusing philosophy. And it is of a quality,
texture, and dialect which the English often find difficult to
understand. Ours is the laughter of identity rather than the laughter of
ridicule.
Ian Pattison, the Scottish scriptwriter who invented Rab C. Nesbitt
and who has recently completed work on the new Glasgow-based comedy
drama series, Bad Boys, knows a thing or three about what makes Scots
laugh. He makes a living from it, after all. He has also created a
character in Nesbitt which has, against the odds, knocked them dead in
England.
So he is surely as well-placed as anyone to recognise the difference
between an English joke and a Scottish joke. He points out that, when
Cheers was first shown on Channel 4 in the eighties, it had a higher
audience in Scotland than in any other part of the UK. We are, he says,
much more inclined towards the American tradition.
''We like the fast-from the side of the mouth-as many gags as possible
type of humour which you get in programmes like Cheers and Taxi. Comedy
is a tough thing to do and the sitcom is an intensely difficult area
because you have to tell a credible story in 30 minutes and still make
the bastards laugh,'' he says.
He points out that the new generation of comedy writer/performers are
moving away from the sitcom format towards more sketch-based shows.
''I don't know quite why that is, but it is very difficult to tell a
story. If you have a sketch show, you can run with a whimsical little
idea that's as long or as short as you want. You don't have to resolve
it; you don't have to bring in extra characters, and you don't have to
make it last 30 minutes.
''It takes tremendous intelligence to write a sitcom. John Cleese only
wrote 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers. He used to go through 18 rewrites
for every one of them. They offered him a king's ransom to write a third
series but he wouldn't do it, because it was too much for him,'' he
says.
So is there some evidence that the sitcom format is in danger of dying
out? Not according to Pattison.
''No. There'll always be room for them. At their best, they're just
very funny stories 30 minutes long; and the human imagination never
tires of stories. You can bet your life that someone will come along and
bring out a new Absolutely Fabulous, and all of a sudden you'll have
another classic on your hands,'' he says.
It would be nice to think that the next comedy classic will come from
the pen of a Scots writer. Who knows, maybe even from Pattison himself.
If you accept the premise that a lot of English humour does not travel
well in a northerly direction then it follows that we, in Scotland, are
in dire need of more home-grown comedy. So perhaps it's time for BBC
Scotland and Scottish Television to hit the humour button. The way
things are going we could handle a good joke.
* THIS week sees the launch of three major new dramas, a one-off
mini-series set in London in the sixties, a turn-of-the-century medical
drama, and a contemporary cop show. So there must be something in there
to suit everyone.
Based on the novel by Martina Cole, Dangerous Lady (ITV Tuesday) takes
us back to the days of Keeler and Profumo. Set in the backstreets of
Notting Hill and the nightclubs of Soho, it's a steamy family saga about
the Ryans, immigrant Irish Catholic gangsters not averse to the odd
knee-capping or razor slashing.
Despite the fact that Maura Ryan (Susan Lynch) has seven notorious
brothers, she's a good girl. She even falls in love with a high-minded
policeman. But when the copper discovers the truth about her family ties
he abandons her. Devastated, Maura joins the lads and soon proves that
she's mad, bad, and dangerous to know. Brutal.
* CHARLES Dickens meets Emergency Ward Ten in Bramwell (ITV, Monday).
Jemma Redgrave stars as Dr Eleanor Bramwell, recently qualified in
medicine in turn-of-the-century London and determined to become a
leading surgeon.
The medical establishment, men-to-a-man and led by the eminent and
egotistical surgeon Sir Herbert Hamilton (Robert Hardy), reckon that a
woman's place is in the home. Which is bad news for Bramwell as she
struggles to make her mark in the medical world. Faced with intolerance
and prejudice all around her, the bold doctor sets up a charity hospital
in the deprived East End. The scene is set for lashings of blood on the
operating table. On the medical menu for episode one are syphilis,
gangrene, severed toes and an ovariectomy. Clearly intended to fill the
Peak Practice void.
* THERE'S an intentional touch of the NYPD Blues about Out Of The Blue
(BBC1, Tuesday) which centres on the life and crimes of a tight-knit
inner-city CID department (it was shot in Sheffield). Black humour is
the gimmick here. The idea was to do a working class drama abour
ordinary police officers (in the tradition of Z Cars and Softly Softly).
Most of the storylines are pretty grim and dark, so writers Peter
Bowker and Bill Gallagher decided to inject some wit into the scripts.
It stars our own John Hannah (Four Weddings and a Taggart).
* A RARE treat for movie fans is provided this week with The Century
of Cinema -- A personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through American
Movies (C4, Sunday) a three-parter in which the acclaimed director,
well, takes a personal journey through American movies.
This documentary, a curtain raiser to a C4 celebration of 100 years of
moving pictures, concentrates on the often obscure work which has
influenced him over the years.

A DENTIST who was convicted
of fraud, yesterday failed to have his name restored to the register.
John Callaghan, 46, of Alexandria, Dumbarton, was struck off in
November 1991 after defrauding a Scottish health authority of #200,000
the General Dental Council heard.
Callaghan, who was registered at 114 West George Street, Glasgow, was
at one time the highest paid dentist in Scotland.
He was jailed for five years on May 10, 1991, after admitting two
charges of fraud.
These involved 2000 bogus claims to the Argyle and Clyde Health
Authority during 1986-87.
0 Callaghan's deceit first came to light when the health authority
questioned 29 of his claims.
''Seventeen of the patients could not be traced,'' said Mr Paul
Honigmann, representing the General Dental Council, adding: ''The health
board checked with another 127 of which 50 could be traced and 77 could
not.''
Police officers called to investigate discovered pages had been ripped
from the appointment book.
''In the period of 18 months he had been paid #386,000 by the health
board.
Callaghan was arrested in May, 1989.
It was then, said Mr Honigmann, he embarked on a second fraud, by
using non precious metals in his work but claiming the full price for
precious metal. Police searching the surgery and found a concealed wall
behind which were bags of paper and containers of of petrol and gas.
Mr Ralph Shipway, representing Callaghan, described him as a
''workaholic''. ''Why?'' asked Mr Shipway, ''did he suddenly begin to
commit professional suicide?''
The proceeds of his fraud were ploughed back into the business, added
Mr Shipway.
Callaghan was paroled in January last year.
''He has had plenty of time to reflect on his crass stupidity. His one
desire is to make amends.'' Callaghan, he said did not want to return to
sole practice but would like to work under supervision.

VIENNA: A British lorry driver ferrying food and medical aid to
refugees in Bosnia, including toys for children, was stuck on the border
between Austria and Hungary yesterday, held up by Hungarian red tape.
Mike Taylor, from Newport in Shropshire, is carrying 22 tons of
humanitarian aid donated mainly by schools. He said he had spent two
days at a border post at Hegyeshalom because Hungarian border guards
would not let him through on his 23rd trip driving aid to Bosnia.

IMAGINE if King Lear had simply pulled himself together and calmed
down a bit. Given a decent suit, a photo-opportunity with the girls, and
a speech-writer who could explain that rambling on the moors showed real
concern for the environment, another term in office would have been well
within his grasp. The Fool might have remained a minister, and vice
versa, but that would have come as no surprise to anyone.
David Hare's Absence of War (BBC2, Thursday) depicted a Labour leader
being separated from his integrity the way most people are separated
from their livers. John Thaw played a natural orator, ''the Oxford
English Dictionary on speed'', forbidden ever to say what he meant or
felt. When finally he exploded (a bravura rant from Thaw) it was like a
steam valve being blown -- the hot air escaped in quantities, the heat
was real, but not a dent was made on the furniture.
It is a mark either of Neil Kinnock's honesty or his terminal naivety
that he allowed Hare full access to the Labour campaign when the
playwright was researching this piece (first staged at the ''Royal''
National Theatre). What the writer was after, and what Richard Eyre's
direction conveyed, was what Tories might call a triple whammy: a leader
who has lost confidence in himself, a party that has lost confidence in
its leader, and a political movement that has discarded self-belief.
As politics, the play involved an engaging paradox: for an
hour-and-a-half people talked of all the things they couldn't talk
about. Thaw's leader wanted to ''shut down the fantasy factory'', to
force Labour to be honest with itself. But the truth he wanted the party
to face was that it could no longer speak the truth. Honest politics
meant sensible, moderate dishonesty.
Though a touch theatrical -- and what's wrong with that? -- Absence of
War was a play forbidden any surprises. We knew the ending from the
start, knew equally that the modern generation of Labour politicians
learned nothing from Kinnock's misery save that he talked too much.
Thaw's valediction spoke best to the modern, squeaky-clean party. Why
don't we all just join the Tories? he asked at the end, if only to screw
them up too.
This was farce played as tragedy, full of echoes and prophecies.
Contrast it, if you can be bothered (and this critic cannot) with The
Politician's Wife (Channel 4, Tuesday), a piece both obvious and
opportunistic, politics as seen through the eyes of the News of the
World, and an example, in itself, of the moral vacuum it purported to
examine. If Absence of War was something less than Shakespearean, this
deeply foolish series wouldn't even give Jeffrey Archer a run for his
pile of money. Avoid at all costs, not least if you harbour any
affection for Juliet Stevenson, who deserves better.
As, in their way, do the McGann brothers. Since they had a hand in
getting The Hanging Gale (BBC1, Sunday) off the ground, however, it's
no-one's fault but their own if they're up to their necks, dramatically
speaking, in a Donegal bog. As a tale of spuds and blood this was one
looks, feels, and sounds very like a dud.
Plainly, there is no way to make light work of Ireland's Great Hunger.
Equally, it may be that there is no simple way to make dramatic sense of
tragedy on such a colossal scale. Nevertheless, it's safe to say that a
script fresh from the Catherine Cookson School of Breast-beating isn't
going to do the trick.
Michael Kitchen is good as the decent land agent, but Michael Kitchen
generally is. Joe, Paul, Mark and Stephen McGann can each do Darkly
Handsome at the drop of a clapperboard. But the overwhelming sense of
massed cliches sweeping in like a rain cloud off the ocean will do for
The Hanging Gale's ambitions long before this reviewer has his chance.
As is so often the case when TV tackles history, history is the last
thing anyone seems to have cared about.
Ric Burns is, meanwhile, a film-maker fascinated with the stuff. His
last series, on the American Civil War, was a revelation. The Wild West
(Channel 4, Sunday and Monday), his latest exploration of the dark
truths behind the bright myths of the United States, is equally simple,
equally moving, equally enthralling.
With only photographs, paintings and literature to help -- in TV terms
the equivalent of painting the Mona Lisa with a toothbrush -- Burns
animates the dead. Though the destruction of the native Americans is a
tale often told, this documentary gives it a real dramatic structure
without ever once tampering with the facts. Here, as in the Civil War
series, young America speaks for itself, in all its limitless variety,
and anyone who ever wondered why Vietnam ever happened will come away
just a little wiser.
NONE the wiser, as usual, were the embittered popsters featured in The
Music Biz (BBC2, Monday). This was another old story, telling of pretty
young things debauched and robbed by ruthless old men, but for once the
aspiring stars bleating of their inability to remember to read their
contracts didn't have it all their own way.
Granted, there are wheels within the wheels on which these butterflies
are broken. Granted, too, many music industry deals represent
institutionalised, albeit luxurious, slavery. But when a successful
young man like Jamiroquai is seen whining about contractual terms he
can't even pronounce, you begin to wonder who is doing the kidding.
After all, no-one has yet forced a spotty youth on stage at gun-point
and instructed him to do a Stevie Wonder impersonation or risk being
paid large sums of money. Granted, George Michael was once robbed blind.
Now, however, he gives away fortunes to lawyers rather than allow Sony
to keep him in designer suits and stubble. It is, you can't help but
feel, a funnier world than most.
Not as funny, though, as the near-universal welcome given to the
return of Fawlty Towers (BBC1, Sunday) would have you believe. This was
predictable, risible, English middle-class farce first time around, and
it remains so at third (or is it fourth?) sight.
Comic genius? Go on, beat the car to death, drop your trousers, do the
funny walk, don't mention the war, tremble at the wife, clout the dago .
. . And it's the Germans, of course, who have no sense of humour.

JOHN Macleod's article on Oxford (Weekender, April 29) owes more to
media portayal of Oxford as a city where subfusc students sit around
sipping sherry and a fresh corpse is turned up every week only for the
mystery to be unravelled in the last five minutes than the rather more
mundane realities of life. Popular consciousness may forever link the
city with the fictional worlds of Brideshead Revisited and Morse, but
Macleod's journalism presents Brideshead myth as established fact.
Oxford students are, actually, quite normal, really. The juxtaposition
at ''Oxford'' students with ''normal'' may not sell newspapers nor can
it be easily reconciled iwth the perception of the university as the
ultimate bastion of upper-class student life.
Every year, hundreds of intelligent Scots, fresh from the triumph of
their Highers, do not apply to Oxford, often as a result of fears that
they will not conform in a place where, is is believed, dressing for
dinner is the norm. Thus the Scots continue to be under-represented at
Oxford, but only because not enough of us apply, perpetuating the myth
of social exclusivity.
In addition, if Mr Macleod could tell me where in Oxford I could find
the ''meals beyond description'' he enjoyed, or, more important, pass on
some tips as how to get a drink in the King's Arms, I would be delighted
to know.

THE hammering of Kenneth Clarke for not raising interest rates at the
behest of Eddie George is a matter which must be seen in its proper
perspective.
We have it on the authority of the peerless Abraham Lincoln that
control of money is ''the supreme prerogative of Government'', and any
departure from that principle must be viewed in the light of our
democratic beliefs which are based upon the granting of power to
representatives of the people after free and fair election by the
people.
The relative independence of the Bundesbank is often quoted as an
example to be followed, and most of our economic analysts seem to have a
mindset in that groove. But after the Kaiser and Adolf Hitler, what has
Germany to teach us about preservation of democratic freedoms?
I regard Kenneth Clarke as a man of little substance but I would
advise against his office ever being denied the implementation of
Lincoln's ''supreme prerogative''. Give bankers the control of money and
you give them an illegitimate control over people's lives.
The thinkers among us know that far too many of our democratic
prerogatives have already been eroded. Let us guard what is left against
that free market dogma which would leave vital areas of decision-making
in the hands of financiers who are not answerable for the commonweal or
the needs and aspirations of our nation.

IT is encouraging to note that Alex Salmond is quite indefatigable in
his pursuit of Tony Blair in search of an explanation of the latter's
position on the question of Scottish self-determination (May 17).
Mr Blair's failure to reply to three written requests for
clarification is quite unacceptable behaviour in a political leader.
Can I remind Mr Salmond, and your readers, that my attempts to have Mr
Salmond clarify his own position on Scottish self-determination number
far more than three?
Since he wrote in The Herald (November 6, 1992) that he considered the
transfer of power from national parliaments to EU institutions
represented a ''desirable objective'', I have lost count of the number
of times I have asked him to explain why. He has yet to reply.
I have also made repeated requests to Mr Salmond to explain his
support for EMU ''under the right conditions''. He has yet to reply.
Given his desire for honesty on the part of political leaders will he
now say what conditions can ever make it right for people to hand over
control of their economy to a supranational organisation composed of
unelected bankers and bureaucrats outwith any democratic control, so
that from that time onwards the development of their own social and
economic welfare can never be a priority of the only institution with
the power and the authority to affect it?

AT the Scottish Conservative and Unionist conference John Major
indicated his willingness to listen in future.
While the portents are not good (Mr Tony Blair, for example, twice
weekly, is unsuccessful), will someone out there make our Prime Minister
see that a reduction in income tax will inevitably mean the widening of
the chasm between the ''haves'' and the ''have nots''?
Lower taxes will enrich the ''haves'' by presenting them with more
purchasing power. This will enhance their living standards, thus causing
the ''have nots'' to feel even more deprived.
Moreover, it would inevitably exacerbate crime, already unable to be
contained.
To talk of tax cuts when the NHS, education, and the infrastructure
especially are crying out for help is shameful and can only be seen as a
desperate ploy to recover popularity. It is need, not greed, that should
determine the policy. Failure to respond will see the party's demise
come the General Election, and deservedly so.
Affluence is commendable, but squalor as exists in the UK is not
tolerable and indictment on our civilised society. Please someone do
exploit the Premier's promised listening ear, before it's too late.

WHAT an excellent paradox you have used to describe Michael Forsyth's
present policies; libertarian Thatcherism (May 15), an apparently
ludicrous statement (who in Scotland would equate Thatcher with
liberty?) which contains a possible truth.
Indeed it does. The self-will of Forsyth, Thatcher, and the selfish
few destroys the hopes, dreams and legitimate aspirations of the many.
Scotland has had enough of Forsyth's policies, immature and mature.

IN answer to D C Glancy's plaintive question as to who funds the
police operation to keep the Scottish Conservatives safe in Glasgow
Royal Concert Hall for the duration of their conference (May 12), I
should imagine it is the same people who will pay for the policing of
the Labour Party's conferences if Tony Blair ever becomes Prime
Minister.

I WAS interested to read the report on heroin (diamorphine) being used
for pain relief in labour (May 15). I was disappointed that Dr Lunan's
comments on its evaluation encompassed the opinions of health
professionals only.
I believe that evaluations of such procedures are incomplete and of
very limited value without the opinions of the women who are being given
the treatment.
Why was it being evaluated anyway? Does this imply that it was a trial
of some sort? It it was a trial, then any women taking part should have
it clearly explained to them that they are being offered a place in a
trial, and that they have a choice about whether or not to participate.
Information should be given antenatally, in writing, so that women can
make a considered decision as to whether they wish to take part in a
trial.
Dr Lunan appears convinced that women are given information on which
to base their choices about pain relief. I wish I could agree. Just as
in a trial, it is essential that women are given information
antenatally, giving a clear statement of the possible benefits and risks
attendant on the various forms of pain relief avaiable. Only then will
women be able to make informed choices.
Perhaps Dr Lunan has done research to back up his assertion that all
women are well-informed about pain relief. I certainly know women who
say they were not. The Health Education Board for Scotland's New
Pregnancy Book is available to mothers antenatally. It states that an
injection, usually pethidine, is available. Diamorphine is not
mentioned. It states that the baby's breathing can sometimes be
affected, but that ''the baby can be treated if this is a problem''.
One important point which no-one has mentioned is that even if the
baby's breathing is unaffected the baby will often be sleepy for some
time. This can have a disastrous effect on the establishment of
breastfeeding. Mothers often describe their baby as ''doped up''.
Breastfeeding counsellors in the Glasgow area have noticed for some
time that a high proportion of mothers who seek help with breastfeeding
can trace their difficulties back to a sleepy baby who was unable to
suckle well in the early days.
It is all too easy for these mothers to feel that breastfeeding is
difficult and that they are failures. Mothers need to know that their
babies might be sleepy and that establishing breastfeeding might be
difficult if they are given diamorphine. This is part of making an
informed choice.
I was alarmed at the defensive reaction shown in your report. I am
sure that your readers can think of other medications which have been
given to people, with assurances that they were evaluated, beneficial
and harmless.
Perhaps Dr Lunan considers the research linking use of diamorphine
with future addictive behaviour to be flawed. I am grateful for his
opinion, but I prefer to choose for myself.

THE vastly different views of the Macleods (John and Rory) on the
Argentina/Falklands issue were interesting, but somewhat spoiled for
this pedant by the one thing their articles had in common, their
reference to Los Disparados (May 16 and 18).
Who were they? Not surely Los Desperados (bandits) who governed
Argentina at the time of the Falklands invasion, most of whom are still
alive and well.
They meant, I think, Los Desaparicidos (missing, extinct), the
thousands apparently murdered for daring to criticise Galtieri's fascist
regime.
The word is worth learning if only for the sake of remembering them
and their fate.

WITH reference to Mr Millar's letter about pre-payments of fuel bills
to avoid VAT (May 15), I think it may be helpful to explain the legal
parameters within which ScottishPower must operate.
When the issue first arose two years ago, Customs and Excise advised
all electricity companies that pre-payment of electricity must be
treated, for VAT purposes, as being in respect of the supply to a
specific premise.
Accordingly, they were unable to accept that continued VAT zero-rating
could be transferred to a new address when a customer moves before the
prepayment has been exhausted. For this reason, we refunded the
outstanding credit balance when Mr Millar moved home.
I trust this letter will clarify the situation and that Mr Millar
understands we are bound to adhere to the rulings of Customs and Excise.

CANST thou draw Leviathan with an Hook?'' God asks Job, and rubs home
the enormity of many tasks which face human beings. Jane Hook might just
agree, that the plight of parents of children with special needs face
situations that bear comparison with the sufferings of Job. While
fulfilling the roles of wife, mother, and airline employee, she
campaigns on behalf of special-needs children and recently found time to
stand in the local elections for the council. This leviathan of activity
can never be enough to keep pace with the needs of an autistic child.
''The community would rather think that everything is being done for
these kids,'' she says. ''But the reality is that because they are taken
away to special schools by taxi and returned home they have no friends
around them. The family close the door at teatime and the outsider
imagines typical family life. But it's not like that. There's tantrums,
plates flying. The parents find that other children shout at them, so
they shut the door. But that means 24-hour care devolves on them and
they don't have any social life. The children have a need to integrate
into the community but the acceptance factor is very low. They have
nowhere to go.''
She acknowledges that one exception is Blawarthill church down the
road from her own middle-class area where all kinds of community group
have been welcomed with open arms. Its leviathan of a minister, Neil
Galbraith, now a slip of his former self after a diet course, is a
powerhouse of ideas and campaigns to get the church to the heart of the
community. ''It's easier to get special-needs kids accepted in an area
like this,'' he says. ''I don't know if it's that there is more
compassion or whether they're just used to more problems and they think
this is just another of the same thing.'' His church hosts three
special-needs groups -- the mentally handicapped, Gartnavel former
patients, and a Link group.
Between them they make a formidable pair and have joined forces on a
number of issues. The latest is the imminent closure of Kirkton School,
the special-needs facility in the area. Both agree that it is
unrealistic to expect it to keep going indefinitely with seven pupils at
present and five after the summer. But Jane Hook has managed to get
funding for a pilot project this summer which will run a recreation
facility for special-needs children with funding for three full-time
workers. For that she needs the school.
''You need an outdoor play area which is secure. You don't know these
kids. One scalable fence, one gap in the perimeter, and they're out
running about creating merry hell,'' Jane Hook explains.
The Blawarthill church complex is open to them but not suitable for
such an enterprise. There is heady talk of buying out Kirkton and
running it as a special-needs facility for the West of Scotland on a
community run basis. And if there is funding to be had, these two are
skilled with hook and line. Neil Galbraith does not shrink from casting
his line into the pool of money generated by the National Lottery,
despite disapproval by many of his Kirk colleagues (this week the
General Assembly will hear two reports critical of the Lottery).
What struck me as I listened to the two activists talking, was that
the move within our society towards community care and away from the
''nanny state'' has resulted in many situations which have yet to be
thought through. I'm not talking about the Government and other
statutory authorities. I mean the extent to which the voluntary sector
-- and in many cases that means a local church of whatever denomination
-- is integral to the success of the enterprise.
Community activists are not the most comfortable and clubbable of
people. They are often too busy for the social niceties. They are often
abrasive because they are exasperated at being treated like nuisances
when they know they are not.
They sometimes lack a sense of humour because their noses are stuck in
the unfunny side of life. Some fall victim to ego-trips: when no-one
gives them credit they start to take some for themselves and drink too
deeply. Others catch the disease of factionalism which can ruin many an
enterprise. But take them away and our kind of society would be in a
sorry mess.
Who would turn up at the public meetings to plan the latest by-pass,
or fight the school closure? Precious few, and the case would go by
default. I am not saying that community activists are right in every
cause they espouse, but without them, would the planners be so
sensitive, would the social work departments tune in to the needs of
communities so closely, would the police know where the trouble spots
were to be found? Then there is the positive and caring role which many
community groups fulfil. It is not glory work. The whole thing is a bit
of a bore to most people who are quite glad someone else does it.
I am honest enough to admit that and not think after half an hour of
listening to the problems of looking after special-needs children, I was
ready to run away and not think about it. Perhaps you are like me, you
have to be prodded to realise how difficult life is for some people, how
much of our civilised society is held together by care and concern
rather than cash and social security payouts. It is one reason why I
believe that the maintenance of the principle and practice of a national
church is important to our country. With secularisation gaining ground
and churches losing it, right now keeping that fish on the line looks as
mighty a task as catching leviathan with a fishhook.

I NEVER write to papers complaining about reviewers. I believe that
their present lot is punishment for a cushy billet in some previous
life.
However, I feel I have to take issue with David Belcher's scant and
mean-spirited review of the Mary-Chapin Carpenter concert (May 15).
Even his knee jerks in the direction of Firhill did not elevate his
hasty, glib, and superficial effort to anything near what actually
happened.
Had he paid attention, he would have heard a superb performance by
arguably the finest female singer/songwriter to emerge from the States
since the heady days of Carole King/Joni Mitchell.
He would have heard some of the best guitar playing and all-round
group playing heard in Glasgow for years (these guys are different
class).
He would have heard standing ovation after standing ovation as a
packed house called Miss Carpenter back for encore after encore (I
counted eight).
Sadly, I think it was another case of David Belcher being the wrong
man at the wrong concert.

AS Local Medical Committee representative for the two GPs defamed by
your article of May 18, I have been asked to reply and attempt to
redress the balance of a very unfair presentation.
As Alan McDermid, your medical correspondent, knows very well, these
doctors are bound by a duty of confidentiality not to disclose their
reasons for removing or not accepting Mr and Mrs Copland as patients.
Suffice to say that Mr Copland knows full well the reasons for his
removal from the doctor's list but he has chosen not to make the real
reason known to the press; to compound his defamation of these GPs he
relies on the undeniably distressing and complex medical problems
suffered by his wife.
Indeed Mr Copland has not discussed matters with the other GPs and
hospital doctors who have been unable to establish a satisfactory
doctor-patient relationship. Moreover the extent of his actions caused
distress to attached practice staff.
This is not a punitive act by the doctors concerned; it is a response
to the utter breakdown of the doctor-patient relationship which has
created this impasse.
In conclusion, I would ask your correspondent to consider partients'
responsibilities as well as patients' rights.
Despite the local MP's protestations to the contrary the number of
patients removed from doctors' lists and unable to establish a rapport
with a new doctor is minimal.
If Mr Martin wishes a public inquiry into the real reasons behind
their removal the doctors concerned would be happy to co-operate and
have the opportunity to state their case. The decision was not taken at
all lightly and involved the full practice team.
It is a strange situation indeed when a journalist implies that a
doctor should enter in to a contract to supply general medical services
to a person seven days a week, 365 days a year, and must continue to do
this in the face of wholly unacceptable behaviour.

IT is tempting to talk about the contest for the leadership of the
Transport and General Workers' Union exclusively in terms of national
politics and the prospects of the Labour Party. Nevertheless, the
temptation should be avoided. Just as many of those who will vote in the
General Election in around two years are unaware of any Government other
than a Conservative one, so they have no recollection, and therefore no
rancorous baggage, over the role that the unions played in the affairs
of the last Labour Government. To be sure, the Tories will do their
level best to resurrect the flavour of those times, but it could be an
over-egged and rather uninteresting pudding for many voters. The
possibilities of raising trade union ghosts and ghoulies to frighten the
electorate is thus reduced. None of this means that the TGWU contest is
devoid of national political implications, for quite the reverse is
true. It will provide significant pointers to the extent of influence
over the unions which Mr Blair enjoys and will also feed into employers'
perceptions of life with a Labour Government.
The contest itself is particularly interesting as the demarcation
lines are fluid. Both candidates, the incumbent Mr Morris and his
challenger Mr Dromey, have gathered support from both the left and right
of the union. Mr Morris has been nominated by many more branches than Mr
Dromey, but a count of the votes represented by these branches tends to
even things out a little. Mr Dromey is a supporter of new Labour, who
has in turn the tacit support of Mr Blair. Mr Morris is the candidate of
more traditional forces within the union and has opposed some Labour
reforms, notably the replacement of Clause 4. Even here there are
elements of confusion, for Mr Morris is believed to have been in favour
of changing Clause 4 but felt bound to oppose the modernisers because of
the requirement of the union's constitution to support the executive.
The membership of the union was not allowed to express its views on the
matter through a vote, and this is a powerful point in favour of Mr
Dromey who argued for it, and against the general secretary, who opposed
it.
A contest between two colleagues is always a difficult affair, and
particularly when conducted in public. The comment by a former TGWU
general secretary, Mr Ron Todd, that it was immoral for any officer to
use Conservative employment laws to challenge a colleague's position, is
so silly that it can effectively be forgotten. Nevertheless the contest,
which was relatively gentlemanly until recently, has now become
bad-tempered and abusive. Mr Dromey is the principal culprit for he has
used his closeness to the Labour leader to attack Mr Morris for
opposing, and thereby damaging, elements of new Labour policy. Again,
this centres largely on Clause 4 which everyone hoped had been dealt
with. In dragging it out again, and using it in an antagonistic manner
to belabour his general secretary, Mr Dromey runs the risk of causing
more trouble than it is worth. The same cannot be said over the issue of
the minimum wage, supported strongly by Mr Morris at around #4 an hour.
The Labour leader has managed to smother the problem of setting a rate
until power has been achieved. Probably he hoped to leave it there, but
Mr Dromey and Mr Morris must address it seriously, and without indulging
in meaningless mutual insults.

THE new French Cabinet is almost certainly too large with more than 40
Ministers, but its more important novel features include the 12 women
members and new Ministers with unusual titles and overlapping
responsibilities. In political terms the government represents a
compromise between the centre-right and the far-right elements in the
Conservative coalition which successfully returned President Chirac, but
first indications are that it leans quite obviously towards Europe, an
impression Mr Chirac reinforced himself both by the speed with which he
arranged a formal encounter with President Kohl in Strasbourg and his
endorsement of the existing French policy positions in relation to the
understanding with Germany, progress towards European integration, and
the maintenance of a strong franc on the international currency markets.
There are some Euro-sceptics in the government but they are not in the
top posts; and nearly all the members, including the Prime Minister, the
highly capable Mr Juppe, owe their positions to their loyalty to Mr
Chirac even before their personal capacities. Survivors from the
Balladur regime are very few and there some notable (and unexpected)
casualties such as Mr Phillipe Seguin.
This beginning surely shows the direction in which the President will
hope to move. It must seem that continuity more than change has been
emphasised in spite of the opaqueness of Mr Chirac's campaign
statements. Actually it is too early to guess how policy will progress
when there are some evident contradictions. For example the strong franc
policy entails interest rates higher than they might otherwise be and
helps explain the level of French unemployment -- 50% higher than that
prevailing here. Unemployment fell a little under Mr Balladur, but not
much, and social strains remain evident as might have been guessed from
the high vote awarded to the racist Mr Le Pen in the first ballot of the
presidential elections. These strains will not be helped if the promises
of reform in the health and welfare budgets mean their reductions. The
new government wants to wage war on unemployment, and hopes to achieve
this by reduced taxation, but that will not work quickly and Mr Juppe
may discover that he repeats Mr Balladur's experience of ebbing
popularity if the continuing obstinacy of mass unemployment is
demonstrated.
The Chirac presidency is still committed to implementing a single
currency before the end of the century, but not at the earliest target
date two years from now. Even the later date might be too soon for all
but a handful of states which might include only Germany, Holland, and
Austria for sure. The French position may simply not allow for it, and
no-one anywhere in the Union should be left unaware of the enormous
costs (even in the most simple things like printing the masses of new
banknotes required). Mr Chirac has, however, shown already that he is a
pragmatist, and however much he has emphasised the continuity of
France's policies since the Treaty of Rome, he has made provision for
ensuring that public opinion is not left behind, hence the talk of
another referendum and the insistence on the Gaullist ''Europe des
Patries'' (the old nation states) rather than the federalist dream with
its emphasis on the dominant role of Brussels. His position is really
more flexible than it might seem, and to that extent British
Conservatives, excepting only the confirmed Euro-sceptics, may find it
close to their own as was predicted; and it may even be somewhat closer
than was Mr Mitterrand's. The difference is not great, however, and it
looks as if the Chirac presidency confirms the old French adage about
the greater the change the more things remain the same. The personnel of
French political  life has changed but it is far too early to discern
much else.

The Royal College of Nursing says the industrial action they are
considering will not harm patients. Alan MacDermid asks if we should
take this with a pinch of salt.
ALL-OUT strike has never seriously been on the agenda since the
nurses' pay dispute began. The shots the RCN and Unison have in their
locker are aimed at making life awkward for the management rather than
the patients.
But can the two really be separated? Health Minister Gerald Malone
thinks not, as he made clear in the letter which so infuriated the RCN
Congress on Wednesday. Messing up the administration would eventually
work through to the sharp end, if only to the extension of waiting times
for treatment, he maintained.
As a candidate for Patients' Champion, Malone may have pretty shaky
credentials -- recent gems include:
* ''Fifty per cent of people who turn up at accident and emergency
departments are inappropriate attenders.''
* ''There are too many people occupying intensive-care beds who
shouldn't be there -- they have no real chance of recovery.''
Nevertheless, some things may be true even if Gerald Malone says so.
The reality of the NHS today is that if a nurse's services could be
dispensed with, they would have been long before now.
I asked Donald McNeill, chief executive at South Ayrshire Hospital
Trust, how he would cope if his 800 nurses started shunning paperwork,
stepping up orders for supplies, and sticking strictly to their
contracted hours. He readily acknowledged that the trust, based at Ayr
Hospital, ran very much on the goodwill of the nursing staff.
''There is no doubt that nurses go that extra mile for us,'' he said.
''In terms of their flexibility, over duty rosters and the like, they
co-operate very much, and I would be very disappointed to see that
disappear. What I fail to see is how it can be done without it being
detrimental to the interests of the patient.''
There was a lot of work to be done that helped the administration;
that was not in itself the priority but it was targeted towards the
smooth flow of patients through the hospital.
''I don't see how they can ring-fence these things from patient care.
Patients are moved through the hospital and essentially it is nurses
working the information system or the paperwork that allows that to
happen,'' said McNeill.
If a patient required physiotherapy, for example, the request had to
be made, whether a computer entry or a written form. If that wasn't
being done it would simply delay patients' access to a wide range of
treatments they might need.
Even in a so-called paper-free office, he pointed out, there remained
a statutory requirement for written records of patient care, for example
X-ray or laboratory tests, and for whatever drugs or other treatment
that had been given. These were used for research and clinical audit,
and if a trust were involved in litigation it wouldn't look too good if
their records weren't up to scratch.
''Our X-ray department can give results directly to the ward on a
computer system but it has to be followed up with a written report.
''Administration of drug therapy is part of a nurse's job -- it has to
be recorded so the next person coming on duty knows what has been given
and what has still to be given. I don't see how you can divorce the two
-- the unions recognise this as I do.
''I accept absolutely that delays harm the administration, but I can't
say there is no knock-on effect to patients.
''I am confident also that, as far as the local RCN and Unison people
are concerned, whatever industrial action is embarked on they will talk
to us and give us the opportunity to point this out. Our relationship
with them is very good.
''It might be argued that we should be rewarding their flexibility in
a financial sense, and I think that is what the debate on local pay is
about. You can't reward local flexibility in a national agreement.''
McNeill pointed out that a quarter of his nurses -- and half the 2000
total staff -- were already on local contracts. The trust is offering 3%
with strings, a package which will cost #900,000 all round, including
#360,000 for the nurses.
There is little that managements like Ayr's can do by way of
contingency planning for guerrilla industrial action -- a lot will hinge
on the undertaking McNeill has been given by the nurses to discuss their
plans with the management.
There was no doubt that working to contract would require McNeill and
his colleagues to review staffing levels. If that meant agency nurses,
it would be extremely costly, and there would be a cost to the patients
in loss of continuity of care.
More likely is increased dependence on bank nurses -- the reserve of
individual nurses who have formerly worked at the hospital, given up,
usually for family reasons, and are willing to come in on an ad-hoc
basis.
''We make a lot of effort to maintain the bank -- we have them in for
training to keep them up to date,'' he said.
''I accept we would have to incur expense -- it would cost the NHS a
lot of money. But it would still cost the patient in continuity of
care.''
So Gerald Malone and his colleagues may be right in challenging the
claim that patients would be unscathed by guerrilla action. What they
have yet to discover is the extent to which the public will tolerate the
pain -- and who'll get the blame if they don't.

PARIS: French authorities issued a health alert yesterday after
tracing an outbreak of listeria to Brie de Meaux cheese. The Health
Ministry said 17 cases of the bacterial infection that can cause
pneumonia and meningitis were traced to the soft cheese produced around
Meaux, east of Paris. Suspect cheeses were withdrawn from shops and
controls were stepped up by producers.

The tragic irony of his whole career has been that every triumph has
turned to ashes.
'IF we in this House can't be trusted to govern ourselves, how can we
be trusted to govern the country?'' In this week's debate on the Nolan
report, the Father of the House has put his finger on the nub of the
problem. As so often with Sir Edward Heath, however, the effect may be
the opposite of what he intends. For many the mounting evidence that MPs
cannot govern themselves merely confirms that they are not fit to run
the country.
It is more than 20 years since Ted Heath ceased to be Prime Minister.
His brief premiership collapsed in the ignominious confusion of the
now-legendary three-day week; within a year he was rejected by his party
in favour of an inexperienced woman who systematically stamped on
practically everything he had stood for.
For 15 years he was consigned to the political doghouse, despised,
derided, and virtually written out of Tory party history as an
embarrassing mistake. Yet he has refused to go away. Now 79, he has
remained defiantly unbowed. He has never given an inch to his critics,
never retired, never accepted a peerage, never even written his memoirs,
but has stayed on to become not so much the Father as the Grandfather of
the House, while men and women 15 years his junior, many of whom were
not even in the House when he was Prime Minister, have come and gone.
A whole generation has grown up for whom his baleful presence --
slumped impassively in his corner seat below the gangway or choleric on
television, furiously denouncing his successor or her pygmy acolytes --
has been a permanent feature of political life.
With age he has become an institution. The British revere longevity --
even an appalling old rogue like Manny Shinwell was practically
canonised for outliving all his contemporaries -- and if Heath is still
not exactly loved, he is respected and appreciated as he never was in
his heyday. And he is listened to. Nowadays he is one of the few Members
who addresses the House without a note, the authority of long experience
illuminated with a pawky wit he never showed when reading stiffly from a
Treasury brief. On Thursday he actually had Tory backbenchers cheering
him.
Leaving aside the question of whether he is throwing his weight on the
right side in the present argument, it is good to have one elder
statesman in the Commons. In recent years senior politicians have
increasingly cut and run to the City and the House of Lords as soon as
their ministerial careers were over: two generations of Mrs Thatcher's
key ministers -- Pym, Prior, Whitelaw, Joseph, Jenkin and Nott of the
first wave (of whom Nott alone did not go to the Lords); followed by
Howe, Lawson, Tebbit, Parkinson, Wakeham, Walker and others in the
second -- have followed that primrose route.
Kenneth Baker is still there, and Norman Fowler, Paul Channon, and Tom
King; but the heavyweights are all gone -- including, of course, the
Lady herself. On the Labour side, Tony Benn soldiers on, and Peter
Shore; but Dennis Healey is badly missed. In a young House in which the
Prime Minister goes back only to 1979, Benn, Shore, and Heath are the
only figures left whose experience of government stretches to the 1960s.
As the House marks VE Day, Heath alone speaks for the generation which
fought the Second World War.
Of course, the cut-and-run culture of modern politics, the abuse of
Parliament as a means of self-enrichment, is exactly what the Nolan
Committee has been investigating, and this is one area in which Heath's
long perspective does appear to be simply out of date. He is of a
generation which genuinely entered politics from a spirit of public
service which, with very few exceptions, was able to rely on an
unwritten code of public ethics.
It does him credit that he cannot accept that the Riddicks and
Tredinnicks of today do not share the same motivation; but sadly the
evidence is that they do not. At the same time he has always kept his
own personal finances shrouded. He too has his consultancies (notably
the public review board of the international accountants Arthur
Andersen) and he charges a hefty fee for sharing his wisdom on the
international lecture circuit.
He is by no means averse to making money where he can. But as he
insisted on Thursday: ''There is such a thing as the privacy of the
individual.'' Again it is a generational thing. Like Enoch Powell, who
refused on principle to recognise the Register of Members' Interests
(and got away with it because his personal reputation for
incorruptibility was unquestionable), he believes that MPs must be
trusted because the possibility that they cannot be trusted is beyond
his comprehension.
What keeps him going? Why does he not take the peerage -- even the
earldom to which he is entitled -- and take himself off to the
comfortable rest home along the corridor where he could still intervene
in debates when he wished but need not be present every night to vote?
With the Government's majority in the Commons almost down to single
figures it is no joke for a man of nearly 80 to find himself a vital
statistic in the whip's arithmetic.
When Mrs Thatcher had majorities of over 100, they were glad when he
was absent. Now they need him there as regularly as the keenest tyro.
Fortunately, the tightest votes have been on the European issue, when he
has been most anxious to be there to help defeat the vandals who would
undo the one historic achievement of his premiership.
His driving force these past 20 years has been the need to vindicate
himself. There are other factors. You could say that he has nothing else
to do. Politics has been his whole life, ever since he was at Oxford.
What about music, and sailing?
Paradoxically he has had wider interests and skills outside politics
than any other recent party leader. By comparison, Mrs Thatcher was
altogether one-dimensional. Yet they have always been subordinated to
his primary dedication to the life of politics. His great difference
from Margaret Thatcher -- and Jim Callaghan, and Harold Wilson -- is
that they all had families to fall back on, and he has none; he has no
close relatives at all.
In a sense, Bexley is his family: he has sat for the same
constituency, give or take periodic boundary changes, for 45 years. Old
Bexley and Sidcup, as the seat is now called, gives him the continuity
and gradual change of an extended family: he has seen generations of his
constituents and party workers grow up and marry and replace themselves
as the older ones die off. Its importance to a bachelor MP cannot be
exaggerated.
The lack of a family also explains his tireless need to keep moving,
to keep his diary filled with travel and political engagements. If he
ever stopped he would have nothing to do. Of course, he could write his
memoirs. That is what every other politician of his seniority does. He
has had a contract with Widenfeld &amp; Nicolson for nearly 20 years. It
would make him money, and allow him the best possible platform to
vindicate himself. Yet he cannot do it, because he cannot bring himself
to stop, sit down, and reflect.
Looking back too closely at the disappointments of his Government
would be painful, and anyway, he is no writer -- as his banal
bestsellers on music, sailing, and travel paradoxically proved. To write
a serious book he would have to disappear from current politics for a
couple of years (as Mrs Thatcher, Denis Healey, Roy Jenkins, and others
all did while they were writing).
In practice, he would have to leave the Commons, which he is not
prepared to do. His defiant way of vindicating himself is to stick in
there fighting his corner, engaging vigorously in current controversies
by means of regular comparisons with past battles and his own record.
By sticking in there he has at least outlasted Margaret Thatcher. He
could never have given up while she still led his party; after her fall
he was sustained by the belief that the Tory party was coming back to
him. He had high hopes of Major at first, encouraged by his talk of
putting Britain ''at the heart of Europe''; he hoped that Major would
stamp on her legacy as she had stamped on his, making good his
reiterated assertion that Thatcherism was an aberration in the apostolic
Tory succession: Churchill, Eden, Macmillan, Home, Heath . . . Major.
He has been sorely disappointed by the actuality, particularly by
Major's unwillingness or inability to stand up to the anti-Europeans;
they have been allowed to make the party running to such an extent that
they have turned the politics of the past 30 years on its head, with
Labour now the European party and the Tories suspicious or downright
hostile.
The idea that a former Tory Chancellor could openly envisage leaving
the European Community would have been inconceivable, even in Mrs
Thatcher's day. In 1992, Heath believed that the European argument was
finally won. Now he finds that it has to be fought all over again. No
wonder he cannot retire.
It is a measure of his failure, however, that he is still the most
prominent European in the party. The fact is that having taken Britain
into the Community in 1973, and played the leading part in winning a
''Yes'' vote to stay in during the 1975 referendum, he must bear -- with
Roy Jenkins -- the main responsibility for having signally failed to
sell his European vision to the country over the next two decades.
The trouble was that he was so unpopular and discredited within the
party after 1975 that the European cause suffered from its association
with him, and even since 1990 his advocacy has tended to be
counterproductive. Europe has remained so particularly his issue that
no-one else -- not even Geoffrey Howe, who has come closest -- has been
able to match his identification with it.
He is still such a prickly old loner that the pro-Europeans within the
party have lacked a leader, with the result that the antis have been
allowed to make all the running. The tragic irony of Heath's whole
career has been that his every triumph has turned to ashes: he is cursed
with a sort of Midas touch in reverse.
Another cause which he took up nearly 30 years ago was Scottish
devolution. Unfortunately he did not get round to doing anything about
it in 1970-74, and after 1975 Mrs Thatcher reversed his commitment --
prompting the resignations from her front bench of Alick Buchanan-Smith
and Malcolm Rifkind.
Heath never resiled from his commitment, but so long as Mrs Thatcher
was in office it remained a non-starter; and here again Major has chosen
to follow her line rather than return to Heath's.
Now that Rifkind has put his head above the parapet again it may be
that Scotland will re-emerge as another fault line in the fractured Tory
party; in which case it will be interesting to see if Heath's support
for devolution will turn out as deadly as usual.
Will Sir Edward stand again in 1996 or 1997, by which time he will be
over 80? It begins to look seriously possible that he will. Shinwell
went on to the age of 86. David Lloyd George's record of 55 years
unbroken representation will surely be beyond him -- another 10 years --
but who knows?
It is inconceivable that he could lose Bexley (despite a majority of
only 15,000). He likes to joke about the ''Canadian scenario'' -- when
the Canadian Conservatives were reduced to just two parliamentary seats.
''Oh,'' he asks straight-faced: ''Who will be the other one?''
All the signs are that whatever fate awaits the British Tories in 1997
the Grandfather of the House will still be there to give young Blair the
benefit of his experience. The likelihood is that that there will be a
by-election in Old Bexley and Sidcup one day. But not for some time yet.

A WIDE range of projects to help tackle the social and economic
problems faced by people in some of Scotland's most deprived urban areas
are to receive #24m of aid for capital and running costs this year, the
Scottish Office announced yesterday.
Funding goes to 106 new projects submitted by local authorities, as
well as to 124 others to provide extended help or additions to budgets
which already benefit from the Urban Programme.
Among the initiatives to have funding approved are the Goodyear Site
Development Support Project, which provides recruitment and training
services to companies setting up on the former Goodyear Tyre Site in
Drumchapel, Glasgow.
It qualifies for capital costs of #9900 with annual running costs of
#80,300 for two years.
A total of #70,500 in capital costs goes to the East End Community Law
Centre in Glasgow, with annual running costs of #135,650, for four
years.
The centre will provide legal services, including social security,
debt and community care, to residents in the East End of the city.
Funding for capital and running costs also goes to the Maryhill
Community Health Project in Glasgow, which will provide a network of
community health volunteers who will encourage community participation
in healthy activities.
The Inverclyde Employment and Training Initiative, sponsored by
Strathclyde Regional Council, and, in Ayrshire, the Shortlees Community
Health and Safe Environment project, also receive assistance.
The Edinburgh Healthy Eating Project, sponsored by the city council,
which will set up food co-operatives and raise awareness about healthy
eating, gets #44,000 in capital costs and annual running costs of
#153,000 for four years.
Funding also goes to initiatives such as the Hamilton District Energy
Advice Project, the Young People's Outreach Project in Aberdeen and the
Employment Aftercare Project, run by the Whitfield Business Support
Group, in Dundee.
Scottish Office Minister for Urban Regeneration Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton said he was particularly pleased that the Urban
Programme was able to fund such a wide range of projects structured to
meet local needs.
Funding is awarded each year by the Scottish Office and a total of
1100 projects will be supported by the programme during 1995-96, with a
record total payout of #84.9m. Central government meets 75% of the costs
of approved projects, with the balance paid by sponsoring authorities.

THE advancement of women in local government has been set back a
decade, at least, as a result of reorganisation.
These are Councillor Jean McFadden's words, convener of the new
Glasgow City Council, who, along with other equal-opportunities
campaigners throughout Scotland, is dismayed that there is not one woman
among the chief executives appointed to Scotland's 29 new single-tier
authorities.
Their last hope vanished on Thursday when Ann Hughes, deputy chief
executive at Aberdeen District Council, failed to land the
#80,000-a-year job as chief executive of the new Renfrewshire authority.
The previous day, the cause of advancement for women suffered a
devastating blow when Ann Mearns, currently chief executive of Aberdeen
district, failed to get the #80,000 Aberdeen City Council job.
And last night Councillor McFadden called on Cosla to mount a survey
on attitudes to gender in light of the results.
She argued that the appointments process for the new authorities
presented an immediate hurdle for women. First, it was an internal local
government exercise and there are very few women who have yet reached
senior levels of management.
People with a realistic chance of being appointed to a chief executive
role had either to have been chief executive or deputy in the current
set-up, and there are very few women who had got that far.
Councillor McFadden stated: ''A lot of us involved with equal
opportunities work have been warning that this would happen.
''We'll just have to try a little harder to make sure that women are
appointed as either heads of departments or deputies.''
Councillor McFadden has not been without her own problems in terms of
the gender barrier. She recalls standing in for the Lord Provost of
Glasgow at a Remembrance Day parade, taking the salute at the cenotaph,
and afterwards hearing one man say to another: ''It's absolutely
preposterous for a woman to be taking the salute.''
Ironically, at exactly the same time she was taking the salute, the
Queen was doing likewise in London.
Vicki Nash, assistant chief executive of Fife Regional Council, and
one of the the more active members of WIPS (Women in Public Service),
expressed ''extreme disappointment'' that Anne Mearns didn't get the
job.
She said: ''I think this is a major setback. We must now ask existing
councils what they are doing to address the huge inequality in women's
place in management.''
Having applied for six posts and missed out on all of them, she has
direct experience of the problems facing female candidates.
While some councils conducted the process absolutely fairly, she
judged others to have given scant regard to good employment practice --
seeming to favour one candidate right from the start. This left other
candidates with the feeling that they were ''just going through the
motions''.
Even more disturbing, in her view, was the use made of social
occasions as part of the selection process at which she was subjected to
more personal questions than would have been allowed during a formal
interview.
Questions such as ''Do you have any children?'' or ''How do you feel
about combining work with having a family?'' left her with feelings of
anger and sadness.
Vicki Nash is also beginning to question the extent to which these
appointments were actually made on merit, as against politcal trading
and favours as part of the old-boy network.
She also argued that the majority of elected members were more
comfortable with the traditional male management style of command and
control rather than a more democratic, person-orientated style of
management that a woman might offer.
Another activist, who preferred not to be named, offered perhaps the
most withering assessment of the problems facing women applying for top
posts -- ''Men seem to prefer men, and a lot of women prefer men as
well.''
She explained: ''You get the feeling that being a woman you are being
short-listed simply because you are a woman.
''You then have the dilemma -- do you go to the interview just to get
them accustomed to seeing women as candidates, or do you quietly decline
the invitation to go to the interview?
''To what extent are we genuine candidates and to what extent are we
tokens? We never really know what footing we are on!''
Despite protestations to the contrary, it appears that local
authorities are perpetuating the time-honoured practice of choosing the
best man for the job.

PARIS is buzzing at the shift of political power not only to the right
but towards younger people and women. By giving nearly one third of the
Cabinet posts to women, the new French President, Jacques Chirac, and
his Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, appear to be taking a woman-friendly
stance. This latest extension of egalite, however, requires closer
inspection.
Only four of the dozen have full ministerial status -- for health,
environment, tourism and a new ministry for Solidarity between the
Generations. Elisabeth Hubert, 39, previously a junior health minister
and a doctor by training, takes over health and responsibility for
health insurance. It is the biggest job of the four, but significantly
reduced in scope from the portfolio once held by Simone Veil.
It could be something of a poisoned chalice. Dr Hubert faces exactly
the same challenge as her British counterpart, Virginia Bottomley: how
to balance the budget in the face of increased demand and spiralling
costs for treatment. A former deputy mayor of Paris, and MP for a Paris
constituency since 1986, Francoise de Panafieu, 46, is Minister for
Tourism. Colette Codaccioni, 53, a midwife and mother of five, who
became an MP only two years ago and is therefore little-known, becomes
Minister for Solidarity between the Generations. Equally unknown is the
new Environment Minister, Corinne Lepage.
The UK complement of two, in comparison, looks distinctly tokenistic.
Our Cabinet boasts only the sexy nurse and the primary school head.
However politically incorrect, the descriptions once given by Education
Secretary Gillian Shephard of herself and Health Secretary Virginia
Bottomley say more about the status of the two women in the 23-strong
line-up than any other ministerial pronouncement. When he appointed Mrs
Shephard and Mrs Bottomley in 1992 at his first reshuffle, John Major
was accused of adding women as an afterthought, since none had been
included in his first Cabinet.
Now, however, there are three women at minister of state level and a
further three at under-secretary of state. Ann Widdicombe, 46, is
Employment Minister, while two elder stateswomen have been poached from
the Lords for ministerial duties. Baroness Chalker, 52, is at the
Foreign Office, and Baroness Blatch, 56, at the Home Office.
Baroness Cumberledge, 51, is Under-Secretary of State for Health, the
Northern Ireland Office has Baroness Denton of Wakefield, 58, and career
MP Angela Browning, 47, is at Agriculture.
A former spokeswoman on women's affairs for the Labour Party, Marjorie
Mowlam, welcomed the new French appointments, saying: ''It is a
progressive step and a balance so much better than we have in the UK,
but the proof of the pudding will be in the progress of the women
through the system. Coming from a Parliament with only 37 women out of
650, well below 10%, I am not in a strong position to be critical of
others.''
She suggested that one of the fastest ways to change practices in
politics and Parliament criticised by the Nolan Committee is to make
sure there are more women. ''The Labour Party has more women than any
other party in the UK and has in place procedures which will increase
the number of women MPs by 40 or 50 at the next election,'' she added.
However, the party is facing a groundswell of rebellion in some
constituencies over the policy agreed last year of all-woman shortlists
of parliamentary candidates in half the seats where a sitting Labour MP
is retiring and in half the marginals regarded as winnable. Ms Mowlam
acknowledged that such policies can overtake general attitudes, but
argued that they were a short-term necessity.
Politicians are often counselled to take the long-term view, but in
this particular area impatience may be necessary. From 1918 to 1992,
there have been 338 Cabinet Ministers and 10 female Cabinet Ministers.
Based on 1992 figures, the UK's 7.4% of women in the national parliament
is one of the lowest in Europe, although France scores even lower at
5.6%. Highest is Denmark with 33%, followed by the Netherlands (30.2%),
Germany (25.6%), then Luxembourg (16.6%).
The latest French appointments have to be seen within the context of
their system, which does not require Ministers to be MPs. As a result,
some of the Cabinet appointments have been from the top ranks of local
government. Until Wednesday, Anne-Marie Couberc was responsible for the
environmental health of Paris. Newly responsible for press relations at
the Elysee is President Chirac's daughter, Claude, who ran his PR
campaign.
The French press corps are touting a simple explanation for the
Chirac-Juppe selection. Chirac is known to like women. This French
politician has no string of mistresses (not even one as far as is known)
but women journalists who have been on the campaign trail report that he
makes a habit of trying to seduce them, but never bears any ill-will
when rebuffed.

KIDNAPPING for ransom, the boom industry in South America and Italy in
the seventies until it slumped under the impact of harsh retaliation, is
making a comeback in Russia. In what one security expert described as
''Moscow's bear garden of criminality'', it has become common for
''biznizmeni'' to be ''lifted'' for ransom.
Very often this is a simple commercial arrangement, with one crooked
businessman being kidnapped by thugs hired by another because he has
defaulted on a deal. However, the climate of lawlessness is such that
foreign companies have now become the targets of protection rackets.
The kidnap gangs are growing increasingly expert. It is known that
they lifted more than 200 people last year, and many more incidents went
unreported.
It is not surprising, therefore, that companies with representatives
in Russia are taking out kidnap insurance on their employees. As a
result, the select group of British insurance companies which specialise
in kidnap insurance are enjoying something of a boom.
Their polices, underwritten by Lloyd's of London, offer a
comprehensive package which includes the reimbursement of ransom
payments; compensation for wages paid to the victim while he is unable
to do the company's work; fees for psychiatric care of traumatised
victims; and picking up the bill for a holiday for him and his family.
The policies can also involve the services of organisations such as
Control Risks -- the world's pre-eminent political and security risks
consultancy. Largely staffed by former policemen, SAS officers and
academics specialising in terrorist studies of one sort or another,
Control Risks has brought off some notable kidnap negotiations,
sometimes in the face of the disapproval of local governments and
considerable danger to its operatives.
The real trick, of course, is to avoid being lifted in the first
place. Most foreign companies in Russia employ local security
organisations staffed by former KGB men or veterans of the Afghan war
who are using their communist-acquired skills in the service of
capitalist businessmen.
One British security company, Defence Systems Limited, run by Alistair
Morrison, former second-in-command of the SAS and the man who led the
German unit in their successful assault on the hijacked Lufthansa
airliner in Mogadishu, has opened an office in Moscow to provide expert
advice and protection to foreign businessmen.
Another British company, S MacNeillie &amp; Son, which specialises in
armouring cars, has also tested the Moscow market.
And some tycoons have had microtransmitters implanted under their
skin, close to their heart. These devices -- the size of a grain of rice
-- relay a signal so that if their host is kidnapped he can be tracked
by the sound of his heartbeats.
0 It is when one of the unfortunate ''biznizmeni'' finds himself being
held to ransom in some unsalubrious Moscow cellar that the insurance men
come into play.
If the candidate comes up to scratch and a policy is issued, the cost
is worked out at about 1% a year of the ''ransom-worth'' of the insured
person.
Paying ransom is illegal in some countries and the insurance companies
insist they do not, in fact, pay ransom, but simply reimburse the policy
holder once the ransom has been paid.
The actual negotiations are usually carried out by a very special type
of loss-adjuster, whose job it is to ''bring 'em back alive'', at the
lowest possible cost. One of these men, like so many of them a former
SAS officer, told me: ''Once the first excitement is over, you have to
build a rapport with the kidnappers, find out about them and then try to
dominate them by setting the pattern of the negotiations. The task is to
keep the victim alive but at the same time whittle away the kidnappers'
original, always exaggerated, demands.''
If all goes well, the money will be handed over by a trusted friend;
the victim will be restored to the bosom of his family; the policy will
be paid out by the underwriters; the negotiator will wipe the sweat from
his brow, and the kidnappers will go home singing and dancing.

IF the recession has taught the fashion-conscious one thing, it is
that it's far easier to look stylish by paring down the psychedelic
muddle of colours in their wardrobe to just three or four. It is a
practice often preached by fashion professionals and for good reason. It
is easier to pack a concise group of co-ordinates that work for them on
their globe-trotting buying trips, than to drag a huge suitcase through
an airport terminal.
It is a concept which several German brand names have pursued with
their mix-and-match collections, but they have never quite abandoned
that irritating habit of overdoing it with the gilt and tacky
embroidery. The subtlety of the Italian master of the tailored jacket,
Giorgio Armani, has re-educated our tastes in colour, cut and style. And
he now plays a greater influence in our choice of clothes in the 90s
than many would care to admit.
One top name to have picked up this mood swing and make the subtle,
carefully thought out wardrobe part of its design philosophy, is Jaeger.
In autumn 1993, the company launched a special, tightly-edited
collection with strong international appeal, called Jaeger London.
Initial trials proved it to be simpatico with the demand of the modern
woman's lifestyle. And, according to Jaeger's retail figures,
particularly those who reside in Glasgow. From a handful of London shops
the collection has been rolled out to their key stores around the world
and Glasgow is quickly posting the highest sales figures, after London.
Jaeger London is an understated design-led collection including 50
pieces edited to just three colours. Sand and black with violet used as
the accent shade, is the tightest colour palette given to a range beyond
the monochromatic caprices of the international catwalk. The
collection's hallmarks are the cut, beautiful fabrics and fastidious
attention to detail -- no gold braid in sight. In brief, these are
modern classics with a twist.
The collection, made in Scotland, springs from the sketch pad of
Jaeger's Fife-born international design director Jeanette Todd, who also
creates the company's main line. Unlike that one, Jaeger London is
designed much closer to the season, ''which means I can be more
responsive to fashion and how I feel'', Todd said.
''The collection is fun with fashion-forward styling,'' but she
doesn't get carried away. ''It is important the colours are neutral with
just one highlight shade and produced in top-quality fabrics (mainly
Italian), which play on the subtleties of texture.''
This spring her tailoring is either long and lean, or short, belted,
and teamed with a button-through skirt. Violet silk shirts or slinky rib
knits make an unusual colour accent to the subtly-shaded suits. Suede
trousers are teamed with silk blouses in an insouciantly chic manner and
dresses are tailored linen. The only prints are marbled or floral
gorgette, softly shaped into halter-neck top and drawstring pants. The
clever thing is, they all work harmoniously together.
* Jaeger London is available from Jaeger, Buchanan Street, Glasgow,
and Princes Street, Edinburgh.

<HEADLINE>Jurassic peace breaks out over fossils</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978305257</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LONG-STANDING rift between a farmer and a sculptor over fossil
remains of Jurassic Age reptiles from a Sutherland beach has been
healed, with the return of most of the samples to a local museum.
Mr Michael Dudgeon, of Crakaig Farm, Loth, who has unearthed several
spectacular fossils -- most recently one he claims could be a
''dinosaur's egg'' -- has reached agreement with Mrs Pamela Jenkins, of
Edinburgh, who presented one of her rare finds to the Royal Scottish
Museum in the city.
Mrs Jenkins has donated the rest of her fossils of small vertebrae and
reptile head fragments of millions of years ago to the Timespan Museum
in Helmsdale. She has also handed over a photograph of the
aspidorhynchus reptile head she painstakingly washed out of limestone
with acids for the Edinburgh collection.
Mr Dudgeon's mother, Mary, who is president of Helmsdale Heritage
Society, said that she was ''thrilled to bits'' with the return to
Sutherland of the fossil finds, which came from her beach and links.
Mr Dudgeon said that the presentation of the fossils by Mrs Jenkins
marked ''a reconciliation'' between them. ''We are now all friends
together.''
American-born Mrs Jenkins, wife of a Fife-based doctor, said she was
''delighted'' that her finds had been accepted by Timespan for
exhibition. She had picked up the Loth fossils -- which no one else
appeared to recognise as prehistoric remains of creatures -- over a
period of six years during her husband's angling trips to Sutherland.
Mr Dudgeon himself found a ''priceless'' fossil section of a
prehistoric reptile's backbone last year on his farm, which he has also
now presented on loan to the museum. From its size, the creature must
have been fully 20 feet long.
Also on loan is what he considers a ''dinosaur's egg'', an oval-shaped
fossil found by Mrs Dudgeon's cousin, Mr Richard Longfield, from
Hampshire, while walking along the beach last month. Golspie geologist
Mr Hugh Shelley is non-commital on the egg theory, calling it a
''nodule'', which would have to be cut open to prove its worth.
When the fossils were handed over in the geology section of Timespan,
Mrs Dudgeon said she considered they would ''make the most thrilling
exhibit, because so many people were fascinated these days by dinosaurs,
particularly children.
''We could obviously have quite a large exhibit on the dinosaur and
prehistoric fossils of Loth. We have resided here for many years and
we're only now discovering the exciting things that are lying about.''
Mrs Jenkins said that, rather than from dinosaurs, the fossilised
remains they were picking up were probably from the swimming reptiles of
350 million years ago -- the plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs.
Some of these reptiles were as long as 40 feet and some as big as 90
feet. Others were only centimetres long, and one of her fossils showed
just a tiny fish-like jaw with a minuscule tooth sticking out. Other
pieces demonstrate sections of backbone and compacted spinal columns.

THROUGHOUT this century, new fibres from polyester to PVC have been
hailed as materials of the future. Most have now fallen from grace.
Other hi-tech fabrics such as Lycra are still very much with us. An
exhibition at Edinburgh's Fruitmarket Gallery called 2010 -- Textiles
and New Technology looks at the new trends and the link between textiles
and design, fashion, craft, science, and architecture. Some high-fibre
designers use brand new fabrics in time-honoured ways while others
combine traditional materials and innovative manufacturing techniques.
For the past few years, unforgiving Lycra has remodelled the female
silhouette. Without Lycra, leggings, cycling shorts, and the micro-skirt
would have been impossible and all sorts of other well-fitted clothes
would sag and wrinkle at all the wrong places. So versatile is Lycra, a
by-product of the petrochemical industry, that it is also now used in
underwear, men's suits and shoes.
A new fabric may give Lycra a run for its money. Tencel (from
Courtauld's) has great strength, softness and low shrinkage. It's a
fibre that comes in various modes -- from a cotton lookalike to a
material much like denim. Helen Storey and Zandra Rhodes were among the
first British designers to use it. More expensive than the natural
fabrics it emulates, Tencel is far more durable.
Japan initiates many of the new developments in textiles. The Japanese
have a strong tradition of using fabric in new ways. Fashion designer
Issey Miyake's influences come from kimonos and Samurai costumes and he
is famed for simple rectilinear garments made from swathes of fabric.
For the Japanese, tight clothing is not sexy. So, for Miyake, sensuality
is found in large volumes of fabric, luxuriously textured, cut in almost
abstract shapes.
''The idea for the 2010 exhibition came from seeing unusual and
beautiful fabrics from Japan using traditional techniques in combination
with advanced technology,'' says Sarah Braddock, one of the two curators
of the exhibition, and a lecturer in visual art at Goldsmith's College,
London.
In recent years the area of textiles has got a lot broader with the
gap between art and science shrinking quickly. Unlikely combinations of
natural and synthetic fibres can create materials with never-dreamt-of
capabilities and appearance (one silk-like material seems to have
aluminium shot through it). Where once man-made yarns attempted to mimic
natural ones, now whole new kinds of materials can be produced.
New textiles are also being used in such fields as architecture.
Tented structures have, for some years, been used for sports centres and
warehouses. The natural flexibility in tensile fabrics means that
buildings can move in high winds, accommodate climatic change, stress or
earthquake tremors. These factors can be simulated on computer at the
R&amp;D stage, another aspect explored in the exhibition.
''Smart'' fabrics is an area that is being heavily researched by the
Japanese. Some of these fabrics, like those thermochromic T-shirts that
change colour with body temperature are clearly gimmicks, others have
long-term capabilities. The smart bra regains its shape in certain
temperatures during washing. The smart carpet monitors the
characteristic of people walking on it (height, weight and even sex) --
ideal for security systems.
Are we destined in the future to be clad in one-piece stretch
jumpsuits a la Star Trek? What will we be wearing in 2010?
''Materials that will give a lot more, material that will support,''
says Sarah Braddoch. ''Material that will bounce back into shape will
have a big future.''
* The 2010 -- Textiles and New Technology exhibition runs at the
Fruitmarket Gallery, Market Street, Edinburgh (0131-225 2383) until June
10. On June 9 there will be a day-long forum at the gallery.

<HEADLINE>Judgment reserved on MoD'anti-homosexual' policy</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978305259</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE High Court yesterday reserved judgment on an attempt by three gay
Servicemen and a woman for a test case ruling that they have been
unfairly and unlawfully sacked from the armed forces.
The four asked Lord Justice Simon Brown and Mr Justice Curtis to
declare the Ministry of Defence anti-homosexual policy ''perverse and
irrational''.
The judges said after a five-day hearing that they would take time to
consider their decision.
Former Lieutenant Commander Duncan Lustig-Prean, 36, from London, the
most senior of the four, was dismissed from the Royal Navy as
''unsuitable'' at the end of last year, only months after being
commended by his commanding officer.
The other three applicants for judicial review are former RAF Sergeant
Graeme Grady, 32, from London; former RAF nurse Jeanette Smith, 28, from
Edinburgh; and former Royal Navy weapons engineer John Beckett, 25, from
Sheffield.
They want Britain to lift the ban so they can resume their careers,
which were highly successful.
During the hearing, the Ministry of Defence urged the High Court not
to intervene in the controversy but wait for Parliament to take a fresh
look at the issue.
Mr Stephen Richards, for the MoD, said the matter had been
periodically reviewed by the ad hoc House of Commons select committee on
the Armed Forces Bill, and he had no doubt it would be looked at again
in the 1995-96 parliamentary session.
An Armed Forces Act was due in 1996.
Until now, the military authorities' judgment was that homosexuals
could be ''disruptive'' and affect the efficiency of the fighting
services.
Mr Richards said it was a view which might change, but that was a
matter for the military and politicians and not for the courts.

* SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang yesterday opened the #15.23m second
phase of the new National Library of Scotland's building in
Causewayside, Edinburgh.
It will provide storage space for the library's collection well into
the next century.
The opening of the second phase of the building completed a project
begun in 1980.
The entire building has seven floors and occupies a total area of
19,170 square metres.
It accommodates staff departments, including the map library and the
Scottish science library, and book storage on mobile stacks.
The National Library of Scotland is Scotland's largest library.
Founded in 1689 as the Library of the Faculty of Advocates, it is one
of five legal deposit libraries, with the right to claim a copy of every
work published in the United Kingdom.
The library currently houses about 6.5 million printed items, l00,000
volumes of manuscripts, l.5 million maps, and more than 20,000 different
newspaper and magazine titles. Each week, about 7000 printed items are
added to its stock.

EDINBURGH'S main post office is moving to a new site in the St James
Centre from the building in Waterloo Place it has occupied for more than
a century.
Post Office Counters said the #500,000 move to the former TSB bank
will improve services. It will retain its status as a Crown Post Office
with directly employed staff. All would be transferred to the new
premises.
Meanwhile, the future of Glasgow's George Square Post Office remains
in the balance.
National Galleries of Scotland still is considering the building as a
future home, and the Post Office confirmed yesterday that it would be
going ahead with moves to sell it.
A PO spokeswoman said: :''George Square is going up for sale. From the
counters point of view we are looking at three potential city centre
sites in Glasgow which will provide more positions than George Square.
''The building is too big, and there is limited parking for customers
and staff. The new sites would be more accessible for those in the
business and shopping centre of the city.''
A spokeswoman for National Galleries added that the building still was
being considered an option as new premises for a National Gallery of
Scottish Art.
''Our proposals have not yet been presented to the Secretary of State
for Scotland, and our preparations are ongoing,'' she said.
On the Edinburgh move, the head of POC's retail network, Geraldine
Collie said the switch to the nearby St James Centre would offer more
counter positions, among the first in the UK without glass security
screens, and significant benefit for customers including longer opening
hours.
''It will provide a modern and bright environment and will allow
better access for the disabled as well as being nearer to car parking
and the bus station,'' she added.
The Post Office sold the Waterloo Place site last August to property
developer Raglan. Since then it has occupied the site on a short-term
lease which is due to expire later this year. The move to the St James
Centre is expected to take place in early autumn.
Raglan plans to convert the site into four separate office buildings
and possibly some flats, around a central courtyard.
Royal Mail delivery services covering central Edinburgh will move to
the sorting depot in Brunswick Road.

A JUNIOR hospital doctor was yesterday cleared of the manslaughter of
a patient who was mistakenly given an injection in his brain.
Samuel Beers, 36, died in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital in
February 1994, two days after Dr Yin Yin Teoh injected penicillin into a
tube leading to his brain instead of one to his wrist.
In his summing-up, Mr Justice Pringle reminded the jury at Belfast
Crown Court that at the time the defendant had been tired after a
14-hour shift finishing with eight hours looking after more than 100
patients in two wards on her own.
The jury took less than 45 minutes to clear the 25-year-old Malaysian
doctor, who denied unlawfully killing Mr Beers, a father of two, of
Newtownards, County Down. He suffered a cardiac arrest after the
injection was administered.
During the trial, the court was told that since Mr Beers's death the
hospital had instituted new procedures for colour-marking and labelling
tubes.
At the time of the tragedy, there was no way to differentiate between
the tubes except to follow them to their source, which Dr Teoh told the
court she had done with care.
She said that after disentangling the tubes she might have made a
mistake while reaching for the syringe.
Immediately after the injection was given, she realised a mistake
might have been made and she reported the matter to senior doctors.
Outside court, Dr Teoh said: ''I believe the decision to prosecute me
for manslaughter arising out of my mistake was unjust and should not
have been taken.''
She had co-operated throughout but it was almost 12 months before she
was told she would be prosecuted.
Mrs Natalie Beers, the victim's widow, criticised a hospital system
which she said had allowed junior doctors to work long hours ''with high
risk to individuals''.
''The system should have been perfect, and the hierarchy in the RVH
should sit up and take notice.
Since Mr Beers's death, Dr Teoh has qualified as a senior house
officer at the RVH, where she works in the ophthalmology department.

<TEXT>
FIFE-born property developer John Doherty, 44, and a Barlays Bank
manager who are accused of plotting a #10m fraud, were further remanded
in their absence until August 10 at a City of London magistrates' court
yesterday.
Mr Doherty, who gave a London address, and Mr Guy Wheeler, 54, of
Gonalston, Nottinghamshire, are charged with conspiring together to
defraud finanicial institutions to believe that a forged bank guarantee,
purportedly issued by Barclays Bank, Derby was genuine.
Mr Wheeler who runs a major branch in Derby and supervises seven
Barclays branches, is currently on #25,000 bail.
His two sisters-in-law stood as sureties in the sums of #12,500 each.
The magistrates also ordered Mr Wheeler to reside at his recorded
address, surrender his passport, not apply for any travel documents and
not contact witnesses or either of his co-defendants.
Mr Doherty was released on #50,000 bail and was ordered to obey the
same conditions, as well as reporting twice weekly to Belgravia police
station.
Mr Doherty faces a second charge that on October 3, 1994 at the Great
Eastern Hotel, Liverpool Street, London together with persons unknown he
dishonestly handled stolen share certificates worth #1.5m.
On this charge, he was remanded on bail until June 10 for a committal
for trial.
A charge against a third man Maurice O'Leary, 48, unemployed, of
Bexleyheath, London, was withdrawn.

A GREENPEACE application for permission to bring a High Court
challenge over the Brent Spar was adjourned by Mr Justice Popplewell in
London yesterday. The pressure group is applying for a judicial review
of the Scottish Secretary's decision to grant a licence to Shell UK for
the disposal of the installation in deep water.
The judge questioned whether the English courts were the proper venue,
or whether the application should be made in Scotland. He gave
Greenpeace lawyers until next Wednesday to produce evidence to support
its contention that the Scottish courts were unlikely to recognise it
and this amounted to ''special reasons'' for a hearing going ahead in
London, as England was very much affected.

A FISHING trawler chartered by Greenpeace left Lerwick last night for
the Brent Spar amid fears that operators Shell had sent a vessel to take
action against the Greenpeace activists who have occupied the North Sea
oil installation for the past three weeks.
Earlier, a Court of Session judge granted an order to evict Mr
Jonathan Castle, the named leader of the Greenpeace activists, from the
Spar. The environmentalists are occupying it in protest at Shell plans
to scuttle it in the Atlantic when it is decommissioned.
Lord Johnston also ordered Mr Castle to divulge the names of his
fellow-protesters and the organisations and bodies behind the
occupation.
Greenpeace decided to send a boat with activists and members of the
international media aboard to witness any action by Shell following a
number of calls to the organisation claiming that a vessel owned by
Shell, the Stadive, was in the vicinity of the Spar.
A spokesman for Shell UK said the Stadive was carrying out normal
maintenance work in the Dunlin field about 50 miles from the Spar. He
added that he could not say if it was likely to move from the Dunlin
field to the Spar.
Greenpeace spokeswoman, Ms Mary Morrison, said the group was waiting
for court officers to serve an eviction order on the activists' leader
Mr Castle.
Ms Morrison said that the volunteers aboard the Spar had received
legal advice, but it would be up to them how they reacted to demands
from court officers to leave the installation.
The Starina fishing-vessel with six or seven people on board was to
take about 12 hours to reach the Spar, which is about 116 miles
North-east of Lerwick.
In court in Edinburgh yesterday, Brent Spar owner, Shell UK, asked
Lord Johnston for an order for summary ejection of all the protesters
who are objecting to plans to sink the installation in the Atlantic
under the terms of a Government licence.
Lord Kirkwood had granted an interim interdict at the Court of Session
last week banning the protesters from occupying the platform.
Last Friday night, messengers-at-arms were flown by helicopter to the
platform and served Lord Kirkwood's order on 11 unnamed individuals and
one, Mr Jonathan Castle, who had given his name.
Mr Gerard Moynihan, counsel for Shell, told Lord Johnston at the Court
of Session on Thursday that the protesters were trespassing, had been
ordered to leave by the court, but had refused to do so. They were on
the Brent Spar in clear contempt of the court order.
Lord Johnston, who reserved his decision overnight, said yesterday
that he was in little doubt that those on board the Brent Spar were
fully aware that they were flouting the court order to remove themselves
from the platform.
However, the problem about granting an eviction order against unnamed
people was that if, as he had been informed, there were now different
people on board the platform, the order might not catch the people on
whom the original order had been served.
The judge referred to previous cases in which the court decided it was
not appropriate to grant orders against unnamed persons.
However, he added that the position of Mr Castle, the one protester
named in Shell's application for a warrant to evict, was entirely
different.
Mr Castle has described himself as the ''Captain'' of Greenpeace on
Brent Spar and Lord Johnston said: ''I consider that he is in breach of
the court's order ordaining him to leave the platform and that I am
entitled to enforce that by granting an eviction order against him.
''When faced with a named person who is in flagrant breach of its
orders the court has power to act.''
Lord Johnston said he would also grant an order against Mr Castle,
requiring him to provide Shell with the names and addresses of others
who had been on the Brent Spar since April 30 and the organisation or
bodies behind the occupation of the platform.
He added that it should be made very clear to Mr Castle that the court
would take action if he failed to disclose the identities of his fellow
protesters.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Trades Union Congress has voted to send a
message of support to Greenpeace in its campaign, because of the jobs
decommissioning on land would create.

Clare Henry ponders the gallery chief's future and Rob Roberston tells
how the race was decided
AFTER months of interviews and keen media speculation, Mr Timothy
Clifford, 49, the director of the National Galleries of Scotland,
yesterday saw his lifelong ambition of being director of London's
Victoria and Albert Museum elude his grasp.
Dr Alan Borg, 53, the squeaky clean, discreet but dull director of the
Imperial War Museum landed Britain's most challenging museums job,
controlling a #34m budget, 860 staff, and a superlative -- but badly
housed -- treasure trove of decorative arts from all over the world.
Luckily, the current director of the National Galleries of Scotland is
a robust character. Minutes later, he said: ''I'm going to pick myself
up, dust myself down, and start all over again.''
His booming laugh echoed on the telephone. ''I've got the Dean Centre,
the RSA, outstations in Paxton House and Duff House, and a new National
Gallery of Scotland in Glasgow. It's going to be a good year.''
Then he wasn't looking for other pastures new? ''Certainly not.
Absolutely not. We've got major acquisitions via the lottery too. Very
exciting. And, having negotiated the Paolozzi museum and such like, I
can have fun implementing them.''
So what went wrong? In the press, Clifford was always seen as the most
obvious contender, ''the only man for the job''. He reached the final
round and the short-list of four, while Mr Julian Spalding was rejected
much earlier on.
It seems that Mr Clifford's huge talent for indiscretion -- a habit
for opening his mouth and putting his foot in it -- was the problem. His
gaffe over the Getty family nearly cost the nation the Three Graces
sculpture, and certainly lost him the V &amp; A job.
Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, chairman of the V &amp; A board of trustees,
was appalled at his blunder and rated it amateur.
(Clifford had claimed that John-Paul Getty's motivation in giving #1m
to prevent the export was to get back at his father. The project was
only rescued and the cash secured by public grovelling.)
So, like it or not, we're stuck with him. I for one am relieved.
Scotland would be a much sorrier place without his colourful exuberance.
I'm glad the door of the V &amp; A firmly closed in his face.
And now that the status quo is confirmed, a lot of others also seem to
find they are pleased, for Mr Clifford, though volatile, shamelessly
ambitious, indiscreet, and above all English, has panache, energy, rare
style, and humanity.
''If I was the chairman I'd have him like a shot,'' Sir Simon Hornby,
ex-chairman of WH Smith, chairman of ABSA, and President of the Royal
Horticultural Society, told me before the announcement.
''If the V &amp; A doesn't, it shows a lack of courage. Robert Armstrong
is a friend of mine, but I doubt if he'll take Tim on.''
Showman or scholar? Which way would the trustees jump in a
recessionary era which favours the safe-choice appointment? Well Sir
Simon was right. The V &amp; A board of 18 trustees, chaired by Lord Robert
Armstrong, (coiner of the euphemism ''economical with the truth'')
obviously decided they needed a safe pair of hands.
This says more about Lord Armstrong and the V &amp; A than about Mr
Clifford, whose passion for the decorative arts would have ensured that
he grasped the problem nettles at the V &amp; A -- there are many -- turned
the place around and put it on the map.
Meanwhile, Mr Clifford has problems of his own. Plans for the new
National Gallery of Scotland in Glasgow are no nearer solution, and some
recent reports would have us believe the project is falling apart at the
seams.
After 18 months wrangling over a Scottish Gallery, which split
Scotland as never before, it was learned this week that the building
proposed for the new gallery, the Post Office in George Square, is to be
advertised for sale at around #10m to the highest bidder.
While the story of Post office building as carpark is obviously wrong
(planning permission rules it out), the Royal Mail which owns the
building claims that no formal, or informal, approach has been made by
the trustees. Clifford denies this.
So while Dr Borg must find #100m to keep the V &amp; A in good repair and
begin the massive Albertopolis millennium development needed to cope
with problems of space and access, Mr Clifford is back with the task of
bridging the east-west divide and dispersing some of his collection to
Glasgow. Who am I to say which will prove the more difficult?

A SCOTTISH choral society managed to avoid cancelling a performance
after an Irish singer answered a Europe-wide appeal.
It will mean a first ever appearance on a Scottish stage for Irish
singer Collette McGahon, a rising star of the European opera circuit.
The 180 singers and musicians of Inverness Choral Society preparing
for a concert tonight in the Eden Court Theatre were left without a
soloist when mezzo-soprano Yvonne Burnett called from London to pull
out, just 48 hours before the curtain was due to go up.
The Aberdeen-born professional had a sore throat and so could not sing
the lead in the first-ever performance in the Highlands of Elgar's
masterpiece The Dream of Gerontius.
But the show must go on. So Mr Alan Simpson, the society's president,
began telephoning everyone he knew in the music scene to track down a
replacement for the concert.
He said: ''I started looking for a stand-in as soon as I heard the
awful news about Yvonne at six on Thursday evening. I finally found a
wonderful soloist in Dublin called Collette McGahon, and at a quarter to
one on Friday morning she finally faxed her agreement to sing.
''Collette is the fourth we have had in this position since we started
to plan the concert. The first two asked to be released from their
contracts when bigger offers from the Continent came along.'
Yesterday Ms McGahon, of Dundalk, County Louth, said she could not
wait to sing in Scotland. ''I just checked if I could get there in time
and then accepted'', she said.
She added: ''My first professional job was as an understudy at
Scottish Opera, but I was never called to sing. This will be my first
time on the Scottish stage.''

MR Timothy Clifford said last night that he was sad at being pipped
for the #80,000-a-year post as head of the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London.
It is believed it was a close-run thing between Mr Borg and Mr
Clifford. The other candidates on the short-list were Mr Timothy
Stevens, assistant director of the V &amp; A, and Mr Edmund Capon, director
of the New South Wales Gallery, Australia.
In announcing the appointment, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, chairman
of the board of trustees at the V &amp; A, said that all four candidates
could have made able leaders of the museum. However, he added, the
trustees had felt that Dr Borg had the mix of attributes that suited the
V &amp; A's current needs.
Mr Clifford said: ''I am naturally sad not to have the opportunity to
direct the Victoria and Albert museum, a museum where I once worked and
one for which I have the greatest regard and affection.
''I feel very privileged to have acted as director of the National
Galleries of Scotland for more than 10 years and look forward to
continuing to run the galleries for many years to come.'' He said that
he was blessed with an excellent staff and supportive board at the
National Galleries.
Looking to the future, Mr Clifford said the galleries had a very
lively exhibition and acquisition programme planned for the summer.
These include the proposal for a new National Gallery in Glasgow, the
refurbishment of the Royal Scottish Academy, and the opening of a new
sculpture gallery at the Dean Centre, Edinburgh, in two years' time.
The current director of the V &amp; A, Elizabeth Esteve-Coll, leaves in
September, after nearly eight years in charge, to become the
Vice-Chancellor of the University of East Anglia. Dr Borg will be given
an initial five-year contract. He is married to Lady Caroline Hill and
has two daughters.

TONY Blair glad-handed his way through affluent rural Perthshire
yesterday to increase his party's standing in the final days of the
by-election campaign, with a claim that there were no longer any no-go
areas for New Labour.
His message that Labour now represented the ''middle way'' in British
politics was taken to the streets of Crieff and Auchterarder, which were
brought to a standstill by the Blair entourage.
Mr Blair said voters in Perth and Kinross now faced a two-way fight
between Labour and the SNP and they did not want the ''separatism or
extremism'' of the latter. ''They want the Conservatives out, but they
want to vote for the moderate, middle way and they want to make the
Government listen.
''The important thing is that there are lots of places where the
people have not traditionally supported Labour. But today's Labour Party
has no no-go areas. People are crying out for an alternative to the
Conservatives. People are coming with us and we certainly can win.''
Conservative claims of a ''dirty tricks campaign'' were scorned by
rivals, and appeared to unravel last night when a disenchanted Tory
voter at the centre of the row gave a different version of events from
the party organisers.
The day had begun with allegations that mysterious telephone
canvassers were going beyond candidate Mr John Godfrey's request to vote
for ''anyone but the SNP'' and were urging people to vote Labour.
Campaign manager Mr Raymond Robertson insisted that no-one from the
party had told canvassers to say any such thing and, though he was
making ''no assumptions'' about the origin of the calls, he clearly
implied Labour was responsible.
However, the woman involved in the incident, in the Tullylumb area,
said the telephone caller had not specifically mentioned Labour.
This made it unlikely that any other party stood to gain, but
Conservative Party officials continued to insist last night that they
had conducted no telephone canvass of the area at the time in question.
Shadow Scottish Secretary Mr George Robertson said there was no dirty
tricks campaign and the Tories were in such trouble that no-one would
have to resort to anything of that kind.
SNP leader Mr Alex Salmond said the Tory campaign had been a farce up
till now and they were trying to turn it into a detective story.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Menzies Campbell said the Tory campaign
had been a ''catalogue of ineptitude'' and the latest accusation sounded
like the last throw of the dice for a desperate man.

THE new Laird of Eigg, German artist Professor Marlin Eckhard Maruma,
had hoped that the island would be wreck-free before he visits it again
next month. But it looks as though he will be disappointed.
Like many of Scotland's smaller islands, Eigg has had difficulty in
disposing of old cars, farm-machinery, tractors, and other metallic
equipment. Their rusting remains have now become an accepted part of
many island landscapes.
The islanders on Eigg, as elsewhere, have been asking the authorities
to help for the past 10 years. But hard-pressed councils have been
unable to oblige. Lochaber District Council, for example, has a total
budget for wreck removal of just #1500.
When Professor Maruma visited the island last month, he was
disappointed to see the amount of scrap that was lying about and said he
was anxious to have a clean up.
A bulldozer has been gathering the wrecks together, but suggestions
that Lochaber District Council were preparing to send a special ferry to
remove the scrap are apparently unfounded.
The council's director of environmental health, Mr John Hearmon, said
yesterday: ''That suggestion was made by the owner's representatives,
but it is not our responsibility to send a ferry, and we are not doing
so. There will be a discussion at next month's meeting of the
environmental health committee on how we can remove the waste that can
be recycled.''
Mrs Karen Helliwell, secretary of the Eigg Residents' Association,
said: ''We have been pushing for the past 10 years to get something done
about our waste. If we do get the council to remove the recyclable
waste, it will represent the greatest progress we have made in that
time.''

POETRY and jazz together haven't always made for the best evening out
but Tommy Smith has been sufficiently inspired by the poems of Norman
McCaig to produce not only his own strongest composition to date but
some of the best jazz writing in the UK in recent years.
The 14 pieces collectively known, for CD title purposes at least, as
Misty Morning and No Time form that rarity, the jazz suite which hangs
together so well that interruptions for things like applause become a
hindrance. Adam McNaughton, in reading the inspirational words,
consequently might have assumed the role of intruder if his expertly
weighted delivery hadn't explained consistently the nuances in the notes
that followed.
Smith in the past has at times been accused of having a limited
emotional range, of being too cerebral. Here, there was warmth and
humour, sadness too, as well as some beautifully judged playing by all
the band. Particularly effective was the leader's superbly controlled
breathy tenor saxophone which introduced Memorial, accompanied only by
Steve Hamilton's cool piano playing until trumpeter Guy Barker and alto
saxophonist Julian Arguelles arrived to suggest a slightly off-centre
Salvation Army band.
The arrangements are full of such detail. Slippery-fast melodies give
way to time-marking vamps give way to a Scottish country dance theme,
and Country Dance itself implies a location somewhere in the Argentine
interior. Daybreak and Trapped, more conventional pieces of compact
modern jazz, may have persuaded the organisers, if not Glasgow, that
this is late-night music. It's not, and good though this performance was
and ideal though the Citzs' ambience proved, it might have been even
better in more populous surroundings.

AFTER their manic appearances earlier in the night in Tartuffe, Liz
Lochhead and Michael Marra take to the stage in mellower mood. Marra
flounces around in drag and police uniform in Lochhead's play, but he's
now perched in front of the piano in casual attire. With Lochhead
sitting snugly in an armchair, there is little showmanship about their
late-night cabaret; the effect is relaxed and informal, creating a
feel-good intimacy with their audience.
Lochhead declares their shared appreciation of Scotland, childhood
memories and, rather unusually, paint, in a casual introduction. They
rattle through various preoccupations, from artists' models to
relationship breakdowns, with Lochhead dissecting the dreadful pain of
losing a childhood best friend and Marra singing passionately about the
agonies of a marital record collection being split down the middle.
The subjects are occasionally linked with off-hand remarks but more
usually there's barely a pause between Lochhead's recitations of her
poems and Marra's wry songs; there's a surprising lack of banter between
these two firm friends, a welcome emphasis on the material performed
rather than the personalities performing. The humour is gentle but laced
with sly bite, Lochhead conceals cyanide capsules beneath her more
saccharine rhymes and her magnificent verses of a bride's reflection on
her wedding day consistently undercuts the romance it celebrates, while
Marra is a master of cultural subterfuge, parodying Scottish
sentimenality with merciless efficiency.

BLEAK and black are the songs of bluesmeister Kurt Weill, and bleak
was the setting of the compilation of his songs at the Cottier's
late-night show on Thursday. The stage was bare, except for a couple of
chairs, a table, and the two performers -- singer Phillida Bannister and
guitarist Alpin Smart.
What the set lacked in atmosphere was -- eventually -- made up for by
the evocative nature of the songs. The highly repetitive and unemotional
Alabama Song added little to the ambience, but by the time the duo got
round to The Ballad of Mack the Knife, the mood was charged with menace.
This -- easily the best reading of Weill's much-abused greatest hit
that I've come across -- was a perfect example of the art of musical
storytelling. Not a note was wasted. Every word was crystal clear and
packed with emotion and irony as Bannister gently swayed from side to
side, creating the impression of a lullaby (and its sense of security)
while she sang of murder. The result was maximum dramatic impact.
The same menace was evident in the desperate-sounding Barbara's Song,
sung in German -- and therefore incomprehensible lyricwise, except to
those with their Berlitz books handy -- but spine-chillingly expressive
nevertheless. .
The rest of the show was almost as good: the haunting Bilbao Song; the
moving, and very theatrical Je Ne T'Aime Pas (all languages catered
for), the world-weary couldn't-care-less-ness of On Suicide and -- at
the midnight hour -- the bewitching Surabaya Johnny. The trump card --
an exquisite September Song -- was saved for a well-deserved encore.

MIDSUMMER Night's Dream ends with Puck craving our indulgence, and
well he should. Shakespeare's play gets sillier with each visit, and
Benjamin Britten's operatic treatment does little to improve it. Sitting
through the more than three hours of this English Natioal Opera
production, with its acres of lurid green sets and uninspiring singing,
required patience indeed.
No, that's not quite fair. Director Robert Carsen, and designer
Michael Levine produced a Dream that is visually arresting, with a
steeply raked stage, strong colours and a squadron of technically
ambitious flying beds.
The ramp circling the orchestra pit, and Puck -- the wonderfully manic
actor Emil Wolk -- who pops up behind the conductor and disappears by
diving into one of the stalls boxes, make for some diverting stage work.
Even the singing has some magic in it. The counter-tenor Christopher
Robson is a world-weary Oberon. Lillian Watson is a convincing Tytania.
So why is this production so distinctly un-dreamy?
On opening night the overriding impression was of an under-rehearsed
production -- lots of potentially great elements which had simply not
been given the time to come together.
The technical delays were just a symptom. The blue void at the back of
the stage swallowed up the voices: the singing was often lovely, but too
distant and unintelligible to be truly engaging.
Half the problem, I think, is with Britten. His score doesn't pick up
till the second half, when it captures far more of the play's whimsical,
fairy quality.
That and an excellently staged Pyramus and Thisbe by the rude
mechanicals, gives grounds to hope that by mid-run ENO will have a
solid, though not smashing, success on its hands.

*THIS year's recipient of The Herald's Spirit of Mayfest Award is the
Cottier Theatre. The award demonstrates our continuing commitment to
Mayfest and celebrates exponent of increased access to the arts. While
previous award-winners have been organisations, including the Traverse
Theatre Company last year, 7:84 in '93 and Clyde Unity Theatre in '90,
there are precedents for a venue being named Spirit of Mayfest. The
Arches Theatre scooped the honours in '91 for an ambitious appearance on
the Mayfest scene and the following year the Mercat Theatre in
Drumchapel won the prize for successful and eclectic programming.
From the opening of Mayfest the Cottier, formerly a church, emerged as
a strong contender, its potential was soon confirmed as it hosted a
diverse and lively mix of high-quality work including Cartoon Sardines
Theatre's Le Malade Imagine, Music Theatre Lab's Marry Me A Little, and
Castlemilk People's Theatre's A Climbing Boy. The Herald arts team, who
decide the award, were particularly impressed by the music theatre
programme.
Accepting a cheque for the #500 prize money, Oliver Thomson, chairman
of the Four Acres Charitable Trust who administer the building, said:
''We are extremely pleased to have this prestigious award which is a
tribute to the hard work of Sandy Maxwell and his team.''
In turn Maxwell, the theatre manager, praised the work of the many
volunteers whose commitment ensured the smooth running of their hectic
Mayfest programme. ''The Cottier Theatre has now established itself as
an important name on the Glasgow arts scene,'' he noted happily.

Some others blew hot and cold over certain Mayfest productions at the
Cottier Theatre but, for MICHAEL TUMELTY, the venue itself has a certain
kind of magic
IT'S still pretty rundown and ramshackle of appearance. Seating and
heating are rudimentary. With the latter, if you choose the wrong spot
you'll be directly under what looks like a high-strung electric fire --
and you'll fry. Choose another wrong spot and you'll be in between two
of them and freeze. But it is undeniable that there is an atmosphere,
and some magical ingredient, in the setting of the Cottier Theatre that
transcends these shortcomings.
This Mayfest, the Cottier has come of age. It has housed a number of
varied musical adventures, all of which have found it an accommodating
space. I think the format adopted for straight presentation of chamber
music tweaked -- the RSNO Allander Ensemble stuck up on the middle of
the centre-floor stage looked a bit stark; a more intimate setting, I
feel, exists within the place.
But the true potential of the Cottier lies in music theatre, opera, or
-- largely yet untried -- the increasingly interesting conceptual
approach to programme presentation being explored by some of Scotland's
leading music ensembles.
Critical views on the actual performances during Mayfest of Music
Theatre Lab's Sondheim evening -- Marry Me a Little -- couldn't have
been more divergent. Only the most perverse minds, however, could have
ignored the theatrical intimacy that wouldn't have worked to the same
degree in one of the city's more formal venues.
The most startling experience, of course, was Opera on a Shoestring's
presentation of La Traviata. The young company has played the Cottier
before, with one of their straight-down-the-line compilations of
operatic hits. Scottish Opera significantly chose the venue for the
opening night of their similarly-designed small scale Scottish tour.
The full-scale staging of Traviata, in the middle of the floor with
the audience surrounding the company, was an audacious and thrilling
piece of theatre. Seldom has a Traviata -- in any theatre -- had the
sense of bustle and jostle, upon which its crowd scenes not only thrive
but depend; seldom -- at the other extreme -- have the more intimate
moments had such an immediacy and intensity. Opera in yer face, I called
it at the time.
What it all alerts one to is the theatrical potential of the place
itself. And this is where the untried enters the equation. In recent
years some of the country's leading companies -- the Paragon Ensemble,
the Chamber Group of Scotland (which also appeared at the Cottier during
Mayfest), the choir Cappella Nova, and the Scottish Early Music Consort
-- have all demonstrated a leaning towards conceptual and theatrical
productions, towards a choice of venues where the intrinsic atmosphere
and setting of the place itself becomes an integral part of the
performance. It will be interesting to see what transpires if these
companies can be persuaded to explore the potential of the Cottier.

THe Cottier may have gotten off to a bad start, but, thanks to a
series of improvements, it's got a bright future as a multi-purpose
venue of tomorrow, believes SARA VILLIERS
THE Cottier Theatre's attempts to link up with Mayfest did not have an
auspicious beginning. Last year, the plans to include it as one of the
main festival venues came unstuck at the eleventh hour, with the Four
Acre Charitable Trust, which is in charge of the converted church, only
securing the necessary full-time theatre licence at the end of April.
The staff, particularly the hard-working, long-suffering theatre
manager, Sandy Maxwell, were disappointed but stoically went ahead with
their own fringe programme, with a visit from the lively young
English-based company Ridiculsmus bringing a double-bill of The Third
Policeman and Three Men In A Boat.
Things couldn't be more different this year. The Cottier Theatre was
firmly established as a new and major venue in the Mayfest programme and
the union has been described by Paul Bassett, artistic director of the
festival, as ''one of the most succcessful examples of the kind of
collaboration we are trying to achieve''. It is a collaboration which
has extended to practical support, with Mayfest loaning technical
equipment to the Cottier.
Equipment necessary for the professional functioning of the theatre
has gradually been put in place, recently boosted by lottery funding.
The Cottier Theatre was one of the first beneficiaries of the Scottish
Arts Council's distribution of lottery money, with an award of #9500
enabling it to buy a lighting rig. Its next priority is improving the
heating of the vast, vaulted space, replacing the temporary system now
in operation.
Those who've grumbled about the springtime chill would probably not
complain if they had visited the theatre back in November 1991, when
Test Department staged The Soul Machine. Sitting somewhat painfully on a
thin wooden pew, my teeth chattering away to the rythmns of the house
music accompanying the performance piece, I couldn't believe that this
delapitated, veritable torture chamber of a building could have any
feasible future.
Over the past few years, as slow but steady improvements have been
made, I changed my mind. Cottier has been an atmospheric venue for shows
by the Scottish Youth Theatre and a popular choice of television
companies, with BBC Scotland filming their No Stilettos series there.
The venue has not only provided Glasgow's West Enders with somewhere
to wine and dine -- the bar is chock-a-block at the weekends -- and
given culture vultures a handy joint to flock to, it has also offered
locals the chance to purchase tickets for venues elsewhere in the city,
with the trial installation of a ticketlink computer terminal throughout
April and May. That will probably prove too expensive to maintain in the
near future but Sandy Maxwell hopes that it will eventually become a
permanent feature of what he describes as ''a multi-purpose venue of
tomorrow.'' And so say all of us.

A SOCIAL work investigation into claims that an alleged sex offender
was moved into a council house near the family of a three-year-old who
was thought to have been abused has found that communications between
social workers could be improved.
The inquiry took place after an Uddingston family saw the man they had
accused of child abuse in a local street.
The man was originally charged in 1992 with indecently assaulting the
child. He made no plea when he appeared on petition at Hamilton Sheriff
Court but, as part of his bail conditions, he was told to remain an
in-patient at Hartwood Hospital, near Shotts.
The authorities did not proceed with the case and the man was never
proved guilty or innocent. It is believed there was not enough evidence.
In 1993, he was discharged from the hospital, and social workers
helped to place him in homeless accommodation in Motherwell. He later
left the unit and was put in an Uddingston council house by Motherwell
District Council.
The family, which was not told that the man had been discharged from
hospital, is furious that council officials placed him in a house just
half- a-mile from their own home.
They realised he was living in the neighbourhood only when the alleged
victim's older sister bumped into the man at the local shops.
The girl had been terrified, said her mother, and the nightmare
memories of the original ordeal had been brought flooding back.
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde social services department said that the
district manager had looked into the incident and admitted there should
have been better communications between hospital social workers and
their colleagues in the community. That way, the family might have been
told that the man was out of hospital.
However, she emphasised that the department had not housed the man
close to the family.
She said: ''Our involvement has always been with the family and not
with the man. He was helped to find accommodation in a Lanarkshire town
and then later moved to a council house near the family.
''He was never tried or convicted, so it is a sensitive situation. But
the district manager has taken a look at the case and may take some
measures to improve communication.
''We are continuing to support the family as best we can -- these are
always difficult situations to deal with.''

THE proposed Rolls-Royce factory closure in East Kilbride will cost
Strathclyde more than 260 job losses on top of the 636 being made
redundant, economists have estimated.
The impact of the closure of the Rolls-Royce aero-engine design
facility has been investigated by the Fraser of Allander Institute at
Strathclyde University. It used computer modelling to come up with the
estimate that the final job loss figure could eventually be more than
900.
It takes into account the knock-on effect of so many well-paid jobs
being lost to the area, and the subsequent cuts in other industries as
the loss of money in the local economy makes an impact.
Across Strathclyde, it is estimated that the closure will also mean
#15m being taken out of the economy.
Councillor Colin Robb, leader of East Kilbride District Council, which
commissioned the study, described the figures as devastating.
''The council is naturally deeply concerned over the loss of
high-quality jobs to the local economy and the wider effect this has on
the community and local business. But more so because the closure seems
so unnecessary when East Kilbride has proved its efficiency over the
past several years,'' he said.
The council is backing the workforce's attempts to try to reverse the
closure decision.

BY anyone's standards, John Mayall has paid his musical dues. The
godfather of the British Blues boom of the sixties and early seventies,
he discovered and, through his Bluesbreakers' line-ups, provided a
showcase for the talents of Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor, Mick
Fleetwood, John McVie, and many more.
And while his guitarists went on to pick up the plaudits, John kept
moving on; forming new bands, making a record, touring, always touring.
''It's about 20 years since I was here last,'' says John when the band
take the stage. ''Now we're going to make up for lost time.''
At 61, he's in remarkably good shape and is obviously enjoying the
opening trade of licks between keyboard, harmonica, and guitar.
Spinning Coin, the title song from the latest album -- widely regarded
as his best in many years -- got the show on the road. Nature's
Disappearing proved environmentally friendly as the crowd warm to the
band. But Superstition and the classic All Your Lovin' give Texan
guitarist Buddy Wittington room to manoeuvre, and suddenly John is
coaxing and cajoling him into a series of free-flowing yet gut-wrenching
solos.
Once he'd zipped up his guitar, he simply burned the place down.
A rollicking Room to Move rounded off the 100-minute set before the
obilgatory encore.
Back in the Sixties, Mayall released an album featuring the then
unknown guitarist Peter Green. Much like tonight, the songs on A Hard
Road had a raw,  edge to them, and the solos cut to the bone.
Almost 30 years on, we should all be thankful that John is still on
that road.

THE self-styled Laird of Tomintoul may have been a perfect gent, but
his theft stole something irreplaceable from the man he headhunted to
run his enterprises.
David Abdy, 27, missed eight precious months in the life of his baby
daughter, who had to stay in America with her mother while he sorted out
the mess ''in which I had been dropped''.
''You have to make sacrifices in life to survive, and that was the
sacrifice I had to make,'' said Mr Abdy.
''When it hit the fan and Tony Williams was arrested, my wife Jodi and
baby Ashley, who was nine months, were in America visiting Jodi's mum. I
had to phone and tell Jodi that she had better stay there.
''She had to work to support them, because I was unable to draw a
salary for eight months. All I could do was take enough money to live.''
By sheer coincidence, yesterday, as Williams was beginning his
seven-and-a-half year jail sentence, Mr Abdy was signing the papers
which will allow him to run the Gordon Arms Hotel and Clockhouse
Restaurant on a proper footing.
David Abdy was restaurant manager at the Craigendarroch Country Club
when he was approached by Williams.
Mr Abdy, 27, who had experience in London and America, agreed to go to
Tomintoul to try to transform the fortunes of the loss-making Clockhouse
Restaurant which Williams owned.
Williams subsequently bought the hotel and asked him to take care of
it as well.
After refurbishment, the hotel re-opened in May last year but little
more than two months later, Williams was arrested and Mr Abdy's world
collapsed around him.
''I had dealt with restaurants with problems before, but I had never
tackled anything on this scale. It has been a very difficult time and
very hard work for me and for the members of staff but nothing comes
easy in this life. There have always got to be sacrifices.''
The sacrifices look like paying off for Mr Abdy, who had been made a
director of Williams' company Tomintoul Enterprises Ltd (TEL), which was
left with debts of more than #200,000.
Yesterday the final documentation was completed on the deal, which is
backed by the National Westminster Bank.
''We have possibly survived the worst time,'' Mr Abdy said. ''A lot of
people didn't envisage we would last three weeks, but we have survived
the winter in Tomintoul, which is not a lot of fun from a business point
of view.''
Mr Abdy, from Sheffield, is enjoying life in Tomintoul, which he says
is ''away from all the nonsense and somewhere you can get on with
business''.
''I don't want to sound cold, but it doesn't really interest me what
happens to Tony Williams as long as it doesn't affect our situation.
''I didn't know him as the character who has now emerged. I probably
only met him about 20 times, but to me he was a perfect gentleman.
''He appeared to be someone with money. In the hotel business, you
meet a lot of ten-bob millionaires, and he didn't appear to be one of
them. He was quiet and not flash.
''He was very down to earth, and although he could play the part of
Lord Williams very well if he wanted, he was really quite quiet and you
could have knocked me off my seat when he was arrested.''

HOTLY tipped for pop's toppermost by the more febrile sections of the
British music press, Supergrass last night revealed themselves to be a
retro-mod power trio who actually have only two types of song at this
very early stage of their career. They've got frantic, music-hall punk
ones with helium-derived falsetto harmonies from the bassist, and
they've got slower ones which have rather more light and shade to them.
There is more promise in the songs which fall into the second
category, most notably Alright -- which has correctly been hailed as an
anthemic My Generation for Generation Y -- and Time. Both of them have a
pleasing and insouciant swagger, and they'll soon be issued as
Supergrass's next single, a double A-sider. So announced fuzzy-faced
teenage vocalist and axe-hero Gaz. Double A-sider? Isn't this supposed
to be the CD era?
Young 'uns today don't think so. Our Gaz plainly derives his
inspiration from bygone discs of yore. Bowie when everything was Hunky
Dory in an Anthony Newley kind of way. Syd Barrett, the original
laughing madcap. Small Faces; Cheap Trick; the Jam; the Buzzcocks.
Of course, these are all good places from which to begin, and
Supergrass wield their influences with likeable zest and fey charm. But,
but, but . . . when they do a brand-new one that isn't on their debut
album, I Should Coco, it unfortunately resembles a fluffier and less
driven version of Steppenwolf's Born To Be Wild; Born To Be Mild anyone?
So while Supergrass are gutsier than Suede and pithier than Blur,
they're not yet quite as essential as any of the rockney geezers who
first passed along the same trail in 1972.

IMAGES of Africa pulse through Kevin Volans' Fifth String Quartet. Out
of a fast, edgy swoop of strings, a child's laugh will chuckle on the
take. Women's voices, the clatter of pans, a hot silence pierced by
chirruping insects or a singing bird . . . These are the textures that
suggest the African location for Siobhan Davies' new piece Wild
Translation.
Overhead, a lazy silver propellor fans a lattice of light and shade
across the stage. A pool of bright light underneath suggests a watering
hole. On either side, dancers loll as if pinned down by heat. It's a
calm lethargy that splits into sudden, sharp flurries of movement as the
music explodes into a rapid shower of sound. Already the atmospheric
contrasts of the piece are flagged up.
As the stage is variously flooded by white light, dappled shade,
intense darkness it's as if the seven dancers are reacting to these
alterations in their environment. At times, there's an almost
animalistic response: a nudging, nuzzling gesture of welcome, the
agitated jittering of folded wings. Nothing overstated, just hints to
remind us of our natural context.
When it comes to human instincts, Davies quite simply excels in
translating what is internal into an external language of lyrical
clarity and beauty. Whatever heat, whatever breathing darkness Wild
Translation takes out of Africa, the people in Davies' dance are all of
us.
As with The Glass Blew In -- even more sumptuous and enthralling than
before -- this new piece is, essentially, a celebration of human spirit
channelled through bodies. Davies is fortunate, or perhaps it's simply
because she is such an exceptional choreographer, that dancers of mental
as well as physical maturity appear in her work.
There's nothing acted up in any of this, just an intelligent pointing
of the deeper levels Davies meshes into her work.

THE public services union, Unison, yesterday warned Scottish council
leaders that it wanted to reopen pay negotiations for its 100,000
members in local government.
Officials said that the current rate of inflation, more than 3%, was
running ahead of the 2% increase for 1995 which was agreed last year as
part of a two-year settlement.
Mr Mark Irvine, the union's head of local government, said Unison had
opposed an extended pay deal, and now intended to invoke a ''re-opener''
clause for further negotiations.
Speaking on the eve of the union's Scottish conference, being held in
Edinburgh today, he said: ''We warned the employers last year that their
insistence on an extended pay deal could backfire.
''It represented an enormous gamble, and our worst fears are now
coming true: inflation is taking off and all experts predict it will
continue to rise.
''Our members in local government are being made the scapegoats for
the mess the Tories have made of the economy. Public spending is being
held down in a cynical effort to finance Tory tax cuts.''
Mr Irvine urged members to support the Unison campaign for new pay
talks, and said councils could face industrial action if they failed to
respond positively to the union's demand.
Meanwhile, a row over a controversial move by the new shadow
single-tiercouncil for Argyll and Bute to check on the ''attitude'' of
staff before re-employing them has escalated.
Unison has warned the council that it will use ''all the methods open
to us to defend members' jobs and conditions''.
The row broke out when the ruling Independent group on the new council
decided that the transfer scheme for about 5000 staff currently employed
in its area should take account of their ''attitude, commitment, and
attendance''.
Opposition councillors condemned the move as ''sinister'' and
''anti-trade union'' but found themselves out-voted by 21-10.
The employees currently work for Argyll and Bute District Council,
Strathclyde Regional Council, and Dumbarton District Council.
The Scottish secretary of Unison, Mr Matt Smith, has now warned the
council not to ''cherry-pick'' staff.
He said: ''Our members didn't seek this reorganisation, and we are not
going to allow them to pay for it with their jobs, pay, or conditions.
All existing staff who want to continue working in Scottish local
government must be transferred to the appropriate new authority with no
detriment to their working conditions.''
Mr Smith recognised that many councils were in discussion with the
union to smooth the process towards change-over, but he issued a warning
to what Unison has termed ''rogue'' councils.
Councillor John Wilson, the council convener, said yesterday that the
controversial clause in the transfer scheme had been put forward by the
Independent group leader, Councillor Dick Walsh.
''There was certainly no intention of picking on anyone or any part of
the staff -- he just felt it was a safeguard for us,'' Mr Wilson said.

The Scottish Home Affairs Minister, Lord Fraser,
, yesterday tried to reassure senior police officers following the
sweeping indictment of Government policing policy earlier this week by
Strathclyde's chief constable, Mr Leslie Sharp.
However following the Minister's address to the Scottish Police
Superintendents' Association conference at Peebles, Mr Sharp immediately
accused him of failing to address the real issues.
The chief constable welcomed an assurance from Lord Fraser that
''nothing would come over Hadrian's Wall without full consultation'' but
then stated that the Minister had missed the point over the changes.
Despite Lord Fraser's emollient tone, Mr Sharp said the Minister was
saying nothing new.
He referred to one of his main points of criticism, the growth of
private security as a substitute for policing, allied to the current
review of police core functions, which Mr Sharp believes is a device to
privatise some police tasks to save money. On this, he said, it missed
the point for Lord Fraser to say he did not want anyone else to assume
the powers of constable.
''We say that there are a whole range of jobs done by the police as
routine which do not need police powers. We do them because it means the
support of the public and that helps us to do those jobs for which we do
need police powers. You cannot just divorce the two.
''I believe you cannot do the core tasks properly unless you do the
ancillary tasks and I do not think Lord Fraser addressed that point
today.''
Mr Sharp rejected the statement that policing was expensive. He had
calculated that in Strathclyde it cost everyone 32p per day and were all
these individuals asked if they were prepared to pay another 10p for
better policing then ''I think they would take your arm off''.
He continued: ''All the Government's suggested measures are
cost-cutting under the guise that policing is a business. But you drag
the police service into the business world at your peril because you
will lose the service ethic.
''Lord Fraser made a direct response to me in his address, looking me
straight in the eye and saying he did not know and had never known a
chief constable who would bow the knee to political or any other
pressure.
''I want to look him in the eye and ask him if he could be sure he did
not know any chief constable who might bow the knee for more money, say
7.5% in performance-related pay. That is the distance between us.''
After offering reassurance to the superintendents on issues such as
abolition of the chief superintendent rank, fixed-term appointments and
appraisal-related pay, Lord Fraser referred directly to Mr Sharp's
lecture in which he had, he said, raised concerns which would be shared
by many of those present.
''I hope I can reassure him and you that beyond a number of ancillary
adjustments which I suspect at the end of the day he might welcome I
have no intention whatever of handing over the tasks of the constable to
private security or to introduce some new tier of state-supported
vigilantes.''
Lord Fraser emphasised that compulsory competitive tendering, now
spreading to some aspects of police service maintenance, was a
fundamental part of the Government's policy of improving efficiency in
all the public services.
Extension of CCT to the police was being considered seperately from
other local government services and they were taking police advice in
framing the proposals.
The Minister took a veiled swipe at Mr Sharp's stance in favour of a
single police force for all of Scotland when he said he wished to
highlight one change that would not take place.
''The number of police forces in Scotland will not alter. With the
opportunity of local government reform many people suggested the
Government would alter force boundaries or even create a national police
force. But the people of Scotland place great importance on their local
police forces which is a tribute to your members and the rest of the
service,'' he said.

''LORD'' Tony Williams arrived in the Highland village of Tomintoul
like a breath of fresh air, with a seemingly endless supply of money to
invest in the community.
However, he took the villagers' breath away when it became clear that
the money he was using was as a result of a major crime, not, as it
should have been, for combating organised crime.
To his colleagues in the Metropolitan Police, he was a respected
accountant, albeit with a comfortable lifestyle in south- west London.
At the other end of the country, in one of the highest and most
picturesque villages in the land, he was the fancy-talking lord with
more money than sense.
''Lord Williams'', who had bought several properties in the struggling
village, who paid for the police pipe bands at the Tomintoul Games, and
whose wife opened the local fete, was warmly welcomed by the village
most commonly in the news because, at the first hint of winter, it is
snowbound.
Tomintoul was ready for some good news. Dalwhinnie had deposed it as
Scotland's highest village, salmon fishing -- an international tourist
draw -- was in decline, and a lack of snow was causing a shortage of
skiers.
Then, over the horizon appeared Tony Williams, 45, and his wife Kay.
Mr Williams was the owner of the title to the Barony of Chirnside and
Whitehall in Berwickshire, but his heart was in the Highlands, not in
the Borders, and that was where he was to sink his ill-gotten gains.
Williams, a deputy establishment officer with the Metropolitan Police,
had spent the equivalent of more than two years salary on his barony
title at an auction in London, but his love affair with Tomintoul
started during a holiday in Scotland.
Williams, who, before he started siphoning huge amounts of money from
police funds intended to support undercover operations, had been
stealing from a civilian staff welfare fund under his control, owned a
timeshare in Ballater.
His lodge was at the Craigendarroch complex, whose facilities the
royal family have frequently used during their holidays at Balmoral,
and, during a stay there, Williams and his wife visited Tomintoul and
were captivated.
Williams' first purchase in the village was Mallory Cottage, which he
bought for #7000 in 1987 and promptly spent 20 times that amount
restoring it. Even the new kitchen cost more than three times the price
of the house.
His first commercial venture was the purchase of the Clockhouse
Restaurant and, although it quickly became clear that nothing but the
best was good enough for Lord Tony, the villagers were surprised when he
spent around #500,000 on the premises, even providing its own bakery,
before it opened as a French-style bistro in 1989.
But even silly money could not buy success and it was a loss-maker.
Not that Williams seemed particularly concerned.
However, he persuaded David Abdy, who has established a reputation in
reversing the fortunes of problematic restaurants, to quit the
Craigendarroch and run the Clockhouse.
He forced it into profit while Williams continued to spend, spend,
spend around the village.
He bought an empty bus garage and an adjoining bungalow and then spent
#120,000 more than he need have paid to become owner of the ailing
Gordon Arms Hotel.
Williams then spent around #1.8m of the Metropolitan Police's money
renovating the 29-bedroom hotel and public bar, the Grouse's Nest.
His other purchases in Tomintoul included the former fire station and
the Old Manse of Creggan, a beautiful three-storey building and former
home of the Free Church minister who served the Glenlivet area.
Williams, who also bought a #200,000 villa on the Costa del Sol, had
intended to retire to the manse with its huge gardens. However his
surroundings for the next few years will be somewhat more austere, and
the house was recently sold off for around #150,000.
A glance at the wall of the study in the old manse gives an insight
into the mind of the man who embarrassed the Metropolitan Police by the
enormity of the fraud he carried out under their noses.
The hangings include a photograph of Sir Winston Churchill, and pride
of place alongside it goes to the certificate which was presented to him
by the then Commissioner Sir Peter Imbert in 1991 at the height of his
undetected crimes for 22 years of ''long and meritorious service''.
However the cheek of the man is reflected by the fact that also on the
wall, and by an unknown artist, hangs a cartoon showing a kilted Lord
Williams in a jersey with a ''#'' motif and wearing a ''Loadsamoney''
badge.
As a security van heads towards him, the caption says: ''Och, it will
be the Special Branch from London wanting Tony to open his sporran.''
But Williams, the respected police accountant, lived in a relatively
modest #200,000 detached house in New Malden in the heart of suburban
Surrey.
It was there he was arrested after the Clydesdale Bank in Tomintoul,
suspicious of cheques going through the account of Lord and Lady
Williams -- the names on their gold credit cards -- notified the
Metropolitan Police Fraud Squad.
But Williams will long be remembered in Tomintoul, and the memories
will be fond in spite of the fact his business activities were made
possible by the theft of #5m.
Last night they toasted him in a beer specially brewed in the village
called ''Laird of Tomintoul'' -- the label contains a Metropolitan
Police helmet.
Williams is regarded as a modern-day Robin Hood in the small community
and local shopkeeper Ian Birnie said yesterday he would be welcome back
any time.
''Maybe he will come back himself to retire here after his sentence.
We'll be waiting to welcome him.
''It was only Government money anyway. It is as well spent in
Tomintoul as anywhere else. If it hadn't been spent, the village would
have been left with only one hotel.''
Mr John Abdy, father of restaurant boss David, echoed these
sentiments.
''He was a latter-day Robin Hood,'' said Mr Abdy, who moved to
Tomintoul where he bought a shop and post office.
''He didn't do anyone any harm,'' he said. ''He was quite a quiet
fellow and I am certain he was bit of a romantic. He changed things and
Tomintoul for the better. He certainly seemed to have money and was no
'Del Boy' type.''
His son David painted a similar picture: ''The image he portrayed was
that of a lord. He had a job at Scotland Yard which was a secret job and
he didn't really speak about it much.
''I didn't have the impression he was doing his job for the sake of
work -- he felt it was a public responsibility.
''I thought he was public school. He knew how to speak and how to
present himself. He was distinguished-looking, with gold-rimmed glasses
and hair going grey at the temples.
''Kay was very much a lady -- attractive, slim, mature and very
caring. They were very quiet and kept themselves to themselves.''
The Rev Sven Bjarnason, the local Church of Scotland minister, was
also supportive of Mr Williams, and said that the media impression of
him lording around the Highlands was far from the truth, and some good
might well come of his crime.
''He did good things and it's far too early to say what his legacy
will be,'' he said.
Woodcarver Donald Corr said: ''In the long term, he saved a couple of
buildings which were falling down and becoming eyesores. That's the only
legacy, apart from giving everyone something to talk about in the pub.
''I wouldn't say now that there was any bitterness. At the time people
did worry, because he was buying the whole village.
''If you have that sort of loot to splash about and you put it in one
little village it becomes obvious.
''It was like a guy playing Monopoly -- but it was real houses and
real money.
''He landed on the square that said ''Go To Jail.' The mystery is how
he thought he would get away with it.
''Now that the stooshie has died down, Tomintoul goes on much the
same.'' Mr Corr has made his own contribution to the memory of Lord
Williams in Tomintoul by way of a poem which shares the name of the beer
''The Laird of Tomintoul'' and which accurately reflects the villagers
feelings about him.
A touch of poetic justice
''Lord'' Williams came to Tomintoul
The natives thought him posh.
He bought up half the village
With loads and loads of dosh.
He opened sales of work and such
As befits a local nob
And, according to the papers,
He created every job.
And now the grateful natives,
Showing their proper attitude,
On seeing their noble nobbled,
Have expressed their gratitude.
He has not got a statue,
Nor a plaque fixed to the wall.
Nor after him have they renamed
The local village hall.
But the Brewery at Tomintoul
Has brewed a brand new ale
''The Laird of Tomintoul'' it's called
And it's newly out on bail.
Although it's slightly bitter
(Like many folk up here)
You'll like 'The Laird of Tomintoul'
An honest, wholesome beer.''

POLICE investigating the case of an elderly hospital patient found
with low blood sugar levels after receiving an ''inappropriate'' dose of
insulin yesterday said it was still unclear whether a crime had been
committed.
Detectives were called in when the case came to light at Grantham and
District Hospital, former workplace of child killer Beverly Allitt, who
killed some of her victims with an insulin overdose.
The police investigation was launched after hospital managers carried
out an internal inquiry.
Howeer, a spokesman for Lincolnshire police said it would be wrong to
jump to conclusions at this stage.
A statement from Grantham NHS Trust chief executive Paul Roberts
confirmed that an elderly patient was recently found to have ''very low
blood sugar in circumstances which are unexplained''.
Mr Roberts added: ''Expert advice indicates that the patient received
an inappropriate dose of insulin.''
Allitt, 26, was given 13 life sentences for murdering four children,
attempting to kill three others and causing grievous bodily harm to a
further six at the hospital, formerly called Grantham and Kesteven
Hospital,in 1991.
The Clothier report into the killings, published in February 1994,
said some of Allitt's victims might have been saved had vital clues not
been overlooked by doctors, nurses and managers.
Sir Cecil Clothier criticised ''indecisive'' senior managers and a
''lack of leadership, energy and drive''.
The police spokesman indicated that the hospital authorities were
taking no chances after what happened in the Allitt case.
Insulin is used to treat diabetes sufferers because their blood/sugar
level cannot be regulated.
One expert said that it can be extremely difficult to stabilise
levels. She added that very high or very low readings are not unusual
and do not necessarily indicate negligence as a patient may not have
eaten much.

LABOUR has not made a deal with the unions to delay a decision on the
level of a minimum wage, a leading trade union leader claimed yesterday.
Mr Bill Morris, leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union,
emphasised that, like many other unions, the TUC and indeed the Labour
Party itself, the TGWU had a policy favouring a wage minimum, based on
half male average earnings.
In line with that policy, he would be campaigning for a #4 a hour
minimum, at first through negotiations with employers, but subsequently
an incoming Labour Government would be pressed to give it statutory
backing.
Mr Morris, running for re-election as TGWU general secretary, the
biggest union affiliated to the Labour Party, used the launch of his own
election manifesto to hit out at those commentators who had suggested
that Labour had secured a deal with the unions to defer detailed
consideration of a national minimum wage until after the General
Election.
Although not present at a meeting of the Labour-TUC ''contact'' group
last Monday because of his election campaign, Mr Morris emphasised that
the TUC general secretary, Mr John Monks, had assured him there had been
consultation, but no agreement, on the concept of a special commission
or review body to consider the issue.
Mr Morris's defiant mood will ensure a continuing row with the Labour
leadership until the party conference in October.
It also will give his challenger national secretary, Mr Jack Dromey,
more ammunition for accusations that Mr Morris is undermining Labour's
election hopes even though the top item on Mr Morris's manifesto is a
commitment ''to work flat out for the election of a Labour government''.
Earlier this week, Mr Dromey, husband of Labour's employment
spokeswoman Harriet Harman, launched a bitter attack against the way the
union has been run and said its relations with the Labour Party were at
an ''all-time low''.
Mr Morris hit back at Mr Dromey yesterday, questioning his loyalty to
the union, saying it was ''sad'' that Labour has been dragged into the
election.
Union members would be ''bemused'' at the way Labour had become
involved, Mr Morris said.
Mr Dromey, who was campaigning in Plymouth yesterday, claimed there
had been a sense of ''drift'' in the TGWU and pledged to increase the
910,000 membership to nearer two million by the year 2000.
As nominations closed, more than 720 TGWU branches, representing more
than 150,000 members, nominated Mr Morris, compared with more than 300
branches with about 100,000 members for Mr Dromey.
Mr Ron Todd, the former TGWU general secretary, is supporting Mr
Morris and has denounced Mr Dromey for ''immoral'' use of Tory laws to
challenge a colleague's position while his own is not under threat.
The majority of national and regional secretaries also support Mr
Morris. However, with the vast majority of the union's 7000 branches not
nominating at all and history showing that members do not necessarily
follow the lead of their officials, both camps maintain they are doing
well.
Voting starts within about ten days with the result, which could be
close, due on June 23.
Launching his campaign in Plymouth, Mr Dromey said he had received
nominations from the union's largest branches, from every region and
every trade group.
He said there was a clear mood for change in the country and a mood
for change in the TGWU.

THE hi-tech theft of a highly-protected #215,000 Bentley left the
police and its makers, Rolls-Royce baffled yesterday. The 150mph Bentley
Azure, lent to two British motoring journalists, was stolen from an
underground car park at the Hotel Ambaschitori in Brescia, northern
Italy, on Wednesday night. Somehow the thieves managed to bypass all the
state-of-the-art alarm systems and escape with the 2.3 ton luxury
open-topped tourer.
''The whole thing is a complete mystery and I have never known
anything like it in my 10 years with the company,'' said a Rolls-Royce
spokesman yesterday. ''This must have been a highly professional job. It
certainly was not joyriders. They would have had to cancel out all the
alarms. The car was equipped to detect event the slightest vibration and
it's baffling how the thieves managed to get such a huge vehicle out of
the car park.
''We are in touch with the Italian police but so far there has been no
word about the car.'' The 6.75 litre Azure, launched at the Geneva Motor
Show in March, had been lent to Alan Copps of the Times and Eric Bailey
of the Daily Telegraph.

A ROBBER who fired a handgun at two unarmed policemen as they chased
him after a supermarket raid, was jailed for 18 years yesterday.
At one point, Leonard Kempley tried to fire at Constable Anthony Diver
from point-blank range, but his gun jammed, the Old Bailey was told. He
pulled the trigger twice but it failed to go off.
The Recorder of London, Judge Lawrence Verney, QC, said: ''If it had
not jammed it is appalling to think what might have happened.''
He commended Mr Diver and his colleague Constable David Hall for their
''exemplary courage and calmness'' in chasing Kempley, 39, who had
already fired five times at them while leaning out of the getaway car.
Outside court, Mr Diver, 30, a married man with a baby son, said:
''Guns should be made more readily available to police but I am not in
favour of arming every officer.
''I would carry a gun tomorrow and if I had had one on this occasion I
would have shot him dead.''
The incident had had a profound effect on his life, he said, adding:
''I couldn't sleep for weeks afterwards. It will be with me forever.''
The court heard that police rushed to the scene of the robbery on
Quiksave Supermarket in Marylands Crescent, Dagenham, Essex, on August
18 last year.
Kempley, Terence McGingley, and Frederick Lloyd, 45, were holding
staff hostage trying to open the safe. Both Lloyd and Kempley were
armed. Two employees managed to escape and raise the alarm.
A high-speed chase followed with Kempley leaning out of the getaway
car firing at the pursuing officers. He shot his handgun five times in
all.
The gang abandoned their car and tried to escape on foot and it was
then that Kempley confronted Mr Diver and aimed his handgun at him.
Mr Diver said afterwards: ''I was absolutely terrified. I thought he
was going to kill me.''
The judge told Kempley: ''You had a firearm and used it with intent to
prevent arrest. If that gun had not jammed it is extremely likely you
would have discharged it at the police officer at very close range.''
Lloyd, of Orpington, Kent, was found guilty of two robberies,
attempted robbery and perverting the course of justice and jailed for a
total of 17 years.
Former Paratrooper and Northern Ireland veteran Terence McGinley, 40,
of Beckton, east London, was jailed for 11 years after admitting
attempted robbery and possessing a firearm.
Kempley, of Catford, south London, was found guilty of attempted
robbery and making use of a firearm with intent to avoid arrest. He was
cleared of attempting to murder Mr Diver. Both Lloyd and Kempley had
several previous convictions for robbery and violence.

<TEXT>
A COUNCIL came under fire last night for spending #4000 on a
personalised number plate that no-one can understand.
Members of West Lothian District Council's miscellaneous services
committee had voted overwhelmingly to buy the plate ASX 1.
The plate will go on the council's only official car, a
chauffeur-driven Ford Scorpio used by council chiefs and visiting
dignitaries.
However, the chairman of the committee Mr Frank Anderson -- who voted
against the purchase -- suggested that the new number plate should read
ASS instead of ASX. ''Perhaps ASS 1 might be more appropriate, or mean
more to the public,'' the SNP councillor observed.
''Spending #4000 on a number plate is a complete and utter waste of
money, there are a thousand and one better things that the cash could be
spent on,'' he complained.
He explained that the letters SX have an historical significance for
the district.
''SX used to be the old West Lothian Burgh Council's registration
number back in the days of the old burgh councils.
''But I don't think that has any significance now -- most people won't
know about the history so the letters SX will mean nothing to them.
''I don't think the number will mean anything to the majority of the
people of West Lothian.'
The number plate used to belong to the late John Calder, who was the
clerk of the old county council.
When his family decided to sell the plate they gave West Lothian
District Council first option to buy it.

BUSINESSMAN Owen Oyston was sent for trial yesterday on rape and other
sex charges.
The 61-year-old multi-millionaire chairman of Blackpool Football Club
was committed to Manchester Crown Court together with model agency boss
Mr Peter Martin, 55.
At the end of a five-day hearing, Manchester stipendiary magistrate Mr
Alan Berg ruled that Mr Oyston, of Claughton Hall, near Lancaster, and
Mr Martin, of Northenden Road, Sale, Greater Manchester, should stand
trial on a charge that they conspired together to procure women under 21
for sex with Mr Oyston.
Mr Oyston was also committed for trial on three alleged rapes and two
alleged indecent assaults involving three different women.
However, Mr Berg ruled there was no case to answer on a charge that Mr
Oyston had raped another woman and indecently assaulted two others. He
was discharged on those counts.
Mr Oyston was told his bail of #50,000 could continue and the
magistrate agreed to an application from Mr Anthony Scrivener QC,
defence counsel, that his passport could be returned so he could travel
on business abroad.
Mr Scrivener said Mr Oyston, who is alleged to have conspired with Mr
Martin between April 1, 1988, and the end of February 1994, was
reserving his defence.
The businesman's wife, Vicki, was in court with him throughout the
hearing.
Mr Martin was remanded in custody. He faces separate committal
proceedings later this year on eight alleged rapes, six alleged indecent
assaults, two charges involving indecent photographs and an accusation
that he kept a disorderly house.
His former assistant, Ms Tracey Grainey, 28, from Atherton,
Manchester, was further remanded on bail accused of four indecent
assaults and keeping a disorderly house.
Reporting restrictions remained in force during the hearing.

<HEADLINE>Anger at Mayhew decision to meet Adams during conference. Unionist leaders boycott US talks</HEADLINE>

THE leaders of Ulster's two main Unionist parties have pulled out of
next week's Irish-American investment conference in Washington, because
of the decision by Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew to meet
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams in private talks there.
Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, said he well
understood the fear of Ulster businessmen, that a gathering intended to
concentrate on increasing investment in the province, would not be used
as a backdrop to all manner of political stunts. The Rev Ian Paisley,
the Democratic Unionist Party leader, had also withdrawn.
Mr Molyneaux said that, out of a sense of duty to those who were
primarily interested in securing more foreign investment for Northern
Ireland, he had decided not to attend ''so that political distractions
may be reduced and the emphasis rightly placed on those who will be
engaged in discussions specifically aimed at improving the economy of
Northern Ireland''.
The Unionists are furious that Sir Patrick had agreed to what will be
the first meeting between a Cabinet Minister and Sinn Fein for 70 years
before Sinn Fein have agreed to persuade the IRA to hand over its
arsenals of weapons and bomb-making equipment.
Some observers believe the Government was forced into agreeing the
meeting, amid fears that if it did not, the American administration
might engineer an encounter between Sir Patrick and Mr Adams in any
case.
Ministers now propose to use the meeting to emphasise to Sinn Fein
leaders that they will not be admitted to round-table talks with the
other political parties in the province, until they have shown their
long-term good intentions by surrendering at least some of their stocks
of weapons.
Unionists believe that the IRA should agree to a comprehensive
programme of decommissioning weapons before being admitted to
constitutional talks on the future of the province.
President Clinton is due to address the conference on Thursday and
several Ministers from the Republic of Ireland will attend.
Other prospective Unionist visitors said they did not propose to allow
what they regard as another PR opportunity for Mr Adams to overshadow
the original aims of the conference.
The British Government felt that allowing Sir Patrick and Mr Adams to
meet was necessary to satisfy Americans that the peace process was still
making progress but they will not be engaging in substantive talks.
The meeting, however, will clear the way for a resumption of talks
between Sinn Fein's Mr Martin McGuinness and Northern Ireland Minister
Michael Ancram.
Yesterday British MPs attended the Dublin government's National Forum
for Peace and Reconciliation for the first time.
In a move seen as a further step forward for the continuing Northern
Ireland peace process, Conservative MP, Mr Peter Temple-Morris and
Labour's Mr Roger Stott both spoke at a Dublin Castle session of the
body established last year to pave the way to Sinn Fein's post-IRA
ceasefire entry into mainline politics.
In another historic, peace process-linked development, members of Sinn
Fein entered the main chamber of the Dail -- the Irish parliament -- for
the first time since Irish independence, to make a submission to a
committee on the Irish language.
Watched by both Sinn Fein delegates and Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton, Mr Temple-Morris -- at the forum as a representative of the
British-Irish Parliamentary Body -- described the achievement of peace
in Northern Ireland as ''the most important thing in my political
life''.
He said everyone was now engaged in ''a major act of reconciliation
upon the island of Ireland as a whole, and between our two countries.
''No longer can two of the closest, and indeed considered among the
more civilised of nations, tolerate for themselves and towards the
outside world, the agonies of violence and death, when we are surely
capable of living together in peace.''
The forum session debated north-south structures in Ireland in the
light of the joint British and Irish framework document for political
progress in Northern Ireland, issued earlier this year.

<RECORDNO>978305313</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE health and travel insurance markets are to be investigated by the
Office of Fair Trading, it was announced yesterday.
Lack of information for consumers ''raised concerns that they were not
getting value for money,'' said Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT
director-general.
''The health insurance market has rapidly grown to its current value
of around #1500m and there are now many products, from critical illness
cover to long-term care insurance, on offer,'' he said.
The OFT inquiry will examine whether contracts have unfair or obscure
clauses or exclusions and whether consumers are receiving the kind of
payouts they expect or might be expected from the policies they have
been sold, Sir Bryan said.
He continued: ''There is scope for mis-selling in this growing
industry and we will be asking whether consumers are getting value for
money and the appropriate products for their needs.''
Sir Bryan said travel insurance was less spectacular in terms of
recent and potential growth but it was still an important market with an
estimated #400m a year turnover.
He added: ''Our initial work has revealed several potential consumer
problems. Many travel insurance policies are sold only on a 'tied-in'
basis where the consumer must buy a specified insurance policy to get a
particular holiday package or a discount on such a package.
''Even when there is no formal tying-in of insurance relatively few
travel agents offer a choice of insurer.''
OFT officials have already had discussions with the Association of
British Insurers and the Association of British Travel Agents to seek
views on consumer problems and they soon will be meeting the Consumers'
Association.
* Travel agent Lunn Poly yesterday cut #100 from the price of many
June holidays.
The discount applies for trips booked from any Thomson, Horizon, or
Skytours brochure. Bookings must be made between May 20 and June 3.
The reduction is available on a wide range of holidays including
popular Mediterranean resorts as well as long-haul destinations such as
the Caribbean.
The announcement suggests there are still many last-minute summer
bargains available.
Bookings have been quite sluggish, although earlier this week Lunn
Poly forecast a record ten million people would take an overseas package
this summer.

GEORGE BEATTIE, the man at the centre of Scotland's most controversial
murder case, has parted company with Mr Joe Beltrami, the Glasgow
solicitor who has represented him for the past eight years.
Mr Beltrami told The Herald that he supported his former client's
decision and in no way felt bitter about what had happened.
He emphasised that there had been no fall-out with Beattie and
promised that, if asked, he would offer any assistance he could to
Beattie's new counsel.
Mr Beltrami said yesterday: ''George wrote a nice letter to me about
two weeks ago saying that he wanted a fresh face involved in the case
and wanted to instruct someone else.
''I think perhaps the case does need a fresh face and a fresh outlook
and I gave all the papers to George's brother who came into the office
yesterday.
''I think there's a lot of sense behind this. I've been involved for
eight years and if I can be of any assistance with the matter of new
evidence I will be only too pleased to do that.''
Mr Beltrami admits that his long involvement in the case has made him
'possibly biased,' but has always been, and still is convinced of
Beattie's innocence.
Beattie, a former steelworker, was jailed for life 22 years ago of the
murder of Carluke typist Margaret McLaughlin. Miss McLaughlin,then 23,
was stabbed repeatedly in a wooded glen in July 1973 as she made her way
from her home to Carluke station to catch a train to Glasgow.
He served 13 years in prison after being convicted by a jury at the
High Court in Glasgow in October 1973. He was released on licence in
August 1986 and enjoyed six years of freedom before being recalled to
prison for a minor breach of the peace.
He was released on bail in January last year after the Scottish
Secretary agreed to refer his case back to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
A campaign on Beattie's behalf built up such a head of steam that
there was widespread expectation, particularly in the media, that his
appeal would be successful.
However, Lord Justice General Hope, sitting with Lords Allanbridge and
Sutherland, ruled in December last year that there was sufficient
evidence to support the murder conviction.
The decision prompted calls for the courts in Scotland to adopt a much
less technical approach to alleged miscarriages of justice and apply the
English test of whether a conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory.
Beattie was returned to jail but released once again on licence in
March this year. The campaign to clear his name goes on and further
evidence has come to light since the failed appeal.
Another reference to the Court Criminal Appeal cannot be ruled out.

A MYSTERY virus has been contracted by 17 elderly tourists at a hotel
in Bute. The outbreak has caused sickness among guests at the Glenburn
Hotel in Rothesay.
The hotel, popular with coach parties of pensioners, is owned by the
Coast and Country Hotel Group.
A company spokesman said: ''Local doctors have been attending the sick
people, 12 of whom have now gone home and five are still recovering. The
cause of their illness is not yet known but there is no indication that
it is food related.''
One member of the hotel's staff has also contracted the virus.
Director of environmental services for Argyll and Bute District
Council, Mr Tom McKay, said that health officers had been to the hotel
and indications were that it was an airborne virus which caused the
outbreak.
He said: ''These are elderly people who have taken ill and we are
keeping a close watch on the situation.
''Health officers have taken samples for analysis in an effort to
trace the virus.''

POLICE mingled with mourners yesterday at the funeral of murder victim
Mr Robert Higgins, 35, from Dalmeny, West Lothian, who was found stabbed
to death in a quarry 19 days ago.
Despite extensive inquiries, police have so far failed to make a
breakthrough in the search for his killer.
Yesterday friends and family gathered for his burial in South
Queensferry.
At the funeral service, the Rev James Brown told the congregation:
''We come to this place with mixed emotions.
''Not only do we come with a sense of loss but a sense of numbness and
anger because his death was not from disease or ageing, but from
violence.''
Mr Higgins' mother Agnes, sisters Catherine and Brenda and brothers
Stephen and Andrew listened as the minister said: ''This was a young man
who cared for his family and was a good friend to many, as we can see by
all of you here today,''
The dead man's sisters wept openly throughout the short ceremony, and
at the end they laid flowers on the coffin.
The gravesidewas covered in flowers from friends and workmates.
Mr Higgin'sfamily sent a floral tribute, with his name picked out in
white roses and chrysanthemums.
The message from his brothers and sisters reflected their anger at his
murder. ''We don't know why you have been taken from us and we will
never understand why this has happened to someone who was so kind and
would never hurt anyone.''
The emotion of the occasion proved too much for one young woman.
Minutes after the burial, she collapsed, and had to be carried out of
the cemetery.

DIXIE Carr, the producer and founder of the Glasgow-based amateur
dramatic society, the Apollo Players, has died after a short illness.
She was 68.
Ms Carr, whose married name was Margaret Wiggins, founded the society
in 1967 and went on to stage 75 productions including musicals, plays,
and revues in Glasgow's principal theatres.
Many of the performances regularly played to full houses.
Last May, the Apollo Players became the first amateur company to play
the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, when it presented the musical Chess.
Born in Glasgow, she left home at 16 to become a professional jazz
singer and performed with many big bands, including Geraldo, in dance
halls across the UK. This included regular appearances at the Pavilion
Theatre, Glasgow.
While she concentrated on drama and production, her son, Mr John
Carlyle, directed and choreographed her shows.
Mr Robert Fyfe, a director of the Apollo Players and member for the
past 20 years, said: ''I have received many messages paying tribute to
Dixie from people in the world of entertainment and from the general
public.
''She was totally dedicated to raising the standards of amateur
theatre in Glasgow.''
Mr Fyfe added: ''Dixie had a terrific sense of humour. Almost everyone
who had any dealings with her can recall some humorous account of the
encounter. Many of us owe her a great debt. She will be sadly missed.''
Ms Carr is survived by her husband, Bert, and son, John.

A COUPLE with three young children were jailed yesterday for lying
about a minor traffic accident.
David Whitehead, 47, got his wife Patricia, 34, to claim she was
driving his car after he collided with a motor cycle near their home.
Winchester Crown Court heard Whitehead wrongly believed he would be
disqualified from driving under the totting-up procedure if he admitted
being behind the wheel.
The couple were both in tears as they were jailed by Mr Justice
Kennedy, who had been told there would be no one to look after their
children if they were sent to prison.
Whitehead, who received a four-month sentence, and his wife, who was
jailed for two months, admitted perverting the course of justice in
August last year.
Whitehead was driving his elderly parents to a ferry when the accident
happened near his home in Hampshire.
Patricia Whitehead, who ran an off-licence with her husband, was not
in the Nissan Bluebird estate when the collision occurred.
Mr Peter Henry, prosecuting, said: ''Whitehead was frightened he would
lose his driving licence under the totting-up procedure.
''In fact, he had only three points for a minor traffic offence and
these were already spent at the time.''
Whitehead, his wife and his father later made statements saying Mrs
Whitehead had been driving. But witnesses had reported that a man was
driving the car.
A week later, Whitehead and his wife decided ''to make a clean breast
of the matter'' to police.
The judge told the couple, of Brookley Road, Brockenhurst, Hampshire:
''It is a common event where accidents are concerned that people tell
lies and try to corrupt justice.''
He told Whitehead: ''You solicited your wife and father to perjure
themselves and you persisted in your false story for a week.''
Mr Ben Compton, defending, urged the judge to give Mrs Whitehead
community service instead of sending her to prison.
He said: ''She bitterly regrets her involvement in this. It is against
everything she teaches her children.
''She became involved out of misguided loyalty and is concerned what
will happen to her three young children.''
The sentence was criticised by penal reform groups. Mr Stephen Shaw,
director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: ''It seems particularly
unfair for the wife to receive a custodial sentence when she must have
felt under pressure from her husband.'' ''Prisons are not supposed to be
there so that the mother and father of young children are imprisoned for
offences like these. The vast majority of people would feel this is too
harsh and it is a waste of taxpayers' money.''
Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said:
''Our view is that prison should be reserved for serious and violent
offenders.''
Solicitor Melissa Haines said last night there would be an appeal
against Mrs Whitehead's sentence on Monday. ''In the meantime, she has
gone to Holloway.''

THE Catholic Church in Northern Ireland was hit by its second
paedophile scandal in less than a year yesterday when a priest admitted
a series of sex assaults on young boys.
Fr Daniel Curran pled guilty to 12 sex charges including attempted
buggery when he appeared at Downpatrick Crown Court.
Curran, 44, of Bryansford Avenue, Newcastle, County Down, also
admitted nine charges of indecent assault, two acts of gross indecency,
and assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a boy. The offences took
place over a four-year period up to March 1994.
Last June Fr Brendon Smyth, a priest in the Norbertine Order, was
jailed for four years at Belfast Crown Court for sex offences spanning a
24-year period. A row over his extradition from the Republic of Ireland
helped bring down the coalition government of Albert Reynolds.

<RECORDNO>978305322</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SEARCH for a German sailor who fell overboard in the English Channel
went badly wrong when one of his crew mates sent to rescue him staged a
bizarre ''mutiny''.
The German frigate Moelers launched an inflatable speedboat when its
crew thought they had located one of their sailors who fell overboard,
the Royal Navy said last night.
But one of the five speedboat crew apparently pushed the other four
into the water and sped off towards the coast.
The four were rescued with the help of the Royal Navy, but the
original man overboard was still missing and feared dead last night.
The drama began at 9pm on Thursday, when the crew of the Moelers
realised a man had fallen overboard during weapons practice about 13
miles off Portland Bill, Dorset.
A full-scale sea search was launched through Portland Coastguard,
involving a naval rescue helicopter, Weymouth lifeboat, Royal Navy
warship Brilliant, and two Royal Fleet auxilliary vessels called The
Black Rover and Orangeleaf.
''At about 10pm, the Moelers believed it had located the lost crew
member and launched a speedboat,'' a Royal Navy spokeswoman said.
''Apparently one German seaman saw this as an opportunity to get to
shore, and threw the other four crew members into the water.''
But when he got to the English coast, the 37-year-old man gave himself
up to a lighthouse keeper. He was questioned at Weymouth police station
and returned to the German authorities, who took him back to Germany.
''There was concern for the escaped sailor's mental state,'' the
spokeswoman said.
The four sailors abandoned in the water were successfully rescued,
although one 24-year old man had to be flown by Sea King helicopter to
hospital for treatment for hypothermia.
The search for the original man overboard continued throughout the
night, but was stepped down at 4pm today.
Naval spokesman Lieutenant Commander Nick Radcliffe said:
''Unfortunately, given the water temperature of 11 degrees and the
length of time he has been in the water, the chances of finding him
alive are very slim.''

POLICE hunting the suspected paedophile killers of nine-year-old
Daniel Handley were yesterday looking for a ''bull of a man'' after a
tip-off from a woman.
The ''major breakthrough'' in the seven-month inquiry came as officers
received 80 calls following Thursday's BBC Crimewatch programme.
Police issued a photofit of the man, seen by an ''intelligent astute''
woman, with a boy thought to be Daniel and two other men in a cafe in
the Bristol area on October 12.
The boy was seen again on a Sunday in November walking with two men
holding his hands tightly and seemed very distressed, said Detective
Superintendent Ed Williams.
Daniel is thought to have been enticed into a car near his home in
East London on October 2 last year. His body was found in Bristol at the
end of March.
Mr Williams said many of the calls gave information about the grey or
silver hatchback car seen near Daniel's home in Beckton, East London.
He added: ''Other calls actually named individuals. My officers are
seeing them at the moment.''
The man in the photofit is aged in his late 30s, 5ft 8 to 5ft 9in and
of large build -- about a 44 to 48 inch chest.
Mr Williams said: ''We have been able to build up this computer-fit
from a description from an intelligent, astute woman who was there.
''The boy, who was wearing the distinctive red boiler suit like the
one Daniel was wearing when he disappeared, appeared to be quite
comfortable with these three men. He did not appear to be distressed.''
In the second sighting, the boy was seen walking along with two men
holding his hands tightly.
Mr Williams added: ''I am concerned about the condition he was in at
that stage. I see it as a reduction in his happiness and would believe
he would have been quite close to death.''
He said the second sighting was on a Sunday in November but would not
give exact details.
He believed the first sighting was almost certainly Daniel and that he
was alive for 10 days after his disappearance but he could have been
alive until the second sighting.
Detectives believe Daniel was abducted by a child sex abuse ring and
died during an assault.
Police also issued descriptions of the two other men seen with the
boy.
One was aged 30-35, average height with blond or light brown hair,
blue grey eyes, pronounced cheek bones and is believed to have had a
London accent.
The other man was 32-38, had short dark hair and an angular face.

<TEXT>
INSUFFICIENT vigilance by lifeguards was partially to blame for the
death of a 10-year-old girl in the council-owned Dumfries Swimming Pool
by a solicitor yesterday.
Mr Lyall Moodie, representing the girl's parents, was making his final
submission at the end of a five-day fatal accident inquiry into the
death of Kerry Clark, of Criffel Court, Dumfries.
She had gone to the pool with 21 other playscheme children on July 5.
As the group was preparing to leave, a woman swimmer discovered Kerry's
body in 12ft of water.
Mr Moodie recalled that Kerry, at best an indifferent swimmer, had
twice been seen by other children during a fun session holding on to an
acqua-run -- an inflatable island at the deep end. No-one knew what
happened after that.
He claimed that Mr William Nichols, one of four lifeguards on duty at
the time, had been leaning or sitting on a railing at the centre of the
poolside ''for some considerable time''. If he had been patrolling he
would not have missed Kerry, Mr Moodie said.
He added that there was confusion between the guards and management as
to what the lifeguard's position at the acqua-run should be, and during
a fun sesssion there was insufficient staff on duty, Advocate Alan
Dewar, for two of the pool employees, said it could not reasonably have
been anticipated that repositioning the lifeguards or providing an extra
one might have been an advantage.
It was apparent from the evidence that lifeguard John Churchill, who
was supervising children at the acqua-run, was alert and vigilant and
using his initiative. When called upon, he appeared to have acted as
quickly as he could have done to recover the body.
Mr Chris Cook, customer service manager with Nithsdale District
Council, owners of the pool, said the acqua-run had been withdrawn after
the accident.
Sheriff Fletcher said he would give his findings in writing soon.

THE Government yesterday denied it was planning delaying tactics in
order to shelve some of the Nolan committee recommendations to police
standards in the Commons.
The Prime Minister defended his decision to put the proposals to a
committee of senior MPs. He said that, although the Government accepted
the broad thrust of the proposals, it was for Parliament to decide how
they should be implemented.
However, Labour leader Tony Blair warned that any attempt to delay
implementation would make Parliament ''a laughing stock''.
He is seeking a way to force a vote next week inviting MPs to express
their support for the recommendations.
He said: ''I think it would be absolutely extraordinary if, having had
an independent investigation and a recommendation that MPs disclose the
nature of their outside companies and how much they are paid, the
Government evaded the issue and tried to put it off to another
committee.''
He added that he could not believe the idea the proposals might be
''kicked into touch'' would be acceptable, ''even to sensible members of
the Conservative Party''.
Opposition sources suggested that a substantial number of Tory MPs had
made clear their anger at the recommendations on declaration of earnings
from consultancies and the appointment of a parliamentary comissioner to
police new rules. They claimed that John Major had offered the committee
as a concession.
Public Service Minister David Hunt yesterday insisted the committee
was not a delaying tactic and would come forward with specific
resolutions for the House to debate. However, he did not put a time
limit on its deliberations.
The Opposition is making it clear that any committee must be based on
acceptance of the recommendations and simply decide how best to
implement them with a time limit of reporting before the summer recess
in July.
If Ministers do not meet these conditions, Labour is likely to boycott
the committee. The Liberal Democrats have also said they would ''have no
truck'' with any bid to wreck the proposals.
Party leader Paddy Ashdown accused the Government of ''bowing down to
pressure from its own back benchers''. He said the reputation of the
Commons was at stake.
Labour sources denied they been consulted about the plan for a
committee, announced at the end of Thursday's Commons debate on Nolan by
Leader of the House Tony Newton. Had they been, they said, shadow
Commons Leader Ann Taylor would have referred to it in her speech.
The Tory MP at the centre of the latest sleaze allegations, Sir Jerry
Wiggin, flew back from South Africa last night.
Commons Speaker Miss Betty Boothroyd is likely to announce that
reports that Sir Jerry tabled amendments to a Bill in another MP's name
without informing him should be considered by the senior Commons
Privileges Comittee.
A local Tory official said last night that the Weston-super-Mare MP
should resign, if there was truth in the allegation that he tabled an
amendment, in the name of his back-bench colleague Mr Sebastian Coe, to
a Bill in which he himself had a financial interest.
Mr David Hunt, secretary of the Weston-super-Mare Conservative Club,
added that local supporters ''don't like being in the limelight, they
don't like their local MP letting them down''.
He said: ''They all feel as though they are let down if their MP comes
into disrepute. He should resign if it is true.''

EXPERTS are investigating ways of consolidating old mine workings
responsible for potentially dangerous subsidence in Glasgow's
Bellahouston Park.
Since the discovery, a series of major events have been moved to other
venues. Although the park has not been closed to the public, areas have
been cordoned off with fences.
The Glasgow Show, to be held in July, has been moved to Glasgow Green,
and the World Pipe Band Championship, in August, to Scotstoun
Showground.
The Scottish Dog Show was to have been held at Bellahouston this
weekend, but has been forced to return to its former venue at Ingliston,
Edinburgh.
According to Glasgow District Council's depute director of parks, Mr
Brian Porteous, the ground beneath the 100-year-old park is riddled with
abandoned mine workings. Records indicate that some of the coal and iron
mines date from the seventeeth century.
Mr Porteous said that, while subsidence did not pose a major threat to
the general public, planned events would have brought thousands of
people to the park, posing a possible safety risk.
He added that officials from the council's building control department
were examining the park and courses of action which could be taken to
halt the subsidence. It was impossible to say how much work would cost
or what it would involve.
The council has already had to fill in old mine workings in the city's
Tollcross Park before beginning work on the new East End Leisure Centre.

A LONDON civil servant who styled himself the Laird of Tomintoul was
last night starting a seven-and-half-year prison sentence.
Anthony Williams, 55, who had lived the high-life with #5m he had
stolen from Scotland Yard, is now penniless, friendless, and in a state
of shock following the sentence.
In a mad-cap property buying spree in and around Tomintoul, Williams
spent vast sums on the renovation and refurbishment of buildings he
purchased from money stolen from the Metropolitan Police.
He bought himself a barony and thereafter called himself Lord. He
brought employment to the Highlands, but in the wake of his disgrace he
has left scores of local suppliers desperately trying to recoup money he
owed, a judge at the Central Criminal Court was told yesterday.
Yesterday the documentation was completed on a deal with the company
Williams set up, Tomintoul Enterprises Ltd, which will give the 56 trade
creditors 60p in the pound.
As Williams was taken to the cells a broken man from Court No 7 at the
Old Bailey, there was bewilderment over how Scotland Yard, which prides
itself as being one of the most professional police forces in the world,
could have been robbed of such vast sums over an 11-year period.
During that time Williams had lived the life of a millionaire on a
final salary at his arrest of #42,790.
It began as small-scale embezzlement from a Metropolitan Police
charity fund, to pay off debts from a broken marriage, but developed
into a #600,000 year earner for the deputy establishment officer at the
Yard when he was given sole charge of running an account for a long-term
undercover operation.
Yesterday Williams pleaded guilty to 19 speciman charges of theft. He
asked for 535 others to be taken into account.
Scotland Yard was at a loss to explain last night why one man was put
in the extraordinary position of being in sole charge of a special fund
financing a long-term top secret operation into serious organised crime.
That operation is on-going and has not been compromised, according to
sources.
The court was told that such was the security and secrecy of the
Scotland Yard operation that employees in the finance department could
not be told where the money was going. Williams was enabled to draw vast
sums on his own signature without question and he was the only person
who had any notion of the operation's outgoings.
Of the #7,413,761 Williams had requisitioned for the investigation, he
kept more than #5m for himself.
Much of it was spent on buying property in the Highlands and on
renovating and refurbishing that property.
His first investment in the town was for what was described as a
cottage at 2 The Square which cost him #6000. However, renovation and
other expenses meant that he spent a further #400,000 on the building.
Other investments in Tomintoul meant buying property at 39 The Square
for #15,000 and then spending #750,000 to develop it into a restaurant.
He also bought Gordon Lodge for #85,000 and the old bus garage for
#25,000.
In June 1993 he bought the Gordon Arms Hotel for #120,000. He employed
an able manager, and extensive plans for refurbishment and modernisation
were drawn up.
That hotel has since been sold at a low price on the understanding
that the new owner took on the debts for suppliers of furnishings and
carpeting, the court was told.
Williams also bought the Old Fire Station that same year for #21,500.
''What evolved was a double life,'' said Mr Brian Barker, QC,
prosecuting.
Williams had created a new world for himself from the money stolen. He
had bought the Barony of Chirnside, Berwickshire, at an auction in
London and thereafter described himself as Lord Williams.
''The London suburban civil servant became -- when he crossed the
Border into Scotland -- the nobleman and benefactor of Tomintoul.''
However, counsel pointed out, the local people had taken him at face
value. Unknown to them it was stolen money that kept the new Land Rover
at Inverness airport and brought jobs and revitalisation ''to a pretty
Highland village''.
His wife had also been kept in the dark over where the money was
coming from. When explanations were required, and that was not often, it
was put down to a bequest from a relative in Norway.
During yesterday's hearing, Williams sat in the dock with his chin
resting in his hands. Dressed in sober lounge suit, blue striped shirt,
and red tie, he looked every bit the civil servant he was.
Until now he had been on bail. As a consquence his face was suntanned
and he had brought with him a hold-all
continued on Page 7and plastic carrier bags containing all he had been
told he might take with him to jail.
When he left the dock for the cells he left his bags for the security
officer to carry them -- that was until he was called back and politely
told that from now on he might not necessarily expect the services of
servile bearers.
There was no doubting the disbelief in the voice of the Recorder of
London, Sir Lawrence Verney, as he passed sentence. There was no
questioning the shock expressed by Williams when it was delivered.
''It is to be hoped that never again will any individual, however
highly respected, be put in a comparable situation in regard to public
money,'' the judge said.
The accused had been given an immense degree of trust to receive and
make payments without supervision. He had grossly abused this time and
time again.
Even before he had been put in charge of this special budget, Williams
had been stealing from the charity fund.
''The money stolen was wholly used for personal advantage in a
luxurious lifestyle and the acquisition of properties and businesses,''
the judge said. ''The aggrandisement was shown in the assumption of a
baronial title.''
William's legal team made it clear that, while most of his friends had
now disowned him, his second wife, Kay, would stand by him and wait
until he was released from prison to take up their life again.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon later told
journalists that he was deeply embarrassed and angry over the whole
scandal.
Neverthless, no-one had resigned or been dismissed in connection with
the thefts but disciplinary proceedings had not been ruled out.
Mr Graham Angel, the Receiver of the Metropolitan Police and the most
senior civil servant in the force, said just #1m was likely to be
recovered out of the #5m Williams stole.
Asked how Williams had been able to get away with it for 11 years, Sir
Paul said: ''Part of the reason was because this was a man who led his
life in compartments.''
He kept the different compartments separate and hid them from his
family, friends, and colleagues.
Earlier, in a statement Sir Paul said the nature of some police work
needed to be kept confidential in the very necessary job of preventing
the most serious and organised crime and catching the country's most
serious criminals.
Williams had used his position and the cover of confidentiality to
commit fraud.
The police commissioner added: ''Confidentiality must never be an
excuse for inadequate financial controls. Immediately this fraud came to
light a full audit of all financial procedures and controls in respect
of confidential operations was instigated,'' he said.
''The review had established that there was no evidence of any other
theft, corruption or fraud and there were no similar weaknesses in the
financial controls of other accounts.''
