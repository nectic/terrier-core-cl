THE OPEN PLACES
Dominic Cooper
Acarachie, Argyll, PH36 4LG
#4.99
BORN in 1944, Dominic Cooper went to work on Mull as a young man, and
from his observations of landscape and characters, wrote the
distinguished novel The Dead of Winter. It sometimes takes the eye and
sensitivity of an outsider to see in a community and a landscape what
has become too familiar to the native residents.
Cooper now lives in Ardnamurchan. He wrote an essay called The Open
Places for a book of photographs of Scotland. It is now out of print,
but he decided to keep his essay in circulation by publishing it
himself.The Open Places records the joys and rigours of living on the
west coast of Scotland. Cooper's essay is a history of the creation and
evolution of that remote region.
''Here, where the land looks north across open sea to the islands,
where the single-track road grows cockscombs of grass down its middle
and where days may pass without sight of another person, there is enough
of the original stillness and unpaced ways of living to give one the
sensation of peering out on to an earlier world . . .''
I recommend this essay for a winter's evening. It will bring the surge
of the sea, and the silence of the land into your room.

THE tall, genial figure of Eric John was much feared by criminals in
Edinburgh. One of Scotland's top detectives, chief superintendent John
successfully hunted down murderers, thugs, con men, and crooks of every
kind over a period of 30 years.
Now the former head of Lothian and Borders CID has turned his
attention to racing, one of six investigating officers employed by the
Jockey Club to enforce their laws and regulations.
John, aged 51, who retired from the police force in the spring, is the
first investigating officer to be based in Scotland. His area stretches
from Perth to Sedgefield, but he has been seen as far south as the
Knavesmire at York on the lookout for malpractices and irregularities in
racing.
Already a weel kent face at Scotland's five racecourses, his time
between meetings is spent on routine inspections of racing stables on
both sides of the Border, making sure trainers are playing the game by
the book.
Although an all-round sportsman -- representing the force at squash,
rugby, cricket, and table tennis and playing golf off an 11 handicap --
he was neither punter nor racegoer in his previous existence.
In fact, apart from an occasional visit to his local track at
Musselburgh, he knew little about the horseracing industry and its many
intricacies before his appointment in April.
In the last six months, thanks to colleague former woman jockey Yvonne
Stapleton, he has quickly become acquainted with racing in the north.
''I'm still on a learning curve, discovering something new almost
every day, not only from other colleagues, but from trainers, owners,
and even gamblers. They've all made me welcome, especially in
Scotland,'' he said.
''I now know a lot more than I did and I even understand how the
betting market moves.''
John has also learned to ''love'' racing, especially the big meetings
like the Scottish Grand National and the Ayr Gold Cup.
''I enjoy going racing and understand why so many people keep going.
It's not just the betting. There is a buzz and excitement about it all.
It's quite a social occasion.'' As for the main participants, the horses
themselves, he is full of admiration. ''They are magnificent animals,''
he enthused.
In his new role, as in the police force, he is committed to uncovering
''crime,'' but only when it breaks the strict rules of racing as laid
down by the stewards of the Jockey Club. Doping and other ways of
deliberately preventing a horse from winning come within his remit.
For obvious reasons much of what he investigates must remain
confidential. However, it is no secret that he was the Jockey Club's man
in the recent well publicised ''flapping'' affair.
The former detective chief superintendent investigated allegations
that Pretty Average (alias Short and Sweet) and Blue Faulds (Hotspur),
owned in Lanarkshire, had raced both under Jockey Club rules and at
unlicenced flapping meetings in the Borders.
He spent quite a lot of time in Hawick, the centre of flapping racing
in Scotland. His report is now with the disciplinary committee of the
Jockey Club in London and a decision is expected any time now.
If he has a favourite course, it's Hamilton Park, not only for the
perfect condition in which it is kept by groundsman Alex Ferguson, but
the friendly atmosphere.
Much as he admires thoroughbred racehorses, Eric John has no ambition
to sit on one. However, his bosses feel he should know the basic skills
of handling one should an emergency occur. With this in mind he will
attend a one-day course on horse handling at the British Racing School
at Newmarket next Friday.

* I DON'T know why, but Beauty Box has been given a copy of The Art of
Sensual Aromatherapy, A Lover's Guide To Using Aromatic Oils and
Essences by Nitya Lacroix. We particularly liked the chapter on
Meditative Sexuality, which also has a recipe for Meditative Lovemaking.
Not that you'll be interested, but it suggests adding the following to
an aromatherapy burner: 3 drops Frankincense, 2 drops Cedarwood, 2 drops
Rose. The chapter suggests: ''When you are making love meditatively, you
need to let go of thoughts and fantasies that take you away from the
present moment. Focus completely on the here and now and each moment of
being together. You will be making love in a cool way, rather than
moving towards excitement and passion.''
That's the bit we're not sure about. The text continues:
''When you feel yourselves becoming too aroused, slow down and breathe
together. Try to keep your excitement level well below the threshold of
orgasm but let yourselves fully experience each sensation of breath and
tactile contact. Let your lovemaking become a slow and graceful dance.
Touch each other with deep respect. Decide that you will try to abstain
from orgasm. This will help you to relax deeply together and remain in
the moment because you have nothing to achieve except to surrender to
the intimacy of the here and now.''
Surely, Nitya, the ''here and now'' is nothing without excitement? She
goes on: ''Do not worry, though, if passion takes over as you can always
practise this method of lovemaking another time.'' Oh good, look forward
to it. When I've got a heart condition and no less.
* The Art of Sensual Aromatherapy, A Lovers Guide, will be available
from October 26 (Smith Gryphon, #9.99).

Anvar Khan beards Steve, Rick, Joel and the chaps in their den.
AND so to men, the Beauty Box's favourite subject. We are in receipt
of the Remington Real Men Guide to Grooming, which advises beyond the
statutory bath and clean socks routine. Instead, it suggests cleansing,
toning and moisturising, and drinking lots of water instead of beer.
(Expect an increase in the male Portaloo, presently addended to every
roadsite in the country, something which always has struck me as a bit
of an oxymoron. I mean, men and their bodily functions are always
portable. Ever since mum first embarrassed you by holding you over a
drain, it's women who can't just turn their back and drop them.)
The Guide features real men, but not so real as to be disgusting. They
are an art dealer, an actor, a journalist, a rugby squad member, a sales
executive and an entrepreneur. Boyfriends straight out of Next, the shop
for nice things to complement any occasion. Each boy has a little CV
(Cool it -- Ed.) of their beauty tips and habits, and a headshot where a
Remington shaver, the size of a mobile phone, has been glued to the
chin. Steve/Rick/Lawrence/Mike/Scot/Joel (Joel?) are not shy about what
makes their skin look so fresh.
Full marks to Steve, says Remington, for using a facial bronzer
instead of the sunbed but none for drinking too much red wine. It is
recommended that he take up golf. Full marks to Rick, too, the Art
Dealer, who exfoliates once a week and cleanses and moisturises every
night. Mike announces that sideburns are returning. The experts approve,
saying, diplomatically, that ''almost every defect of face may be
concealed by a judicious use and arrangement of facial hair''.
I've got a theory, in fact, about the ''judicious use'' of male facial
hair. Never trust a man with a beard. They may be trying to camouflage a
double chin, but most likely it's a serious character flaw they want to
hide. They're shifty. Look at Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams. If he got
rid of his glasses and beard you'd never recognise him, and don't tell
me that's not on purpose.
No points, however, at all to Lawrence, who, in the face of such
wimps, appears to be macho. He says he feels a remarkable difference in
his energy levels after two pints and three cigarettes. Wowee. Betty
Ford Clinic, here we come. Thing is, is any guy with a beauty routine
attractive? To paraphrase Suzanne Moore, writer for the Guardian, and a
woman with a habit of making some sense of the world, we wanted
sensitive men, girls, but instead we got men with sensitive skin.

ONLY one woman on stage -- Susan Lewis -- and yet there's a strong
feeling of the space being filled with a host of other women, all with
something that doesn't just need saying, but needs heard as well. For,
essentially, what we hear are the voices of countless invisible
generations and Lewis, with commendable poise, is the living bridge that
filters the legacy of those oppressive patterns into our midst, as if to
say ''what's changed?''
Ladies Falling is a dainty cats-cradle of the nineteenth-century
attitudes and values that built the British Empire, incarcerated English
womanhood inside the corset of ladylike propriety, and consigned her
dark-skinned sisters in subjugated lands to second-class skivvying and
slave labour. Now, as the twenty-first century looms, that Empire is
gone but the people remain, raising crucial issues about the nature of
identity and prejudice at both national and individual level.
As Lewis sits, in elegant crinoline, sipping tea the back wall
clamours with multiple film images of hands scrubbing, sweeping,
cleaning, while voices pour across the soundtrack, in a litany of
weariness and drudgery. Walking Tall continues the themes of freedom and
identity with Lewis using movement to chart the vulnerabilities and
confusions, as well as the determined strengths, of an individual
dealing with society's attitudes to colour and gender: being a black
woman means taking pride, even if inside you're shaking.
Lewis combines an almost academic thoughtfulness towards her material
with a curious, almost impersonal style of presentation. Solo
performances can sometimes take us no further than the performer's
navel. Lewis by comparison, is able to bring a whole world of experience
before us through the exceptional extent of her own vision and her
apparent lack of towering ego. Immensely rewarding.

* WE are in receipt of the results of a recent survey on women and
ageing conducted by Clinique in conjunction with Good Housekeeping
magazine. One thousand women completed questionnaires. The findings show
that British women are self-confident and believe that too much emphasis
is placed on looking youthful. Let's face it, the last 40 years of your
life are the uninhibited years, the first few decades are spent trying
to work out who you are and what you're supposed to be doing with your
life. Here, however, is The Herald's version of conclusions gained by
the survey, which are published in full in the November issue of Good
Housekeeping magazine.
* Almost two thirds of women are worried about losing their figures in
the next ten years.
* The onset of wrinkles is one of the main beauty fears of respondents
(51%), because many are already struggling to find their husbands
attractive, after 20 years of pairing socks.
* 42% say they are worried about becoming less sexually attractive,
and should get a life.
* 56% say that they care a lot about whether men like their looks
because impressing female friends doesn't make babies.
* 87% say that beauty products are very important in maintaining their
attractiveness as is good sex.
* 100% of respondents agreed that you know you're old when you buy a
magazine called Good Housekeeping.

IT IS a well-documented fact that I am not one of those who rejoice
when England get a good doing. The roar which emanated from the press
tent as Argentinian Jose Coceres sank the winning putt on the eighteenth
green to vanquish English captain Mark James was a mere appreciation of
a fine birdie.
As England were also duffed up by Spain on Thursday, their latest 2-1
defeat means it is now virtually certain that they will free to return
to the bosom of their families tomorrow night. None will be more pleased
to do than the aforementioned James.
Mark does not like the Old Course. No, I will re-phrase that -- he
hates it.
James, who could easily ply a trade as a professional mourner, poured
out his heart to us in the dregs of defeat.
''You never learn anything by playing this course -- it is always the
same. To me it is a bit like Groundhog Day on grass.
''The spectators are so far away you don't feel they are involved. I
was vaguely interested when I was up the face of a bunker but otherwise
it was boring.''
He doesn't like the tournament all that much, either. ''It's usually
freezing and it is always held on this bleeding course. We were beaten;
that's life. When you are not good enough you go home.'' He will
probably do a couple of concert parties on Sunday.
On the sunnier side of the street were the victorious Argentinians,
Vincente Fernandez -- Howard Clark suggested it was time he went on the
Seniors' circuit -- and Eduardo Romero joining Coceres. The surprise
packet is Coceres as he took the scalp of Greg Norman on Thursday.
What did he do when he faced up to the final putt? ''I looked up to
the sky and asked God to help me to put a good stroke on the ball to
win.'' So God is an Argie, is he?
Jubilant Jose joked he would be on the phone to President Carlos Menem
asking for more pesos. Mr Menem is due for a meeting with our own John
Major next week -- don't mention the golf!
Captain Fernandez had a final request. ''For us to go through into the
semi-final we have to beat Spain and England defeat Australia. I wonder
if the English could do us a favour?'' Wouldn't count on it, Vicente.
In spite of James' comments, the sun blazed down yesterday. Why, there
were even people in the sea. Maybe this weighed with the world No.2,
Ernie Els of South Africa, who indicated he would like to come back to
play in the inaugural Loch Lomond World Invitational tournament on the
new course next September.
We also had a big banner reading ''Give 'Em the Full Monty''. I bet
you those holding it could not give us the origin of the phrase.
The Full Monty has nothing to do with big Colin or Field Marshall
Montgomery. After the war, servicemen got their demob suits from the
tailors Montague Burtons.
Often the jackets and trousers were available before the waistcoat.
When you had all three you had the Full Monty. No, I did not qualify for
one and it's the last time I am telling you this.

THE National Trust for Scotland last night came under severe criticism
following a U-turn over its position on fox-hunting over the Hill of
Tarvit estate in Fife.
It has decided to resume its ''neutral'' position, having decided last
February to approve the withdrawal of hunting rights.
The change of mind has brought strong criticism from animal rights
body Advocates for Animals, which said it condemned the view taken by
the trust's council in relation to what it described as a barbaric
bloodsport.
Mr Les Ward, director of the group, said the reasons given by the
council in reversing the ban were ''unbelievably pathetic''.
He said: ''We have been aware for some time of attempts by wealthy
landowners and other prominent individuals within the NTS to reverse the
ban, and it would now seem that the council is dancing to their tune.
''In making the decision, the council has ignored the cruelty and
suffering involved in chasing a red fox to exhaustion, which, when
caught, becomes a living rope in a tug of war when it is ripped apart by
a pack of hounds.''
Such abuse of wildlife was unacceptable in a civilised society, he
maintained.
Yesterday the National Trust said that it considered that it should
not be influenced by pressure groups from either the pro or anti-hunting
lobbies.
It did, however, state that the safety and conservation impact arising
from such consent would be monitored.

While many doctors are angry at the warnings, a consultant
haematologist explains why risks needed to highlighted.
HEALTH professionals face a deluge of inquiries from concerned users
of the seven named brands of combined oral contraceptive pills.
Many are angry that they have been given no access to the research
that prompted the warning to be issued and that they are unsure as yet
how to advise women.
Nevertheless, Dr Isobel Walker, consultant haematologist at Glasgow
Royal Infirmary, is glad the risks are now being highlighted, even if
she is unhappy about the way the warning was issued.
She runs a thrombosis clinic and has a special interest in young
people, particularly women, who suffer from thrombosis.
In recent years she has seen a far greater incidence of thrombosis
which she believes to be pill-related.
''From what was a quiet Friday clinic we have now got a very busy
clinic with referrals from GPs, specialists, and family planning
clinics,'' she said.
In all of the main central family clinics, there is now an automatic
referral procedure for women who have already suffered a thrombosis or
who have a blood relative, male or female, who has.
''I think the risks have been recognised, but most women think -- not
me -- and they are right. It is an uncommon complication, so why whould
it be them?
''I think women should be warned that if anybody in their immediate
family of blood relatives, male or female, has had a blood clot, that is
something they should mention to their doctor if they are thinking about
taking an oral contraceptive,'' said Dr Walker.
A blood test is now available to pick up women who may be at a higher
risk than others, although it is not a test that can be carried out by a
GP.
Dr Walker said that she was anxious to discover whether the research
done on the seven ''named'' pills had investigated whether the patients
who had suffered a thrombosis had their natural anti-coagulant proteins
in normal working order.
It is the anti-coagulant proteins which limit blood clots and the
sites where blood clots, but some people have defects, one of which has
been identified as the Factor V Leiden defect and is known to increase
the risk of veinous thrombosis.
''If you take a woman who is not on the pill and she has got a normal
anti-coagulant mechanism, she has a risk of one of getting a blood clot.
If you get a women who has not a normal anti-coagulant mechanism and she
goes on the pill, she has four times the risk of getting a clot. If she
has got Factor V Leiden and goes on the pill, she has 20 times the
risk,'' said Dr Walker.
''There is beginning to be a feeling in people like myself that
certainly women who have had a thrombosis or whose blood relatives have
had one, should be tested to see what their anti-coagulants are like and
whether they have the Factor V Leiden defect.''

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns yesterday told his exhausted players to
''grin and bear it'' as they prepared for a second match in less than 48
hours. Today Celtic complete the first quarter of the premier division
programme at the manager's old club Kilmarnock, but Burns shrugged off
their problems.
His team have jettisoned five points out of a possible six after
Thursday night Euro dates this season. But, unlike English counterparts
Everton who play Tottenham tomorrow, there have been no switches in
Scotland.
''We didn't ask Kilmarnock about having the game on Sunday, although
I'm sure they would have agreed,'' said Burns. ''Saturday is the day for
football. We've all been to Europe before and encountered various
problems at airports with flights and so on. You just have to grin and
bear it. It's one of those things.''
Celtic were initially put aboard the plane in Paris without their
luggage being checked through customs, and were then hauled back out on
to the tarmac.
Now youngsters like Jackie McNamara, who was ineligible in the Parc
des Princes, Brian McLaughlin, Simon Donnelly and Jamie McQuilken are
ready to return to the side at Rugby Park today. All four reported for
training yesterday afternoon and won praise from Burns for their
enthusiasm.
The manager said: ''Their attitude is incredible and has a good effect
on the club. I'll have to check on Tosh McKinlay and Phil O'Donnell, who
played in Paris but may not be ready for another game so quickly.
''There was a natural reaction in the second half of our 1-1 draw with
Motherwell after returning from Georgia in the last round, but I think
we just have to cope with that.''
Murdo MacLeod's Partick Thistle are beset by injury problems for their
match against Aberdeen at Pittodrie. Grant Tierney, Rod McDonald and
Wayne Foster are all out, and defender Tommy Turner is suspended.
Raith Rovers, who put up such a spirited show against Bayern Munich in
the UEFA Cup last Tuesday, should receive a warm welcome from their fans
when they face bottom club Falkirk at Stark's Park.
Falkirk's main worry, apart from recent results, is that midfielder
Derek Ferguson is doubtful, because of injury.

IN the same situation as they found themselves last year, Scotland
will today face South Africa for a place in the semi-final round of the
Alfred Dunhill Cup. The omens may not be propitious, since 12 months ago
Scotland were beaten 2-1 and three years before that lost 3-0 to the
same country. But this team's optimism is high and justified.
Having beaten the Republic of China 3-0 in the first of the
round-robin qualifying games, Scotland also inflicted a clean sweep on
Germany, as South Africa meanwhile did on Group 2's whipping boys. Sam
Torrance, the captain, described the result as ''a good performance,
since Germany were probably under-rated and never going to be a
pushover''.
Not surprisingly as leader of the team seeded fourth, and so under the
complex rules of the tournament with first choice of pairing and
placing, Torrance elected to pit Andrew Coltart, who yesterday beat
Alexander Cejka to record his fifth victory in as many games in the
event, against Ernie Els, who himself had defeated the German on
Thursday.
Coltart has led a charmed life on the Old Course this week. In two
rounds, the first played in a turbulent wind, and the second in glorious
sunshine and stiller, crisper air, the 25-year-old Dumfries professional
has had 11 birdies and only one bogey and lost only five holes to his
two opponents. Torrance and Colin Montgomerie have been content to bask
in the reflected glory.
Els on Sunday retained his world matchplay title but, of course, this
format calls for 18-hole medal matchplay, not the pure form of
elimination over 36 holes. Nevertheless Els, one behind Chen Liang-hsi
with two to play, finished 3, 3 -- birdie, birdie -- to beat his
floundering opponent by two strokes.
Cejka having won twice on the European Tour this season, was not to be
underestimated, as Coltart quickly discovered. The German pushed his
first drive towards the furthest loop of the Swilcan Burn, but from the
short rough more usually inhabited by tourists he pitched to 10 feet to
take the lead with a birdie.
But Coltart, with three birdies in six holes from the ninth,
established a three-stroke lead, quite enough to withstand the
irritation of taking three putts at the seventeenth, where he dropped
his first stroke, for Cejka drove out of bounds into the hotel.
Coltart's two-stroke win with a 68 was impressive overall.
Torrance's three-stroke victory over Heinz Peter Thul with a 71 was
punctuated by an unusual incident. A foot from the third hole he dropped
his marker on the ball which moved, so that he incurred a one stroke
penalty. The bogey put Torrance a stroke behind, but in the calmer
weather he had his long-handled putter under firmer control.
In this form of the game doing just enough to outscore his opponent is
Montgomerie's objective and he succeeded by precisely one stroke, 72-73,
against Sven Struver.
In Group 1, Ireland followed their whitewash of the United States by
beating Canada, the holders, by the odd point.
Either Ireland or Sweden, who meet today, could go through. The United
States beat Sweden but were eliminated. Although Masters champion Ben
Crenshaw and Peter Jacobsen had 67s and the team's aggregate of 206 was
the joint lowest so far, Lee Janzen's defeat at the nineteenth by
Per-Ulrik Johansson's four-foot birdie putt represented a technical
knockout.
Australia's prospects of winning Group 4 were enhanced by the revival
of Greg Norman's fortunes after his three stroke defeat against
Argentina. All the same, Norman had to bring all his competitive
instincts to bear in defeating Miguel Angel Jiminez.
In Group 3, Wales emerged as the surprise packet, for they actually
returned to contention after having lost 3-0 to Zimbabwe by dosing New
Zealand with the same distasteful medicine -- led by Ian Woosnam, who
came home in 31 for 68 to beat Michael Campbell by three strokes.
From that example, Mark Mouland sustained his golf to a three stroke
victory over Greg Turner with a 71 and Paul Affleck applied the icing to
the cake when, three strokes down with only four to play to Frank
Nobilo, the Welshman made birdie 3s at three of them to win by a stroke.
Nick Price and Mark McNulty, in scoring terms, continued to be the
mainstays of Zimbabwe's challenge in Wales' group. Having had scores of
67 and 69 against Wales, they joined Coltart as the only players to
break 70 twice with rounds of 68 and 66 respectively to produce the
majority of points needed to overcome Japan.

Paper Music, Bobby McFerrin (Sony Classical)
* THE strange career of vocalist extraordinaire Bobby McFerrin takes
another odd twist. A chap still best known for thinking about your body,
or a bar of milk chocolate, here conducts the Saint Paul Chamber
Orchestra with whom he holds the oddly-titled position of Resource Trust
Creative Chair. Although it is beautifully recorded, there is a
suspicion that the prefix Wall- has been missed from the album's title,
as he leads the band through light classical favourites, contributing
his own distinctive doo-be-doo-ing to selections like Faure's Pavane and
Boccherini's String Quartet No.1
Rude Hieroglyphics, Lydia Lunch and Exene Cervenka (Rykodisc)
* IF these women were angry when they recorded this, they must have
been incensed when the O J Simpson verdict was announced. Recorded in
Orlando, Florida it is 54 minutes of focused spoken rant by two seminal
voices in US punk rock. It is very funny, if you are not easily offended
and have a healthy scepticism about all things establishment. Says
Lydia: ''The goal of the enemy is to confuse, to corrupt, and to
rearrange your priorities to suit their needs. To control time, to
control your mind, but most of all to control your money.'' Don't buy
this album, steal it, then brave the live experience at Edinburgh's
Venue or Glasgow's Cat House (appropriately) on November 2 and 3. Be
warned, they destroyed a male heckler in Orlando.

Wrecking Ball, Emmylou Harris (Grapevine)
* WELCOME to the divine Emmylou's ambient folk-country-blues world,
won't you step on in? Assisted by producer and song-collaborator Daniel
Lanois, Ms Harris has crafted a pleasing new musical genre, one which is
both plangent and stately; doom-laden yet somehow hopeful; where the
paint is peeling and love has gone bad -- yet still you can't help but
view the mould on the ceiling and think that it bodes fecundity, not
decay. Yup, what you've got here is an adult set of songs. There's a new
one by Steve Earle, Goodbye; another newie, Going' Back To Harlan, by
Anna McGarrigle, plus an older one which is worth the album's
admission-price on its own: Sweet Old World by the spellbinding Lucinda
Williams. Make sure you turn out for Emmylou, accompanied by Daniel and
his band, when they all blow into Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall on
November 17.
Nuisance, Menswear (Laurel)
* MENSWEAR are the emperors of the new retro-based Anglopop, and while
their clothing is sharp, their songs are somewhat threadbare. Do you
remember with fondness the works of such perky power-pop combos as the
Jam, the Small Faces, the Jam, the Hammersmith Gorillas, the Jam, and
Radio Stars? Oh -- and did I mention the Jam? If you don't, go seek them
out. If you already do, stick with them rather than this mob.
The Lost Grooves, various (Blue Note)
* NINE pumping tracks which, as is made clear on the album sleeve, are
''rare and previously unissued slices of funk from the Blue Note vaults,
1967-70''. Stand-outs include Grant Green's take on the Isley Brothers'
It's Your Thing, recorded at the same time as Sookie Sookie, and Lonnie
Smith's live and electric Dancin' In An Easy Groove. Lou Donaldson, John
Patton and Stanley Turrentine contribute pleasing slabs of funkiness,
too. One for dedicated old-time rare groovers and new-fangled
sample-hungry record-producers.

Crossing, Any Old Time (Dara)
* MATT Cranitch (fiddle), Dave Hennessy (melodeon) and Mick ''Dog''
Daly (songs, guitar, and banjo) deliver the promised ''traditional music
from Cork and beyond'' in mostly refined, expert style with occasional
and profitable leaps into more pulse-quickening stuff. No problems
there, but of the four Country'n'Mexican songs only Tom Russell's Saint
Olav's Gate really matches the trio's instrumental riches.
Parker's Mood, Roy Hargrove/Christian McBride/Stephen Scott (Verve)
* THREE of New York's finest young jazzers (trumpeter, bassist and
pianist respectively) pay intimate trio, duo, and solo tributes to
Charlie Parker on 12 Bird originals and four of his tunes by
association. The playing is top notch: articulate, respectful,
knowledgeable, imaginative and cunning, and such is their presence
(notably McBride's big toned sureness) that it's hard to believe that
there's only three men at work here.
Little Girl Blue, Katia Labeque (Dreyfus)
* THE elder piano-playing Labeque sibling trails her imminent visit to
Scotland with a collection of duets (and one solo) with some of jazz's
top keyboard artists. Alongside Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock she
sounds too schooled, or maybe overawed, but partnering Joe Zawinul and
her fellow Scottish visitors, Cuban Gonzalo Rubalcaba and her sister
Marielle (on the aptly titled On Fire), she really starts to whet the
appetite for November 17-19.

PARIS St Germain skipper Bernard Lama expressed the fears of his whole
team yesterday as he contemplated their 1-0 victory over Celtic in the
Parc Des Princes.
That result leaves the European Cup-winners' Cup tie finely balance
but Lama, and his team-mates, know that Tommy Burns suggestion of a
''hell of a night'' in two weeks time holds dangers for them.
The veteran goalkeeper admitted: ''We are still going through a crisis
of confidence. The last place we wanted to go with just a one-goal lead
would be Glasgow and, especially, to face the Celtic fans.
''We heard enough from them in the first game when only six or seven
thousand had travelled. The noise they made will be a whisper compared
to what happens in the second leg.
''Normally I think, if we were playing to our best, we would be able
to handle this, but we have not had a good run recently. That is our
first win in five games, and it was not the best of victories.
''However, we have to hope that it will help the confidence of the
players. There are too many of us who do not have enough self-belief. It
was there in the early part of the season when we won six games in
succession. Now it has disappeared.
''What we must hope is that even this single goal against Celtic,
which gave us a win, can send confidence back through the players. If
not, then we face a very dangerous time in Glasgow. We certainly do not
believe that the tie is over.''
Meanwhile, Celtic midfielder Phil O'Donnell talked his way through the
agony of that chance which was missed by Pierre Van Hooydonk, a chance
carved out by O'Donnell, who had one of his best games for the club
since joining them from Motherwell.
The #1.6m buy impressed at this level and the chance he created for
the Dutchman should have made the return leg in Glasgow so much more
easy for the Parkhead men.
He admitted: ''I felt sorry for Pierre. When I went on to the pass I
knew I was getting behind their defence and then the goalkeeper came
charging out and I was sure that he was going to take me down.
''However, I was able to get the ball away from him, get it across
goal, but then it seemed to hang in the air a little and Pierre could
not get it on target. It was the best chance we had and if we had scored
then I'm sure people would have been looking on the return as a
formality.
''Still, most of us believe that we can go through. We have good
players, we have home advantage, and we know that the French are not
relishing the prospect of coming to the new Parkhead. The support were
absolutely amazing in Paris, but they will be even better, and more
important in Glasgow.''
Meanwhile, the Celtic fans were being praised for their behaviour in
Paris, despite the fears beforehand when tickets were being sold freely
for areas not assigned to the Scots.
A spokesman for the British Embassy said: ''There was no trouble at
all. We had had some worries because the numbers who came were far
greater than those anticipated, but everything went smoothly.''
That they did so was a compliment to both the supporters and the Paris
police.
The supporters retained their good humour, and the police worked with
military precision to keep them apart from the rogue elements who follow
the French cup-holders.
The Celtic fans were marched from their buses and from the Metro, to
the stadium with riot police in front, and in the rear, straight to the
sections which had been allocated. Others who were scattered through the
ground were given protection.
It had been a major worry for the Glasgow club, but on the night
everything went well although the kind of indiscriminate ticket selling
used by Paris St Germain must be controlled by UEFA in the future.

WHAT'S really hot for cooler days this winter? The little camel coat
has been liberated from librarians and dragged to the epicentre of style
from a long suburban exile. Its simple elegance and understated luxury
is quite indisputabley the essential coverup of the season.
If you have your finger on the pulse of fashion, a camel coat is just
exactly what you'll want to have on your back. But any old camel coat
just will not do. No, no, no. If it is not a variation on the Mod
Crombie, feminised with some shapely darting, it has to be either
wrapped and tie-belted at the waist or buttoned right up to a neatly
collared neckline. Detailing must be discreet yet distinctive -- a half
belt at centre back, or perhaps top stitched seams. The hem should be on
or just a little above knee level -- not too short, yet short enough to
allow a glimpse of leg above the top of long boots.
The desired effect is a sharp new spin on simple elegance, and
approximation of what we once called the princess line.
Wanting and having are fashion conditions separated by the process
offinding. Perhaps you feared it would be easier to pass through the eye
of a needle than trackdown that must-have camel coat at a can-afford
price. Don't despair. We have mounted our very own Desert Storm
operation, flushing out the very best buys and strongest styles
available on the high street right now.
There is nothing particularly cheerful about a very cheap coat. Our
choices (all pictured here) combine reasonable quality, distinctive
design, and great value for money. So here you have it -- the princess
look at prices to suit more modest pockets and at least two pockets
despite the modest prices.

<HEADLINE>Ibrox boost as Gascoigne and McLaren return. Rangers still in good heart</HEADLINE>

THERE was a surprising air of jollity around Ibrox yesterday, despite
thoughts of Wednesday night's Champions' League drubbing being still
fresh in the minds. Perhaps the atmosphere could be put down to the fact
that Rangers are relieved they do not have to face Juventus every week,
but then again, it could be down to the news that Paul Gascoigne is fit
and ready to resume normal service.
The England international, who has been missing with a thigh injury
since the match against Motherwell, began training on Tuesday and
manager Walter Smith includes him in a squad of 16 for today's premier
division match against Hearts at Ibrox.
''It was really disappointing to lose Paul when we did,'' said Smith.
''He was beginning to produce form, and I know he was disappointed, too.
But now he is back, and that is a big boost for us.
''We have had a good start to the domestic programme -- top of the
league and in the Coca-Cola Cup semi finals -- and it's important we
keep that form going. We must not allow the disappointment of
Wednesday's performance to interfere.''
Alan McLaren, who missed the match in Turin because of suspension,
will also return to the defence, but Scottish international midfield
player Stuart McCall has been ruled out for the next 10 days, because of
damaged muscles around the ribs. That injury may also mean that he
misses the return with Juventus.
Added Smith: ''Hearts have had a change of management and, as usual,
when you change the team about, you can suffer indifferent form, but
they had a good win against Raith Rovers last week. Jim Jefferies' teams
always come forward trying to score goals, so I think the fans will see
an attractive game.''
Rangers fans will certainly expect the proper reaction from the
players following the Italian experience, and nothing less than victory
will do for them.
This afternoon will be a big test for Hearts 21-year-old goalkeeper,
Gary O'Connor. Three weeks ago, he was third choice and now he faces his
first match at Ibrox.
Said the youngster: ''It's all happened very quickly. One minute I was
behind Henry Smith and Craig Nelson, the next I was thrown in at the
deep end. But I've waited two years for my chance, and at one stage, I
wondered if it was ever going to come. Now that it has, I'm determined
to stick in and try to make the most of it.''
Gary's first team debut atRugby Park a fortnight ago turned into a
nightmare for him when he gifted Kilmarnock an equaliser, and the
Ayrshire side went on to win.
''At the time, you just want the ground to open up and swallow you,''
he said. ''But you have to try and get on with things. The manager stuck
by me and that made me feel better.
''I've tried to put that mistake to the back of my mind and I thought
I did well against Raith last week. I know I can do even better still.''
At one stage last year, O'Connor was lucky to get a place on the bench
for any Hearts team, and for three months, he did not play a game.
He said: ''It was really disheartening and I was desperate to get a
game anywhere. Some managers seem to have a bee in their bonnet that
they can play outfield players at 19 or 20, but not goalkeepers, so all
you can do is knuckle down and keep battling away, but I felt that this
had to be my season.
''Jim Jefferies said when he came to the club that everybody would get
their chance and he's stuck by that. I feel I'm ready for the first
team. I've been preparing hard, trying to learn as much as I can. Henry
Smith has been a great help to me and he's been very supportive.''
In the wake of Rangers defeat in Turin, the young keeper could could
hardly have picked a more testing time to make his Ibrox debut.
''I don't even know if I'll be playing. If I am, I'll, no doubt, be a
bit nervous, but I'm looking forward to it.''
Jim Jefferies is without the suspended Gary Mackay and injured Willie
Jamieson, but last week's two-goal hero, Alan Lawrence, is fit.
Motherwell, who were runners-up to Rangers in the championship last
season, have been struggling to find consistency so far this term, but
are hoping that last week's home win over Aberdeen will act as a
springboard.
Said assistant manager Andy Watson: ''We've been a bit patchy, but the
result and the performance last week were impressive, and we would look
for a continuation of that form against Hibs at Easter Road tomorrow.''
Motherwell will be without full-back Rob McKinnon, who injured a
hamstring against Aberdeen. The feeling at Fir Park is that he should
have come off immediately the injury occurred, but the player carried
on, aggravating the situation.
Defender Chris McCart, who missed last week's match, will have a
fitness test to decide whether or not he plays at Easter Road.

INTERNET
* WITH the housing market in the doldrums, sales moving at geological
speed, now seems the right time to gee things up by putting homes on the
superhighway.
The Property Wave is where to surf the market. Nearly two million
people in Britain and 50 million world wide will be able to view
residential properties from Balmaha to the Bahamas and Leith to Los
Angeles on the new Internet service. Property wave is charging #30 to
put details of houses, cottages, flats and castles on their site and
they claim it's the only system giving access to global residential
properties. Potential buyers can call up the service, browse through
pictures and information.
Major estate agents Savills are piloting the site in conjunction with
Edinburgh lawyers Morton Fraser Milligan.
* WEB creation and management company Communicata have called time on
the traditional heavyweight product catalogues, directories and CD's
with the launch today of the Electronics Product Locator, a new internet
on-line service.
The company say the move from paper will suit firms because they are
expensive to produce, store and distribute. The Electronic Product
Locator is designed to reduce user search times for products and
suppliers sales and marketing costs.
For instance, a buyer seeking an electronics power pack would enter
base specifications like the voltage required and the locator would
search the relevant information on databases all over the world to
provide a list of suppliers, costs, and an order form.
* MICROSOFT have announced their Internet explorer, a browser designed
specifically for the new Windows 95 op system. The explorer offers easy
access to the Internet combined with high performance and the M-soft say
it's the first browser to include real-time audio capabilities.
* VISA International have teamed up with Microsoft in publishing a
specification to secure payments over public and private networks. Known
as Secure Transaction technology, it's designed to provide a secure
method of handling payment card transactions across electronic networks
such as the Internet. It's built as an electronic version of the card
system now in use, the STT is expected to serve as a reliable payment
system for software providers to incorporate in their products.
Richard Lonergan, one of Visa's vice-presidents said: ''This will help
calm some of the anxieties many consumers have about conducting business
over electronic networks. Cardholders expect security and protection
when they use or accept a Visa card and we want to make sure this is the
case when they use the Internet.
The Secure Transaction technology is designed to provide strong
authentication to prevent misuse or fraud.
MicroTouch Systems have launched their 14-inch flat square touch
monitor designed for PC and Macintosh kiosk, multimedia and business
applications. The TruePoint-DP 15 integrates a high resolution display
with the MicroTouch capacititive touch screen and controller. The new
display combines ease of use and high performance into the compact space
of the 15-inch format. The firm say the flat square screen reduces image
distortion and glare while making edge images easier to view. It also
gives multimedia developers more space for displaying graphs and touch
buttons. List price is a shade over #1000.
* APPLE Macintosh have launched three new PC's in the Performa range
designed specifically for the family. Each Performa comes with 20
software programs including entertainment, educational and reference
packages along with business and communications software. AppleMac say
the new range is designed for all ages and the two more powerful
versions, the 5200 and 6200 are based on the PowerPC chip and come
equipped with a quad speed CD ROM player for both audio and multimedia
CD's, stereo sound and a TV video option allowing users to watch a TV
program or video in a screen window. The range is selling for #1099 to
#1749 including VAT.

PAPERBACKS
WRITING HOME, Alan Bennett, Faber, #7.99.
* THERE are times in a book reviewer's life when only cliches will do,
and this is one of them. I could not put it down, I stayed up all night
reading it. I was often quite helpless with laughter. He writes like an
angel. All, I'm afraid, perfectly true. This collection of odds and ends
-- including diary excerpts, TV and radio scripts and talks, book
reviews, play prefaces, and the story of Miss S, the Lady in the Van in
Bennett's drive -- is one of those inevitably rare and rarer books that
give the jaded life-long reader the joy of adding a new favourite to all
his old ones. Shimmy up the shelf, Decline and Fall and Dubliners and
Aubrey's Brief Lives: make room for a sceptical, bitchy ex-working class
Yorkshire intellectual with a sense of humour so understated that, if
Bennett were a doctor, one feels he'd be a homeopath.
THE LIFE AND TIMES OF A TEABOY, Michael Collins, Phoenix, #5.99.
* IF ever there was an Irish novel that deserved to borrow Flann
O'Brien's subtitle to The Hard Life (''An Exegesis of Squalor''),
Michael Collins's talented but deeply depressing debut is it. The story
of Ambrose Feeney, escapee from a ferociously grim 1940s Limerick
childhood (full of dead cows, pots of tea, and religious devotions) into
the Irish Civil Service, thence back home and into a madness brought on
by filial guilt and his own crushed ambitions, shows the influences of
Joyce and Beckett, but lacks the former's sense of the ridiculous and
the latter's gallows-humoured stoicism. And if its supposed to be a
national allegory, it's probably as well that Collins lives in Chicago
these days.
PULP CULTURE: Hardboiled Fiction and the Cold War, Woody Haut,
Serpent's Tail, #9.99.
* THOUGH firmly recommended to anyone in love with the bitter,
dishonest world of novelists like Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett
and films like Kiss Me Deadly and Build My Gallows High, Woody Haut
offers few insights into how le style noir reflected American society
that haven't already occurred to the average fan. Post-war hangover,
bomb paranoia, the identification of crime with capitalism (or with
Communism), the death of the genre in the JFK years -- when America
suddenly had High Hopes again: on all of these Haut is sound and
entertaining, but seldom original. Which isn't his fault: pulp is a
simple (though potent) culture that offers few handholds for the Higher
Criticism. Pulp is a fan culture. This is a fan book.
PIG, Andrew Cowan, Penguin, #5.99.
* THE theme of teenage children creating a private colony in a house
where the grown-ups are fled or dead, sounds at first reminiscent of Ian
McEwan's sinister The Cement Garden, but Scottish novelist Andrew Cowan
has created something gentler and more insightful in this achingly
poignant debut. Set on the edges of a dismal new town, it's the story of
sensitive, 15-year-old Danny and his attempt to escape from his hellish
family and the racist, yob-haunted streets by taking refuge in his
grandparents' old house with his Asian girlfriend Suvinder, an idyll as
moving as it is doomed.

A BOOK AT BEDTIME
Poet and playwright Jackie Kay tells ANN DONALD about her nocturnal
reading
* I'VE been reading a book called Vested Interests -- Cross Dressing
and Cultural Anxiety by Marjorie Garber. It looks at the history of
cross-dressing across the globe though she tends to concentrate on
Britain and America. It's really a fantastic and very fascinating book
as she shows how the culture we live in is so anxious about people
crossing that line of cross dressing. It's also very funny.
One book that I picked up and didn't put down till I'd finished
reading it was a novella by Larry Watson called Montana 1948. Set in the
summer of 1948 in Montana the story is told through the eyes of a
12-year-old boy whose father is a small town sheriff and his uncle is
the town's doctor. It's discovered that his uncle has been abusing a lot
of the Sioux women, in particular the woman who works in the boy's house
and has looked after him all his life. On the one hand it's very
faithful to the 12-year-old boy's perspective but on the other it's the
story of how badly Indian people are treated.
I love books being recommended through the grapevine. It's nice if
you're sitting reading to know that someone you love or like has also
sat and read that book and wonder what they've made of it.

Cinnamon Roulade with Apple, Raisin and Orange filling
Serves 6-8
5 large eggs, yolks separated from whites
5oz caster sugar
2oz ground almonds
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
grate one lemon and juice
For the filling:
[1/2] pint creme fraiche
2oz butter
4 good eating apples, peeled, cored and chopped
3oz soft light or dark brown sugar
grated rind of one orange
3oz raisins, soaked for several hours in the juice of one orange
sieved icing sugar
Make the roulade by whisking the yolks with the caster sugar till pale
and thick. Whisk in cinnamon and ground almonds. Whisk the whites till
they are stiff, then, with a large metal spoon fold thoroughly through
the cinnamon mixture. Pour into a baking tray or swiss roll tin lined
with baking parchment. Bake in a moderate oven, 350F, gas mark 4, 180C,
for 20 minutes. Cover with a damp tea-towel when cooked, and leave till
cold.
To make the filling, melt the butter in a saucepan and add the soft
brown sugar and the chopped apples, and the grated orange rind. Cook,
stirring, till apples soften. Then add drained raisins, and let this
mixture cool. When cold, assemble the roulade by laying a clean sheet of
baking parchment on a work surface. Dust liberally with icing sugar, and
tip the roulade face down. Peel paper off the back, peeling in strips
close to the roulade. Spread with the creme fraiche, and cover with the
apples filling -- use a fork to distribute the filling evenly. Roll the
roulade away from you and slip it onto a serving plate. Dust with more
icing sugar before serving.

LADY CLAIRE'S KITCHEN
On National Apple Day, Lady Claire Macdonald declares that English
eaters are the apples of her eye
WHAT a subject -- one of those I could fill this magazine with for at
least a couple of weeks! The thing about apples is that to many people
they are a year-round fruit. But their natural growing season in this
country is the autumn, right now we are in the middle of it. Our
supermarkets have stocked a good variety of the excellent types of
eating apple grown in Britain, and they usually supply good information
about the different apples, with a guide to their flavour, and sometimes
to the history of the apple.
A number of apples come from strains grown over centuries, and Britain
has a world renowned history of apple (and pear) growing.
One of the places I most want to visit is Brogdale, the fruit centre
in Kent which has all anyone could ever want to know about apples, pears
and other fruit, and their history. The eating apples most usually found
and most popular at this time of year are Cox's Orange Pippins,
Worcester Pearmains, Russets, and Laxton's Superb.
The flavours of these apples differ greatly, and to me all are
delicious. The apple I abhor is the Golden Delicious -- what a misnomer
-- I believe the name utterly contravenes the Trades Descriptions Act. I
find much more taste in a glass of our delicious water here at Kinloch
than in the average Golden Delicious, but even I must admit that one of
the best marketing jobs was done many years ago now, when our shops were
first flooded with this very dreary apple by the French -- do you
remember the ''Le Crunch'' ad?
But to go back to apples which do taste, I find that at this time of
year it is a seasonal joy to rediscover the tastes of our native apples.
And I cook with eating apples (as opposed to cooking apples) a great
deal. I find them equally useful in savoury dishes as in sweet.
One of the plus-points about using eating apples in cooking is that
they hold the shape of their slices, whereas cooking apples fall into
soft mush as they cook.
Apples complement the flavour of a surprising number of other foods,
such as chicken and pheasant, cheese of all types (blue cheese, creamy
soft cheeses, cheddar and goats' cheese), onions, and, possibly most
unlikely to some of you, fish.
A combination of sliced leeks and chopped fresh ginger and sliced
apples stir fried together for two or three minutes, then cut-up
firm-fleshed white fish stirred into the contents of the saute pan and
cooked for one to two minutes makes a very good dish for lunch or
supper, combining very complementary flavours in a recipe so quick to
cook as to qualify for classification under the heading ''Fast Food''!
In sweet recipes the tastes which most complement apples are lemon and
orange, and several spices, most notably cinnamon, ginger, cloves and
nutmeg. Nuts, especially walnuts and hazelnuts, are good with apple
based puddings. And apples are so versatile in that they can be a simple
everyday type of pudding, as in a baked apple, with its core cut out and
the space filled with chopped dates mixed (if you like) with chopped
ginger and butter and soft brown sugar, or with raisins, butter, grated
lemon and golden syrup -- the apples need to be baked in a moderate
oven, 350F, 180C, gas mark 4, for 25-30 minutes -- to more elegant types
of pudding, more suited to a party, like the recipe I give you today for
a cinammon flavoured roulade with its filling of apples and raisins
flavoured with orange and lemon, and creme fraiche.
Cinnamon-flavoured crepes filled with the same apple and raisin
mixture are very good. The apples, cooked the same way but without the
raisins, are delicious when flamed with brandy (or with calvados, the
apple brandy) and served with good vanilla ice-cream, or with a caramel
mousse.
There is no end to the experimenting with apples in concocting new and
varied dishes -- hence my need for more space on this subject!

THE VIOLINIST
When an orchestra gels, it is a thing of joy. But for the individual
members, a musical life can be less than magical. Gavin Bell talks to
the RSNO's Jane Reid. Pictures by Edward Jones
THE room is virtually bare. There are no curtains in the bay windows,
no pictures on the walls, and no ornaments cluttering sideboards. The
only furniture is four hard wooden chairs.
But the room is filled with music. It soars from an old violin, a
vaguely familiar refrain from an Italian opera, echoing around the mind
with a sweet melancholy.
When the music stops, the violinist explains: ''Having no curtains and
carpets improves the accoustics. They are more resonant, and they make
you sound better than you are. But I love it, the sound rings and goes
on forever.''
In a few hours, Jane Reid will be rehearsing the extract from Verdi's
Rigoletto under one of the world's leading conductors. The following
evening, she will play it in a gala performance at the Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall featuring soloists from the Bolshoi Opera. For the moment,
however, she replaces her violin carefully in its case, and wanders out
of her bare front room to put the kettle on.
There was a time when Jane considered studying English at university,
but fate and family pedigree dictated that she was always going to be a
professional musician. A grandmother played the piano for silent movies,
an uncle and a grandfather were violinists, and her mother was a music
teacher trained in piano and singing.
She began playing her grandfather's violin at the age of eight, not
with much enthusiasm at first, but with increasing pleasure as she
graduated through the ranks of Glasgow schools orchestras. Her mother's
death when she was 16 strengthened her resolve to study at the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. ''I know that's what mum would have
wanted me to do, so I did it,'' she says.
It was a deicison she has never regretted, as it led to what she
considers the best job she could possibly have -- first violin with the
Royal Scottish National Orchestra. After 18 years with the RSNO, she is
still excited by its symphonic repertoire: ''The thrill mostly comes in
concerts, when there is a good rapport between the conductor and the
orchestra, and everyone is enjoying the music. Just to be part of the
music is a wonderful feeling.''
At such times, one can appreciate the excitement of playing the finest
music ever written. But orchestral life is not always harmonious. Behind
even polished performances, there may be tensions and strains not
apparent to the audience. Much depends on the conductor, the maestro who
can create magic by inspiring the players, or confusion by misleading
them.
''To stand up and conduct an orchestra you have to have a big ego, and
sometimes it gets in the way,'' Jane says. ''Sometimes they forget
they're dealing with human beings.''
There are times when conductors appear to be incompetent, or insecure
with a piece of music, which unsettles the orchestra. And as in any job,
individuals can create their own pressures. Musicians may appear
perfectly composed when walking onto a concert platform, while wracked
with anxieties that they have failed to master a particularly difficult
programme. ''When you're nervous you can become paranoid,'' Jane says.
''If the conductor glances over at your section, you imagine he's
looking straight at you. There's no hiding, really.''
In such an intense atmosphere, a conductor with a sense of humour can
do much to ease tensions with as little as a twinkle of the eye, and
laughter is common in rehearsals. Unfortunately, mishaps verging on
farce can induce a fit of the giggles at the most inopportune moments in
concerts.
The final movement of Holst's Planet Suite requires a delicate balance
between the diminishing strains of the orchestra and the fading voices
of a chorus moving off-stage. During a RSNO performance in Inverness a
few years ago, this did not happen.
What happened was that a walking frame used by a member of the local
chorus made loud squeaking noises, and evidently got in the way of the
other vocalists. The audience was thus treated to the discordant sounds
of the frame, people crashing into each other, and slamming doors.
During a similar debacle with the same music in Harrogate, Jane's
music stand added to the confusion by collapsing with a clatter. ''Once
the giggles start, they're infectious,'' Jane says. ''The Planets is a
dangerous piece of music.''
At such times, she is deeply relieved not to bear the responsibilities
of a principal violinist. In fact, she has no aspirations to graduate
from what is know as the rank and file of the orchestra: ''I feel I'm
quite an ordinary musician, and I've gone as far as I can with the
violin. But that's fine, I wouldn't feel at ease being a principal. I'm
perfectly happy to be where I am.''
Given the intensity of her work, Jane takes every opportunity to get
away from it: ''The violin is important to me, but it's not my whole
life. There are other things more dear to me.'' One of them is her
husband Donald, a freelance musician who teaches and plays wind
instruments in theatres. On the rare occasions their schedules give them
time off together, they go for hikes in the Fintry and Campsie Hills
around Glasgow. On longer breaks, they roam further up the west coast,
as far as Ullapool, to blow away the orchestral cobwebs.
On the day we meet she is in the middle of a busy week. It is the
start of the winter season, involving nine rehearsals of up to three
hours each and three concerts in Glasgow and Edinburgh. But Jane is
looking forward to it, partly because the orchestra is being led by one
of her favourite conductors, Alexander Lazarev.
A graduate of the Moscow Conservatory, he is presently music director
of the Bolshoi Opera, and principal guest conductor of the RSNO. He is
also, according to Jane, a courteous man and pleasant to work with.
Lazarev emerges at the afternoon rehearsal as a slightly portly figure
in a dark casual shirt, corduroy trousers, and spectacles over which he
peers at the orchestra in a vaguely benevolent manner.
The first piece is Elgar's Cello Concerto in E minor, which is played
with passion and flair by the guest soloist Steven Isserlis, a young man
with the looks and artistic temperament of Rudolph Nureyev. The
conductor defers to the soloist, ascertaining how he wishes the piece to
be played and communicating this to the orchestra, largely by hand
movements. ''Sometimes concertos are conductors' weak points, because
they don't like giving way to players,'' Jane says. ''But this is not a
problem with Lazarev.''
Very little seems to trouble Lazarev during the Elgar rehearsal. He is
polite, he smiles, and when a phrase does not please him, he says:
''Unfortunately, this is not so good.'' The players respond to him, and
the music swells around the fluted columns and gothic arches of the
orchestra's headquarters in a renovated church. They are striving for
perfection, and, at least to the untrained ear, they come blissfully
close.
Gliere's Concerto for Coloratura Soprano and Orchestra proves more
difficult, and the diminutive Russian soloist in a thick wool jumper and
plain black skirt is interrupted frequently while Lazarev sorts out the
orchestral accompaniment. He coaxes a flute into harmony with the
singer, he steadies the violins, he punches the air dramatically to
bring in the percussion.
You can tell John the Baptist is not impressed. As the soprano's voice
soars to the rafters, his image in a stained-glass window stares into
the middle distance as if he is looking for a way of escape. Everybody
else admires the Russian's vocal pyrotechnics, however, and they signal
their appreciation by tapping their bows on their music stands and
shuffling their feet. Lazarev joins in the discreet applause.
During a tea break, the conversation is dominated by uncertainty over
the future of the Scottish Opera orchestra, which is symptomatic of
problems facing most of the country's classical ensembles. Audiences for
live performances are declining, and costs are rising; presently every
seat taken at an RSNO concert is subsidised to the tune of #13.50.
''This is not a profit-making industry,'' a violinist says. ''There's
no spare cash to improve our wages. We're worse off now in real terms
than we were 10 years ago.'' A tuba player says: ''There's no security.
I can fall down those steps, smack my mouth, and my career is finito.''
Somebody else recalls a string player being out of work for a year after
a broken baking bowl severed an artery in her hand.
Jane says: ''We don't do it just for the money. We could earn more
from teaching. Donald and I manage to do most of the things we want
because we're both working, but there's not much left over.'' She also
says the orchestral world has shrunk since she graduated. ''It's more
difficult for young musicians now. There are less jobs and more
competition for them. Players tend to hang on to the jobs they have,
rather than move around the orchestras like they used to.''
But a sense of humour survives, notably in the form of viola jokes.
For some obscure reason, viola players are the butt of the kind of
dubious drollery traditionally aimed at citizens of Ireland. Our table
returns to the afternoon rehearsal chortling at the latest example of
the genre -- Q: Why is the thumb position easy for viola players? A:
Because they have 10 of them.
Nobody is cracking any jokes the following evening, at least as far as
the audience can see, when the orchestra and its chorus take their
places for a Fifth Anniversary Opera Gala at the Glasgow Royal Concert
Hall.
However, it is to be a light-hearted evening, with Lazarev directing
the Bolshoi soloists on and off the platform like a traffic policeman,
and engaging in amusing exchanges with a huge, bearded Russian singer
who looks like a giant Rasputin. The coloratura soprano looks younger
and prettier in a flowing white gown, and she gives a magnificent
performance which would turn even John the Baptist's head.
Jane and her colleagues are studies in concentration, their eyes
straying from their scores only briefly to glance at the conductor. She
does not seem to be enjoying the concert as much as Lazarav, and
afterwards she explains: ''There was no clear line onto the platform for
the soloists, which meant I had to keep moving my chair. It's a bit
unsettling to be constantly looking over your shoulder, wondering when
you're going to be squashed by a soprano.''
It is almost midnight before she gets home from the concert hall. It
has been a long day, and she is tired and hungry. When her husband
offers a supper of home-made soup and crusty bread, it is music to her
ears.

HOME hope Amaia Arruti produced a sparkling 65 to move into a
three-way tie for the lead after the second round of the 54-hole Spanish
Open at La Manga yesterday.
Arruti finished at 10-under-par 134 alongside overnight leader
Stephanie Dallongeville, from France, and Australian Rachel
Hetherington. Scotland's Pam Wright was on 139 and Gillian Stewart on
141 after rounds of 70.
Three weeks ago Arruti, who plays right-handed but switches to
left-handed on the greens, three-putted on the final green to lose a
chance of being in a play-off for the Italian Open which she won two
years ago.
The Spaniard, who plays two rounds a week during the winter with Jose
Maria Olazabal, encountered no such problems on the greens yesterday in
a round containing seven birdies. Her longest putt was from 30 feet for
a 2 at the seventeenth before chipping to five feet for another birdie
at the last.
Dallongeville, who learned her golf on the Normandy windswept coast,
was at home in the testing wind. Her only setbacks in a 68 were two
three-putt greens, but these were balanced by three birdies in a row
from the eleventh, and another from 18 feet at the last.
Hetherington, winner of the Maredo Open in Hamburg last month, had
three 2s in her 66.
Wright had been five under when she turned in 34. She dropped a shot
at the fifteenth but redeemed this with a recovery from sand to three
feet for a birdie at the last.
Stewart's 70 was a fine effort after a double-bogey 6 at the first.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
134 -- S Dallongeville (France) 66, 68; A Arruti (Spain) 69, 65; R
Hetherington (Australia) 68, 66. 135 -- L Hackney 70, 65. 137 -- V
Michaud (France) 69, 68. 138 -- M-L de Lorenzi (France) 68, 70.
Other scores included: 139 -- P Wright 69, 70. 141 -- G Stewart 71,
70.
Scottish non-qualifiers: 150 -- C Panton-Lewis 76, 74. 152 -- L Irvine
78, 74. 153 -- J Forbes 78, 75. 155 -- T Craik 79, 76.
* SCOTLAND'S Dale Reid shot a third round of 74 to make the cut with
five strokes to spare in the LPGA qualifying school at Daytona Beach in
Florida. She was joint twenty-eighth on 224, nine behind leader Lu
Bemvenuti. Leading scores:
215 -- L Bemvenuti 74, 69, 72. 216 -- K Webb 73, 71, 72. 217 -- W Ward
75, 72, 70. 218 -- A Munt 70, 77, 71. 219 -- E Dahllof (Sweden) 72, 74,
73.
Other European qualifiers: 221 -- K Davies (Wales) 77, 68, 76. 222 --
E Knuth (Spain) 72, 73, 77. 223 -- C Nilsmark (Sweden) 74, 72, 77. 224
-- D Reid (Scotland) 75, 75, 74.
* ULSTERMAN David Feherty shot a one-under-par 71 in the first round
of the #733,000 Texan Open in San Antonio to lie seven behind leader
Loren Roberts, who is making the most of his last chance this year to
qualify for the season-ending Tour Championship and 1996 US Open. He
fired a 64 to grab a one-stroke lead.
The top 30 on the US money list qualify for next week's #2m Tour
Championship in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Roberts stands thirty-first with
$540,135. Hal Sutton, thirtieth and $12,211 ahead of Roberts, had a 67.
Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
64 -- L Roberts. 65 -- D Hammond, C Perry. 66 -- D Waldorf. 67 -- J
Leonard, H Sutton, D Forsman, J Mahaffey, B Bryant, A Rodriguez, K
Gibson, J D Blake. Other score: 71 -- D Feherty (N Ireland).
* YASUNORI Kuramoto shot a 69 yesterday to take a one-stroke lead
midway through the $1.2m Bridgestone Open in Chiba, Japan. Leading
scores:
135 -- Y Kuramoto 66, 69. 136 -- B Watts (USA) 68, 68; H Tanaka 68,
68; H Meshiai 68, 68; S Maruyama 66, 70. 137 -- M Aoki 69, 68; G Day
(USA) 68, 69. 138 -- D Ishii (USA) 68, 70; S Yokota 67, 71; T Ozaki 66,
72; M Calcavecchia (USA) 66, 72.

FOLLOWING in father's bootsteps seems to be a trend on the increase in
recent years in Scottish football -- you know, McAnespie and son
Stephen, McNamara and son Jackie Jr, McGraw and son Mark to name but
three. All offspring have been relatively successful.
Now, welcome Peter Cormack and son. Peter Jr has impressed Morton
manager Allan McGraw so much in recent games that he will give the lad
his full debut in what should be a cracker of a match against St
Johnstone at Cappielow today.
McGraw said: ''He has impressed in the reserves, and had to come on as
substitute for Scott McArthur against Hamilton last week. McArthur is
still injured, so Peter is in.''
The youngster, who plays at left back, signed at the beginning of last
season, but had a leg broken, which halted his progress. But now he's up
and raring to go.
Morton may be going strong, but the absence of manager Paul Sturrock
after last week's scare at Tannadice will act as an added spur,
according to assistant John Blackley. Sturrock has been told to take a
rest for a couple of weeks because it seems that stress, and not heart
trouble, was the cause of his track-side collapse.
The Saints will not want to cause further stress with a bad result at
Cappielow, and as Blackley said: ''We've been playing well. We just need
to be a bit more resolute in defence.''
Coca-Cola Cup semi-finalists Airdrie and Dundee will have to keep both
eyes on the job in hand, and let Wednesday's tie at McDiarmid Park take
care of itself.
Airdrie travel to Love Street boosted by the return of defenders Jimmy
Sandison and Sean Sweeney, and according to assistant manager John
McVeigh: ''If we can't be lifted by that and the semi-final, then
nothing can.'' Airdrie's main problem is that Paul Jack is still
struggling with a thigh injury.
St Mirren will field their Finnish trialist, full-back Janne Mikela,
and welcome back Stewart Taylor after injury. That will make up for the
loss of the injured John Boyd and Gary McGrotty, both of whom will be
out for a month. It takes the Saints' injury list to 14.
Dundee face a tricky one against Clydebank at Dens Park. Manager Jim
Duffy has a doubt about George Shaw because of a foot injury and, with
Wednesday in mind, he may not be risked.
Duffy wants to build on the recent run of good results, but Bankies --
with Joe Robertson back -- have lost only twice as the season goes into
its second quarter . . . to Dundee United and Dunfermline.
The Fifers, meanwhile, may welcome back striker Hamish French, and
defender Neale Cooper also could be in contention after a long lay-off,
against Dumbarton at East End Park. However, they will miss winger Allan
Moore because of injury as they try to get back on track after last
week's defeat by Dundee.
Promotion challengers Dundee United must feel they have the chance to
stay in touch when they take on bottom club Hamilton at Firhill.
Grant Johnston, injured against St Johnstone last week, may still make
it, but as manager Billy Kirkwood pointed out: ''We have to build on
last week's result. We have been failing to do that.''
Hamilton, of course, are not as bad as their position suggests, and
may have quite a say in the matter.

* DUNCAN Ferguson will keep up to date with Everton's European
progress while in jail. The #4m Scotland striker was hit by the British
screen blackout of Everton's Cup-winners' Cup clash with Feyenoord on
Wednesday night because of a dispute between the club and domestic
television over broadcast fees.
That meant Ferguson could only listen to radio commentary in Glasgow's
Barlinnie Prison. But Everton hired their own outside broadcast unit,
and a video recording of the match is now on its way to Ferguson, who is
serving a three-month sentence for head-butting another player while
with Rangers.

SO, Rob Andrew has become the first player forced to make the choice
between club and country.
In reality, the decision was made for him when Wasps said they didn't
want him playing for them any more while he was waiting for the 120-day
quarantine period to elapse before he could take up his well-paid job as
player/manager with Sir John Hall's Newcastle-Gosforth.
The fact that the Wasps' captain, Dean Ryan, and their Irish prop,
Nick Popplewell, had also taken the Geordie shilling no doubt tipped the
balance at Sudbury and, obviously, without a club to play for, Rob was
going to have problems retaining his England place.
Andrew's departure from the international scene after 70 caps and a
Test haul of 396 points may well be just the first of many as players on
seriously big money find club commitments clashing with their
international duties.
Once international players have signed contracts with their unions
then they will no longer be the free agents that they have been in the
past.
Andrew is director of rugby at Newcastle and his #750,000 five-year
contract is unlikely to be repeated, and certainly not in Scotland.
Nevertheless, as the professional game gathers pace, I can see a
situation developing -- just as in football -- whereby clubs which have
spent a lot of money on a player are not particularly keen to see him go
off to play with the national side.
By going to Newcastle, and despite the fact that he still had a few
years of international rugby left in him, Andrew has secured his
financial future and surely nobody can blame him for that.
I've played against him a few times and while he was a good stand-off
I'd have to say that he was very one-dimensional. Often his first, and
last, instinct was to kick which was a bit of a waste considering the
talent that he had outside him.
A couple of years ago in the Calcutta Cup game at Twickenham, Stuart
Barnes ousted Andrew and Barnes showed what could be done by a running
fly-half. If the stand-off kicks most of the time then it's a much
easier proposition to defend against. I reckon that if Mike Catt takes
over from Andrew then England could find a new dimesion in their
threequarter play.
This week at Murrayfield we continued the quest to find someone to
take over the goal-kicking duties from Gavin Hastings. Myself and Craig
Chalmers, and Craig's Melrose team-mate Gary Parker were there, working
on technique and consistency. I kicked 11 from 15 and so did Gary. Craig
went one better with 12 successful shots. Practice makes perfect, and we
will now all be including goal-kicking in our training routines.
The same afternoon I had a video session with the national squad
co-ordinator, Roy Laidlaw. This is something that is going to be a
regular part of our international build-up.
Video recordings are used to analyse individual performances. Roy
regularly video-tapes Scottish club games, concentrating on individual
players, but, on Wednesday, he was concentrating on my play in
Scotland's World Cup game against New Zealand.
There really is no hiding place. Every facet of your play is recorded
for posterity. I find it helpful and Roy is superb at highlighting where
things might have been done differently. He gives credit where it is due
but strikes just the right note in outlining when different options
might have been taken.
And talking of wrong options. We blew it big time against Hawick last
weekend. Probably we've scuppered our championship chances but, starting
today against Watsonians, we can still have a big say in the outcome of
the premiership. We were roasted good and proper by our coaches Brian
Edwards and Muff Scobie on Tuesday at training but we deserved it. Many
thanks. Hopefully, things can only get better.

AYR United desperately need new players, according to caretaker
manager Gordon Dalziel, but he will have to work with the existing
resources meantime as his team embark on the second quarter of the
league campaign today with a visit to Clyde at Broadwood.
The reverse fixture with Clyde was drawn but Ayr badly need to improve
on that this afternoon and to add to the solitary win they have achieved
so far, which was against bottom club Montrose.
It is not much consolation to Ayr, who scored first but lost last week
to Stenhousemuir through an own goal, that the team who share second
bottom place with them, Queen of the South, have an even more difficult
fixture away to the Warriors.
The only goal that East Fife have conceded at home has been an own
goal, and Steve Archibald's team should consolidate their lead at the
expense of visitors Forfar, one of three teams sharing third place.
Another of these sides, Stranraer, travel to East Fife's nearest
pursuers Berwick, so a victory today for the leaders could put more
distance between themselves and at least two of the chasing pack.
Stirling Albion are due to make a charge up the table and Kevin
Drinkell's team can make up for the disappointment of dropping two
points at home last week to Queen of the South's late equaliser by
beating Montrose, who are still seeking a first win.

* LIVINGSTON would like to remain unbeaten for their first match in
their new stadium -- scheduled for next week -- and it will be a
surprise if the third-division leaders slip up this afternoon at Hampden
against Queen's Park.
However, the battle just below Jim Leishman's team could begin to hot
up if Alloa and Arbroath can win their home matches against Brechin City
and Ross County respectively. Alloa have a good record against Brechin,
who have a goalkeeping problem despite having four on their books. All
of them have injuries.
Iain Stewart, with eight goals so far, is the main danger to Albion
Rovers when they visit Caley Thistle at Inverness.
East Stirlingshire, having got off the mark last week at Rovers'
expense, could move off the bottom with a home win over Cowdenbeath.

KEVIN Mackie has been banging a drum for years and now this week's
youthful, trail-blazing entrepreneur is drumming up business for
Scotland as well. It is successful drum beating which has led to the
creation of his new Glasgow-based enterprise.
Mackie has invented a revolutionary type of drum pedal, a double beat
drum pedal which he has christened The Dualist. This drum pedal with its
two beaters and reverse drive mechanism enables a drummer to play either
a single or double bass rhythms using one foot instead of the two on
existing models.
And, says Mackie, drummers with chart-topping bands -- jazz, blues,
pop and rock from across the globe -- would kill for this pedal. It has
solved the problem which drummers have recognised for over half a
century, the need to have a third foot to play other instruments.
Earlier this year Mackie was awarded #5000 from the Glasgow Innovation
Fund for his pedal, which is covered by two patents.
It was as a teenage drummer with a rock band in Fife that Mackie first
began to work on his invention. He developed the original design using
Lego. Then, with the help of his father, who was a farmer and an amateur
inventor, Mackie started making prototype drum pedals, welding scrap
metal and tractor parts to imported basic pedals.
For several years he developed, adapted and improved the prototypes,
working on his models at the same time as studying farm management, and
then gaining a business degree with honours in marketing at Glasgow
Caledonian University.
Right from the beginning, when he first went backstage at a Fife Aid
Rock Concert in 1988 to show the band his first prototype, he received
enormous encouragement from professional drummers.
Since then more than 60 drummers from world-famous bands have field
tested and provided valuable feedback on Mackie's working models. It was
their interest and enthusiasm which gave him the confidence to continue
working on his invention throughout his student days.
A major drum manufacturer has now expressed great interest in what it
sees as a fresh and innovative idea, one with a potential world market
of #2m per year.
Mackie, however, plans to establish his own company in Glasgow to
manufacture his pedal, and since graduating last July he has been
concentrating on raising the necessary finance.
The Innovation Award gave him the initial funds to kick-start his
project, and to provide himself with a source of income while he did the
final development work, he founded a marketing consultancy, Niche
Marketing.
Alongside this business, which is successfully building on the
contacts, skills and experience gained in the course of his degree (he
already has a wide range of satisfied clients), Mackie's commitment to
his pedal has not waned.
He has made time both to pursue his own thorough and detailed market
research and also to look for an engineering company capable and
creative enough to hone to perfection the engineering and design of the
Dualist and to produce a marketable prototype.
Eventually he found Alex Mitchell of Kelvin Cision, an engineering
consultant who was able to help and within six weeks the design was
perfected, the prototype Dualist was ready, and the materials sourced.
The next stage was putting together a business package and then raising
the finance necessary to start his own manufacturing company.
Mackie is very keen to set up a business which will create jobs in
Scotland, he would then sell worldwide, either through his own network
of drummers -- his target market is the established amateur, the
semi-pro and the professional, scores of whom he has got to know through
the years he has worked on his invention -- or else by using the
marketing services of a major British drum company.
Either way, Scotland will benefit. And while Mackie will no longer be
a one-man band, the scope for one-man bands will be enlarged enormously.
As Mackie says, a Dualist will enable one drummer to play four bass
drums and the hi-hats, comb his hair, and sink a pint of beer, all
simultaneously.

IT WAS an old friend, Doug Smith, now coaching Cartha Queen's Park,
who reminded me the other day of a very important thing.
That is that the vast majority of rugby people in this country aren't
involved in the Premier League set-up, and the creation of a Premier
League set-up in Scotland has started an us-and-them attitude which is
damaging the morale of the smaller clubs and it is changing the face of
the game here for ever.
For the smaller clubs, whether Watsonians beat Melrose is of little
concern. The fact that seven kickers have been given Grant Fox videos
hardly keeps them awake at night, and they really don't give a monkey's
about whether the Craig brothers play for Hawick, Harwich, Winchester,
or West of Scotland.
The over-riding impression I got from speaking to Doug is that he, and
many like him, feel that the Scottish rugby scene is dominated by greedy
big clubs and much of the tradition of the club game is being removed in
one massive swoop.
''The spirit is being dragged out of many of the clubs, and I really
fear that if the SRU goes on this way then they could destroy
grass-roots rugby in 20 years or less. I think that some of the coaches
who have given their time over the years to nurture young talent won't
do it for much longer if the current atmosphere lingers,'' said Smith,
''and what we see as the greed of some of the big players when they talk
about money has really annoyed some of us, too.''
I absolutely agree with my old friend when he says that the clubs now
playing in the national leagues are just treated as second-class
citizens at the moment, and yet they're expected to travel huge
distances for games, and, at the same time, breed young players who are
told to move to other, bigger clubs as soon as they get the first flush
of real talent coursing through their veins.
One of Doug's points is that he thinks that there is no need for rugby
to go the way of football and create a Premier League set-up, his
argument being that rugby was always a special type of game for many.
I'll add my tuppence-worth here and say that if the clubs lower down
feel they are being treated with disdain then there is something wrong.
To have a healthy game in this country then all of the clubs have to
feel a part of the system. At the moment it's obvious that many don't.
Second class is hardly fun.
''All the big clubs in Glasgow really want to steal our best players,
and there's no point in saying otherwise,'' said Smith.
''The vast majority of Premier League players don't start their
careers at big clubs, but move there. With the current encouragement it
is likely that players will now move even sooner to get into the top
clubs, and where will that leave the rest? Remember, we dropped two
divisions in reorganisation.''
An idea Smith puts forward, and it is one that you'll hear from many
small clubs, is that they would be quite happy to let a big club take a
player so long as, in return, the big club gave an older player at the
end of his career.
But where Smith goes further is in citing the Rangers game against
Juventus as proof that to invent a system that annoys a great many of
the clubs in the country to try to be the best in the world is crass
stupidity. It's a waste of time because we'll never be that good.
''We have found our level,'' said Smith. ''We can't be world-beaters.
We have been marginalised outside the Premier Leagues because the SRU
are chasing something that they can never have, and that is world
domination. We have found our level as a country. I don't think we will
get much better or worse, no matter the domestic set-up.''
You know, I always think of rugby this way: Rugby, for most people, is
a way to relax with friends. It's a way of having fun, where training
and skills practices are not the be-all-and-end-all of life as we know
it. Most players pay a club subscription, and have a ball with their
mates and their opponents after the game.
And do you know something? That's going from the game. Almost every
poor sod in Scotland is now expected to take part in serious competitive
rugby, and then beetle home from Inverness after the match to appease
the wives. When do folk mix and have a drink with new friends nowadays?
They don't, and it's a flaming shame. It's becoming like football
where the players huddle in their own camps, have a cup of tea, and then
dodge home.
The SRU have to make every club in Scotland feel part of the set-up,
and they have to keep the proud traditions of the smaller clubs alive,
or they are simply not doing their jobs. A them-and-us atmosphere is
distinctly unhealthy.

GREAT Britain's women's hockey team last night levelled the
three-match Test series with Spain in Madrid when they scored an
impressive 3-0 victory in the second match after having lost the opening
contest on Wednesday, 2-1.
The British triumph was due to a great extent to the Scottish
connection, with Susan Fraser netting two of their goals and her
Bonagrass clubmate Pauline Robertson, the Scottish captain, getting the
third. All three goals came from penalty corners.
Susan MacDonald and Rhona Simpson were other Scots in the starting
team. Diane Renilson made her appearance as a substitute and throughout
the contest Britain were in total command and afterwards the manager,
Jenny Cardwell, conceded: ''We could, and should, have scored another
six against the Olympic champions.''

CRANES of all shapes and sizes can regularly be seen leaving the Kone
Carruthers factory for all parts of the world.
The larger ones normally leave when most civilised people are tucked
up in their beds, otherwise even the modern road system around the
company's factory in East Kilbride would grind to a halt.
Kone Carruthers is the only crane manufacturer in Scotland, and one of
only five major companies in this field in the UK.
In common with every other company in this sector Kone Carruthers
suffered when the world market for cranes shrunk by 40% between 1990 and
1992.
''There was a variety of reasons for the downturn. As well as the
general recession a number of countries cut back on their international
aid, and this badly affected our market,'' said Gordon Adie, managing
director of Kone Carruthers.
The company survived by slimming down its work-force of 120 and
becoming more efficient. Today the core work-force of 51 can build 200
cranes in an average year.
Mr Adie, who last year was part of an international management
buy-out, believes that the recession is now firmly in the past and looks
forward to a period of expansion.
The company has had a chequered history, starting off as the
independent Scottish company Carruthers before joining the Burmah Oil
group in 1974. The troubles at Burmah led to the company being the
subject of an MBO in 1981, but by 1989 Carruthers was once again part of
a large group, this time the Finnish corporation Kone.
However, last year senior executives in the company, and Scandinavian
investors, purchased the Kone crane division to become an independent
company, Kone Cranes International (KCI).
''We have 20 separate companies spread throughout the world,''
explained Gordon Adie. ''But the Scottish operation is one of an elite
five in the group.''
Turnover is now running at #7m a year.
In the past 18 months Mr Adie believes there has been a turnaround in
the industry. ''Since the beginning of last year we have seen quite a
dramatic change,'' he says. ''Although prices have remained poor.''
The increased demand has come about from an upsurge in the building of
gas power stations.
In the past 18 months Kone Carruthers has built 22 cranes for power
stations throughout the world, and in the UK Gordon Adie believes his
company has supplied 75% of the cranes required during this period.
They are working on two cranes for power stations in Indonesia and
three in the UK.
Further orders are in the pipeline with negotiations being carried out
for two cranes in the UK and another in the Far East.
The East Kilbride company works closely with major contractors such as
GEC Alsthom and Siemens, the German company.
''We have built the cranes for the four power stations Siemens has
built in the UK,'' explained Gordon Adie.
Last year GEC Alsthom awarded the company a multi-million pound order
to supply 27 cranes and 22 hoist systems for the world's largest
combined cycle gas turbine power station in Hong Kong. Kone Carruthers
will be working on this order until 1998.
During the recession Kone Carruthers dipped into the red for two
years, but for the past three years it has been in profit.
Despite being part of an international group, Gordon Adie enjoys a
large degree of independence. ''We make our own decisions here at East
Kilbride,'' he says, ''and control our own capital expenditure.''
The Scottish factory services the heavy crane market for northern
Europe, and is building a crane destined for Holland. It supplies heavy
cranes to power stations and paper mills around the world, including the
Philippines, China, Hong Kong, and Indonesia.
Mr Adie believes the boost given to crane manufacturers by the upsurge
in the construction of gas power stations is now beginning to wane, but
he is confident that other markets will open up.
''The market for our cranes will open up in the Far East, in China and
the Philippines,'' he says.
He is sure Kone Carruthers will capture a fair share of these
expanding markets, helped, he says, by a monitoring device KCI has
developed to analyse how hard a crane is working.
''According to new EU regulations you have to be able to tell how hard
a crane is worked, and when it should be rested. We have equipment that
can tell you immediately how hard one of our cranes is working, and
other crane manufacturers are struggling to catch up with us in this
area.''
Among Kone Carruthers's current orders is a large, one-off,
made-to-order crane for British Steel Engineering in Workington,
Cumbria, while another recently-won order is destined for the Thames.
Costain Oil &amp; Gas Engineering gave the East Kilbride firm the contract
to design and build a Goliath crane for its client Cory Environmental,
London municipal waste compressors.
Due to be delivered in June, 1996, the crane will operate over a
public walkway and will move loaded and empty waste containers over the
Thames.
The Goliath will have storm locks to hold it on station during high
winds.
Next year Mr Adie is planning to diversify, which will mean the
work-force expanding by 20%. He refused to be drawn further on what type
of expansion, other than to say that it would still involve cranes.
In a fortnight's time the company changes its title to KCI Carruthers
Ltd, part of KCI Kone Cranes International, but it will continue to
apply Scottish engineering skills to attract orders from throughout the
world.
Scottish engineer John Hornsby Carruthers, who was 50 when he
established the business in Polmadie, Glasgow, in 1887, would certainly
approve.

THE Premiership is entering what the Chinese proverb calls interesting
times. May you live in interesting times, said Confucius, or somebody
very like him, but often the old adage is a curse rather than an
injunction to have fun and enjoy the good life.
Melrose lead the SRU Tennents Premiership table with six wins from
eight outings compared to the five victories logged by the chasing pair,
Watsonians and Boroughmuir.
Today 'Muir and Melrose are head-to-head at Meggetland. A win for the
visitors would cause Peter Wright and his men to drop out of immediate
contention while victory for Melrose -- no matter how Watsonians fare in
their clash with Stirling County -- would enhance their position at the
head of the standings. Interesting times, indeed.
Additionally, the premiership is at an interesting stage for those
individuals harbouring international aspirations.
Specifically, at Meggetland today Stuart Reid, who has played some
fine rugby this season, will not need reminding that Scotland play
Western Samoa on November 18 and, although he has been here before, that
first full cap lies tantalisingly there for the taking.
Reid's Boroughmuir team-mate Derek Stark is another for whom
opportunity knocks. Craig Joiner is out of the Western Samoan Test with
a troublesome foot and the right wing berth lies vacant.
At the moment, only the national selectors know whether or not Stark
has done enough to answer all of those old questions about defence and
so on, but there is no gainsaying the fact that as a fleet-of-foot
finisher there are few like him in the Scottish game.
One Meggetland man who has secured his place in the Scotland side is
the skipper, Peter Wright. The tighthead prop was one of the bulwarks of
the Scottish operation last season and he is confident that his side can
make it two out of two against Melrose.
''There's no reason why we can't do the double. We've played well over
the last two or three weeks. We've been getting more consistency into
our game. As always, it will be decided up front and if we can get on
top there then I think our backs are too experienced and too good for
Melrose.''
When the two sides last met, at the Greenyards on the second
Premiership Saturday, Melrose did not have their two Antipodean imports,
Nick Broughton and Isaac Fea'unati. The Kiwi and the Western Samoan have
more than earned their corn since enlisting with Melrose but Wright does
not consider that they will make much difference to the equation today.
''They're good players, right enough. You don't get to play for
Wellington and Otago 'B' without being able to hold your own. But
Melrose have always had good back rows, so there's nothing out of the
ordinary there,'' he said.
On the wider front, the Boroughmuir captain is an avid backer of the
new-look season. ''In an ideal world, if we are sticking with eight
teams, then probably there should just be one going down and if there
are to be two relegation candidates then 10-team divisions would be
better.
''However, I like the format of a short, sharp league season. It's
intense rugby every Saturday and I've got no doubt that it raises the
standard. It means that every player in the Premiership has to peak
every Saturday for three months and that can only be good for the
game.''
Elsewhere in Premiership I, Stirling, with the influential Kenny
Harper restored, could do the business over Watsonians if only they can
erase the memory of a lamentable performance against Hawick last
weekend; Heriot's are desperate for a relegation-easing home win over
Hawick, and bottom-placed Gala have little to play for but pride against
injury-striken Edinburgh Accies for whom corporate membership of BUPA
might have been no bad pre-season investment.

GREGOR Townsend makes his third appearance for his new club,
Northampton, against Newcastle-Gosforth today and on Monday he will join
the serried ranks of pinstriped commuters for the first day of his new
job in the City of London.
The former Gala stand-off signed up with Ian McGeechan's Northampton
only after a summer of rugby and soul-searching with the Warringah club
in Australia.
It had been a tough call for the young Borderer to make. Gala had
nurtured his precocious talent and had stood by him even when that
natural flair spilled over into the kind of absent-minded gaffe that his
Scotland team-mates branded Toonie-isms.
Townsend made his Scotland debut as a replacement against England at
Twickenham when Stuart Barnes scorched back into the English side and
when Scotland were seriously disrupted by injuries to Craig Chalmers and
Scott Hastings.
By last season, early promise had matured into something altogether
more substantial and the Toonie flip at the Parc des Princes which sent
Gavin Hastings storming away for his historic try, plus a try of his
own, has entered the annals of rugby folklore. He made his twelfth
appearance for Scotland at Twickenham as England won the Grand Slam and
seemed set to blossom on the high veldt of South Africa at the World
Cup.
Then fate took a hand, or more accurately, a leg. Playing for Gala
against Hawick at the season's end, Townsend suffered a serious knee
ligament injury and he was out of the World Cup party.
Initially, it was feared that he would be out for a year but the
injury healed well and he was able to take up the long-standing offer to
return to the Warringah club in Sydney.
Over the summer, too, he graduated with an honours degree in history
and politics from Edinburgh University and, with employment prospects
uppermost in his mind, Northampton won the battle to secure his rugby
services. He has won a place on the Royal Bank's graduate trainee scheme
and starts on Monday in their City office, a 55-minute train journey
from his new Northampton base.
''It has all worked out well. Actually, I've been up and down from
Edinburgh all week for a course and went back to Northampton on Thursday
night for training before coming back to Edinburgh and then going down
to Newcastle for the game.
''I've been impressed with everything that I've seen at the
Northampton club. It's just so much more professional than anything I've
encountered at club level before.
''I've had one game with the seconds and a couple at outside centre
with the firsts. A fortnight ago we beat Bedford and last weekend we
beat Blackheath 69-14 when I was lucky enough to score three tries,'' he
said.
Northampton currently lie joint top, with London Scottish, of the
English second division and look virtually certain to regain their place
in the top echelon.
''It's hard to make any direct comparisons between the English second
division and the Scottish first because Northampton have, basically,
been streets ahead of the opposition.
''I would reckon, though, that Northampton would be more than a match
for a Scottish district side. The whole set-up down here is just so much
more professional, in the sense that it's so much better organised.
''There's a full-time chief executive and Geech is full-time director
of rugby. Despite the fact that we're currently in the second division,
Northampton would see themselves as one of the top four or five sides in
England. That's certainly the aim.
''I've been playing outside centre. I'd rather play stand-off but it's
not an exclusive thing. It's not black and white. I'd be happier at
stand-off but I'm more than happy to play centre. In the longer term,
I'd like to settle at stand-off but, certainly on the couple of games
I've had down here, I've seen a lot of the ball and it's gone well.''
Townsend shares a flat on the outskirts of Northampton with a couple
of club-mates and although it is early days he has no regrets about
making the move south.
''I'm just getting settled in but, no, there are no regrets It was a
tough decision to make and I thought long and hard about it over the
summer but I'm enjoying my rugby and now I've got the new job to look
forward to as well.''
Townsend has joined fellow Netherdale emigrant Mike Dods at Franklins
Gardens. Dods returned from his summer sojourn with Otago quicker than
Townsend did from Australia and has played virtually from the start of
the season.
Last weekend Dods was switched from full back to the right wing where,
according to Townsend, he acquitted himself well.
With a foot injury to Craig Joiner ruling him out of the Murrayfield
Test against Western Samoa in a month's time what chance two Northampton
Scots lining up against the heavy-hitting Samoans? Place your bets now.
I've been impressed with everything I've seen at Northampton. It's
just so much more professional than anything I've encountered at club
level before

MONS can prove the hero at Doncaster today as Britain's Group 1
programme ends not with a bang but with a whimper.
A year ago Celtic Swing enlivened the Racing Post Trophy with one of
the best performances ever seen by a two-year-old in this country, a
12-length success from subsequent Irish Derby third Annus Mirabilis.
Now 12 months on, only four colts go to post for the #75,000-added
one-mile contest won by other greats such as Vaguely Noble and Reference
Point in its 34-year history.
But the paucity of runners means that Luca Cumani has a great chance
to gain his first Group 1 two-year-old victory with Mons, who has
developed into a high-class colt as he has been stepped up in trip.
Over six furlongs, Mons looked a smart prospect in winning a maiden at
Newmarket.
Over seven furlongs, he graduated to Listed company with a gutsy
victory at Newbury.
And when stepped up to a mile, he ran away with last month's Group 2
Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot, powering home five lengths clear of More
Royal.
He can show that Alhaarth won't have things all his own way in next
year's Classics with another impressive performance today.
Prince of India is the clear form choice for the Racing Post
Conditions Stakes.
The Lord Huntingdon-trained colt is a better animal than is usually
seen in a Class B event, having come very close to landing a Pattern
race when half-a-length second to Pipe Major in Group 3 company at
Newmarket in July.
A disappointing effort at Evry later in the month almost certainly had
a physical explanation as he has not been seen out since.
But the colt has a record of running well fresh after a lay-off.
And his shrewd trainer would not be bringing him back so late in the
season -- nor would he have booked Pat Eddery for the ride -- were he
not convinced there were races to be won with him.

HARRY Lovell, managing director of Oasis Swimming Pools, has got
himself a new car. Well, the truth is it's five years older than his
previous car -- but Harry is delighted.
The explanation is that Harry is one of these old car freaks who
somehow manages to get pleasure from burying himself under a bonnet, and
he has just finished restoring a 1968 Mk2 Jaguar to its original glory,
which means he has given up his 1973 Corvette Stingray.
Over the past four years Harry has restored the leather seat
upholstery, and the original walnut fascia and trim.
This is the longest Harry has worked on any single car, but our
glorious summer held him up as it increased demand for garden swimming
pools.
Sporting chance for motivation
KPMG is running a seminar linking sport and business at the Stirling
Highland Hotel on October 26, to focus on the need for motivation and
communication skills in business management.
Such are also required by top athletes, and KPMG has among its
speakers at the ''Leaders Building Teams'' seminar three women who
reached the top in their sports.
Tracy Edwards, who captained the all-woman crew which took part in the
Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race, Mary Peters, the Northern Irish
pentathalon Olympic gold medallist, and Rebecca Stephens, who climbed
Everest, will analyse the basis on which they achieved sporting success.
Other speakers will include two ex-Army majors and a psychologist with
an international rugby squad.
The seminar is free and there are only six places remaining. Chief
executives or managing directors who think that one of their young
managers could benefit from such a seminar should contact Shona Conacher
at KPMG on 0131-222 2000.
Ghia change for another Tory
JACKSON Carlaw, managing director of Wylies, the Ford franchise car
group, has long been known as a staunch supporter of the Tory Party, and
was even many years ago a Tory candidate in a Queen's Park by-election.
However, poor Jackson cannot be blamed if he is beginning to think
that the Conservative Party hierarchy is starting to take his support
for granted after Ian Lang MP drove off, leaving him without a car.
The car ''theft'' occurred when Mr Lang, now President of the Board of
Trade, called in at Wylies showroom in Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow,
looking for a new car. He had his eye on the American-designed Probe,
but then spotted the 24-valve Mondeo Ghia, which Jackson Carlaw was
driving, and took a fancy to it.
Mr Lang lost interest in the Probe and drove off, owner of the
top-of-the-range Mondeo Ghia. Perhaps he had heard that another of
Wylie's customers, Eastwood MP Allan Stewart, is the owner of a Probe,
and decided to go one better.
Moat lowers the drawbridge
CAMPBELL Aird, manager of Moat House International Hotel, has had to
put up with workmen repairing the road at the front of the hotel for 10
months, after last winter's flooding.
Work is now completed, and once again customers can enter via the
front door instead of the back.
To further raise Campbell's spirits, the planning authorities have at
last given the hotel permission to have signage on top of the imposing
Clydeside building.
To complete his glad tidings, the Moat House Group is changing the
titles of all its hotels and from next month the four-star hotel will be
known as the Glasgow Moat House.
Campbell reckoned these three developments called for a party, so on
November 9 guests will be invited to see a helicopter unveil the roof
signage while 1000 balloons are released and tugs in the Clyde make an
impressive spray with water cannons.
There's just no accounting
THE one thing which accountants are not famous for is giving their
customers money -- the cash flow is normally in the opposite direction
-- but Livingston chartered accountants Glen Drummond have introduce a
money-back guarantee if pre-set targets are not met within agreed
timescales.
Too good to be true, you might think, but partner James Gray assured
Business Diary: ''We will always aim to increase a company's profits
rather than concentrating solely on reducing tax bills. In appropriate
circumstances that commitment to growing profits will be backed by
money-back guarantees.''
Rotunda bid to become casino
GLASGOW could have another casino, if an application for a gaming
licence is granted next week by the Glasgow Gaming Board to North
Rotunda Casino Ltd.
The company, whose directors include Renato Paladini and Maria Romano
who at present run the North Rotunda restaurants, has already passed two
of the three hurdles you have to clear before you can open a casino.
They have planning consent to use the building as a casino, and the
Gaming Board has given them a certificate of consent to say that they
are fit and proper persons to run a gaming establishment.
At present Glasgow has four casinos, the three operated by Stakis --
Princes, Chevalier, and Regency -- and Stanley Leisure's Berkeley. But
North Rotunda Casino hopes the licensing board will look favourably on
its application next Friday as it is an independent Glasgow company.
The casino would be within the existing Rotunda building.
Return of the World Bank
THE World Bank is heading back to Scotland next year after the success
of April's seminar in Glasgow which 95 companies attended.
Since then a number of Scottish companies have benefited from business
generated by the World Bank, which in the fiscal year '94 made new
lending commitments totalling $20.8bn.
Scottish Trade International, organising next year's seminar, says it
is likely to be held on February 8 in Edinburgh.
Senior representatives of the World Bank will give comprehensive and
practical advice on how Scottish companies can take advantage of the
bank's funding of projects.
If you are interested in attending, contact Angela Davey at Scottish
Trade International on 0141-228 2883.
Seeing how others do their best
STRATEGEM management and marketing consultancy is organising a
programme of visits to companies demonstrating best practice, as part of
the Scottish Office's Inside Scottish Industry programme.
A number of Scottish companies have agreed to open their doors to give
other companies a behind-the-scenes look at how they conduct their
business.
Next month's programme includes visits to Kinloch Electronics in Port
Glasgow, Albyn of Stonehaven, KMT Eurotool &amp; Design in Glasgow and the
Gleneagles Hotel.
If you are interested in going on one of these ''best practice''
visits, call Strategems Hotline 01786 446664, or if you are a small to
medium-sized company, ie, you employ fewer than 250 people and believe
you can demonstrate best management practice, you could asked to be
considered as a host for a future visit.
Flaky goings-on at Kellock Kup
PARTICIPANTS in the Kellock Kup five-a-side tournament on Friday,
October 13 -- the results of which just missed last week's Business
Diary deadline -- must have been left wondering if it was all a fix, or
something to with the date.
First of all, one team withdrew, leaving only 13 in the tournament,
then Kellock won their own tournament, beating Rutherford Manson Dowds
3-2 on penalties after drawing 2-2.
At the same time Kellock's parent company, the Bank of Scotland, won
the prize in the runners-up tournament.
The losers -- who included Price Waterhouse, Ernst &amp; Young and Arthur
Andersen -- began to think it was all a fix when Kellock presented
everyone who participated with specially-produced skip caps emblazoned
with the legend ''Ahead of the opposition''.
Welcome a Greek giving lifts
MADE in Scotland managing director Kathleen Hardie felt slightly
embarrassed this week when she read in the newspapers about 28-year-old
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, boss of the Greek Stelmar Tankers shipping line,
whose airline EasyJet is launching low-cost flights out of Glasgow and
Edinburgh to Luton.
She recognised the face in the newspaper photographs as the gentleman
who gave her and her companion a lift in a power boat from the Greek
island of Hydra to Athens so that they could catch their flight to
Glasgow.

REVERE looks to be the value bet in the St Simon Stakes tomorrow at
Newbury. He opened his account with a win first time out in a Listed
race which clocked the best time on the card that day at Kempton.
He must have disappointed trainer Paul Cole when he ran a stone below
form at Haydock, but bounced back after a break to win a second Listed
race with plenty in hand.
Labibeh is likely to be a market leader after a surprise win at Ascot
in a fillies race, but that victory may have owed much to the sticky
going which upset the form of her rivals. She cannot be recommended at
short odds in her first run in this company on decent ground.
John Dunlop is well in front in the trainers' league and can add to
his prize money with Thracian in the Radley Stakes. This Green Desert
filly impressed when scoring at Nottingham and there is reported to be a
lot of stable confidence that she can complete a hat trick today.
At Doncaster John Dunlop has paid #15,000 to supplement the
progressive Beauchamp King for the Racing Post Trophy which suggests the
rest of us might risk something more modest on him landing the prize.
Mons won the Royal Lodge in style and is the obvious danger, but
Beauchamp King left Jack Jennings further behind at Haydock than Mons
could manage at either Newbury or Ascot. Even Top looked stretched when
he attempted a mile at Sandown and may find this a furlong too far.
Resounder came good at York where he took a drop in class after twice
finding Group company too hot to handle, but the timing was not good
enough to justify favouritism off top weight. I will oppose him with
Greek Icon, who twice won comfortably over this trip and was with the
leaders before being defeated by the extra furlong at Newmarket.
Prince of India comes down in class for the Racing Post Conditions
Stakes and enjoys a 10lb pull over Moon King for a narrow defeat in May.
He should be a banker in a disappointing field.

SCOTCHING THE MYTHS
Jim Hewitson
#9.99p
* FIRST a declaration of interest. The author is a friend and a better
one you couldn't meet in a month's walking. He was the best news editor
The Glasgow Herald (for that was its name in his day) never had. Then
one day he upped and left; packed his family off to Papa Westray for a
slower -- and, for Jim, a more appropriate -- way of life. It was our
loss.
He kept in touch with newspapers by remote control, providing weekly
dispatches of news, not from today, but from far off yesterdays and the
long gone days before that. Regular readers of our Weekend Extra will be
aware that, in his own inimitable style, he continues to continue. The
bicycle was no accident.
Scotching the Myths is a natural development of his gloriously unique
brand of journalism. A celebration of the little-known (but none the
less salient) facts from our curious nation's past.
It is a book, as the author says in his introduction, into which the
reader should dip. Maybe dive is a better word. For it is a
swimming-pool of indispensable information.
The book is impossible to describe. The only definition you can give
is negative: it is not fiction. Otherwise it is everything. Everything
Scottish.
It is a gentle nosegay of nostalgia. It is a compendium of all things
importantly trivial. It is a collection of wonderful essays from a
writer of distinction and humour.
It is witty, informative, rich in irony, and, from first page to last,
a most pleasurable experience. Its greatest achievement is to make
history interesting. It will make you smile and, perhaps, even make you
laugh out loud.
The author declares that the book has its roots in what was originally
''a pile of scribbled notes on Scottish dates, tittle-tattle, and
folklore''. It is, by its nature, a subjective account of life in
Scotland during the past five centuries.
A colourful, off-the-wall, backdrop to our history.
For what it is worth, my personal favourite is a modern one. The pilot
on the Highlands and Islands air service whose jolly jape was to put his
plane on auto-pilot, emerge from the cockpit trailing a length of string
and hand it to an unwitting passenger with the words: ''Look after the
plane while I go for a pee''.

MANY people at one time or another have had the frustrating experience
of needing to cash in an endowment life assurance policy early. This can
mean losing a substantial amount of money, especially in the early
years, and a better option could be to leave the policy paid up so that
no more premiums are paid but bonuses continue to accumulate until the
maturity date.
If it is necessary, though, to raise money on the policy, an
alternative to surrender might be to sell or auction it, a practice that
has become increasingly popular in recent years and which can bring in
more cash than the surrender value on suitable policies.
It is often possible, of course, to take out a straightforward loan on
the policy, but the amount is limited and interest has to be paid.
There are various organisations which specialise in buying or
auctioning these policies, and the growth of this business can be seen
from the fact that the market in traded endowment policies (TEPs) has
increased dramatically from #5m to #150m a year in only about six years.
Even so Policy Portfolio, the longest established market-maker in
TEPs, points out that this still only represents in the region of 20% of
the policies which are surrendered but are equally tradeable on the
market.
In general terms, experience has shown that policyholders can obtain
between 10% and 30% more by selling the policy to a market-maker rather
than surrendering it to the life company.
Nevertheless, with approximately 80% of policies still being
surrendered, a considerable majority of people are missing out on
attaining potentially hundreds, and possibly a good deal more, of pounds
extra for their policies.
Naturally, not all policies fit the requirements. The ones likely to
attract a better selling price are those which are at least six years
old and have a surrender value of #2000 or more.
Anyone contemplating selling their policy will need to supply quite
comprehensive information so that it can be assessed. This includes the
premium amount shown on the policy document -- if the policy was issued
before March 14, 1984, the premium being paid will normally be one from
which tax has been deducted. Should premiums increase over a period of
years, the maximum amount payable will be required.
The basic sum assured -- that is the amount which participates in
profits -- will also be required and can be found on the policy schedule
and usually on the bonus notice as well. The bonus statement will show
the total attaching bonuses (also called the reversionary bonus) and the
date on which these apply.
Surrender values of policies will be supplied by the company with
which the policy has been taken out and should be as recent as possible,
including any terminal bonus if applicable.
Of course, endowment policies should ideally be held until maturity
(or death in the case of whole life policies) so that the full benefit
is derived. But for a variety of reasons this is seldom the case, and if
there is an alternative to straightforward surrender of the policy which
can bring in more money, it would seem sensible to take advantage of it.

SCOTLAND'S bid for World Cup glory ended in failure, but with plenty
of pride, at Castleford last night as they lost 20-10 to the Cook
Islands. Alan Tait's brave troops appeared to have a place inthe
Emerging Nations final within their grasp when they led at the break.
But the multi-talented South Seas' men grabbed the glory with a
devastating late burst.
Scotland took the lead after 15 minutes. Darrall Shelford was held
down after the tackle, and Graham Thompson landed the penalty from 35
metres.
Cook Islands hit back immediately. Denvour Johnston was blocked a yard
short of the line, but he was able to pass to winger Ngiri Tariu, who
slid in for the try.
The Scots suffered another blow when Mark Smith was led off with a
face injury. He was replaced by Alex Killen. Scotland refused to wilt
under more pressure -- and they were rewarded with a superb score. The
ball was spun out from Thompson to Shelford, and his pass gave Tait the
chance to power through three challengers to score.
The Scots pushed hard after the break, but it was the islanders who
scored a cracking try. However, there was controversy. The ball was
passed through at least eight pairs of hands before Sonny Shepherd raced
over, but the Scots were convinced that he had not grounded it properly.
Meti Noovao added the goal-points from an acute angle.
There was more dismay for Scotland when winger Stuart McCarthy dived
over. However, the ball squirmed from his grip before he landed. The
islanders galloped upfield with Shepherd going over again despite a fine
tackle on Alan Tuara by Tait. Then Tariu dashed in for a try, converted
by Noovao, to put the game beyond Scotland's reach.
Tait had the last word as he surged over in the dying seconds, with
Thompson adding the goal.

THE INGENIOUS MR BELL
Brian D Osborne
Argyll Publishing, #15.99
ON MONDAY August 10, 1812, The Glasgow Herald informed its readers:
''We understand that a beautiful and commodious boat has just been
finished, constructed to go by wind-power, and steam, for carrying
passengers on the Clyde between Glasgow, Port Glasgow, Greenock, and
Gourock. On Thursday it arrived at the Broomielaw in three hours and a
half from Port Glasgow.''
What were the stove-hatted men watching from the Clyde quay that
historic day? A 42ft steamboat, its paddles churning, built by Henry
Bell, called the Comet. It was painted in different colours, with its
small figurehead of a lady in a coloured dress pouting her red cheeks,
its iron funnel also serving as a mast for a square sail to take
advantage of a favourable breeze. For the squeamish there were ''two
handsome beds''.
Given Bell's contribution to British science, it is a disgrace that we
have had to wait until now for a proper biography, and Brian Osborne
tells an absorbing story that reads in places like a film script.
Bell was born in Torphichen in 1767, and became an apprentice
millwright. In 1786 he went to work in the Bo'ness shipyards, and
extended his experience by an 18-month sojourn in London under the
supervision of John Rennie, the noted engineer. By 1790 Bell was a
builder-cum-architect working in Glasgow, and was already obsessed with
water, proposing a scheme for giving the rapidly expanding city a water
supply from Stonebyres Linn, 30 miles upriver near Lanark.
Bell became proprietor of the Baths Inn, Helensburgh, which catered
for the new fashion of sea-bathing. It occurred to him that the six-hour
coach journey from Glasgow over rutted roads could be avoided if his
customers came down the Clyde. Steam propulsion was the way to fill his
bedrooms.
As Osborne points out, the inventive innkeeper was ''by no means the
first to try to make a practical and commercial success of steam
navigation''. Patrick Miller's experiments in 1788 at Dalswinton Loch in
Dumfriesshire, and the trials of the Charlotte Dundas on the Forth and
Clyde Canal, had demonstrated that steam propulsion was technically
possible.
There were also the experiments of the American steamboat pioneer
Robert Fulton, an Indiana Jones character known to Bell who built the
Nautilus submarine and designed torpedoes. Fulton's and America's first
successful steamboat went into commercial service between New York and
the state capital of Albany in September 1807, and at 150 miles each way
was a considerably more ambitious route than that which the Comet was to
pioneer in Scotland five years later.
But this does not detract from Bell's achievement. As Osborne states:
''Whatever the imperfections of Bell's work, however shady his
theoretical grasp, the unavoidable fact remains that with the Comet Bell
had achieved the dream of practical steam power at sea and ushered in
the new age''.
The Comet was lengthened to 73ft for its pioneering service in West
Highland waters. Bell could not spell, but he knew what he wanted: ''to
obtain the grate object of cheap and expedishous conveyance of cattle,
pipale, and goods between the western Islands and the low countray . . .
'' The Comet carried thousands of sheep-shearers and young women in
search of work.
Maybe maddened by the painted lady on the Comet's prow, an Argyllshire
clergyman complained that Bell ''being puffed up by pride in his
abilities . . . did lately Conceive a Ship to go on the waters, not by
dint of the Clean winds of the Air ordained by God, but by means of fire
which burned and a great Smoke . . . ''
It was not divine vengeance, but a violent storm that wrecked the
Comet at Craignish Point on December 1820. But as the hull slid under
the surface Comet II was already being planned. It was 81ft long and had
a 30-horsepower engine, carrying a piper as part of the six-man crew.
Comet II sank with considerable loss of life in a collision with the
steamer Ayr off Greenock on October 21, 1825.
But the travelling public weren't put off steam. The ''Doon the
water'' tradition was established on the Clyde, and as paddles beat
among the Hebrides Henry Bell became the owner of Europe's first
steamship company. At the same time his wife Margaret kept the
restorative waters flowing in the Baths Inn, Helensburgh, bringing in an
income to support her temperamental, debt-burdened husband who had to
fight till the end for acknowledgement -- and financial recognition --
of his achievement.
Isambard Kingdom Brunel, of Great Eastern notoriety, provided the
Scottish entrepreneur's epitaph between puffs at his cigar. ''Bell did
what we engineers failed in. He gave us the sea steamer; his scheming
was Britain's steaming.'' Brian Osborne's knowledgeable biography,
beautifully produced by Argyll Publishing, takes the reader on a
fascinating voyage of discovery.

WARRIORS AND PRIESTS: The History of The Clan Maclean 1300-1570
Nicholas Maclean-Bristol
Tuckwell Press, #19.95
THE Scottish clans were eventually exterminated, like rats in
tenements, and just as they should have been for there is no doubt that
the inhabitants of the clan system were a danger to any level of a
civilised nation. I write this not with irony, but with every notion of
a sad truth. Was well that the Highland savage went.
A pity though that the chiefs of the clans didn't as well, for they
were the king rats, and Scotland would have been the better for the
extirpation of its nobles. Do not ask me to sup at a table with a
Highland lord: I would as well dine with a Balkan suzerain -- he would
have as much blood on his hands, but less of an English accent. And so
it is with my own clan. The clan Maclean.
In common with other clans the Macleans claim to go back to the
Pharaohs of Egypt. Certainly the Declaration of Arbroath insists that
''We came from Upper Sycthia . . . '' which is modern Syria and is
probably true, ''and travelled in many lands''. The Scots settled first
in Iberia in Spain and then in Ireland, which they named Hibernia, both
meaning land of the Hebrew. And the Scots went forth to Scotland, and
the Macleans were originally from Ireland.
They settled in the Western Isles, and eventually made their base in
Mull. A large clan then and larger later. The Macleans' knowledge of
their own ancestry was preserved both orally and in writing and at one
time several versions of the genealogies existed. John Beaton, the last
Senachie of the Macleans of Duart, is known to have possessed the 1467
manuscript which recorded the clans of the West Highlands and Islands,
and which is now in the National Library of Scotland.
So says the chronicler of this extraordinarily tedious book, Nicholas
Maclean-Bristol. The double-barrelled fellow has, the flyleaf states,
studied the history of the clan Maclean for more than 40 years and
''lives in the Hebrides, having restored Breacahadh Castle, the ancient
stronghold of the Macleans of Coll''.
I do not know this double-barrelled chap but I will give you a
guarantee right here and now that he is more Bristol than Maclean. If I
am wrong I will eat my Glengarry. And I'd rather eat a regiment's ration
of them than have to consume this turgid biography of my own clan's
history.
Perhaps this is a trifle unfair. This is a historian's book, and
doubtless sheds much light on one small patch of clan history. It adds
little to the store of any normal person's knowledge, however, and casts
a long shadow on our ignorance. Why and where the Macleans did and
became and ended up would have been interesting to read, but leaf
through this book and you will be assaulted, and insulted, with more
names and codicils than a Highland lawyer can conjure up. The author
stops his lament in the year 1570. Many a time I have been told off
because I don't ''spell my name right''. I will tell you how I became a
small ''C'' and not a ''Mac''. My great grandpapa couldn't write his
name so a Lowlander spelled his name for him. There you are. His
Christian name was Hector. He couldn't spell that either. He is not in
this book of course, and one wonders why really. I mean, why finish off
in 1570? The Macleans were finished off long years back in their islands
and have furnished the world ever since as the other clans have done.
Just think of all those marvellous Macleans still around. Sorley, Sir
Fitzroy, Una -- even the late Lex. Ach tae hell with it -- there were
three Jack McLeans. One was the golf professional at Gleneagles. One was
the owner of the Bowling Inn. And then there was me.

MEET THE AUTHOR
HE says with a grin: ''Beginnings are always difficult. You know there
must have been a beginning but what you say is the beginning may not be
the beginning at all. Logic tells you there has to be one so you make
one, whether it is true or not is another matter.''
Umberto Eco was being suitably elliptical. He was also telling the
truth.
''I suppose it is true to say that having written about books and
culture, about ideas and mystery I wanted to write about something
substantial. Who doesn't? So, it started with nature. But there was no
beginning, as in a symphony. There was just a development of ideas.''
He was on a promotional tour for his new novel. The Island of the Day
Before is Eco's third novel, which he was to read and discuss that night
to an audience of around 750 in the Assembly Rooms. The previous night
he had read to 800 people with more than 200 overflow in Manchester, and
the following evening he was reading in the Queen Elizabeth Hall,
London, with Mario Vargas Llosa and Salman Rushdie.
The Island of the Day Before looks like joining The Name of the Rose
as an international best seller. Almost everyone who attended the
readings bought at least one copy which Eco patiently signed. Three days
previously he had been in Spain; this was Edinburgh. He was warm,
relaxed and chatty, though I was first in a queue of journalists lined
up for an interview.
''It is remarkable,'' he said. ''These things take a long time to
complete and I hold on because I don't want to finish. It is a game for
me, a puzzle I set myself which I have to solve then when it's gone I
get back to what is, for me, a normal existence.''
The idea of a slowly developing story whose meaning may be obscure,
but which nevertheless retains a momentum as well as a narrative
coherence is apposite. The Island of the Day Before defies summary. It
is informative, erudite and playful. It turns on itself, starts, stops,
and shifts in a way fiction is not supposed to be able to do, has no
linear structure yet conveys its story clearly. As we have come to
expect of Eco, it is about a number of certainties and uncertainties.
But the clear and cumulative effect is of a mind in collapse, of a man
who becomes crazy through marginal experiences, who develops and
discards great ideas without understanding, and who is fascinated by his
own position in a void on the edge of infinity.
To reach safety he must travel through time and space.
It is the story of a young nobleman, Roberto della Griva, whose
marooned on a deserted ship which becomes stranded near an island which
is geographically close, but a day away in time, since he has to cross
the international dateline to get there. The novel moves backward and
forward in time, taking memories and events as random happenings.
''It was my problem, my puzzle. I knew he had to get to the island,
but didn't know what to do to get him there,'' Eco says.
Roberto believes he is shadowed by an elder brother called Ferrante,
whom he blames for his misfortune. The ship has maps, food and
accommodation but is without longboats. He cannot swim and lives in fear
of the rats he hears at night, entertaining himself by recalling the
events which brought him here while analysing the problem of why the
boat is deserted.
He uses the paper and ink he finds to converse with himself,
discovering that life on board ship is a world unlike our own, but there
are echoes and eventual connections between one and the other. He fills
his journal with a variety of opinions, theories and experiments he has
witnessed, as well as accounts of a number of events which have shaped
his life, an unrequited love affair, a period spent in the Bastille and
an account of the Seige of Casale.
Eco discovered two documents on the seige, one written in Italian, the
other Spanish, which told him what was happening on both sides every
day. He then bought a map which showed the position of the armies,
commanders and troops. From this he constructed a detailed account of
events which Roberto dismisses as a chapter in ''a meaningless
history''. These events, theories, alchemaic practices, theological
discourses and cookery tips may or may not be important. Roberto cannot
decide but the reader is carried on a tide of exuberant brilliance which
includes references to events and texts, including Eco's own, which do
not exist and a novel-within-a-novel all of which is related in a
translation by William Weaver which reads like an original text.
''It is brilliant,'' said Eco. ''He did what I ask every translator to
do. I tell them to use the literary tradition of their country; if they
find a better metaphor or quotation to insert it. I send them my notes,
my images, texts and drawings of the islands, maps, machines,
everything.''
And for all Eco's love of contemporary culture he refuses to
acknowledge that a film would work and has already turned down a number
of offers. ''I made that mistake before,'' he said. ''The film was fine,
but different. Now it must come at the end, when the book has been read.
Only then should there be a film, only then can it find a new
audience.''

DOG COLLAR DIARY
Alexander Cameron
House of Lochar, #14.95
The Rev Alexander Cameron commences his latest volume of
autobiography: ''Ever since my two books Vet in the Vestry and Poultry
in the Pulpit did far better than an ordinary person like me could ever
expect . . . I have been asked frequently when the next one was
coming.'' He is, as you will have gathered, both a qualified vet and an
ordained minister (Church of Scotland), and in these pages he continues
what his publisher describes as a ''gentle, humorous tour through his
eventful life''.
The trouble is that the book tries to be two things at once. It tries
to be a rustic yarn, in the tradition of James Herriot. (But Cameron is
not nearly as good a writer as Herriot.) Yet it also tries to be a
Christian book, of the kind that you never see in mainstream bookstores,
with a religiosity which will disconcert those not used to it.
Thus a book that uncomfortably juggles quick fixes for milk fever with
perfervid hopes of a Second Coming. Even I kept wincing. On reading the
accompanying press-release, I was not surprised to find that Cameron's
writing sells largely to journals like Life and Work and The People's
Friend.
Adverbs, exclamation marks, a weakness for quoting couthy dialogue,
patronising anecdotes, twee morality -- and much sheer bad writing --
weaken potential home-runs like Cameron's night in the middle of the
Lockerbie disaster. This -- honestly -- is how Cameron records the
response of a doctor in the Town Hall that night when the minister
puffed in to ask how he could help. ''He replied, 'We don't know yet
what we are going to find but it looks as if there will be many
casualties who will come here initially. But meantime maybe you can help
to reassure the old folks and others who have been hurriedly evacuated
from their homes dressed just as they had been sitting, and others who,
in the confusion, have been separated from their partners and feel
totally lost'.''
Thus Cameron -- reporting speech in the style of badly translated
Danish pornography -- flunks at the start of what should be epic drama.
That brick, and many others, reflect less badly on him than on the
editors at House of Lochar.
He even reproduces sermons, complete with divine theme and three
heads. There is a relentless, egotistical quality to much of the book; a
ministerial career recalled in obsessive detail, just as vain as Murdo
Ewen MacDonald, if less interesting. Yet the insulting thumb-portraits
of amusing yokels show no pastoral concern.
Alexander Cameron, who is probably a nice man, gives an undemanding
read for some snowy night beside the fire, if you're replete with
stovies and fond of Ovaltine.

IT will soon be 10 years since he made his debut for Celtic, a
17-year-old with such an exciting potential that he not only impressed
at his first try, but in no time at all was a fixture in the Parkhead
defence.
Derek Whyte may not have fulfilled the prophecies of some of his
biggest fans of those days, but he is doing not too badly at all in the
Premiership in England, where he has become a fixture again, this time
in the Middlesbrough defence.
Just as there were queues of seers making lavish predictions for his
future when he was a teenager, there was no shortage of detractors,
maybe some of them the same people, when he left for Middlesbrough in
the summer of 1992.
Whyte had suffered from the general decline at Celtic Park, the
changes of manager, the boardroom uncertainties, and the overall malaise
that was to taint the club for years before and after his departure.
Even so, he had rarely been out of the first team during Liam Brady's
first season, but became aware that he was surplus to requirements early
the following term.
''People tend to forget that I was only a teenager when I went into
the Celtic first team and as a result think I am a lot older than I
am.''
He might not have been too enamoured at the time he left, but then,
when a Celtic fan discovers he is not needed at the place he has
cherished, it would hardly be surprising if there was not a touch of
resentment.
''Maybe there was a wee bit bitterness at the time, but that is all
gone now,'' he says, ''because you get to realise that is just the way
it is in football. Celtic didn't have much money and I hadn't cost the
club anything. So they would be grateful for the #900,000 they got for
me. Any new manager has different ideas and, to be honest, I was quite
realistic about it all.''
Whyte is much more resentful of the attitude some north of the Border
aficionados have towards his current club. ''It disappoints me when I
hear people up there dismiss Middlesbrough. When there was talk of John
Collins coming here there were some folk in Scotland talking down the
club. They should come down here and have a look at the new stadium, the
facilities, and the attendances. They might get a shock.''
Whyte seemed to disappear from prominence, none the less, when he
moved south three years ago, and the promising career at international
level which had been anticipated did not materialise, although he has
had four of his eight full caps with Midlesbrough.
The man himself would point out that he had no problems settling in
the south, became a regular in their team immediately, and found the
football and lifestyle to his liking.
He had learned a lot about the north east of England club from Tony
Mowbray who had made the journey in reverse, and the fact that he and
wife Wilma -- as well as daughter Chelsey, who is now five and has a
10-month-old younger brother Cruze -- joined him almost immediately in a
new house eased the transition.
''The team were doing very well, in about sixth or seventh place in
the league, when we struck a run of injuries. There was not much money
here then and the squad was not very big. At the end of the season we
got relegated.''
Whyte was left out of the side for a couple of games when new manager
Bryan Robson bought a new centre half, but was back in the fold in short
time and never looked back.
Now, of course, he is very much a leading player in the revival that
has seen the club, under Robson, win promotion, reach up to the dizzy
heights of fourth place in the Premiership, rekindle the latent
fanaticism at Ayresome Park, and build the much admired all-seated
Riverside Stadium.
The rise and rise of Boro was perhaps even more dramatically
demonstrated by the signing of #4.5m Brazilian wonder boy Juninho, who
appeared at the new stadium during the week to be greeted by more than
4000 fans.
''That signing has made everybody excited, nobody more so than the
rest of us in the dressing room. When he came to train with us for the
first time there was a real buzz about the place.''
How did the young Brazilian look? ''He was fantastic. He is so slight,
and only about 5ft 5ins, but what a player he is. We couldn't get near
him.
''I think this is the signing that has made the whole football world
sit up and notice Middlesbrough. He is a like a jockey, but his ability
is astonishing.
''We are not sure what we will call him -- some of us thought Frankie,
after Dettori, would have been ideal, but we might settle for Junior,
which is what we are told his name stands for.''
Juninho is not due to appear in the Boro colours until next weekend,
if his clearance has gone through from Brazil, but the signing will make
it all the more difficult to get tickets for the Boro home games.
Already, according to Whyte, the team is playing to 30,000 sell-outs
regularly.
''One of the reasons I came here was because people told me that the
potential to be something big was here. Now it is beginning to come
about and I am glad to be part of it.''
He would not be human if he did not feel that he should have been
given a little more recognition by Scotland, but accepts that national
managers have their own ideas and, in any case, was reintroduced to the
fold in the B team in Sweden last week.
''I would love to be involved with the national side again, especially
in the European finals down here. I was in the squad the last time we
were in the finals but didn't play. Even then I thought it was
tremendous.
''I think that the fact the club were relegated and were not in the
spotlight doesn't do your chances much help, but now that Middlesbrough
are in the Premiership and getting such a high profile with Bryan
Robson, it can only be good for me.''
He plays one of the three centre-back roles in the system favoured by
the former Manchester United and England star but did not find that too
daunting as he hd done it on a number of occasions with Celtic.
Whyte, who played a few games for Celtic Boys' Club before he moved
upwards, is still a fan of his old team and is unlikely ever to change.
''I don't get up to see them too often. Whenever I get the chance I am
there. It is only two-and-a-half hours from here up the road, after
all.''
He, Wilma, and the children live in Yarn, a quiet, typically English
village nine miles outside Middlesbrough and have made many friends.
Derek has plenty of ambitions left to keep his desire going.
''First, I have to hold down my place in the Middlesbrough team;
secondly, I would dearly like to be in the Scotland squad.'' Otherwise,
he is a happy young man doing what he does well, maybe better than at
any time since he first appeared in a Celtic shirt.
Would he come back north? ''Nothing is ever certain in this game, but
I don't know if I would like to play for anybody up there, after having
played for Celtic. I think I would prefer to finish my playing days down
here, I enjoy it so much.
''I think the biggest difference from playing here and in Scotland is
the variety of clubs and grounds we go to. It makes it very interesting
and different, whereas up there we play each other so many times.''
'Scots who dismiss Middlesbrough should come down here and have a look
at the new stadium, the facilities, and the attendances. They might get
a shock'

For actor Neil Pearson, a part in the blockbusting new drama Rhodes
was a dream realised. Allan Laing talks to him on set about the
larger-than-life characters who took a continent and shaped it by
dubiuos, bur dazzlingly adventurous means
IT IS a historical drama serial of epic proportions. With exotic
foreign locations, a cast of many thousands, and a production budget
equal to the GDP of a small Central American republic, Rhodes is the
biggest thing the BBC has done in years. Indeed, it's probably the most
ambitious British television project since Jewel in the Crown.
But for Neil Pearson it is more than even that. It is a heaven-sent
opportunity for the actor to return to his childhood games. ''It's
odd,'' he says. ''On the one hand it feels very, very grown up
professionally. Here you are and you're on a horse with this huge cast
in this huge country. And still, at the same time, it is extremely
childish. It's exactly what I was doing 30 years ago -- cowboys and
Indians -- only this time there's a #10m budget.
''When you're up there in the saddle, wearing your big leather hat and
your long coat, and you're leading 100 men into battle, it is difficult
not to giggle.'' You could have taken the words straight from General
Custer's mouth.
Pearson, sporting an unfamiliar moustache commensurate with the
serial's vast scale, is sitting in a Johannesburg apartment, his
temporary home for the duration of the shoot. When he returns to London
in November he'll have been away for six long months. No time off for
good behaviour (well, except for the occasional weekend flight back to
England).
To be honest, Johannesburg is not the liveliest of urban sprawls. It
is a soulless city of office blocks and American-style shopping malls.
Your classic desert with windows. A bit like Chipping Norton, says
Pearson. So it can get a tad boring?
''Well, I'm usually very good at filling my own time but, I have to
say, this has stretched my abilities. It'll be nice to get back home.
When I do I plan to lie down in a darkened room for a long time,'' he
explains.
Mind you, Pearson's presence in South Africa is testimony to how far
the nation has come in the last few years. Like any decent human being,
the Battersea-born-and-bred actor (who has impeccable Socialist
credentials) wouldn't have been seen dead there under the old apartheid
regime. But Nelson Mandela changed everything.
''There is obviously still a lot to be done. You don't get over
decades of oppression with a year of democracy. God knows we in Britain
have had democracy a lot longer than that and still we've got problems.
But South Africa is an immensely encouraging place,'' he explains.
Neil Pearson, in addition to being what every woman wants
(apparently), has the distinction of being one of only two British
actors who have done justice to that rare breed of television hero --
the hard-nosed, sails-a-bit-close-to-the-wind, East London cop.
First there was John Thaw as Inspector Jack Regan in The Sweeney.
''Can you make a face on that, George?'' he'd ask his sidekick Carter as
the pair of them sat in the Flying Squad-issue Ford Consul, staking out
a villain's gaff.
Then we had to wait a generation for Pearson to come along as
Superintendent Tony Clark in Between The Lines. ''Can you make a face on
that, George?'' he'd ask his sidekick Naylor as the pair of them sat in
the CIB-issue Vauxhall Cavalier, staking out a bent copper's gaff. Some
things, it seems, never change.
Rhodes, a nine-hour, eight-part, serial being made by the independent
Zenith for the BBC, features Martin Shaw in the title role. Cecil Rhodes
was 19th Century Southern Africa's hero and villain. He did much to
shape the destiny of the Dark Continent (making himself a fortune in the
process) but, like most of his kind, class, and time, he was a
monumental racist.
Rhodes, it transpires, was part of a dubious double act. While he was
indulging in political power-broking in smoke-filled rooms, a
historically less well-known accomplice, a Scots-born adventurer, was
conquering the veld on his behalf.
Leander Starr Jameson was the youngest of 11 children born to a
distinguished Edinburgh family. At the age of seven, they moved to
Sudbury, near London. He qualified as a doctor and went on to take up a
senior position at (and, in fact, run) University College Hospital. But,
with the blood of the wandering Scot coursing through his veins, he
chucked it and set sail for Southern Africa at the age of 25.
He joined a medical partnership in the tough diamond mining-community
of Kimberley where he met and became firm friends with Rhodes, at the
time a leading local figure and aspiring politician in the Cape Colony.
As Rhodes grew in stature, so too did Jameson. He was daring, audacious,
and witty. ''He is universally acknowledged to have been a real
charmer,'' says Pearson, who plays him in the serial and who,
coincidently, is universally acknowledged as being a real charmer.
''Of course, being a charmer is not necessarily the same as being a
nice man,'' he adds, thoughtfully. Though in Pearson's case, it does.
''He and Rhodes were kindred spirits. Jameson was the youngest of 11
kids which probably explains why he was such a high flyer and
over-achiever.
''He became an adventurer and a colonialist. In the name of Britain he
painted the Continent red -- which is not just the colour they used for
the Empire on the map. While Rhodes was negotiating, Jameson was out in
the field securing the territory for him. It's true that, by today's
standards and by any left-wing political standards, what these guys did
was -- and remains -- horrendous.''
Horrendous? Well, Jameson was at one point dispatched (to what later
became Southern Rhodesia) to use his natural charm in an attempt to woo
the great Matabele chief, Lobengula, whose permission was needed for
Rhodes' company to prospect for minerals in the area.
The actor says: ''So what he did was he treated Lobengula for gout
which had arisen from the drink the chief had been plied with in
previous unsuccessful attempts to persuade him. But Jameson gave him
morphine which, of course, has never been and never will be used in the
treatment of gout. And the only reason he administered it was because he
knew it would make him compliant -- turn him into a junkie.
''By any standards that is a near psychotic act but you have to
transfer yourself back to the time in which these men lived. If an act
has enough support from the people around who believe that the means
justify the end, then it becomes a social more. These guys were supposed
to be civilising the world. Of course we know now that it was
objectionable behaviour,'' he says.
Pearson, understandably, has had to leave his own personal political
baggage behind when playing the role of Jameson. He thinks little of the
character's achievements but he admits that what he did was an
extraordinary human feat.
Jameson, who survived Rhodes, rose to become Prime Minister of the
Cape Colony in 1904. However, he is possibly best remembered for a
glorious failure, an act of aggression which is covered in some detail
in the serial (and very exciting it is too).
Pearson explains: ''As his relationship with Rhodes continued over the
years, Jameson came to believe more and more that he could act
unilaterally. There was a coming together of forces who were on Rhodes's
side and wanted change against the forces on the side of President
Kruger of the South African Republic (the Boers) who were against
reform.
''Now Jameson and Rhodes thought they could foment unrest among the
Uitlanders, the mainly British mining population who had been
consistently down-trodden by the Boers. They wanted them to rise up
against Kruger and thereby destroy all oppositon to Rhodes' expansion.
But Jameson jumped the gun. The Uitlanders were not as united as he
thought they were and he started this revolution only to discover that
he was in a minority of one.''
In what became known as Jameson's Raid, the adventurer marched his
forces across the Transvaal border only to be easily routed by Boer
Commando forces. Jameson was captured and imprisoned.
''He was only saved from the death penalty by his friends and
political allies,'' adds Pearson. ''The raid was cataclysmic and did for
Rhodes who never really fully recovered his reputation. It certainly put
back his ambitions. Jameson managed to live long enough -- and do enough
good work -- to enable people to forget and he went on to have a
successful political career.''
To appreciate the scope of Rhodes it is worth considering the fact
that there is a cast of some 10,000 extras (mostly local tribesmen).
There are also no fewer than 168 speaking parts. The production involved
the creation of an entire town -- 19th Century Kimberley -- on a site in
the middle of the bush about an hour's drive from Johannesburg.
''It is absolutely vast in scale. I mean, we took part in this
enormous battle scene which took three days to shoot. And I think it
lasts for just two minutes on the screen. The armourer informed us that
we used about 22,000 rounds of ammunition during the battle,'' says the
actor.
He also recalls the day when they almost lost the village in a blaze.
''Because the place gets so tinder dry, bush fires are a common
occurence. We were really lucky on the day that fire threatened the set
because there were 300 extras there. If it had been an intimate day when
there were maybe only three or four actors around then they whole thing
could have been screwed.
''As it was the extras formed human chains with water buckets. There
was a little damage and we had to put the shooting back. The main
problem was trying to shoot around the damage. Although the earth
regenerates quickly around here there was still a lot of burned ground
which the cameras had to avoid.''
Pearson's sojourn in post-Apartheid South Africa has been a revelation
for him. ''What I find most encouraging is the complete lack of a sense
of vengeance. And that comes directly from Mandela. If I had spent 27
years wrongly in prison then I would come out looking to shoot people. I
wouldn't be proud of it and I would try to control it but that's how I
would feel. But he has never shown that sort of vengefulness.
''Within a year of him taking office, the death penalty had been
abolished. What's happened is that, since Nelson Mandela hasn't shown
any personal tendancy to vengeance, then no one else has the moral
authority to show it themselves. And the result is that South Africa is
a far more optimistic place. God knows it has its problems but the
process is irreversible,'' he adds.
Pearson, an intelligent and very amiable man, is a gypsy actor. He's a
''have script, will travel'' kind of thesp who's only really happy when
he's on the move. This year it's South Africa; last year it was
Scotland. Re-united with his Between The Lines co-star Siobhan Redmond
in Liz Lockhead's Tartan Short, Latin For A Dark Room.
''I loved that. We filmed in Edinburgh and Glasgow and we only had a
week. Every penny counted and we made sure that it all went on the
screen. Liz is a fabulous writer and a fabulous poet. I think the short
film format suited her style. It is the natural hunting ground of the
poet because, like poetry, you have to condense your thoughts and
feelings into very small prismic images,'' he says.
Pearson, of course, is best remembered for the aforementioned Between
The Lines, a superior cop series if ever there was one. However, the
curious thing is that, although the programme was critically acclaimed
and won awards by the barrowload, it didn't exactly set the heather on
fire in terms of viewing figures.
''Well, I suppose it could have been Heartbeat which gets an audience
of 15 million. But we got 8.5 million and, as far as I'm concerned,
that's an awful lot of people to be watching you on television,'' he
comments. ''It could have been higher -- if we'd put in screaming car
chases and shot more people. But I like to think there's still an
audience that doesn't want to be patronised and wants to be credited
with a brain and intelligence.''
Though Between The Lines is definitely dead and dropped (on account of
the fact that Superintendent Clark copped it in the last episode),
Pearson's other familiar television role -- as the wandering-trousers
news-sub Dave Charnley in Drop The Dead Donkey -- is very much alive.
''Everyone seems to know more about it than I do but when last I heard
there were plans for a fifth series coming out around this time next
year,'' he says.

LEG-SPINNER Anil Kumble completed a match haul of 9-120 and opener
Ajay Jadeja hit 73 as India trounced New Zealand by eight wickets in the
first Test yesterday in Bangalore.
Kumble exploited uneven bounce on his home ground to return
second-innings figures of 5-81 and India, after dismissing New Zealand
for 233, won with two days to spare.
Jadeja's dashing 73 off 92 balls contained twelve 4s. He put on 101
with fellow opener Manoj Prabhakar (43), Sanjay Manjrekar (29 not out)
completing the job at 151 for two.
India's captain Mohammad Azharuddin was man-of-the-match for his
first-innings 87.
New Zealand, 125-5 overnight, lost Chris Cairns to paceman Javagal
Srinath in the first over. Kumble then removed Stephen Fleming for 41.
Dion Nash added 39 for the eighth wicket with Lee Germon, who, leading
the Kiwis on his Test debut, scored a fighting 41 in a 96-minute stay
before falling lbw to Kumble.
Hart offered a late flourish with an unbeaten 27 before Kumble
accounted for last man Danny Morrison.

DAVID Coulthard grabbed provisional pole position for the Pacific
Grand Prix on his Aida debut yesterday -- and immediately led a chorus
of criticism of the circuit.
Coulthard celebrated his first appearance on the Japanese track by
spearheading a Williams Renault one-two, finishing one-tenth of a second
ahead of team-mate Damon Hill.
The 24-year-old Scot clocked one minute 14.182 seconds to see off a
late challenge from Hill, with world champion Michael Schumacher, who
led for much of the session, forced into third place in 1-14.524.
''This is the dustiest track of any we have raced on,'' said the
Scottish driver of a circuit which is hosting it's second Grand Prix.
Argentina was dusty, but at least if you ran wide you were on grass or a
kerb. Here, if you run wide you're on dust.
''I am sure tomorrow will be quicker. I just hope that the positions
are the same.''
Fellow Williams driver Hill was content with second place on the
provisional grid for a race he must win -- and hope Schumacher doesn't
collect at least three points -- if the title battle is to continue.
''Whatever happens to Michael is out of my hands, so my approach to
the race is very straightforward -- I have to win it,'' Hill added.
He echoed Coulthard's complaints about the track, saying: ''At the
moment it's just like a beach. There is lots of dust and as soon as
anyone goes off he brings it back on to the track.''
Departing Ferrari duo Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger finished fourth
and fifth respectively, followed by a trio of Brits who were separated
by less than two tenths of a second.
Benetton's Johnny Herbert led his fellow countrymen with sixth place
(1-15.561), followed by McLaren's Mark Blundell (1-15.652) and Eddie
Irvine of Jordan (1-15.696).
Herbert and Blundell have both been axed by their teams and are
looking to produce a good performance in the Japanese double header to
boost their chances of finding a drive for next season.

BRITAIN'S Richard Burns and co-driver Robert Reid recorded the fastest
times on the final two stages in the Hong Kong-Beijing Rally yesterday,
but were unable to improve on their third place in the week-long
marathon.
Swede Kenneth Eriksson won the rally and the Asia-Pacific Championship
along with Staffan Parmander -- regardless of the result of the final
event in the six-round series, in Thailand in December.
But Burns was still pleased with his final time of 4hr 42min 42sec,
after having started slowly and then lost more than two minutes when he
slid off the road on day two in his Subaru 555 Impreza.
''This is a unique event,'' he said. ''It is as much about the battle
to get the car from Hong Kong to Beijing as it is about being fastest on
the stages.''
Eriksson and Parmander finished in 4-39-28, ahead of Finn Ari Vatanen
and Italian Fabrizia Pons, also in a Mitsubishi Lancer, in 4-40-04.
''It feels fantastic,'' said Eriksson. ''I have wanted this victory
for three years. We worked hard as a team and did a professional job. We
learnt a lot from last year.''
Of the 44 cars which set out on October 14 from Hong Kong, 27 finished
the 2313-mile race.

IT TOOK an extra end at the conclusion of the first day of
competition, but late last night Gordon Muirhead's Scottish champions
brought the Stranraer bandwagon of Hammy McMillan to a halt -- at least
temporarily -- with an 8-5 victory in the first day of round-robin play
in the European qualifying competition at Hamilton Ice Rink.
This weekend's event will determine Scotland's representatives at the
European Championships in December -- with McMillan the defending
champion -- and this showdown left Douglas Dryburgh alone with an
undefeated record after three rounds of play, his 9-4 victory over
Struan MacNee giving him a 3-0 record.
In the other men's game last night, Warwick Smith recorded his first
victory of the event, beating Robin Gray by 8-7 and leaving his opponent
alone without a win so far.
McMillan, Muirhead, and MacNee each has a 2-1 record behind Dryburgh
in the hunt for tomorrow's semi-final slots.
In women's play, Debbie Knox followed up her opening 7-5 defeat of
Scottish champion Kirsty Hay with a convincing 7-1 win over Carolyn
Hutchison. In the other second-round game, Hay beat Rhona Martin by 7-2
for her first victory so far.

PAINFULLY RICH: J PAUL GETTY AND HIS HEIRS
John Pearson
MacMillian #17.50
WHEN I regularly ask what my father will leave me in his will, as all
good but wise sons do, he replies, simply the debt to bury him. After
reading John Pearson's collection of clippings on J Paul Getty,
Painfully Rich, I can think of no greater gift. Getty's billion accrued
from oilfields, stretched out like a noose, long before the old man
tightened it by turning in his grave.
To his drug-addicted son John Paul Getty he left but $500 from his own
will upon his death in 1976, yet Getty received a four-way share of his
grandmother's trust which, under the penny-pinching guidance of her son,
reached just short of one billion dollars. A small sum for such a long
legacy of family dysfunction, including mental illness, alcoholism, drug
addiction, and neglect. Even a brief glance makes you feel in the pink
to be poor.
It is cruel to insult the old but J Paul Getty was a cruel man whose
veins did not pump blood but ice, lagged by money. Getty was a generous
man only in depositing each divorced wife with a son whom he seldom saw.
Timothy, son of his fifth wife, Lousie Dudley, died aged 12, begging his
father to visit.
You could fill a book with Getty's meanness. Yet what Pearson lacks in
original facts, insights, and exclusive interviews, he hurdles over in
vision. Painfully Rich is also the story of the human spirit's recovery
through the smog of unlimited wealth.
The three strange heroes of the dynasty are: J Paul Getty jun, an
alcoholic and drug addict who lost 20 years in a morass of self-pity,
guilt, and deep despair; a man who lost his second wife from overdose in
still unclear circum-stances. His son Paul Getty, who after the horrors
of losing an ear during the four-month hostage ordeal, sank into drink
and drugs until he hit rock-bottom, slumping into a coma only to awake
paralysed. And J Paul jun's daughter Aileen, who contracted Aids. Faith,
hope and charity saved all three from a consuming nihilism.
J Paul Getty reinvented himself from a London clinic as a
cricket-loving philanthropist. A #50m donation to the National Gallery
earned him a knighthood.
Paul Getty through the agony of muscle spasms and the cell his body
became, found a will to live he never possessed when able-bodied. He
joined with his father and helped organise a birthday party which
reunited every member of the fractured family. Aileen is still alive,
five years after developing full-blown Aids, and running a support group
and fighting for the rights of fellow patients.
John Pearson's biography is neither brilliantly written, nor
exhaustive, so much remains to be known. It does, however, provide a
valuable lesson. If there is anything to learn from the sad saga of
Getty's poor-little-rich-kids it is more than that money will not buy
happiness. It is the simpler concept: that what is not given, is lost.

A NEW scheme to encourage farmers and landowners to become more
involved in countryside conservation was given the full support
yesterday of Lord Lindsay, the Scottish Office Minister for Agriculture.
At a gathering of several leading Scottish personalities in farming
and conservation at Kilconquhar, East Fife, on the doorstep of his own
farm he said: ''Do as I do. Conservation is not a luxury it is a
necessity.''
David Ball, chief executive of Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group
(FWAG) Scotland, who launched the Landwise initiative, said the work
started 26 years ago encouraging farmers, crofters and woodland owners
to manage their poorer corners of land had moved dramatically forward.
''We have moved from the fringe of farming to the mainstream of
agriculture offering whole farm systems and the environmental
consequences of this.
''This is advice on technical management to farmers large and small,
upland and lowland and we want large land managers to take advantage of
our advisory availability.''
Prior to the launch, Lord Lindsay had proudly shown a group of
environment lobby leaders how he has put into practice what FWAG advice
offers.
At Incharvie Farm he showed them round part of eight kilometres of
beetle banks. These are two to three-metre wide strips of grass that
break up large fields and serve three purposes.
First and foremost they provide over-wintering conditions for various
species of beetles, including ladybirds, which during cereal growing
season feed on the aphid pests that would otherwise need pesticide
treatment.
They also provide habitat for voles and mice for local birds of prey,
including barn owls which have only recently returned to take up
residence at Incharvie farm buildings and they act as windbreaks to
reduce soild erosion on exposed fields.
''This is part of the ecosystem I have developed in the last five
years and, because we don't spray near to these banks, we have reduced
chemical costs, but yields are no different,'' he said.
Back at the FWAG launch of Landwise he emphasised that farmers had to
remain viable if they were to increase their involvement in
conservation.
''The Scottish landscape we enjoy is due to hundreds of years of
farmers and woodland owners who have given it to us. They are custodians
-- not just out there to make as money as they can -- and they
understand the need to keep the land in good heart and recognise that
the countryside cannot be seen in purely utilitarian terms.''
He said consumers today demanded to know more about what they were
buying, whether it be safety from pesticide residue or the issue of
animal welfare, but they had to be aware of the producer's input into
environmental care.
''We do not want a countryside that is a theme park or a museum. The
farmer must be farming his ground, earning his money and funding the
type of countryside we want.
''We must remember that for the 60,000 jobs involved in farming there
are another 140,000 reliant on agriculture.
''Farmers cannot be expected to be conservation experts and many would
welcome practical help. The philosophy of FWAG is to combine efficient
agriculture with care of the environment and this is line with
Government thinking and the direction of agricultural policy.''
David Ball said that Landwise was not a programme of advice only on
the use of fertilisers and pesticides but the prospect of overall farm
planning. He said the scheme is supported by the Scottish Agricultural
College and Scottish Natural Heritage.

DARWIN'S DANGEROUS IDEA: Evolution and the Meanings of Life
Daniel C Dennett
Allen Lane The Penguin Press, #25
NOBODY was more disturbed by Darwinism than Darwin himself. When he
returned to England, to study specimens collected on the voyage of the
Beagle, he confided his concerns to a secret notebook begun in July
1837. Contemplating mass extinctions, Darwin came to an alarming
conclusion. If animals adapted to a changing geological environment,
then the origin and survival of species was accidental. ''It is
absurd,'' Darwin noted, ''to talk of one animal being higher than
another.'' Darwin realised his theory, once published, would mean the
fall of man from God's grace as traditionally understood.
Evolution, not theology, explained everything, even the religious
impulse: ''Love of deity (is) effect of organisation, oh you
Materialist!'' he told himself. Man arrogantly assumed he was set above
other animals by a divine creator but was, in fact, ''created from
animals''. Looking at class divisions in society he felt the environment
could be adjusted to improve the condition of the poor: ''Educate all
classes, improve the women . . . and mankind must improve.'' Darwin
offered artificial evolution as an alternative to social revolution.
After reading Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population, Darwin
decided the cut-throat competition of capitalism was an animal activity
capable of reform, also that the similarity between natural and
artificial selection was the most ''beautiful'' part of his theory. In
1842 -- when the country was paralysed by a general strike called by the
Chartists -- Darwin quit London for the country quiet of an old
parsonage in Kent. That year he revealed his secret, how all animals are
descended from common stocks, in a letter to his friend Joseph Dalton
Hooker: ''I am almost convinced (quite contrary to the opinion I started
with) that species are not (it is like confessing to a murder)
immutable''.
Adaptive evolution, Darwin was still afraid to admit publicly,
murdered the religious majesty of man.
Not until 1859, some 20 years after he had formulated his theory, did
Darwin publish Origin of Species. Sending a copy to A R Wallace, he
remarked: ''God knows what the public will think.'' As he anticipated,
Darwin was pilloried by the popular press and praised by scientists; a
figure of fun to Tory traditionalists and a figure of fear to religious
fundamentalists, he was loved by liberal thinkers.
Ironically, the agnostic Darwin was buried with ecclesiastical pomp in
Westminster Abbey. After his death Darwin was regarded as a deity,
Darwinism revered as a dogma.
Anyone who attacked Darwin after his death risked ridicule. Stanley
Kramer's movie Inherit the Wind (1960), based on the notorious 1925
Scopes monkey trial, made a monkey out of opponents of evolution.
Richard Milton won few friends and influenced not a lot of people when
he contended, in The Facts of Life (1992), ''the Darwinian idea is
powerful and beautiful (but) the theory cannot be true''. Tough theory
to test.
Daniel C Dennett is tough on anyone unable to accept Darwinism. Tough
on transformational linguist Noam Chomsky for arguing that language
competence is an innate gift, not a product of natural selection: ''The
language organ, Chomsky thought, was not an adaptation, but . . . a
mystery, or a hopeful monster.'' Tough on popular scientist Stephen Jay
Gould for endorsing Chomsky's view that language did not evolve but
somehow suddenly arrived as an inexplicable gift, at best a by-product
of the enlargement of the human brain.
Dennett is, above, all, a fan of Darwin: ''If I were to give an award
for the single best idea anyone has ever had, I'd give it to Darwin,
ahead of Newton and Einstein and everyone else. In a single stroke, the
idea of evolution by natural selection unifies the realm of life,
meaning, and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect,
mechanism and physical law. But it is not just a wonderful scientific
idea. It is a dangerous idea. My admiration for Darwin's magnificent
idea is unbounded . . . '' What a fanfare.
For defending the theory of evolution by putting Darwin's ancestral
apes above Bishop Wilberforce's imaginary angels, Thomas Henry Huxley
was nicknamed ''Darwin's bulldog''. For writing this book, Dennett
deserves to be called Darwinian man's best friend. He has Darwin on the
brain. On the mind.
In his influential book The Concept of Mind (1949), Gilbert Ryle
ridiculed dualism as the dogma of the ghost in the machine. In
Consciousness Explained (1991), Dennett renewed the attack on dualism
and compared the mind to a computer, thus replacing the ghost in the
machine with the machine in the machine. As a combative materialist
Dennett thinks the computer metaphor of the mind is valid. Hence, he
argued that consciousness can be explained by accepting an analogy with
a machine operating as an evolved and evolving computer programme
shaping the activities of the brain.
Dennett writes like a machine programmed by the mind of the Darwin on
his brain. Evolution, in Dennett's mind, elevates man above all other
animals: ''Our brains are in effect joined together into a single
cognitive system that dwarfs all others . . . Naked animal brains are no
match at all for the heavily armed and outfitted brains we carry in our
heads.''
No wonder Dennett objects to Gould who, in Eight Little Piggies
(1993), objected to Darwinists who specified the superiority of human
beings. Gould observed a potentially compassionate community of
creatures coming from a common ancestry. Dennett is tough on inhuman
inhabitants of the planet -- spiders who ''can't contemplate the concept
of fishing'', birds who ''aren't up to thinking about democracy''.
Dennett likes to hover in the speculative stratosphere. Ostentatiously
erudite, he is trapped by quasi-scientific terminology just as surely as
a computer is at the mercy of a particular programme.
Computers can calculate but cannot conceptualise. Dennett can
conceptualise and easily calculate how much his attacks on others mean.
Absolutely convinced, so he says, ''that Darwin's idea is a universal
solvent, capable of cutting right to the heart of everything in sight''
he writes as a man of absolute conviction but, since Darwinian life is a
game of chance, our impressively intellectual author is best read as a
lively, stimulating, and superbly game chancer.

* I have been living abroad for some time and on returning was
delighted to find that your questions and answers page is still going
strong. Can you tell me whether there is any publication giving
information about all the personal equity plans (PEPs) which are
available, including comments on how one chooses which one to buy?
* New PEPs are being launched all the time, so it is not easy to keep
completely up to date. But there is a PEP Guide published by independent
financial adviser Chase De Vere Investments which compares almost 1000
schemes.
As for choosing a suitable one, Chase De Vere admits there is a
bewildering array on offer. Within the general PEPs family you can have
your investment managed on your behalf or you can select the investments
yourself. But assuming you want it to be managed for you then clearly
the charges are important, although high charges do not necessarily mean
poor value for money.
If a manager can deliver good investment returns that take account of
its charges, it is a better bet than one which has only modest charges
and an investment record to match. Of course, a good track record is not
a guarantee for the future but it is sensible to take notice of it.
If the performance of a group (not just its PEP business) is
consistently sound over a good number of years, then there is reason to
be confident. Consistency of past performance is more relevant than
short-term results and the investment should be viewed as a
five-year-plus plan.
You will also need to know what your requirements are -- high income,
income plus growth, capital growth, lump sum or regular savings. For a
copy of Chase De Vere's PEP Guide telephone 0800 526092.
* I am a widower aged 56 and will be taking early retirement at the
end of November. I will receive a company pension of #18,500 (index
linked) and a lump sum of about #68,000.
Based on my present commitments I will need an additional income of
approximately #200 to #250 a month on top of my pension. Details of my
present savings and investments are listed on the accompanying sheet.
Some of these investments could be used to generate additional income,
should the need arise, otherwise I would tend to look for some growth.
I have discussed my situation with two independent financial advisers
and a summary of their advice is as follows. For income -- #40,000
invested in a five-year temporary annuity (#13,000) plus associated
investment bond (#27,000) to provide an income of about #250 per month
(Sun Life product); or #40,000 invested in a five-year temporary annuity
(#10,000) plus associated with-profits bond (#30,000) to provide #190 a
month (Friends Provident).
For growth -- #12,000 in M&amp;G PEPs, #6000 in National Savings
index-linked certificates and #10,000 in Allied Dunbar Guaranteed Equity
Bond. I might use the sum invested in the last two to repay my mortgage.
I would be very interested to have your comments on the overall
structure of my savings and investments and, in particular, the advice
relating to the temporary annuity and investment bond combination, the
performance of the management groups concerned and my proposal to use
part of the lump sum to pay off the mortgage.
* The advice you have received appears reasonable and both firms
mentioned have sound track records. However, the advantage in keeping
the mortgage going rather than repaying it is marginal at best.
The return generated by the income suggestions would exceed the
interest cost of the loan after taking account of tax relief but only by
a percentage point or so. Repaying the mortgage would reduce your
outgoings so that a gross return of about 4.8% would be required on the
remaining #50,000 to generate the income required.
You could then put, say, #12,000 into corporate bond PEPs (over two
tax years) plus #10,000 into National Savings Income Bonds and invest
the balance for capital growth through unit trusts or investment trusts,
including part of the portfolio you already have.
Another idea would be to buy a temporary annuity over nine years to
generate income equivalent to the basic state pension so as to give a
seamless transition in income terms. This would free the rest of the
capital for growth.
* My mother who is over 80 years old has #20,000 invested in a
building society and, in addition to interest she receives, a retirement
pension of #3100 and dividends of around #3000 after tax from her
shareholdings. She has been getting a tax rebate for several years of
around #250 to #300 a year.
In these circumstances, can she register to have her building society
interest paid gross so that it is not necessary to submit an annual
repayment claim to the tax office?
* As your mother is over 75 years old she is entitled to the age
allowance of #4800. Her total gross income for tax purposes is, however,
approximately #7850 a year so she is liable to tax, although the amount
deducted at source from her investment income exceeds her liability.
It is only possible to have bank or building society interest paid
gross if you can register as a non-taxpayer. For this your mother's
gross income would have to be less than the amount of her tax
allowances. It will, therefore, be necessary for her to continue making
an annual claim for tax repayment, although depending on when her income
is received it may be possible to make the claim during the tax year
rather than waiting until the end of the year.
* I will be aged 60 next year and under normal circumstances would be
entitled to the state pension. However, my husband and I were divorced
eight years ago and I would like to know what effect this will have on
the amount of pension I can expect to receive. I have been working full
time since the divorce and have been paying the normal rate of national
insurance.
* Pension entitlement is based on national insurance contributions
paid during your working life, and a divorced woman can normally use the
contributions paid by her husband while they were married to augment her
own contribution record if advantageous. Assuming your ex-husband had a
good contribution record, there is no reason why you should not qualify
for the basic state pension when you retire.
The DSS will also take into account the contributions paid by you
since the divorce and any contributions made by you before you were
married. If you write to your local DSS office quoting your national
insurance number, date of birth and giving details of your circumstances
someone will check the records and advise what level of pension will be
payable when you retire. As a guide, the current rate of the basic
pension for a single person is #58.85 per week.
* I sold a batch of shares on April 21 this year through the Share
Centre which now informs me that they were actually worth only
one-sixtieth of the value it quoted to me and that it has mistakenly
paid me 60 times the amount really due.
Since the sale, I have left my job and started a university course,
partly on the strength of the proceeds. Am I legally obliged to repay
the centre as demanded and, if so, can I make a counter-claim against it
for compensation because of the hardship the mistake may well cause me?
* You will have to take legal advice on this one, but in similar cases
where banks credit accounts erroneously the account holder is obliged to
repay the funds, particularly when the error is obvious.
However, in view of the time which has elapsed since the error was
made, the Share Centre would appear to be under some moral obligation to
allow you a measure of compensation for the difficulties its mistake has
made for you.
If you are not satisfied with the response you get, you can always
make a complaint to the Securities and Futures Authority which is the
regulator concerned. You should set out all the relevant facts, and if
the SFA does not take up the case you have the right to put it before an
independent arbitration panel.

Jennifer Cunningham highlights an astute tactic in the battle to house
the National Gallery of Scottish Art and Design in the Post Office at
Glasgow's George Square
THE Post Office likes to refer to its special-edition stamps as art in
miniature and there is an argument that the history of art can be traced
in stamps. That piece of lateral thinking could yet save the day for the
proposal to house the National Gallery of Scottish Art and Design in the
Post Office in Glasgow's George Square.
As a public corporation, the Post Office is answerable to Parliament
for its actions, while having to meet the fiscal targets laid down by
Government. Its 5000 properties make it one of the largest
property-holders in the UK, and the disposal of all of them is subject
to Treasury control.
That does not mean they are obliged to obtain the highest-possible
price for the sale of each building. The credit they are required to put
on the balance sheet for the sale of a geographically and historically
significant building such as 1-5 George Square, built in 1857 and listed
as grade A, is measured not only in sterling but in the good name and
reputation of the Post Office.
Much of the strength of their good reputation in Scotland is directly
due to generous sponsorship of the arts, amounting to more than #500,000
in the past 10 years. As well as commissions and sponsorship in music,
literature, film, and dance, it has sponsored the book celebrating
Glasgow School of Art's 150th anniversary this year and the Scottish
Masters series of booklets on Scottish painters from the seventeenth
century to the present day.
With the bids by commercial developers for the George Square building
beating the Glasgow Development Agency/National Galleries price by
between #1m and #2m, it could be argued that the visual arts in Scotland
is looking for a particularly hefty piece of sponsorship for the new
National Gallery of Scottish Art and Design.
In that context, the new proposal which emerged yesterday that the
Post Office should retain an interest in part of the building for part
of the Royal Mail National Philatelic and Postal History collection,
valued at #500m, can be seen as enhancing its good name in Scotland.
It is also a very astute piece of commercial and political trading.
The sponsorship record alone of the Scottish Postal Board shows that,
free of other considerations, its members would favour the gallery
option. They have to sell that to their financial and political
scrutineers in London, who are likely to point out that the Post Office
is already doing more than its fair share for the well-being of
Scotland, since more than half the 2000 post offices run at a loss, but
continue as the lifeblood of small communities and the cost of
delivering a letter to the farthest-flung addresses is 20 times the cost
of a first-class stamp.
One of the many problems facing the Post Office top brass is the
inadequate and relatively inaccessible accommodation for their
impressive postal history collection. Its present home in a former
sorting office in King Edward Street in the City of London is too small
to display the whole postal history collection which includes the first
pillar boxes (designed by the author Anthony Trollope) and a number of
vehicles from stage coaches onwards.
The Royal Mail National Philatelic Collection, which includes all the
British stamps ever published, has obvious connections with both art and
Scotland, with special-edition stamps both on Scottish subjects and by
Scottish artists.
A permanent exhibition of something as mundane as stamps and postal
vehicles is likely to add another string to the bow of the gallery
lobby. The whole proposal depends on public funding, not only the #3m to
buy the building at the district valuer's pricing, but the #25m to #30m
required to convert it to a modern gallery.
With a limit of 30% on the share available through the European
Regional Development Fund, the application to the National Lottery
Heritage Fund will be for #20m or more. That particular honey jar is
already in a sticky mess for spending too much of its arts budget on a
largely London-based, elitist minority.
While an application which channels money north to Glasgow is likely
to be welcomed, a successful bid will have to do more than transfer some
of what is already on view elsewhere. The proposal has already received
promises of works from the Glasgow city collections including a series
of Mackintosh interiors which will form the basis of the design and
decorative arts part of the collection. Including philately can only
broaden the appeal.
The Post Office Board is the jury which has to decide between two
commercial bids and the gallery proposal. Glasgow City Council and its
planners will have to play judge and determine the sentence for George
Square.
The area is currently designated for office use and already the two
buildings next to the Post Office are being refurbished as modern office
space. Planning guidelines do not specifically exclude retail
development but major shopping developments would be steered towards the
Z-shaped shopping zone of Sauchiehall Street, Buchanan Street, and
Argyle Street.
As part of the campaign of persuasion by the council and Glasgow
Development Agency, Glasgow architects Page and Park were asked to
explore the creative possibility of the building. They came up with the
deliberately radical idea of removing part of the facade of George
Square and using a glass wall to blur the demarcation between the square
and the gallery.
''We kept the two towers on either side and the facades on the other
streets, because they are part of the streets round about. There may be
a view that it is important to keep the existing facade on George
Square, but at least it asks the question about the front of the
building and its relation to the square and indeed the whole future of
the square,'' said architect David Page.
That unresolved question must be answered before Glasgow parades
itself as city of architecture and design in 1999.
Glaswegians like to claim George Square as Scotland's greatest central
civic square. Edinburgh has a whole series of elegant and gardened
squares but the central position of George Square is unsurpassed.
Despite the City Chambers, a handsome cenotaph and a collection of
impressive statues, it is an unsatisfactory space. Suggestions for
improvements have gone little further than moving the statuary. The only
solution is to stop the crazy whirl of traffic which turns the square
itself into an inaccessible island.
The Post Office's move from its 138-year-old Glasgow flagship is a
unique opportunity for an old-fashioned, grand gesture of confidence to
the new century. If they show that magnanimity, it could be rewarded by
shortening the mouthful of the National Gallery of Scottish Art and
Design to something more manageable for everyday use: the Post Office
Gallery, maybe?

RECYCLING
* IN these days of virtual global recycling and, it's nice to see
something that's been improved in the process and not just mashed into
its constituent molecules.
The elegant bowl demonstrated by Katarina Barac started off its
existence as something a little less stylish. It probably went
completely unnoticed. In fact, it was the little port-hole in the front
of a washing machine, the thick pane of glass behind which everything
agitated, spun and came out brighter than an ad-man's smile.
Now it's a heavy duty designer artwork much in demand in Glasgow and
London. Katarina is just one of a generation of young designers working
the materials old and new. With partner William White in a start up
product design consultancy, One Foot Taller, they've won a Glasgow
Innovation Fund award for technology.
The award will enable them to design and build and test a prototype of
an innovative public seating system. Their design incorporates concrete
as a structural sandwiching support for sheet steel and Katarina says
the design is inspired by the tension of pinning a petal or even a
butterfly's wing to a rigid surface.
''We are designing something that has to be cheap to make and produce,
hard-wearing and vandal proof while keeping its elegance,'' Katarina
says. ''We'll be using manufacturing methods which will offer the
customer diverse shape, style and material qualities which can be unique
to a specific area. The Innovation Fund award will enable us to build a
prototype system which we can show to clients.
''The chairs are just part of our range which includes these glass
bowls which can be used as serving dishes or even just ornaments or
trophies. We reclaimed them from old washing machines and now have a
range of six sandblasted designs. It's a way of getting a
high-technology look from something that's been discarded. It's good to
get new from old, and to recycle something that's worth keeping.''

QUEBEC'S upcoming referendum has become an unlikely political football
in Scotland, where every politician from the Prime Minister to the
Nationalists is hoping to make hay from the result.
Tartan sibyls of all persuasions are claiming to have divined the
lesson from Quebec, whose citizens will go to the polls on October 30 to
choose whether or not to remain part of Canada. And those lessons,
however tenuous or contradictory, are shaping debate on Scotland's
future as plans are drawn up for our regional assembly.
No Scottish party can find much comfort in Quebec's current political
limbo; unionists and nationalists here both fear a ''wrong'' vote,
egging their faces by association, and those parties pushing a regional
assembly worry that Quebec's prolonged soul-searching will be used as
evidence that devolution doesn't calm restless natives.
John Major set the tone of the Conservatives' commentary earlier this
year when he told the Scots: ''If you want to live in a country with
high taxes, high unemployment, limited economic opportunities, and an
uncertain relationship with your major trading partners -- if you want
to live in a place like Quebec -- then vote for nationalism.''
Those remarks were only qualified after protests from the Canadian
High Commission in London and the then Quebec Agent-Generale, Harold
Mailhot, who pointed out that Quebec's taxes and unemployment were, in
fact, lower than Scotland's.
Canadian politics has, for the Conservatives, taken on a quality much
like a serious traffic accident -- you don't want to look, you just
can't help yourself. With every Scottish Tory seat a finely balanced
marginal, the memory of Kim Campbell's recent poll humiliation (the
Canadian Tories emerged from the last election with two parliamentary
seats) is enough to send shudders down true-blue spines. Should Quebec
opt for the status quo, Scotland's Tories will greet it as a rare
blessing from the west and a chance to decry separatism in all its
guises.
Opposite them, the Scottish National Party has been stocking up
Montreal Canadiens' jerseys and Joualonais dictionaries in an
anticipation of a vote to go. Not content with spectating from the
sidelines, they are sending an official observer to the referendum to
provide the separatists with adequate moral support.
According to Alan McCartney, the SNP's Foreign Affairs spokesman and
Member of the European Parliament, Quebec and Scotland couldn't be more
similar: ''We're both having to make decisions about our relationships
with larger, culturally dominant neighbours and determine the price of
our own independence. Personally, I would be very encouraged if Quebec
chose to separate. I think their victory could convincingly be presented
that to the Scottish people as a model of how to succeed within
Europe.''
Labour and Liberal Democrats, while hammering out plans for the new
assembly, have been wishing in their hearts that Quebec would simply
shut up and go away. The province's continued railings against the
inadequacy of its parliament -- itself far more powerful than anything
contemplated in Edinburgh -- are at best unhelpful and at worst
ammunition for doubting Tories and Nats.
Labour are taking to the task of reforming Scotland's constitutional
position with the enthusiasm of a man asked to mind a sodden diaper.
There is no good tactical reason for Labour to support a regional
assembly, except that their Scottish constituents demand one.
Politically, they may be creating a rod for their own backs.
Relations between Quebec's provincial and federal liberal parties,
occasionally in power at the same time, have often been frosty. The
Quebec experience of regional government offers no hope that devolution
can blunt a separatist movement, nor that even the most closely tied of
puppet parliaments will long suffer its master.
But Jack McConnell, Labour's Scottish chairman, remains optimistic
that Quebecs's referedum result will be good news for his party; I think
it may very well vindicate the idea that devolution of power can work.
The economic situations in Quebec and Scotland are very similar and I'm
sure voters will be pricing independence very carefully. The Quebec
voters may reach the same conclusion that I think most Scots have --
that the status quo makes economic sense.''
Quebec's new representative in Britain, Agent-Generale Richard Guay,
is unimpressed with any party's local spin on his province's political
environment: ''I think the political and economic differences between
Scotland and Quebec more than outweigh the similarities. It really is a
case of apples and oranges.
''But there is a tremendous cultural sympathy between the two as a
result of so much Scottish emigration -- the first separatist
parliamentary leader in Quebec's national assembly was a man named
Robert Burns -- so I can easily see why the Scottish parties are taking
such an interest.''
M Guay, the former Speaker of a Parti Quebecois (separatists)
provincial parliament, is keen to stress that most politically motivated
analysis of Quebec overplays its problems: ''I don't think anyone has
ever done a good job forecasting the economic consequences of
separation. In 1980, the last time Quebec confronted this issue
directly, voters were told that separation would cause higher
unemployment, higher interest rates, and a lower dollar. They voted to
stay in and got those three disasters anyway.
''It would be wrong to consider this a climactic moment in Quebecois
or Canadian politics with potentially apocalyptic consequences. It is
simply a natural development of a long-running debate and while it may
mark a change in the nature of our relationships with our major trading
partners, I am certain those relationships will continue and prosper.
''If there is any lesson of Quebec for Scotland, it would be to settle
your future as quickly as you can. We have been debating this at full
volume for the past 20 years and it has often paralysed us. Whatever
path Scotland takes, it would be wise not to agonise over the decision.
''I have a feeling Scottish interest in Quebec's politics will soon
wane, whatever the outcome. By mid-November I expect to be back to the
normal business of representing my province, and taking far fewer calls
from Britain's newsdesks.''

Paris
FRENCH President Jacques Chirac and Russia's Boris Yeltsin agreed
today that an extra stage should be added to the peace process for
former Yugoslavia, a preliminary round of talks in Moscow before the end
of October.
Chirac's spokeswoman, briefing journalists after a presidential summit
outside Paris, said the talks should group the heads of the three
ex-Yugoslav sides as well as members of the five-nation international
Contact Group of mediators.
Moscow, which wants a bigger say in the peace process, has repeatedly
called for an international conference on ex-Yugoslavia to be convened
in Moscow. But full talks grouping all interested parties are to begin
in Washington on October 31.
Chirac's tactful support for a round of talks in Moscow is a salve to
wounded Russian pride and would open the way for any final peace
agreement between rump Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Croatia to be signed in
Paris.
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said tonight, after meeting
Russia's Andrei Kozyrev, that the final stage of the peace process was
expected to be in Paris.
The spokeswoman said Chirac favoured letting Russia have a
peacekeeping deployment zone in Bosnia -- like France, Britain and the
United States -- ''as soon as there was a Russian contingent which
justified it''. Russia does not want its peacekeeping forces to be put
under Nato command.
Meanwhile, warring Muslims and Serbs met on their northwest Bosnia
frontlines today to establish a truce, signalling a possible end to
daily artillery duels that have endangered a nine-day-old US-brokered
ceasefire.
Commanders of the two sides met under UN auspices to discuss
implementing a ceasefire that was imposed last week as a prelude to
Serb-Croat-Muslim peace talks on the ex-Yugoslav territories in the
United States at the end of this month.
It was the first time that General Atif Dudakovic of the mainly-Muslim
government 5th Corps has been known to meet a Serb commander to discuss
the proposed halt in the fighting.
UN and European Union sources said the Dudakovic meeting took place
between Muslim-held Sanski Most and Serb-held Prijedor. A similar
meeting took place on the road between the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka
and Croat-held Mrkonjic Grad.
The Muslims captured Sanski Most 10 days ago, not long after the
Croats seized Mrkonjic Grad, in a co-ordinated offensive which captured
11 towns and 1500 square miles of territory from the Bosnian Serb Army.
''The aim was to establish the location of the confrontation line,'' a
Western military source said of today's meeting.
He did not know the outcome but said: ''There are indications the
Serbs launched an attack north of Krupa yesterday and last night.''
The 5th Corps' daily media statement issued at their headquarters in
Bihac said the Serbs rained small-arms and anti-aircraft fire all night
on government defence lines.
''On the Sanski Most front they used mortars, tanks and cannon,
targeting the defence lines and civilian settlements.
''Our soldiers responded adequately on several occasions, after which
the Chetnik (Serb) artillery apparently stopped.''
In Zagreb, a UN spokesman said the northwest was growing quieter, but
he reported some shelling northwest of Bosanska Krupa and around Sanski
Most.
''The BSA appears to have succeeded in pushing the 5th Corps back to
the area of Sanski Most during the past 24 hours to 48 hours,'' the
spokesman said, confirming earlier press reports.
UN spokesman Jim Landale in Sarajevo described the frontline parleys
as ''quite positive''. Both sides were keen to establish the ceasefire
and allow access to UN observers.
They agreed to meet every two days and to set up a hotline telephone
link, Landale said.
Both sides told local journalists they would honour the truce, which
has largely held everywhere else in Bosnia, and had defined the
confrontation lines in the area.
Local UN commander General Andrew Pringle told reporters the two sides
had also agreed to clear a minefield.
''The spirit between the two sides has been extremely harmonious, very
co-operative, and the will is definitely there to make a ceasefire stick
and do everything they can to make sure that it does,'' he said.
The head of the Serb team, General Zdravko Tolimir, told reporters
that the two sides also had agreed to exchange prisoners of war and the
bodies of victims.--Reuter.

THREE main candidates have emerged as the most likely successors to
Nato Secretary-General Willy Claes.
* RUUD LUBBERS: Former Dutch prime minister, power broker of Dutch
coalition governments and architect of the compromise that lead to the
Maastricht Treaty. Considered by many independent analysts as
front-runner. But he made several enemies during his 12 years in the
Dutch government.
* UFFE ELLEMANN-JENSEN: Former Danish foreign minister, considered
next strongest candidate. Ellemann-Jensen, 53, won plaudits for his
stewardship of Danish foreign policy from 1982--1993, but may find his
flamboyant style counts against him.
* HANS VAN DEN BROEK: EU external affairs commissioner and former
Dutch foreign minister could win out as compromise choice. He has a
reputation as a business-like, if slightly dull, politician.
* THORVALD STOLTENBERG: A Norwegian, the UN special envoy to former
Yugoslavia is likely to be ruled out. Alliance sources say he would be
opposed by Washington because of the rabid anti-UN sentiment in
Congress.

Brussels
WILLY Claes's resignation as Nato secretary-general comes at a
critical time for the alliance as it finalises the biggest operational
challenge in its history -- the policing of a Bosnian peace accord.
But optimistic Nato officials said Claes's departure would allow them
finally to turn the page on months of uncertainty and concentrate on the
future.
''It's a clean break. It may not have been pleasant and, of course, it
could have been at a better time, but it is what was needed,'' said one
alliance official.
The alliance's 16-member governments were expected to move swiftly to
fill the vacancy created by Claes's resignation in a tawdry Belgian
corruption and bribery scandal.
Diplomats said capitals had been quietly sounding out candidates for
weeks, aware of the damage a prolonged vacuum could have on delicate
negotiations with Russia both on its involvement in the Bosnia force and
relations in general.
Nato sources described Claes's one-year tenure of the job as a
''tragic farce'' as the alliance lurched uneasily from one crisis to
another before finally emerging last month with glory from its air blitz
against recalcitrant Bosnian Serbs.
Throughout, a bribery-for-contracts scandal dating back to when Claes
was Belgium's economics minister in 1988 simmered away, threatening to
blow up in the alliance's face.
''It kept threatening to derail us, you have to be able to concentrate
100% on this job,'' said one source.
Member states had hoped Claes, chosen largely because no-one else was
available, would help to define a new role for Nato in the post-Cold War
era. He led it into what was essentially a conflict situation and won
several plaudits.
But, with a successful ground operation in former Yugoslavia now
deemed essential for Nato's long-term credibility, member states will be
looking for a ''clean and safe'' pair of hands.
Claes's successor will also have to deal with Russia's anger over
plans to expand the alliance into formerly communist Central and Eastern
Europe. Talks on enlargement are expected to begin after January 1997.
As well as trying to build a new relationship with an increasingly
erratic Russian leadership, considerable diplomatic skill will be needed
to assuage the feeling of those countries not invited to join in the
first batch of new members.
Nato's assistant secretary general for political affairs, Gebhard von
Moltke, said he regretted Claes's resignation but it would not hinder
the alliance's moves toward enlargement.
''It is a loss for the alliance,'' von Moltke said during an official
visit to Prague. ''It won't slow down work, neither in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, nor in the enlarging of Nato.''
Claes is the sixth victim of the scandal involving French and Italian
defence firms.
The affair, inadequately dubbed the Agusta case after only one of the
firms said to have paid off politicial parties to win their backing for
major orders in 1988--89, has dogged Belgian politics for the last 22
months.
It has claimed the scalps of four government ministers. An air force
general, named in connection with the scandal, killed himself in a
Brussels hotel room.
Two left-wing parties, part of the coalition of the day, allegedly
received almost five million dollars for support for a $400m order for
Agusta helicopters and a $200m deal with France's Dassault to modernise
fighter jets.
At the time, the late 1980s, socialist Claes was economics minister in
the centre-left cabinet.

Rome
CONSERVATIVE media magnate Silvio Berlusconi pressed forward today
with his efforts to topple Italy's government as his allies and the
hard-left urged Prime Minister Lamberto Dini to resign before he was
pushed out.
Berlusconi's Forza Italia party said the former prime minister would
present a no-confidence motion in the government, made up of unelected
technocrats, to parliament by Monday.
The motion would declare firm opposition to the 1996 budget and argue
that a centre-left vote of no-confidence in Justice Minister Filippo
Mancuso, passed by the Senate (upper house) yesterday, turned the
administration into a political animal.
It was unclear when the motion would be debated in the 630-seat
Chamber of Deputies. It would need an absolute majority to pass.
Its prospects were boosted when the Marxist party Communist
Refoundation, with 24 deputies, said Dini should quit. ''The Dini
government now stains the democratic life of the country and should
therefore go,'' the party said in a statement.
Dini, a former central banker who was in Berlusconi's cabinet last
year, has relied on centre-left support in Italy's hung parliament since
taking over in January after the billionaire businessman resigned.
Mancuso bitterly attacked him in the storm over the minister's
disciplinary moves against anti-graft magistrates.
The leaders of two small centrist parties in Berlusconi's Freedom
Alliance bloc, Rocco Buttiglione and Pier Ferdinando Casini, both urged
Dini to offer his resignation.
Buttiglione said this would lead to a parliamentary debate on Italy's
future, allowing a more orderly path to an early election, while a
no-confidence vote risked precipitating a poisonous snap poll, possibly
by Christmas.--Reuter.

Utrecht
THE Roman Catholic Church in the Netherlands admitted today it was
partly to blame for the mass murder of Jews in the Second World War.
''A tradition of theological and church anti-Semitism contributed to
the climate which allowed the Shoah (Holocaust) to take place,'' the
Dutch Roman Catholic Bishops' Conference said in a statement.
An estimated 100,000 Jews were deported from German-occupied Holland
to Nazi death camps.
The Dutch bishops said they now joined their Polish and German
counterparts in admitting that the church carried part of the
responsibility for the persecution of Jews in the past.
''A so-called catechism of revulsion taught that after the death of
Christ, Jews were held to have been rejected as a people,'' the bishops
said.--Reuter.

IT is estimated there are more than two million home workers in
Britain and that number is expected to quadruple during the next 10
years. Most are self-employed or part of a family business.
There are many advantages to working from home, including flexible
hours and no commuting. But there are also extra financial matters you
must deal with. For example, you will probably have to take out
additional insurance. However, you may be able to reduce your bills by
offsetting some expenses against your income, and you could even get
extra tax relief on your mortgage.
Many people assume that if they only have a modest amount of business
equipment at home, such as a personal computer and a fax machine, these
are automatically covered by their ordinary contents policies. But this
is not so.
Many major insurers are prepared to provide increased cover for home
business equipment if requested, but the amount is limited. Direct Line
and Norwich Union, for instance, say policy holders can add up to #5000
to their household contents policies for business equipment providing
the items are specified.
However, an ordinary household policy cannot be extended to cover
other types of business risk, such as public or employer's liability,
business interruption insurance or loss of business money. In the past
this has meant taking out expensive commerical insurance.
Fortunately the special needs of people working from home are
beginning to be recognised. Earlier this month Cheshire-based
Independent Insurance launched a new policy which provides all the usual
home cover for buildings and contents, plus a range of business cover.
This includes stock and business records as well as furniture and
equipment. An all-risks extension is available for business equipment
outside the home. Cash up to #500 and cheques up to #250,000 are insured
too.
Business interruption cover is also provided so you are protected
against loss of earnings and other expenses should you be unable to work
because of something like a fire or flooding. In addition, you get up to
#2.5m to cover your legal liability to other people in case of
accidental injury or damaged property arising from goods sold or
supplied by you. It also covers your liabilities to employees and the
public.
Independent Insurance, which sells its policies through brokers, has
no fixed premium scales but claims that, by assessing each case
individually, it can save home workers up to 20% on their overall
premiums.
If you do office-type work from home, an alternative policy is offered
nationwide by London-based broker Tolson Messenger. This covers office
contents, business interruption, money, and public and employer's
liability. It can be extended to stock in trade, goods in transit,
personal accident, product liability and commercial legal expenses.
Premiums start at #120.
One of the advantages of working from home is that some expenses, such
as insurance premiums, can be offset against tax. Other outlays, such as
the cost of heating part of your home used for business and phone calls,
are also allowable.
Until this year, though, no part of your mortgage interest was
definable as a business expense if you had a single loan on your
property, even if you were using parts of it exclusively for work. This
was only possible if you had separate loans to acquire the two parts.
A new concession by the Inland Revenue now allows that where there is
a single loan, part of the interest may be treated as a business
expense. So if you are using one room out of five for work, a fifth of
the interest will be allowed as a business deduction. This also means
you will be able to claim tax relief at your usual rate of income tax --
25% or 40% -- whereas under MIRAS tax relief has been reduced to only
15%.

Colombo
SRI Lankan troops combed the capital for Tamil Tiger guerrillas today
after a violence-racked day in which two oil depots were bombed and 25
people were killed.
The rebels were feared ready to stage more suicide attacks in a bid to
stall an army push in the rebel-held north, security forces said.
''We've cordoned off certain areas of the city and have launched
house-to-house searches for the terrorists who remain at large,'' a
senior military officer told Reuters. ''There might be more hit squads
hiding in the city.''
At least 25 people, including five attackers, died when the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, including Black Tiger suicide
bombers, blew up two of Sri Lanka's three oil depots and shot at
security forces early today, they said.
At least 32 people, including a BBC correspondent, were wounded.
Police reported rebels being involved in gunfights with troops at two
places near the oil depots. Troops were also combing a jungle area near
one depot from which a police patrol came under fire.
A huge pall of smoke from the blazing oil depots hung over Colombo
streets deserted after the government extended a curfew until dawn
tomorrow to prevent a backlash against minority Tamils and looting of
homes abandoned by residents fleeing the fire.
A team of Indian fire-fighting experts was expected in Colombo soon
along with special firefighting equipment to douse the blazes,
government officials said.
An official said troops fired into the air to prevent Sinhalese mobs
from attacking Tamils near the oil depots.
But police said any possible backlash against Tamils had been nipped
in the bud.
The raid by a 20-strong Tamil rebel group dressed in army fatigues
came around the same time President Chandrika Kumaratunga, herself on
the guerrillas' hit list, left for New York to address the United
Nations.
The attack on the Kolonnawa and Orugosdawatte oil depots, in which
some 40,000 tonnes of diesel and 15,000 tonnes of kerosine went up in
flames, forced Sri Lanka to ban petrol sales temporarily and limit
supplies of aviation fuel to airlines.
Military sources told Reuters that the aviation fuel shortage could
affect air support for a major push by 10,000 soldiers against rebels in
their Jaffna peninsula stronghold.--Reuter.

Las Vegas
A 29-YEAR-OLD history student has made gambling history with a record
slot machine win of nearly $11m.
The student, who asked to remain anonymous, won $10,918,881 with a
single pull of the handle on a Megabucks dollar progressive machine at
the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on Wednesday, IGT, the
company that created the Megabucks system, announced today.
The previous record, according to John Russell, chief executive
officer for IGT, was $9.3m, set in 1992.
The lucky winner, who will receive his money in annual instalments,
said at first he was not aware he had hit the jackpot.
''I had been playing for five minutes and I was more concerned with
unwrapping my role of dollar tokens when someone pointed out to me that
I had hit the jackpot. The fact that I had won simply didn't register,''
said the Las Vegas resident.
The Megabucks system links 726 slot machines in 137 Nevada casinos to
a single jackpot that builds from a base amount of $5m. Russell said
that to date, Megabucks has produced 38 millionaires.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Banks and building societies save by uniting but customers may suffer. Are you being served by merger mania?</HEADLINE>

MERGER mania is back among our biggest financial insitutions, but will
all this getting together really bring benefits for customers? Certainly
those with the National &amp; Provincial building society should see initial
rewards for being swallowed up by the Abbey National.
More than half a million borrowers and savers stand to receive shares
worth #500. To be eligible you need to have had at least #100 in a
qualifying savings account (or outstanding on a mortgage) on April 28
this year and still have it there come December.
In addition, your savings (or mortgage) account must still be open
when the deal is formally completed, probably late next summer.
Savers who have a share account continuously between December 31,
1993, and December 31, 1995, will get #750 in cash or Abbey National
shares plus a bonus worth at least 5% of the account balance up to
#50,000. This extra payment is based on the amount in your account on
April 28 this year, or on the day the takeover goes ahead if that
balance is lower.
In the other big takeover to hit the headlines recently the initial
benefits for customers are rather less obvious.
There is no windfall unless you also happen to be a TSB or Lloyds Bank
shareholder. TSB shareholders are to receive a special 68.3p dividend
for each share they hold and one new share in the merged company. Lloyds
shareholders will receive just over 2.7 new Lloyds/TSB shares for every
one they now hold.
Lloyds and TSB say they hope to achieve #350m in cost savings if their
proposed end-of-year marriage goes ahead. That is enough to fund a 1%
reduction in their borrowers' mortgages, for instance, but how much of
those savings will eventually filter down to customers remains to be
seen.
Ironically, one noticeable effect of the get-together could be longer
queues at cash dispensers in Scotland.
Lloyds' seven million customers can already use cash machines at Royal
Bank of Scotland branches, but after the merger a further
seven-and-a-half million TSB customers could become eligible to use the
900 or so Royal Bank machines. With the average bank customer making 26
withdrawals a year from a cash machine that is likely to mean longer
waits to get at your money.
In turn, Lloyds customers should for the first time have
free-of-charge use of the 1900 or so TSB Speedbank machines -- and,
potentially, all the other building societies and banks in the Link
network.
Many Lloyds bank shareholders may well have a longer journey to the
annual general meeting, however. The new merged bank will have its
registered office in Scotland -- the TSB is already registered here and
was planning to hold its next AGM in Edinburgh.
Lloyds shareholders used to attending meetings in London will have to
travel to this side of the Border if they want to sit in on AGMs in
future.
Meanwhile, shareholders in both camps should certainly sit tight.
Further information about the merger and voting forms is expected to be
sent out early next month. Moreover, the TSB is planning to set up a
telephone helpline for shareholders -- there are an estimated 120,000 in
Scotland.
Mega-mergers may please the stockmarket -- prices of both TSB and
Lloyds shares rose when the marriage was announced -- but it is vital
that customers see real improvements in services if these giant
organisations are to prosper.
Many customers still insist they want access to a convenient branch
network, despite the growing success of telephone banking, but mergers
such as that of Lloyds and TSB are bound to lead to branch closures if
large cost savings are to make sense.
Since 1990 the biggest societies and banks have closed one in 10 of
their branches. The major worry is that this increasing remoteness from
the customer will mean mistakes and confusion over dealing with
complaints get worse rather than better.
In a recent report by consumer magazine Which? a quarter of those
taking part found a mistake last year in their current account. ''This
level of mistakes is unacceptable,'' the magazine says.
There are bright spots within the gloom. The Royal Bank of Scotland,
Alliance &amp; Leicester and the telephone-based banking service First
Direct came out best for overall customer satisfaction.
Experts believe that advances in computer technology will be the key
to the success of financial institutions.
The TSB is already among the leaders with its computer systems.
Customers depositing cash, for instance, find the money is immediately
credited to their account and is accessible straight away thanks to the
TSB's ''on-line, real-time'' system.
Customers of other banks are usually surprised to find that cash paid
in one day cannot be withdrawn until the next. That is because banks
typically credit cash to accounts only at the end of the working day.
The TSB system is particularly helpful for small businesses which
handle a lot of cash, but the bank's computer technology has other
advantages too.
TSB customers can pay their Trustcard credit card bill on the day
settlement is due -- rather than having to write a cheque a least a week
in advance so that it has time to clear, a service which may well be
offered to Lloyds customers too in due course.

PROSHARE, the organisation which campaigns for wider share ownership
and better deals for shareholders, has come up with some good ideas in
its time. More often than not it manages to get them put into practice
too. It has a nice idea right now, although getting this one adopted
looks particularly difficult.
It would like individual investors to be allowed to be their own
personal equity plan managers.
At the moment even if the investor makes all the decisions for his or
her PEP, choosing which shares should be bought and which sold, there
still has to be a ''plan manager''. The manager will hold the shares, or
units if the PEP is among the majority which are invested in unit
trusts, putting them into a nominee account.
But, and here is where the ProShare idea is likely to run into
problems, the manager is also accountable to the Inland Revenue, which
from time to time checks that PEPs are being run in accordance with the
rules. And the Revenue clearly finds it easier to do this by going to a
restricted number of plan managers.
Naturally enough the managers make a charge for their work. When PEPs
started, a combination of high fees and a low limit on the amount which
could be invested in any one tax year threatened to kill off the whole
idea. That is now only a memory. PEPs are now a multi-million pound
business. The annual investment allowance is #6000 for a general PEP and
#3000 for the single company version, and hot competition for investors'
cash has bitten deep into the management charges.
Some investors may prefer the idea of having a manager to hold -- and
in many cases select -- the shares, collect the dividends, claim the tax
refunds and so on, and would be prepared to pay a fee for the service.
But there is a powerful case for letting the investor do it for him or
herself and save the money.
After all, plenty of people buy and sell shares outside PEPs;
dividends will come in automatically, and the only extra piece of work
the investor would have to do would be reclaiming the tax deducted from
the dividend cheque.
ProShare's chief executive Gill Nott is ''lobbying hard'' to persuade
the Chancellor to remove the restriction. ''We are saying there should
be tax neutrality, and if people want to manage their own money they
should be allowed to do so, and not have to pay fees to other people in
order to get the tax break,'' she says.
The impending changeover in the income tax system to self-assessment
adds weight to her argument that people should be allowed to notify
their own PEP holdings.
A major point of concern is that the existing system encourages more
and more money and thus an increasing number of shares to go into
managed funds -- PEPs, pension funds and so on -- and direct investment
in shares will continue to fall.
ProShare has consistently argued for people to get more involved with
direct investment as well as collective vehicles.
One of the ways it has successfully been encouraging individual share
ownership is through investment clubs. ''They are probably one of the
best ways in which potential investors can learn,'' says Mrs Nott.
''People pool their funds and agree what shares they should buy. It is
rather like a do-it-yourself unit trust and spreads the risk over a
number of shares. It is a very social activity and the club members have
a great deal of fun selecting and monitoring their shares.''
She estimates there are between 750 and 1000 investment clubs in
Britain, although in the US where the idea began there are believed to
be around 50,000. ProShare together with Barclays Stockbrockers, which
offers special services to investment clubs, is now sponsoring a book on
the subject. Investment Clubs -- The Low Risk Way to Stockmarket Profits
is written by Tony Drury, former director of private investor services
at ProShare, and is priced at #6.99. It gives advice on how to start or
join an investment club.
A lot are based on the work environment or a social activity, and in
many cases the monthly meetings to discuss investment ideas are held in
pubs. Mr Drury says a typical club will have between three and a maximum
of 20 members, each putting in a regular monthly sum. Contributions
usually start at #25 a month.
ProShare itself publishes a detailed manual covering the legal,
accounting and tax problems and how to cope with unit valuation. This
costs #25. Mrs Nott says: ''It gives step-by-step guidance for setting
up and running a club. In the US the investment club movement is huge.
We would like it to be huge here.''
Tony Vine-Lott, managing director of Barclays Stockbrokers, says that
although six million of the UK's 11 million shareholders bought their
first shares in the privatisation programmes, it is estimated only about
200,000 have so far gone on to buy and sell other shares.
Membership of ProShare, which includes a year's supply -- 10 issues --
of its Investor magazine and various special offers, normally costs
#29.95 but Herald readers pay a reduced price of #26. You can contact
ProShare at 13-14 Basinghall Street, London EC2V 5BQ.

* HOLLYWOOD director (and one time husband of Upstairs, Downstairs
actress Lesley Ann Down) William Friedkin, has never been a subtle
film-maker. You'll recall he made his name with The French Connection
which remains a classic of the clever but slam-bam crime thriller genre.
His follow-up movie, The Exorcist, was rather more spectacular at
getting across his message.
Almost 25 years later Friedkin has mellowed. Audiences don't even know
they are being given clues in his sexescapade chiller, Jade. He admitted
this week that he has inserted ''subliminal'' messages into the film
which features NYPD Blue deserter David Caruso and Linda Fiorentino who
was remarkable in The Last Seduction.
Friedkin happily explains that by inserting images that flash for only
a split-second during the movie's normal sequencing he hopes to induce a
''jarring'' effect on his audience.
The film, something of a Basic Instinct clone, opened in America this
week. Audiences were not told they were being given ''secret'' clues.
Experts in subliminal research say that Paramount Studios which is
distributing Jade in the States could be in trouble.
Friedkin's method of helping audiences guess the killer -- and the
other bad types -- turned out to be too subtle for the critics. The
''messages'' didn't lead to many reasonable reviews.
* HALLOWEEN must be looming. Johnny Depp has bought a house once owned
by Bela Lugosi. The price of the home -- $9.9m -- is not his only
connection with the legendary movie Dracula. Depp played the title role
of ''Ed Wood'' in the film which won Martin Landau an Oscar last year --
for playing Bela Lugosi.
* EDDIE Fisher who left Debbie Reynolds for Elizabeth Taylor, who left
him for Richard Burton, is going back to recording. With his daughter
Tricia Leigh Stevens -- from his post-Taylor marriage to Connie Stevens
-- they are taking the Nat King/Natalie Cole route doing duets together.
Their album of pop standards will include Oh! My Papa.
* LANA Turner's bijoux, baguettes, baubles and beads go for auction on
November 2 at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills. Like Liberace, she
was an eclectic collector of real jewellery and fabulous fakes. For La
Lana fans things get even better at Christie's in New York a month later
when her scripts, costumes and autographs will be sold.
* TALKING of beauty-spotted Miss Crawford. John Travolta says her
erstwhile paramour Richard Gere found fame courtesy of him. Travolta,
who is a sensation in the up-coming Get Shorty based on Elmore Leonard's
novel, says he turned down the lead in An Officer and a Gentleman
explaining: ''I was studying for my pilot's licence at the time and I
didn't want to play one when I was on the verge of being one.'' Richard
Gere became a star but not one as mighty as the present Travolta
incarnation. Times change.

BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with non-European Union countries narrowed
to #696m in September from August's #980m on the back of soaring
exports, up 10% to a record #5682m against a 3[1/2]% increase in imports
to #6378m, also a record high.
Market projections had centred on a deficit of approaching #900m but
despite the better than expected figures, there is considerable caution
about whether exports will continue to grow in the coming months.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday pointed out that changes in
the balances on oil and erratics such as ships, aircraft, precious
stones, and silver account for almost half the reduction in the deficit.
Even so, after stripping these out, the gap still narrowed from #744m to
#582m, the lowest level since April.
It made little impression in financial markets, including currency
markets where both the pound and dollar slid against a once again
dominant German mark boosted by political worries about France and Italy
whose currencies were also in sharp decline.
Despite the the more buoyant trading outcome for the month, the latest
estimate of trend suggests a widening of the deficit. On a quarterly
basis, at #2548m the third quarter was up from #2056m in the second
quarter and is the highest since the first quarter of 1993.
After excluding oil and erratics, the volume of exports was up 5[1/2]%
in September compared with August while imports rose 1%. On this basis,
the latest estimates of trends shows exports and imports both rising. In
the third quarter, the volume of exports rose 4[1/2]% while imports were
6% ahead, both at record quarterly levels.
Much of the September improvement was accounted for by North America,
where the deficit narrowed from #413m to #174m with exports rising from
#1581m to #1884m, comfortably outpacing the increase in imports. This
clearly was a welcome development, indicating that the region was
picking up.
Commenting on the trade gap, the Treasury said: ''Exports in September
at record levels contributed to the smallest trade deficit for five
months.''
President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang said the figures showed
British companies continued to produce products of the quality and price
that the rest of the world wanted to buy.
''The manufacturing sector is vital to our export effort. Total
manufactured goods represent 80% of our exports and they continue to
show consistent growth.''
The figures were generally welcomed as encouraging by analysts though
some of them emphasised that the underlying position remained a litle
worrying, with the improvement not sufficient to reverse the strongly
deteriorating trend in the deficit that had been in place this year.

Joe Donnelly has a whiff of things to come as he looks at the plans to
clean up on all those awful odours
ENVIRONMENTALISTS -- and the world's population at large -- are more
and more concerned about the ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere
because of the possible harmful effects of radiation and the change in
global climate.
The lack of ozone could also be making the world a smellier place, and
the hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic is partially as a result
of chemicals in . . . deodorants. Because ozone gas is a natural
bactericide and has the property of chemically neutralising odours,
Ozone Industries of Hampshire has come up with a sweet-air solution to
air contamination which they say quietly and cheaply tackles the problem
of bad smells in an environmentally friendly way.
Off-scents like cigarette smoke, sewage and cold remains of carry-out
curries result from airborne chemicals and bacteria. Ozonisers,
according the firm, release carefully controlled amounts of pure natural
ozone which neutralises the smell and then reverts to natural oxygen,
leaving no harmful remains.
Ozonisers which produce the gas -- the chemical itself reverts to
oxygen in 20 minutes, so it must be produced on site -- are designed to
mask for food preparation, pets and livestock, chemical fumes, and of
course gym changing rooms. According to the company, they can reduce
spores and pollen levels, kill surface bacteria on food and neutralise
chemical pollution from exhaust fumes.
* THE active ingredient from a herb long used in traditional Chinese
medicine to curb alcohol abuse, has been found to work, scientifically.
Diadzin, an ancient oriental remedy suppresses the desire for alcohol.
So far it only cuts down the desire in Syrian golden hamsters, but
even so, that's encouraging because it does so by a method said to be
less toxic than other anti-alcohol treatments.
The herb has been used for centuries in China with no adverse side
effects reported. Harvard researchers found that Daidzin suppresses
alcohol consumption in hamsters without affecting the overall
detoxification of acetaldehyde, the main metabolic product from ethanol.
* MEANWHILE, Oregon researchers have found that ginseng, another
ancient Chinese folk medicine works in the same way as opium and heroin.
A trace ingredient of ginseng reputed to relieve a variety of ailments
associated with stress, works to inhibit neuro-transmitters using the
same cellular effect as a maximal dose of opioids.
Opioids ability to block this process is one key element in their
capacity to cause spinal analgesia. Crude extracts of ginseng cause
analgesic and antinarcotic effects on animals. The research could lead
the way to a new set of anaesthetics and painkillers which are non toxic
and non addictive.
* A NEW way to make night landings safer for helicopter pilots has
been tested on a Royal navy ship and will soon be in operation on
platforms and rigs in the north sea. It uses luminous panels in place of
conventional lights which cause what is described as the ''black hole''
effect and could be responsible for vertical drop crashes. The effect
happens when the individual points of light do not seem to get bigger as
they come closer, which makes it impossible to judge the height.
Now Metalite Aviation Lighting have solved that problem by panels
coated with an agent which glows when a current goes through it. Laid
out in a pattern, the panels, more than a yard long, provide a
directional signal which makes it easier to gauge distances. The panels
are very cheap to make and use very small amounts of power. One
suggestion from the Birmingham company is that they be installed on top
of high-rise buildings to guide in rescue helicopters in the event of
fire.
* COMPUTER software always seems to be at the sharp end of technology,
but it's not all it's cracked up to be. When judged by the reliability
standards of any other consumer goods, programming packages are simply
abominable, according to the recently published The Which? Guide to
Computers.
The Which? scanning microscope has looked at the whole spectrum of
computing and is not impressed. Users can expect bugs in many common
software packages, advertised features often simply don't work and
software can even cause systems to crash.
Come to think of it, there can be few of us computer users who haven't
had a bad program booted up the machine.
Author Richard Wentk says: ''If washing machines, cars and video
recorders went on the market with the same reliability problems, the
public outcry would be deafening.'' Yet he says that so far the software
industry has managed to survive without serious consumer resistance to
its poor record of reliability. When people do take action, according to
the book, the cases are often settled out of court with great secrecy.
Apart from software, and bugs, what bugs many people, and Wentk in
particular, is the attitude of retailers. The guide asserts that high
street electronics stores charge the highest prices, offer the lowest
level of support and that more than half of all computer systems bought
won't suit the buyer. Some people spend two or three times more than
they need to on systems that still might not do the job they were bought
for.
At the speed of development of computers -- and the electronic world
is evolving faster than ever -- it's an outrage that sloppy programming
and development alongside poor service and support is slowing everything
up.
The Which? Guide to Computers -- no jargon or tech-speak -- covers the
whole gamut from software piracy to RSI, printers, modems and the
Internet and much more besides. Possibly set to become the electronic
bible. #10.99 from bookshops.

The convention will allow up to 12 of the top M. Eng students an

Phil Penfold talks to actor Nick Berry on his latest role as a
paparrazi photographer.
FROM the gentle rolling North Yorkshire moors, to the dog-eat-dog
world of London photographic journalism. It's a huge character leap for
actor Nick Berry, and he knows it.
Berry, now 32, is gearing up to shoot a new series (the fourth) of
Heartbeat next January, but in the meantime, Yorkshire Television, as
part of their ''golden handcuffs'' deal with the star, have lined up a
#1.5m pilot for him. A show which both Berry and YTV hope will turn into
a series.
And if Berry initially knew little about the ways of being a copper on
the beat in the northern wilds of Yorkshire, the new subject is at least
something with which he is familiar.
He plays photographer Rick Caulker, a member of the happy snapping
team whose job it is to catch celebrities unawares. And to sell the
pictures of that certain special moment to the tabloids and the
personality-driven magazines.
''In real life, they've always been pretty good to me,'' admits Berry,
when we meet up in the central West End club beloved by the celebs who
court the limelight, Stringfellows.
''It's very odd at first, because when I had a bit of fame after
EastEnders, they were always taking my picture and the first reflex to a
flashlight photo is to hold your hand up in front of your face. Which
makes you look a bit of a prat, and doesn't give them too much of a
picture! So I've always reckoned if you're open and honest with other
people, they'll be open and honest with you, and I try, within reason,
to give the real paparazzi what they want.''
The scheduling of Paparazzo (STV) next Wednesday evening might even
see Berry as PC Nick Rowan from Heartbeat one night, and as Rick the
next, if the series goes ahead and the two projects clash. ''I obviously
hope that won't happen, because I simply don't want people to get
confused,'' he says.
Looking around Stringfellows at lunchtime, Berry quips: ''I've never
been here in the daytime,'' and then admits that the research for
Paparazzo ''was pretty complicated because I went out with several of
the real-life guys to see how they actually operate. They were very
generous with their time when they realised that we weren't messing
about.
''And it was extremely odd to be on the other side of the fence for a
change. I didn't dare go out to a West End premiere, so we did something
a bit more low-key. The premiere of The Lion King in Nottingham! But
even so, it was an eye-opener. The good picture depends on a lot of
skill -- but an awful lot of good luck. Being in the right place at the
right time. So I can warm to these guys, because acting is almost
exactly the same thing.''
One of the strongest characters in the new show is a footballer who,
reaching 30, is worried that his career is on the skids, and who is
turning to drink. Tony Kambona is played by Gary Beadle, and, says
Berry, ''it's a very impressive and true-to-life performance.
''When you're an actor, you can go on looking for work until the day
you drop. Footballers can't. Age and injury creep up on them. And their
earning capacity can be over pretty quickly.''
It's a fact that, he confesses, sends a bit of a chill through his
bones, since in his teens, although he was a keen stage performer, ''I
actually wanted to be a football player, and I even had a trial for
Leyton Orient.
''God knows if I'd ever made anything of it, or if my skills, such as
they were, would have been up to it, but fate intervened. While I was
playing rugby, of all things, I slipped and fell and broke my leg. The
idea of football stardom was over. And in a way, I think it may have
been fate speaking to me. Because things have turned out pretty well
since then.''
Berry vows that he won't be telling his new son, Louis, now three
months, what to do with his career in later years. ''How could I? He
must go out and do what he wants to do, as long as he does it to the
very best of his ability.
''He's not keeping us awake at night at all, and seems to sleep for
most of the time, thank God. Rachel and I are both delighted at that.
Filming Paparazzo last autumn was a holiday for me, because I was able
to get home so frequently -- rather different from the film sets around
Goathland which, though beautiful, means that you're there for months on
end, come rain or come shine.
''Fatherhood? Louis puts life into perspective. Anyone with a child
will tell you that. It just opens the windows on life and lets the light
in.''
Coincidentally, Berry's character Rick ''also loves West Ham and
wanted to be a footballer too. In a sense I'm a damn sight better off
than him because when I play for the odd charity team, I actually get to
appear at Wembley, which still gives me a thrill. And, let's face it,
it's a darn sight more than most West Ham players have had the
opportunity of doing in real life.
''I rather like Rick -- he's completely different to Nick Rowan, and,
of course, it's set in contemporary times rather than a couple of
decades back. Mind you, there's also a strong musical theme to the
pilot, because part of it is set in a jazz club where Geno Washington
and the Ram Jam Band are doing a set!
''I would, however, like him to be a little more ruthless, have a bit
more edge. That will come.''
Before more Heartbeat, Berry is filming yet another YTV project, a
thriller based on Richard La Plante's novel Respect, ''in which I'll
play a very hard-nosed and cynical boxer who had done time and who is
learning to live again by doing work in the community. I've been to a
fitness trainer for the last few weeks to get into tone and shape, and
it's bloody hard work.
''I'm not tired of playing Mr Nice Guy, but maybe it's time that I
looked at parts that, well, had a more brutal sense to them.''
So would he ever like to be a Paparazzo in real life? ''No way. Rick
kind of enjoys it despite himself, and it pays the rent. Bit like acting
in fact. But I don't think I've got the cynicism.''
But the show at least helped him out in one respect. ''I've learned a
lot more about how to use a camera. I'm rather enjoying it -- although
most of the pictures are of Louis, with or without his mum.
''Self-portraits? Nah. As I learn more about this business, I get more
and more private. And that's the way I like it, even when I'm doing the
pictures myself!''

THE manager of Martin Currie's #301m Securities Trust of Scotland
believes continued bid activity could keep the UK market at its current
dizzy height, even though he believes equity valuations are stretched in
terms of economic fundamentals.
Although naturally cautious about the level to which the takeover
frenzy has pushed the London stock market, Tim Hall said: ''I think it
would be wrong to underestimate the cash support for the stock market in
terms of money raised from bids.
''Bids that have taken place over the last 12 months have fuelled the
appetite for equities and corporate activity will continue.''
However, he believed UK equity values were ''stretched'' in the
context of their historical benchmark, the gilt market.
The strength of UK equities helped Securities Trust's net asset value
to rise 11.5% to 94.0p during the six months to end-September.
Ironically, this same strength led to the fund underperforming its
benchmark All-Share Index, which rose 14.9%.
Held for the sake of income, Securities Trust's fixed-interest
holdings, comprising debentures, Preference shares and Italian, South
African and Spanish bonds, account for 8% of the portfolio.
These fixed interest investments trailed equities in terms of capital
performance.
Securities Trust, which is 68%-invested in UK equities, benefited from
a strong performance by its holdings in North America, which account for
8% of the fund, and Continental Europe, which account for 5%.
The plethora of bid activity in the utilities sector boosted
Securities Trust's holding in London Electricity.
Dundee-based food distribution company Watson &amp; Philip and
Edinburgh-based Forth Ports also did well for Securities Trust.
The Edinburgh-based trust is trying to build a portfolio of
medium-sized UK companies where yield allows. Although lower-yielding,
medium-sized stocks can offer more attractive capital growth.
Although Mr Hall is keen to take advantage of the opportunities he
sees in Japan and other Far Eastern markets, yield considerations again
limit the extent to which he can do this. Of Securities Trust's current
8% exposure to Asia, Japan accounts for only 1%.
The outlook is also considered bright for smaller markets, which
account for 3% of the fund.
Securities Trust's interim dividend is unchanged at 1.08p. In April,
the fund brought the total dividend for the year to end-March to 3.37p,
its first increase in payout for three years.
Interim earnings per share rose from 1.57p to 1.63p this year.

RADIO 4's Books and Company is perfect late-Sunday morning listening.
It's relaxed in its cleverness, properly arty because it lacks
pomposity, and it's even funny. You have to know about the arts before
you can properly send it up its world, otherwise you get Benny Hill
finding ballet a poof-filled world of taffeta -- and if you agree with
that don't bother reading on.
Produced by Ned Chaillet (an excellent drama director) and presented
by John Walsh, this week's offering dealt with the literary laws of
copyright. ''A look at the implications of the rights revolution which
is extending copyright until 70 years after an author's death.'' And do
you know that while mortality morbidly fills my thoughts a great deal, I
have never really given much thought to the notion of my writing as
something I might own beyond the grave.
It used to be the case that after 50 years of not being alive, your
work was up for grabs, so now it's 70, and I don't really see an extra
couple of decades making all that much difference. Unless you believe in
heaven, in which case, you could look down and see your grandchildren
benefiting a bit longer in recompense for all that time you spent in
front of the computer, instead of taking their parents to the park.
Theatre directors favour dead writers because they don't talk back to
their misinterpretations during rehearsals, because they're tried and
tested, and because it means more interviews for them. Fair enough, in a
world of necessarily monstrous egos.
But the written word, at the risk of sounding hippy-romantic, seems to
me inherently more democratic -- a meagre printing still delivers the
goods. A reproduction of a Botticelli, doesn't.
When I lived in Edinburgh my social world was populated by socialist
painters who quite rightly charged thousands for their work. That meant
they had to sell to Scottish Sloanes a good deal of the time. As a
playwright I didn't need one rich person but lots of well-off bums on
the theatre seats. Well, cushions, we're talking the old Traverse here.
Anyway, William Boyd made me rethink a little. His line was that
copyright should remain with the author and his descendants forever and
ever. In every other occupation, he argued, one is allowed to hand on
the fruits of one's labour when you've shuffled off the old mortal coil.
And it's not an illogical line -- but the niggle I have about it is
that while, of course, I want a parity in the deal, I can't really feel
protective over descendants I know nothing about. Maybe the strangers
who will read me cheaply will be nicer people . . . We all have aunties
we would swop for that person you haven't met yet.
Michael Holroyd took the opposite tack. Nightmare relatives of the
deceased genius forbidding a biographer, not just the right to quote but
even disallowed to paraphrase, were conjured up -- and I changed my mind
again. (There is nothing more reliable than my inconsistency.)
Then we got a literary agent saying that books were too cheap, and
that people would not moan so much about expensive hardbacks if they
couldn't buy their Dickens and Austen for a song. My socialist heart
objected to this -- but then all nice liberal leftist writers need their
agents to be bastards -- keep the nice people for the bedroom and let
free the contract-negotiators to do what a businessman has to do . . .
I don't think Sue Lawley liked Richard Hoggart much. Being
consistently aspirational middlebrow, she found it difficult to
interview-empathise with a man who's socialism embraced cultural beauty,
indeed, a man who sees that the two are inextricable. His choices on
Desert Island Discs seemed to rather perplex her. No brass bands, but
Ella Fitzgerald and Auden. Dear, dear, who does he think he is?
I can imagine her interviewing William Blake, mentioning how the
paparazzi had photographed himself and the wife starkers in their garden
-- I bet he would have continued chatting to the angels. In Who shall
Bind the Infinite (R4) Jack Shepherd played the poet and visionary who
was considered insane by many, and proved them wrong. Don't think he had
an agent.

EVEN allowing for the fact that almost half last month's sharp decline
in the UK's visible trade gap with the non-EU countries was accounted
for by oil and erratic items, the performance was encouraging. It was
much better than markets were expecting though in the event there was
little or no reaction.
A feature of the trading picture in the month was the sharp bounce in
exports to North America. These have been virtually stagnating for much
of this year as the US economy performed sluggishly, at times raising
fears that economic recovery was faultering.
It is to be hoped that the upsurge in exports to North America is a
sign of better things to come. However, it is always dangerous to take
one month's figures in isolation, something Government ministers tend to
do only when the outcome has been favourable.
One month's trading performance, albeit showing a useful decline in
the deficit, does not change the overall picture which is that of an
underlying deterioration in the UK trade position.
In the third quarter as a whole, for example, the non-EU deficit was
the highest since the first quarter of 1993. Excluding oil and erratics,
the highest since 1988.
Despite the present slowdown in the economy -- a pause for breath in
some people's eyes and possibly something more serious in the eyes of
others -- analysts mostly believe that exports should continue to grow
strongly on a pick-up in global economic activity.
The problem is that import growth will very likely outpace this as UK
investment grows and consumer expenditure rises. On this scenario, the
underlying trade deficit will continue to widen, though not dramatically
so.
No action
PRUDENTIAL can at last put its lengthy brush with the regulators
behind it following the decision by Lautro not to take any disciplinary
action against the group.
Now it will be able to develop better relationships with the
regulators. Under its previous chief executive Mick Newmarch, who was
forced to resign last January, Prudential had a confrontational attitude
to the regulators and was angry when Lautro launched an informal probe
into its selling practices 18 months ago.
For long it had insisted rather arrogantly that it had not mis-sold
pension products, much to the annoyance of others in the industry, but
later did make an undisclosed provision in its accounts to cover
compensation to victims of mis-selling. Now there is little doubt that
its practices left something to be desired, though in the light of
changes Prudential has made Lautro has decided not to take disciplinary
action.
Many companies which have felt the lash of Lautro's censure will no
doubt consider Prudential has got off lightly and would have liked the
giant of the industry also to have suffered.
But it is doubtful if the bad publicity of fines imposed on such
companies as Norwich Union and Scottish Widows will have a lasting
impact on their sales.
Wild West
GIVEN its reputation, it is hardly surprising that there was hardly a
Scottish fund manager in sight when Vancouver Stock Exchange hit town
this week.
Brokers, accountants and lawyers turned up at the Exchange's
presentations in Edinburgh and Glasgow at which Vancouver attempted to
demonstrate how it had cleaned up its act -- but not fund managers.
The venture capital-orientated Stock Exchange, which is finding it
hard to shake its Wild West reputation, says many Scottish investment
managers will, at one time or another, have invested in Vancouver.
One of the Vancouver party expressed his belief that, although
Scottish fund managers might do business with the Stock Exchange, they
might not wish to be seen to be doing business with it.
On the one hand, who can blame them? The Vancouver Stock Exchange's
bad reputation, which it claims is being perpetuated by journalists in
British Columbia who have made their careers out of highlighting its
scams, is international.
Therefore, why cause investors sleepless nights if the investments in
Vancouver are so small that they would not have to be listed separately
in results' statements anyway.
On the other hand, there is an argument that, if as the Exchange
claims there has been a fair amount of Scottish investment in Vancouver
companies, the fund managers concerned should be willing to stand up and
be counted.
Players on the Vancouver Stock Exchange are well aware that it will
take some time to persuade potential investors that their market is now
well-run -- and follow-up visits to Scotland will probably involve
meetings behind closed doors.
They are also anxious to stress that Vancouver offers some emerging
Scottish companies, such as hi-tech pioneers, a somewhat unique
opportunity to raise capital. Therefore, the exchange is looking for a
two-way flow of funds, benefiting both the Scottish and Canadian
economies.
In British Columbia, it is very difficult to get a neutral opinion on
the Vancouver Stock Exchange.
There have certainly been radical changes which, on the face of it,
point to a better-run market.
But only time, and the Vancouver Exchange's performance record, will
demonstrate whether this is actually the case.
And maybe then Scottish fund managers will be willing to put their
mouths where some of their money allegedly is.

UNDERWORLD, it is pleasing to report, were not perfect. No live band
ever is: spontaneity curtails note-for-note renditions of the last
album. Although this is a truism in the world of indie-guitar rock,
Underworld inhabit the dance arena where a Personal Appearance is too
often an excuse for simple miming over a pre-recorded Digital Audio
Tape.
So Underworld, who really do use their machines as instruments, fouled
up a few times in their immense three and a half hours on stage. But
only pedants cringed at the occasionally bumpy arrival of a new rhythm
into the already bulging mix.
Rhythm is what they do best. Karl Hyde chants rhythmic vocals live on
stage. These are captured in the sampling machines of Rick Smith, who
loops and manipulates them into the sinously chugging syncopated base
beats created by Darren Emerson. They disappear, only to re-emerge half
an hour later in mutated form: a fondly remembered motif to bring the
happily bouncing audience back to the semblance of reality.
While such self-indulgence would rightly be derided as aimless waffle
in a guitar band, Underworld turn it into a virtue on the dancefloor.
This is techno as she should be sung. With every style of the techno
canon available to them, and augmented by DJ Darren Price wielding his
killer beats from behind the turntables, Underworld are an act which has
evaded the backwater known as Detroit minimalism.
Acid, house and even psychadelic guitar melded together as Smith and
Emerson, grinning to each other from behind their machines, decided
which song or sound to titivate with next. Yet beyond the keenly crafted
dancefloor experience, this was a performance bursting with humour,
passion and, above all, creativity.

PRUDENTIAL has escaped censure over its pension selling practices by
the regulatory body Lautro, the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory
Organisation.
After a lengthy investigation, Lautro said it had expressed concerns
to Prudential ''regarding certain aspects of its approach to such
(pension) sales''.
The company had acknowledged these concerns and stated that it was
reviewing its pension transfer business in the light of new guidelines
and had ceased to operate the policy which had given rise to the
concerns.
As a result of this Lautro decided that ''disciplinary proceedings
were not appropriate.''
The concerns related to members of company pension schemes who
transferred to personal pension policies. Prudential sold the latter on
an execution-only basis without giving any advice, though in practice it
is thought sales representatives did steer people away from doing this
where it was obviously unsuitable.
Now the group will only handle transfer sales where they actively
advise clients to switch into personal pension policies. Only in a small
number of situations is it worthwhile opting out of a company pension
scheme.
Prudential is reviewing past sales in line with the guidelines set out
by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the umbrella regulatory
body which is insisting that people given poor advice be identified and
compensated if they have suffered financial loss as a result.
Prudential has been under investigation since April 1994 when Lautro
launched an informal inquiry, much to the annoyance of the group. It
became a formal inquiry last March.
The conclusion means that Prudential's resignation from Lautro is
confirmed. The group was the only major company to refuse to join the
Personal Investment Authority, the successor to Lautro and Fimbra, the
independent financial advisers' body, though many others did so only
reluctantly.
Instead it opted to be directly regulated by SIB but it could not
sever its links with Lautro until the latter's investigation was
complete.

THEY'RE saying that out of every bad experience must come something
good but it would take an open mind to believe that the horrors of the
Second World War concentration camps could create anything positive.
For composers Hans Krasa and Viktor Ullmann, the atrocities of war
were very real. Held in Terezin, a holding camp for Jews en route to
Auschwitz, these two composers were able to turn a potentially
dehabilitating situtation in to a hot-bed of cultural activity and their
operas, Krasa's Brundibar and Ullmann's The Emperor of Atlantis,
collectively known as The Terezin Operas, are the latest project for
London-based Mecklenburgh Opera.
Brundibar, straight out of the Czech operetta tradition and performed
by 40 local school pupils, may appear on the surface to be a poignant
tale of two young children trying to help their sick mother, sung in
enchanting little tunes and accommodating some delightful ballet scenes.
The underlying political ramifications however cannot be disguised as
the central character Brundibar, an egotistical organ grinder, emerges
as a tyrannous Little Hitler. Ultimately good does triumph over evil and
the moral for mankind to rally together against oppression resounds.
Musically, the score contains a spirited mix of Czech tunes easily
mastered by the well-drilled schoolchildren.
Contrasted with the seemingly whimsical nature of Brundibar, Ullmann's
The Emperor of Atlantis, denied a performance at Terezin, paints a very
different picture. Atmospherically set in war-torn Atlantis, the figure
of Death battles with the evil Emperor until he eventually accepts that
even he is only human -- further images of Hitler and the then political
situation.
Here, Mecklenburgh unveiled an impressive cast, dominated by bass
baritone Dean Robinson in an excellent portrayal of Death. Musically,
this score serves as a melting-pot of Schoenberg, Mahler, Bach, Kurt
Weill and even the hint of a Wagnerian leitmotif.
The Paragon Ensemble sounded slightly unsettled under the unfamiliar
baton of Mecklenburgh's Anne Manson though the quality of singing and
dramatic impact of the piece surpassed any minor problems in the pit. A
valuable insight into the Terezin experience and an important addition
to the operatic repertoire.

Music
GARY KATZ, legendary producer of Steely Dan and Lowell George, does a
decent line in gossipy anecdotes, so it's a shame that the first 20
minutes of his hour-long conversation with Ken Garner at the GFT is
dedicated to a rather reverential line of questioning regarding
recording techniques.
However, Katz, a witty and likeably self-effacing talker, throws in
enough jibes about A&amp;R men (''young gunslingers'') and major label
''fatcats with cigars'' to lighten up even this, somewhat leaden,
introduction.
Katz is anxious to dispel the myth of the producer's ''magic touch'',
explaining that he chose his career after watching a friend's record
being successfully produced by someone who knew ''Jack'' about music.
His usual response to inquiries about his ''secret'' is to shrug his
shoulders, thus absolving himself of the heavy responsibility valuable
insider information brings.
It's refreshing to see such an acclaimed and respected figure
under-sell himself -- he claims that his job at ABC was the result of a
letter to the company director which began: ''It is more of a pain in
the ass for me to have to write this, than it is for you to read it.''
It would be nice if this were true.

Music
THE quantity of music and theatre -- and visual art, come to think of
it -- from Canada that we have been enjoying over recent years is
disproportionate to all preconceptions of the country. If you haven't
caught up with this former child star of that nation, who has reinvented
herself as a straight-talking rock chick (and impressed Madonna enough
to be signed to her label), it is time to tune in.
This set, drawn entirely from the Jagged Little Pill album was melodic
''intellectual intercourse'' as she puts it. Her fiesty response to
sexual politics goes well beyond the riot grrl rage that Polly Harvey
was once mistakenly bracketed with, but that don't mean it's tame. Her
(UK) debut single You Oughta Know captured the flavour and caught the
attentive imagination. The Glasgow audience was -- of course -- word
perfect. ''What are you so angry about?'' Alanis wondered. But there is
plenty more where that came from. She is more penetrating, if you'll
pardon the expression, on Catholicism than the Material Girl herself and
her take on late twentieth-century existence -- as defined in All I
Really Want, Ironic, and the oxymoronic Hand In My Pocket -- pretty much
sums up the zeitgeist.
The band is sharp and dynamic, all chaps, 50% bare-chested, and with
one of the most inventive rhythm sections it has been my pleasure to
listen to in a long time. Her own harmonic playing is, well,
unexceptional in technique but Beefheartian in commitment, and her
vocals, while derivative of a long list of earlier stylists, are perfect
for the delivery of those incisive lyrics and nagging melodies. The 10
Day Weekend will have introduced us to no bigger star.

Jenny Geddes's spirited moment of retaliation against intolerance and
oppression was the catalyst for a civil war which ended in the death of
a king. Murdoch Lothian considers an attempt to impose an Anglican
hierarchy on Scotland's national church
SCOTLAND sweltered in the heat-wave. The heavens were brass and the
earth was iron. There was a shortage of food in the capital. The price
of oatmeal hit a new high. It was the summer of 1637.
On the morning of Sunday, July 23, a large and distinguished
congregation were assembled in St Giles' Cathedral. It was a few minutes
after 10 o'clock as the Bishop of Edinburgh and the Dean of St Giles'
processed to the pulpit. The Bishop mounted the pulpit and the Dean took
his place at the reader's desk below. The Dean began to read from the
new service-book, which was being introduced that day in all the kirks
in Scotland.
There were mutterings of protest from the congregation. The Bishop
asked for quiet and instructed the Dean to read the collect of the day.
At that pandemonium broke out.
''The women . . . got up on their feet crying and shouting and casting
their stools at them . . .'' wrote Rev David Calderwood, an eyewitness
to the riot. Another observer, Lord Rothes, wrote that ''the church was
immediately emptied of the most part of the congregation and the doors
thereof barred . . .'' In the street the riot grew wilder, the church
windows were broken and it was only with difficulty that the Bishop of
Edinburgh reached the sanctuary of his lodgings.
After lunch the Bishop with a ''great guard'' retured to St Giles',
''the doors were closed and no women permitted to enter. Mr Alexander
Thomson did read several collects of the Service Book a little before
his afternoon's sermon, and if the church doors had not been well-fenced
with the Magistrates and others, he had questionless been pulled out of
the pulpit with violence,'' wrote Rothes. It was the only time that the
Service Book was used in St Giles'. After the service the Earl of
Roxburgh in his carriage collected the Bishop from the church, and they
were chased home by the angry mob and a hail of stones.
The following morning six or seven women were arrested and locked in
the Tolbooth. They were examined, then the charges against them were
dropped. Their names were not entered in the minute-book of the Bailie
Court. They were released from custody.
The women's release angered King Charles I in London. The riot had
been directed against The Book of Common Prayer, which Charles had
ordered his Scottish bishops to produce under the watchful eye of the
Archbishop of Canterbury. Neither the Scottish Parliament nor the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland were consulted by Charles and
his advisers before the introduction of the book on that fateful Sunday
morning. The intention embodied by the new prayer-book was to ally the
Kirk more closely with the Church of England and ultimately to impose on
Scotland's national church an anglican hierarchy, in which the King is
Head of the Church, not just a member.
In the words of G M Trevelyan: ''Neither nobles, people nor clergy had
been consulted in the direction of their national worship. The new
ritual drawn out by the help of our Scottish Bishops, had received the
finishing touches at Lambeth and had been sent down ready-made for use,
like a sack of English goods. It was an order in no veiled terms that
Scotland should be Scotland no more.''
The popular rising against the introduction of the new Book of Common
Prayer sparked off a conflict which was to lead to the National
Covenant, the Bishop's War, the Civil War and the beheading of King
Charles.
This account of the riot in St Giles' lacks a major and much-loved
element, which is to be found in the traditional story. The name of
Jenny Geddes has become so firmly attached to the thrower of the first
stool in the tumult that it may seem perverse to leave her out of the
narration.
The fact is that Jenny Geddes's name does not appear in the
contemporary records of the affair. Indeed, the Rev James Kirkton in his
Secret and True History of the Church of Scotland (written in 1690)
emphasises the anonymity of the Dean's assailant: ''. . . an unknown
obscure woman threw her stool.''
Jenny's name appears for the first time in 1661, 24 years after the
riot. ''The immortal Jenet Geddes'' is mentioned in the Edinburgh
news-sheet Mercurius Caledonius as presiding over a kail-wives bonfire
celebrating the restoration of Charles II. However the writer omits to
explain why Jenny is immortal. In 1670 John Phillips of London in
Baker's Chronicle identifies the stool-thrower of St Giles' as ''Jane
(or Janot) Gaddis (yet living at the time of this narration).'' In 1694
Rev Samuel Johnson describes her as ''the old Herbwoman of Edinburgh''.
These various strands were repeated over the years and in 1830 Sir
Walter Scott wove them into his tapestry, Tales of a Grandfather. The
leader of the women in St Giles' battle-royal was now described as ''an
old woman named Jenny Geddes, who kept a green-stall in the High
Street''. Scott collaged fact and fiction into a stirring and memorable
picture. It is Scott's version of events which seems to be most widely
known and circulated.
Kail-wife Jenny Geddes and her stool are key elements in the popular
narrative, as are the words which Scott gave to her to hurl with her
stool at the Dean: ''dost thou say mass at my lug?'' This comes from
Lord Rothes's contemporary description of the tumult, when ''a good
Christian woman . . . betook herself to her Bible in a remote corner of
the church.'' A young man behind her ''began to sound forth 'Amen' ''.
She wheeled about and slapped him across the face with the words: ''Is
there no other part of the Kirk to sing Mass in, but you must sing it at
my lug?''
Sympathetic accounts have tended not to overembellish the story beyond
describing the chief protagonist as ''kail-wife Jenny Geddes of the High
Street''. However opponents have confused the story with remarkable, but
unsupported statements. Kirkton's Secret and True History was first
published in 1817, the editor was episcopalian C K Sharpe. The word
''unknown'' was edited out of the line, ''an unknown obscure woman threw
her stool'' and Sharpe added a note: ''This poor woman's name was Geddes
. . . it is said that she had done penance on the stool of repentance .
. . on the sabbath previous to the exploit.''
Mark Napier, in Memorials of  Viscount Dundee (1859) further
embroiders the story: ''Geddes, replete with holy zeal, which her
preceding Sabbath's rebuke for fornication had doubtless much inflamed .
. .'' He retells the story of Geddes presiding over the Restoration
bonfire and suggests that she was drunk at the time. He adds
gratuitously, ''the same influence, doubtless, under which she had
obtained the immortal distinction of being the mother of the Scotch
Covenant.''
However, it was Lord Glencorse, Lord Justice General of Scotland, who
in 1866, having considered the evidence, summed up the whole story
succinctly in a sentence. He devised the inscription for the plaque
which may be seen today on the floor of the Moray Aisle in St Giles':
''Constant oral tradition affirms that near this spot a brave Scotch
woman Janet Geddes on the 23 July 1637 struck the first blow in the
great struggle for freedom of conscience which after a conflict of half
a century ended in the establishment of civil and religious liberty.''
Artist Merilyn Smith, now Professor of Fine Arts at John Moores
University, first heard the Jenny Geddes story when she was a girl at
school in Arbroath. The images of the women's riot and the throwing of
stools at the Establishment were to stay vividly with her. It was not
until the early 1980s that she began to consider a sculpture for Jenny
Geddes. Smith's project had to mature for some ten years before she
encountered the enthusiastic support of Joan Hughson, of the Hughson
Gallery in Glasgow, who encouraged Smith to continue her historical
research and to develop her plans.
As in most of her work, Smith distilled her extensive research to the
essence, discarding fiction and fantasy while retaining the humanity of
the events, until she arrived at the prime feature of the Jenny Geddes
story -- the stool. In January 1992 Smith designed the wooden prototype
for the stool which was to be cast in bronze. In consideration of the
leading role taken by women in the Edinburgh riot, a subscription list
for Scottish women was opened in February to fund the project. Some 40
women responded, the money was raised and the stool cast in bronze in
April.
Meanwhile Joan Hughson had introduced the project to the Very Rev
Gilleasbuig Macmillan, the minister of St Giles'. He, in turn, put the
idea before the Elders of the church, who decided that they would
welcome the bronze stool into St Giles' and that it should be sited in
the Moray Aisle beside the 1886 plaque to Jenny Geddes. The Cutty  Stool
was officially unveiled after the midday service on August 23, 1992,
when eminent poet Iain Crichton Smith read his poem -- The Stool --
written especially for the occasion.
At the time The Herald's art critic, Clare Henry, wrote: ''The bronze
sculpture could have been stridently historical, political, feminist,
nationalist. It is none of these. Rather, Smith, whose work is
characterised by the reduction of the obvious to the quintessential --
saying more with less -- has chosen to make a ''portrait'' of a stool.
It is a work of the present informed by the past. It proclaims both
dissent and conviction, a forceful celebration of a simple, defiant
gesture.''
Smith, at the unveiling, quoted from Ramsay MacDonald's words to the
students of Edinburgh: ''Our capital must not be a dead museum, neither
must the ghosts of the past be banished from our streets. We must be
careful of the soul and spirit of the people who created that
greatness.'' The Cutty Stool sits silent in the twilight of the Moray
Aisle gently glowing bronze-green. It is a signal of latent strengths, a
glimpse of the soul and spirit of the women of St Giles' who in a moment
of retaliation confronted and routed intolerance, imposition and
oppression.

EXPORT AWARDS
SCOTLAND'S growing success in exporting medical equipment around the
world has led to medical supply companies winning two of the three top
business export awards presented last night by Scottish Industry
Minister George Kynoch.
The gold award for outstanding achievement in exports in the large
company category went to Ethicon of Edinburgh and Livingston which has
increased its workforce to 1700 due to the success of its sales of
sutures and surgical wound closures.
More than 60% of Ethicon's turnover is exported, with its top five
markets being Germany, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, France and Turkey. A further
9% increase in exports is forecasted for the year ahead.
Hi-tech company Creos International, which was only set up in Dalgety
Bay, Fife, in 1989 by Scottish and American scientists, won the small
company section gold award for its four-fold increase in exports of
radiographic X-ray generators which are regarded as world leaders.
The judges said they were very impressed not only with its fast growth
but also its commitment to a high level of research and development.
Medium-sized company gold award winner was Bridge of Weir Leather
which supplies top quality leather to car, furniture, and aircraft
manufacturers. It recently won a #3m order to cover seats for Renault's
top-of-the-range cars, and is also putting in seats in British Airways
latest range of 747s, 777s and DC10s.
Exports have trebled in the last three years, and employment almost
doubled.
The awards scheme is organised by the Scottish Council Development and
Industry with sponsorship from British Airways and Scottish Trade
International.
Industry Minister George Kynoch told business leaders at the awards
ceremony in Glasgow's Forte Crest Hotel last night that Scottish
companies and Scottish products have never been more competitive, and
that Scotland was exporting more manufactured goods than ever before.
''Over the years 1992 and 1993, Scottish manufactured exports rose by
almost 20% to reach their highest ever level of #11.5bn. This is about
#32,000 for every employee -- more than the UK as a whole and more than
Japan.

SIBERIAN huskies, which can pull 15 times their own body weight, will
reach speeds of up to 25mph as they race through the Glenisla forest in
Angus next spring.
The two-day spectacular is the first British Cup sled race.
The dogs will be glad to see snow on March 2 and 3. If there is none
the teams will swop their sleds for three-wheeled rigs that can be
pulled over rough terrain.
Places in the team for the 1998 Winter Olympics will be assessed at
the event.
The British Sled Dog racing champion, J-M Littman, yesterday took a
team to the forest to start preparing them.
He said: ''Glenisla is the perfect location because it has one of the
highest snowfall averages in the UK.
''Racing through a forest is a marvellous feeling. The energy and
enthusiasm of the dogs rubs off on everyone around.''
Husky racing has become increasingly popular since it was introduced
to Britain 15 years ago. More than 100 teams compete in the top events.
It differs from many sports in that men and women compete as equals.
J-M Littman said: ''It is also probably the only sport where your
ability to show love and affections to your dogs is a must.''

Part One: Missouri
When Herald writer John Linklater set out to trace an ancestor, his
quest was on a grand scale. It took him from an Airdrie farm to El Paso
County, from modern Scotland to a harsh frontier land where waves of
Scots immigrants were carving out their own particular dreams on a
hostile prairie. Here and on the succeeding two pages, he recounts his
journey into a personal history and the deep emotions it aroused
I had fallen for the myth. There never was a Twelfth and Vine, except
in that song
I would circle him slowly, and imagine what kind of a judge he might
turn out to have been
I might as well have been trying to trace an ancestor from an
obliterated herd of buffalo
Montage by: MYRNA MacLEOD
FROM the Greyhound Bus Station in Kansas City it should only be a
short walk over to Twelfth Street and Vine. Bearings are important in an
urban grid so close to prairie. For orientation Twelfth and Vine would
be a useful meridian. I wanted to stand on the same corner that Little
Richard sang about: ''Kansas City, here I come.'' It would be the
reference point for a search over the next two weeks. I was trying to
trace a judge.
There were a couple of hours to kill before my bus out to Topeka, the
Kansas State Capitol where I learned ahead that they had some records on
my judge. I booked the ticket and checked in a bag. A few blocks east
brought me to The Passeo, the boulevard that marked the boundary into
black ghetto. This was a sleepy Sunday morning and the only thing to
threaten it were hallelujahs and enthusiastic clapping coming from a
church. I followed along Twelfth Street. There was no Vine.
Inquiries were met with amusement. I wasn't the first to have bought
the myth. ''There never was a Twelfth and Vine, except in that song,'' I
was told by a thin old man, illustrating with the map of his lined palm.
''You want Eighteenth and Vine.'' Six streets south, signposts confirmed
the ''Historic 18th and Vine District'', though souvenir hunters have
left nothing to mark the now desolate end of Vine Street itself. This is
where Count Basie played cinema organ at the Eblon Theater and later
formed his band in the Cherry Blossom Club.
Here Coleman Hawkins blew in and accepted the challenge of the saxes
from local hornman Lester Young. Charlie ''Bird'' Parker first gigged
here and so did Ben Webster. This is where Kansas City Jazz was born.
The Depression and Prohibition had no jurisdiction. It was one of the
precincts of ''Open City'' tolerated by ''Boss'' Tom Pendergast's
administration until he was indicted for tax evasion in 1938. Ernest
Hemingway, who learned his prose style as a cub reporter on the Kansas
City Star, returned here to write A Farewell To Arms and miss his first
Pamplona fiesta since 1923. This was Kansas City Jazz, blues, gangsters,
prostitutes morse-coding invitations with nickels on windows, gambling
joints and drugs. ''If you want to see sin, forget Paris,'' was the
word. ''Go to Kansas City.'' They covered hyperbole by calling it ''The
Paris of the Plains''.
Lieber &amp; Stoller's 1952 song lyric, recorded much later by Little
Richard and Wilbert Harrison, had commemorated this scene, but used
artistic licence because Eighteenth Street and Vine didn't fit the
metre.
That was not the only fraud being played on the district. Up Vine
Street first glance encountered what looked like model conservation.
From the Negro Baseball Leagues Museum it all looked convincing: the
Monarch Cab Company, The Roberts Hotel, the Eblon Club with its little
glass foyer, Loretta's pawnshop, Mull's barber shop and a news-stand all
standing in a time-warped line, refusing to allow the thirties to die.
The hotel offered ''steam-heated rooms for men'', ''hot water and
electricity''. Fly posters supported Roosevelt's 1934 Democrat campaign,
admission to the Eblon was 50 cents for the double bill, and through the
windows of the Rogers Pharmacy I could see just a plaster wall four feet
from the glass and a few empty paint tins. The whole street was a
cosmetic fake.
They had built it the month before I arrived, for filming that had
just finished. Director Robert Altman had arrived in his home town to
negotiate a deal with City Hall and the Eighteenth Street Merchants'
Association who had been campaigning for years to reconstruct the
corridor.
They appeared as extras in Kansas City, the feature he was shooting on
a local gangster, known by the name of Sel'om Seen and played by Harry
Belafonte. Now the city was left with a movie-set replica of a once
vibrant area that had been ''cleaned up'' in the sixties. A pure facade.
Call in the metaphor department. Here was a warning, if ever one was
needed, about what America will do to mess with history, its own or
anyone else's. As I was returning to the bus station I saw a plaque
marking Twelfth Street and Vine, an intersection that never existed
outside of a song lyric. It was stuck in the middle of a park.
At my cut-price room in the Historic Suites of America, a converted
warehouse in the former Garment District of Kansas City, with a
swimming-pool in an empty lot over the road and two freight wagons
parked incongruously round the corner on disconnected tracks, I had
picked up leaflets for the ''authentically restored'' Jesse James Farm &amp;
Museum at Kearney, Missouri, and the Jesse James Bank Museum (''robbery
re-enactment during spring'') in 15-miles-distant Liberty, on the site
of a broad-daylight bank job only tenuously connected with the James
Gang.
The invitation read: ''Step back in time as you walk through the bank
office and into the vault, which looks as it did in 1866.''
That was what I was trying to do, step back by instalments to 1868. It
was in this year that Judge Jim Orr came to America. He was the judge I
was trying to trace. In Kansas City, with a population that had
increased eight-fold to 32,260 over the previous decade, he would have
seen the paddle-steamers heading down the Missouri River through the
Hannibal Swing Bridge, seen the congested freight depots and the
railroads heading west and south along the former pioneer trails, the
Oregon, the California, and the Santa Fe.
My man, Judge Orr, had been making the long journey south-west into
the very heartland of America from Boston. He was heading for the
village of Medoc, Jasper County, Missouri. He wasn't yet a judge in
1868. He was six years old and he had just emigrated with his family
from Airdrie.
For a long time I had wanted to make the search for the judge. I first
learned about him from a yellowing newspaper cutting which gave the
obituary of his father, also James Alexander Orr. This was in a wooden
trunk of papers, letters, and photographs that my grandfather left. The
1904 obituary gave the judge as one of the surviving children. That's
all that I knew about him, except for a couple of letters, found in the
same box.
The first was dated August 31, 1896. It was family news sent from
James Alexander Orr to his younger brother who had moved to Edinburgh.
He mentioned his son. ''James married and lives in Colorado,'' he wrote.
''He is a lawyer.'' The second was a hand-written copy of a letter to
Airdrie, dated October 26, 1904, and had obviously accompanied the
cutting of the newspaper obituary. It was from the judge breaking the
news of his father's death. It was addressed from the County Court,
Colorado Springs. My grandfather's note, on the back of the letter,
identified the source as Judge Jim Orr. The judge was his cousin.
I wanted to follow the path taken by his family when they first
emigrated from Scotland, to Missouri and three years later over the
State line into south-east Kansas. The judge could wait for the moment.
I would circle him slowly, and that would give me more time to imagine
what kind of a judge he might turn out to have been out in Colorado at
the turn of the century. What kind of lawlessness would have kept him in
business? Would he have served as a circuit judge? Would the record show
him to be a hanging judge? Another Roy Bean, or a society judge?
First, I wanted to exhaust all that could be learned about the family
he was with when he emigrated from Airdrie.
So, it was a roots thing. The paradox about the American attitude to
history, casually inventive and exploitative, is that everybody there
understands possessiveness about roots. Identity is the great WASP
vacuum, so genealogy has become one of the popular sciences. Every
library devotes enormous resources to catering for a demand that is more
a psychological necessity. Every State, virtually every county, has
historical societies and subscription periodicals. Private agencies
undertake research assignments for substantial fees.
Inevitably, most of these searches work through the generations
backwards towards the old countries. Mine would be in the opposite
direction.
The Orrs are my mother's family. They came from Airdrie. Drumbathie
Farm is now divided between St Margaret's High School with its playing
fields and the Airdrie Leisure Centre with its blaize football pitches.
For 20 years, until the lease was finished in 1870, it was where the
Airdrie racecourse was sited in one of the fields with its stone
grandstand just above the family farm steading.
Drumbathie Road, following the course of the old Edinburgh to Glasgow
Road past the farm, is all that remains today of the name. That was the
Orr farm.
In the 1861 census, in the parish of New Monkland, James Alexander
Orr, the judge's father, gives as his occupation, farmer of 45 acres at
Drumbathie. He didn't own it, or its ironstone and coalmining works,
diversifying what had once been flax production for Airdrie's early
weaving industry. It would end life as a dairy farm in the early 1970s
with the Gibsons, into whom one of the Orr daughters had married.
Whatever the state of Orr family fortunes by 1868, they were
dissipating.
James Alexander's mother was still living as a widow at Drumbathie
Road House, and he had five brothers, one of whom was my
great-grandfather. They would all have had a claim on a division of the
estate. Two of these brothers had moved to Missouri, and there was a
purchase of land there in Jasper County in 1866. It was to Jasper County
that James Alexander Orr took his family, seeking a bigger opportunity.
There was a story I learned that he had been a rider in the Missouri
land grab. He was 37, and had with him his wife Anne from East Kilbride,
three daughters aged between 17 and one, and two sons of whom the future
judge was the eldest. Another daughter would be born two years after
they settled.
This family added to what Professor Tom Devine has called ''the
Scottish haemorrhage''. Between 1825 and 1938 Scotland lost 2,332,608 of
its population who made new lives overseas. That is almost half the
current population, and it represented an emigration rate that latterly
overtook even Ireland's. It was the highest proportional loss suffered
by any industrial society in Europe, compounded by the highest recorded
loss of skilled, professional, or entrepreneurial talent. The United
States was the destination for the majority.
It was a mid-nineteenth century brain-drain, and it accounts for the
remarkable level of success among Scots in America. They went in droves.
Robert Louis Stevenson, who travelled on a transatlantic ship out of
Glasgow, was moved by comparison to call himself an ''amateur
emigrant''.
Finding Orrs in Missouri was not going to be difficult. The problem
was that there were too many. The morning after I arrived in Kansas City
I had the radio tuned to a local station as I leafed through the Greater
Kansas City Southwestern Bell phone book. Between Orpin and Orrell there
were 98 listings for Orr, and one of them was coming over on the radio
as a winner of a phone-in competition. This didn't give me much of a
lead, but it did adjust my pronunciation. In America it was ''Oar''.
She was Amy Orr, and the book had unlikely Duanes and Dwights, an
Elmer L Orr, an H Dayton Orr, an L Homer Orr and a Leroy L Orr. There
was a Colonel Wayne P Orr, retired, a Randy Orr, and a Rocho Orr.
Whatever else, these people had assimilated. The book had four James
Orrs. This preliminary survey did not exactly encourage the random-swoop
approach, and it gave at least an inkling of what I might be up against
on this quest.
A quest for what? Kinship? Distant cousins? Or a story about a judge?
At the Missouri Valley Collection of the Kansas City Library they were
dubious. I had run into a State-line problem. If this James Alexander
Orr went on to settle his family in Kansas, and himself died there as
his obituary confirmed, they were unlikely to keep records. ''You won't
find much unless he was very distinguished or got himself outside the
law,'' I was told.
The obituary described him as ''sober, industrious and law-abiding''.
These were not considered very promising attributes, and this remote
descendant had to agree.
On microfilm they could only offer me an obituary for a John Orr. He
turned out to be an Ozark Mountain songbook revivalist. This was not
looking good. The library had 42 volumes of passengers arriving in
American ports between 1850 and 1882, and they were exclusive to German
immigrants alone. In the 179 volumes of the American
Genealogical-Biographical Index they had 42 James Orrs, none of them
mine. The Index was exactly what it said, an index. Presumably, the
actual biogs would have stretched halfway across the Great Plains.
I might as well have been trying to trace an ancestor from an
obliterated herd of buffalo.
After mornings and afternoons of abortive research I would leave the
library and cross to City Hall, a 1936 building of almost Stalinist
proportions with its four stone friezes depicting the rise of Kansas
City from cowtown to early twentieth-century metropolis.
The reality of downtown Kansas City was boarded up and decaying, a
series of skyrises and gaps made into parking lots, as though someone
had built the place and forgotten why. Down by the river, freight trains
crawled through with a solemn grind on rusted tracks that whistled and
groaned like a giant meat-slicer.
Back at my hotel I had been making phone calls, trying to find more
promising avenues for my research on James Alexander Orr. The break came
when I got through to the Kansas State Historical Association in Topeka.
It took them only seconds to check files and come back with the
question: ''James Orr, born 1831 Scotland, died 1904 Severy, Kansas?''
That was him. ''You're in luck. Our card catalogue shows that we have a
biographical sketch in a narrative history from the Elk County
Historical Society.''
I was on the Greyhound Bus out to Topeka.

The pack wondered if they were losing
the plot
John Davidson and photographer Niall McInerney in Paris find fashion's
biggest names cruising in neutral gear
IS IT really asking too much? One might imagine that in a week of
million-franc fashion presentations here in Paris from the biggest names
in the fashion firmament, one might just glimpse the innovative shape of
things to come.
The reality, however, is that big-name designers have stuck to an
understandable view of fashion, wearable by real women right now. There
have been some memorable clothes, of course. But for an industry which
relies on arbitrary re-invention just to sustain itself, it is strange
that its established stars should chose to cruise for a season in
neutral gear.
Is no-one prepared to edge fashion forward? Perhaps that is what Karl
Lagerfeld was trying to do in his collection shown on Tuesday. There was
a modernity about its simplicity and discipline. But for every
cleverly-seamed dress, there was one other quite ugly. And for each
really interesting jacket there was one which we could have survived
quite happily without.
Chloe (which he also designs) harked back to the seventies with its
pretty floral dresses and big-brimmed floppy hats. These were totally in
the spirit of Chloe -- and though not without charm, hardly new. Which
is more than can be said for the electric brights which opened and
closed the show. These -- and an electric lightbulb trompe l'oeil frock
-- should have been the subject of an energy conservation programme.
Christian Dior promised -- and delivered -- absolutely nothing new.
Instead, we quick-stepped back in time to the golden years of Hollywood
glamour for an extraordinary cavalcade of just about every type of
evening outfit which might have been found hanging in the wardrobe
department of any major film studio.
Cue Dietrich tailcoat and short-short shorts. A close-up, please, on
those Garboesque satin pyjamas. But only Cinemascope could do justice to
those not-so-little screen-siren slinky evening gowns. You've got the
picture, and yes -- it's one which you've seen many times before.
The safari jacket, set to be a major trend for next summer, is just as
deeply embedded in the repertoire of Yves Saint Laurent style as Le
Smoking and the peacoat. And out came a definitive example in his own
collection: beige, belted, and absolutely beautiful. This was just one
fine piece in a strong showing which received a standing ovation for its
reliable chic.
No-one expects Valentino to write a fresh manifesto for fashion in the
new millennium. He's far too busy flattering his loyal clientele with
thoroughly refined clothes.
And that's just exactly what his show was all about. Delicate tiers of
ruffled chiffon skirted a simple knit dress, no more highly coloured
than the froth on a cappuccino coffee. Patterns of coral and sea shells
spread across a fish net appeared first as pretty print dresses -- later
reworked in intricate beading on nude chiffon evening gowns. It was all
expertly executed -- the very thing to take the ladies out to lunch and
on to cocktails.
Britain's much-loved maverick, Vivienne Westwood, has been showing in
Paris for several seasons. But this time around she presented her most
realistic -- and least really creative -- collection ever. No outsize
bum pads; no bare buttocks. And shoes just about as sensible as any
footwear for Miss Westwood is ever likely to get.
There were some wonderful outfits -- like the worsted jackets and
coat-dresses cut with a full-swing back. Her remake of an Edwardian
bathing suit in white muslin, lavishly trimmed with lace, was cute. As
were the lady-like accessories (matching gloves and handbags) for every
last outfit. But a full-blown deep-green taffeta ball-gown gave Linda
Evangelista the look of a giant savoy cabbage rolling down the runway.
By concentrating on a refined vision of elegance, with her customary
wit and normally irrepressible wackiness held in check, the audience
could concentrate all too easily on any shortcoming in fit and finish.
It was a good but not great collection.
To the prodigiously talented John Galliano, the show is everything.
His clothes are just a starting point, to be magnified by a quirky
choice of venue and a full-blown theatrical production. Season by season
he is evolving into the Cameron Mackintosh of the runways.
His audience sat on the stage of a dilapidated theatre amid discarded
backstage debris and racks of discarded theatrical costumes. There was
wonderment in the air -- in other words the fashion pack wondered if
they were losing the plot, or whether indeed there ever had been one to
grasp.
Models in white broiderie anglais were partnered by a gospel choir not
entirely sure what all this could be about. Something more obvious will
be coming along shortly, perhaps. And, in a flourish of frothy tulle
tutus and satin bustiers, the invitation was clearly to the dance. This
was a vision of Degas for the pop video generation.
Despite rumour of a terrorist threat to target yesterday's Chanel
show, it proceeded in a puff of smoke -- white smoke, from which emerged
a stream of models wearing Dayglo-trimmed reworkings of the classic
Chanel vocabulary in pure brilliant white.
This was the finale of a fast-paced and colourful show. And it marked
the end of a week when there has been nothing virtual about the reality
of fashion in Paris.

LIz Taylor considers the romaticising of the medieval age and a
breathtaking new exhibition in which chivalry, patently is not dead
SIR Andrew Lloyd Webber is a knight in shining armour as far as the
organisers of a breathtaking exhibition currently on show in the Laing
Art Gallery, Newcastle, is concerned.
The exhibition is called Knights: Myth, Legend, and Romance -- just
the sort of thing to draw the crowds -- and those who go will not be
disappointed because, by displaying paintings, sculptures, tapestries
and artefacts from major galleries and museums, including the Tate, the
National Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum, it traces the
eternally fascinating history of knighthood.
Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber comes into the story because he has loaned
four magnificent William Morris tapestries to the exhibition.
When his musical Cats was playing in Newcastle last year, he visited
the Laing and was much impressed by it, so much so that he agreed to
lend his tapestries to the present exhibition. Because he is a collector
of Pre-Raphaelite art, he bought the medieval-style tapestries last year
at Christie's. They form The Quest of the Holy Grail series, designed by
Sir Edward Coley Burne-Jones, and woven at William Morris's Merton Abbey
Tapestry workshop between 1890 and 1894.
The biggest of the tapestries, The Attainment of the Holy Grail by Sir
Galahad, Sir Bors and Sir Percival, was made in four parts and measures
an impressive 6.82 metres long by 2.36 metres high. The other three are
The Arming and Departure of the Knights; The Failures of Sir Lancelot
and The Failure of Sir Gawaine. They are claimed to be the most
significant tapestries woven in the nineteenth century.
The exhibition shows how the Middle Ages have been romanticised by
artists and writers for centuries. Adrian Jenkins, the organiser, has
gone to a great deal of trouble to explain the background to knighthood
and feudalism in a booklet on sale at the gallery which helps the lay
visitor to understand the significance of the display.
Among the exhibits are items of armour, including a half suit of
seventeenth century armour from Bamburgh Castle. Even earlier is an
ivory mirror case carved with two knights battling to win the favours of
ladies on a battlement behind them. It is French and dates from the
fourteenth century so the depiction of the knights would be accurate and
contemporary.
Date from the fifteenth century is a triple portrait of the saints
Gregory, Augustine and Maurice, with the latter, the warrior saint,
dressed in knight's armour. This picture, by a member of the circle of
the Master of Liesborn, who was known to be active around 1460, has been
borrowed from the National Gallery.
It was in the nineteenth century, however, that the fascination with
knighthood reached its full flowering and the exhibition has a picture
by the early pre-Raphaelite painter Daniel Maclise (1806-70) showing a
knight swearing an oath on a peacock before the admiring ladies of a
court. There is also a portrait of Sir Walter Scott's knight hero,
Quentin Durward, by Charles Edward Halle who died in 1914, because the
knightly theme was taken up by writers as well as by artists.
Even more lusciously romantic are paintings by Burne-Jones and
Rossetti. The Burne-Jones shows Lancelot being prevented from pursuing
the Holy Grail by an angel because he is guilty of adultery with
Guinevere, and a Rossetti watercolour shows St George marrying the
Princess Sabra, whom he rescued from the dragon.
The theme of the knight saving the fair lady also occurs in a painting
by John Everett Millais entitled The Knight Errant in which an
armour-clad hero is cutting the bonds of a naked young woman who is tied
to a tree. When this picture was first shown in 1870, it caused an
outcry because of the nudity of the fainting female.  Critics said that
because she was not a nymphet, she was too old and wrinkly to be exposed
so explicitly and that the knight was not a gentleman because while he
was cutting her bonds, he kept the visor of his helmet up!
Other exhibits include a view of the romantic stronghold Dunstanburgh
Castle by Turner, and a most unusual racing trophy in the form of two
mounted knights, the Black Prince and King John of France. It was
awarded to the winner of the Doncaster Cup in 1853.
The exhibition runs at the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, until
February 18 next year, and admission costs #2 for an adult and #1 for a
child. After Knights closes, the Lloyd Webber tapestries are to tour
other art galleries in the North East of England before returning to the
Laing in late 1996. Try not to miss seeing this exhibition, for it is
well worth the trip.

MANY of the fashion world's strangest encounters involve the Celtic
fringe. And having encountered three of its members, I found myself at
Natacha -- an intimate and desperately fashionable little restautant --
just behind Helena Christiansen, her new boyfriend, her mother, and an
assortment of friends.
The charm of Natacha is the consistency of welcome whether you are a
gorgeous supermodel, or the last shattered remains of a Scottish fashion
editor with a trio of Irish reprobates.
The evening's floorshow was impromptu. A middle-aged midget, in
flowing scarves and a belt buckled tightly around her forehead, was
grabbing unsuspecting men and dragging them round the room in tango
style. Finally she clambered atop her table and gyrated through a
striptease routine in Helena's honour. Not a pretty sight.
When Helena's mother visited the downstairs toilette, the supermodel
persuaded friends to hide behind huge velvet curtains with the intention
to jump out on a bewildered Mrs C. But an excruciating 20 minutes
elapsed and the joke had gone decidedly off the boil. Whatever could
Helena's mother have been doing all that time, we speculated. Karen from
Dublin explained: ''She's surely been fixing her make-up. If I'd had to
come back and sit alongside Helena Christiansen, you would not have seen
me for a week!''
Our photographer for this season's fashion frenzy, Niall McInerney, is
a fully-fledged member of the lunatic Celtic fringe, and took it upon
himself to go backstage and advise little Kate Moss on her diet.
''I just told her that she wasn't eating properly'', he explained. ''I
said that she should be having porridge every morning -- the kind made
from big flakey oats. She's staying at the Ritz, and you can get
anything there. But they had to send out specially for the right kind of
oats. Anyway, she's on the porridge now . . . and it's keeping her
regular.''

* A DIFFERENT kind of a knight figures in a collection of papers being
offered for sale in a book sale by Sotheby's in Bond Street, London, on
October 27.
The lot consists of papers that belonged to Prime Minister Arthur
Balfour and they are all concerned with spiritualism whch enjoyed a
craze in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Apparently Prime Minister Balfour was a keen spiritualist, as was his
friend, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and it is thought that they were both
influenced by the writings of an Edinburgh woman called Catherine Crowe,
who published a book entitled The Night Side of Nature in the 1830s.
The papers in Sotheby's sale cast an unusual light on Balfour the
politician and are quite authentic because they were acquired by the
vendor's grandfather who was a peripatetic clocksmith based in
Haddington. One of his jobs was to maintain the clocks at Balfour's home
at Whittingehame, East Lothian. On a visit there after Balfour's death,
he was given the papers and also a silver-topped walking stick that
belonged to Balfour and which is included in the sale lot. Because the
papers are fairly tattered and water-stained, the estimated price is
only around #300 but the Edinburgh-based vendor assures me that the
material in them is ''fascinating''.

Tom Buchan, poet and dramatist; born June 19, 1931, died October 18,
1995
ON Wednesday a friend phoned to tell me that the poet and dramatist,
Tom Buchan, had been found dead, out in the woods, up in Forres. As my
friend said: ''He had all that energy. He contributed so much. Whatever
he did, it wasn't nothing . . .''
We need to mark his passing, and perhaps we will be able to do so
through some kind of get-together in the months ahead. In the meantime,
I cannot give a full picture of the man and his work but offer the
following based on my personal impressions.
I first got to know Tom Buchan in the early seventies when he joined
up with a group of us to read poetry in the Glasgow streets. His book of
poems, Dolphins at Cochin (1969), was already published and at first it
seemed surprising that someone already accepted by the Scottish literary
establishment should come forth and read with us. Had he not been an
English teacher? Didn't he live up on Hyndland Road? He turned up to
read with a Fidel Castro cap on his head and satirical mischief playing
around his long-jawed face.
Tom made no secret that much of his life was lived in rebellion
against his father, a Protestant minister with repressive attitudes.
None the less he had a mystic sense of life, which led him on the one
hand towards the Iona Community, on the other to India where he lived
and worked for a while presenting travelling theatre -- fragments from
the Mahabharata. The memory of India, particularly its land mass, its
surrounding hills, the sense of it as ''mother'', never left him.
Glasgow-born, he had been educated there and at Aberdeen Grammar
School, before going on to Glasgow University where he graduated in
1953. He taught in Scotland and India before becoming a full-time writer
in 1971.
In 1972, his first play, Tell Charlie Thanks for the Truss, was
presented at the Traverse Theatre, directed by Michael Rudman. It told
the story of a revolutionary army whoinstead of guns used sexual power
gathered from an orgone box strategically placed in the Highlands of
Scotland.
It was a great blast at Scottish male uptightness, including a
wonderful portrayal of Mad Mitch. With a band on stage and the action
moving from dialogue to song and dance, quirky humour to social comment,
he had invented a new stage format.
This came to full fruition some time in the following year when he was
teamed up with the then emerging Billy Connolly to create the legendary
Great Northern Welly Boot Show for Clyde Fair International, a Glasgow
arts festival. The show filled the King's, and, though Billy was
undoubtedly the star, there was no doubting the sturdy power and
inventive liveliness of Tom Buchan's writing.
Later the Welly Boot Show was performed at the Edinburgh Festival by a
co-operative company. It received great acclaim and was an inspiration
to many people. Tom Buchan did not manage to follow up on the success,
however. To do that he would have needed to form a theatre company, and
this was not easy for him. As it was, John McGrath and 7:84 (Scotland)
inherited the Buchan format and used it to further legendary effect.
Writing to me in 1993 about the various manuscripts of his plays, Tom
Buchan said: ''The one thing that doesn't exist is a proper script of
the Welly Boot Show, and if you ever laid hands on one I'd be interested
to hear about it. Probably has some historical interest. I notice
commentators seem to think that modern Scottish agitprop started with
The Cheviot -- not that I give a f***. My own debts are really to Joan
Littlewood's productions of Brendan Behan's plays, which never get put
on, of course.''
If only someone in the theatre had been willing to take him on and
keep him occupied! As it was, Tom Buchan, finding no response by which
he could survive, either physically or spiritually, not in established
culture, began to move off into experiments with psychedelics and UFO
mysticism.
His short period as editor of the literary magazine Scottish
International showed how far he had travelled from the cultural squares.
For better or for worse. There were new influences on him then. He
seemed to have imbibed some political paranoia. He came to tell me that
he and I were on a CIA hitlist. What on earth for, said I.
It is difficult. Some people say of Tom Buchan that he was a great
promise that was never fully realised. But perhaps it depends how you
look at it. Here are his own words from his letter to me of June 1993:
''I'm just off with a posse of ex-Glasgow Findhorn freaks to my
spiritual home on the Scoraig peninsula (where I lived for some years
and where Alice-Emma now Sundara forsooth has a meditation centre and my
eldest Lawrence a house) for a laid-back midsummer rave-up in the middle
of nowhere.
''Baldy, 60 Grandpa Buchan still has a great (mainly theoretical)
fondness for sex, drugs and live state-of-the-art rock'n'roll! To tell
you the honest truth, Tom, I've never been so bouncy. Findhorn keeps me
up to scratch in all departments and when I get pissed off with it I
head for the hills as always.''

William Gregor MacKenzie FLS, VHM, born June 14, 1904, died October
16, 1995
BILL MacKenzie was a plantsman and a horticultural gentleman. The
gardening world will be the poorer for his passing. He was born in 1904
in the head gardener's cottage at Ballimore, Loch Fyne, Argyllshire, the
estate of Colonel John McRae Gilstrap.
Bill recalled that as a boy he never wore trousers until he was 13 or
14; up until then it was the kilt. He was interested in plants from an
early age and from this a lifetime love of plants evolved. He remembered
well the hedge of Desfontania spinosa from Chile and Peru growing at
Ballimore, which kindled his interest in plants.
He started his career as the vegetable boy at Ballimore, but after
seven years his interest in plants took him to the Royal Botanic Garden,
Edinburgh as a student in 1928.
Later while he was a deputy foreman in the propagation department,
there followed what he described as ''a marvellous time'', for it was
then that many new plants were being introduced into the garden from the
great Scottish plant collector George Forrest from China and also from
Frank Kingdon Ward and Joseph Rock.
Bill had a vivid memory of these golden days for it was his job to
look after the seeds of Meconopsis, Omphalogramma, Primula, Lilium,
Nomocharis, and Rhododendron which were arriving for the first time into
cultivation.
Many of the plants nursed from seed by Bill from the great collectors
can still be seen in the botanic garden today. He developed a love for
alpines and was pormoted to assistant curator in charge of the Alpine
and Herbaceous Department.
It was because of his love for alpines that he became one of the
co-founders, in 1933, of the Scottish Rock Garden Club. He became the
club's honorary life president of which he was greatly proud, and was an
active member of the club until his death.
In January 1946, like so many great Scottish gardeners, he moved south
to become curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden, where he remained until
his retirement in 1973. His interest in plants was a lifelong passion
which he continued into his retirement at Frimley Green, Surrey.
In 1961 Bill was awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour, VMH, from the
Royal Horticultural Society, an honour only held by 63 persons at any
one time, representing the 63-year reign of Queen Victoria. He was proud
of this honour for it was accorded to him in the same year as it was to
the Queen Mother.
His name will be well remembered for the yellow Clematis which bears
his name -- a chance seedling he noticed in the garden of Valerie Finnis
who propagated it from cuttings and gave it his name. Like the man, the
plant is now known throughout the world.
Bill MacKenzie never lost his soft Scottish accent, or his enthusiasm
for plants which he freely passed on to many budding gardeners. He was a
great plantsman with as many rare and endangered qualities as the plants
he nurtured into cultivation.

Henry Roth, novelist; born February 8, 1906, in Galicia, died on
October 13, 1995, in Albuquerque, New Mexico
HAD Henry Roth, who died at the age of 89, written a number of novels,
one could try to place the work by comparing it with the achievements of
others. But we have only a single precocious masterpiece, Call It Sleep,
published 60 years ago, and now generally recognised as the most moving
and lyrical novel to come out of the Jewish immigration to America
before and after the turn of the century.
Even if we take account of the history of Roth's by now famous writing
block, or the fact that during the last 20 years of his life, crippled
with rheumatoid arthritis, he was still able to write no fewer than six
volumes of autobiographical fiction entitled Mercy of a Rude Stream, the
power of his first book unavoidably stays in the mind.
It is clear that the success of Call It Sleep, first published in
1934, became obsessive for Roth too. His descriptions of the bitter
struggles of immigrants, haunted by a sense of loss and isolation, were
rooted in his own experience. The novelist was born in Tysmenica in the
Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia in 1906, but within a couple of
years the family had emigrated to New York. Roth was brought up in a
slum on the Lower East Side.
The family situation in Call It Sleep recalls those childhood years. A
fearful but imaginative boy, David ventures from his mother's embrace
(and his father's beatings) on to the city's mean streets where he
encounters the goyish ''other'' -- often in the form of tough Irish kids
who jeer at his Jewishness and then beat him up.
Somewhat misleadingly, as Alfred Kazin has pointed out, the ''tough''
spoken English of the street kids and the heavily accented, stumbling
English of the immigrants are rendered phonetically, while the Yiddish
spoken at home is translated into exceptionally pure, even poetic
English.
Yet the novel was unabashed in its treatment of the gamier, sexual
side of immigrant life. Unlike other ''proletarian'' writers of the
time, Roth was consciously a modernist. His earthy subject matter was
paired improbably with a prose style deeply influenced by James Joyce
and by the poet Hart Crane.
It is interesting to note that, despite his own left-wing politics,
Roth found his strongest detractors among communists who were unhappy
with the visionary lyricism and apolitical treatment accorded the slums
of his story.
With the aid of an advance from Maxwell Perkins, the Scribner
publisher famous for his editing of the novels of Thomas Wolfe, Roth
embarked on a second but ''proletarian'' novel which was to tell the
story of a worker who loses an arm in an industrial accident and becomes
a communist organiser. The choice of subject matter was regarded in
literary circles as being a kind of artistic suicide.
The hiatus in Roth's writing was remarkable. (One reviewer wrote that
it made Wordsworth's famous block ''a mere blip or glitch in
comparison''.) Perhaps apocryphally, it is said that Perkins's dislike
for Roth's early drafts of the proletarian novel was a key factor in the
blockage. More importantly, however, the novelist came to understand
that he could not subordinate his ''detached imagination'' to his own
radical passions.
Perhaps the sheer weight of achievement and psychological anguish
muted Roth. In any event, he lapsed into decades of literary silence.
The hero in Mercy of a Rude Stream, in asides to his computer which
regularly interrupt the narrative, reflects upon his failure to follow
up his early triumph: ''Ah, how could you have let that life, all that
life and configuration and trenchancy and conflict, escape you?''
It was the rediscovery of Call It Sleep that helped to unblock Roth as
a writer. It was reissued in paperback in 1964 and received a front-page
review by Irving Howe in the New York Times. As a result, the book sold
well over 1,000,000 copies and enabled Roth to give up a menial day job,
and to travel widely, before settling in the gritty town of Albuquerque,
New Mexico, in a mobile home where, in 1979, he began his vast project
of autobiographical fiction that was to become, 15 years later, Mercy of
a Rude Stream.
The title was taken from Shakespeare's Henry VIII where it refers to
the fall of a once proud king from the heights of public attention into
the depths of emotional turmoil. But when it was suggested to Roth that
such a plot reflected his own life, he immediately disclaimed any
greatness and, with typical self-effacement, retreated behind his thick
spectacles.
Though hardly a novel in any traditional sense, Mercy of a Rude Stream
is a consistently interesting autobiographical document, richly
evocative of its time and place.
The first two volumes -- the rest have yet to appear -- continue
chronologically the story of Call It Sleep's protagonist (renamed Ira
Stigman), following him as he moves from the insular Jewish world of the
Lower East Side to the ethnic mix of 1920s Harlem. The writing is
sometimes slapdash, but on the whole the reader does not miss the
incandescent language and imagery of Call It Sleep: the plainer and
rather old-fashioned language of the later work is colourful enough in
the sections that count.
Earlier this week, re-reading Mercy of a Rude Stream, I was often
reminded -- despite the vast differences in style and ethnic background
-- of Roth's affinities with Thomas Wolfe and James T Farrell. It is
astonishing to realise that Roth was not much younger than those
long-dead and now, I suspect, seldom-read writers and that like them,
but at an advanced age, he had been able to tell us vigorously and
convincingly what it was like to be a boy living in the first part of
this nearly exhausted century.

Dorothy Ann (Dolly) Collins, composer, arranger and gardener; born
March 6, 1933, died September 22, 1995
THE appearance of Shirley and Dolly Collins on EMI's Harvest label 25
years ago caused consternation among the youthful cognoscenti. What were
these two rather matronly figures, who looked for all the world as if
they had just stepped off a farm in a Thomas Hardy novel and who played
and sang ancient folk songs, doing mixing with the long-haired,
testosterone-driven heroes of ''underground'' music?
The answers, with hindsight, can only be an admirably eclectic stance
by EMI (Harvest also was home to the weird and intermittently wonderful,
Third Ear Band), and equally admirable vision. Listening now to the
Collins sisters' second album for the label, Love, Death and the Lady,
one finds it rewarding, fresh, and yet timeless, which I suspect is more
than can be said for its Harvest contemporaries such as Deep Purple's
Concerto for Group &amp; Orchestra.
The Collins collaborations not only perplexed the heavy rockers, they
divided the easily rattled folk scene, half of whom questioned the
legitimacy of having piano, pipe organ, and a small early-music group
accompanying Shirley's pure traditional singing; the other half voted
Love, Death &amp; the Lady Melody Maker Folk Album of the Year.
Shirley Collins had already sparked controversy by recording, in 1965,
the now highly collectable Folk Roots, New Routes, wherein guitar-legend
Davy Graham spun blues, modern jazz, and what we now call world music
influences around her very English singing, and would go on to record
the classic folk/rock album, No Roses.
While her younger sister built a reputation as one of England's finest
traditional singers (albeit a maverick), Dolly was building her
expertise in classical music.
It was Shirley's then-husband, Austin John Marshall, who suggested
that Dolly arrange some of Shirley's songs. The combination of voice and
a replica seventeenth-century flute organ on their first album together,
1967's Sweet Primroses, was striking, with Dolly's rustic-baroque
arrangements showing an understanding of traditional music that found
her later compared with Vaughan Williams.
The following year Dolly was commissioned by Radio 1 to compose a folk
song suite, Anthems in Eden, written for a six-piece early music consort
directed by David Munrow, and featuring Shirley's singing.
Harvest signed them and the sisters began a period of intense touring
all over Europe. The attractions of travelling and concerts eventually
palled for Dolly, though, and she decided to make her living from her
other love, gardening.
She did, however, remain active in music, orchestrating Peter
Bellamy's acclaimed ballad opera The Transports in 1977.

CUSTOMERS at a Little Chef restaurant on the southbound carriageway of
the A9 can enjoy drinks with their meals. But a sheriff yesterday
decided that another Little Chef just across the road must remain dry.
The two restaurants at Balhaldie, near Dunblane, are in different
council areas.
Stirling District Licensing Board granted a restaurant licence for the
southbound one last year. The Perth and Kinross Board refused a similar
licence for the northbound premises on the grounds that it would
encourage drivers to drink.
Rejecting an appeal against that decision, Sheriff John McInnes ruled
that the board had acted competently.
He added: ''It may be a matter for comment that the Stirling board
reached a different decision in circumstances which may well have been
remarkably similar. But that another board took another view is not a
sufficient basis for the appeal to succeed.''

Charles William Hutton, architect; born July 28, 1905, died September
11, 1995
THE architect Charles William Hutton, who died aged 90, was born in
Annan, Dumfriesshire. His father was a ship-building engineer and Hutton
spent his early years in Sheffield, then in Glasgow, where he attended
Bellahouston Academy.
His early talent for art was encouraged at Bellahouston and he
subsequently became apprenticed to a Bolton architect and successfully
gained a scholarship to study architecture at the Liverpool School under
Professor Charles Reilly.
The emphasis in the school was on the classicising tendency of the
Ecole des Beaux Arts, an influence which is evident in his war memorial
at Rawmarsh, Yorkshire, which was built in 1926. However, this work also
presaged a more progressive tendency which would find its expression in
his subsequent London works.
From 1929 to 1936 he was chief assistant to Doctor Charles Holden.
Holden, steeped in the English Arts and Crafts tradition, was also
heavily influenced by his visits to Holland, Germany, and Scandinavia
which brought a clarity and power of expression, evident in the large
number of underground stations which the practice created for the
Piccadilly Line and elsewhere.
Perhaps the best-known of these is Arnos Grove Station, a composition
of brick, reinforced concrete, and metal windows, in the form of a drum
upon a block, which powerfully exhibits the influence of Gunnar Asplund,
the most important Swedish architect of the twentieth century.
While he was heavily involved in the creation of underground stations,
Hutton's most notable work from this period with Holden is the
spectacular Senate House at London University.
During the late 1930s Charles Hutton returned to Liverpool to teach in
the Architectural School and he also taught in what is among the most
internationally known of architecture schools, the Architectural
Association of London.
The level of respect in which Hutton was held is indicated by his
subsequent position as deputy to Sir William Holford (later Lord
Holford). He worked with Holford to create munitions factories in Kirby,
Walsall, and Wolverhampton. Just before the end of the War, Hutton
opened his own practice in Welwyn Garden City.
His subsequent practice created the Murphy Radio Factory at Welwyn,
the Oxford University Field Station, and a number of notable industrial
and school buildings. In all of these, Hutton's translation of
traditional idioms and building techniques into carefully balanced and
more contemporary forms is apparent, his eye for detail always to the
fore.
In his late years, Hutton spent a great deal of time at the Art
Workers' Guild which he had joined in 1951. He was made Master in 1968,
and worked for a further 20 years as the guild's honorary architect.

THE Scottish Sports Council is to commission research into the
environmental impact of speedboats using Loch Lomond, it emerged
yesterday.
The #7000 study follows the preliminary findings of scientists from
Glasgow and Stirling universities which link high levels of toxic waste
in the loch to discharge from the outboard engines of watersport craft.
The team found concentrations of benzine poisons from petrol which can
wipe out marine life in some stretches of the water. At the same time it
reported a 60% increase in speedboats on the loch since 1989.
Yesterday, in a letter to The Herald, the Scottish Sports Council,
which is against proposed by-laws to restrict speedboat use, expressed
concern over the findings.
Chief executive Jim Breen said: ''We welcome the research and any
environmental monitoring which reconciles sports' impact on both the
community and the environment.
''However, what we don't know exactly is the source of the pollution.
The problem could come from pipe outlets, roads by the loch or from
other vessels. Not all speedboat users are irresponsible.
''There may be a number of ways in which hydro-carbon boat emissions
can be contained if necessary. An option might be national 'health
checks' for boats or the use of alternative fuels such as propane gas.''
He said the council backed speedboat by-laws in principle but that the
current proposals, among them speed limits and restrictions on certain
outboard engines, would ''not necessarily'' reduce boat levels and would
penalise other sports.
The council's research, which will use the same Rowardennan-based
team, led by Dr Colin Adams, who were behind the preliminary findings,
will examine the effect of power boats on fish in the loch.

ONE of the most abiding memories of Tom Clarke as Labour's Shadow
Secretary of State for Scotland was the moment he laid siege to Downing
Street. It was his finest hour.
Bristling with indignance at some slight from the then Scottish
Secretary, Ian Lang, he rose to his feet in the Commons and, accompanied
by the mass ranks of Scots Labour MPs, stormed out of the chamber
promising to take his grievance personally to the Prime Minister.
Out they strolled en masse and bustled up Whitehall like a rampaging
All Blacks scrum with the scent of victory in their nostrils. Never
again would a Tory Minister treat them with such disrespect. Never again
would he and his class warriors be patronised by a Tory Grandee.
Passers-by, even to this day, can remember the hum as, under the breath,
they sang that anthem of defiance, ''Here we go, here we go, here we
go''. An impressive sight, as every member without question has burned
the midnight oil to memorise the lyrics.
At their head was the strutting diminutive figure of Mr Clarke, his
face set stern, his eyes burning with injustice. Never had the nation
seen such a ferocious sight since Chaplin's Great Dictator goosestepped
in celluloid.
As they turned into Downing Street the security gates opened, a
parting of which Moses would have been proud. Young police constables
who had only read about Sidney Street stood helpless, gaping in
amazement. No-one spoke as the sound of their tread rose to a crescendo.
The heirs of Keir Hardie, Maxton, McLean and the Red Clydesiders, read
in tooth and claw, had at long last reached their goal.
In the stilled silence the rap on the door echoed frighteningly like
the first shot on the Somme after Christmas.
''We demand to see the Prime Minister'', they chorused, teeth barely
visible behind the pursed lips.
''I'm afraid you can't'', said a No 10 flunkey, politely.
''We demand it'', they roared back. Would Lenin have tolerated such
effrontery? Would Uncle Joe not have swept this capitalist apologist
from the doorstep. Would Che and Fidel not just have stormed the
building?
''It's impossible'', came the stuttered reply. ''You see the Prime
Minister is in Japan. Did you not know?''
It was a salutory experience from which Mr Clarke has learned much.
Now he has taken to writing first to flag-up his intentions. Like in the
run-up to the Shadow Cabinet elections, Mr Clarke sent postcards to his
colleagues to tell them who he was; some even received as many as three.
Dear Tony,
I hope you don't mind my using your Christian name but I feel as if I
know you. You may think this missive is presumptuous but I just wanted
to remind you that I was once Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland. I
was treated unfairly, especially by the press. They used to say I was
the sort of chap who got sand kicked in his face. Well, I want to refute
that. From where I come from, Monklands, we don't have any sand. So
there.
It is all a myth perpetrated by Michael Forsyth's hard-hearted Tories.
We are kindly people in Monklands and as a former provost I can testify
to this. We look after our families and would be black-affronted if
anyone said otherwise.
I hope you enjoyed your holiday in Italy and visiting the Tower of
Pisa. I have not been there myself but as you will see from the photo on
the front of this card it must be a bit like Coatbridge. We also have a
number of lean-toos. All the best, Tom.
This assiduous courting has paid off. Mr Clarke garnered enough votes
to win entry to the Shadow Cabinet ahead of his more pedestrian
colleagues such as Alistair Darling and Brian Wilson. He will be
spokesman for the disabled and although Mr Blair has no plans to form
such a Ministry it will nevertheless allow Mr Clarke a wide brief to
intervene in debate on transport, education, health, and the economy.
It is said that many of Mr Blair's aides are unhappy at how the
elections have turned out. They wanted more ''modernisers''. But this is
just being churlish. For years elections to the Shadow Cabinet were for
only 12 members. This allowed the Leader the discretion of appointing
another nine. Recently it was increased for a number of reasons
including beefing up the number of women representatives. This political
correctness has brought its own rewards across the board. Now there is a
granny tendency, in the form of Joan Lestor, the bemused tendency in the
form of David Clark at defence and, best of all as she topped the poll,
the feeble tendency in Margaret Beckett at trade and industry. How
Michael Portillo and Ian Lang must be quaking in their shoes. Shadows
indeed.
These are weaknesses the Tories will exploit in the next year in the
run-up to the General Election. Jack Straw is already terminally damaged
following his abysmal performance to embarrass the Home Secretary
Michael Howard over the sacking of Prison Chief Derek Lewis. The kindest
thing to say about Mr Straw was that he was comprehensively routed. This
was Juventus v Rangers. Tony Blair coming to his beleaguered colleague's
assistance was equivalent to Walter Smith stripping to take the field
against the Italians after losing four goals. This was novice politics.
No wonder Mr Blair desperately wants to keep Jack Cunningham in his
team, the good doctor is at least a former member of the Labour
Government although he was only a lowly parliamentary private secretary
to Jim Callaghan. It demonstrates how shallow is Mr Blair's pool. He has
a Gascoigne and Laudrup in the wings -- in the shape of Gordon Brown and
Robin Cook -- but they have yet to turn it on in the heat of election
battle.
These two will be the next Tory targets. Everyone in Westminster is
aware that Blair and Brown, once the firmest of friends, are no longer
buddies. Mr Brown believes he should have got the leadership crown and
remains disappointed. At the same time there is an obsessive rivalry
between the Shadow Chancellor and Robin Cook.
Labour policy will look less anorexic once flesh is gradually put on
the bones. Tory antennae will be sensitive to any perceived differences
between Mr Blair's Big Two especially as their remits of the economy and
foreign affairs, mainly Europe, has many pitfalls. Labour's New Dawn is
still some way off.

To most republicans, the entire charade of royalty is an affront to
ground-floor requirements of justice, equity, and democracy, as Paul
Davis explains. The wealth and avarice of our own royals succeeds in
concocting an obscenity out of the affront
POLITICAL philosopher John Rawls developed the concept of Overlapping
Consensus, applicable when disparate groups find different reasons to
endorse the same prescription or conclusion. The recent preoccupation
with constitutional issues has made a busy worker of Overlapping
Consensus. Europe, for instance, has hacks tickled pink at the spectacle
of a co-operative that encompasses Tony Benn, Teddy Taylor, Teresa
Gorman, and Peter Shore.
The monarchy is a topic that elicits similarly improbable convergence.
Republicanism has sympathisers on the left and on the far right;
left-wing republicans might have felt piqued, indeed, by the example of
the Scottish Young Conservatives, who passed a motion, in 1991, calling
for the abolition of the monarchy.
As political procedure, Overlapping Consensus is a combustible affair.
Secure operation requires that incompatible perspectives are disguised
or downplayed, in the service of a fortuitously shared conclusion. The
ideology of the far right is reviled by the left, who might reasonably
conclude that republicanism under the aegis of the right would not be
worth the candle.
The far right have a reflex antipathy to deference, underwritten by a
militant philosophical stance. This philosophy champions the defensive
and parochial elements of that British working-class outlook which
sociologist Parkin called the ''subordinate value system''. It is a
brutal truth, too wounding for some on the left to face, that swathes of
the Labourite working class occupy this standpoint.
The subordinate value system endorses only that knowledge derived from
the most brutish of brute experience, and the reality of only the most
tangible of tactile things. It is taken to follow that artisans,
technologists, retailers, and businessmen are the denizens of the real
world and the mediators of the knowable. Elsewhere, the notions of
reality, knowledge, and expertise are so much hokum. The creators of the
system cannot, on their own terms, allow that they have such a thing as
a theory of knowledge or a metaphysics; to avow any sort of theory, let
alone an airy philosophical one, is incompatible with their aggressively
anti-intellectual ideology. Nevertheless, the adumbrated, twin theories
of the real and of the knowable shape the responses of the far right.
Rejection of monarchy is a natural outcome of this agenda. Monarchy
involves a constellation of notions that fail to meet the forbidding
requirements of the far right's philosophy. Monarchy upholds the reality
of nation and society, both of which are a derisible flunk in the
right's credibility tests. Monarchy involves national affirmation and
social introspection; since nation and society are a ruse, the parades
and postures are self-indulgent, airy-fairy junk. Monarchy is,
summarily, a cabal of the demons of the far right, a composite monster
begotten of the coveted playthings and fancies of arty-farty
intellectuals and woolly concept-junkies. Since monarchies are
chimerical entities transacting in a chimerical currency, the deference
they demand is an oppressive, authoritarian stitch-up . . . Greetings
from the dominion of Basildon Man, erstwhile Labour voter and nascent
revolutionary.
The left disavow the stony philosophical perspective of the far right,
and sanction the extension of deference beyond its spartan confines. For
the left, the right's bogeymen inhabit a real environment, and engage
enterprises in which the concepts of truth, knowledge, and expertise are
applicable. The theorist or artist is admired and respected as
appropriately as the craftsman, the scientist, or the entrepreneur. But
left-wing republicans demand that deference, prestige, and reward is
extended towards deserving recipients only, a requirement which fuels
one of the left's most fundamental objections to the monarchy.
Deference has a rationality, a logic which the case of monarchy
essentially and dramatically flouts. Consider the concept of a (medical)
doctor. Unlike the concept of a man or the concept of a woman, the
concept of a doctor is deference-laden. Intrinsic to the concept is
context-bound deference towards its instances. The concept at once
contains the grounds and the consequent parameters of appropriate
deference. Doctors are essentially people who have demonstrated an
expertise in the study of human physiology, medicine, and so on. It is
therefore appropriate to defer to such persons when they opinionate on
our medical problems. Their status does not summon deference on
twentieth-century poetry or the economic outlook.
The concept of monarchy is also deference-laden. But the analogy with
doctors ends, crucially, at this point. For monarchy is a
deference-laden concept at once lacking logical ties with
deference-legitimising conditions and recognising no parameters of
deference towards its instances. The titles ''King'', ''Queen'',
''Prince'', and ''Princess'' designate respect-commanding individuals
whose titles are not logically anchored to any conditions that ground
respect. Royals command respect, prestige, wealth, and oracular
authority because they are royals; but they do not become royals through
the satisfaction of logically prior conditions of respect, prestige,
wealth, and oracular authority. Contrast the following statements: ''We
should listen to her because she is the Queen''; ''She got to be Queen
because she (among other things) says things to which we should
listen.'' The first does not entail the second, and the logic of the
monarchy-concept means that the first is true and the second is false.
Similarly, deference towards royals is unbounded by context. Our own
royals are recognisably qualified in little, yet their effusions on any
subject, be it South Bank architecture, Greek vases, or Great Goals of
the Seventies, get heady, sycophantic coverage.
It is the foregoing, ungrounded, and unbounded deference to which
Roseanna Cunningham avers when she protests that the Queen is ''the
pinnacle of the class system''. It is the same phenomenon that Kim
Howells minds when he ventilates his resentment against the deference
summoned by the monarchy. To most republicans, the entire charade of
royalty is an affront to ground-floor requirements of justice, equity,
and democracy. The wealth and avarice of our own royals succeeds in
concocting an obscenity out of the affront.
Many people reach these seemingly obvious conclusions during their
early stirrings of political and ideological awareness. Most of them are
subsequently cowed, partly through the hegemonising effect of the
monarchy itself, into consigning them (along with devolution) to the
archive of loopy teenage madnesses. But some, such as Cunningham,
Howells, Benn, Hattersley, and Tom Nairn, continue to show an affirming
flame.
The powers exercised by monarchs vary enormously, and devotees of the
British monarchy exhort frequently that it has virtually no executive
power. But the inference that our monarchy has no formative influence
involves an elementary and monumental failure of ideological awareness.
Indeed, the potency of the British monarchy requires a paucity of
executive power. The absence of nakedly coercive properties allows the
monarchy to inscribe itself intimately, tactfully, and pervasively into
national life, effectively evaporating into the materials it sculpts.
This insidious immanence is secure inasmuch as limits on coercive power
allow the monarchy to undergo transmutation into an ineffable, seductive
essence. Doctors make do, in their drab corporeality, with context-bound
deference, but the thrilling ethereality of our royals compels heady
supplication.
Left-wing republicans are not unaware that the majority of British
people still want the monarchy. As Christopher Hitchens commented during
Charter 88's 1993 debate on the monarchy, the left have felt
embarrassment, historically, in pronouncing the desires of ordinary men
and women to be mistaken. Perpetually fearing the charge of
condescension, the left has fissured into those who seek to give the
punters what they want and those who seek to extend and alter the
punters' wants. The latter faction are out of vogue, yet it is the
former with whom the condescension lies. Most on the left know that the
populist allures of soaps, tabloids, and royals are an emotionally
barren bulwark of an exploitative social order which requires the
cultivation and satisfaction of those sorry inclinations. Shame on those
who deny this and prefer to hymn the desires of the powerless. For the
old leftist agenda of consciousness-raising and ideological
deconditioning, it is business as usual in nineties Britain.
The far right deride all social and national ceremony, on the shrill,
aforementioned grounds. Republicans of the left have plenty houseroom
for feasts of corporate affirmation. But they envision a particular
relationship between corporate identity and ceremonial celebration, one
very different from that manifested in the monarchical rituals of
Britain. For the left, ceremonial affirmation ought to emerge from
corporate value that is prior, robust, morally vigorous, and firmly
anchored.
Our royal rituals express and tend the apparitional and fetishistic
ingredients of British nationhood. In the royal parade, national
identity is transformed into style; the nation tricks itself out in
female dress, and the concept of Britain, charged with our seductively
ethereal monarch, duly becomes erotically seductive.
Our royal performance offers, through a kind of historical
cross-dressing, a transformed reality in which the transformation points
back to what has been transformed in and through it. Through the
miracles of the aesthetic and the historical imagination, we receive an
ersatz equipoise which soothes the injuries of history and masks the
intractable inequalities of class, race, and gender. In an ideologically
lethal move, our monarchy at once teaches us how to live on the surface
and transmutes the nation into surface. Subjects hone their readiness to
confuse form and content, in order that they might rally around a flashy
but extensionless point.
When the small infant of Jacques Lacan's The Mirror Stage encounters
its reflection in the glass, it imputes to itself a fullness which in
fact pertains only to the representation. The British royal pageant
makes Lacanian infants out of its subjects, in whom the beguiling
representation insinuates itself into the concept of the nation.
In its ham gravitas, its displaced religiosity, and its bloated
baroquery, the British monarchy placates and stultifies its subjects in
the fashion of a torpid religious belief, which, as Mill advised,
afflicts the psyche by ''incrusting and petrifying it against all other
influences addressed to the higher parts of our nature; manifesting its
power by not suffering any fresh and living conviction to get in, but
itself doing nothing for the mind or heart, except standing sentinel
over them to keep them vacant''.

OF all the Southern hemisphere cities, Sydney has the best reputation.
New South Wales's capital is an ideal destination for the jaded
traveller. So much about it is, at first, like any big New World city:
the monorail with irrelevant stops, skyscrapers, restaurants, clubs, and
rush-hour jams.
It is American in its atmosphere, but it benefits from a healthy
cynicism. Aussies, true to their reputation as hard-talking, blunt,
macho men, can spot a bit of bluster from 200 yards upwind. They despise
politicians even more than we do.
Australians see these guys for what they are: an unfortunate
by-product of democracy. If the French explode a nuclear bomb nearby,
the Australian public don't care that their representatives have
''expressed their anger in the strongest possible terms''. Instead, they
put up a huge billboard in the city centre showing a picture of a lady
with a French flag painted on to her bare buttocks, giving a feisty
one-fingered salute. Diplomacy? No thanks mate, we'd rather be honest.
Australian indignation helped save Sydney from modernisation. In the
sixties, the politicians and the planners wanted to ''develop'' the
historic Rocks area of the city. (Develop: Planners' jargon: ''bulldoze
and replace with big roads and skyscrapers''.) Only a massive civil
disobedience campaign stopped them, and the benefits can still be seen
today. The Rocks, instead of becoming developed, has remained a lively
sector of the town.
Even in the rest of Sydney, they have taken some notice of what the
people want. Central Sydney has many tall buildings, the highest of all
is Centre Point Tower. From the top, you can look out over the city and
the massive deep water harbour that surrounds it. Built in the
seventies, and despite the capability and the desire to build higher,
the decision has been made that it will be the highest point in the
city.
In daylight, the harbour becomes a vital link in Sydney's transport
system. Commuters take the ferry to work from all over, as it's both
cheap and quick. At night, water taxis will give a brilliant view of the
city as they get you to and from the outer, fashionable suburbs like
Manly.
Billy Connolly was playing the Sydney Opera House, the tickets for his
eight-night run having sold out within hours. Even among those not of
Scots descent, his following is astonishing: his World Tour of Scotland
series was being shown for the third time this year on national TV.
The setting round the harbour was suitably spectacular. Sitting in the
spring sunshine with a cup of coffee, you can look on to the Opera House
and the Harbour Bridge -- a truly magnificent sight. The bridge was for
me quite boring. I was disappointed that, unlike our best bridges, there
wasn't a gang of ungrateful teuchters blocking it off.
The Opera House is as impressive as you might expect. It has cost an
absolute fortune to keep, but as far as I can make out, nobody minds.
Having managed to get a world-famous icon of twentieth-century
architecture, the cost isn't really an issue. In Scotland, we would have
to put up with the usual moaning: ''How can we justify spending money on
a world-famous landmark when we can't afford to pay for the Gay Drug
Addicts ME Recovery Centre?''
On the walkway surrounding the harbour there are large plaques
inscribed with Sydney-related quotations by famous literary figures. It
was inevitable that at some point, someone would start banging on about
treatment of the aboriginal peoples. Germaine Greer was responsible this
time, having written about the need to sign a treaty with the aboriginal
peoples before she could feel at ease in Australia.
What the settlers did was often unforgivable. You shouldn't dehumanise
people by taking them from their homes and placing them in unnatural
environments. You have only to visit Cumbernauld to see this.
Aboriginals, meanwhile, have become as adept at obtaining compensation
as a Scouser with a cervical collar, believing that any amount of money
will repair the ravages of alcoholism. The aboriginals have adopted an
Irish approach to history: look far enough back in history, and you'll
soon find a reason to feel wronged. With intractable guilt on one side,
and despair on the other, you might wonder if Europeans should have
stayed away. Then you see the Harbour Bridge on one side and the Opera
House on the other. Not only should we not have stayed away, we should
have got there sooner.

Part Two: Kansas
John Linklater continues his search for Judge Jim Orr
He was doing OK, for a man who supervised a family wardrobe made out
of old flour-bags
Hickok shot 85 men in personal combat . . . yet he never faced a
single charge of manslaughter
ALMOST exactly a century ago my great-grandfather was planning a visit
to his older brother in Kansas. They hadn't met in 40 years. ''If we
knew when you were coming we would meet you at Severy,'' was the reply
he received.
Where in the hell was Severy? If James Orr had written to say he would
come to pick up his long-lost brother in Kansas City or St Louis -- even
Wichita, for crying out loud -- you would see it as a gesture of good
faith and warm welcome. The man was making a 20-day trip from Scotland.
Why do I imagine that visit was ill-fated from the outset?
When I first found that four-paragraph letter of July 5, 1896, it told
me plenty about the effect of locust plagues, drought, drudgery, and
carving out a new life from land stolen from the Osage Tribe, on the
Kansas pioneers. It didn't exactly make them an effusive breed.
I went to the Reader's Digest Atlas of the World and found Severy
(population: 357) tucked in the bottom right-hand corner of the map of
the Northern Great Plains. It was east of Wichita on the other side of
the Flint Hills in south-east Kansas, just inside the State borders with
Oklahoma and Missouri. I don't know what my great-grandfather made of
the travel logistics, but it was certainly a challenge. The actual
address was Orr Farm, Fiat, Paw Paw Township, Elk County, Kansas. That
would look dandy on the baggage labels.
His 1896 travel agent would at least have been able to establish that
Severy was on the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, though he
wouldn't then make a song and dance about it. Maybe that was good enough
for my great-grandfather because he wrote back on July 30 to say he
would be arriving in October or November. He didn't specify which year.
I don't blame him.
I never knew if he went ahead with this reunion. The only passports of
his I could find in the box of papers left through my grandfather were
for a business trip to Russia in 1900 and another family visit to
Belgium during the First World War to see his daughter. He was game, but
was he game enough for Kansas?
You have to say this for Kansas. It might not have a single landmark,
it might have a topography that is as flat as its accent, it might be
one big spread of wheat fields that from the air looks like a tiled
kitchen floor, it might be monochrome and when it goes into technicolour
you've got a feeling you're not in Kansas any more, but it has one
distinguishing feature. It is right in the middle.
To get to Kansas from anywhere in the United States you just keep
going inside. If America was an old 78 rpm record, Kansas would be the
hole. It is the epicentre that sucks itself in. This, maybe, is what has
given its image (and it would have struggled otherwise to find one) as
the quintessentially American State, but a quintessential America no
other State would want to be. It is Little House on the Prairie and
gingham. It is Dodge City and Abilene, Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterton.
Superman grew up in Kansas. And so did Dorothy. Nice kids.
Kansas is also a mite impressionable, as I discovered in the November
5, 1897, issue of Severy's leading journal The Severyite. Under Fiat
News it reported: ''Mr James Orr's brother, a millionaire of Edinburgh,
Scotland, surprised him with a visit last week. Mr Orr only stayed a few
days, returning last Monday.''
Nope, it doesn't sound as though the visit was a wild success. Having
apparently spent a year psyching himself up to getting over there, my
great-grandfather might have hung around for more than a few days. Not
even the compensation of being treated as a European millionaire, a
gross exaggeration of my great-grandfather's business fortunes, seems to
have reconciled him longer to the slow rhythms of Kansas rural life.
There was a family anecdote I learned on my own visit that a previous
visitor to the Orr farm had been a bear. It just walked into the
steading, but there is no record of how long it coped with the
hospitality.
Neither was the judge around this family gathering. By the time of my
great-grandfather's visit he had made a bit of a name for himself as a
bright scholar, a budding orator, and a law-school graduate who had
married, left home and gone into practice in Colorado. He wasn't yet a
judge, but he was making the right connections.
In the Kansas State capitol of Topeka I was making my own belated
contribution to the reunion. It was the judge I wanted to find out
about, but first I turned up the microfilm census records on James
Alexander Orr, his father. He was doing OK, for a man who I would later
learn had supervised a family wardrobe made out of old flour-bags.
That's what they wore.
In 1875, when the judge was a boy of 12, and only a couple of years
after the family had moved over to Kansas from Missouri, they had 80
acres under fence, and another 80 acres unfenced. They were growing
corn, castor beans, and oats. Even a little cotton. Twenty years later,
a couple of years before my great-grandfather's three-day visit, they
had 490 acres, under crops and meadow for livestock.
The census provided more detail than you could ever have truthfully
wanted. Imagine my great-grandfather being shown round the place. Here
are 19 horses. These are six cows. That's another 25 cattle over there.
And 30 pigs. It's all in the census. Apple trees: 2. Peach trees: 15.
Plumb trees: 2. Cherry trees: 12. Dogs: 3. Now the family had grown up,
old man Orr was employing a couple of labourers and there was an adopted
daughter, born in New York. All it needed was a Miss Gulch at the farm
next door, and you'd be halfway up the Yellow Brick Road.
''I later learned that every state in the Union, with the exception of
Nebraska, felt disdain for Kansas,'' wrote silent screen star Louise
Brooks in her memoir. She was from Kansas, originally brought up in
Cherryvale, almost the next-door county to the Orr farm in Elk Creek.
When she escaped to New York as a 16-year-old in 1922, she was
embarrassed by a soda jerk mocking her with a story about ''mulking a
kee-yow''. She demanded he give her elocution lessons. But years later
her Kansas accent remained one of the excuses the film studios used to
keep her out of the talkies.
Brooks, the ''Rose of the Prairies'', the black-bobbed beauty
preferred by Pabst to Dietrich for the part of Lulu in Pandora's Box,
was a rebel and a stubborn loner, traits that Kansas provoked in its
women. Daring aviator Amelia Earhart was a Kansan, and so was battling
Prohibitionist Carry Nation, the bar wrecker. Kansas was the first state
to give women the vote, and had the nation's first female mayor and
senator. Kansas women were tough in demanding their rights. They never
could accept dressing in flour-bags.
A map of Kansas gives a glimpse of what they might have been reacting
against. Female names are recorded in every second township. They are
plain, honest-to-goodness names. Homely names, heavens-to-Betsy names,
mythologising settled, domestic lives, pegged like aprons along a State
washing-line: Amy and Edna, Isabel and Pearl, Sharon and Sylvia and
Winifred. They sit along neighbouring townships like Home and Hope,
Lovewell and Paradise, Pleasanton and Pretty Prairie, Arcadia and
Elyria. All of these in a State first known as ''Bleeding Kansas''.
Enough blood was spilt last century to irrigate the prairie for the
first grain, in a dark mud churned up by the hooves of the cattle drives
from Texas, baked and dried into that ubiquitous dust that men would
bite to renew the cycle. Dust swept through every ''Wild West'' town,
narrowing the eyes of the gunslinger into a perpetual squint. Dust and
gunsmoke. Nothing was clear in Kansas, least of all the law.
Take a professional killer like James Butler Hickok. He shot 85 men in
personal combat, an achievement more remarkable for the fact he never
faced a single charge of manslaughter. After he took a bullet in the
back of the head, following a card game, the ill-starred General George
Custer wrote that ''Wild Bill Hickok'' was ''the greatest bad man ever
in likelihood seen upon the earth''. This was an era when ''good'' men
wore US Army uniform to slaughter native Americans and ''bad'' men wore
a badge.
Hickok was a deputy marshall in Fort Riley, Kansas, where over a
century later one Timothy James McVeigh would serve in the 4th-36th
Infantry Regiment and meet the two other men, Terry Nichols and Michel
Fortier, currently held as co-conspirators in the Oklahoma City bombing.
The ethos of the private militia echoes the original ''lawmen'' of
nineteenth-century Kansas. The law, where it existed at all, was
something malleable, to be taken into the hands of the possee or under
the trigger finger of a highly ambiguous hero like Hickok who shot first
and investigated later.
If that represented justice, what employment would there be for a
future judge? When young Jim Orr enrolled at the State University of
Lawrence, paying his way by teaching, he might as well have been
studying Chinese Philosophy for all the opportunity he looked likely to
receive in applying the theory of the law. Except that the young
professional lawyer was primarily an investment agent in the expanding
West.
''Our Jim'', as the local newspapers were calling him, belonged to the
first generation among the pioneer families of south-east Kansas who
could play local boy made good. ''Hurrah for Jim'' was the Elk County
Citizen's generous plaudit when it announced his being chosen by
Lawrence University to represent it in a State oratorical competition.
''May he carry off the honors, is the wish of Elk County.''
These competitions were evidently taken seriously. For the parent
community they reflected pride and satisfaction in the cultural
credibility of its nascent education system. Paw Paw Township had been
settled only a decade or so before, and Jim Orr was one of the first
products to come through it. His sister Agnes and brother John were both
teaching in the county, but no university qualification was necessary
for that. Old man Orr was reported to be freighting carloads of fat
cattle to market at Kansas City, but what really rated was that young
Jim Orr could speak real fine.
''J A Orr of this county won first honors in an oratorical contest at
Lawrence the other day,'' reports the Citizen a year later. ''We believe
this gives Mr Orr more first prizes than has been won by any other
student in the State.'' The Eureka Messenger was even more respectful.
It was calling him ''Professor James A Orr'' when he arrived in that
town to give a descriptive talk on the Chicago World's Fair. It was part
of a tour he was doing, giving talks at $25 an engagement. In Eureka he
drew a ''large audience'' despite the counter-attractions which the
Messenger noted in town the same night: a performance by the Uncle Tom's
Cabin troupe and a rival free concert given by Dr Hunter. Big draws in
Eureka, undoubtedly, but James Orr's ''reputation as an orator was,
alone, sufficient to draw the large crowd he did''.
On graduating at Lawrence he calculated that he might be able to
convert that name he was making for himself into votes. He ran for
County Clerk on the People's Party ticket, which was a brave move
because Elk County was considered a Republican stronghold, and local
politics were fought dirty. Working for the People's Party, and its
campaign for tariff reform, was enough to have ex-Sheriff Richardson
hung in effigy at Elk Falls during the same 1892 election. A candidate
for treasurer, Charles Plowman, found himself compromised by former
employees at his store who gave formal testimony that he habitually
short-weighed merchandise to customers. ''Opposing parties dug deep to
find personal scandal involving candidates,'' it is recorded in a
narrative history of Elk County I found in the Kansas State Historical
Society library in Topeka.
The scandal with ''Our Jim'' appears to have blunted his political
ambitions. The Moline Republican, with no prizes for guessing its party
affiliations, came up with the allegation that Jim Orr's campaign had
''defrauded'' the county out of the sum of three dollars. Old supporter
the Elk County Citizen fought back on his behalf. ''It is a shame,'' it
thundered in its edition of January 27, 1872, ''that any paper should
stoop for strictly partisan reasons to peddle such a falsehood, and thus
seek to injure the character of one of the brightest and honorable young
men in our county, a young man who is making a record in our state, of
which every citizen of Elk County should be justly proud.''
That would be an appropriate note on which to move west to Colorado.
Quit while you're ahead, and keep out of politics. He married Cora E
Grimes, from Cedar Point, Indiana, and his first law practice was in
Independence. But when the Severy Severyite reports in 1895 that ''Mr
James Orr, our Jim, was in the neighborhood last Sunday shaking hands
with old acquaintances'', it is clear that he was already out of there.
By then he was getting into gold.
Next week: as he concludes his series John Linklater mines a rich seam
in Colorado.

JOHN Sweeney's preposterous hat aside -- it's that or a neon sign
announcing ''Bald Man Crossing'' -- The Spin (BBC2, Wednesday) has
turned out to be one of the better attempts to rake some muck in the
mucky world of the media.
This isn't saying much. It may be saying nothing at all. The
generality of television gazes at its reflection with the self-knowledge
of Dracula checking his mascara in the mirror. But this little show has
been one of those rare, overlooked productions that speaks most clearly
when its jaws are on the hand that feeds.
That Sweeney has yet to encounter the word ''abashed'' helps. In he
ambles, to be hosed down with denials, contempt, and the odd threat of
arrest. It seems only to cheer him up, as though the job wouldn't be
worth getting up for unless he knew he was going to upset someone. This,
of course, is as it should be.
But The Spin is informed by the deeper conviction that, too often, the
media are as much about suppression as expression. Press barons expose
others while claiming the right to privacy; spin-doctors massage
language until meaning disappears; advertising becomes the poke in which
the pig arrives. The truth, to paraphrase our chums at the X Files, may
well be out there -- that doesn't mean it's coming to your
neighbourhood.
Thus the show contained a fun item on a bunch of Canadian subversives
known as the Ad Busters. Their mission is simple: to prove, at every
opportunity, that TV isn't real life and that it exists, in the end,
just to sell you things. Advertising, by this account, is the glove
puppet of business.
The Canucks' efforts to right the wrong by running wholly truthful ads
seemed to miss the point somehow -- propaganda is propaganda -- but it
was refreshing to hear how upset the ''creatives'' (their word) became
when Canada's equivalent of Top Gear was driven off the air by ads
reminding people that cars are wrecking the planet.
Nevertheless, if you say TV isn't real, what have you said? If you
believe advertising addles the brain, what argument does that make for
censorship? To say an advertisement is deceitful won't trouble most of
the audience because they have already worked it out. What's more, they
don't care. TV is an additional world, not an alternative one.
And in that world it's perfectly all right to believe a) that Jimmy
Nail is a giant of his craft; b) that carrying your ego around in a hod
is natural; and c) that the thoughts (never mind songs) of this ''actor,
singer, writer and producer'' are worth even a minute of The South Bank
Show (ITV, Sunday).
It doesn't matter. Nail's views on life, love, and larceny may not be
the greatest intellectual challenge Melvyn Bragg has faced but no-one
was watching Nail. They were watching the Man Who Played Oz, the Man Who
Plays Spender. The curiosity sprang from wondering if he lived up (or
down) to the fiction. So Nail impersonated himself and we impersonated
sentient beings: the chat show formula.
Quite why the South Bank Show should have become a chat show is
another question. Perhaps someone decided that ''personality'' is just
another product to be plugged. Or perhaps Melvyn believes that creating
a saleable persona is just another art to be studied.
In that case, what might he make of Angus Deayton, a funny man at a
loose end being granted, as is now traditional with funny men and loose
ends, his own documentary series? Following the efforts of Clive James
and Clive Anderson, In Search of Happiness (BBC1, Sunday) had less to do
with its subject, broader than Jimmy Nail's accent, than with Deayton.
Like a televisual Crufts, this was intended to show off the best of
breed.
Oddly, for a man not noted for lacking confidence, Deayton seemed ill
at ease, like a stork who has been asked to tap-dance. It was as though
happiness was making him unhappy. In any case, a series such as this
tends inevitably towards whimsy, and whimsy is not Deayton's forte.
Equally, fastidiousness is part of his persona. When confronted with a
couple advertising the joys of trepanning (having a hole drilled in your
head for reasons too nauseating to discuss) his main, queasy
contribution was to ask if he might touch a fruitcake's skull while,
from off in the distance, came the sound of a nation going ''Yech!''.
Happiness was also the subject of Cutting Edge: The Trouble With Money
(Channel 4, Monday). As Will Rogers once put it, money won't make you
happy -- but it helps. The thesis here, with the Lottery again in the
news, was ''Not necessarily''.
This is a statement most accept, yet few really believe. If you are
poor, miserable, or simply fed up with your job, the idea that several
million pounds might actually make you worse off is hard to stomach.
Wealth is the consolation of a secular world; destroy that and you
destroy hope.
Nevertheless, each of us know we wouldn't make the spectacular
mistakes others have made (don't we though?) and part of the voyeuristic
charm of this piece was to allow the unlucky to watch the blessed
screwing up and squandering their one chance so predictably that it made
Greek tragedy seem erratic.
Thus there was Lee Ryan, winner of #6.5m, waiting to be carted off to
jail for the stolen cars he had handled before the big finger pointed
his way. Did Lee understand fate, kismet, the gods who sport with man?
Not in the least -- but he knew down to the last penny how much he had
won. That alone made him eloquent.
But eloquence is hard these days. Ezra Pound once claimed W B Yeats
was the only person he ever met who spoke in perfect sentences. It was,
thought Pound, both impressive and odd.
In that truth might be found the hypnotic energy of Pride and
Prejudice (BBC1, Sunday). Emotions come and go, but syntax endures. No
matter how venal or stupid the characters, each seems possessed of a
mesmerising logic, as though everything that happens has to make sense.
As ought to be obvious, this never happens (and never did) outside
novels. It may nevertheless be one of the reasons why the cast, prone to
a little freelance mugging, are rubbing Miss Austen's prose up the wrong
way.
Equally, the sound of those perfect sentences may be one reason why
you continue to listen when you'd rather not look. An audio-book with
pictures? But think of all the money they spent . . .

WOMEN who take any of the seven combined pills named by the Committee
on Safety of Medicines have been advised to visit their GP before their
current menstrual cycle finishes to discuss whether they should change
their prescription.
Dr Alison Bigrigg, clinical director of Greater Glasgow's Family
Planning and Sexual Health Clinic, said that by lunchtime yesterday the
clinic had received 300 calls since noon on Thursday.
However, there did not appear to be any panic among the women in
Glasgow, she said. Most were simply calling for information.
The clinic in Glasgow's Claremont Terrace will be open today and
Sunday from 9am till 5pm in an effort to cope with the expected
increased demand for consultations and information. Four helpline
numbers have been set up: 0141-211-8142, 8154, 8159, and 8160.
General practitioners are angry that the warning was sprung on them
via the media. In many cases they learned of the committee's advice
through newspapers before letters from the Department of Health had
reached them.
Dr Brian Keighley, chairman of the BMA's Scottish GP committee, said:
''This is the latest in a long line of public relations disasters as far
as GPs are concerned.''
In his practice of 2700 patients in the Balfron, he had already
identified 38 patients who are affected by the guidance issued. For
large practices of GPs, the extra burden would be much more difficult to
cope with. They would have no choice but to absorb the extra work into
their day.
''I am already representing a very demoralised and overworked
profession. This has just been so badly handled, I wonder if someone
from the Department of Health is going to apply to be director of the
Prison Service,'' he said.
''My advice to patients is not to worry and to complete the course
they are on. They should come in over the next couple of days before
their cycle is over and talk about changing,'' said Dr Keighley.
''There are inherent risks in becoming pregnant. Every pregnancy
carries a risk and the risks in pregnancy are at least, if not greater,
than taking an oral contraceptive to avoid becoming pregnant. There is a
great danger that women who are not as aware in general terms about
health might pick up a newspaper, read an alarmist report, and stop
taking the pill. That is the quickest way of becoming pregnant.''

It has been the formula for social change over three decades, but it
has had its side-effects. As yet another health scare hits the pill
Elizabeth Buie looks at how it has changed lives and how it could affect
health.
IT was the contraceptive pill that put the swing into the Swinging
Sixties and led to the permissive Seventies.
It revolutionised sexual behaviour, changing the balance of power in
relationship between men and women.
If women themselves have now begun to fear the pill on the grounds
that it feels unnatural, this is partly because of a growing trend away
from unnecessary hormonal interference in the body's functions and a
groundswell in favour of more natural remedies.
Men in general have also feared the pill, but because it gave women
their freedom. They might claim that it gave them the chance to sate
their sexual appetites without fear of fatherhood, but in truth it was
women's behaviour that was changed. They had finally been given the
opportunity to choose their sexual partners, armed with the means to
control their own fertility.
Now women may say that it is time for men to take responsibility for
contraception and take the male pill once it is fully developed.
The pill was invented by Professor Carl Djerassi, an American research
chemist, in an obscure laboratory in New Mexico on October 15, 1951. It
went through years of tests and became widely available in 1960.
The euphoria that greeted this new-found liberation soon started to
fade, however, as experience and time threw up side-effects of the
combined oral contraceptive pill.
There have been other panics -- notably in 1977 when another warning
about the dangers of thrombosis led to a move from high-dose to low-dose
in the correct belief that they offered a lower risk. Then in 1983,
another pill scare was followed a few months later by a high peak of
unwanted pregnancies and abortions, mainly among women in the 16-29 age
group.
Women have begun to have second thoughts about taking chemical
hormones which affect their monthly cycle as side-effects have emerged
-- headaches, depression and weight gain, and evidence that it increases
the risk of breast cancer, heart problems and thrombosis.
Some woman have also claimed that after years of using the pill, they
found it harder to conceive. By way of response, manufacturers have
increasingly lowered the dosage of drugs.
Family planning experts, though, stress that pregnancy carries twice
as many risks of thrombosis as faced by women who have been taking any
of the seven contraceptive pills implicated on Thursday -- Femodene,
Femodene ED, Minulet, Triadene, Tri-Minulet, Marvelon, and Mercilon.
Often known as the ''new generation pills'', they have all been
developed in the past decade. They are all low-dose combined pills,
which means they contain low levels of oestrogen and progestogen -- a
synthetic form of progesterone. Oestrogen and progestorone are the two
female hormones which govern the menstrual cycle.
The pill works by preventing ovulation from taking place, impeding the
movement of the egg and sperm, and by preventing the lining of the womb
from thickening sufficiently to nourish any embryo.
The new generation pills are only seven out of 26 combined pills,
almost all of which also have low dosages of oestrogen, but these seven
were favoured as it was thought they had fewer side-effects such as
breast tenderness and acne.
Doctors say that we should not lose sight of the fact that the
combined pill is very effective in reducing the risk of ovarian cancer
and reduces the occurrence of anaemia and endometriosis.
Initial pills in the early 1960s had doses of between 100 and 150mgs
of oestrogen, but an increase in venous thrombosis was quickly linked to
it and the level of oestrogen was cut to 50mgs. It was then thought to
carry a ninefold risk of thrombosis.
In the 1970s, the combined pill with 30mgs of oestrogen was found to
be just as effective and to carry only a threefold risk of thrombosis.
But then researchers turned their attention to reducing the level of
progestogen and two new artificial progestogens, desogestrel and
gestodene were developed.
This pill, of which the seven named brands are variations, was thought
to carry fewer side-effects and to suit women better. But it has been
found to carry a six-fold risk of thrombosis.
Around 80 to 90% of women taking the seven brands named by the
Committee for Safety in Medicines are now likely to be advised to switch
to either Microgynon 30 Ovranet, or Loestrin, which were favoured in the
1980s, according to Dr Alison Bigrigg, clinical director of Greater
Glasgow's Family Planning and Sexual Health clinic.
As concern has increased about HIV infection, the condom has become an
increasingly popular method of contraception.
Renewed interest will now be focused on other methods of
contraception:
* The progestogen-only mini-pill which must be taken at the same time
every day -- if the margin of two hours is breached, it becomes much
less effective and is therefore suitable only for very organised women.
* The Norplant implant.
* Coils, including the new mirena coil which releases progestogen into
the uterus.
* The injectible Depoprovera, which contains progestogen only.
Both the new form of coil and the injectible carry only minimal or no
risk of thrombosis, but women using them may suffer from more menstrual
bleeding and slight weight gain.

THE petrol price war will be joined with a vengeance today by two
superstore giants Tesco and Sainsbury's.
The move comes six weeks after Esso fired the opening volleys in the
campaign by launching regional pricewatch experiments in which it
promised to offer some of the lowest prices in Central Scotland and the
North-east of England. It said the experiment could be extended
nationwide if it proved successful.
Tesco, the largest independent petrol retailer in the UK, said it
would cut the cost of unleaded petrol from this morning. The company
said customers would pay a maximum of 49.9p a litre for unleaded petrol
at all its superstores.
Mr Jason Tarry, petrol buyer at Tesco, said: ''You won't find cheaper
petrol anywhere in your local area. If another retailer cuts their price
we will match it and that's a promise to all our customers.''
Sainsbury's has also promised major cuts in the price of unleaded
fuel. The company has pledged to sell unleaded for under 50p a litre at
stores across Britain -- and challenged oil companies to compete.
The company's managing director of petrol, Mr Bob Emmott, said:
''Sainsbury's policy has always been to offer the lowest priced fuel in
every area that it trades in.
''Obviously this will fuel speculation that we are escalating the
petrol price war, but I am sure it will be welcomed by motorists
nationwide.''
Esso has denied that it is trying to start a price war.
Mr Bernie Holloway, general sales manager of Esso, said yesterday:
''While the moves by Sainsbury's and Tesco are interesting they would
seem to be linked to short-term promotions and only relate to unleaded
petrol.
''Our pricewatch initiative in Scotland is part of a long-term
business review and means that wherever you see the pricewatch sign Esso
prices across all of our fuels, not just unleaded, are already among the
lowest.''
Last night the industry was waiting to see whether the likes of Shell,
Texaco, and Safeway will react.
The price war is part of an on-going battle for motorists' money
between superstores and petrol stations. In recent years the superstores
have taken more and more of the petrol market from roadside stations,
increasing their national share from 18% to 20%.
Oil firms have been prompted to complain that superstores fight dirty
by selling petrol at a loss in the hope of enticing customers to shop --
an accusation supermarkets deny.
Executives have warned that motorists will regret being tempted into
superstores if large numbers of roadside stations are forced to close.
They say superstores will never offer the all-round services -- often
available for 24-hours a day -- provided by roadside stations.
The prospect of continuing downward pressure on demand for petrol, as
a result of new taxes and environmental concerns, also has been cited as
a reason for the price cuts.

AN American Indian will visit Scotland this weekend in support of
campaigners against opencast mining developments.
Mr Daniel Zapata, whose people, the Chicanos, are fighting against the
effects of opencast operations on the environment in their Arizona
homelands, will visit several Lanarkshire and Fife communities involved
with the Scottish Opencast Action Group today and tomorrow.
Yesterday, he was in Edinburgh attending a conference held by the
London-based Black Environment Network, set up to voice the concerns of
ethnic minority groups about environmental issues.
His own organisation claims that mining operations in Arizona are
destroying burial sites and other sacred lands as well as depriving
desert area communities of already scarce water supplies.
Mr Robin Frame, vice-convener of the Scottish action group, said
yesterday that he was sure that Mr Zapata would be helped by his members
in his determination to alert the whole world to the ''folly'' of
opencast mining.

IN Glasgow Scottish Opera is in a financial crisis, the Citizens'
Theatre is in a similar position and we do not have a theatre large
enough to accommodate certain musicals, which go to Edinburgh.
All three matters may be resolved if a custom-built theatre or
theatres were built with Lottery funds, catering for all three forms of
entertainment. Then the sale of existing buildings could be reviewed.
There is a site in the city centre, previously occupied by Green's
Playhouse. How suitable it may be is a matter for someone with more
architectural experience than myself.
A composite development would perhaps result in greater use on a
week-by-week basis, and embrace a much wider form of arts production,
which hopefully may prove to be for the benefit of all.
A single approach for whatever Lottery funds are required is more
likely to succeed rather than separate applications for narrower
interests.

MARK Fisher says Scottish playwrights no longer inspire audiences.
Wrong. New plays like Dumbstruck, The Salt Wound, and Bondagers have
drawn capacity audiences.
It's a matter of power and control. When a director commissions a new
play, the playwright gains some creative authority. Some directors find
this a threat, and prefer to commission adaptations, thereby controlling
the writer's parameters. Devising shows is a way of keeping directorial
control.
It's no accident that the longest-surviving touring theatre companies
-- Annexe, Fifth Estate, Clyde Unity, 7:84, Wildcat, etc -- were all
founded by writers. We need writers' theatres (remember that's what
Bridie founded the Citizens' for) -- writers on boards, writers as
directors. To re-energise our theatre, directors need to share some of
their power.

OCCASIONALLY I am tempted to travel to my native Glasgow's Royal
Concert Hall, a splendid building which arouses my envy. My share in the
fifth anniversary celebrations was to tempt a Glaswegian friend to join
me at the Opera Gala, a most enjoyable event.
Enjoyable, that is, but for the pain of reading the #2 programme.
There was an apology for giving the wrong surname to one of the
soloists. Members of both orchestra and chorus will have noticed
misspellings of their names but will have received no apology.
Members of the audience may have noticed missing words and letters.
The concert hall may well be ''grateful for the support recieved (sic)
from Scottish Airports'' but this is both misspelt and obscure: is
''Scottish Airports'' a firm which contributes financially or is the
gratitude for kindness with which musicians are treated at all our
airports?
I was inclined to blame the RSNO -- but the following night I was at
the orchestra's delightful opening concert of the winter season (in
Edinburgh) and the programme produced by the RSNO was, apart from one
computer blip, clear, grammatical, and correct.
Then I remembered the programme of the Carl Davis The Flesh and the
Devil last year, a programme which produced a shudder on every page, and
I realised that the blame must be placed firmly on GRCH.
Do those at the top do no more than glance at a programme? Does no-one
know how to edit intelligently the material submitted (perhaps not
always correctly phrased) to produce a homogeneous publication? Does
no-one know how to proof-read? Audiences deserve better.

THE Government has at last taken some action on Temazepam. It has
accepted the public health issue raised by abuse of the drug but
unfortunately the decisive action expected has not been taken.
In theory the rescheduling of the drug to Schedule 3 and banning of
the Temazepam capsules should have a major effect on the amount of
Temazepam available for abuse. Unfortunately it will not be subject to
handwriting restrictions unlike all other Schedule 3 drugs.
The effect on the rescheduling has merely been to criminalise the drug
without affecting the amount prescribed. Any genuine clinical need can
be addressed in the normal restrictions associated with Schedule 3
drugs.
The only rational reason for not introducing handwriting restrictions
is to cushion the blow to the drug companies -- not, as was claimed, to
reduce the GPs' work. If anything, the opposite is the case.
As the safe custody controls reduce the illicit supplies of Temazepam,
the pressure on general practitioners to prescribe more tablets will
increase.
We also need to look at the wider issue of hypnotic prescribing. Is
insomnia a disease? Studies of insomniacs tend not to vary from normal
so it does not fulfil the definition of disease in being ''an
abnormality of physiological function''.
If it is not a disease then why do we treat it? If it is, then the
treatment is certainly worse than the disease.
The medical profession is expected to deal with much wider issues than
just illness but in some areas we can make matters worse and the
Temazepam tragedy is a clear example of this.
We must learn from our mistakes and rethink our approach to this
condition. If the drug companies suffer from the reduced prescribing of
sleeping tablets, then it is a price worth paying.

Sheep's Fescue, Wavy Hair and Sweet Vernal are all playing their part
in ensuring that ski development does not mean the death of a mountain.
Paul Welsh meets the guardians of the enviroment at Nevis Range
WHEN he went ahead with this project, explains Ian Sykes, he had a
''moral dilemma''. And rightly so Mr Sykes, rightly so. As the linchpin
with the requisite energy and drive to build a fifth Scottish ski area
from scratch, Ian Sykes was always going to be treading a fine line
personally, financially, and environmentally if he followed through his
plan for developing Aonach Mor, a great heap of Munro lying seven miles
north of Fort William.
He did and when Nevis Range finally opened for business in December
1989, to some it appeared as if the ultimate mountain man had done the
dirty on his own doorstep, sending thousands up a hill to wreak havoc on
a pristine ecology, bringing technology and all-mod-cons to the empty
mountains where he had first found solace as a teenage climber.
But times change, the boy was now a businessman, and the potential for
development had been clear to him every winter with great swathes of
snow lying in Aonach Mor's gullies until well after mid-summer, a
veritable skiers' jackpot if only they could lay their mitts on it.
In the mid to late eighties however, planning permission was not
easily obtained for such a venture, with public awareness of
environmental issues increasing and the noisy shout of an informed,
anti-ski lobby to the fore. A system that ensured the mountain's
survival had to be established if Nevis Range was to go ahead.
In conjunction with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Institute
of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE), an American system measuring levels of
Least Acceptable Changes (LACs) was finally agreed upon and the lease of
285 hectares of Scottish hillside was made secure for the time being.
Every year since, the ITE has sent fieldworkers to the mountain to
measure LACs, and judge the impact of the development on Aonach Mor as a
whole. Detailed figures are collected for trampled ground, rates of
defoliation and regrowth, path profiles (height, width, and depth),
litter and erosion, for instance.
As Sykes says: ''If we go outside the LACs and disregard or don't
respond to the ITE's recommendations, they have every right within the
terms of the lease to close the development.''
So at a time when companies are more than happy to pay lip service but
little else to the environmental cause, Nevis Range has been living
under the cosh since birth.
Six years on, however, a third phase of construction this summer is a
clear sign of the development's ongoing ''green'' success with two new
ski-tows nearing completion and due to be officially opened next
Wednesday.
After satisfying more tough environmental conditions, the leased area
has been extended to more than 600 hectares, more than doubling the
total available for skiing, and the number of summer and winter visitors
taking the 2 km gondola ride to 2000ft is steadily creeping towards
250,000. After four years of running at a loss, Nevis Range is now
making a small profit and is a major, year-round tourist attraction in
the North-west Highlands.
''Our environmental position is totally central to the success of this
development,'' says Sykes. ''We could not progress without running along
these lines and we would be very foolish to try to do otherwise. I think
it attracts people because they see we have made a good job of it.'' But
things could have been very different.
Presuming that planning could have been squeezed through with less
stringent controls, the high cost of the eco-friendly approach could
have been waived initially with no need, for instance, for the legendary
helicopter flights which will transport all building materials on to the
mountain. An upsurge in the use of tracked vehicles on the hillside
itself would also make some activities faster and more efficient, but,
inevitably, this damages the delicate soil and vegetation blanketing the
hillside as well.
''Aonach Mor is probably the strictest ski-development in the world in
terms of conservation and a lot of that is self-imposed,'' says Sykes.
''It is an expensive way of doing things but you are left with a very
high quality product at the end of it.''
And the pay-back for Nevis Range is starting to rattle in the coffers.
Similar areas that have inflicted environmental damage in the early
stages of development and have now ''seen the light'', find it very
expensive, if not impossible, to repair their worst excesses. In the
long term, a high initial outlay with ongoing repair work, has proved to
be the cheapest way to reap the rewards of having any sort of
environmental conscience.
Tony Cardwell, senior ranger and environmental officer at Nevis Range,
has been involved in all three stages of construction on Aonach Mor and
works closely with SNH and ITE, rectifying any problems that arise.
''In 1989, there was a very steep learning curve when the first tows
and buildings were constructed, and since then each new area of
development on the hill has presented slightly different conditions
which we have had to adapt to,'' Cardwell said.
From combating erosion in scree and peat bogs to the possibility of
pinning ski-tow towers on to solid rock, the geological and
bio-diversity of this single mountain is obviously not a myth generated
by over-concerned urbanites.
With the short growing season in the sub-arctic Highlands, techniques
for successfully reseeding disturbed areas have grown out of necessity.
Ground is dug as early as possible in the summer, and this allows the
maximum available time for regeneration. Once the concrete base of a
tower has been completed, the hole is backfilled with the original earth
and rubble, and larger pieces of rock are replaced on the surface
moss-side up.
Disturbed areas are then seeded and fertilised as many as four times,
effectively ''force feeding'' the plants to ensure some growth and soil
stabilisation before the frost and snow of late autumn covers them till
spring. Without this, the soil is easily washed away when the snow melts
in the new year.
From an assessment of growth on the hill, SHN and ITE have provided a
seed menu for Nevis Range to follow including grasses like Sheep's
Fescue, Wavy Hair, and Sweet Vernal.
''Some of these are desperately expensive,'' says Cardwell. ''One is
gathered from a small field in Austria where someone goes round in
autumn tapping the stems with a stick to collect the seeds.''
Ironically, the watchful eye of the Nevis Range management has
probably turned Aonach Mor into the best-kept mountain in Britain. In
many cases, it is impossible to distinguish between natural erosion and
development-led erosion and Cardwell watches landslips, peat bogs, and
vegetation in general, with a keen eye.
''In the area of the new tows, we raked out some peat hags that had no
growth on them at all, neutralised the acid in the ground with lime and
seeded them as an experiment in erosion repair,'' he says. ''It is
natural form of erosion but we have to be one step ahead of that, as
well, because it can look bad for the project.''
Overgrazing by sheep sheltering under ski-towers during inclement
spells of weather at 3000ft is also easily misinterpreted. In this case,
however, Cardwell is more muted.
''Malcolm Hunter, the crofter, brings his dogs up and chases them off,
but they are usually back before evening. They are hefted to the hill,
so you would have to take them to Aberdeenshire to stop them coming
back.''
For Sykes, other people's environmental concerns have ultimately been
a positive benefit to Nevis Range but his own personal battle goes on.
The Protector versus Pragmatic Developer of Nevis Range is currently in
round 12 or thereabouts.
''During the impact study for this new ski area, one of the major
planning objections from SNH was that it would affect the habitat of the
golden plover,'' Sykes says. ''I had no idea what that was, so I asked
someone to show me one on the hill but there weren't any there. It was
just the habitat, no inhabitor.''
Obscure arguments aside, Sykes believes people have a right to object
and understands why some people did not want a ski area on the mountain
in the first place. It is the ''unfair and childish complaints'' that
really get him but he remains realistic.
''Although the system of LACs is very cumbersome and difficult to
implement, it brings all the different agencies together and seems to
have been a great success.''
And for everyone, including the elusive golden plover (a bird), that
is a fairy-tale -- one man's moral dilemma resolved, with a happy ending
that keeps on growing.

I READ from time to time criticisms of the NHS. Neither my wife nor I
will ever see 75 again, and according to you should be suffering from
the ''NHS cuts''.
On the contrary our experience of the NHS has been exemplary. Here in
Ayrshire there is an excellent team of attentive and efficient doctors
backed by courteous and helpful receptionists, practice sister, district
nurses, physiotherapists, and chiropodists.
At Ballochmyle, Crosshouse, and Ayr hospitals we have both received
prompt and effective treatment. The doctors and nursing staff could not
do enough for us.
I have no reason to believe that the treatment we have received is any
different from that of the other patients of this practice. We are most
grateful to them all.

WATCHING The Mortal Storm for the umpteenth time, I knew to have the
paper hankies handy as James Stewart and his fiancee began their
perilous flight from the Nazis. The latter included the lady's two
brothers and her ex-fiance, Robert Young, whose platoon fires the fatal
shot which spoils a happy ending. Some films you can watch again and
again and still be moved. All right, this one is heavy in propaganda
rhetoric, but when you look at the date -- 1940 -- you will see that it
was remarkable for its time.
The US was two years away from involvement in the war in Europe and
yet Hollywood made a powerful drama about the way in which a cosy little
Bavarian town and its friendships were ripped apart by the Nazi
revolution in Germany. It captured the way in which bullying and peer
pressure forced many decent Germans into conformity. It also underlined
the fact that awareness of death camps for non-Aryans existed right at
the start of the war.
For all that, films about the Nazis have a kind of cosiness. The
monster has been slain, and is no longer a threat to our freedom. The
battle between good and evil is easily portayed -- the baddies wear
swastika armbands. Occasionally a conflict of loyalty arises, but by and
large the battle lines are clearly drawn.
An ideology, a system, a party, or an Army -- these are the
traditional villains in the field of human conflict.
But what happens when the enemy is not a system or a party or a man in
uniform? Or the enemy is nothing so coherent as an ideology, but a moral
virus which is spreading randomly with no identifiable leader, no core
which can be attacked in order to cure? What happens when the enemy is
freedom itself? Permit me to explain what I mean.
We value and enjoy freedoms today which were unheard of in previous
generations. There are a lot more of us, and yet the material level of
comfort in Europe and North America is pretty high for the vast majority
of the population, something which makes us quite different from our
nineteenth-century forebears. Yet within this demi-paradise dwell demons
of horrific power -- such as crime, drugs, and violence -- which belong
to no uniformed organisation, espouse no ideology except anarchy, and no
god except ego. They produce symptoms of social decay, moral decline,
and godless hedonism and yet they do not admit of any simple cure.
Like bacteria and viruses which learn how to resist the latest
medicines, the demons learn new tricks of survival and new techniques of
destruction. Yesterday's Herald carries a page of special pleading by
the parents of the ''boy from hell'' whose horrendous behavioural
problems have been diagnosed as attention deficit disorder (ADD). The
majority of the article is an attack on the social and legal authorities
who tried to cope with him. For me, it just doesn't ADD up. Anxious that
their son should not be blamed, the parents end up blaming society.
The same might be said of these delinquent pupils whom my colleague
Jack McLean once attempted to teach. All the bleating about lack of
resources for education doesn't address the real issue which he so
pungently identifies as ''degenerate scum'' ruining schools for the
decent kids. What has happened in the past 50 years is that the less
desirable elements in society have learned to use freedom in order to do
as they please. And if that doesn't work, some cock-eyed lawyer will
persuade them that their ''human rights'' have been infringed if they
have been belted at school or lost their job because they became
pregnant.
Typical of the insanity which has taken hold in our society is the
protest which greeted the introduction of surveillance cameras into the
city centre in an attempt to reduce crimes of violence. ''Infringement
of civil liberty!'' screeched those who seem to have greater respect for
the liberty of louts and morons to wander the streets than they do for
the innocent citizen who wants to stand on the street looking for a taxi
without being punched or stabbed.
Those who opposed state socialism with vehemence used to be able to
point to many examples of its follies. In theory socialism is just and
fair but there were too many examples of its tendency to oppress rather
than liberate those who lived under it and it is not surprising that
history has recoiled from its excesses in Germany and Russia. Its
opposite -- which decentralises and gives greater freedom to different
groups in society is equally admirable in theory, but it, too, has a
weakness. It depends upon honourable attitudes among those who use the
system.
If they fleece it, then it will go rotten. We see it happening in
Russia where bribes and gangsterism have been given freedom to flourish.
We see it in the greed of share options for fat cats in privatised
utilities. We see it in those who fleece the system of social security
benefits, a similar form of theft with lesser sums involved, but more
numerous in its occurrence.
The trouble is that they are all in favour of freedom (their own) and
the only villains are those people who prevent them getting what  they
want. It's like the Nazis all over again -- but with the terrible
difference that today's thugs don't wear swastika armbands. If you doubt
how much strength this invisible army has, just look around (but take
care not to use a surveillance camera -- they don't like that).

''FIVE charming sisters on the gayest, merriest manhunt that ever
snared a bewildered bachelor! Girls. Take a lesson from these husband
hunters!'' That is how MGM promoted Pride and Prejudice back in 1940. I
guess the ad was dreamed up by a hack at the studio, although it would
be fun to think that Jane Austen herself came out of retirement, in the
manner of a literary Norma Desmond, and flew in to help with the
publicity.
Amazed, perhaps, by the sight of Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier
(who had recently played Heathcliff) impersonating her beloved Elizabeth
Bennet and Darcy, she kept quiet for a decade or five afterwards.
Perhaps she bought a house in the Hollywood Hills. Now she's back, in
any case, and this time it's MEGA! Girls! Take a lesson from these movie
producers!
You only have to check the schedules at your local cinema. In recent
weeks we have already had Clueless, a modernised spin-off from Emma, and
a period version of the same book is on the way. The BBC is in the
middle of screening its new Pride and Prejudice, hot on the heels of
Persuasion over the Easter holiday weekend, and the director Ang Lee has
a Sense and Sensibility, with Emma Thompson, Imogen Stubbs and -- of
course -- Hugh Grant, in the pipeline. To be frank, Austen mania is
likely to become the most widely publicised media growth industry since
the advent of the Beatles.
It is hard to believe that the current Jane Austen fad will throw up
anything more ridiculous than last Sunday's episode of Pride and
Prejudice (to be shown again this evening) in which Darcy, returning to
Pemberley on business, plunges half-dressed and Byronic into a river
before unexpectedly meeting Elizabeth Bennet. Cue heavy breathing.
How did Jane Austen get so raunchy? At this rate, it won't be too long
before Mary Whitehouse lays into Emma Woodhouse and accuses her of
promoting sexual interest between young people -- hardly more than
children, some of them actually -- without giving sufficient weight to
her own family-building responsibilities. The only thing that could slow
the craze down is the unfortunate fact that it will soon run out of
source material. Then, presumably, it will be the turn of Emily Bronte
to get it in the neck.
The parallel is instructive, and not only because Darcy is always
vying with Heathcliff for the title of Number One Sex Symbol in the
English literary canon. In other ways, too, Heathcliff (and Darcy) can
be regarded in a Byronic light, as being mad, bad, and dangerous to
know. Terry Eagleton, for instance, the Warton Professor of English at
Oxford, has recently published a study entitled Heathcliff and the Great
Hunger in which he inserts Bronte's novel obliquely into current debates
about the Irish Famine.
In the wake of Middlemarch last year, a huge success and now regarded
as having unilaterally breathed life into a moribund genre, the BBC
commissioned its screenwriter Andrew Davies -- who is also resposible
for House of Cards and its follow-ups -- to adapt Pride and Prejudice.
The end result holds few surprises. Davies is a past master at
revamping the classics by introducing hypothetical sex. And so, at the
beginning of the very first episode, as the Bennet sisters visit
Netherfield in a fleeting series of close-ups, we see their faces --
immobile except for the eyes, which follow the red-tunic soldiers with
unconcealed delight.
The story that Andrew Davies tells is still a comedy as Jane Austen
intended, but it is no longer a light comedy. It is still a period
picture, in which women's dresses run from neck to ankle, but now there
is a tartness and a well-trimmed melancholy in the outfits, and for once
you notice how the hems drag up mud on a ramble.
You can understand why TV folk adore her. For those attempting to
dramatise Jane Austen or to play her characters on screen, she can be
embarrassingly generous -- almost up to Dickens level -- with her covert
stage directions. (This could be a clue to her current popularity in
Hollywood too. It's not her small world that appeals; it's the big help
that she offers you in fleshing it out. She's her own script editor,
virtually her own director -- and it's all free.)
The irony is, the kitsch factor in this new Pride and Prejudice refers
to a Dickensian predecessor -- Martin Chuzzlewit, wonderfully rendered
for the screen by the novelist David Lodge -- and, before that, to
Andrew Davies's Middlemarch of course.
His Pride and Prejudice feels closer to David Lean's great Dickens
movies than it does to the sedate chattiness of most Austen adaptations.
It has something of Lean's willingness to skirt the brink of caricature
and stop an inch short, something, too, of his suggestion that in a
society driven by bluster, virtue is most likely to reside in the tacit
and the diligent.
Occasionally the series goes too far. There are times when its
clutching at modern sensibilities makes scant historical sense: if
you're going to show Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy kissing in the street --
a street in Netherfield of all places -- you might as well go the whole
hog and have them perform oral sex in the ballroom at Rosings. Is that
what the novelist had in mind?
Discussions of Jane Austen's sexuality are notable for their rarity,
largely, one suspects, because they have so little to do with the way we
read the novels. The way we read the biography is a different matter
entirely.
It is impossible for the lover of Jane Austen -- and lover is the
operative word here -- to have anything but mixed feelings about
Austen's older sister Cassandra. One the one hand, we owe to Cassandra
the only surviving (if bad) portraits of Austen other than silhouettes.
On the other hand, one can only deplore Cassandra's high-handed actions
after Austen's death: these included burning great quantitites of her
sister's letters and censoring others by snipping pieces out of them.
The vast majority of these letters were written to Cassandra. Though
Austen wrote from time to time to other members of the large Austen clan
-- her three brothers and their wives, various favourite nieces and
nephews -- Cassandra was the person around whom her life revolved, and
she wrote regularly to her whenever they were separated. (Spinsters
both, the two Austen sisters lived together all their adult lives --
first at Steventon and Bath with their parents, then after their
father's death in 1805, with their mother and a female friend at Chawton
in Hampshire.)
Cassandra was ''older and calmer'', wrote James Edward Austen-Leigh,
Austen's nephew, in 1867. The family said that ''Cassandra had the merit
of having her temper always under her command, but that Jen had the
happiness of a temper that never required to be commanded.'' When Sense
and Sensibility was published in 1811, some readers thought Austen had
modelled the characters of the Dashwood sisters -- the sober Elinor and
the sprightly Marianne -- on her sister and herself.
And yet reading through the correspondence in 1995 -- especially in
the light of recent historical findings about the psychic complexity of
female-female relationships in late eighteenth-century and early
nineteenth-century Britain (the recently rediscovered diaries of
Austen's lesbian contemporary, Anne Lister, are an example) -- one is
struck not so much by the letters' triviality as by the passionate
nature of the sibling bond they commemorate.
Reading Austen's letters to Cassandra, now edited in an excellent and
revised Oxford University Press volume, one cannot help but sense the
erotic undertones of the sister-sister bond. The letters from Austen
that Cassandra allowed to survive testify to such a primordial bond.
In her novels, too, women displace men. Virginia Woolf observed of
Austen's fiction that ''it is where the power of the man has to be
conveyed that her novels are always at their weakest''. Admittedly, her
masculine characters are often vivid, and she has a good eye (or ear)
for men's fatuousness. Nevertheless it is usually clear from the outset
that Austen's heroes are inevitably inferior to their sisters.
And so, if men are ultimately insignificant in Jane Austen's novels,
women are, by contrast, a source of unending sisterly preoccupation.
Austen's physical descriptions of women -- their faces, voices, hair,
clothing, comportment at balls and in sitting-rooms -- are funny,
complex, often poignant, and as exquisitely drawn as any of her fiction.
The question of sex is not irrelevant. Indeed Terry Castle, an
American professor of literature, caused a furore in the academic world
last summer by claiming that Jane Austen was gay, or, at any rate, may
have had a lesbian relationship with her sister Cassandra. Much
spluttering ensued.
On behalf of the Jane Austen Society, the eminent critic, Brian
Southam, responded by saying the evidence (mainly in the letters)
provided by Ms Castle was meagre and unconvincing. And yet, whether or
not Austen's fans like this king of argument, it has to be taken
seriously and without recourse to the hysterical counterblasts favoured
by the Janeites as they are sometimes called -- to the effect that Ms
Castle had somehow ''polluted the shrine'' by daring to reflect along
these lines about Austen's emotional life.
Controversy is nothing new in Austen studies which has devoted most of
the past 100 years to a frantic dispute over the novelist's politics.
Some distinguished critics such as Marilyn Butler argue that Austen was
a conservative already nostalgic for the world of her childhood as it
was consigned to the past by the hectic pace of the industrial
revolution.
Others, like Margaret Kirkham, make a case for Jane Austen the
feminist or radical, the advocate of women's rights, whose fictional
treatment of various middle-class imbroglios was simply intended to
highlight the inequality of the sexes, and the way in which women were
forced to regard themselves as objects, or chattels, to be exchanged for
security in a patriarchal world.
Yet Jane Austen's work is fiercely contested on both sides for the
simple reason that both sides agree that it occupies a crucial middle
ground. It comes before and after two celebrated eras in the history of
feminism: the Bloomsbury set, on the one hand, and the Enlightenment
polemic Mary Wollstonecraft on the other.
In recent weeks the feature film, Carrington, has provided an
opportunity for yet another wave of Bloomsbury reassessment in the
press. In the Spectator two weeks ago, Simon Jenkins admired
Bloomsbury's commitment of self-commemoration, but he also pointed out
that, as with George Eliot and Jane Austen, Lytton Strachey and the
others retained their allure for more or less prurient reasons: ''Sex
has proved the Bloomsbury group's one bankable, collective asset,''
Jenkins wrote.
''The reason is not just the overtness of the various couplings and
uncouplings and the continuing fascination with historical
homosexuality. What sets the Bloomsbury experience apart is that no
group of people have been so articulate in recording their feelings.
Their auto-analytical output was astonishing.''
It has become normal practice for novels that have been filmed or
televised to be reissued with stills from the production on the cover --
in this respect, as you can imagine, the Jane Austen wing of the
publishing industry is working overtime at the moment -- but is it now
to happen to biographies, too? Must all future studies of George III
bear the face of Nigel Hawthorne?
In any event, they do these things even better in France. Over there,
the film Carrington has been a great success, and the second part of
Holroyd's Lytton Strachey has been duly issued with a new title:
Carrington. No doubt the presumptions of the film -- that, being
basically homosexual, all Englishmen are hopeless with women -- accord
perfectly with those almost universal in France anyway. Now you see the
appeal of Pride and Prejudice a la Andrew Davies. A bonk at bedtime, as
the Sun famously remarked. Girls! Take a lesson from these husband
hunters! That is how we like our reading matter nowadays.

THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
Aileen Little has a close encounter with erotic artist Jack Vettriano
THE other day I made a date with fate. To be precise, that was the
title of Jack Vettriano's controversial Festival exhibition; but a visit
to the artist's Edinburgh home offers up the same intoxicating mix of
chance, risk and make-believe. Come into my parlour, said the spider to
the fly.
And what a parlour! To Vettriano -- an engineer turned highly
sought-after painter -- life is like his narrative paintings: a bit of a
drama. The plush, scarlet drapes swagged just inside the Georgian
townhouse door hint at rich colour and decadence beyond. ''I got the
idea of the drapes from a Peter Greenaway film -- the drama will now
unfold,'' explained the artist, ushering me past a console table topped
with a red fez.
And unfold the drama did. Sunk into a deep-buttoned settee in the
neo-classical drawing-room I am to submit to an interview myself, before
my own can begin.
So do I have a partner? Oh, but surely it affects our relationship
that the said partner doesn't share my passion for things artistic?
He'll have other qualities though? Hmm? I wondered what was going on,
much in the same way as Vettriano's pictorial subject matter challenges
those who view it. Was he interested in me? Or was the idea to pretend
he could be, in order to inject a certain frisson? I am unable to judge.
Vettriano, who has had work hung at the RA and the RSA, enjoys games.
Above the marble mantelpiece hang two paintings commissioned by a
friend. Each gilt oval frames a shadowy face concealed behind a mask.
''I went to a party once,'' recalls their owner. ''No-one was allowed to
remove his mask before midnight. The essential physical ingredient --
the eyes -- was missing. It was a turn-on.''
Masks feature in the Fife-born artist's own paintings too. They seem
to reinforce the notion that nothing is quite what it seems. The women
in his evocative forties and fifties ''storyboards'' seem as much on the
make as men. They populate a world heavy on shadows and cigarette smoke,
a time when men were men and women thrived on it.
The pundits all have their say -- that Vettriano wants us to question
the suggestiveness of pose and body language; that he is teetering on
the brink of pornography; that, because he is a divorcee, he is
responding to the pain of yearning. He readily admits to being
melancholic. But I asked whether something fundamentally straightforward
is going on as well. Is Vettriano simply painting out his sexual
fantasies? Without a doubt, he replied, he wouldn't do a painting that
didn't mean something to him.
''But take The Perfectionist (back view of a woman in a basque,
astride a chair the wrong way round): that's not a fantasy. Anyone with
money and clout can sit a woman on a chair. I'm just showing a man who
has come through the acceptable range of human activity and now derives
satisfaction from the ritualistic side of things. He wants to light
candles and place the woman just so. Nor am I being unfair to the women
-- thousands of happily married women play games.''
The mention of candles draws attention to the magnificent
free-standing candelabra flanking the windows, one of the artist's
antique-shop finds. Candles are a preferred source of lighting even in
the plum-coloured bathroom. They feature strongly in the
chiaroscuro-style paintings too -- creating a spiritual light. ''As a
painter, one of the great pleasures is when you start to pick out the
light -- a face starts to take shape and the painting begins to look 3D.
You can go back to Caravaggio -- candles are a powerful device to create
atmosphere. They're also frightening. And sexy.''
So to what extent have Vettriano's talents as an interior designer
conspired to create a seduction den? He says house and paintings feed
off one another. He wants a look at once sombre and masculine (''My
thoughts are 90% dark and 10% light''). He works crazy hours and
Saturday night is playtime. But he's giving nothing away. Any more
information, he says, and I'm going to have to trade information for it.
I change tack. We look at the furnishings which appear in his
paintings. Over there, the black dining-room fireplace from the Master
of Ceremonies, one of four paintings bought by Sir Tim Rice. And here,
the desk, minus Bakelite telephone, from A Mutual Understanding. The
Sparrow and the Hawk features his wistful Victorian bust, plus masks and
ubiquitous candles. Vettriano never paints outside his studio, a huge
upstairs room flooded with light; he paints all his backdrops from
memory. ''I like a framework -- fireplaces are so beautifully
balanced.''
Structure and form order daily life too. In his blue bedroom, some 25
pairs of highly-polished shoes line up obediently on the floor
(''there's something about a man who wears a strong pair of shoes'').
Fledgeling collections -- antique spectacles, cigarette cases, walking
canes, leather gauntlets, and a Gladstone bag -- are artfully displayed
here and there. This is a serious, almost ecclesiastical house.
None the less, Vettriano comes across as a nice man. And I say that
despite his penchant for games, despite his heart of darkness and
knowing he can spell trouble. He likes to think fame hasn't changed him
and I believe it. For one thing, few successful artists display the work
of others so generously. A huge Jenny Saville nude graces the staircase;
classical sculpture testifies to his adoration of women; an Alexander
Fraser adorns the dining-room. Vettriano's own work is conspicuously
absent.
No-one wants to come in and feel obliged to say, ''Oh Jack, aren't you
doing well?'' he argues. He's wrong of course. For as long as he
continues to produce his nostalgic, enigmatic canvases, people will want
to look at them and those, like Robbie Coltrane, Alan Coren, Valerie
Singleton et al, who can afford the (sometimes #10,000) price tag will
continue to buy them. After all, like the home he has lovingly created,
the paintings are a stage in which we recognise ourselves as players.

A MAN who raped an 11-year-old girl after his pregnant girlfriend lost
interest in sex was yesterday jailed for seven years.
Lord Dawson told James McDowall: ''You systematically abused and raped
a girl of tender years. No civilised society can tolerate such abhorrent
abuse of children by adults for their own sexual gratification.''
McDowall, 32, of Titchfield Street, Kilmarnock, admitted indecency
offences involving the girl and raping her at a house in Glasgow between
January 1992 and July 1993.
Mr Robert McCormack, solicitor-advocate, told the High Court in
Edinburgh that at the time of the rape McDowall's girlfriend was
expecting.
''She lost interest in sex as a result,'' said Mr McCormack. ''The
period of abuse was at the time of the pregnancy through to the
aftermath of the birth of their child.''
He told the court that McDowall had sex with the girl three times when
she was 11 and 12, each time using a condom.
A year after the abuse ended, the victim told her boyfriend what had
happened.
The allegations caused a split between McDowall and his girlfriend and
the accused finally confessed his guilt in a tearful interview with
police.
Mr McCormack added: ''He sought a reconciliation with his girlfriend
but she wanted nothing more to do with him.''

IN his Conservative conference speech John Major issued a dire warning
that the tax raising powers of a Scottish parliament would cause
employers to flee the country in droves, and severely damage inward
investment. Michael Forsyth has now amplified the warning to an
impending ''jobs holocaust.''
It is beyond dispute that taxes have risen relentlessly in recent
years under Mr Major and his Tory predecessors. Yet I do not recall any
cautionary note being sounded at any time by him, his two Chancellors or
Mr Forsyth that jobs would suffer in consequence. On the contrary,
inward investment has been high, and we are constantly told that Britain
now has the most successful economy in Europe.
What are we to conclude? That Conservative taxes are benign and job
creating, whereas those levied from Edinburgh would be the opposite?
That Scottish taxation raised wholly in the form of VAT, preferably on
thelower paid, would be applauded in Downing Street and St Andrew's
House?
Or that, as usual when pronouncing on the democratic future of
Scotland, Mr Major and Mr Forsyth are talking out of the zips at the
backs of their heads?

<HEADLINE>Future of crofting. Encouraging Forsyth proposals</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>14</PAGE>
<ARTICLETYPE>LEADER</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>975782126</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
POSSIBLY not many people would recognise ''the transfer of power and
responsibility to local communities'' as ''a key plank in the
Government's philosophy,'' as was claimed yesterday by Mr Forsyth, the
Secretary of State for Scotland. This has been a centralising
administration with local government independence being the relentless
victim of its practical policies whatever the theoretical philosophy
behind them. It would, however, be churlish not to welcome a departure
where a more positive theory and practice do seem to coexist. Mr Forsyth
has come up with a good idea for the future of crofting and not just for
the substantial crofting lands still retained by the state, amounting to
109,000 hectares in 95 separate crofting estates. These are being
offered to those who work them as trusts to be modelled on the Assynt
Crofters Trust, a recent creation whose members bought out the superiors
and now manage the lands involved collectively by themselves. By
extension, with the present proposals, the same model is being
recommended to other crofters, and crofting landlords, as an improvement
on the present position, and as such deserving of encouragement. The
history of both crofting and Scottish Conservatism make it possible that
some will regard this whole notion with acute suspicion, but that would
be a mistake: it looks genuine and attractive and would have the
advantage of speeding up and making general a process which would
otherwise go on but be slow and piecemeal in its development.
This is a general endorsement; details like the price to be paid for
the land involved remain unspecified (as do questions of mineral
rights), but it would seem at once that it would not be onerous enough
to prevent the implementation of the scheme if people want it. Land
prices would be bound to vary (though hardly by very much because of the
nature of most crofting lands), but given Mr Forsyth's role in promoting
this initiative, it seems likely that public funds would be made
available to help realise it.
It seems a good guess that many will want to make the effort to do so;
and making capital available for purchase is hardly very different from
local authority mortgages which funded some at least of the council
house sales. A trust which provides for whole crofting communities
overcomes many of the drawbacks which individual ownership of small
agricultural units imposes on their efficient management. It also would
deliver the sense -- and certainty -- of ownership, no matter that it is
joint and not individual, which has escaped most crofters during the
past century.
Mr Forsyth is trying very hard to challenge preconceived ideas of his
own political stance and thought. He has tried talking to the STUC. He
now makes an original contribution to an old subject, and the inevitable
thought is why should he be pioneering in an area where Labour might
have been expected to lead the way. He has stolen a march. This sort of
initiative is bound to make for a more interesting political life, for
he is not proving to be quite as predictable as his opponents imagined.
He might turn his attention to the ban the Government has imposed on
local authorities using any of the money they have derived from council
house sales, a particularly damaging prohibition in rural areas. A good
case could be made for releasing some of it for new building. As for
devolution, it is no longer unthinkable that the Government could
moderate its present hostility when a central plank in its philosophy
is, apparently, ''the transfer of power and responsibility to local
communities.''

SALVAGE teams were yesterday assessing whether to recover a damaged
trawler which struck rocks in heavy seas on the shores of the Pentland
Firth.
The Burghead-based skipper, Neil Sutherland, 29, and his crew of five
were snatched off the stricken vessel by helicopter as seas swept the
deck and hull in a blustery Force Five.
There were fears that the 85ft trawler was going to break up. She had
keeled right on to her side and was being pounded by the heavy swell.
The Solan ran aground shortly after leaving Scrabster harbour, her
usual fishing base, on Thursday night.
Thurso lifeboat, under coxswain Billy Farquar, had attempted to get
alongside the Inverness-registered Solan, but the breaking waves coming
in from the Atlantic made that impossible. Helicopter winchmen had to
make repeated attempts before the crew were plucked to safety.

IT is unnecessary for James Scott to emphasise the frailty of the
Nationalists at Westminster (October 12). Their handful of MPs has
always been of little significance.
What is puzzling is the continued support for devolution from the
Labour Party, especially since the STUC is insisting on a much larger
and more expensive Scottish parliament in Edinburgh.
One can appreciate that after the 1992 election debacle it has been
tempting to indulge in some half-hearted flirtation with the
Nationalists and the Liberal Democrats.
But now, with the advent of the hard-headed Tony Blair and the
evidence of the polls indicating an overwhelming victory at the polls in
18 months, devolution seems to be a somewhat bizarre obsession with
Labour.
It is sadly a measure which in the long term may cause them regret.

YOUR readers must be wondering, as I do, why The Herald's
preoccupation with keeping me off the Shadow Cabinet has now become an
obsession.
Geoffrey Parkhouse's article poses more questions than it answers
(October 20). Why for example did he find it necessary to mention my
religion but not that of any one of my 41 colleagues who also stood for
election.
Why can he not accept that the Parliamentary Labour Party, in a secret
ballot, was simply not convinced that a handful of colleagues whose
candidatures were frequently promoted by the media, not least The
Herald, are quite ready this time for the portfolios he would dearly
love to confer on them?
Does he not realise that his imperious style is of no help whatever to
those whose political careers The Herald seems determined to advance?
More seriously, I challenge Mr Parkhouse to produce a shred of
evidence that I sent any MP three cards in one week or even in one year.
I also challenge him to advance a single ounce of support for his
suggestion that I asked any MP to vote for ''the disabled''. But I can
tell him now that he will look in vain!
Surely Herald readers are entitled to better than this from a
once-distinguished lobby correspondent?
Tom Clarke, MP,

IN response to M Allen's letter (October 16) on TV licences I would
like to clarify the conditions regarding owners of second homes.
Legally if someone installs or uses a television at two separate
addresses a separate licence is required for each address.
However, it is appreciated that some owners of second homes will never
use a television at their main and second address at the same time.
Therefore a concession exists whereby owners of second homes, who fulfil
certain conditions, only have to purchase one TV licence for both
addresses.
These conditions are: televisions are never in use at the same time at
both addresses; and the second home is only used by the owner and those
people who live with him/her at the main address; ie, if rented out to
tourists or friends you must have a second licence.
The concession is intended to benefit owners who seek to obtain
maximum enjoyment from holiday-home ownership by sharing use of their
second address among the family who reside at the main address.
If anyone requires any more information on this subject they should
contact: 0117 984 0502.

A CONVICTED terrorist seriously ill with skin cancer is being held in
a cell without heating in a top security jail, a High Court judge heard
yesterday.
The ''desperate situation'' was revealed when Patrick Kelly, 44, who
is engaged with other IRA prisoners in a ''dirty protest'', was given
leave to seek a judicial review of the regime at Whitemoor Jail,
Cambridgeshire.
Kelly, serving a 25-year sentence imposed in 1993 for conspiracy to
cause an explosion and attempted murder of a police officer, is seeking
a transfer to a prison in Northern Ireland.
His case has caused the Irish Government concern, and visiting Irish
politicians have expressed fears about the possible negative impact on
the Northern Ireland peace process of the security clampdown in prisons
ordered by Home Secretary Michael Howard after the attempted IRA
breakout from Whitemoor in September last year.
Mr Justice Collins yesterday gave Kelly permission to challenge as a
matter of urgency the legality of the new security arrangements, which
apply to exceptionally high-risk category A prisoners held in special
secure units.
This latest challenge follows a recent High Court ruling that cleared
Mr Howard of unlawfully denying IRA prisoners the right to proper
contact with their families and lawyers through the introduction of
''closed visits'' preventing physical contact with visitors.
Yesterday, Mr Tim Owen, counsel for Kelly, told the court: ''It is a
desperate situation, medically and psychiatrically.''
At present, Kelly is receiving no family visits and is in a cell
without heating after undergoing a major operation. All reading material
has been taken from him.
Mr Kenneth Parker, QC, for the Home Office, said immediately that the
situation would be looked into.
He said new material concerning Kelly's medical condition was due to
be considered by Ministers and a ''fresh decision'' on his case would be
made shortly.

CHARLES RENNIE MACKINTOSH: Art is the Flower
Pamela Robertson
Pavilion, #14.99
THIS book is a joy: not too long; beautifully illustrated, a good read
and a must for anyone who likes Mackintosh and flowers. I do find the
overdesigned typography annoying -- who needs three little black squares
punctuating every paragraph? -- but then nothing's perfect.
The author, Pamela Robertson, has worked on the Mackintosh archive at
Glasgow University's Hunterian Gallery since 1977 so is something of an
authority, but she manages a light touch, avoiding the academic trap as
she whisks us into Glasgow School of Art and beyond. Indeed her
fascinating insights into the art school at the turn of the last century
are especially appropriate during its 150th birthday year.
The elegant line was always paramount for Mackintosh. His drawing
talent was precious, even at Allan Glen's, where he studied for two
years after the general leaving age of 14. As an articled apprentice
architect to Hutchison, then Honeyman &amp; Keppie, he spent 10 years as a
draughtsman, copying and working up other people's designs. In the
evening he attended Glasgow School of Art, studying maths, mechanics,
building construction, geometry, perspective, modelling, drawing and
ornament. This formal training left little opportunity for creative or
artistic expression, for the emphasis was on mechanical precision.
However, he soon won every prize in sight, even capturing a Gold Medal
and Queen's Prize in national competitions, plus free studentships and
first-class certificates at GSA.
Drawing flowers was to become a lifelong habit, although he never
exhibited them professionally till the end of his life. He loved
sketching expeditions, filling page after page of architectural drawings
sometimes interspersed with exquisite studies of plants: daffodils,
roses, primroses, foxgloves and candytuft from the Ayrshire coast.
Several new Mackintosh sketchbooks have recently come to light: three
from the 1890s in Dublin's National Library (which got there via his
friend and stained-glass artist Oscar Paterson's children's Irish music
teacher!) and another found in GSA in, says Robertson, ''an
undistinguished brown envelope.'' This contained drawings from weekend
visits in the 1880s to Keppie's home in Prestwick and jaunts to Bute.
His skills were honed -- and developed by a trip to Italy in 1891 --
but the revolutionary change was to be galvanised by two sisters.
Between 1893-96 a group of young women students at GSA including
Katherine Cameron and Jessie Keppie produced a magazine which later
featured Fra Newbery, D Y Cameron, Annan the photographer and then
sisters Frances and Margaret Macdonald whom Mackintosh married in 1900.
The sister had a preoccupation with symbolism and an innovative
stylisation of plant forms which far surpassed his more traditional
approach. Through them he took a leap to more adventurous, often
asymmetrical, design and greater freedom of expression.
The book is beautifully illustrated with memorable reproductions in
glowing colour of his watercolours of this period plus his later
much-loved botanical studies from 1900-15.
Here again Margaret played a part. In 1901 they went to Holy Island,
the first of several visits which allowed leisure to paint. Mackintosh
began using watercolour on his pencil drawings of Stork's Bill, Cuckoo
Flower, Japonica and Spurge. He also began his famous -- and useful --
habit of including a cartouche (derived from Japanese prints) with date,
place and the initials of those with him at the time of the drawing. In
Stork's Bill MTFBC stand for Margaret, Toshie (Mackintosh himself),
Frances and Bertie McNair, and Charles Macdonald, his brother-in-law.
In 1914, increasingly depressed and dependant on alcohol, his
architectural partnership dissolved, they retreated to Walberswick on
the Suffolk coast, an ideal rural escape whose beauties had attracted
artists since the early nineteenth century.
Here he did more than 40 flower drawings in 12 months, with a view to
an exhibition on the Continent. Most were drawn from freshly picked
specimens or outdoors. He was also known to have worked from pressed
flowers. Most of the flowers are cultivated not wild: herbaceous
perennials, or flowering shrubs -- petunias, anemone, fritillarias,
jasmine. Stylistically Mackintosh's botanical studies relate to aspects
of Japanese painting, their simplicity and reticence achieving a refined
and decorative effect.
The war resulted in a move to London where Mackintosh developed
ambitious, vivid, bold and quite daringly avant-garde flower
compositions which also inspired his textile designs. Robertson
explains: ''These sophisticated, unconventional still-life compositions
did not easily fall within the recognised canons of flower painting of
the day.''
Tragically Mackintosh did not succeed as a professional painter and
his Faded Roses of 1905, so different from the joyous blooms which adorn
his furniture, seem to become a metaphore for loss of hope.
Mackintosh died in 1928 and not till his memorial exhibition in 1933,
on the death of his wife Margaret, were his flower pictures exhibited.
Almost all were sold.
Robertson has made just one mistake. She ignores the vital
contribution of Andrew McLaren Young and his seminal Mackintosh
exhibition of 1968, inferring that Mackintosh did not resurface as a
painter till the ''revelatory shows of the late 1970s at the
Hunterian''. In fact without McLaren Young, who died suddenly and
tragically, I sometimes wonder if we would have heard of Mackintosh at
all.
Robertson has organised a truely lovely exhibition of more than 50
original Mackintosh botanical pictures at the Hunterian until November
4. Make sure to see it -- and marvel.

While John Macleod is optimistic over Michael Forsyth's plans to make
public land available to crofters, he highlights some unanswered
questions
I AM thinking of a beautiful spot on Raasay called Fearns. High,
rolling, fertile ground on the island's south-east corner, it commands
spectacular views over the Inner Sound to Kyle, Kintail, Wester Ross,
southern Skye.
The white cottages of Fearns were built by crofters settled there
after the First World War, who did brief time in prison for seizing it
in a spectacular land raid. Such high jinks eventually persuaded the
Government to buy large chunks of Highland estate and divide them into
plots for new crofting communities. So Fearns, cleared by one of
Raasay's many nasty landlords in the nineteenth century, lived again.
I thought of Fearns when I learned that the Scottish Secretary now
plans to offer up all his crofting estate -- 109,000 hectares of it --
for the use of community trusts, on the lines of the at present
prosperous Assynt experiment. Michael Forsyth's latest Big Idea is a
cheeky initiative calculated to appeal to Highlanders and appal the
Labour Party. It's original. It's devolutionist. And it's already had
Brian Wilson foaming at the mouth.
There are precedents. The Assynt Crofters' Trust is the best known,
established in 1992 after a brilliant campaign by astute residents,
bank-rolled by a nationwide whip round. They levered the purchase by
clever use of the 1976 Crofters' Act, which gave the crofter a statutory
right to buy his holding outright. This the Assynt crofters threatened
to do, in unison, if their bid to purchase the estate was not
successful. That last-ditch option would not have given them common
grazing land, nor sports and mineral rights; but it served to frighten
off rival purchasers. Their bid was successful.
Three years on, things are going well at Assynt. But there is an older
model. In the early twenties, when Lord Leverhulme abandoned his
ambitious schemes for Lewis, he generously donated his Stornoway estates
-- the town itself, the Eye Peninsula, the Broad Bay lands -- to the
people of the district. The Stornoway Trust -- its members are publicly
elected -- has worked well for 70 years and is a source of much local
pride.
The ills of landlords are infamous. They still hold sporting rights --
and, in their pursuit, can make themselves obnoxious. They also hold all
mineral rights -- as my neighbours found, in March 1994, when the factor
wrote to tell them their best common grazing would, in a year or five,
be blown to bits for a quarry, and their compensation would be about a
tenner each.
And there's sheer obstruction. As a young landlord of Sleat, Iain
Noble was able to delay a new road for months in the seventies until he
had won an assurance that the signs would be in Gaelic as well as
English. Zeal for Gaelic is commendable. But the way it was done was
wicked.
More recently, work on the new Harris-Scalpay bridge was held up by a
tussle over the landlord's compensation for rock extraction. Recent
upgrading to a very dangerous part of the Tarbert-Stornoway road was
held off for years; the estate involved bewailing alleged damage to the
brown trout fishing.
Hang on a mo, though. Forsyth has not made clear whether these lands
are to be given to community trusts -- in cases where credible bodies
arise with commanding local support -- or, rather, if the lands are to
be put on the open market, with the community trusts perhaps offered a
first option, or perhaps left to fight in the market-place with everyone
else. Nor is it clear if these trusts will gain not just the land, but
sports and mineral rights.
And what of the considerable tracts of the Highlands held by the
state, not through the Scottish Office but by the Ministry of Defence?
What of the seabed, on which at present the hard-pressed fish-farming
concerns have to pay rent to the Crown Estates -- an insupportable tax
on one of our few viable industries? What, most of all, of the private
landlords? Forsyth offers no threat to them.
Scarp, an offshore island to the west of Harris, was inhabited until
1972, and its crofts are still worked by men of Scarp extraction. The
island was recently put on the market, a trophy (ironically) of the BCCI
disaster; its Asian landlord, a director of that institution, had gone
bankrupt. Did he ever visit Scarp? He announced, 12 years ago, ludicrous
plans for an international leisure resort, which could never have been
built on crofted land.
This year, a Scarp crofter tried to persuade his brethren to make a
collective bid for Scarp. He failed to carry them. The island is in new
private hands. A solemn reminder that, however genuine Mr Forsyth's
offer is, many may not have the vision to take advantage of it.
The sale of public assets in the crofting counties can be dangerous.
In the early sixties the Scottish Office sold -- ludicrously cheap --
its prime assets on Raasay to a Dr John Green. He acquired, for a few
thousands, the Raasay mansion house -- filled with priceless furnishings
and antiques -- the Raasay home farm, the local dairy, the little
harbour, and other good houses and bits of estate.
Green never saw Raasay. Raasay House was looted and ruined. A homeless
couple, bidding for one of his cottages, were refused. An essential
car-ferry link was delayed for years because ''Dr No'' refused to sell a
quarter-acre of land for a terminal. (It was eventually built farther
south, in a most exposed and unsuitable spot.)
Dr Green, mercifully, fell senile; by the time he had died, his
executors had sold his Raasay assets -- at a huge profit -- back to the
state, in the form of the HIDB. All demands for an inquiry into this
fiasco -- how on earth could such a man have bought, and wasted, public
assets? -- were refused.
And what of Fearns? The white houses still enjoy the view. But there
are no crofters here now. For want of a road, the families gave up 40
years ago, and retired to Raasay's main village. Fearns, its croft and
houses, belong to a little holiday-home holy huddle of rich English.
They seldom visit. On the unloved land bracken grows waist high, thick
and toxic, hissing in the soft west wind.

THE Tories say a Scottish parliament will cost the average household
#6 per week: they also claim that people in England will suddenly resent
the sum of money that a Scottish parliament has to spend.
This makes two false assumptions. First that a devolved Scottish
parliament will automatically raise income tax by the full 3p. Secondly,
that Scotland does not already pay its way.
Obviously he first assumption is unjustified, indeed it's a bit rich
coming from a Government that has just raised taxes by an amount
equivalent to nearly 10p in the #1 for an average family.
But the rationale that Scotland does not pay its way is damaged by the
Government's recent publication of state revenues and expenditure in
Scotland. According to this survey, Scotland, including its share of oil
revenues and privatisation proceeds, is only marginally worse off than
the UK in budget terms.
If one follows a more empirical procedure to determine Scottish income
tax receipts and total Government expenditure, as the SNP has done
(taking account of all tax relief and the distribution of non-identified
expenditure) then it becomes apparent that Scotland subsidises the UK.
Perhaps we Scots should be resentful that while Government revenues
per capita are considerably higher from Scotland than they are from the
rest of the UK, we still don't get the Government we elect.

MY LAST GOOD HOLIDAY
* EILEEN McCALLUM -- actress
MY daughter and her family have moved to Kenya so we went out there
last year. Nothing had really prepared me for the country, it was such
an amazing place. The scenery is so beautiful that it literally took my
breath away. You just can't imagine the size of the Rift Valley that
goes right up the middle of Africa is. There are certain memories I have
of the red soil and the masses of people walking along the roads on a
Sunday going to visit family and friends. There were also little
minibuses packed to the gunnels and one bike with three or four people
hanging on to it. At the same time the country has been independent for
30 years now and society is far from perfect. It seems to be a different
kind of segregation now, rather than black and white it's now money.
Things don't seem to have evolved slowly there -- you have things like
the Hilton Hotel right next to grinding poverty.

SURELY the whole concept of independent regions in Britain is
fundamentally flawed when the following two conflicting conditions come
together: first, that the central government in power is of a different
political persuasion from the regional government and, secondly, when
the same region's finances are substantially subsidised by central
government.
A good example of this conflict of interests is the Scottish region
which currently receives annual subsidies of around #5000m from central
government. You then get the ludicrous situation where a Tory central
government sends up billions of extra money to a left-wing dominated
Scottish parliament for it to try out its socialist ideas.
Because of this conflict of political ideals, the anti-Tory Scottish
parliament, even when the faults are its own, will try to lay the blame
on Tory central government, saying that if only it had sent up even more
subsidy money, or if it had not stopped the regional government raising
local taxes, then things would have been so much better.
A Scottish parliament will simply be a mark II Strathclyde region, but
twice the size, and of course reinforced by the left-wing Nats.
The truth of the matter is that the advocates of a Scottish parliament
want to ''have their cake and eat it'', ie, English money and a Scottish
parliament.

THE official ceremonies celebrating the UN's fiftieth birthday in New
York on Monday will provide an opportunity for some high-level
Anglo-Argentinian diplomacy. The Prime Minister will have personal talks
with President Menem. There may be little new that will come from such
discussions but they are bound to be useful in helping return relations
between the two countries to a more normal basis after the Falklands war
of 1982. In fact there has been a steady improvement in relations with
formal visits to Argentina by both the Foreign Secretary (then Mr Hurd)
and the Duke of York in the past two years. More recently the two states
have established the Anglo-Argentinian Hydro-carbons Commission to
facilitate exploration for oil and natural gas in the continental shelf
between the Falklands and the Argentinian mainland. The vital step in
this regard was the deal agreed at the end of September whereby the
whole debate about the Islands' sovereignty was suspended in order to
allow exploration, and later development, to proceed in a peaceful
context. The international oil industry will not finance the very costly
exploration programme involved so long as political instability persists
in the South Atlantic.
The deal is entirely pragmatic: the Argentinians have conceded nothing
in theory. Indeed President Menem sought to project the deal as an
improvement in Argentina's claim to outright possession of the Islands
since collaboration amounted to a British concession. In fact it merely
recognises the realities of geography and the way in which the
International Commission on the Seabed provides for exploration in what
are admittedly shared waters. The British Government takes a benign view
of any Argentinian assumption of concession -- such claims are necessary
for President Menem's domestic electorate, and have no other
significance. There is certainly a huge gap between the present position
and the one which prevailed before 1982 whereby the Foreign Office
managed to convey to Argentinian diplomats the impression that Britain's
grip on the Falklands was relaxing. That was not the case -- as votes in
the House of Commons should have made clear. Both sides therefore stand
firmly by their known positions now, but these are not being allowed to
impede co-operation in other fields (and not just oil exploration, for
Anglo-Argentinian trade generally has grown by leaps and bound since
1990).
It remains to be seen just how important any discoveries turn out to
be; but some observers already predict a new oil province every bit as
rich as that in the North and Norwegian Seas, and their North Atlantic
extensions in the deeper waters west of the Shetlands. If even part of
that hope is realised, there is every chance that the Falklands' economy
will be transformed and that the financial burden the Islands now impose
on the British Treasury will disappear. Such a prospect has its appeal
to the Argentinians, too, for though its effect in one respect may be to
take the Islands even further from their grasp, they too will be
financial beneficiaries on a significant scale. That may not reconcile
them to continued British rule in the South Atlantic (where it is not
only the Falkland Islands they covet) for they may easily consider that
all the gains, and not just a proportion, even if half, should be
theirs. Yet so long as British opinion remains intent on retaining what
looks like being an ever more valuable possession, it seems unlikely
that a future Argentinian administration will try another show of arms,
especially when the first victim of another war would be the
installations garnering the mineral wealth won during the years of
peace.

MOST people would share the view in your series, Visions of Glasgow,
that the extent of waste and blighted land damages Glasgow's image and
deters investors.
How ironic that only a few weeks before the series started Glasgow
District Council lodged a planning application with East Kilbride
District Council to create a huge new rubbish tip on Cathkin Braes.
The scale of the proposal is such that, if approved, it will devastate
the green belt between this part of Glasgow and East Kilbride.
It will also compromise the benefits to be gained from the adjacent
heritage park and loch project now being completed at Stewartfield, and
the prospective Cathkin Braes Country Park, outline proposals for which
were only recently unveiled by the same authority which now wishes to
dump enormous quantities of refuse nearby.
If a local authority is prepared to use fragile and irreplaceable
green belt as a rubbish tip, then any vision of the city's environmental
future, and all that it implies, must be shrouded in doubt.

Chairman, Burnside
Community Council,

<HEADLINE>Son gives his theory on the death of Maxwell</HEADLINE>

ROBERT Maxwell probably fell to his death from his yacht after going
on deck to urinate over the side, his youngest son said yesterday.
Kevin Maxwell told an Old Bailey jury that his father was a light
sleeper and would often wake up in the night. ''He found it more
convenient, as a lot of men do on a boat, to relieve themselves over the
side as it was moving.''
He said the spot his father chose to urinate from was not guarded by a
handrail and only had two thin pieces of wire across it. ''It was not
the safest part of the vessel.''
Kevin Maxwell said that when he heard his father was lost overboard he
considered it might have been an accident, even murder, but he never
believed his father had committed suicide.
The court has heard that the public perception ''that it was suicide
by a man who knew the game was up'' caused a disastrous plunge in the
share price of Maxwell's publishing empire.
In a halting voice, his son described court his emotions when he heard
his father was missing at sea.
''It was a terrible feeling. I can't really explain it. It was the
shock of thinking that he had fallen off the boat,'' he said.
''I was breathless. It was extremely hard to do anything and I recall
the physical shock of the news. It was a terrible blow.
''It's a very difficult thing to explain to people, even with the
passage of years . . . it was the physical loss and the fact he hadn't
been found. It was a terrible burden.''
But even in his grief he realised after a few minutes that someone
would ''have to stay and mind the shop'' because of the business
implications of his father's disappearance.
He and his brother Ian decided to stay in London and send their mother
to the yacht to supervise the air-and-sea search for her husband.
Pausing occasionally, he went on: ''It is very hard to explain the
sense of panic.
''I am normally . . . I consider myself to be quite a calm and solid
individual, and I found myself almost unable to control myself
physically, and I realised that if I didn't get a grip that I would
probably suffer some kind of breakdown.
''I literally pulled myself together on my own in that 20 minutes and
realised that despite not knowing where my father was, that a hell of a
lot depended on not losing control and I therefore sat down and thought
as logically as I could what had to be done.''
He prepared a list of the ''very urgent'' steps to be taken.
They included suspending the shares to prevent a ''disorderly''
market. It took him some 45 minutes to convince the Stock Exchange to
suspend the share price. Such a move, based on the disappearance of a
company head, was not in their ''usual experience''.
From then on he worked from early in the morning until late at night
with little sleep, having meetings with bankers, accountants, and
businessmen. It was difficult to describe ''the intensity of the
meetings and the phone calls and the amount of paper that was generated
. . . and the confusion''.
In addition, he had to fly to New York to reassure the staff of the
New York Daily News who had reacted to the news of his father's death
with ''shock and horror''.
Mr Maxwell, 36, was giving his fifth day of evidence in the trial in
which he, his brother Ian, 39, and former Maxwell adviser Larry
Trachtenberg, 42, are charged with conspiracy to defraud pension funds
by misusing #22m worth of shares to prop up the Maxwell empire in the
days following its founder's death.
All three deny the charges.
The trial continues.

MR Michael Forsyth yesterday promised that the flow of cash for the
Gaelic language would never run dry while he was in the Scottish Office.
The Scottish Secretary said that the Government's decision to pump
millions of pounds into the language was a gamble that had paid off.
As he visited the Royal National Mod in Golspie, Mr Forsyth stopped to
take part in a Gaelic puppet show and joined in a song.
Later, Mr Peadar Morgan, who runs the CLI language group, gave a
Gaelic karaoke videotape to Mr Forsyth, who opened the Skye Bridge on
Monday, pointing out that he might like one of the songs -- Don't Pay
the Ferryman.
''Good advice,'' fired back Mr Forsyth, ''the bridge man is cheaper.''
Mr Forsyth said: ''It is true that we have done an enormous amount for
Gaelic and to regenerate the Highlands, however it is also true that we
do not have one parliamentary seat in the Highlands.''
He said spending for Gaelic had risen from #60,000 in 1979 to more
than #11.3m this year.
It emerged yesterday that the vice-president of An Comunn, Mr Neil
Brownlie, had walked out of the Mod before it had even begun.
Yesterday, as his colleagues coped with the strain of running the Mod
and dealing with a ministerial visit, the 74-year-old writer was picking
tatties on a neighbour's farm at Larbert.
An Comunn's president, Mrs Ann Draper, 73, said she was totally
mystified over the reason for Mr Brownlie's sudden disappearance on the
eve of the Mod.
She said: ''I saw him on Thursday and he was fine. The first I knew
was when I got back to the hotel that night and he was gone.''
Mr Brownlie said: ''The reasons why I left are private and personal. I
have not resigned, but what I will do in the future is a different
matter.''

Defence Correspondent Ian Bruce explains how, despite being rocked by
scandal, Nato can become the world's most effective peacemaker
NATO was formed in 1949 to keep the Russians out, the Germans down and
the Americans in. Europe needed a defensive bulwark and the Soviets an
excuse for shoring up their crumbling economy. On balance, tanks were a
better bet than butter for the protection of the political status quo.
Nobody went to war on a serious scale. There was no nuclear holocaust.
Millions of defence industry workers picked up paychecks on both sides
of the Iron Curtain while the power blocs worked off their tensions in
remote-control brushfire conflict around the periphery.
Ironically, on the eve of finding a new and definitive role in world
affairs as the guarantor of peace in Bosnia, the organisation has now
been rocked by a scandal involving its civilian chief, Willy Claes, and
brought to crisis point by cash rather than conflict.
Nato was, and remains, an alliance based on bluff and founded on
mutual mistrust. It would never have been able to withstand an all-out
Soviet assault without resorting to first use of nuclear weapons. But it
was good PR. Moscow represented the bad guys. There was a focus for
military preparation and a basis for an artificial world economy.
It was always dominated by the United States, the largest, most
powerful member. After all, Uncle Sam had committed more than 350,000
American boys to defend Washington on the Elbe. The US had had plenty of
practice of fighting its wars on somebody else's turf.
When the Wall came down six years ago, the alliance was left with
something of a crisis of conscience. Its very existence was predicated
on the existence of an external threat. An impoverished, shattered
Russia just did not fit that image.
There is a theory that the entire American Star Wars programme was the
most potent weapon ever devised. It destroyed the Soviet Union without
recourse to combat. Moscow bankrupted itself trying to match space-based
missile defence systems which did not exist.
If true, it was a policy which removed the immediate threat of nuclear
war while multiplying conventional instability. The collapse of
communism created an arc of insecurity running from the Adriatic shores
of Yugoslavia to the Spratly Islands of the Pacific. Regional conflict
replaced superpower confrontation. War became ethnic rather than
ethical.
Claes passing leaves a gap which must be filled quickly and
effectively. He was an efficient administrator, whatever else he may or
may not have done. It is a function which will be vital in coming
months.
The man who fills the post must be strong-willed, determined,
diplomatic and focused. The UN has handed on the baton of peacemaker to
Nato. The alliance has to be capable of picking it up and running with
it if there is to be any semblance of peace in Europe.
The wider issue is future membership. Former Warsaw Pact allies still
view Russia, their erstwhile protector and master, as a threat. Even a
penniless Kremlin still has access to a formidable military machine.
Chechnya is a prime example of the possibilities of incurring its
displeasure.
Nato has the potential to become the sword-arm of the UN. Its remit on
a wider world stage would have to be the subject of new alliance
agreement. If that happened, Germany could at last take its place close
to centre stage as a contributor of peacekeeping forces in Asia and
Africa, playing a crucial role which would avoid rousing Second World
War vintage antagonisms closer to home.
Bosnia is the immediate problem. Without Nato intervention on a grand
scale, the three-side ethnic bloodbath will rage on. But Nato without a
strong politician at the helm is no more than a collection of hi-tech
bayonets. Direction must always be political rather than military.
Final, workable solutions are achieved across a table rather than a
battlefield.
Nato's next step, the embracing of former enemies in a pan-European
defensive alliance, also requires strong leadership. The Russians will
always be paranoid. Invasion by the French, the Germans, Turks and
Swedes have left them with an ingrained paranoia over the centuries.
But if smouldering regional and ethnic differences are to be
contained, then Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics and the
Baltic States must be drawn into the fold over the next decade. Moscow
will have to be placated and finally invited to join.
What a new Secretary General must achieve as a priority is the ability
to project the benefits of such an arrangement while not making it look
like a threat to Mother Russia.
The perfect candidate for the mammoth task ahead would, preferably be
from one of the non-hardline member countries. Denmark's witty and
respected former foreign minister Uffe Ellemen-Jensen might be the ideal
choice. Nato is at a crucial crossroads in its history. It has found a
new raison d'etre. Handled properly, it could replace the UN entirely as
the world's most effective peacemaker and keeper.

BIRDWATCH
* FOR a thousand years the blackcap has been one of our favourite
summer singers. In 998 an Anglo-Saxon abbot referred to it as the
''swertling'', an onomatopoeic rendition rendition of its mellow, sweet
song. Though it has been called the mock nightingale and here in
Scotland, as we are deprived of the real thing, the northern
nightingale, its song sounds more like a rapid blackbird. You can hear
it falling from big beeches and oaks in the lowlands, particularly East
Lothian and Dumfries, but it is spreading northwards all the time.
The reason for this is only just being unravelled and is
extraordinary. Blackcaps migrate. Some cross the Sahara; some stay in
north Africa or south west Europe, where they have regular wintering
patches and feed on fruiting shrubs. In Germany blackcaps have been kept
in cages, in some cases for 10 yers, and deprived of the visual rhythm
of the seasons. Still they flutter their wings and point south in autumn
for long enough to get to their wintering grounds. From this
''Zugunruhe'', the scientists conclude that they have an internal clock
or ''Circannual rhythm'', and that they can orientate magnetically to
replace the star compass they use on clear nights.
All this is well known now and not unique to this distinctive species.
What is now emerging is that blackcaps are wintering in Spain in hugely
increased numbers and that this behaviour is genetic. In other words if
a group of them do well in winter in a certain place and breed well as a
result, their offspring will follow suit. The same success for the same
reasons is attaching to the blackcaps from central Europe which we feed
in our gardens in winter. Warblers on the bird table are a surprising
but increasing pleasure. How much greater the pleasure from knowing that
the woods of Cracow and Linz are echoing that fluty song as a result, or
from knowing that Darwin's laws are pushing the northern nightingales
through Laurencekirk and Drumnadrochit.

FEARS that exploration work for oil and gas near an ammunition dumping
site in the sea between Scotland and Northern Ireland might be linked to
the appearance of explosive devices on beaches were dismissed yesterday
by British Gas.
British Gas Exploration and Production said work carried out by a
drilling rig situated 5km from Beaufort's Dyke in the North Channel of
the Irish Sea was ''completely safe'' and would not agitate anything on
the sea-bed.
Company officials also stressed that detailed on-going surveillance of
the sea-bed around the rig, 3km west of Crammag Head on the Rhins of
Galloway, had revealed no evidence of the explosive devices in the area.
However a group of Scottish MPs, who are convinced that work by
British Gas on the route of a pipeline connecting Scotland and Northern
Ireland has displaced the devices, said last night that they still had
fears about any work proceeding in the North Channel and reiterated
their call for a survey of the area before any new work is started.
Beaufort's Dyke, a half-mile deep stretch of the channel, is western
Europe's biggest ammunition dump and is a suspected origin of thousands
of the devices which have been washed up on beaches in the south and
west of Scotland in recent weeks.
British Gas, which is exploring for the first time in the area,
installed the Scott Lithgow-built Global Adriatic XI rig in the sea last
week to look for oil or gas up to 8000ft or a mile-and-a-half below the
sea-bed.
The company, which plans to continue drilling there for about 40 days,
yesterday took a group of journalists to view the rig and discuss safety
and environmental aspects of the work with officials in the light of the
the public concern.
Officials stressed that the rig, which is staffed by about 95 people,
has no moving parts in contact with the sea-bed -- the drilling activity
is cased off by a 30in conductor -- and so causes no agitation there.
In addition, a nine square mile survey of the sea-bed was carried out
before installation and surveillance is undertaken continuously using
sonar transmitter receivers attached to the rig's three legs in
conjunction with a #400,000 Remotely Operated Vehicle underwater.
A total of 123 ''targets'' measuring as little as one foot in diameter
have so far been identified, of which 118 were rocks and the remainder
''small items of debris'', officials say.
They also point out that items found are logged so that anything which
has drifted into the area around the rig can be identified.
Journalists yesterday were shown a video filmed by cameras on the ROV
which revealed that the most unusual item discovered on the sea-bed
around the rig so far was a glass bottle wedged among rocks.
Dr Peter Cole, British Gas E and P's West of Britain manager, said:
''So far, we have found nothing whatsoever of any significance and we
have looked in great detail in at least a 30 to 40 metre radius of the
rig.
''If anything sinister was discovered, we could immobilise it and
would notify the Ministry of Defence immediately and it would then be a
matter for them.
''But I have to say that this is what our safety manager would call an
unforeseeable event -- it is so unlikely to happen.''
Asked about public concern about safety, he added: ''All I can say is
that we have taken every reasonable precaution to make absolutely sure
that this is a safe operation and we are totally convinced that it is.''
Dr Cole added that British Gas might follow up yesterday's press trip
by inviting concerned councillors and MPs to visit the rig to counter
''the unnecessary fears'' that some local people have. ''We feel we have
a very safe operation. You take technical risks in the exploration
business -- you don't take safety risks at all.''
Mr George Foulkes, the Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon
Valley, who is leading a delegation seeking a suspension of British
Gas's work to construct a pipeline beneath the North Channel, said
yesterday: ''My fears for any work commencing in the North Channel
remain.
''Both myself and Brian Donohoe (Labour MP for Cunninghame South) have
information regarding dumping outside the prescribed area of Beaufort's
Dyke and we are continuing our call for a full survey of the area by the
relative Government departments before any new work is commenced.''
He added: ''British Gas has obviously gone to great lengths to satisfy
the media that their work is safe. I would appreciate similar
information being made available to MPs. To commence any work until we
discover the source of the recent spate of munitions being washed up is
foolish and with scant regard for public safety.''

A #100,000 SCOTTISH Office funding programme for a specialist nursing
cancer care qualification is inadequate, according to the Royal College
of Nursing.
The Scottish secretary of the RCN, Ms June Andrews, said the level of
education among nurses working in the cancer field in Scotland was too
low and fell below the UK's recommended levels.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish Health Minister, announced the
funding earlier this week. It will allow 40 nurses to obtain the cancer
qualification.
The Minister said cancer care had been identified as one of the
Government's priorities for the National Health Service in Scotland in
1996-97 and added it would, in the longer term, contribute substantially
to patient care throughout Scotland.
Forty nurses are needed to man the Beatson Oncology Unit in Glasgow,
one of the five main cancer treatment centres in Scotland, says the RCN.
Funding for between 300 and 500 nurses would be needed to have a nurse
with the qualification on each ward at every district general hospital
in Scotland.
''While this programme has to be welcomed, it is going to do nothing
to deal with the problem we have got at the moment, which is
insufficient investment in training nurses in this area,'' said Ms
Andrews.
The RCN fears that as moves increase towards care in the community,
the burden will fall more upon district nurses, who will require more
specialist training.
Ms Andrews said hospital trusts would also have to examine carefully
their own position and decide whether they should issue guidance for
health boards on how to purchase cancer care nursing.

FREDERICK West made his 15-year-old daughter pregnant seven years
after he and his wife had sexually abused her in the cellar at 25
Cromwell Street, a jury hear yesterday.
The pregnancy ended with a miscarriage.
Anne Marie Davis, 31, yesterday described how she was frequently
beaten by her stepmother Rosemary West and insisted that her account of
events in the cellar, given to the court on Wednesday, was the truth.
She denied that she had dragged her stepmother into the sexual assault
because she could not accept that it was her own father who regularly
abused her as a child.
''I was not aware I was being abused by my father and stepmother,''
she told the court: ''Whatever they did to me was for my own good.''
Looking pale with black lines under her eyes, Mrs Davis continued her
evidence, which had been interrupted by the jury's visit to Cromwell
Street.
Rosemary West denies the murder of 10 girls and women, including that
of her 16-year-old daughter Heather and her eight-year-old stepdaughter
Charmaine.
Mrs Davis agreed that she doted on her father. As a very young child
she was so much in love with him, she recalled telling him that one day
she would marry him.
At the outset of the cross-examination Mrs Davis agreed that her
sister Charmaine had told her on many occasions that she wished to live
with her mother in Scotland.
She agreed that her father had told her that both her mother, Rena,
and Charmaine had returned north of the Border. Later she was told by
him that they were in trouble with the police and were both involved in
prostitution. According to Mrs Davis, her father insisted they had been
thrown out of Glasgow. He did not know where they had gone and said not
to raise the subject again because it upset Rosemary.
Mrs Davis was also cross-examined about her half-sister Heather.
She recalled Heather visiting her at home and begging to stay. Mrs
Davis said she advised Heather to go home, but said she would be welcome
to stay after she left school.
She agreed that Frederick West had said he had seen Heather on various
occasions after her disappearance, once saying she had dyed her hair
blonde.
After Shirley Robinson, another alleged victim, had gone missing when
pregnant with Frederick West's child, he had said she had gone to
Germany to visit her own father, said Mrs Davis.
Mrs Davis said she had had sexual intercourse with her father on many
occasions when her stepmother was not present. Sometimes this took place
in a van. A purple light would suddenly come on in the vehicle and she
knew she would have sexual intercourse with him.
''Yes, I did love my father,'' said Mrs Davis.
Mr Ferguson asked: ''You would have done anything for him?''
''I would have done anything for both Rosemary and my father,'' the
witness replied.
When Rosemary West had arrived she had placed a wedge between her and
her father, said Mrs Davis. It felt as if someone was intruding into the
family.
Mrs Davies also recalled an occasion when as a child she was undressed
by Rosemary West. The other children in the house, who were playing with
handpaints, were then encouraged to draw designs on her body.
Mrs West wrote the words ''black hole'' with an arrow pointing
downwards on Anne Marie's back. She was made to stay like that until her
father returned from work so he could see it.
Mrs Davis agreed she had been a bully at school. Nevertheless, she
denied she had been disruptive at home. ''I tried to do as I was told,''
she told the court. ''I am not saying I was not difficult, but I was not
unruly.''
In the household it was her stepmother who did the telling off.
However, she recalled a situation when she had tried to intervene in an
argument between her father and her stepmother. He pulled her by the
hair to the ground and kicked her in the face.
Mrs Davis recalled that her stepmother would strike her with anything
which came to hand -- a spoon, a saucepan, a belt or a broom.
Mrs Davis agreed that she had contacts with the media. She had already
been paid #3000 and was co-operating in the writing of a book.
She did not want money from this: ''To me it is blood money,'' she
said. However, she had been told that she had to think of her children.
''All I wanted was for my family and the victims to be here,'' she
said.
Asked if at any time she had suspected her father had killed anyone,
she replied: ''I didn't know about anything until recently.''
The jury heard that Mrs Rosemary West was interviewed by police in
1992 in connection with an event unconnected with the current trial, and
was questioned over Heather's whereabouts. During the interview Mrs West
alleged that she had spoken to Heather on the telephone. She said she
was sure she was all right.
Yesterday the defence admitted that the remains of a child recovered
from 25 Midland Road were those of Charmaine.
The trial continues on Monday.

* THE trial at Winchester Crown Court had a delayed start yesterday
because Mrs Davis had become indisposed overnight. She had been due to
arrive at Court 3 at 10.30am when Mr Richard Ferguson, QC, defending,
was scheduled to cross-examine her.
Having explained the delay to the jury, Mr Justice Mantell made it
clear he was anxious Mrs Davis's evidence did not continue into the
afternoon.

AUDITORS from Glasgow District Council are looking at the accounts of
a community project in the south side of the city.
The move comes in the wake of an investigation into the alleged misuse
of public funds allocated to community projects in the East End.
The chief executive of Glasgow District Council, Mr Tom Monaghan,
said: ''As part of the monitoring process which the council carries out
on urban aid projects, the audit section of the finance department is
examining financial systems of Toryglen Community Hall. They are
examining records and systems relating to that hall.''
He pointed out that the council had monitoring systems and every so
often these uncovered situations worthy of examination. ''It's a form of
assistance to these organisations,'' said Mr Monaghan.
It is understood that the police have not so far been involved in the
inquiry.

INTO THE INTERIOR
A remarkable new book by Shelia Mackay draws on the archiveof the
National Monuments Records of Sotland to illustrate the rich seam of
decorative art in a country which can be slow to sing of its own
achievements
THE homes of Victorians, as well as their attitudes and aspirations,
are easier imaginatively to reconstruct and understand than those of any
previous age as, for the first time, photography as well as a wealth of
historical documents recorded actual interiors.
Photography harnesses conjecture to a reality which was previously
inaccessible, except for a few examples of pictorial representation of
interiors in the coloured plans of William Adam and other architects of
the previous century, and a few paintings such as those of Alexander
Carse. As the wealthy exploiters of Victorian invention, technology,
innovation, and industry ordered up castles and country houses from the
successful architects of the day, cities burgeoned with housing for the
new breed of middle-class professionals as well as for the workers who
served the new industries.
The nineteenth century was the age of the city. From the 1830s,
spaciously planned urban developments of crescents and circuses were
laid out west of Glasgow, while south of the Clyde, superior suburbs
sprang up downwind of industry. ''The first of them, Pollokshields,
shows a very different taste from the classical circuses and crescents
north of the river,'' says Elizabeth Williamson describing David Rhind's
1849 development as ''more loosely picturesque, with roads lined with
villas following the contours of the hills.''
Villa suburbs such as Perth Road, Dundee, and Newington and Trinity,
Edinburgh, pre-dated Pollokshields. A few salubrious Glasgow suburbs
sprouted on land purchased by businessmen round clusters of Georgian
country villas and all the leafy suburbs swelled later in the century
with the advent of trams and the suburban railway.
The industrial suburbs were a different matter: street after street of
gaunt tenements provided for workers associated with the coal and
iron-ore industries deterred the affluent from moving east, north, and
south of the Clyde. Model industrial settlements were attempted at
Cowlairs for railway workers, at Possilpark for Saracen Foundry
employees, and similar planned communities, some philanthropic, appeared
at Scotstoun, Jordanhill, and Springburn. These ''respectable''
tenements were designed with a room and kitchen, each with a box bed, or
as ''single ends'' with room and kitchen combined. And variations on the
tenement theme erupted throughout Scotland on the back of industry, in
cities and new towns such as Greenock and Paisley and shanty towns like
Blantyre and the Monklands. Shared privies were in the communal
courtyard, or back green, until 1892 regulations ordered them inside.
From the beginning of the century, Glasgow's Industrial Revolution had
been fuelled by plentiful supplies of cheap labour: migrants from the
Highlands and immigrants from Ireland. Almost a quarter of a million
Highlanders lived in Glasgow, working in cotton mills, railway
construction and, seasonally, on lowland farms. Among their number were
the ancestors of Donald Mackenzie of 12 Lower Ardelve who brought back
coins bearing the head of George III, which were later mounted on a
piece of varnished wood from Donald's boat. The inscription read:
''1812: Tokens for lodgings given in Glasgow to men from the Highlands
who came to give their labour in the Industrial Revolution and leave
their mark in shipbuilding and engineering that exists to this day''.
The house they and Donald inhabited is a listed building, now under
the care of Historic Scotland; its rare and precious thatching
maintained by Cairdean nan Taighean Tagha (Friends of the Thatched
Houses). 12 Lower Ardelve is an empty shell now, but wind and
watertight, clinging to the very earth, like some ancient prehistoric
broch. When I visited him in 1986, Donald told me that his father and
his father before him lived here, and the boys who brought back the
coins before that. If you consider that Donald's father was born in
1856, that's going back a bit.
Season after season the house has resisted the changes which time had
impressed on other croft houses (ruins or heaps of rubble on the
landscape) leaving this, the only thoroughbred: a fact made final in
1974 when an official preservation order dropped through the door
stating that 12 Lower Ardelve was now a listed building. Thus, just as
Donald might have been getting round to making a few changes, fate
decreed otherwise. But, as he pointed out, number 12 was as important in
its own way as the sovereign's residence at Balmoral.
At the fireside he conjured up memories and stories of crofting days
which were over for him now; past 80 years old, yet he still rode a
bicycle to exercise his arthritic knee. He explained that a single
chimney in the centre of the room once sent the smoke up through a
central hole in the roof. Later, two fireplaces were constructed with
wooden chimneys in the gable ends. This was one, where we sat, a hanging
lum, a near-unique survival. Wood was the fuel now, instead of peat
which Donald remembered being set, damp blocks to the back of the fire,
dry to the front, under the all-purpose Dutch oven which his mother
baked in. He demonstrated with his hands how she lifted hot ashes on to
its lid to cook the top of rounds of scones. And she produced
slow-simmered soups and stews too, though herring and potatoes were the
mainstay of the family diet.
On the other side of the fence, the burgeoning middle classes invested
in property and the richest set up as landed gentry, emulating the
elaborate codes of behaviour of the older ''upper classes'' which, as
Mark Girouard suggests, ''was partly a defensive sieve or initiatory
rite, designed to keep out the wrong people''.
Ayton Castle in Berwickshire is the finest example of the grand
baronial houses which the architect James Gillespie Graham was called
upon to construct for nouveaux riches clients eager to emulate ''old
family'' values. It is the most prominent of country houses viewed from
the East Coast Edinburgh to London railway line which cuts a swathe
across the 5000-acre estate: a spectacular sight admired every day by
countless British Rail passengers. Even visitors approaching by road are
struck by Ayton's dominance of the landscape, rather as pilgrims
approaching a medieval abbey must have been.
The castle in its mid-century heyday was run by a fleet of 40
servants, including laundry, garden, and stable staff. Butler and
housekeeper presided over the indoor staff while the head gardener and
head groom ruled the outdoor workers. Tending the central-heating system
which pushed hot air through the corridors, the coal fires and candles
in the rooms, the fetching and carrying of water before the house was
plumbed later in the century, were tasks that had to be performed
several times a day. When, eventually, the houses was plumbed, one of
Gillespie Graham's towers was commandeered to contain a water tank of
650 gallons capacity supplied, as it is today, from the estate.
At the end of the nineteenth century new technology produced two new
categories of country-house servant: the chauffeur and the electrician.
Today, the interiors of Ayton are managed by two part-time local women
armed, of course, with the latest technology of which the vacuum cleaner
is still the most revolutionary.

A SCHOOLBOY raped a three-year-old-boy he was babysitting because he
wondered what sex was like, a court heard yesterday.
The 14-year-old, who was sentenced to two years' detention at a secure
unit after pleading guilty to rape, told police he became curious about
sex when school friends discussed it.
The case, at Liverpool Crown Court, involved one of the youngest ever
male rape victims and attacker. Legislation introducing the offence only
came into force at the end of last year.
Judge Sean Duncan described it as an outrageous offence which society
could not tolerate.
Before the teenager, who cannot be identified, was led from the dock,
Judge Duncan said: ''People will try to help you and it is important you
take that help, but it is equally important to know that we are
punishing you.''
Defence counsel Andrew Mattison said that the boy was genuinely
contrite and had started receiving therapy.

A PROCESSION of toll protesters, led by pipers and a Saltire bearer,
will attempt to block the Skye bridge for a second time at lunchtime
today.
A ''freedom convoy'' of cars will drive from Portree at noon,
collecting supporters around the island, before crossing the bridge to
the Kyle of Lochalsh, where they will refuse to pay the #4.30 toll.
They will be met by sympathisers from the mainland and will then cross
back to the island en masse to protest again.
The organisers, Skat (Skye and Kyle Against Tolls), hope to bring the
bridge to a standstill while police deal with each individual motorist.
The convoy follows a demonstration early on Wednesday morning in which
motorists blocked bridge barriers for several hours. About 35 people
were charged.
Skat announced yesterday that a mainland sister organisation, Erat
(Easter Ross Against Tolls), had been formed and appealed for further
support. Veteran campaigner Robbie the Pict, speaking for Skat, said:
''If the island can produce 30 people at 1am, the rest of Scotland can
help us out with a few bodies.
''This is a national issue -- these tolls are unconstitutional and
constitute virtual robbery. We are going to show the Skye Bridge Company
we can overload their crossing at will.''
The group, which has appointed three lawyers to defend those charged
for non-payment, was considering a number of legal counter-arguments to
the tolls.
Among them will be to demand that barrier operators produce a personal
warrant signed by the Secretary of State before asking for money.
Meanwhile, the prominent Scottish nationalist lawyer, Mr Ian Hamilton,
QC, said the high cost of toll charges may be in breach of the European
Convention of Human Rights.
''The European Union is about freedom of movement. A financial
requirement of movement, from the inhabitants of one of the poorest
islands in Europe may deny them that justice which the European Union
guarantees to us all,'' he said.
''The people of Skye, about their essential business like other
Europeans, should drive past the toll booths without paying, until the
matter has been judicially decided by the European Court.''

A UNION has accused supermarket giant Asda of cutting the pay of its
Sunday workers.
The GMB, which represents 30,000 Asda workers, said last night the
company was effectively abolishing double-time rates for new staff
working on Sunday as well as weekdays.
New workers will now receive only one-and-a-half times the normal rate
of pay of #3.67 -- an effective drop of #1.87 an hour, the union said.
This means they will be #11.01 a day worse off, a spokeswoman said.
The union will calling for a debate in Parliament on the issue.
Donna Covey, a union national officer, said: ''The GMB is devastated
by this betrayal of solemn assurances given to the House of Commons when
the Sunday Trading Bill was going through the house.
''If they had given any inkling that it was their intention to cut the
pay for Sunday workers, MPs would never have voted to legalise Sunday
trading.
''We are calling for a meeting of our senior shop stewards in Asda
next Thursday to discuss the position and I am writing to Tony Newton,
the Leader of the House, to ask for an urgent debate on the issue.''
But Asda dismissed the claim as ''utter rubbish''.
A spokesman said the move was in line with other chains who pay the
one-and-a-half premium rate on Sundays and would allow more flexibility
and a greater freedom of choice to workers.
He said: ''A lot of people want to do work during the week and on
Sunday. Currently they feel discriminated against. This is totally in
line with our commitment to let colleagues work as many hours as they
want.''
Mr Michael Meacher, Labour employment spokesman, said: ''This is
clearly a major cut in pay, dressed up in terms of fancy phrases such as
'flexibility' and 'freedom'.
''It is in fact a reneging on commitments clearly given at the time of
the Sunday Trading Bill.
''I shall be raising the issue as a matter of urgency in Parliament on
Monday.''

<HEADLINE>Major to meet Argentine leader in New York</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE British and Argentine leaders will meet formally for the first
time since the Falklands war 13 years ago, it was revealed yesterday.
Prime Minister John Major will hold talks with his Argentine president
Carlos Menem in New York on Monday.
The two leaders are travelling to New York for official ceremonies to
mark the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.
Relations with Argentina were strained in the aftermath of the 1982
conflict and Argentina has refused to withdraw its claim of sovereignty
over the South Atlantic islands.
Diplomatic relations were restored in 1990 and officials and Ministers
have been working behind-the-scenes to develop relations.
Britain and Argentina signed a deal in September to co-operate over
oil exploration in the disputed waters around the Falklands.
British officials and Falkland Islands leaders are both adamant that
the sovereignty of the South Atlantic dependency is protected in the
agreement.
Mr Menem provoked uproar days before the agreement when he claimed the
deal was the first ''real, legal step forward'' in his country's
struggle to regain sovereignty.
The two leaders will discuss the oil deal, which has established a
joint UK-Argentine hydro-carbon commission to oversee the issue of oil
exploration licences. Whitehall officials insisted the thorny question
of sovereignty would not be raised. The meeting, set up at the request
of Argentina, was being protrayed in London as the next step in a
gradual process of placing relations with Buenos Aires back on to a
normal footing. Mr Menem has publicly expressed interest in visiting
Britain but officials insisted it was ''premature'' to talk in terms of
an official invitation being issued.
Oil companies are said to be showing growing interest in exploration
since the signing of the oil deal removed many of the political
uncertainties surrounding relations between Britain and Argentina.

SHELL Expro has awarded a #55m contract for a fixed-wing aircraft
service between Aberdeen and Sumburgh in Shetland to Southend-based
British World Airlines.
It will bring into service two ATR 72-210 turboprop aircraft
manufactured by the joint Anglo/French/Italian consortium in Toulouse to
fulfil the five-year deal.
The ATRs will replace three 74-seat Vickers Viscount aircraft which
the airline will convert into Freightmasters. The first of the aircraft
will arrive next April.
The fixed-wing flights are used to transport offshore workers between
Aberdeen and Sumburgh where they transfer to helicopters for flights to
offshore installations in the East Shetland Basin.
''This contract award is tribute to the efforts put in by all at
British World over the last 12 years and in particular our Aberdeen and
Sumburgh based personnel,'' said British World Airlines chief executive
Robert Sturman.
''These will be the first new aircraft ever operated by British World
and marks a significant step forward for the company. 1996 will be our
50th anniversary and it looks like being a very busy year.''
Established as Silver City Airways in 1946, British World Airlines is
one of the UK's largest and most successful regional air transport
operators, employing more than 500 people and with a turnover of more
than #50m.

Special Travel Correspondent Katie Wood runs a practised eye over the
best of the travel bargains
WHEN thinking of a short autumn break we will all too often ignore
what's on our own doorstep. With Autumn Gold now in full swing and
discounted beds throughout Scotland's cities, there's never been a
better time to head for Edinburgh or Glasgow for a weekend away. Why not
combine it with a bit of culture?
Scottish Opera's financial plight has been highlighted recently and
the company deserves all the support it can get. This autumn it is
holding a season packed with goodies in Scotland's two largest cities.
Highly recommended is the new production of La Belle Helene -- a
delightful satire on ancient Greek myth and legend with music by
Offenbach. Tickets from just #3.50. Call 01441 227 5511 for performance
details.
So, don't forget Scottish cities this autumn -- they really are the
biggest bargain out.
* SKI at Killington in Vermont for #419 for 11 nights. This tour is
offered by Grampian Tours, the specialist ski operator owned by AT Mays.
Departure is March 3 from Glasgow using British Airways flights.
Also on offer in their 1996 ski programme is a good deal to the
Rockies, with prices from #549 for 13 nights on Air Canada flights from
Glasgow. If you're really adventurous, why not try their Ski Safari to
Colorado? This gives the skier the opportunity to try seven resorts in
two weeks. The lead-in price for this is #509 for 13 nights, again
flying Air Canada from Glasgow. Call 01738 635370 for a brochure.
* STILL on skiing, Sally Ferries has put together a special deal for
skiers this Winter aimed at the independent ski market. For #135 you get
a return ferry crossing for a car and two adults, insurance for AA Five
Star standard cover, and AA Personal Winter Sports cover. Travel agents
have details.
* HONG KONG may never be the same again after 1997 and as that date
approaches many people feel the urge to visit this exciting British
outpost. If you're looking for a good deal there's one currently on
offer from Virgin Holidays. For #599 you get 4 nights in a 4-star hotel
plus economy flights with Virgin Airways and transfers to/from airport.
This fare is valid until November 30. Call 01293 617181 for
reservations.
* LOOKING for a last-minute flight-only deal? Avro are offering Malaga
on October 30 for #114 for a six or 13-night stay. Another still-hotspot
for sun-seekers is Tenerife which comes in at #149 departing October 31
for seven or 14 nights for #149. Both flights are ex-Glasgow. Call 0141
303 0303 for more details.
* CHEAP flights to South Africa are few and far between, but
Caledonian Airways, in association with Bluebird Holidays, is offering a
new Gatwick-Jo'burg service for just #489 return -- a considerable
saving on SAA and BA's quoted prices. The DC10 service departs twice
weekly on Monday and Thursday and this is to be a year-round service.
The first flight departs Gatwick November 16. Call 01444 235678 for
details.
* I'D be the last one to knock the wonderfully priced new Ryanair
service to London, but two things to note amid all the hype: Although
the ads say Glasgow, Prestwick is the departure point in Scotland --
presumably Irish geography is in play here as Prestwick is NOT Glasgow.
Also there's only 15,000 seats per month available at the lowest fare
price of #59. so unless you're in first, you may be paying #69, #79 or
#99 for your seat. If this is the case you may be better off looking at
the genuine Glasgow departures from BA, B Mid and Air UK.
* WHY not keep your holiday arrangements local? There are quite a few
small specialist tour operators based in Scotland after all, and they
could do with our support in this difficult time in the travel industry.
One such company is Finlays. Based in Ancrum in The Borders, they offer
dedicated skiing and golfing packages. Skiing is chalet-based in
Courchevel and Val d'Isere. Scottish flights can be arranged and prices
start at a healthy #260 for a week in self-catering accommodation,
rising to #510 in a chalet over New Year. Their golfing holidays are
based in the South West of France. Including flights from London,
transfers, three-star accommodation, breakfast and a round of golf a day
the cost ranges from #370 to #475 for four-six days. Call 01835 830562
for brochures.
* THINKING of a night at Phantom of the Opera in Edinburgh? Why not
make a weekend of it and stay in the capital city (Christmas shopping
looms . . .) A weekend break at an unbeatable price is currently being
offered by Best of Scotland Holidays. Accommodation is at the King James
Thistle Hotel, seats are reserved for the 7.30pm performance on Saturday
and you have two nights accommodation in a twin/double room, dinner on
Friday evening, full breakfast each morning and your tickets thrown in
-- for just #99 per person. This has got to be the best bargain break
out. Call 01333 360395 for more details. (Offer runs November-February
excluding the festive period).
* DE-STRESSING is an increasingly popular way to spend your leisure
time so you'll not be surprised to learn that there are now holidays
based on doing just that.
One such event is happening this coming week in the Peak District.
Countrywide Holidays are offering a four-night break starting October 23
which covers the common uses of Aromatherapy. The cost is a modest #135
per person which includes full-board country guest house accommodation
and no single room supplements apply. Call 0161 224 2855 for details.
This side of the border at Gillyflowers, Drumnadrochit (tel 01456
450641) you can sign up for a course of hypnotherapy while enjoying the
delights of Loch Ness scenery. An eighteenth-century farmhouse is the
base for a three-night break where music and the spoken word are used to
tap into the subconscious mind. The cost -- a mere #78.

THREE workers were injured when they fell 470ft in a maintenance lift
while working on a TV mast yesterday.
The lift hit safety buffers 30ft from the ground on the 1200ft Belmont
transmitter near Louth, Lincolnshire.
The cage collapsed under the impact and the men were trapped in the
wreckage for nearly two hours.
Experts estimate the metal lift was travelling at 100mph as it fell.
Firefighters using special hydraulic gear had to cut it open to
release the three men who all suffered serious injuries to the lower
body. They were brought out through an opening on stretchers.
A fire brigade spokesman said: ''It must have been a terrifying
experience. They really are lucky to be alive.''
They were examined and given oxygen by paramedics before being taken
by ambulance to Louth County Hospital.
Four fire engines and three ambulances were sent to the scene. The man
who alerted police to the accident told officers he had heard a
''wooshing noise'' before the machine crashed into the safety barriers
at the base of the lift shaft.
It was thought the three men, who all suffered leg injuries, did not
lose consciousness throughout the ordeal, even though it took rescuers
nearly two hours to free them.
One of the men suffered a broken ankle and was operated on at Louth
County Hospital, his two colleagues received treatment at Lincoln County
Hospital. A hospital spokeswoman said both had suffered ankle injuries,
but neither was seriously hurt.
Last night the injured men were named as Mr Jim Burrows, Mr Richard
Walton, and Mr Mark Spencer.
Officials from the Health and Safety Executive are trying to discover
what caused the lift to fall.

A BEGGAR in a wheelchair who threatened to shoot a woman when she
refused him money was jailed for nine months yesterday.
Shadow Henry, 22, approached his victim Ms Linda McLocklin in London's
Victoria Station last November. Without warning, he blocked her path
with his electric wheelchair and demanded change.
When she told him she did not have any, he swore and threatened: ''I
have got this gun and I can shoot you with it.''
He then pulled up his T-shirt, exposing a black replica handgun. Ms
McLocklin ran off and asked a railway official for help. Police were
called and the weapon, loaded with blanks, was recovered.
Henry, of Lewis Road, Saunderpark Rise, Brighton, East Sussex, was
also found to be carrying a mobile telephone.
The court heard that despite his years of disability Henry, who
admitted one charge of possessing an imitation firearm, had previous
convictions for possessing offensive weapons.

SPICES have always carried an air of the exotic East, of scent-laden
air and of teeming market places.
Antony Wild's attractive pocket volume does nothing to detract from
the romance and mystery of what have now become staples of the kitchen.
Beautifully illustrated and pleasingly laid out, his story ranges from
the holy oils infused with spices used by the Babylonians, Assyrians and
ancient Egyptians to the #1 billion a year market of today.
Yorshire-born Wild's journeys in the Indian sub-continent were the
catalyst for an enduring interest in the activities of the East India
Company, which had such an empire-building role in the development of
the trade.
Next time you reach for the chilli pepper, illustrated above, be aware
that the Mayans and the Aztecs used it to flavour cocoa; or the
cardamom, valued by the Egyptians as a breath freshener; or the
coriander, known to medieaval farmers as ''dizzycorn'' because of its
narcotic effect on animals.

Golf on the islands of the pacific is not only a battle with your
handicap, but with nature. David Wishart visits the moonsape with greens
to try some of the most spectacular courses in the world
THE first view of Hawaii's Big Island from a window of the Aloha
Airlines Boeing 737 leads to the thought that there has been a mistake:
we are about to land on the moon.
The view consists of nothing but lava rock and volcanoes. Indeed, one
large volcano is not far away, very much alive, and spewing out 650,000
cubic yards of red-hot molten rock every day. Then the eye catches the
strips of green, and dots so white they sparkle like diamonds.
These are the golf courses of the Big Island, so called because it is
the biggest of the Hawaiian chain, and also, incidentally, the largest
tropical island in the world.
The moonscape continues from the airport along the Kohala coast road
as it cuts through a seemingly-endless black desert of lava. To the
right it is a wilderness climbing into the cloud-shrouded Mauna Kea
volcano (elevation 13,796ft and, happily, dormant) and far to the left a
handful of hotels is sprinkled along the water's edge.
It takes half an hour to reach Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, where the legend
of Hawaiian golf began in 1964. Laurance Rockeller asked Robert Trent
Jones Sen if he could build a golf course here. Jones picked up two
pieces of the sharp, black rock, rubbed them together, and felt them
crumble. ''You've got your course,'' he said.
What Jones didn't say was that he had never seen land less suitable
for a golf course -- that was until he got the idea of crushing lava
rock, bringing in topsoil and laying out fairways between the lava
flows. It was a revolutionary idea that changed golf-course design in
Hawaii, and since then many other golf courses on several Hawaiian
islands have been built over lava.
The stark blackness of the rock makes for a vivid contrast with the
lush fairways and greens. Add to that swaying palm trees, a brilliant
blue sky, dollops of ocean topped with whitecaps and sunshine all year,
and you've got golf at its most exotic.
Mauna Kea has some great holes, such as the third, a par three of 180
yards that crosses a cove washed by pounding surf.
The nearby Mauna Lani Resort has a similar hole, No 15 on the south
course, so popular that a staff photographer is often stationed on the
tee.
It is a stunningly beautiful spot and worth every moment of the long
trip here, jetlag, and the monumental green fee, about #100 give or take
a bob or two. I'd imagine that one day's takings here equal the annual
income at Brodick Golf Club.
But whereas Mauna Kea has encouraged tropical vegetation around the
fairways, the two Mauna Lani courses do not. The rough here is huge
chunks of lava rock, meaning that a sliced drive is history. You might
find your ball, but you won't like what you see after an encounter with
razor-sharp lava; it looks like a shark attack.
The 19th hole here rejoices in the name of Knickers (as the Americans
call plus-fours) and if you need shelter there are two luxury hotels,
the Mauna Lani Bay and the Ritz-Carlton. The Mauna Lani has five
waterfront bungalows, priced at $3500 a day, which go to the golf pros
when they come by for the annual Senior Skins game that is televised
throughout the world.
It's a far cry from the beginnings of golf in Hawaii, more than 100
years ago when sugar plantations were built on most of the islands, and
the men who ran them were invariably Scots. They were the engineers and
the managers, who lived grandly in mansions with wide verandas, a style
imported from India and today known as the plantation look.
And as Joe Root told me, thanks to these Scots every island also had a
nine-hole golf course. Root, director of golf at Mauna Kea as well as
the Hapuna course, a new Arnold Palmer design, is a great fan of
Scottish courses and tries to get over every two years.
Another pro who loves the Scottish experience is Dennis Rose, director
of golf at the two Waikoloa Resort courses. The Kings' course was
designed by Tom Weiskopf and Jay Morrish along the lines of a Scottish
links course. The nearby Beach course, designed by Robert Trent Jones
Jun, rejoices in a 12th hole that lures players to a green poised on the
edge of the Pacific Ocean.
A few miles inland and almost 3000 feet up a steep hillside lies
Makalei Hawaii Country Club, a new course with far-flung views, wild
turkeys and peacocks, while the hazard by the eighth green is a
man-sized lava tube that yawns out of the hillside as a reminder of the
fiery beginnings here.
It was at Makalei this winter that I met Matt Lygate, former Scottish
Walker Cup captain who lives in Troon, and George Currie, a Glaswegian
with a trucking business in Los Angeles.
George, having a home in nearby Kona, qualifies for the locals' green
fee of $45, whereas visitors have to pay between $70 and $110, and that
is the big drawback of golf in Hawaii. Green fees go up to $150,
although if you are resident at a hotel or condo within the same resort
the rate is reduced. There are often twilight rates as well, and my
advice is to seek them out. At Makalei it is $50 after 1.30pm.
For less expensive outings you have to go to the other side of the Big
Island, to Naniloa Country Club, next to the Hilo Hawaiian, where it
costs $25 weekdays, and for a few dollars more you can play Volcano Golf
Club, situated just a few miles from Kilauea's lava flow. If this makes
you nervous bring along a little gin, said to placate Pele, Hawaii's
volcano goddess.
Or maybe it's time to hop on an inter-island Aloha flight to Maui,
where you'll fly by the imposing 10,023ft peak of Haleakala, the House
of the Sun volcano, where American astronauts trained for their 1969
moon landing. But relax -- it's been dormant since 1790. These days it's
a place to camp, hike, and ride horses.
Sixteen of Hawaii's 70 golf courses are on Maui, and three of them
dwell enticingly together at the beautiful resort of Kapalua. The
scorecard rating says the Bay course is the most difficult, but locals
don't agree, and they're right. It may be the most scenic, with several
holes skirting the shoreline and the fifth calling for a shot over the
water.
High-handicappers will actually feel more comfortable on the Bay
course because there is not much rough, whereas the Plantation layout is
only for the strong of heart. Designers Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw had
fun with this one, coming up with a 555-yard 15th with two doglegs and a
closing hole of 663 yards.
But then there is the wind, always a big factor in Hawaii. Davis Love,
playing in a Kapalua International tournament, made that eighteenth
green with a drive and a six iron.
My favourite is the Village course, which climbs uphill through
luxuriant vegetation for five splendid holes, then rewards the golfer
with a first of a series of elevated tees where your target is the
shimmering Pacific Ocean framed between pineapple fields. There is
nothing better than this in winter golf.
Just down the road are the two Royal Kaanapali courses, both busy but
well worth your time. The North course is tougher and enjoys spectacular
ocean views.
Head through the old whaling town of Lahaina and you're on the road to
Wailea, where the Blue and Orange courses have been entertaining golfers
for years. The Orange has been redesigned and renamed the Emerald, and a
new course, the Gold, is now drawing rave reviews. Along with the two
Makena courses nearby, both affording great golf and ocean vistas,
Wailea can be a complete golf destination.
Wailea has a good variety of accommodation from condos, which can be
shared inexpensively by families and friends, to luxury hotels such as
the Grand Wailea Resort, at $600m the most expensive hotel in the world
to build.
The quiet, unhurried pace of Wailea is found all over the island of
Kauai, where Captain James Cook first made landfall in Hawaii in 1778.
Robert Trent Jones Jun has been busy here, designing four of the seven
golf courses including the Prince course at the Princeville Hotel, a
beautiful property just reopened after hurricane damage.
The islands of Molokai and Lanai are off the beaten track, but still
in play for golfers. Molokai has two courses, one of them worth an
outing.
As for the pineapple island of Lanai, until recently there was not
much to do here, other than snorkel, enjoy a fine beach at Manele Bay,
or play that nine-hole course the early Scots built. But with the
decline in the pineapple trade has come something new -- beautiful
resorts at Manele Bay and the Lodge at Koele, and with them new golf
courses designed by Greg Norman/Ted Robinson and Jack Nicklaus.
Deer and pheasant roam the Koele course, which has the only bent grass
greens in Hawaii. It is a superb layout, while the views from the Manele
course will take your breath away. The lucky pro in charge of both these
courses is Gary Campbell, and like half of America he has a Scottish
connection. Green fees are $130, but a more affordable $65 for hotel
guests.
Finally, Oahu, the main island where you'll find Honolulu airport and
Waikiki. The Prince Hotel group has a shuttle to their course out at
Ewa, where the power carts may be unique in that each carries four
players. The new Ko Olina course near the airport anchors the Ihilani
resort, while in Waikiki itself there's the Ala Wai municipal course.
This course is something else. It is the world's busiest, playing 550
rounds a day or 180,000 a year. It costs only $20 but seemingly
impossible to get on due to the number of tour groups and the tenacity
of locals, who jam the booking lines from the moment they open.
According to local golfer Steve Boyle, it's more like a firing range
than a golf course.
Boyle is general manager of the New Otani Hotel, located at the far
end of Waikiki beach so that it enjoys a small beach to itself and is
also a quiet oasis, yet it is just a 15-minute walk from the heart of
Waikiki and its restaurants, bars and shops.
Someone who used to make that walk was Robert Louis Stevenson, who
passed through Hawaii on his way to his future home, and final resting
place, in Samoa. Stevenson stayed for five weeks in a guest house on the
same beach, known then and today as Sans Souci. He became friendly with
the daughter of the last king of Hawaii, and often had tea with her at
her home in Waikiki. The site of that house is now marked by a street
called Tusitala, meaning teller of tales in Samoan.
A book about Scots in Hawaii has just been published in Honolulu, so
if you're coming this way, it might be useful in tracking down long-lost
relatives. Who knows, they might just be golf pros or hoteliers.
FURTHER INFORMATION
* NOVEMBER is the best time to go for good weather and cheaper rates,
but Hawaii does a steady tourist business year-round with peaks at
Christmas, January, February and Easter.
Contact Hawaii Visitors Bureau, 56-60 Great Cumberland Place, Marble
Arch, London W1H 8DD, 0171 723 7011 or fax 0171 724 2808. A quick call
or fax to the HVB in London should provide information on British-based
travel companies which offer travel packages including golf in Hawaii.
As we are talking exotic travel here, consider stopping off in the US
or Canada to ski. Whistler resort, for example, is near Vancouver.
Canadian Airlines can take you all the way, from London direct to
Vancouver, then non-stop to Honolulu. It's about nine hours to Vancouver
and another five to Honolulu.
Still interested? What about carrying on from Honolulu by Garuda to
Bali, where there's more exotic golf, and then home from there?
Talk to any travel agent about round-the-world fares.

A BANK manager cleared of embezzling #163,000 worth of old bank notes
has dropped his unfair sacking claim against the Clydesdale Bank.
Earlier this year, a jury at the High Court in Glasgow found Mr Hector
MacGillivray, 54, not guilty of taking the money from ''burning boxes''
set aside for incineration.
After his trial Mr MacGillivray, of Thomson Drive, Bearsden, said he
planned to pursue his unfair dismissal complaint against the bank before
an industrial tribunal.
Last night Mr MacGillivray said: ''There were a number of reasons why
I decided against continuing the fight.
''The principal reason was the hurt and distress that the whole matter
had brought to my wife and our two boys. It had become obvious that the
bank were going to rake up all the things that were said at the trial
and I just didn't want my family to be subjected to all the hurt of that
again.
''In many ways my wife had the hardest time of all in that one day her
husband was a bank manager and the next facing serious criminal charges.
''We have just started to get over the court case and get our lives
back together again and it wasn't fair to bring it all up once more.
There was also the whole financial position as we are not in a
particularly good state in that department.
''I had already spent around #5000 in preparation for the tribunal and
I faced at least the same bill again for the five-day hearing. I just
couldn't afford it.
''In some ways I wanted my day in court but I couldn't afford it in
personal terms or in financial ones.
''I am still off ill with chronic depressive illness and my main
priority is to get my health back and going on with the tribunal would
just have delayed that whole process.''
Mr MacGillivray's unfair sacking claim was made in June 1993, shortly
after his dismissal, but was held over until criminal proceedings had
been concluded.
The Glasgow tribunal was due to hear Mr MaGillivray's unfair sacking
claim later this year but he withdrew his tribunal application.

<HEADLINE>South-east bias in cash grants prompts call for separate 'Scot Lot' to ensure fair play. London hits the lottery jackpot.</HEADLINE>

A SURVEY revealed last night that a quarter of all National Lottery
cash grants have gone to Greater London, and that Londoners have
benefited to the tune of around #21 a head.
This is almost seven times as much as the corresponding figure for
Strathclyde, which has received just more than #3 a head.
In an angry response to the figures, SNP home affairs spokesman
Roseanna Cunningham said the London bias strengthened calls for a
separate Scottish National Lottery, which she dubbed ''Scot Lot''.
''That would ensure that Scottish causes and Scottish projects are
always given fair play,'' she said.
More than #574m of lottery money has been spent so far and an
investigation into the cash distribution has revealed major disparities
from area to area.
The survey, carried out by the Directory of Social Change into the 12
lottery regions, has shown that Greater London received more than #141m,
equal to around #20.74 for every single person.
Scotland is the third best off lottery region behind
Yorkshire/Humberside, the English region receiving #65m, around #13.18
per head of population. Scotland gets around #52m, which works out at
#10.95 of grant per head. Five other regions of the UK receive between
#5 and #10 per head, with the least well off being the East Midlands,
which receives #3.50 per person.
Mr John Rafferty, director of the National Lottery Charities Board in
Scotland, defended the pay-outs north of the Border, saying: ''The trend
which the Directory of Social Change has illustrated is clearly caused
by large capital grants being made by the Arts Council to projects in
London.
''The grants which the charity board of Scotland will announce on
Monday will clearly reverse this trend. We will be giving out grants
from Shetlands to the Borders.''
Around #17.5m is likely to be distributed to about 200 organisations
in Scotland by the Edinburgh-based lottery charities board on Monday.
A closer analysis of the #52m given to Scotland so far from the
National Lottery shows that Strathclyde has received around #6.5m, equal
to #3.15 per person, and Lothian has received #11.5m, which is #16.01
per head.
Around #25 has been spent per head in Grampian region, which has
received some #12m in total. Grampian is the fourth highest region in
Britain for lottery hand-outs based on population, behind South
Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hampshire.
In other parts of Scotland the grants have worked out at #4.30 per
head of population in Dumfries, #3 per head in Tayside, Fife #1.30,
Shetland #2.27, Central Scotland #2.39, and Orkney 95p.
Ms Cunningham said the figures and the London bias was the key feature
of how the UK is governed and was only to be expected. She added: ''It
will come as no surprise to Scots to learn that this is how the
so-called 'National' Lottery is run.''
Mr Luke Fitzherbert, of the Directory of Social Change, which compiled
the UK-wide regional breakdown for last night's Newsnight programme,
said there were problem areas in distribution of the cash.
He said: ''There is the old story, the pull of London against the rest
of Britain -- and this is showing that a quarter of all the money is
coming down to just one city in the South-east of England.''
Mr Fitzherbert admitted large one-off grants can distort the figures
for the different regions.
As an example he singled out Cambridgeshire, which has been given less
than #28m, including the controversial decision to purchase the
Churchill Papers for #13m, which meant #42 per person was spent in the
area per head of population. In the county next door, Bedfordshire,
grants totalled #44,000, working out at only 10p per head.
The news that Strathclyde is getting only #3.15p per head of
population was greeted with anger by Councillor Bill Perry, the convener
of Strathclyde Regional Council. ''It breaks my heart,'' he said.
Mr Perry said he had spent the past year trying to encourage community
groups in the region to come up with projects that could be submitted
for consideration for grants.
He said: ''I think it is disgraceful, when I'm trying to encourage
these groups to come forward, that #3.15p is the kind of support we are
getting from the decision-makers.''

BBC Radio Scotland's listening figures, in terms of hours spent tuned
in by every listener, are the highest for two years.
The listening figures for the third quarter, released in yesterday's
Rajar report, also show that the station's share -- the number of people
who listen across the week multiplied by the number of hours they listen
-- has gone up from 8.1 to 8.6 and people are now tuning in for 7.1
hours a week, compared to 6.3 for the same period last year.
Early indications for Radio Scotland's Saturday afternoon audience
share show an increase of 60% on last year's third quarter, although the
full picture will not be known until early next year when the fourth
quarter results are available.
Mr James Boyle, BBC Scotland's head of radio, said: ''We are delighted
to see such positive trends for Radio Scotland in the latest Rajar
figures, they are all the more remarkable considering the station's
reach at this time of year has taken the traditional summer dip.''

A DOCTOR was called to a court yesterday after a mother, accused of
abandoning her new-born baby twice collapsed while being questioned by a
sheriff.
The 20-year-old from Ullapool admitted the offence on June 19 and,
after she recovered, sentence on her was deferred for background
reports.
Fiscal David Hingston told Dingwall Sheriff Court how, after giving
birth alone in the early hours in the bathroom of the family home, she
wrapped the infant in a towel and put him over the garden wall.
The baby was found very cold but alive at lunchtime by a neighbour as
he put out garden rubbish.
In a letter to the court the woman told of her panic and confusion.
She said: ''Once I discovered I was pregnant I didn't know what to do.
I wanted to tell someone but I didn't know who. I was scared and
confused.
''I thought about it constantly but time just ran out. Once I gave
birth I just panicked.
''Afterwards I went back into the house and lay down but never fell
asleep. Things were going round in my head like what to do and who to
tell.''
She claimed she knew the baby would be found and taken care of.
She said: ''I feel ashamed at what I did and still do. I wish I'd told
someone and I think things would have been better. My friends and family
are standing by me and giving me a lot of support which has helped.
''What I have done I will have to live with for the rest of my life.''
She added that she now planned to take care of her baby and try and be
a good mother.
Mr Hingston said the woman had not known enough to tie off the
umbilical cord which could have resulted in the baby bleeding to death.
Police investigating the abandonment found the mother in her bed
bleeding badly.
She collapsed yesterday as Sheriff James Fraser asked why she had
failed to appear for an earlier court appearance. The sheriff also
rebuked her for apparently smiling in the dock.
After she collapsed for the second time, the sheriff ordered that a
doctor be summoned. He arrived and took the young woman away for
treatment.

FIGHTING broke out in the Court of Appeal in London yesterday after a
man jailed for life for murdering his wife lost his appeal against his
murder conviction.
Three judges ruled that hospital technician Eddie Gilfoyle, 33, found
guilty of killing his heavily pregnant wife by faking her suicide, must
stay in prison.
Mrs Paula Gilfoyle, 32, who had been expecting a baby in two weeks,
was found hanged in the garage of her home in Upton, Wirral, Merseyside,
in June 1992. Her husband was jailed for her murder at Liverpool Crown
Court in July 1993.
As the three appeal judges gave their decision yesterday, Mrs
Gilfoyle's sister, Mrs Susan Dubost, who had given evidence at the
appeal, closed her eyes, sighed heavily, and wept.
Falkland veteran Gilfoyle shook his head and glanced at his relatives,
who started shouting and scuffling with Mrs Gilfoyle's family.
Their screams of ''still innocent'', ''lying bastard'', and ''let's
have the truth'' followed the judges out of court.
Lord Justice Beldam, sitting with Mr Justice Scott Baker and Mr
Justice Hidden, had ruled that fresh evidence, which cast doubt on the
time of death, would have been unlikely to have affected the jury's
unanimous verdict.
They added: ''Nor are we persuaded that it was of such weight that the
verdict should be regarded as unsafe and unsatisfactory.''
Mr Michael Mansfield, QC, for Gilfoyle, claimed that the evidence of
Mrs Maureen Piper would have seriously undermined the Crown's case if
called at the trial.
Mrs Piper told the appeal judges that she ''definitely'' saw Mrs
Gilfoyle at Moreton post office, near her home, between 12.40 and 12.45
on the Thursday she died.
However, cross-examined by Mr Rodney Klevan QC, for the Crown, she
said that she was ''not certain'' it was the day of her death.
Mrs Dubost said that she was at the post office at the time and on the
day Mrs Piper had given, but she had not seen her sister or Mrs Piper.
The judges said that Mrs Piper's confession that she might have been
mistaken did not mean her evidence was of little weight. It could as
well be the hallmark of a candid and reliable witness as of a doubtful
one.
However, the fact that Mrs Piper regularly went to the post office on
a Thursday and could have seen Mrs Gilfoyle the week before, wearing the
clothes she described -- flowery dungarees, quite unsuitable for the
rainy weather on the day of her death -- did significantly detract from
the weight to be given to her evidence.
The judges recounted that Gilfoyle had started an affair the summer
before his wife became pregnant. The woman broke off the relationship
when she learned of the pregnancy.
In an effort to resume the affair, Gilfoyle showed her a letter,
undoubtedly written by his wife, which said that he was not the father
of her child.
This letter, the contents of which were untrue -- Gilfoyle was proved
by DNA testing to be the father -- preceded three notes, also written by
Mrs Gilfoyle, in which she expressed an intention to take her own life.
One of these notes was produced by Gilfoyle on the day his wife was
found dead.
Lord Justice Beldan said that the notes were ''irreconcilable'' with
Mrs Gilfoyle outward demeanour and behaviour.
She appeared exuberant, happy and looking forward to the birth. She
shared her happiness with family and friends, showing them the baby
clothes she had bought, and attended all her ante-natal appointments
except the one on the day of her death.
Three of Mrs Gilfoyle's friends, amazed by her apparent suicide, told
the police that she had mentioned two months before that Gilfoyle was
doing a suicide course at work.
Mrs Gilfoyle said he asked her what she would put in a suicide note
and told her to write down that she had been having an affair, the baby
was not his, and she could not live with the guilt any longer.
Mrs Gilfoyle also said that Gilfoyle took her into the garage and
showed her how to put a rope up.
The judge said that these statements were kept from the jury as
''hearsay'' evidence. He expressed the hope that the law would be
clarified in this respect.
* Merseyside Police said yesterday that an investigation by Detective
Superintendent Graham Gooch of Lancashire CID was carried out under the
supervision of the Police Complaints Authority after complaints by
Gilfoyle's family about the circumstances leading to the original
conviction.
A spokesman added: ''As a result of that investigation Merseyside
Police have now submitted a report to the Police Complaints Authority
for their consideration.''

<HEADLINE>Follow my lead, Forsyth tells private owners of crofting land</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975782179</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth called on private landowners to
follow his lead and transfer ownership of land to crofting community
trusts.
But he said he was ''no Bolshevik'' and insisted there would be no
legislation to force absentee landlords to sell up.
''I am not in the business of taking people's land away from them. But
I am the biggest landowner in Scotland and I am setting an example which
I hope other private landowners will follow.
''I am happy to talk to them about how it can be achieved. But just
like no crofting communities will be forced to take up this offer, I
don't believe in coercing private landowners to hand over their land.''
Mr Forsyth was in Inverness on his way to the Royal National Mod in
Golspie and met new Crofters Commission chairman Iain MacAskill before
officially announcing his plan to transfer ownership of 95 estates,
totalling 250,000 acres of land, to community ownership.
Mr MacAskill greeted the announcement with guarded optimism. He said:
''This gives crofting communities a chance to take control of their own
destiny. But being the cautious creatures crofters are, it will be done
at their own pace.''
Mr Forsyth said a consultation paper would be released in the new
year, and he added: ''I am determined to find ways of devolving power
downwards and this is one example.''
However, communities interested in forming a trust to take over their
land and the running of their affairs will not get the land for nothing.
Mr Forsyth confirmed it was not a land give-away. He explained: ''I
have to look after the interests of the taxpayer as well as the crofter.
''But this is not a money-raising exercise. It is intended to create a
freedom of choice and release the innovation and energy of communities,
which will create new employment and wealth.''
The Scottish Office receives #250,000 in annual rent from its tenant
crofters. The initiative is intended to inspire groups to get together
and take ownership of their land. It will not affect the individual's
right to buy nor will it affect current grant aid schemes.
The role model which has helped prompt the move is the Assynt Crofters
Trust, where the community got together to buy 9000 acres of land from
their foreign landlord three years ago.
Mr Forsyth met the trust's vice-chairman, Mr Bill Ritchie, in
Inverness, before travelling to the north-west to fly over the trust's
dozen townships. He then met crofters and other members of the trust, in
the community of Stoer.

A SPARSELY attended meeting of the Scottish Constitutional Convention
nevertheless gave a rousing endorsement yesterday to its long-awaited
blueprint for a devolved Scottish parliament.
There was prolonged applause after Convention co-chairman Lord Ewing
of Kirkford won unanimous approval for the 16-page document, Key
Proposals for a Scottish Parliament, published earlier this week.
However, just 15 Labour MPs and two Liberal Democrats were counted in
the debating chamber of New Parliament House -- the old Royal High
School -- in Edinburgh, along with representatives from the trades
unions, the churches and other Scottish groups. About a dozen members of
the public watched from the gallery.
There was no sign of such Westminster heavyweights as Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown, Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook or new
Labour Chief Whip Donald Dewar.
Liberal Democrat Defence spokesman Menzies Campbell put in a brief
appearance and then left to attend the Dunhill Cup at St Andrews. Party
headquarters in Edinburgh said it was a constituency engagement. Golf
was a major industry in North-East Fife, so it was appropriate the local
MP should be there.
Many of those involved insisted the sense of occasion would be greater
when the proposals were presented to the Scottish people at ''a major
civic and cultural event'' next month on St Andrews Day in the Assembly
Hall of the Church of Scotland.
Neither the SNP or the Tories have taken part in drawing up the
proposals for a Scottish parliament.
The Scottish Nationalists -- whom Labour leader George Robertson had
earlier attacked as ''the serial whingers of Scottish politics'' -- were
quick to capitalise on the poor attendance.
Nationalist leader Alex Salmond said: ''Having taken six-and-a-half
years to come up with a watered-down scheme, the Convention has bored
everyone stiff with devolution including, so it would seem, even their
own MPs.''
Scottish Tory Party deputy chairwoman Annabel Goldie said the lack of
excitement over the endorsement of the proposals highlighted the
indifference with which most Scots viewed constitutional change.
A concerted campaign by the Convention is now planned to explain the
proposals for the 129-seat parliament to the Scottish people and to win
their support for them.
Commenting on the lack of young people at the meeting, one speaker
representing the arts suggested a Scottish pop group like Runrig or folk
musicians Capercaillie should be asked to write an anthem for the new
Scotland.
This could help to convey ''the thrilling message'' of what was being
proposed to a much wide audience than the 50 or 60 people attending in
New Parliament House yesterday, said Mr Eric Robinson of the Scottish
Arts Forum.
Earlier, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson told the
convention: ''We must now build a real momentum for our plan and inspire
the people with what it can do for their lives and jobs and schools and
hospitals. Now is the time to spell out what can and should be done to
create that economic and cultural climate which will give Scotland and
its people the edge for the next century,'' he said.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace issued a challenge to the
SNP, asking whether it would ''back us or block us'' and he demanded to
know if the Tories would seek to abolish the Parliament or would try to
make it work in the interests of all Scotland.
A number of women speakers, including Jane Mackay of the STUC,
emphasised the importance of achieving equal representation for men and
women in the new parliament.
Canon Kenyon Wright, who chairs the Convention's executive committee,
said the Convention had kept its promise to put the interests of the
people before those of any party or section.
''We have kept faith with the people. We will keep faith until this
place where we now sit fulfils its destiny and speaks for a new
Scotland.''

Wasted journey by Tory?
VITRIOL continues to be poured on poor old Alan Howarth, the former
right-wing Tory MP and Minister who defected to Labour a couple of weeks
ago.
His carefully stage-managed entrance to the Commons on Monday masked a
problem for the MP, who is sitting on a fat majority of almost 23,000 in
his Stratford-upon-Avon constituency.
A gentle inquiry to a senior Tory MP revealed just how much Mr Howarth
is reviled among the ranks of his former colleagues.
What, I wondered, did his former friends among Conservative MPs think
about what he had done? ''The matter doesn't arise,'' came the reply.
''He never had any.''
Worse news is to follow. Mr Howarth is hoping to stand as a Labour
candidate at the next election, and wants to find a friendly seat.
However, the word in the party is that Mr Howarth will struggle.
One Scottish Labour back bencher said that Mr Howarth would have to go
through the party selection machine and that he doubted whether any
constituency would touch him with a barge-pole. ''Frankly, I think he's
finished,'' he said.
French off menu
OVER to those awfully nice Liberal Democrats, who are urging the
Commons to say, as their press release put it, Non, non, non to French
products. They want an end to all purchases and sales of products from
over the water in the bars and restaurants as a protest against nuclear
testing.
The move has come in a motion put down by the Lib Dems' Environment
spokesman Matthew Taylor, who said: ''Thousands of British people are
angry about French nuclear tests. It is time MPs said no to Brie, no to
Camembert, and no to champagne in the House of Commons.''
He added: ''Consumer boycotts are already visible in British
restaurants and supermarkets. Politicians now must take a lead,
registering their outrage.''
Chances are, however, that the motion will be ignored.
Bad language
WHILE we are on the subject of the Liberal Democrats, Sir David Steel
is wondering if Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth will make it his
policy to include a question on the use of Scots in the next Census in
2001 on the same basis as the existing question on Gaelic.
If the question is confusing, the answer is more so. It appears that
the General Register Office for Scotland, together with the Census
Office for England and Wales, and the Office of Population Censuses and
Surveys, has started to consult on census information about their needs
for the next Census.
A number of letters have been received expressing support for a
question on the Scots language and needs also have been expressed for
information about various other languages and other topics.
The gobbledygook goes on. ''The Census Offices and users will consider
whether these requirements can be met by a set of simple questions
without the census form imposing an undue burden on the public. For each
topic a preliminary assessment will be made on whether the Census is the
most appropriate means of collecting the required information.
''Questions for which there is likely to be a good case will be tested
to see if the public find them acceptable and can provide answers of a
quality adequate to meet users' needs. Business cases for such questions
and previously proven questions will then be considered.''
Never mind Scots or Gaelic -- what happened to plain English?
Shot of humour
AMID the controversy over the dreaded drug Temazepam and the desire of
some addicts to mix it with alcohol or other substances, comes a little
gem from the House of Lords exchanges on the matter.
Lord Campbell of Croy to Baroness Cumberlege: ''Is my noble friend
aware that one doctor said of this dangerous mixture: 'It makes you feel
fearless, it disinhibits violence and it diminishes anxiety. Your brain
no longer functions and you do foolish things' Should there not in
future be compulsory testing for this drug of those attending party
conferences?''
The Baroness: ''My Lords, I think some of us on the Front Bench could
do with a shot of Temazepam occasionally.''

<HEADLINE>Rise in married couple's allowance could be on the way with 1p cut in income tax. Clarke set for giveaway Budget</HEADLINE>

THE Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, yesterday settled
the main items in his ''Budget for the family'' at an all-day meeting
with Treasury colleagues and officials.
Mr Clarke is believed to have cleared the decks for a bigger
''giveaway'' Budget than many observers expected.
As much as #5bn or #6bn in tax cuts could be coming the voters' way.
A 1p in the pound cut in the standard rate of income tax to 24p could
be buttressed by increasing the married couples' allowance, responding
to Tory MPs' calls to do more for them, and raising the starting point
for the higher tax rate of 40p, which is now paid by over two million
people, many of them thought to be disillusioned former Conservative
supporters.
The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Mr William Waldegrave, reported
on his progress in obtaining cuts of over #3bn in the spending for next
year initially proposed by departmental Ministers.
Also in attendance were Financial Secretary Michael Jack,
Paymaster-General David Heathcoat-Amory, Economic Secretary Mrs Angela
Knight, Treasury Permanent Secretary Sir Terence Burns, and the
Chancellor's chief economic adviser Alan Budd.
Mr Clarke also received reports on the prospects for introducing much
more private- sector finance into public capital projects which he hopes
will enable him to save over #2bn next year.
The expected sale of the Housing Corporations pre-1988 loan book could
raise about #1bn. Mr Clarke is likely to cut the contingency reserve --
money kept to cover unforeseen emergencies -- and use the saving for
further tax cuts which include increasing the current #154,000 threshold
for inheritance tax which the Prime Minister has promised to eventually
abolish.
Over the next 10 days, there could be ''blood on the floor'' meetings
in the EDX Cabinet Committee where spending ministers will be pressured
to accept further cuts in their budgets which they have so far been
resisting.
The figures presented to the Chancellor are believed to have shown
problems in carrying out his stragegy with public borrowing still higher
than he forecast in the last budget and revenue from sources like income
tax and VAT coming in sluggishly.
Allied to consumer caution in the High Street shops and the failure to
do more than slow the inexorable rise in the #90bn social security
budget, it is not the best background against which to present a major
tax-cutting Budget.
Figures earlier this week added to the Chancellor's problems showing
that, for the first time since July 1992, retail sales in September were
below their levels of the year earlier.
If he goes ahead, Labour is likely to point to the high level of
Government borrowing and accuse the Chancellor of cutting taxes for
purely electoral reasons.
Mr Clarke has been under heavy pressure from Tory MPs and the party's
grassroots membership to restore his cut in mortgage tax relief.
However, if Mr Major plans to stick to his apparent intention of
delaying the next election until the last minute in April 1997, the
Chancellor has to avoid decisions which could see the economy worsening
during the latter part of next year and the early part of election year.
If, however, the Budget is as generous as the Treasury team's
desperate efforts to find savings in public spending indicate, it could
signal that Mr Major has decided to cut and run next year, soon after
the tax cuts come into effect.

THE rise of Labour's most famous ''spin doctor,'' Mr Peter Mandelson,
continues with promotion to a key job under deputy leader John Prescott.
Mr Mandelson, who as director of communications from 1985 to 1990
played a leading part in transforming Labour's image from a ''Red Flag''
to a ''Red Rose'' party is to join Mr Prescott's Commons team in
shadowing Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine's department.
However, more importantly, he will act as the deputy leader's
assistant, planning the party's attack on key Tory seats at the next
election.
The MP, 42 today, moves from the Whips' office to a job where he may
need as much skill to keep on terms with Mr Prescott as to develop the
Party's campaigning strategy.
Mr Mandelson, who has represented Hartlepool since the 1992 election,
still is regarded with suspicion by many Labour MPs but is one of Mr
Blair's closest confidants.
He is probably Britain's most famous spin doctor -- one who interprets
the news to journalists in a way favourable to his party or government
-- since Sir Bernard Ingham retired as Mrs Thatcher's press secretary at
Downing Street.
Mr Mandelson's Commons job will be the most junior one in Mr
Prescott's four-man team, concentrating on Civil Service matters.
Mr Prescott's deputy will be Mr Derek Foster, formerly the Opposition
Chief Whip, whose main role as Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster is to prepare for Labour's transition from Opposition to
Government.
The other member of the team is Mr Dick Caborne, MP for Sheffield
Central and the respected chairman of the all-party Select Committee on
trade and industry, who will concentrate on competition and deregulation
matters.
MPs on both sides will be watching intently to see how Mr Mandelson
hits it off with the sometimes touchy Mr Prescott, who has resented
being excluded from some of Mr Blair's private planning meetings.
Mr Blair will name the party's junior spokesman in the Commons on
Monday and is going for a ''new look'' which the Shadow Cabinet
elections fail to produce in the top jobs.
There should be a record number of 14 women Front Benchers, four from
the 1992 intake.

A RIGHT-wing challenge to Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the
influential 1922 committee of Tory back benchers is to be mounted. The
68-year old MP for Shipley is expected to be opposed by Mr Bob Dunn, a
fundamentalist right-winger and former Minister.
Mr Major would almost certainly prefer Sir Marcus to stay in post as
the main channel of communications between the rank-and-file MPs and
Downing Street.
The challenge partly stems from right-wing anger when Sir Marcus
transmitted the message from Mr Major that further rebellions on Europe
would result in the calling of an immediate General Election.

VETERAN MP Bob Hughes this weekend will be urged to put the
disappointment of failure to be selected for Aberdeen Central behind him
and help Labour try to win the three Aberdeen constituencies.
After 25 years as MP for Aberdeen North and following boundary
changes, Mr Hughes, 63, was defeated by a single vote by former Aberdeen
South MP Frank Doran for the candidacy of Central, expected to be a safe
Labour seat.
He was clearly bitterly disappointed at the defeat and has been
unavailable for comment since the decision of the constituency party was
announced.
He is understood to be discussing his future with his family but this
weekend Hughes supporters will urge him to contest the new Aberdeen
North seat.
It is Aberdeen North which Mr Hughes has held since 1970 and he
currently has a majority of 9237, but under the boundary changes Labour
is far less assured of victory.
According to Hughes supporter Mrs Christina Woods, that is why Mr
Hughes should be fighting it.
''He will have taken a terrible knock,'' she said, ''but Bob will
bounce back.'' She said that his supporters would leave him for 24 hours
to discuss the future with his family.
''We will then be on the phone to him urging him to stand in Aberdeen
North where his 25 years of experience will be valuable.''
Mr Andrew Benzie, Labour's constituency secretary for Aberdeen North,
said that nominations had just opened and they would be delighted if Mr
Hughes threw his hat into the ring.
As the sitting MP, he automatically had the right to be included on
the short leet, but as it was a new seat he did not have the automatic
right to the nomination.
An all-women short leet is been drawn up for Aberdeen South.
Mr Doran won Aberdeen South from Conservative Gerry Malone in 1987,
but lost to Raymond Robertson, now a Scottish Office Minister, in 1992.
Since losing the seat, Mr Doran, 46, has remained active in politics.
After his victory, Mr Doran said: ''I am obviously delighted at the
result and am looking forward to fighting the election which cannot come
soon enough as far as I am concerned.
He denied it was a victory for new Labour over old Labour and said he
was a long- standing friend of Mr Hughes and their relationship had been
unaffected by the contest.
''We have been good friends and will remain good friends,'' he said.

SCOTTISH Tory leaders yesterday attacked the running costs of the
devolved parliament proposed by the Convention.
Party deputy chairwoman Annabel Goldie claimed the total cost of the
parliament would easily run into tens of millions each year.
She said: ''This massive expense would have to be met from our
Westminster block grant. Monies currently spent on healthcare, education
and other key services would go to fund a Scottish parliament.''
Meanwhile, Tory statesman Viscount Whitelaw yesterday warned of the
dangers of Scotland splitting away from the United Kingdom. The former
deputy Prime Minister told members of Edinburgh University's
Conservative and Unionist Association that he did not believe the split
would ever occur. Delivering the annual presidential address, he said a
separate Scottish parliament, if it ever did get off the ground, would
be an ''extremely expensive proposition.''

GARDENING
The monks of Melrose Abbey weren't involved after all, but when Liz
Taylor traces the roots of her apple tree, the story is equally
fascinating
THE most impressive thing growing in my garden is an old apple tree,
moss-covered and twisted into a strange shape, like an arthritic old
person.
It only fruits heavily every second year but each spring it creates a
wonder of blossom, as if it is saying ''I'm trying''. The apples it
yields are green-skinned but delicious, with soft spongy flesh and a
very sweet taste. Unfortunately they do not keep long so you have to eat
them when they are ripe, which is in September and early October. They
make magnificent wine-coloured jelly and one year my son and I managed
to produce a heady apple wine that induced giggles in people who are
normally most strait-laced.
An old man in his eighties, who lived in my cottage as a child, met me
one day and asked: ''How's the apple tree in the garden?''
When I told him it was still healthy and producing fruit, he said that
it had been an old tree when he was a boy and it produced the
best-tasting apples in our village, which is, or was before the builders
moved in, a village of orchards. His parents had told him it was a
descendant of trees brought to Melrose by the monks who built the abbey.
The monks' apples were called Melrose Whites.
I dined out on this story, telling it to any visitors who admired the
old tree. However, seeing an advertisement for the Fruit-naming Service
run by the Royal Horticultural Society at Wisley, I decided to have it
properly authenticated. Did I really own a Melrose White, I wanted to
know?
This has been a good year to check up on the tree's credentials
because in my time with it, 23 years, it has never produced such a
bumper crop. The blossom was not too abundant but the apples are bigger
than tennis balls and so numerous that they weigh down the branches.
The Fruit-naming Service at Wisley sent me a leaflet telling me to
select three unbruised apples, with a leaf and a piece of twig. Each
apple was to be numbered with ballpoint pen on its skin -- stick on
labels were not to be used -- and details were to be provided of the
tree, its age, its appearance, its habit, and the soil type of the
garden. The apples were to be packed in a solid box, protected from
bruising by granules or shredded newspaper, and care had to be taken
that the box did not smell of anything. I must not use a box that had
contained scented soap, for example.
I lovingly packed three fine apples, wrote out the necessary details
and added I'd been told that the tree was a Melrose White. Then I sent
the box off, with a stamped addressed envelope for the specialist
verdict and a cheque for #10.
A few days later I received a reply. Alas, I do not have a Melrose
White. Apparently these have a reddish blush on the skin, which my
apples do not.
In the opinion of the fruit-naming specialist, Mr J F T Arbury, I have
an Emneth Early which received an Award of Merit from the Royal
Horticultural Society in 1899, and was raised by William Lynn at Emneth
in Cambridgeshire from a cross between Lord Grosvenor and Keswick Codlin
apples.
The book Apples, by John Bultitude, says that the Emneth Early is a
cooker but my apples are definitely sweet dessert apples and never need
sugar added to them when stewed. When I told Mr Arbury this he explained
it away by saying that an old apple can sometimes become sweeter over
the years, like an old tune, I expect.
So I've been spinning a romantic yarn about my tree. It doesn't sound
quite the same to say ''Look at my Emneth Early apple tree . . . '' as
it does to boast about a tree that arrived with mediaeval monks, but the
apples are still delicious and the crop so abundant that I think I'll
have another go at that apple wine.
Further Information
* THE Fruit-naming Service, at the Royal Horticultural Society's
Garden, Wisley, Woking, Surrey GU23 6QB, will try to identify apples,
pears, plums, and other soft fruit. Mr Arbury identified more than 360
different fruits last year and the total for this year is already above
that.
The most unusual apple that he has seen recently came from Midlothian
and he thinks it is a descendant of an old French apple -- maybe it came
over with Mary Queen of Scots.
Members of the Royal Horticultural Society pay a fee of #6 for the
service and non-members #10, but Mr Arbury is so busy at the moment that
he hopes people will hold back until next year before deluging him with
fruit. October is the busiest month for him because it is then that most
apples ripen.

A BID to ban boxing looks a strong possibility for the next session of
Parliament beginning next month A considerable number of Opposition MPs
are believed to be considering it if they win a high place in the ballot
for Private Members' Bills conducted after the start of a new
parliamentary year.
Labour's deputy leader John Prescott said yesterday he would be
prepared to support a Bill banning the sport, following the death of Jim
Murray last weekend.
He said in a BBC TV interview ''Frankly, I think the evidence is
accumulating in such a way that if a private Bill presented itself to
the Commons to ban boxing I would vote for it.''
The snag for opponents is that only the first four or five Bills in
the list have any prospect of becoming law because of the time availbale
for discussion unless there is no opposition.
If a Bill is highly controversial, as a banning Bill would be,
opponents often have recourse to tactical ploys to prevent it getting
through.
Murray, 25, died in hospital after collapsing on Friday of last week
during a British bantamweight title fight in Glasgow.
Sports Minister Iain Sproat ruled out a ban on boxing, which he called
''a terrific sport'', during Commons exchanges last Monday.
In view of the fierce resistance a Bill to ban boxing would meet,
another possibility is that any MPs lucky in the ballot might seek to
write into law various safety precautions to render the sport less
dangerous.
Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, is campaigning for fundamental
reforms which should include a ban on punches to the head.
Mr Sam Galbraith, Labour MP for Sttrathkelvin and Bearsden, has called
for an urgent programme of research into brain damage caused in
professional boxing.

MY LAST GOOD RECORD
Stephen Pastel, singer with the Pastels
* I'VE got three best records but all by the same band Galaxie 500.
The first one is Aurora which came out in 1988, then On Fire in 1989 and
This Is Our Music, which came out in 1990. They're magical sounding
records, quite simplistic in a way as nothing much happens. The singer
has this real falsetto voice, which I think is quite rare and charming,
while the bass and drums are jazz-like, in that they're loose and
spacey. But I don't like intellectualising why I like them so it's best
to say I like them because I put the records on at night, sit with the
curtains open and look out the window.

JAZZ
THERE are times when you begin to believe that memory does play tricks
as you recall concerts or club dates and are overcome with nostalgia for
musicians who have gone and for music which may not have stood the test
of time.
Then out comes an album which confirms for you that on some of those
long ago and faraway nights things were exactly as good as you have
remembered them.
A batch of new CDs from the Black Lion label which have been issued
recently contained one which featured the Alex Welsh Band with the
American trumpet star Ruby Braff, and I recalled two nights at the
Manchester Sports' Guild when I heard the British group hold their own
with that little, big man from Boston who demands so much from his
backing musicians.
The band put together by Alex Welsh, or, rather, the two bands the
Edinburgh born trumpeter put together over the decades was at one stage
the best of its kind in the world. The veteran tenor saxophonist Bud
Freeman, who toured frequently with Welsh, told me once: ''There is not
another band working today either here or in the States as good as this
one is . . .''
It was an accolade which Welsh and his musicians deserved. They had
earned it over the years touring with most of the American Dixieland and
mainstream stars of the sixties and early seventies.
The Welsh bands were rather special. If pushed I would always say the
first one with Archie Semple and Roy Crimmins making up the front line
with Alex was my favourite.
The problem with Alex and his fellow musicians was that they didn't
just want to play the music of the Chicagoans they wanted to copy their
hard-drinking lives as well.
In 1965 the shy, sensitive Semple died from alcoholism just a few
years before his idol was vanquished by the same illness . . .
In 1978 the drummer Lennie Hastings also died. Alex himself went in
l982 and the pianist Fred Hunt four years later. The one survivor from
that early band is trombonist Crimmins.
But the band left an indelible mark on the British scene -- and
further afield. So did the ''second band'' which had Roy Williams on
trombone and Johnny Barnes on baritone and clarinet and, sometimes Al
Gay on tenor saxophone too.
It's the second band with Braff and it's the same band on another
Black Lion CD devoted just to Alex. For the earlier group you may have
to search a little harder to find their music though there was one
re-issue album which placed together two of their most famous early
recordings, Dixieland to Duke and The Melrose Folio.
There was one occasion I shall never forget when I stood in the wings
at the Odeon in Glasgow with Alex to watch Louis Armstrong and his All
Stars. It was a special time for Alex because his band had been chosen
to open the shows for Armstrong in his nationwide tour.
It was an insight into how the great man worked. Before the curtain
went up he was chewing out one of the men in the band because of some
mistake he had made earlier. Then the spotlight was on and Armstrong the
showman was back smiling at his beloved audience.
''Look at that,'' said Alex, ''the perfect pro. Anything happening
backstage is left there when he has to play.''
Then ten minutes later a very unusual thing happened when Louis
suddenly departed from the normal programme, the one he had set in his
mind for every show. He mopped his brow, went to the microphone and
announced that he was going to play When You're Smiling for Alex's
mother who was there that night.
Alex, standing there beside me, shed a tear or two during that song.
And knowing him, I believe that may have been his proudest moment.

THE European Commission ruled yesterday that Britain had not breached
EU environment laws over the development of the M77 in Scotland.
EC officials in Brussels said they had decided not to take legal
action over the failure to hold an environmental impact assessment as
required by European law into the development of the motorway.
The decision was greeted with dismay by M77 protesters. Feelings have
been running high since work started to drive the M77 extension through
Pollok Estate in the south of Glasgow.
Last month the former Industry Minister, Mr Allan Stewart, was fined
#200 after admitting breach of the peace in a confrontation with
protesters.
Last night a spokesman for Friends of the Earth (Scotland) said the
ruling was very disappointing. ''It is a tragedy for the people who live
along the route because they are suffering the consequences of there
being no environmental impact assessment.
''It is a victory for old thinking.''
A spokesman for Glasgow for People said they too found the ruling
disappointing.
Mr David Spavin, a transport consultant who produced a report into the
alternatives to the M77 for Glasgow for People, said he found it
unbelievable.
The Commission also ruled that another major road project, the
development of the Newbury by-pass in Berkshire, had not breached EU
environment laws.
More than three years ago the Commission dropped legal proceedings in
five major planning controversies in Britain, including the M3 extension
at Twyford Down in Hampshire, despite lack of the environment
assessment.
On that occasion the then Environment Secretary, Michael Howard,
convinced Brussels that comprehensive inquiries equivalent to the
requirements of the law had been carried out.
Now, the Commission has said the two latest cases are a national
matter, because the EU legislation only applies after July 3, 1988.
A 10-year-old directive provides for environmental impact assessments
meeting Commission standards ''for public and private projects likely to
have significant effects on the environment''.
But the European Court of Justice decreed in August that such
assessments are only required for projects where procedures for consent
were started after July 3 1988, the latest permitted date for EU
governments to transpose the directive into national law.
''That means the directive does not apply to these two projects,''
said a Commission spokesman yesterday.

Michael Fry looks on as the Prine sets out his stall with a radial
manifesto designed to restore full rights to his father's dynasty
DISPATCH FROM THE FRONT
EDINBURGH, October 21 -- Prince Charles Edward Stuart has declared the
Union of 1707 between Scotland and England invalid, in a manifesto of
his political aims issued from Holyrood.
Acting as Regent of Scotland on behalf of his father, James VIII, he
states that the ''pretended Union of the two nations'' cannot possibly
be ratified. This is in line with the Jacobite contention that no Act of
Parliament passed since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 has received the
royal assent.
The manifesto does not otherwise revoke all the laws of the last
half-century. On the contrary, it undertakes that James VIII will
confirm them ''insofar as in a free and legal Parliament they shall be
approved''. This can be taken to mean a Parliament freshly elected after
the restoration of a Stewart monarchy.
But the manifesto puts the Treaty of Union into a special category.
The prince claims that James VIII ''has had repeated remonstrances
against it from each kingdom'', and that in 1707 its main point ''was
the exclusion of the Royal family from their undoubted right to the
Crown''. For this purpose, ''the grossest corruptions were openly used''
to bring the Union about.
Still, the prince stops short of declaring Scotland fully independent
again. Instead he promises that his father will consent to ''whatever
may be hereafter devised for the joint benefit of both nations'', again
presumably once new Parliaments have been summoned. The strict
constitutional position is that no legislation need be passed to
re-create the Parliament in Edinburgh. The last was only prorogued
rather than dissolved before the Union came into force, and can simply
be recalled.
The prince guarantees the status of the Churches of Scotland, England,
and Ireland. If they or their clergy require further assistances, he
pledges that James VIII will ''pass any law that his Parliament shall
see necessary for that purpose''. Though the Stuarts are Roman
Catholics, the manifesto says that the Protestant majority of their
subjects need have no fear. The aim is ''not to impose upon any a
religion which they dislike, but to secure them all in the enjoyment of
those which are respectively, at present, established among them''.
The prince also promises tax cuts. He sets out his father's worries
about the size of the national debt, ''a heavy load'' which has been
contracted under ''an unlawful Government''. But since the debt is ''for
the greatest part due to those very subjects whom he promises to
protect, cherish and defend, he is resolved to take the advice of his
Parliament concerning it''.
First reactions in Edinburgh to the manifesto are that it raises as
many questions as it answers. Even the prince's military commander, Lord
George Murray, believes he has acted unconstitutionally in decreeing the
dissolution of the Union before recall of the Scottish Parliament,
because the same Parliament had approved it by due process. There is
also concern that he makes no mention of how the restored Stuarts might
propose to solve the main problem for Scotland before 1707, that a
Parliament based in Edinburgh had little effect on the actions of a
Government based in London with the king.
The manifesto makes a direct appeal not only to Scottish, but also to
English opinion. To that extent, it reflects Prince Charles's impatience
to reconquer the whole British Isles. Leaders of the Scots Jacobites
believe, on the other hand, that talk of invading England is premature
at this stage, and that it would be better to consolidate in Scotland
first.
Otherwise the document adopts a markedly liberal tone probably owed to
the man who drafted it, Sir James Steuart of Goodtrees, Midlothian. At
32, he is one of the rising stars of the Scots Bar, with an interest in
the new science of economics. A relation of his describes him as ''a
Jacobite on some Whig principles, but not the whole of them''.
In fact he comes from the heart of the Whig establishment. His father,
also Sir James, was an MP and served as Solicitor-General in 1715-17,
while his mother was a daughter of Lord Stair, Lord President of the
Court of Session. He is a cousin of Archibald Stewart, Lord Provost of
Edinburgh.
Sir James is one of the more impressive recruits to the Jacobite
cause, for which he declared after the Battle of Prestonpans. Educated
at the universities of Edinburgh, Leyden, and Utrecht, he became an
advocate in 1735. He continued to travel on the Continent and was
converted to Jacobitism when he met James VIII in Rome.
On his return home, where his new convictions were still unsuspected,
Sir James turned down the chance to become parliamentary candidate for
the Linlithgow Burghs. He fell out with the Whig administration in
Scotland during an embarrassing dispute over electoral irregularities in
Midlothian at last year's by-election. After being refused the right to
vote, he sued the judge, Lord Arniston, and his son, Robert Dundas, the
Solicitor-General, but lost his case in the Court of Session. This put
an end to his hopes of preferment, and no doubt accounts for his
disaffection from the Government.
Prince Charles, however, is obviously willing to give him the biggest
jobs. For his next one, he will probably go as ambassador to France, in
place of the temporary envoy, George Kelly. Steuart is one of those
known to be insisting that strong French support is vital to the success
of the rebellion. The first of it has already arrived, with the landing
at Montrose and Stonehaven in the last few days of ships from Dunkirk
with artillery and stores. Steuart's brief will be to negotiate more of
the same. If he succeeds, he is already being spoken of as the restored
Stuarts' Prime Minister.

If you worry about the pawls being pushed down by the ratchet, you
must be a mountain biker. Peter Evans wonders at the wealth of detail in
a simple pastime
ONCE upon a time, back in the 1950s and earlier, cycling was thought
of as a relatively sedate form of exercise. Yes, there were a few
''rough stuff'' cyclists who ventured off road, but they were in a
minority, and looked upon as being slightly odd.
Cycling clubs took to the road in touring groups, out for a day's
riding along country lanes, stopping at a pre-arranged cafe for a break
before the journey home again.
In the last decade or so, all that has changed. The arrival of the
all-terrain bicycle (ATB) or mountain bike, as it is more commonly
known, has revolutionised cycling and revived the fortunes of the bike
manufacturers after a downturn in fortunes through the seventies and
early eighties.
To begin with, mountain bikes were bought largely for their poseur
value. They looked good, and for youngsters in particular there was a
lot of street cred to be gained from owning a flash new ATB, perhaps
endowed with 20 or more gears, instead of your average, everyday road
bike.
The bike may never have been subjected to any more rugged terrain than
a bumpy lane or a gravel driveway, but that didn't matter -- the rider
drew admiring glances from envious friends, who in turn all wanted
mountain bikes themselves, and fuelled an explosion in sales.
It spawned a whole new cycling ethos, and mountain biking has now
become an established sport in its own right. The machines have become
commonplace -- not only for off-road use but for commuting in towns and
cities.
Prices for better engineered models are high, and it's not unusual for
people to spend several hundred pounds. Along with the bike goes the
specialist clothing -- helmets, lycra shorts, waterproofs, shoes and all
the rest.
Several magazines cater for enthusiasts, and there is a book, The
Mountain Bike Book, dealing with everything from choosing a bike to
clothing and accessories, tools and maintenance, where to ride and
riding techniques.
An experienced rider himself David Leslie provides detailed guidance
about the bikes and their component parts, illustrated with diagrams and
colour pictures.
It's all quite technical stuff, and although every attempt has been
made to make the text understandable, inevitably it is going to baffle
those with no mechanical know-how.
For instance: ''When the freewheel turns in one direction, the pawls
drive the hub body. When there is no drive, the pawls are pushed down by
the ratchet in the hub body.'' Que?!
Like a lot of things, a book can help you on your way, but the only
real way to learn is to do whatever is being described with help from a
knowledgeable friend. Even then, if you're not careful you can end up
becoming a techno-freak, fiddling with the bike a lot more than actually
riding it, which is, after all, the principal reason for owning it in
the first place.
Once past the technical stuff and into the sections on nutrition, how
to get fit, riding techniques, the text is somewhat less obtuse, and
there's a lot of very helpful information.
For me, this is a book written by an expert for enthusiasts. It's not
for beginners. Mountain bikes are machines, which need looking after,
and if you're really into off-road riding in a serious way, Leslie's the
man to provide the information you need.
For the average rider the book is probably too advanced. It may help
you to understand your bike better, but you could end up with bits all
over the garage floor, not knowing how to put them back together again.

SCOTCHING THE MYTHS
The final sitting of the Scots Parliament was not a dignified affair.
Jim Hewitson reports on an historic gathering
ROLL Up! Roll Up! Get yer ''Stuff the Union'' T-shirts here. Quality
mugs, scarves and rosettes, all with yer offishell ''Ah'm Fur Stayin'
Oot!'' motif . . . Amid all the excitement of the final sitting of the
Scots Parliament which began in October 1706 I can't believe that some
street-corner sharp operator didn't make a killing.
Fact is that if they'd been selling season tickets for this momentous
session of Parliament which lasted four months, the Estates could have
gathered in enough cash to set us on the road to prosperity and enable
us to give England the once-and-for-all swivel finger -- all at one fell
swoop.
Each day of the historic gathering a great, boisterous, jostling crowd
thronged Edinburgh's High Street and perched on every available vantage
point, watching the members come and go and eagerly chewing over every
snippet of information about progress on the Union debate which filtered
out of the Parliament building.
By this stage there was no doubt where the sympathy of the common folk
lay. Opponents of the Union were loudly cheered as they arrived for the
day's business and supporters denounced in a wave of foul and abusives.
Most of the applause was directed at the Duke of Hamilton. Leaving
Parliament every evening for his residence at Holyrood House he was
accompanied by a mob of apprentices and ''excited young people'', who
cheered him as patriot and cursed his principal rival the Duke of
Queensferry, the lord high commissioner.
It was almost inevitable that there would be trouble. One evening the
House sat to an unusually late hour and Hamilton, who was suffering
lameness at the time, had himself carried to the more convenient
lodgings of the Duke of Atholl along the Lawnmarket. He was cheered all
the way but the mob, disappointed that for once their fun had been cut
short, turned their attention, not surprisingly, on the pro-Unionists.
Close by was the dwelling of Sir Patrick Johnston, formerly provost of
the city but now considered by many as a traitor for his support of the
Union. The building was a sturdy one and the provost's house on the
fourth floor, so a shower of stones directed upwards proved more
troublesome for the crowd below than for the beseiged. When the mob
tried to burst in Lady Johnston who was home alone, went to the window
and pleaded for help. An apothecary returned with the 30-strong town
guard who charged the mob, cleared the stairs and took six of the
ringleaders into custody.
By this time, however, a wild contingent from Leith, including a group
of sailors had arrived and the mob temporarily became masters of the
city, roaming around breaking windows and insulting the MPs as they were
driven home. Journalist Daniel Defoe, who had accompanied the
commissioners to Edinburgh, his secret mission to promote the Union, was
one of those who had to dive for cover when -- good reporter that he was
-- he went to the window to view the proceedings. The stone directed at
him missed its target. This uproar continued until 1am when a battalion
of guards from the castle finally calmed the situation.
This was no general uprising however, but a revolt of ''idle boys and
the refuse of the mob'' as can be witnessed by an order issued by the
Privy Council suggesting that masters keep their apprentices, servants
and domestics within doors, and regents and professors should look to
the good order and peaceable behaviour of their pupils.
For most folk there seems to have been a fearful inevitability about
the deliberations of the Scots Parliament.

Concluding his series on less well-know courses, Ron Marshall heads
northwards along the A9, to find ships steaming serenely past the greens
at Perth, views which should be wrapped up and sold at Pitlochry, and
glowing gorse lining the leisured links of magically peaeful Royal
Dornoch
THE seduction of golf in Scotland, willingly abetted by nature,
assumes countless guises . . . the popping of radiant yellow gorse in
May at Royal Dornoch, the maritime grandeur at Royal Aberdeen and Cruden
Bay, champagne air ventilating the Tay valley from heady views above
Pitlochry . . . the list, even for the north of Scotland alone, would be
endless.
For it is that part of the country that completes this whistlestop
golf tour that has stretched from Stranraer and Southerness in the
south, Eyemouth in the east, to the springy linksland of Sutherland.
The choice was again frustrating, and no claims are being made about
any being the best, the most picturesque, or most challenging. A hundred
golf enthusiasts would offer as many different selections. These are
mine, based often on nothing more than personal whim, but sometimes out
of sheer love for the place.
A good starting-off point is the A9, a route that offers inquiring
golfers myriad avenues of satisfying exploration. An hour north of
Glasgow feel free to savour the Gleneagles ambience -- that's about all
you'll achieve. Only an overnight stay within the hotel's grand portals
opens the door to a round on any of the three courses, King's, Queen's,
or Monarch.
Don't fret, though. Auchterarder's course may not have been designed
by Jack Nicklaus but it's side by side with the one that has, the
Monarch, and would provide any standard of player with a sense of
well-being, offering panoramic views. And for elegant quarters look no
farther than the Coll Earn Hotel, with its handsomely spacious bedrooms
and fine wood panelling. The Cairn Lodge, on the road to the course,
also comes highly recommended.
If you're looking for an unconventional course stop off in the Fair
City of Perth and experience the challenge of trying to find the King
James VI Golf Club. Quite straightforward really -- climb the metal
staircase in Tay Street, walk along the railway bridge that crosses the
Tay (don't worry about passing trains to and from Aberdeen. They're at
least five feet away, and there's a metal handrail), descend another
metal stair on to Moncreiffe Island, walk for a couple of hundred yards
past thriving allotments, and the course and clubhouse open up before
you.
John McGill, the club captain, assures me there's only one other
course in the world on an island within city limits, in Perth, Western
Australia, although some sage will no doubt correct us on that.
A couple of years from now the club celebrates its centenary on the
island -- previously it had been in existence for 40 years at the North
Inch, where there's still a municipal course. Apparently King James VI,
one of the game's earliest converts, hit the occasional ball in the
North Inch area, prompting the regal attachment to the club.
A source of pride among the historically minded of the membership is
that their club was among the 23 which contributed to the cost of
manufacture of the British Amateur Championship trophy in 1885.
The city itself is ideally positioned for striking out into
Perthshire's scenic hinterland. Comfort bases in the city include the
Royal George, Salutation, Lovat, and Station hotels, and I see the
fine-value restaurant, Pierre Victoire, is a welcome addition to South
Street.
A rewarding diversion off the A9 begins at Ballinluig, just south of
Pitlochry. Head west through Aberfeldy, and watch for the turn-off to
the right, a mile or so short of the picturesque village of Kenmore, to
Taymouth Castle Golf Club, another in that category begging the
description ''therapeutic''.
Beautiful mountain scenery, broken by the incursion of Loch Tay to the
west, envelops this historic piece of turf. If James VI enjoyed ''the
gowf'' in the early 1600s, then Taymouth Castle had to wait almost 250
years, and 11 monarchs down the line, for its royal imprimatur. Victoria
spent part of her honeymoon in the castle, and even gave some thought to
buying the estate.
She would not, however, have played golf. Only in 1923 was the course
design established by that great golfer and designer James Braid. A
group of businessmen established the castle and course as a first-class
resort, one that included fishing rights in the Tay, bordering the
course to the north and east. (Keith Mackie's informative notes in the
course's Strokesaver booklet tell us that Hitler's Foreign Minister,
Baron von Ribbentrop, was a regular pre-war visitor, pointing out that,
unlike his boss, he could get out of a bunker!)
Post-war the castle was in turn a Civil Defence training establishment
and a school for children of American oilmen, until 1979, since when it
has been largely disused, except for the occasional wedding reception.
The McTaggart family, the estate's current owners, are scattered from
the Bahamas to Islay but Andrew, one of the sons, and his wife run the
estate. Golf is efficiently and courteously organised by Ian Stark.
In passing, it's worth mentioning the brilliant job Duncan Menzies,
owner of the Kenmore Holiday Centre, and his son Robin, a civil
engineer, made in designing their now very popular nine-hole course
beside Loch Tay three years ago. Braid would have been proud of it.
Not Braid but Willie Fernie, the 1883 Open Champion, earns the
plaudits for shaping our next piece of golfing terrain, located in the
''Switzerland of Scotland'' around Pitlochry. High above the holiday
town Fernie laid out an improbable masterpiece among such hilly
conditions.
The climb up the first four holes demands a degree of fitness but the
reward, apart from playing a fine course, is some stunning scenery
looking back down the Tay valley, wedged between pine-clad mountains.
The club's casualty rate in professionals has been frugal, to say the
least. The incumbent, George Hampton, who joined four years ago from
Fortrose and Rosemarkie, is only the third man to occupy the position
since the First World War. His predecessor for 43 years, as kindly and
humble a man as you could wish to meet, was Jimmy Wilson, himself now 83
and still to be seen on the course two or three times a week.
Before him was, by all accounts, another gem of a pro, one John
Murray, to whom the great John Panton, another son of Pitlochry, pays
tribute for his guidance and tutoring when under the wing of Murray as
an assistant professional in the mid-1930s.
George Hampton, himself no mean player (he won the Scottish senior
title two years ago at Dalmahoy), perfectly fits the Pitlochry
identikit, as devised by the club's landlord, Major Sir David Butter.
''It is unlikely that anyone under the age of 50 would be considered
suitable for the post'' ran the wording in the job ad. That meant
someone devoting his time to the members and visitors, not scurrying off
to run coaching courses or play in every pro-am in the country.
Pitlochry Golf Club seems to have landed the ideal man.
Still with the A9 you have two distinct options on reaching Inverness.
Continue north to Dornoch or turn east on the A96 to visit Nairn. Of
course, you can always do both.
Dornoch is one of those magically peaceful little towns, its imposing
cathedral in the capable hands of Jimmy Simpson, last year's captain of
Royal Dornoch Golf Club (and father of the Scottish Secretary of the
Professional Golfers' Association), but better known in ecclesiastical
circles as the Moderator of the General Assembly.
The formal creation of the golf club seems fairly recent, 1877, but
records show that the game was played there in the early 1600s. The
club's most notable sons have been the famous
secretary-greeenkeeper-designer-player John Sutherland, whose working
links with the club spanned more than 50 years from 1883, and the course
architect Donald Ross, Dornoch's head greenkeeper and professional who
rose to prominence after emigrating to the United States.
The current professional, Willie Skinner, has been in the job for
almost 21 years after a successful amateur career. Willie has seen a
succession of stars come to pay homage at Royal Dornoch, one of the
world's finest links courses -- last month's US Masters winner Ben
Crenshaw, Tom Watson, Greg Norman, Nick Faldo, Andy North, and a couple
of years ago Prince Andrew.
''I thought it was a hoax call,'' Willie recalls. ''Somebody calling
himself the prince's detective phoned to see if the prince could play
the following morning. Sure enough he arrived, and asked if I'd like to
join him.''
Andrew (handicap 13) played a nifty game, reports his professional
companion. I forgot to ask Willie if he'd invited his guest upstairs
afterwards to the clubhouse bar. That would have been a right royal
feather in the steward's cap. Or he could have experienced the delights
of a natter at the golf-mad Burghfield House Hotel, former holiday home
of Fleet Street baron Lord Rothermere.
Other Dornoch favourites are the Royal Golf Hotel, literally a few
steps above the first tee, and the Castle Hotel, ancient home of the
Bishops of Caithness and Sutherland. All three hotels are very closely
involved with the town's popular golf week in early September,
supervised by Willie and Crieff doyen John Stark.
Other courses in the area worth a try are at Golspie and Brora, the
latter famous for having as a member the man who twice in one week beat
former US and British Open champion Johnny Miller (at Brora and Dornoch
during Miller's Brigham Young University tour in 1965). His name --
another J Miller, Jimmy this time, one of Scotland's finest amateurs who
rarely ventured south of Inverness in his golfing quests.
I do hope, though, he went as far as Nairn. The condition of this
wonderful links course is always first-class under head greenkeeper Ian
Carson's supervision, the variety of holes demands shot-making of the
highest calibre, and the new clubhouse offers relaxing views over the
Moray Firth.
Recognition of the highest order came last year when the Amateur
Championship was played there, and richer distinction befalls the club
when the biennial match between the top amateurs of the British Isles
and the United States for the Walker Cup is played at Nairn in 1999.
A whole string of excellent courses runs along the Firth, Forres,
Lossiemouth, and Duff House Royal among them, but it is to Cruden Bay we
head next, just about the most easterly point of the Scottish mainland,
south of Peterhead. Non-golfers with the slightest of literary bents may
well put their finger on the area as being the site of Slains Castle,
inspiration of Bram Stoker's Dracula.
Golfers, on the other hand, associate the place with the redoubtable
Eric Brown, who exacted his own retribution on American opponents during
four successive Ryder Cup matches in the 1950s.
Known to the toffs from the south as the Brighton of Aberdeenshire,
Cruden Bay had its share of famous visitors. The retired golf-club
secretary, Ian McPherson, told me that Mrs Colman (of mustard fame) used
to reward her caddie not only with his usual shilling but a kiss as
well, ''much to their embarrassment'' according to the club records.
One valued piece of memorabilia in the secretary's office is the
cheque paid by a group of far-sighted businessmen after the Second World
War to a scrap merchant, who himself had bought the course and remnants
of the hotel, which had fallen into disrepair. The sum -- #2750. Not
quite the bargain the Dutch negotiated with the Canarsee Indians (they
paid 60 guilders' worth of trinkets for Manhattan Island) but to the
locals of Cruden Bay, every bit as enterprising.
From one splendid links course to another farther down the coast,
Royal Aberdeen, often referred to as Balgownie, which sits just north of
the city, at Bridge of Don, on its seaside perch cheek by jowl with
another fine links course, Murcar.
The ''royal'' accolade was granted by Edward VII in 1903, but the club
had been in existence since 1780, making it the sixth oldest in the
world.
Again the advent of the train made a handsome contribution to
developing tourism and sporting activity in the area. TodayHome Counties
enthusiasts can leave Euston on the Night Aberdonian at 10pm, alight at
Arbroath just after 6.30am, get themselves a breakfast, say, at Carlogie
House Hotel on Carnoustie's outskirts, and be on the Championship course
by 8am.
If they have the stamina for 36 holes in a day there are wonderful
courses, too, at Barry (Panmure), Monifieth, and inland at Forfar. Then
they can drag themselves aboard the night sleeper at Arbroath at 10.35pm
and be back in London just after seven the next morning -- certainly
exhausted but with enviable tales to tell.

<HEADLINE>Landowners in talks on deer culling</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975782197</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIONISTS and landowners met yesterday to thrash out a plan of
action for future deer management which could leave estates to establish
their own culling numbers.
The conference was organised jointly by the British Deer Society and
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in an effort to move closer to
an acceptable compromise where the environmental impact of deer is
reduced and their benefit to estates preserved.
The Red Deer Commission culls 50,000 of Scotland's 300,000 red deer
each year to keep a constant number. But this number of deer is still
causing considerable damage to the Highland landscape, and the
commission has decided to cull an additional 57,000 red deer.
There was general agreement among delegates that female deer, which
outnumber stags by almost two to one and cause the most damage,
particularly while pregnant, should be targeted.
Recent studies at reserves operated by RSPB and Scottish Natural
Heritage have shown that selective culling had reduced numbers to almost
a parallel of stags and females, and the damage to habitat was now
insubstantial.
It also resulted in fewer calves being born, which will create less of
a problem in the future.
General support was given for landowners to test out their own
selective culling, suiting their own purposes. But estates which run
sporting operations argued that they still required certain numbers of
deer to be commercially viable, thus restricting their culling plans.
The joint organisers of yesterday's seminar, attended by almost 300
delegates, admitted that although common ground had been highlighted and
progress was being made, a happy compromise was still a long way off.
Hugh Rose, of the British Deer Society, said: ''There is a surplus of
deer for sporting purposes, far too many to allow natural degeneration
of trees and heather. If we co-operate, we can bring maximum benefit to
both deer and habitat.''

Conrad Wilson asks if there is anyone for polo, and a rather good meal
THE Killermont Polo Club in Bearsden, recent recipient of an AA
rosette, is Glasgow's answer to Edinburgh's Indian Cavalry Club. Each
has its thematic roots in the last days of the Raj. Each is indebted to
decor for at least part of its success. But whereas the Edinburgh
restaurant is all whiteness and light, the Glasgow one has stained oak
panels, and a ceiling the colour of lentils to provide, in at least one
of its several rooms, a darker-toned faintly institutional impression of
British India.
The atmosphere indeed is sufficently clublike, in the British sense,
to make you wish that some of our genuine clubs served grub of such
quality. The place was once a manse and, from the outside, still looks
it. Only the canopied doorway and the Union Jack flying at the end of
the lawn suggest that all is not quite what it seems. Indoors, the walls
crammed with polo pictures, the glass-encased tunics, the trophies and
shields all fanatically confirm the fact that the proprietor is not only
a polo buff but a polo player. The huge bowl of after-dinner Polo mints
suggests he also has a polo-ish sense of humour.
The food, however, is quite serious, even if the menu groups the
dishes under such headings as ''The Jaipur Clubhouse Celebration'' and
''For the Grooms''. If this were merely a method of dressing up a
routine repertoire of pakoras, bhunas, and biryanis it would soon induce
irritation. But much of the repertoire is not routine and irritation is
in any case offset by the kitchen's lightness of touch and the young
staff's genial service.
Orange tandoori duck, tandoori salmon with roasted peppers, Goan-style
mussels with garlic and fresh herbs and parcels of plaice wrapped in
spinach point to the restaurant's desire to mix good Scottish
ingredients and garden herbs with good Indian methods. Lunchtime dishes
tend to be simpler --red-coated chicken pakora with two red sauces, or a
herby vegetable bhuna of cauliflower, tomato, and potatoes -- but no
less spicy, though one recent portion of lentil cakes with a ''medley of
yoghurts'' derived most of its flavour from the yoghurt.
Set lunches cost #6.95 and #7.95 and on certain nights there are
buffet dinners, with occasional experimental dishes, costing not much
more. There is a short wine-list, but a pint of draught Indian beer
seems the right thing to drink.
Art deco, which adds to the gaiety of the Polo Club, similarly
enhances Nicolson's restaurant, which lies at the top of a staircase
between Edinburgh's Festival Theatre and the Old Quad. First impressions
are spartan. The premises, it seems, were long derelict, and the fact
has not been entirely concealed. But the pale, bare, stripped
floorboards are offset by brilliant Mediterranean blue and yellow
paintwork and by the blue and yellow mobiles above the tables. Happily
the genuine metal window frames with art deco glasswork have been
preserved.
Nicolson's with justice calls itself a ''fresh food'' restaurant (the
Killermont Polo Club, with Glasgow humour, calls itself ''Probably the
Finest Restaurant in the World''). Dishes of the day may include an
excellent whole cooked crab, a whole grilled lobster, or a whole globe
artichoke, though wholeness, you will be relieved to know, is not a
feature of the monkfish, pieces of which come skewered with pitta bread.
Lamb is flavoured with rosemary and garlic. There are duck sandwiches
with loganberry vinaigrette, and various breads. Steaks come with chips.
Roasted vegetables come with olive-oil. Stuffed courgettes come with
sweet peppers and cream. Students and lecturers intermingle. The music
ranges from loud to very loud, but the pros outweight the cons. When
enough is enough, beat a retreat to the Festival Theatre's entrance
foyer for coffee and cakes.
* Killermont Polo Club, 222 Maryhill Road, Glasgow (Tel 0141 946
5412). Average price of a three-course dinner for two with beer, about
#46. Set lunches and buffet suppers cheaper.
* Nicolson's, 6a Nicolson Street, Edinburgh (Tel 0131 557 4567).
Average cost of a three-course meal for two with a bottle of wine, #40.
Sandwiches range from #3 to #8.50, depending on ingredients and size.

<HEADLINE>Surprise move follows talks. Britain to back nuclear test ban</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975782199</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to sign the South Pacific nuclear-free treaty, it was
announced yesterday.
The surprise move follows talks with France and the United States over
the so-called Treaty of Rarotonga.
The Foreign Office said Britain, France, and the US would sign the
treaty during the first half of 1996. It said the decision reflected
Britain's wish to respond in a practical way to the concerns of
countries in the region about nuclear tests.
So far 11 countries have signed the treaty, which bans the
acquisition, stationing, or testing of nuclear explosive devices and the
dumping of radioactive waste within the zone.
Prime Minister John Major will confirm Britain's intention to join the
nuclear-free zone in his speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the
United Nations in New York next week.
''Today's decision, taken jointly with France and the United States,
allows us to advance our position by sending the strongest possible
signal of support for a nuclear weapons-free zone in the South
Pacific,'' said the Foreign Office.
''The decision also reflects our wish to respond in a practical way to
the concerns of those in the region and elsewhere about nuclear testing.
It confirms our belief that an end to nuclear testing is in sight.''
The agreement will help to defuse worldwide anger over France's
resumption of testing, which began last month.
Greenpeace accused Britain of trying to shut the stable door after the
horse had bolted.
Mr William Peden, nuclear affairs spokesman, said: ''Why will they not
sign now rather than wait until the French have completed all their
tests?
''Although the Pacific in future will be free of nuclear weapons
testing, the radioactive and toxic legacy of hundreds of atmospheric and
underground tests by Britain, France, and the US will remain.
''The treaty will not stop the transportation of nuclear weapons and
materials through the region, such as plutonium from Britain and France
to Japan.''
In France, an official announcement said the three nations considered
that internationally recognised nuclear-free zones ''can contribute to
peace and international security''.
The brief statement did not mention France's resumption of testing in
French Polynesia, which ended a three-year moratorium and provoked
outrage in the South Pacific.
France has staged two underground tests so far and plans up to six
more before the end of May 1996 before banning testing forever.
President Jacques Chirac has said the tests are needed to check its
nuclear arsenal.
Australia, among the most vocal foes of the current round of French
tests, earlier welcomed the announced signing and urged Paris to cancel
the remaining blasts.
''It is France that is testing in the South Pacific and it is France
that must stop,'' Environment Minister John Faulkner said in Canberra.
New Zealand also called for an early end to the tests.
The British High Commissioner in Australia, Sir Roger Carrick, said
the aim now was to ensure that all five declared nuclear powers sign a
comprehensive test ban treaty by the end of 1996 as planned.
He refused to comment on the French tests. ''It's not for us to tell
another nuclear power how to ensure the safety and reliability and
credibility of its nuclear deterrent,'' he said. ''It's for the French
to justify, not us.''

DON JUAN DE MARCO (rental, cert 15).
* WHEN Johnny Depp's biography gets written, they ought to call it
Muesli; because, from the rebel-teen pastiche Cry Baby to the
look-back-in-angora biopic of Ed Wood, via Edward Scissorhands and Benny
and Joon, he's played nothing but fruit, nuts, and flakes.
If you share Couch Potato's fondness for vulnerable misfits and
wistful wack-a-doos, you'll have enjoyed Depp's career so far, and
you'll enjoy Don Juan De Marco too.
Here's the set-up: Depp, an ordinary young guy in ordinary modern
America, except for his habit of dressing up like Zorro in mask and cape
and carrying a flashing blade, believes he is the real Don Juan of
literary and operatic legend, demon lover and seducer of a thousand
dames. America being a nation founded on freedom of belief, this causes
him no problems until the loss of his one true love sends him over the
edge and on to a ledge, from which he gets talked down by kindly but
melancholy psychiatrist Dr Mickler (Marlon Brando) -- who has problems
enough of his own, already, most of them concerning his wife, Faye
Dunaway.
Depp gets committed to the good doctor's care for 10 days of diagnosis
and evaluation, and this is where the movie really gets going: his
''delusional'' recollections of his adventures (played in flashback) are
so exhilaratingly romantic and poetic that Dr Mickler becomes first
envious, then entranced, and finally almost convinced that his patient
is the real Don Juan McCoy. His wife becomes embroiled in the fantasy
too as they rediscover their old love and passion and . . . sniff,
snuffle, sob . . . aw, the the nice . . .
Deeply sentimental, but funny and strange enough not to be sticky, Don
Juan De Marco is the Saturday-night-date film of the year: see it with
someone you love, or want to love you.
D'ARTAGNAN'S DAUGHTER (retail, Artificial Eye, #15.99, cert 15; French
with English subtitles).
* SOME stories, given the right actors, script, and spirit, never grow
old; and Bertrand Tavernier's gloriously zestful and irony-free twist on
the immortal yarn of The Three Musketeers comes up as fresh and shiny as
a newly sharpened rapier.
Sophie Marceau, recently seen in Braveheart, stars as the plucky
daughter of retired swashbuckler D'Artagnan (Philippe Noiret) driven
from convent life by witnessing a fiendish political murder that exposes
a conspiracy against the young Louis XIV. Unable to rouse her has-been
father's interest, she sets off to warn the King herself, and only when
her own life is in danger does D'Artagnan wake up and call his old
comrades to arms for one last rip-roaring adventure of gloire, patrie,
and honneur. One for all and all for one -- and five'll get you ten if
you play your cards right. Terrific fun.

A SLIE OF LIFE
French restaurateur Pierre Levicky, 36, opened his first Pierre
Victoire in 1988. There are now 80 in the chain and he plans to open in
Paris next year. He lives in Edinburgh with his partner.
* BREAKFAST at 7am is just cups of Lavazza coffee, black, with lots of
sugar -- and cigarettes.
In Scotland, I don't think about food at all during the day: At my
parents' home in France, the day's food will be discussed, with
enthusiasm, first thing in the morning. Here I sometimes forget to eat.
But if I'm really hungry at 2pm, I send round to the nearest Pierre
Victoire for chicken, or pasta, or roast lamb with baguette. And if I'm
starving mid-afternoon, someone might go out and get me an apple.
I cook at home in the evening because I don't enjoy eating out in
restaurants very much. I like a salad of plain boring round lettuce with
good garlic vinaigrette and a piece of good bread. Or a salad frisee
with nuggets of smoked bacon: I toss the whole lot into melted butter
and do a quick deglace with vinegar for it to stay crunchy. I dress my
pasta, usually rigatoni, in olive oil, fresh cream, lots of pepper and
grated gruyere which you have to add at the right moment for it not to
melt too much.
I like a corn-fed chicken or French-imported ''poulet noir'', jointed,
pan-fried and finished with lemon -- no heavy cream sauces. I love apple
flan, which takes me 15 minutes to make. I sprinkle it with ''petite
farine'', a sort of crumble mix my grandmother used to make. It soaks up
the juices and is delicious. All with cream. I might have the odd ice
cream but don't go in for sweets at all, for fromage blanc by Onken, and
perhaps cheese.
My favourite is lamb, or rabbit done with white wine and thyme, and
the very occasional steak. I've never understood the English fondness
for jelly and don't like cheddar much.
My grandfather was Ukrainian and I cook some of the traditional
dishes, like my grandmother's rabbit pate, the kneidls, Paska cake at
Easter and boiled carp at Christmas.
My gastronomic dream would be a day-long Rabelasian meal for 10 with
12 dishes starting with several entrees, main dishes like veal or
octopus, lots of wine and chat. Otherwise, I have simple tastes and
wouldn't call myself an Epicurean.

AN epic effort is being made this weekend to sell Scotland to
Hollywood.
Five producers responsible for blockbusters such as Jurassic Park and
Schindler's List are visiting various areas of the country to assess
their attributes as locations for future crowd-pullers.
The ''familiarisation'' visit has been organised by the British Film
Commission, Scottish Screen Locations, and the Lothians Screen Locations
organisation which were represented by Sir Sydney Samuelson, Ms Cathy
Agnew, and Ms Celia Stevenson at a presentation at the Turnberry Hotel
yesterday.
The visiting team are Ed Lammi of Columbia TriStar, Jim McGee of NBC,
Reid Shane of the Kushner-Locke company, Donna Smith of Universal
Pictures, and Jerry Shevick of Hearst Entertainment.
They will see Edinburgh Castle today then tour the set of Jude, an
adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel Jude the Obscure, which is currently
being filmed on the Royal Mile.
Mr George Carlaw, screen industries officer for Edinburgh and the
Lothians, said yesterday: ''It was great news that we had been chosen as
the setting for Jude. Now these people can go back to Hollywood and
report on a lively and enterprising film scene in Edinburgh.''
The producers flew into Scotland yesterday and spent last night at the
Turnberry Hotel.
They will meet Scottish Arts Minister Lord Lindsay and the Lord
Provost of Edinburgh, Norman Irons, during their visit.
Edinburgh's string of credits as a filming location go back to 1935
when it was chosen for scenes in Alfred Hitchcock's version of John
Buchan's The Thirty-nine Steps. More recently it featured in Rob Roy.

GOVERNMENT plans to open up major road maintenance work to competition
were given the green light by a judge yesterday.
Lord Cameron dismissed an action by seven local authorities at the
Court of Session to suspend the tendering process for the work.
The judge said that the councils, which included Lothian, Tayside,
Fife, Central, and Borders, had failed to show that the Secretary of
State had acted beyond his powers.
His decision was announced less than two hours before yesterday's noon
deadline for bids to be submitted.
The Scottish Office announced plans last December for the management
of trunk roads and motorways after the reorganisation of local
government.
Councils claim that the new arrangements could lead to widespread job
losses and confuse the travelling public.
Lord Cameron ruled that the councils had failed to show that the
criteria set out by the Secretary of State were flawed to the extent
that the award of any contract would be unlawful.
The councils are now considering whether to appeal.

A POLITICAL storm engulfed the Government yesterday after its
contraceptive warning to 1.5 million women degenerated into a public
relations disaster.
Angry doctors complained that they learned of the warning about the
risk of deep-vein thrombosis -- blood clots in the legs -- through the
media, rather than through notification by the Department of Health.
Amid a torrent of recrimination, Labour demanded an explanation for
the confusion from Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell.
The chairman of the British Medical Association's Scottish GP
committee, Dr Brian Keighley, described it as the latest in a long line
of public relations disasters to hit general practitioners. In the past
week, doctors had been hit by changes in the prescribing of Temazepam as
well as changes to free prescription entitlement for men between 60 and
65.
Now, women patients were contacting their GPs before the Department of
Health's guidelines had even been received.
''If you look at the increase in costs of management of the health
service and the number of high profile high cost managers now in place,
this really is a failure of management and we expect better from people
who tell us how to manage the service.''
The Department of Health issued a statement last night saying:
''Enormous effort was put into ensuring that as many GPs and pharmacists
as possible were given the information in advance of the announcement.''
Professor Michael Rawlins, chairman of the Committee on Safety of
Medicines which issued the warning, had sent 190,000 first class letters
out to GPs and pharmacists on Wednesday.
The department's statement added: ''When any information of this
nature is released to the profession, it is inevitable that it will find
its way into media hands rapidly. This indeed was the case on Thursday
when broadcast media had the letter three hours before the planned media
release.
''The department then acted immediately to ensure that all sections of
the media were given the fullest information to avoid any confusion over
advice to women, who above all, require straightforward public health
information.''
The clinical director of Greater Glasgow's Family Planning and Sexual
Health Clinic, Dr Alison Bigrigg, said she expected that between 80% and
90% of women on the seven named pills -- Femodene, Femodene ED, Minulet,
Triadene, Tri-Minulet, Marvelon, and Mercilon -- would be advised to
switch to another oral combined pill such as Microgynon 30 Ovranet or
Loestrin.
However, only two months' supply of the alternative choice of pill
instead of the normal six months are likely to be issued initially
because of fears that pharmaceutical companies will have insufficient
stocks to meet demand.
Earlier yesterday, a leading scientist at the heart of the row,
Professor Walter Spitzer, accused Government doctors of breaking the
Hippocratic Oath by causing an ''epidemic of panic''.
Professor Spitzer, principal investigator in a five-country European
study, attacked the Government for acting on unpublished and unreviewed
findings.
He said by issuing the warning Professor Rawlins had ruined important
research into the effects of third-generation contraceptive pills.
The professor, whose findings formed a key element of the Government
decision, flew into London from a medical conference in Montreal,
Canada, for the sole purpose of setting the record straight.
He said that while he co-operated with a request from Professor
Rawlins for the research results he never expected the action that
followed.
''The core of the Hippocratic Oath is, above all, do no harm,'' he
said. ''I believe the Government has done harm. Every time you create an
epidemic of anxiety in the population you're doing harm.''
He said his findings that the pills might actually protect women
against heart attacks appeared to have been ignored.
But the author of the warning, Professor Rawlins, hit back, issuing a
strong defence of the action and launching a counter-attack on the
professor.
He said: ''In no way was our action premature. There is now clear
evidence of an increased risk of thrombosis with these pills and it is
right that women using them and doctors prescribing them should have
been made aware of this as soon as possible.
''It would be unfortunate if Professor's Spitzer's comments led to
confusion about the messages we have tried to get across in the
interests of public health. His problem appears to be that we have acted
quickly -- we believe that it was our duty to do so.''
He said he was left with no choice about making the public
announcement after the warning sent to doctors on Wednesday was leaked
to a journalist.
''It is not humanly possible to guarantee that all doctors will
receive a letter from me before the media,'' he said.
The Government's Committee on the Safety of Medicines raised the alarm
on Thursday after findings from three unpublished studies appeared to
show that women taking the pills were twice as likely as those on other
oral contraceptives to suffer deep vein thrombosis -- blood clots in the
legs.
Doctors were advised not to prescribe the pills to women who are
overweight, or have varicose veins or a history of thrombosis.
But the pills were not withdrawn and women were urged to keep taking
them until the end of their cycle and then discuss with their doctor
whether to switch to another contraceptive.
Within hours of the warning, a row erupted with doctors and drug
companies accusing the Government of acting too hastily.
Britain stands alone in issuing an alert about the pills. German
health officials were also concerned about the contraceptive but have
decided to take no immediate action.
Yesterday, the new Shadow Health Secretary, Harriet Harman, tabled a
parliamentary question to Mr Dorrell demanding to know how the warning
was handled.
Ms Harman, in her first full day after taking over from Margaret
Beckett, said: ''It is quite wrong that GPs and family planning doctors
are having to give advice to concerned patients on the basis of what
they see on television and read in newspapers.''
She said a Department of Health helpline set up to deal with calls
from worried women was ''hopelessly inadequate'' -- after she had
herself tried all day to get through without success.

Late move to quieten criticism from the charities
A GOVERNMENT move to assess the impact of the National Lottery on
donations was welcomed by charities last night.
The Home Office announcement of a research project to study donations
to voluntary groups over the past 11 months follows repeated claims that
charities are losing out to the lottery.
The National Council for Voluntary Organisations, which has estimated
that charities have lost #300m since the lottery began, said that the
announcement showed Ministers were listening.
Home Office Minister Baroness Blatch claimed the Government had always
been committed to monitoring the effect of the lottery on charities, but
denied that it had had a significant effect on their income.
However the NCVO's director of policy, Ms Janet Morrison, suggested
that the Government had been pushed into taking action.
Ms Morrison added that research so far showed that most fundraising
charities had suffered badly.
''We have carried out quarterly research by asking people how much
they are giving to charity and how much they were giving before the
lottery was set up,'' said Ms Morrison.
''If the results of our last three months research were translated
over a year then charities would have lost #330m.''
She continued: ''We obviously would not have campaigned so hard on
this if we thought that the Government always intended to set up its own
monitoring exercise.''
In September the Royal National Institute for the Blind claimed
donations had fallen by a third since the lottery began in November last
year. It estimated a loss in donations of #500,000 over the year.
The RNIB revealed 10 days ago that it would have to close one of its
schools for severely disabled children in England, saying the effects of
the lottery were partly to blame.
Lady Blatch said researchers would closely study charities' income
before and after the lottery.
She said: ''The Government . . . still believes that the National
Lottery will be a significant new source of funding for charities.
''The lottery has been in operation for less than a year and the early
evidence is very mixed whether there has been any significant effect on
voluntary sector income.
''The research will look in detail at all the main sources of
charitable income -- such as donations, trading, and legacies -- and
will monitor changes in each since the introduction of the lottery.''
The lottery organisers, Camelot, welcomed the move, saying claims
about the way charities were suffering had so far been based only on
anecdotal evidence.
A spokesman said: ''We expect the results to show that the voluntary
sector will be better off from the National Lottery.''
Camelot's rivals recently launched instant scratchcards aimed at
raising money for specific charities in a bid to cash in on the damage
the lottery was said to be doing.
Littlewood's, the pools firm, has a range of cards dedicated to named
charities. The Royal British Legion has also been involved in setting up
a card to raise money for the November Poppy Appeal.
Other NCVO officials were confident that the Government would discover
that charities were suffering very badly.
Its chief executive, Mr Stuart Etherington, said: ''Our research on
individual giving has suggested that fundraising charities are losing
public donations, particularly in raffles, street collections, and
door-to-door collections since the introduction of the National Lottery.
''We welcome the Government's commitment to monitoring the effects of
the lottery on charities. They have listened to our concerns and
responded positively. We look forward to working with them.''

Brussels
NATO began the search for a new secretary general last night after
Belgium's Willy Claes, protesting his innocence, bowed to the inevitable
and quit in the midst of a pending trial for bribery.
Alliance Foreign Ministers are gathering today in New York for a
weekend of celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the United
Nations and are expected to produce a short leet of candidates.
Mr Douglas Hurd, former Foreign Secretary, and mr Hans van den Broek,
European foreign affairs commissioner, both ruled themselves out
yesterday.
The front runners now include Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark's
former Foreign Minister, and Mr Ruud Lubbers, former Prime Minister of
The Netherlands. American Senator Sam Nunn has also been mentioned.
Mr Claes made a dignified but furious exit from the job, complaining
he was the victim of ''political murder''. He denounced the Belgian
legal system which, he said, had violated the principle of a man being
innocent until proved guilty.
''First, Nato -- and then my personal destiny,'' he told reporters,
denying he was embittered but admitting he was angry at what he
described as an injustice.
Faced with another year of investigations into his alleged complicity
in the Agusta helicopter scandal which has gripped Belgium, he said: ''I
don't know when the trial will start. It is, of course, not so
optimistic a perspective for me.''
In a 20-minute resignation speech, he continued to proclaim his
innocence, arguing he and his family were the victims of a personal
tragedy. ''On my word of honour as a Belgian Minister of State I
confirmed before the parliamentary commission I was in no way involved
in such fraudulent practices, nor did I condone them,'' he said of the
claims that he was a participant in the corruption scandal.
Mr Claes's Flemish Socialist Party was found to have accepted more
than #1m, allegedly from the Agusta company, an Italian firm of
helicopter manufacturers, when he was Belgium's Finance Minister.
Mr Claes complained that the law used to prosecute him was 164 years
old and had never been brought up to date ''as it should have been''. He
added: ''I am convinced I have been unjustly treated.''
He said: ''I will continue to be what I have always been -- a
fighter.''
Mr Claes is the first Nato secretary general in its 46-year history to
be forced out of the job.

GLASGOW'S hopes of creating a prestigious city centre art gallery rose
sharply yesterdaywhen the Post Office announced that fresh bids would be
invited for its George Square building.
The decision to defer a final decision for two weeks, a move which
emerged only hours before the successful bidder was due to be named, was
accompanied by a new stipulation in the tender for the property.
Any developer of the building will now have to accommodate a new
postal museum to display priceless items of Scottish philately,
currently housed in London.
Supporters of the plan for a new National Gallery of Scottish Art and
Design in Glasgow were buoyed by yesterday's twists, and more confident
that they could beat off bids from two private developers, who have
proposed office and retail alternatives for the property, and have
offered more money.
The supporters hope, privately, that the Post Office may be paving the
way for acceptance of the gallery bid, which was put forward by the
Glasgow Development Agency on behalf of the Trustees of the National
Galleries of Scotland.
Inclusion of the philately museum appears to skew the tender back in
favour of the gallery bid for two reasons:
* The decrease in available floor space by about 20,000 sq ft will
also cut the building's commercial value.
* The Post Office would, presumably, be happier to have a museum in a
gallery building than a retail or office block.
In addition, the Post Office said yesterday that the final decision on
the George Square building would, effectively, lie with the Scottish
Postal Board.
The board directors would ''look outwith commercial considerations and
take account of social, cultural and political factors, in so far as
they impact on the good name of the Post Office''.
None of the interested parties was giving much away publicly
yesterday.
.
The GDA and Glasgow District Council expressed disappointment that a
decision had not been made yesterday, but made it clear they expected to
take part in the new tendering process, for which bids have to be made
by November 3.
Council leader Pat Lally said: ''I would hope that the Post Office
Board will remember that, as a public body, they have public as well as
financial responsibilities.''
The National Galleries' trustees said they would continue to work
closely ''with the project's partners to achieve a successful outcome''.
While yesterday's developments appear not to help the two private
bidders, at least one is determined to bid again.
Mr Scott Murray, a spokesman for Aberdeen development company Jarlaw,
said details of the new tender had not yet been received. However, he
added: ''It is our firm intention to re-bid, and we will try to
accommodate the Post Office's museum plan.''
A spokeswoman for the other bidder, Edinburgh-based Morrison
Developments, said no decision on re-bidding would taken until the new
tender arrived, and the company had reviewed its position.

A FOUR-YEAR-OLD boy yesterday became the first victim of explosive
devices washed up on a stretch of Scottish coast.
Gordon Baillie was playing in the garden of an uncle's home, close to
the shoreline near Campbeltown, when he came across what police
described as a phosphorus flare.
As he held it, it began burning his hand and leaked on to his clothes
and started smoking. An aunt doused his clothes and pulled them from his
body. He was taken by an uncle to a local hospital, where he was treated
for burns.
The child was allowed home, but will return to hospital today for a
further examination.
At least 4000 explosive devices have been washed ashore in recent
weeks, prompting meetings between concerned local MPs and the Ministry
of Defence. However, yesterday's first recorded injury from the
explosive devices is certain to add to the MPs' fears.
Police, who believe the object may have been put in the garden by
someone after being found on the shoreline, warned the public not to
handle the devices.
A spokesman said: ''In no circumstances should the public attempt to
handle any of the devices, which burn when they dry out. If they find
them they should contact their local police office as soon as
possible.''
The sudden appearance of the explosive devices on the coastline around
Ayrshire and Arran has led to alarm among environmentalists.
The environmentalists fear the devices may be connected with the
post-war dumping of munitions off the West Coast of Scotland,
particularly in Beaufort's Dyke, a deep seabed trench between Scotland
and Northern Ireland.
The objects resemble short sections of drain pipe, with a bone-like
texture. They are safe in water, but heat up and start smoking as they
dry out in air.
Police believe they may be phosphorus-based flares, but the Ministry
of Defence says it is baffled bythem and, whatever they are, they do not
originate in the UK.

London is getting far more than its fair share of National Lottery
cash, according to a study carried out for BBC2's Newsnight programme.
Around 25% of lottery grants handed out so far have gone to the capital.
Greater London is getting on average nearly #21 for each person. By
comparison Scotland gets #10.95. In Strathclyde the figure is #3.15.
