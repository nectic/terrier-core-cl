IF HOME is where you rest your hat, The Hatrack at 144 St Vincent
Street has just become home to a couple of professional firms.
One of Glasgow's best-known architectural gems and currently on the
city's Heritage Trail, The Hatrack got its nickname from its tall,
narrow lines, its Art Nouveau curves, and the the projections from the
rooftop cupola. The landmark Edwardian office building, which adjoins
the Scottish Amicable Headquarters, was designed by James Salmon in 1899
and has been renovated by Dasim Developments to provide open-plan office
accommodation. Many of the architectural and interior features have been
restored or maintained.
The building has now attracted its first tenants: 3D Chartered
Architects and Watson Maitland Solicitors, who have leased the sixth and
fifth floors respectively. The lettings were negotiated by agents J
Trevor &amp; Webster and Lambert Smith Hampton.
This letting leaves the ground and five upper floors, each of 2100 sq
ft available to let. Rents for the Hatrack stand at #10 sq ft before
incentives.

AFTER a surge of pre-lettings, Wimpey Property's new retail
development in Motherwell town centre is almost fully let prior to its
opening next month.
The first pre-letting was concluded with Woolworths, who will be the
anchor tenant. They have taken the largest unit of 14,000 sq ft and will
be trading from 8 September.
Three further pre-lettings have recently been agreed to Allsports,
Strand Libraries and Stepek. These units are all approximately 1880 sq
ft on the ground floor and rents have been agreed at approximately #45
per sq ft.
Two further units are now under offer to a fashion and shoe retailer
respectively.
The available units range in size from 2,200 sq ft to 2700 sq ft on
the ground floor with first-floor cover. Joint letting agents King
Sturge &amp; Co and Smith Cole Wright report interest in the three remaining
units.

FOR many elderly people, one of the greatest problems can be shortage
of money. Yet Government figures show that in Scotland alone, more than
#60m in state benefits goes unclaimed in a year.
What this shows clearly, is that whatever other sectors of the
population choose to do, the over-sixties take up of means-tested
benefits is well below that of other groups.
Age Concern Scotland's welfare rights officer Sue Ramsden says: ''The
average unclaimed is over #13 a week in income support, and more than
#16 a week in housing benefit. Many people don't know what they can
claim, or have difficulty in filling in forms. Pensioners are losing out
by not claiming all their entitlements.''
Earlier this year, Strathclyde Regional Council ran a take-up campaign
which highlighted the numbers of disabled older people failing to claim
attendance allowance. More than 9000 receiving homecare services from
the social work department were encouraged to claim. Of the known
decisions, 69% were successful. A claim for attendance allowance can
boost weekly income by #31.20 or more.
A major difficulty of course, is the fact that it can be
extraordinarily complicated to work out what the entitlements to which
anyone has a right are.
Age Concern Scotland advise that comprehensive independent advice on
entitlement to welfare benefits is available from a welfare rights
officer (normally within the local social work department) or Citizens'
Advice Bureau (find their number in your local telephone directory).
Older people contacting their local Benefits Agency says Age Concern,
may find that they are advised of entitlement to income support, but not
of the possible right to other benefits to help with disability.
However, the Benefits Agency is trying to develop a ''one stop shop''
service -- and the sooner the better.
Similarly, those enquiring about housing benefit at their local
housing department, may not be told about other income-related or
disability benefits, and many forms for benefits are long and complex --
the attendance allowance claim for example, runs to no less than 35
pages.
Little surprise then, that without help, older people often simply
don't fill them in. Still less surprising, is that the Government finds
itself with millions of pounds of unclaimed state benefits.
Attendance allowance, payable at one of two weekly rates, is currently
#46.70 or #31.20, and is intended for those who are ill or disabled,
requiring help with personal care, supervision or someone to oversee
them because of physical or mental illness, or disability.
This allowance is based on the help a person needs, not what she or he
actually gets, and how they spend the non-means-tested, tax-free amount
is up to the individual. However, your local authority may take it into
account when assessing whether, or how much, needs to be paid towards
any social services provided by them.
When the home in which an elderly person or couple has raised a family
for example, becomes too large, expensive, and difficult to run in the
more mature years, sheltered or retirement housing may be the ideal
answer.
This usually means a purpose-built development which offers a number
of amenities, which could include communal facilities such as a lounge,
laundry and guest bedrooms. There may be an emergency alarm system
and/or the services of a warden who may or may not be resident.
Since such bungalows or flats are purpose-built for older people, they
incorporate all sorts of useful gadgets and ideas aimed at making life
easier and safer for their owners. There are both local authority and
private facilities of this type.
Age Concern Scotland has a useful fact sheet (fact sheet two) on
Sheltered and Retirement Housing for Sale in Scotland which explains the
principles of such housing, the kinds of questions to which you will
need to find answers, and the costs and obligations you will have to
meet.
Age Concern's fact sheet six, outlines some very useful information on
Finding Help at Home. It guides readers through a wide range of sources
of help which may be available to enable an elderly person to remain
living in their own home.
Similarly valuable, is their fact sheet 29, which covers the many
questions and points to be considered in Finding Residential and Nursing
Home Accommodation.
This is a most useful guide covering an area fraught with potential
trauma. It looks at types of care home and discusses how to find a
residential or nursing home (and finding one for a very disabled or
mentally frail older person). Respite and convalescent care, questions
to ask when choosing a home, methods of payment and so on.
Bear one thing in mind; it's always a good idea to take soundings from
other people you know who have personal experience of a home, or who
have a relative or friend resident in one. Personal recommendation is
invaluable. Try to take your time and visit a number of homes, armed
with your list of carefully thought-out questions as well as using your
eyes and ears.

WHILE no-one is pretending the retail market has bounced back to
previous levels of profitability, the fact remains that in Scotland's
capital city demand outstrips supply for prime well-configured retail
premises.
Princes Street is testimony to this with a list of unsatisfied
accommodation requirements, some of which have been around for a
considerable period of time. The most recent significant letting on
Princes Street was to a Canadian lingerie retailer, La Senza, who
acquired premises at the former Palace Hotel development site on the
corner of Princes Street and Hanover Street, which was decimated by fire
around two-and-a-half years ago.
They reportedly not only paid the quoting rent of #158 per sq ft Zone
A but also made a #100,000 key money premium payment to the landlords to
secure the site.
Landlords keen to capitalise on the demand for Edinburgh retail
accommodation include Edinburgh District Council, owners of the Gyle
Shopping Centre in conjunction with Marks &amp; Spencer and Safeway, who
have submitted a planning application for a 30,000 sq ft ten-unit
extension to their scheme and are talking in terms of #80 per sq ft Zone
A for new lettings. AMP, the owners of the Cameron Toll Shopping Centre
to the South-east of the city centre are working on proposals to improve
the car parking facilities and extend and refurbish their scheme. Zone A
rates currently sit at just over #70 per sq ft for prime space.
While Princes Street may be regarded as totally prime and
multiple-retailer oriented in terms of fashions and footwear, George
Street (running parallel and to the north of Princes Street) has in
recent times further established itself as a quality retailing location
which is also attracting strong tenant interest. Zone A rates sit at #60
to #65 per sq ft for the north side of the street and approximately #50
for the south side.
Edinburgh's two city centre schemes to the east end of Princes Street,
The Waverley Shopping Centre and the St James Centre, have both been the
subject of major refurbishment over the past three years. Waverley has
both multiple and specialist retailers with a heavy fashion orientation
and also plays host to reputably the busiest food court in Scotland.
Zone A rates sit at #70 per sq ft.
The landlords are currently considering creating a large unit of some
10,000 sq ft over two levels if a suitable retailer in line with the
quality of the scheme comes forward seeking such accommodation who can
take advantage of the close proximity to Princes Street and the hugely
busy Waverley Station.
The St James Centre has seen recent acquisitions by The Works and the
Post Office -- prime Zone A rents are established at #100 per sq ft.
CIN, the landlords, acquired the adjacent St Andrew Square bus station
site and are formulating proposals to extend their scheme.
Out of town demand remains high. The best retail park site in
Edinburgh is Clerical &amp; Medical's Hermiston Gait, scheduled for opening
in October with a full tenant line-up in place to include Children's
World and Shoe City. The location, to the west on the intersection of
the Edinburgh Ring Road and the new M8 extension, has attracted interest
and rents are as high as #18 to #20 per sq ft.
Another superb site for retail warehousing is under the control of
Stannifer Developments in partnership with Millers at Craigleith Quarry,
adjacent to the modern Sainsbury superstore. An open consent for
approximately 100,000 sq ft of non-food retail has been obtained and
again interest is high from prospective tenants.
Other out of centre retail developments include Dutch company MBO and
Morrison Developments' 130,000 sq ft proposed non-food retail park at
London Road, Edinburgh, which sits in close proximity to the city centre
and Meadowbank Sports Stadium on a main arterial route.
To the east of Edinburgh Glassedin, the original developers of
Kinnaird Park adjacent to the A1, which houses Edinburgh's only UCI
Multiscreen Cinema, have obtained planning for 120,000 sq ft of non-food
retail with an open consent on what is known as the former brickworks
site a couple of hundred yards from their original development. Hypo
Property Services, now the owners of Kinnaird Park, have made an
application to extend their scheme by a further 75,000 sq ft which will
include a large percentage of leisure use.
Demand for good quality space, in Edinburgh is strong, however, it is
noticeable that retailers are far less prepared to compromise regarding
optimum spacial criteria and layout. They have learned lessons
themselves, and from failed competitors who rushed into acquisitions
only to pay a price later when times toughened.

Larnaca, Wednesday
LAWYERS for three British soldiers accused of killing a young Danish
woman in Cyprus claimed today that the men had been unlawfully arrested
by police.
The lawyers took turns grilling a police witness, concentrating on
their claim the defendants were not cautioned as demanded by law when
they were arrested at a police roadblock.
One of the lawyers, Christos Pourgourides, told reporters that the
submission, if accepted by the court, would automatically render
important prosecution evidence inadmissible, including confessions the
soldiers made to police.
They are accused of killing Danish tour guide Louise Jensen, 23, in
the south-eastern tourist resort of Ayia Napa last September.
Alan Ford, 26, of Birmingham, Justin Fowler, 26, of Falmouth, and Jeff
Parnell, 23, of Oldbury, West Midlands, deny manslaugher, kidnapping,
and conspiracy to rape.
They are serving with the 1st Battalion, the Royal Green Jackets
Regiment at the British base at Dhekelia.
Miss Jensen was allegedly kidnapped on the outskirts of Ayia Napa as
her Cypriot boyfriend gave her a ride home on his motorcycle. He raised
the alarm and the soldiers were arrested at the roadblock 90 minutes
later.
Miss Jensen's naked and battered body was found in a shallow grave
near Ayia Napa two days later.
Andreas Eleftheriou, a constable with the British base's civilian
police, maintained throughout nearly five hours of cross-examination
today that the soldiers were properly cautioned by the Cypriot policeman
who arrested them at the roadblock.
Eleftheriou denied a defence suggestion that there had been a
concerted effort by police to conceal an illegal arrest.--AP.

NOT for many years, has Edinburgh offered so much potential for a
developer to create a successful high quality warehouse scheme. Demand
is improving and the supply of quality space is at an all-time low.
Yet despite these encouraging factors, the capital is failing to offer
potential occupiers the type of space they require in the correct
location, with the result being that companies are relocating elsewhere,
more often than not in West Lothian.
The primary reason for the lack of development is a genuine dearth of
suitable sites. This can partly be attributed to the Thatcherite laissez
faire approach to planning and the resultant loosening of regulations in
1989 permitting out-of-town office development.
Sites which had potential for good quality industrial development were
acquired on a speculative basis by developers in the late eighties for
future Class 4 office development.
Since then, demand for out-of-town offices in anything but prime
locations, has fallen back and some developers have been left with
peripheral sites which are overvalued. They are either unwilling or
unable to take a hit on value and create a successful warehouse scheme
which would be more appropriate.
The problem is well illustrated on the west side of Edinburgh which
continues to be the preferred location for the majority of new occupiers
looking for warehouse accommodation.
At South Gyle there are only two small development sites within
Premier Property Group's South Gyle Crescent Lane which are available
for immediate warehousing development. Other sites are either earmarked
for Class 4 office development or owned by the district council who are
unable to develop speculatively themselves.
The recent findings of an industrial floorspace survey carried out by
King Sturge &amp; Co have confirmed that warehousing development on the west
side of Edinburgh is a viable option. In addition to confirming that
prime rents of #5.15 per sq ft have been established, equally
encouraging for developers was the fact that a relatively low vacancy
rate of 6.9% existed for units of between 10,000 and 25,000 sq ft as
opposed to the Lothian Region average of 9%.
Where a developer has taken advantage of some of these factors is at
Queen Anne Drive, Newbridge, where Joint Properties were bold enough to
build speculatively 52,000 sq ft of warehousing accommodation. Although
perceived as an inferior location to South Gyle, the lack of suitable
alternatives and an improvement in demand has meant that over the last
12 months some 42,000 sq ft has now been let with the final 10,000 sq ft
under offer.
Historically, warehousing space has been notoriously difficult to
lease from plans and this is a good example of a developer being able to
capitalise on occupiers requiring immediate entry to existing
accommodation.
This success is evidence that Newbridge is improving as a warehousing
location with easy access to the M8 and M9 motorways as well as
Edinburgh Airport. This improved reputation is likely to be further
enhanced by the completion of the M8 extension later in 1995.
From an investor's viewpoint, there has been a scarcity of good
quality product coming on to the market and consequently when something
exciting has appeared, interest has been significant with bullish yields
being achieved. The sale of the Post Office sorting depot at Hermiston
Gait at 6.9% off #4 per sq ft and the ScottishPower unit on Cultins Road
at 7.5% off #5.15 per sq ft is evidence of genuine investor demand for a
product that is rarely available.
It has been quite some time since the demand/supply equation has
looked so encouraging for speculative warehouse development on
Edinburgh's west side. The question now will be which developer or
landowner will come up with the best site.

WE are often asked if there is still strong demand for ''leisure
properties'' throughout Scotland. Classifying which type of businesses
come under the ''leisure'' category -- golf courses immediately spring
to mind, but one has to remember that general sports complexes, tennis
clubs, bowling alleys, casino complexes, cinemas, bingo halls and even
smaller units such as bookmakers are also included.
There have been many successful new build golf courses which spring to
mind, such as Dalmahoy, and we have noticed that time share developments
often seem to sell better if they have a golf course included.
Developments such as those at Loch Lomond and Craigendarroch at Ballater
now seem to be running successfully.
The David Lloyd Centre, situated just off the M8 at Renfrew, has
proven extremely successful and they are now believed to be looking to
the east coast. However, good road access with a heavy population
catchment is vital. David Lloyd's entry into the tennis and fitness club
market in 1982 provided a bonus for those local authorities which
commissioned him to run their facilities. His #50m flotation during 1993
proved hugely successful.
Edinburgh and the east coast in general really does have a market for
further leisure centres such as David Lloyd, however, we believe that it
is not the luxury end of the market which has the greatest potential in
the east coast.
Established sportsmen and women are generally well catered for by
private clubs and championship courses like Muirfield, St Andrews and
Gleneagles but there is expanding interest in most sports from younger
and less affluent enthusiasts who demand the option of pay-as-you-play,
but are unwilling to travel long distances.
The sports council have indicated that the east coast of Scotland has
a demand for large leisure facilities with wide appeal from all sports.
We feel that for sports such as golf, tennis and other ball sports,
development of wide appeal venues will be dependent on Government
funding.
Although casinos have been talked about over recent years new laws and
proposed guidelines will be all important, not only for the east coast,
but for Britain as a whole. With four casinos in Edinburgh, the size of
the capital would indicate that there could be scope for more, however,
licensing is still difficult.
Musselburgh Racecourse has recently undergone further expansion. While
racecourse owners are pleased with their increase in popularity, it has
spread to bookmakers and most of the corporates are looking for prime
trading locations in Edinburgh, particularly in densely populated areas.
Sunday trading has proven successful in Edinburgh and the east
generally.
The gambling fever has spread to bingo halls which have seen one of
the biggest changes in recent years. Gone are the days of theatre-style
buildings being the most popular for bingo halls but now corporates such
as Gala, Paramount and Mecca are all looking for sites for new bingo
halls in and around the Edinburgh area.
Interestingly these companies would all prefer to build from scratch
and are now looking at retail parks where they can build units with
approximately 30,000 sq ft. Although at the lower end we will continue
to see average size sports clubs, health clubs, bookmakers, bingo halls
and even up to cinemas, major leisure developments planned for Edinburgh
will probably need Government support in organisational as well as in
financial terms. The leisure business in Britain today is worth more
than #25 billion a year and in view of its overall potential Edinburgh
has not bitten off nearly as big a slice of the cake as it could have.

DICK Hern is scenting more Derby glory after a sparkling performance
yesterday by Alhaarth in the Lanson Champagne Stakes at Goodwood. The
colt's one-length defeat of Allied Forces prompted quotes as low as 16-1
favourite for the classic test.
But Hern, with 14 classics, including three Derbys, to his credit is
not getting carried away just yet. ''I think it's stupid to boost up
horses too much. So much can happen and so much water has to go under
the bridge,'' he said.
Alhaarth, the 5-6 favourite, showed plenty of courage to land the
spoils after being impeded and losing ground two furlongs out. But
Willie Carson soon had the colt back into his stride and he quickened
smartly to seal the issue inside the final furlong.
''It looked as if he got a nasty bump,'' said Hern. ''He came off a
true line and I thought: 'This is a bit near home for this to happen,'
so he did well to win.
''Anyway, before the race I saw an Irish priest who comes over every
year and I said: 'Say a little prayer for us.' It might have done us a
little good.''
Alhaarth, who holds entries in the Dewhurst Stakes and Racing Post
Trophy, may run next in the Laurent-Perrier Champagne Stakes at
Doncaster on September 7.
Walter Swinburn produced a great effort aboard Pilsudski to beat the
favourite Rokeby Bowl by a neck in the Tote Gold Trophy. But the
jockey's performance did not impress the stewards, who suspended him for
two days (August 4 and 5) for careless riding.
They found that Pilsudski had interfered with Craigmill on the home
turn, but decided that the result had not been affected.
Meanwhile, Juyush can prove the joker in the pack in today's Tiffany
Goodwood Cup.
Double Trigger looks sure to go off at a short price -- and deservedly
so after running away with the Ascot Gold Cup last month, but it is
worth having a small interest in Juyush, who has been prepared with this
race in mind.
He was a high-class two-year-old, finishing third in the Royal Lodge
Stakes and Racing Post Trophy. Trainer Barry Hills has always believed
Juyush would come into his own when given a real test of stamina and,
even though the colt won over Doncaster's mile on his reappearance, he
decided to by-pass the 2000 Guineas and Derby.
Juyush next won when stepped up to a mile and a half for the first
time at Ascot last month, easily outpointing Warning Order. Subsequently
sent off favourite for an extended mile and threequarter listed race at
Newmarket, Juyush ran as if an extra furlong would do no harm, staying
on but lacking the pace to overturn Grey Shot.
Double Trigger should not be considered invincible over two miles and
the rest do not have the look of a vintage field.
Moscow Mist can make the most of bottom weight to land the Schweppes
Golden Mile.
Vindaloo is napped to make history in the opening Crowther Homes
Handicap. The ultra-tough colt has taken all before him in recent weeks
to equal the 20th Century record of nine handicap wins in a season.
He has been very well handicapped to win his last two starts on the
all-weather, but he is also only 3lb higher than when scoring on turf at
Leicester last week, being awarded first after going down by a short
head to Artic Courier but being impeded.
That was a decent race and it is quite conceivable that Vindaloo has
not stopped improving.

Sihanoukville, Wednesday
A FORMER Khmer Rouge guerrilla was sentenced today to 15 years in jail
for his role in last year's murder of three Westerners, including two
Britons, after the defence argued that he was only following orders.
Four other rebels were sentenced in their absence for terms ranging
from 16 to 20 years, along with commander Sam Bo, who was charged with
having given the execution order.
They were convicted of premeditated murder and being members of the
outlawed Khmer Rouge.
The defence counsel told the court in Sihanoukville that if Chuon
Mean, 30, and four other rebels had refused Sam Bo's order to shoot the
captives, they would also have been shot.
Chuon Mean had confessed to the murder of Australian Kellie Wilkinson,
24, her British boyfriend, Dominic Chappell, 25, and their friend Tina
Dominy, 24, also from Britain.
The defendant told the court that the three ''did not cry or beg, they
died immediately''.
The trio were taken captive on April 11 last year when their taxi was
stopped during a Khmer Rouge ambush.
Relatives and foreign diplomats at the trial said they were satisfied
with the result although questions remained as to when Cambodian police
first became aware of the murders.
''I think it's a very fair result, justice has been seen to be done,''
said David Chappell, Dominic's father.
His mother Phyllida and sister Gabrielle burst into tears as the
defendant was brought into the court and cried throughout the session.
In Canberra, Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the
government was pleased with the verdict but he hoped the others
responsible for the murders, particularly the commander, would also be
brought to justice.--Reuter.

COURSE records were smashed like cheap crockery at a fairground amid
fast ground and fine weather at Doncaster yesterday.
Iltimas put up a courageous display to take the six-furlong Vaux
Samson Conditions Stakes in record time.
Attempting to make all, the 11-8 favourite looked booked for second as
Averti forced his head in front entering the closing stages, but the
filly battled back approaching the line and got up to win by a short
head.
In doing so, she lowered the record set by Ryecroft in 1959.
Another record fell 35 minutes later as Carlito Brigante took the
Wards Best Bitter Handicap over an extended mile and a quarter, taking
nearly a second off the time recorded by Silver Cloud in 1963.
Lynda Ramsden's three-year-old was taken to the front by Kieran Fallon
approaching the final furlong and held off the late challenge of Once
More For Luck by half a length.

JOCKEY of the moment Brett Doyle, successful on Sayyedati in the
Sussex Stakes at Goodwood yesterday afternoon, completed a 37[1/2]-1
double aboard Gentle Irony at Epsom last night.
Doyle had set the first leg up after getting up on Neville Callaghan's
6-1 shot Balpare in the EBF Walton Maiden Stakes half an hour earlier.
Rodney Moogan, a 5lb claimer with Reg Akehurst, was banned for three
days at the meeting after having been found guilty of continuing to use
his whip on a horse who was out of contention, Newport Knight, in the
seven-runner Warren Apprentices' Handicap. His suspension takes effect
on August 4,5 and 7.

Washington, Wednesday
A TOP Republican politican pleaded guilty today to conspiring to
violate United States sanctions against Libya imposed over Lockerbie.
Charles Wade, 57, of Kentucky, admitted he accepted #384,000 in 1992
from Libya in exchange for attempting to influence US Government policy
and to have the economic sanctions lifted.
The sanctions were imposed after Libya refused to surrender for trial
two Libyans who have been charged in the bombing, which caused 270
deaths.
Wade, the former Kentucky state Republican Party director, admitted
meeting New York businessman William Bodine, Libyan Government
officials, and others in Libya and Europe, prosecutors said.
He also agreed to contact high-ranking Bush administration officials
on behalf of Libya for a #5.3m annual fee.
The payment that Libya made to Wade had been funnelled through several
dummy companies the conspirators set up in Geneva and the British Virgin
Islands to disguise the source of the funds, they said.
Wade faces up to five years in prison for violating the Libyan
sanctions regulations, plus a fine of up to twice his gross gain from
the conspiracy. He will be sentenced in October.--Reuter.

THE licensed trade property market in and around the Edinburgh area
has remained popular with local, national and international buyers. It
still provides solid investments for those purchasing hotels or public
houses and individuals and companies are continuing to invest in new
developments.
As regards purchase and sale of existing hotels and pubs, the market
is generally quiet. Not so much because of a shortage of buyers, but a
shortage of quality Edinburgh hotels and public houses that are
available for sale. Such is the attractive return in terms of trade and
profit which many owners achieve, they are happy to hold on to their
business hence very few are coming on to the market.
Recent hotel sales have taken place across the spectrum. At one end,
the English-based Regal Hotel Group have purchased the 32-bedroom
Queensferry Lodge Hotel at North Queensferry for a price rumoured to be
in the region of #3.8m. At the other end of the spectrum, Christie &amp; Co
were involved in the sale of the Lairg Hotel, Coates Gardens, in the
West End of Edinburgh. This is a 10-bedroom, stone-built terraced hotel
which sold within a few months of coming on the market at offers in the
region of #345,000.
New developments confirm the continuing confidence to invest in
Edinburgh. These include the Stakis Edinburgh Airport Hotel. The
majority of the other new developments taking place in Edinburgh city
are orientated toward the budget hotel sector, similar in nature to the
Charing Cross Tower Hotel which recently opened in Glasgow. An example
of this is the Whitbread Travel Inn, under construction at the Morrison
Street site on Haymarket. Another development is by Kantel on Bread
Street. This is a hotel with more than 100 bedrooms adjacent to Lothian
Road and the new Edinburgh Conference Centre.
This picture of Edinburgh hotels also applies to the public house
sector. While there have been no significant recent pub deals to report,
this is principally due to the lack of any quality public houses
becoming available on the open market.
There is no shortage, however, of purchasers from within and outwith
Edinburgh willing to bid for any quality pub which comes on the market.
The scarceness of these properties becoming available has meant that pub
values have remained healthy in comparison to other sectors of the
property market.
Edinburgh pub prices in general terms are higher than those in other
major Scottish cities principally due to rarity value and the good solid
base of trade which Edinburgh benefits from.
Edinburgh is still heavily licensed in terms of pubs, particularly in
the city centre, but despite the high concentration, performance of
these pubs has been maintained and still provide attractive investments
for brewers and private owners alike.
Of the major brewers, Scottish and Newcastle Retail remain the
dominant owner of public houses in Edinburgh, with Alloa also having a
strong presence. Maclays of Alloa have just purchased their first pub in
Edinburgh, the Wally Dug in Northumberland Street, and other brewers
such as Tennents continue to look for opportunities to add to their
estate in Edinburgh.
Along with the brewers a good percentage of pubs are owned by a small
number of private companies which have a sizable public house estate.
These include Caledonian Heritable, Thistle Inns, and Arrow Leisure.
These companies are always looking to expand their estate and will
purchase the right opportunities when they become available. Along with
the brewers and other private individuals, there is always likely to be
competition for any quality pub which comes on the market in Edinburgh.
Pubs at the smaller end of the price spectrum and on the outskirts of
Edinburgh are also attracting healthy interest and sales are being
achieved. Two examples in which we are involved are the Grey Horse in
Balerno and the Black Pig at Fountainbridge. The Grey Horse was sold by
ourselves on behalf of Ann Brow. She retired from the Grey Horse after
it had been owned by the family for 99 years. The pub was offered to the
market towards the end of March 1995 and a sale was agreed at a closing
date at the beginning of May for a figure in excess of the asking price
of #175,000.
We have recently been instructed to market the Black Pig at
Fountainbridge at a figure of #135,000 and already this has attracted
two notes of interest and is likely to be sold at a closing date.
For both Edinburgh hoteliers and publicans who are considering selling
their business, the market remains buoyant compared to other parts of
Scotland and England. Despite the continued talk of recession and lack
of confidence, which might be true for other parts of the economy, the
current position and the future remains healthy for hotel and pub owners
in Edinburgh. Good prices continue to be paid for quality units and
owners should seriously consider offering their businesses for sale and
take advantage of the positive market which currently prevails.

* GERMANY is set to stage its first world heavyweight title fight for
nearly 20 years with German Axel Schulz and South African Francois Botha
due to fight in November for the International Boxing Federation title
relinquished by George Foreman.
''We are close to an agreement. The will is there, '' Schulz's manager
Wilfried Sauerland said yesterday.
Sauerland, who held talks with Botha's manager Don King in London at
the weekend, added: ''I am expecting a fax from King in the next few
days with confirmation. We are unlikely to sign on it however for
another 10 to 14 days.''
Germany last held a heavyweight title bout in 1976 when Muhammad Ali
beat Britain's Richard Dunn. The Schulz-Botha fight is expected to take
place indoors in either Munich's Olympic arena or Dortmund's
Westfalenhalle.
Last April Schulz lost a controversial decision to 46-year-old Foreman
in a title bout in Las Vegas. Foreman, 46, was stripped of his crown
after he refused a mandatory rematch against the German.

EAMONN Loughran, the WBO welterweight champion, has threatened to pull
out of his fight with South African Luvuyo Kakaza unless the challenger
has an AIDS test.
Loughran is due to meet the Kakaza on August 5 at the Ulster Hall,
Belfast, but is wary about contracting the killer virus after reports
last week that a number of South African boxers have failed tests.
''I have been told that 34 professional boxers in South Africa have
failed an AIDS test and that causes me a lot of concern,'' said
Loughran.
''I have to know before I enter the ring that he is clear and I won't
fight unless he is tested for AIDS.''
British boxing was first hit by a similar scare when Colombian Reuben
Palicio was found to have the virus 48 hours before he challenged
Newcastle's John Davison for the WBO featherweight title in 1983.
Loughran, meanwhile, is in a determined mood, should the fight against
the South African go ahead.
''Kakaza says he is looking to take the title back to South Africa.
Well the only way he's doing that is if he shoots me and he'd better
hope I am dead. I just hope he is searched for a firearm before he
enters the ring,'' he said.

FOR the first time for 10 years, since the Scottish Open championship
was played at Haggs Castle, the West of Scotland is to have a PGA
European Tour event -- and that on a course, at the Loch Lomond club,
which is currently only in the second year of its playing existence.
The Loch Lomond World Invitational, it was announced yesterday, will
be inaugurated next year, from September 19 to 22 as a joint venture by
Carnegie Sports International and the co-owners of the club, the Lyle
Anderson Company, heavily involved in such developments in the United
States, and DMB, a privately-held American investment company.
A field restricted to 118 professionals (and three amateurs) will
compete for #750,000 over the Jay Morrish-Tom Weiskopf designed course
which from the championship tees will measure 7060 yards. Unusually, the
cut will come after 54, not 36 holes, and the 65 survivors and ties will
then pursue the #125,000 first prize in the final round.
The field will be made up of as many of the first 60 in the Sony World
Rankings as is possible, always bearing in mind that there will be a
conflicting event on the US Tour. There also will be 10 invited seniors,
five each from the European and US tours, who within the main event will
play for a one-off sum of #30,000.
The remaining places will be occupied by 10 sponsors' invitations and
others from among the leading professionals at the time. The idea of the
third-round cut is to make it possible for players well down the field
to improve their position with attacking golf which would provide more
entertainment for the paying customers.
Next year's tournament also will be a Ryder Cup points qualifying
event and in 1997 it is expected to be the final tournament before that
year's match between Europe and United States is played on the Continent
for the first time, at Valderrama in Southern Spain.
Ken Schofield, the tour's executive director, remarked: ''Our players
have been privately and publicly calling for quality tournaments on
quality courses and I expect their fullest support.'' This event is, by
the way, initially set to run for three years and with options to
continue.
Jim MacDonald, chairman of Carnegie, said of the tournament, which
will cost between #500,000 and #800,000 to stage: ''We are not dependent
on a title sponsor, but we expect that, given the quality of the event
and its location, interested parties will emerge. And we will not be
paying any players appearance money.''
On the question of access, involving traffic movement along the single
carriageway A82 Loch Lomond road and car parking at the site, Anderson
could say only non-committally: ''We are pretty confident we can handle
that. There is a generous amount of land nearby and good access is
possible.''
MacDonald, asked whether he could estimate an attendance figure,
responded: ''Well, we obviously don't expect spectators of the number of
the 180,000 at St Andrews for last week's Open championship, but we
think between 40,000 and 50,000.'' Police and the local authority will
gradually become involved.
Weiskopf, who won the 1973 Open championship at Troon and only three
weeks ago, aged 52, the USGA Senior title, will himself play in the
tournament. He said yesterday: ''Of the 31 courses I've been involved in
the design of this one is a giant step above the others. ''
Anderson said he expected the clubhouse, based in Rossdhu House to be
completed in 1997 and the planned second course, for which Jack Nicklaus
has already prepared the preliminary design, in two or three years.

William Russell reviews tales of a spooky friend, a womanising
baseball legend, and a latter-day Oscar Wilde
SOMETIMES a film can try too hard. On the face of it there is no
reason a mixture of animation, special effects, and live actors should
not be just the thing to bring Casper the friendly ghost to the screen.
It worked with Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
But Casper, is a strident, intermittently funny film which fails to
make full use of the talents of Bill Pullman or Christina Ricci, and for
all the time and 28 trillion bytes (equal to 19 million floppy disks),
used to create Casper, the old-fashioned cartoon figure was infinitely
better.
The makers claim their Casper is the first digital performer ever,
showing emotions one would expect of a real ghost. The trouble is that
Casper never was a real ghost, and when the film tries to turn him into
one by making ectoplasm flesh and showing us the little boy he once was
(Devon Sawa) things turn squeamish.
Family films are rare enough these days and Casper, directed by Brad
Silberling, is aimed squarely at the family market. Pre-teenage children
will probably enjoy it, although I doubt whether they will actually go
into raptures over Casper and his friends. Things, however, do start off
well.
An old miser dies, leaving his nasty daughter Carrigan (Cathy
Moriarty) not his fortune, but the derelict, haunted Whipstaff Manor.
She decides to bulldoze it, which upsets the resident ghosts, Stretch,
Stinkie, Fatso, and their nephew Casper, no end. Carrigan changes her
mind after discovering it might contain hidden pirate treasure and hires
a travelling ghost therapist, Dr James Harvey (Pullman), who has a
spunky little daughter, Kat (Ricci), to find it. Naturally the macabre
trio of uncles do their utmost to send the mortals packing.
Pullman mugs away effectively as a kindly charlatan, but the deadpan
gravity Ms Ricci made such effective use of in the two Addams Family
films as Wednesday, the homicidal daughter, is not required for Kat.
Here she is sugar and spice.
The opening pace seems to flag, and things are not helped by a notable
soupy score by James Horner.
There are times when one cannot escape some actors, and at the moment
Tommy Lee Jones seems to be all over the shop. After a somewhat drab
performance in Batman Forever, a rent-paying exercise if ever there was,
he comes up in Cobb, with the sort of barn-storming performance at which
he excels.
He plays America's most famous baseball player, Ty Cobb, the man who
apparently almost single-handedly created the modern game. But while a
sporting hero, he was also deeply flawed man, a wife beater, a racist, a
drunk, and a sadistic womaniser.
Cobb was living proof that sporting greatness is not next to human
godliness. The film opens in 1960 with the long-retired Cobb summoning a
sports journalist, Al Stump (Robert Wuhl) to his home to become his
ghost writer. We are then treated to the developing relationship between
the two men as Cobb insists Stump write a hagiography, and Stump in
secret writes the truth.
Jones gives a terrific peformance, with the climax, perhaps Cobb's one
moment of self-understanding, coming at a testimonial dinner when he is
shown a newsreel recounting his career and while watching it, drunk,
fantasises the truth in among the accolades -- wifebeating, child abuse,
alcoholicsm, drugs, violence and fraud.
Lolita Davidovitch plays a cheerful waitress who has the misfortune to
get picked up by Cobb and Stump -- she is involved in a hideous
near-rape scene -- and while it is a small role makes the most of her
chances. She is sassy and warm-hearted and the one decent human being in
sight.
In the end Stump cops out. Having behaved as if he were a man of
principle who would write it as it really was, and told by Cobb, who has
found his secret notes to do whatever he wants, he opts to print the
legend.
As a warts-and-all portrait of an all-American hero the film, directed
by Ron Shelton, who made Bull Durham, is a powerful piece of work, and,
given our own army of flawed sporting heroes -- no need for names, they
dominate the headlines day after day -- it is also topical.
Another actor who can chew the scenery when he wishes, Albert Finney,
turns in a remarkably restrained performance in A Man of No Importance.
Finney plays, Alfie Byrne, a good-natured Dublin bus conductor, who is
also a confirmed bachelor. Alfie lives with his sister (Brenda Fricker),
runs an amateur dramatic group with the regular passengers on his bus,
and is in love with his driver (Rufus Sewell), whom he calls Bosie.
Finney conveys the man's good-hearted nature perfectly, but is let down
by a whimsical script which persists in taking an infuriating sub-Ealing
comedy approach to a very human situation.
Alfie is a closet homosexual who has refused to recognise his
sexuality, hiding behind his admiration for Oscar Wilde, whose Salome he
is planning to put on with his drama group.
Michael Gambon, another scenery chewer when he feels like it, plays
the sister's friend, a bigotted butcher, who fulfils the function of the
Marquis of Queensberry when Alfie's shameful secret is finally revealed.
It is acted well enough, but Barry Devlin's script and Suri
Krishnamma's direction treat the painful reality of Alfie' situation --
he is meant to be a latter-day Oscar -- as if it were the stuff of
folksy comedy.

* BRITISH light-middleweight champion Robert McCracken is planning a
return to the ring in September to prepare for his European title bid.
Unbeaten McCracken, who will face European champion Laurent Boudouani
of France in October, has been sidelined since beating Mexico's Sergio
Medina in April after suffering from an infected tooth and is keen to
secure a warm-up bout.
He said: ''I am looking to have a 10-rounder in September, probably in
London. I'm already back in training and know that I have got a lot of
work to do with there being so much at stake.''
The title fight has gone out to purse offers with McCracken bracing
himself to have to travel to Paris for the contest.

AT last, Edinburgh appears to be getting it right. Historically
suffering from a lack of high quality grade A accommodation, there is
now a mini-development boom under way within the city and at South Gyle.
In 1991 Saltire Court was developed by Scottish Metropolitan and was
let in the majority to existing Edinburgh occupiers, such as Shepherd &amp;
Wedderburn, Dundas &amp; Wilson, Martin Currie Investment Managers and KPMG
Peat Marwick McClintock. Since then, there has been little, if any, of
this quality of accommodation available in the Edinburgh market.
Now, we have a major ongoing development programme around Lothian
Road/Western Approach Road and at South Gyle to the west of the city.
At Lothian Road, Standard Life are constructing a new headquarters
building, extending to approximately 330,000 sq ft.
Scottish Widows have obtained planning consent for a new headquarters
of approximately 450,000 sq ft on the former Port Hamilton site and
Cala/Morrison, pre-funded by Railways Pension Trustees, are shortly to
go on site with phase one of ''The Exchange'', a 90,000 sq ft
development with floor plates of up to 17,000 sq ft and incorporating a
restaurant. Phase two will provide a further 100,000 sq ft linking in
with Exchange Square and the rear of the conference centre.
As a result, the traditional office location in Edinburgh is
concentrating back into St Andrew Square/Charlotte Square and along
Melville Street, with the streets around the New Town and West End
reverting to residential.
Larger transactions last year were mainly relocations including Touche
Ross's move to Gracemount's 39/41 George Street, subsequently purchased
by the Crown Estate and Scottish Provident's acquisition of part of the
CIS development at 7/11 Melville Street.
The other development boom occurring in the city is to the west, where
the development of Edinburgh Park, New Edinburgh Limited, a joint
venture between Edinburgh Development and Investment and the Miller
Group, have secured a number of new occupiers including Scottish
Equitable, ICL and John Menzies.
Scottish Equitable's 300,000 sq ft headquarters is due for completion
in early 1996 and the buildings for ICL and John Menzies are due for
completion in the autumn of this year.
The developers are progressing with Lochside Court, a speculative
development in two buildings totalling some 25,000 sq ft, and again
early enquiries are being achieved for a minimum of 3000 sq ft.
Associated with this will be the development of the ''Park Centre'', a
leisure facility providing a health and fitness club and a limited
amount of retail and this is due for completion in early 1996.

THE Edinburgh office market is showing definite signs of improvement
following the effects of recession. While the market still has some way
to go, there are signs of increased activity in both the open plan and
the converted townhouse market.
Edinburgh faces a short-term shortage of quality open plan floor
space, in the centre and on the outskirts of the city.
Total supply of floor space recently calculated by Ryden indicated a
total supply of approximately 1.63m sq ft (151,431 sq m). Representing
some 9% of the total estimated stock of 18m sq ft (1,672,240 sq m).
However, a more detailed analysis of the supply figures reveals that a
high proportion of the available stock comprises older cellular
accommodation, or poorly specified, often poorly located, 1960s/early
1970s buildings which require refurbishment/redevelopment prior to their
being re-occupied. When this is taken into account, the availability
level drops to some 6%.
Considerable bespoke office development is presently being undertaken
by major organisations in the city including Standard Life, Scottish
Widows, Scottish Equitable, ICL, John Menzies, Scottish &amp; Newcastle and
the Scottish Office at Victoria Quay, Leith. In all, these developments
account for an additional 1.25m sq ft (116,128 sq m) of office stock
within the city.
Take up of speculative office accommodation (excluding bespoke
development) has averaged some 600,000 sq ft (55,741 sq m) per annum
over the last 10 years. However, take up for the 12 months to March 1,
1995, was 765,000 sq ft (71,070 sq m), proof that demand is indeed
improving.
The only new open plan speculative city centre office developments
available, or completing this year, in units greater than 30,000 sq ft,
include Trafalgar House development at 7 Castle Street, 39,490 sq ft
(3256 sq m) and Conference House 30,500 sq ft (2,833 sq m). Clarendon
House, a new development undertaken by Equitable Life comprising 34,400
sq ft (3196 sq m) is now ready for immediate occupation.
On the periphery of the city, following the successful letting of
phase one of Pentland Gait 35,500 sq ft to McQueen, EDI are well
advanced with phase two of this development which will comprise
approximately 26,750 sq ft (2485 sq m) in two buildings of 11,850 sq ft
(1100 sq m) and 14,900 sq ft (1384 sq m).
In addition New Edinburgh are building a speculative 30,000 sq ft
(2787 sq m) at Edinburgh Park. Due to a number of active office
requirements at the present time for offices in the 10 to 20,000 sq ft
bracket, which require to be accommodated by late 1995/early 1996, it is
likely a competitive situation could develop in these peripheral
locations such as South Gyle and Leith. If parties can wait for
accommodation to be built, then the situation is not quite so critical.

AN UNUSUAL opportunity for small Glasgow firms to buy their own
offices in the city centre has been revealed.
A prominent building at the corner of West Regent Street and Renfield
Street is being redeveloped and will be sold as small offices ranging in
size from 1500 sq ft upwards. Strategically located opposite the Odeon
cinema, the 55,000 sq ft Castle Chambers has been empty since it was
damaged by a fire in April 1992.
''The building is being acquired by the Glasgow-based Donaldson Group,
who are in detailed discussion with both the current owners and the
Local Authority,'' says marketing agent Richie Webster of surveyors
Griffin Webster.
''They are close to reaching an agreement which would safeguard the
future of this landmark.''
The Donaldson Group propose to refurbish and reinstate the fabric of
the main building and to upgrade the common service core. Suites or
individual floors will then be sold off.
''Firms which are fed up paying rentals could find this a very
interesting proposition,'' says Webster. ''A small partnership could buy
their own offices then buy out each partner's share as he or she reaches
retirement, thus providing their own in-house pension scheme and
removing the uncertainty of future rent reviews.''
The idea of local businesses or partnerships owning their own slice of
freehold is not a new concept, but the opportunity does not arise very
often. The agents are targeting the scheme at solicitors, accountants,
insurance brokers and similar enterprises.
Each buyer can fit out their own premises to their own standards. The
developer will provide a new entrance and the common areas such as
stairs and lift will be fitted out to a high quality.
''It means that buyers won't have to accept a customised unit, they
can make their offices as basic or as prestigious as they like,'' says
Webster.
Suites could be available from 1340 sq ft to 5000 sq ft and the
development should be ready for occupation from the middle of next year.

KERRY Packer's bid to lure Britain's star players into a multi-million
pound professional circus has come under attack from top officials in
Wales and Scotland. Rugby Football Union chiefs meet with England's
leading players today in a bid to persuade Will Carling and Co that
their futures do not lie with Packer, who is said to be willing to pay
900 players up to #130,000 per year.
There were also claims that the new circus would be played in the
traditional rugby union stadiums of the world -- including Murrayfield.
But Scottish RU vice-president and IB representative Freddie McLeod
said: ''I can categorically deny that Murrayfield -- nor any other
Scottish club ground -- will be used for this project. We are requesting
our clubs not to offer their facilities.''

WORLD champion Michael Schumacher has welcomed Damon Hill's suggested
pre-race public gesture of reconciliation at this weekend's German grand
prix.
Hill, who has been embroiled in a war of words with his German rival
in recent weeks, suggested yesterday that the two drivers go on a lap of
the circuit in the same vintage car during the drivers' parade before
the race.
Normally drivers from the same team sit or stand together in the cars
but Schumacher, who was involved in a controversial crash with Hill at
the British Grand Prix earlier this month, accepted Hill's offer of a
public end to the feud. ''I will accept Hill's outstretched hand. That
shows his understanding that he was responsible for the crash at
Silverstone,'' said Schumacher.
''The idea is a good way to dampen the emotions of the fans. The
matter will then be over as far as I'm concerned.''

MARTINA Navratilova insists she will play her eagerly-awaited
exhibition match against Monica Seles on Saturday -- despite aggravating
a groin injury.
''Although I do have a groin injury and am not used to being injured,
I do heal very quickly and fully intend to play in Atlantic City,'' said
Navratilova.
MICHELE Mair beat Berkshire's Kaye Hand 6-1, 6-1 in yesterday's
opening round of the $25,000 Challenger event in Istanbul and now meets
fifth seed Emmanuelle Gagliardi of Monaco.
Ross Mathison and Andrew Richardson lost their opening doubles match
in the Northern Electric Open 6-3, 6-3 to Israeli qualifiers Jonathan
Ehrlich and Nir Welgreen yesterday.
BRITISH junior champion Luke Milligan clinched a surprise 6-4, 3-6,
6-3 victory over top seed Henrik Holm in the Northern Electric Open in
Newcastle yesterday. The Brighton-based 18-year-old, playing only his
second challenger tournament, will now face No. 8 seed David Nainkin of
South Africa in the quarter-finals.
Another British hope, Colin Beecher failed to make any further impact,
losing in straight sets to Mahesh Bhupathi. Beecher, from Kent,
struggled to cope with Indian Bhupathi's ground strokes and went down
7-5, 6-4.
THE International Tennis Federation has confirmed it is seeking to set
up a men's professional tour in competition with the ATP Tour circuit --
with Rupert Murdoch reported as being a possible partner.

MIKE Tyson is bidding to upstage Riddick Bowe and Evander Holyfield by
announcing he will fight in Las Vegas on the same day as his heavyweight
rivals.
While promoters were preparing yesterday's announcement of the
Bowe-Holyfield fight at Caesars Palace, Tyson's manager, John Horne,
revealed that his former world champion would be in action just down the
road at the MGM Grand hotel-casino on the same night.
Horne refused to identify Tyson's opponent, but possibilities include
former champion Michael Dokes and Lou Savarese.
A bullish Horne said: ''Mike Tyson has his dates; they can move their
dates. Bowe-Holyfield is a good attraction, but right now the biggest
attraction is what Mike Tyson does.
''Who cares who wins or loses? It's not even for anything. The people
are eager, hungry to see Mike Tyson.''
WBO champion Bowe's manager, Rock Newman, however, said there was no
comparison between the two fights.
He said: ''They're attempting to serve the people dog biscuits. We're
serving filet mignon on November the fourth.''
Tyson signed a six-fight TV contract for his series of comeback bouts
shortly after being released from prison in March. His first fight will
be against Peter McNeeley on August 19.

AT THE halfway stage of the series, England find themselves still
unsettled and with a mountain to climb.
With the series standing at 2-1 in favour of the tourists and just
three Tests to go, England have yet to find a combination which has even
a semblance of permanency. The brief feeling of rejuvenation after the
Lord's victory disappeared rapidly with the fiasco at Edgbaston.
The injury situation has not helped matters and even though the
bone-scan and X-ray on fast bowler Darren Gough's injured foot gave him
the all-clear and he had a good workout yesterday, there is doubt over
his inclusion, even if he is fully fit.
His fast bowling, which promised so much for England since his most
impressive entry on the international scene last summer, has produced
just six wickets in three Tests against the Windies, at an average of
42.50. His cavalier style of batting currently gives him an average of
only 12.16.
Illingworth may take this as an opportunity, particularly after the
injury scare, to rest the swashbuckling Yorkshireman. But that still has
not reopened the door for Devon Malcolm.
The final XI selected today could possibly include three off-spinners.
With the recall of veteran John Emburey and the inclusion of Graeme Hick
and Lancashire's captain Mike Watkinson in the squad, the three finger
spinners will be looking for the rough from the bowlers' footmarks when
bowling to left-handers Lara, Adams, and Arthurton.
If Hick, who is short of Test runs this summer apart from his 67 at
Lord's, is left out, the No.3 batting spot goes to John Crawley, and
Australian-bred Yorkshireman Craig White would bat at No.6. He will also
be required to provide spells of seam bowling, especially if Gough were
absent. More importantly, higher up the batting order, England will be
hoping for a solid start from Mike Atherton and debutant Nick Knight.
Groundsman Peter Marron's pitch looks a good cricketing surface. It's
going to be hard, as West Indian coach Andy Roberts pointed out, and
although not exceptionally quick, it will have a consistent bounce. Fast
bowler Ian Bishop, one of the heroes of West Indies' third Test triumph,
said the wicket looked better than those at Lord's and Edgbaston. There
is just enough grass on it to hold the cracks together but the spinners
are unlikely to find any prodigious turn in the wicket. However, a
bowler of Emburey's experience and guile is likely to keep it tight.
This season he has been in splendid form.
The tourists have been free from injury problems. Curtly Ambrose, who
bowled just seven overs at Edgbaston, is fully fit. But, despite good
knocks by others, their main worry remains the lack of runs from master
batsman Brian Lara.
Tour match -- Young Australia 262-4 (S G Law 76no, M T G Elliott 51);
Gloucestershire 265-8 (M W Alleyne 102no, A Symonds 50). At Cheltenham.
Gloucestershire won by two wickets.

SCOTLAND all-rounder Mike Allingham is out of today's Euro Triangular
Tournament opener against Holland at Myreside. The Heriot's man
aggravated an old groin strain while batting for Edinburgh against
Northumbria at the weekend.
He said: ''I'm having treatment and, with a bit of luck, I'll be okay
for Saturday's game with Denmark on Saturday.''
Freuchie's Scott Gourlay, who won his first cap in the rain-ruined
encounter with Ireland on Thursday, has been recalled for the Dutch
match.
Meanwhile, Scotland B had a last-ball victory over Holland at
Goldenacre last night.
The B side looked all set as they reached the final over needing just
two runs to win. However, skipper Stuart Kennedy was clean-bowled by the
opening delivery, and Roddy Smith was out next ball. But Neil MacCrae
dashed in for the winning run off the last ball.
Former A-team skipper Ally Storie and Bryn Lockie had paved the way
with an opening stand of 169 before Storie holed out at point for 85.
West Indian veteran Nolan Clarke had hit a quickfire 75 for the Dutch
before becoming one of Gourlay's three victims.
Holland 244 (N Clarke 75, S Lubbers 55; S Gourlay 3-47); Scotland B
245-5 (B Lockie 88, A Storie 85, N MacCrae 36no).
* TOP batting form enabled Scotland to stave off defeat by Wales on
the second day of the Under-19 clash in Abergavenny, where skipper
Dougie Lockhart and Stuart Moffat each hit a superb century. Scores:
Wales 362-9 dec and 63-2; Scotland 314-5 dec (D Lockhart 111, S Moffat
106, N McCallum 36).
Welsh Schools Cricket Association Under-15s 188 (M Howell 31; J Blain
5-61) and 0-0; Scottish Young Cricketers Under-16s 235-6 dec (G Pitt 70,
F Watt 53, A Gul 40; H Williams 3-59).

SHAUN Lynch, a 33-year-old recreational golfer, may have earned a spot
in the record books with a 496-yard hole-in-one.
He hit a No.3 iron off the tee on Monday at the par-5 dogleg
seventeenth hole at the Teign Valley Golf Club, near Exeter, in
southwest England.
Lynch cut the dogleg by driving over a 20-foot hedge. The shot bounced
down the steep fairway and rolled all the way into the cup.
''I had no idea where it had gone,'' Lynch said. ''It must have
bounced on the hard ground and run and run. At 6ft 2ins and 203 pounds I
can whack the ball a long way and obviously hit this one just right.''
Lynch assumed his ball was lost and even played a provisional second
tee shot. But the original ball was discovered by one of his two playing
partners when they reached the green and lifted the flag out of the
hole.
According to the Guinness Book of Records, the previous longest
hole-in-one on a dogleg came in 1962 at the 480-yard fifth at the Hope
Country Club in Arkansas.

IN HIS letter on July 19 R David Ker was correct in saying that
shooting and fishing play vital roles in the rural economy. It is
imperative, however, that these activities do not take place to the
detriment of birds of prey. Attempts by game preservers legally to
control raptors such as peregrines and hen harriers must be resisted.
It was not long ago that these species were virtually extinct in
Britain because of persecution by gamekeepers. At the start of the
present century, for example, the few hen harriers still surviving were
confined to the Orkney Islands. This was scarcely surprising when
historical records reveal that on two Ayrshire estates 351 hen harriers
were killed between June 1850 and November 1854.
Recolonisation of the mainland only began after the Second World War
because most keepers were away on military service and fewer were
employed because of economic restrictions after the cessation of the
conflict. Hen harrier populations continued to increase as a consequence
of legal protection.
Sadly, despite the provision of harsh penalties for offenders, the hen
harrier is still illegally persecuted because it is regarded as the main
raptorial enemy of moorland grouse. Because it nests on the ground and
flies boldly towards intruders the harrier is an easy victim at its
breeding sites for nest raiders or people with guns. It is estimated
there are just 500 to 700 pairs of hen harriers in Britain, with the
majority located in Scotland. If legal protection were relaxed, the
population of this elegant bird would decline to dangerously low levels
once again.
The peregrine is in a similar category. At the turn of the present
century the population numbered about 700 pairs throughout Britain but
concentrated mainly in Scotland and North-west England.
Systematic persecution by game preservers, egg collectors, and
falconers, along with the ravages of organo-chlorine pesticides and an
extermination campaign by the wartime Government because peregrines were
attacking messenger pigeons, saw the population decline to just 68
breeding pairs in 1962.
Round about that period pigeon-racing enthusiasts were, like game
preservers today, complaining that there were too many peregrines and
that the raptors were seriously affecting their sport. A Home
Office-initiated project involving Nature Conservancy and the British
Trust for Ornithology showed that, far from increasing, peregrine
populations were at an all-time low. It was decided that more, not less,
protection was required for predatory birds such as peregrines.
Consequently, the population now numbers around 730 pairs.
Unfortunately, despite the penalty provisions of legislation such as
the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, peregrines, like hen harriers,
are still illegally persecuted. Some have been poisoned by bait laced
with the lethal alphachloralose chemical. Others have been shot at, or
in the vicinity of, their eyries on cliff faces. Others have had their
eggs and young stolen or destroyed. My own local peregrine nest is
regularly raided. This year a tiercel (male peregrine) was found shot
dead on top of two addled eggs in the nest. Similar incidents have
previously occurred. The finger of suspicion points in definite
directions but nothing can be proved.
Game preservers, landowners, and moor managers should refrain from
demanding the relaxation of the laws protecting birds of prey, otherwise
they may find a groundswell of public opinion directed against shooting,
despite its importance to the rural economy.
Species such as peregrines and hen harriers symbolise the recovery of
nature from the brink of extinction. They embody the majestic spirit of
the wild places. They are entitled to their present levels of
protection.
Derek Parker is a professional countryside ranger. He has been
involved in raptor protection for many years.

Under 25-Championship
THE upturn in fortunes of Hilton Park professional Stewart Russell
continued apace yesterday. He assumed the halfway lead in the Scottish
Under-25s championship at Westerwood as high winds blew the majority of
competitors off course.
The 24-year-old posted a level-par 73 to move in front of his joint
overnight leader, Guy Redford of Turnberry, and partly attributed his
improved performances this season to a putting exercise offered by
leading woman amateur Catherine Divers.
''I putt cack-handed and she suggested hitting 100 putts using my
right hand only,'' said Russell, who rued a triple bogey 6 at the 170
yard-fifteenth. Still nursing a slight ankle sprain, Russell made amends
by rolling in four birdie putts across slick putting surfaces.
The leader also praised the course which has come in for harsh
criticism during past Tartan Tour events. He added: ''The course has
improved immensely over the last year.''
Redford, another successful Scottish product of Midland College in
Texas, produced a one-over-par 74, the third lowest score of the day.
Only invited amateur Grant Campbell, of Airdrie, and Steven Rosie of
Glenbervie broke par from a field of 134. Leading scores, *denotes

Harare, Wednesday
ZIMBABWEAN sports officials forced photographers off a football pitch
today to shield scandal-plagued Southampton goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar
from the press during a training session.
''They grabbed my cameras and pushed me off the pitch,'' said one
photographer.
Grobbelaar had earlier arrived at Harare airport where officials
whisked him away from a side entrance to escape the waiting media.
Zimbabwean immigration authorities said they planned to find out
whether Grobbelaar held dual citizenship, which is illegal.
''We want to establish if he has restored his British citizenship. If
he has, it means he has forfeited his Zimbabwean citizenship. He would
no longer be a Zimbabwean,'' said an immigration officer.
Grobbelaar, charged on Monday with conspiracy related to match-fixing,
is in Harare to prepare for Zimbabwe's African nations cup qualifier
with Cameroon on Sunday.
The press was barred from the training session at the national sports
stadium.
Questions about Grobbelaar's citizenship arose after he surrendered
two passports, one Zimbabwean and another British, when he was
questioned by Hampshire police in March in relation to the match-fixing
charges, which he denies.
Zimbabwe abolished dual citizenship in 1985 when Grobbelaar won
British citizenship, and so lost his Zimbabwean citizenship. He
renounced his British citizenship in 1992 to regain Zimbabwean
citizenship.--Reuter.

AMONG the hundred and one details to be attended to in the fraught
months before a wedding, the most emotionally charged must the purchase
of the bridal gown. All other matters pale into insignificance when it
comes to the bride's gown; the one item which will, she believes, make
or break her big day more than the setting, the weather and the food at
the reception.
Choice of gowns and styles has never been better but many in the
bridal industry are increasingly recognising that the atmosphere in
which a bride can peruse her choices and weigh up what is right for her
is crucial. There has always been an emphasis in bridal salons on luxury
and comfort, but in Scotland this has reached its apex with the recent
opening of Julia Herbert Bridal Design, four storeys of Georgian
elegance on the edge of Glasgow's West End.
In January Tom and Moira Pearson opened in Royal Crescent what they
are calling, with some justification, the Bridal House of Scotland,
after last year going through the travails of their daughter's wedding.
While everything was alright on the day of their daughter Julia's
marriage to Captain Herbert, buying the dress had been a difficult
experience in a crowded salon full of customers.
Tom Pearson said: ''I had these emotionally drained women coming home
to me and the message which was coming over was that buying the gown was
not a pleasurable experience. I kept hearing how Scotland needed a
bridal house, so I thought there must be something to it.''
His wife Moira added: ''Buying a bridal gown is a very important
occasion for a bride-to-be and her mother and they should be able to
enjoy it in pleasant surroundings.''
Bolstered by 30 and more years of experience in the retail sector, the
Pearsons have now plunged into the bridal business with Tom at the
management helm and Moira providing a keen eye on the bridal fashion
front with a wide range of attractive gowns, many exclusive to them
within Scotland, from designers such as David Fielden and Lyn Lundie and
respected bridal manufacturers such as Sposa Bella.
On arrival at the white former townhouse in Royal Crescent clients are
being shown into the salon's opulent entrance way with chaise longues,
gilt mirrors and baroque ornamentation offset by soft dusky pink thick
carpets and patterned walls. Certainly Julia Herbert Bridal Design -- a
name borrowed from their inspiration for the venture -- is redolent of a
bygone time of elegance when ladies of social standing would be feted
and clothed by couturiers in private salons.
On the first floor are two salons, showcasing outfits for the mother
of the bride, guests and gowns for more informal or second-time around
weddings, with the second dedicated to bridesmaids, pages and flower
girls. On the second floor is the unrivalled luxury of the brides' gowns
salon with natural light flooding in the huge front windows.
A groom's section, decorated in more masculine tones, is in the
basement area with gentlemen encouraged to go into the building at the
back where the car park with spaces for eight or more cars is located.
Space, Roberta Buchan, admits is at a premium in her two-floor salon
in Glasgow's Hope Street, but she also believes providing the right kind
of environment for brides choosing their gowns is essential. Said
Roberta: ''The salon is a bit like the tardis, expanding and shrinking
with our needs.''
Redecoration of some form takes place on an ongoing basis to keep the
premises fresh and the downstairs section was recently re-juggled to
provide additional changing rooms. The personal touch however remains
crucial. ''Our staff are superb,''said Roberta. ''They have created a
genuinely warm atmosphere in which brides-to-be can relax.''
Establishing a rapport is vital for bridal designers, such as Joyce
Stewart, of Sew Exclusive who creates gowns from directions given by her
clients. Said Joyce: ''It is of paramount importance that the bride is
happy. As a designer it can be too easy to get carried away with
creative ideas and forget you are designing for an individual who may or
may not be able to carry off the dress. To get it right means creating
an environment in which brides can relax and can talk one-to-one.''
After establishing the right kind of atmosphere, Joyce then tries to
find out about a bride's likes and dislikes without getting too
personal. It is a balancing act, but one she believes is very important
to delivering a dress which will be right for the bride and her
personality.

Union, Wednesday
SUSAN SMITH'S older brother told jurors today that his family has
already been devastated by her drowning of her two little boys and would
only be further harmed if she were executed for the murders.
As 23-year-old Smith's lawyers began their final bid to avoid a
possible death sentence, Scotty Vaughan said his sister never lost her
temper with three-year-old Michael or 14-month-old Alex and showed every
sign of being a normal mother in the days before the killings.
''I don't think Susan knew what she was doing. The Susan I know just
could never have done this and the Susan that I know was not at the lake
that night,'' said the 33-year-old father of two boys during about an
hour of sobbing testimony.
When defence lawyer David Bruck asked if, as prosecutors claim, Smith
was capable of planning the murders in order to salvage an adulterous
love affair, Vaughan answered with a resolute ''Never!''
The Smith case gripped the nation for nine days last year after the
former secretary told police the boys had been abducted by a carjacker
on the night of October 25. She ultimately admitted rolling her car down
a boat ramp into John D Long Lake with the boys strapped in the rear
seat.
Vaughan recounted in detail the night nine days later, when relatives
and friends gathered at his mother's home learned on television that
Smith had admitted to drowning her children.
''I can't remember ever seeing that much sadness and that much
heartache and so many people crying at one time. I'll never forget that
night,'' he said in a halting, agonised tone.
''We've been devastated already with the loss of Michael and Alex and
the fact that Susan was involved in that. But it seems so sad and ironic
that the tragedy of their loss is going to be used to send Susan to
death.''
Smith has been convicted on two counts of first-degree murder. The
trial is now in its penalty phase, during which the jury must decide
whether the former secretary should die for her crime.
If sentenced to death, Smith would face execution by lethal injection
but could opt to end her life in the state's electric chair. However,
anything less than a unanimous jury vote for the death penalty would
automatically remand her to life in prison without the possibility of
parole for 30 years.
Vaughan's testimony appeared intended to counter testimony by the
boys' grief-stricken father, David Smith, who took the witness stand as
a prosecution witness yesterday.
David Smith's two-hour testimony about how the boys' death had ended
his dreams drew tears from at least three jurors, members of the press,
and others in the packed courtroom.
Earlier today, prosecutors wound up their case by showing the jury
graphic crime scene photographs of Susan Smith's car with the bodies of
her little boys still strapped inside.--Reuter.

THE odious Bosnian Serbs have become the supermen of international
diplomacy. This is not because of any inherent talent but because of the
rampant stupidity of Nato and the United Nations. Consider the evidence.
Last week the London conference huffed and puffed and produced a
mighty-sounding ultimatum for the Serbs. Lay one finger on Gorazde,
indeed even think about laying a finger on it, and the response from the
major powers would be terrible. This was seen as something of a triumph
in London, we believe. Last night came the news that everyone, except
the participants in the London conference, had expected. The Russians
have won agreement from the Bosnian Serbs not to attack Gorazde.
Meanwhile the Bosnian Serbs, with simple and lucid common sense,
continued their attacks yesterday against the Bihac pocket and towards
Velika Kladusa and Vinograc and other places in-between. As if to
underline the paucity of the UN's policy, news emerged yesterday that Mr
Malcolm Rifkind had confirmed that the threats of a substantial and
decisive response to Serb attacks referred specifically to Gorazde.
The United States is believed to be unhappy with this situation, and
little wonder. Although some US actions in Bosnia have been devious in
the extreme, any pressure from Washington to force a change in the
''Gorazde only'' policy would be welcome and logical. Another absurdity
concerns the British troops on Mount Igman who are there together with
French troops as part of the tough policy towards the Bosnian Serbs. It
is possible, even likely, that they will be involved in heavy fighting.
Why, then, does the British contingent wear blue helmets and operate
with guns painted a glaring white, while the French troops are sensibly
camouflaged? Another absurdity presses for inclusion in this sorry list.
The Serbian leader in Belgrade, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, won recognition
and approval because of his arms and fuel embargo against his fellow
Serbs in Bosnia. He believed this would bring a full relaxation in
sanctions against Bosnia, but this has not happened. It is at least
reasonable to ask why, in the course of widespread military activity and
successful assaults in recent days, the Bosnian Serbs do not appear to
be suffering in the slightest degree from shortages of weapons or fuel.
Perhaps Mr Milosevic's halo has slipped. It is clear the current UN
stance is no more effective than any of its predecessors. Credibility
can only be restored if the tough talking in London applies everywhere
in Bosnia, and this must be made clear immediately.

JOHN Daly told yesterday how his dad Jim had to break the speed limit
to see him win the Open Championship for the first time.
At the very moment Costantino Rocca holed that 50-foot putt at St
Andrews to force a play-off, all the power failed in Daly's home town of
Dardanelle, Arkansas, because of a rain storm.
It meant none of the 4000 Americans who live there could watch the
first two holes on television as the former US PGA champion went
head-to-head with the Italian.
Daly said: ''My mum Lou and dad drove 30 miles to my aunt's house. It
is probably the first time they have broken the speed limit. The whole
town were going nuts when the power failed.''
Daly, a reformed alcoholic, has stayed in Europe to play in the
Heineken Dutch Open, which starts at Hilversum today, and the
Scandinavian Masters in Sweden next week.
He has been paired with Colin Montgomerie, who missed the cut in the
Open, and defending champion Miguel Angel Jimenez, from Spain.

Jerusalem, Wednesday
ISRAEL'S faltering peace talks with Syria were spared a potentially
fatal blow today, as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's governing coalition
narrowly defeated a Bill that sought to block a return of the Golan
Heights.
The Bill would have required a special parliamentary majority to
approve any land-for-peace deal, making it difficult for the government
to promise a full Golan withdrawal.
Officials said its rejection spared Israel from being portrayed as the
cause of a breakdown in the talks.
''If the law had passed there would have been a sigh of relief in
Damascus,'' said Rabin. ''A sigh of relief meaning -- 'Not only are we
to blame for holding up the peace process, but Israel'.''
The four-year talks became bogged down again this month, when American
envoy Dennis Ross failed to secure Syrian agreement to further meetings
between Syrian and Israeli military officers.
Rabin has never publicly accepted Syria's demand for a total return of
the Golan, captured in 1967 and annexed in 1981. However officials have
hinted that Israel may agree to it in exchange for full economic and
diplomatic ties and extensive security guarantees.
Right-wing lawmakers argued the 59-59 vote, while enough to repel the
Bill, showed Rabin lacked a majority for such a deal.
''It demonstrates very clearly that the government cannot muster a
majority'' for a Golan pull-out, said Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the
opposition Likud party.
The widespread unease over such a withdrawal was reflected in the
decision by three members of Rabin's own Labour Party to break ranks and
support the Bill. One of them, former Brigadier General Avigdor
Kahalani, is a war hero famed for his defence of the Golan in the 1973
war who has led a public campaign against a withdrawal.
The vote followed days of intense lobbying as both sides tried to win
over undecided MPs.
The Bill would have required a majority of 70 in the 120-member
Knesset, or the support of 51% of Israel's eligible voters in a
referendum, to approve any Golan withdrawal.
In another development today, armed Israelis fired shots into the air
and stoned cars outside the Jerusalem home of Faisal Husseini, the top
PLO official in Jerusalem. He was home at the time but no-one was hurt.
Three Jewish men were later arrested.--AP.

I WOULD like to break my self-imposed promise not to respond to John R
Stephen's spiteful outpourings against the police service in order to
reply to his latest slur on every police officer in Scotland (July 25).
The Sheehy Inquiry was not set up because of public disquiet about
some alleged miscarriages of justice; that inquiry's remit was entirely
a financial and remuneration exercise.
In view of some of Mr Stephen's other erroneous statements, it is not
surprising that he misleads in this way. Never let a good fact, it
seems, get in the way of a snide dig at the occupation which provided
his salary for many years and, incidentally, provides him with a pension
now.
He cites in support for his arguments an ancestor who allegedly was
secretary of the Scottish Police Federation but who does not appear on
the records as such.
Misquotes and selective quotations pepper his every bitter letter.
Time and time again he lets slip the opportunity to tell us exactly what
his axe is to grind.
Never has he taken up my invitation to outline his own police
experience, nor has he even deigned to indicate if he even was a serving
police officer, although he is very quick to produce uncles and
grandfathers. One has to wonder what he is up to.
I have laid my cards on the table, so to speak, from the very
beginning of this correspondence. John R Stephen has side-stepped every
time -- misquoted Herald journalists, missing Police Federation
secretaries, the red herrings of ex-police ancestors in Shanghai, and as
yet no real indication of what qualifies him to make unsubstantiated
allegations about the characters of each and every police officer whom
he tars with the brush of dishonest conduct.
Are we to believe that he completed his period of service with the
police as the only honest and truthful cop in honourable service so
soured him that he cannot write reasonably and sensibly about police
matters without dragging the tone down to mere abuse and distracting
anecdotes?

MAY I congratulate Stewart Lamont on his article about the
Compassionate Society, with regard to his remarks particularly anent the
legal system?
''The slurping gravy train for lawyers has made the price of justice
too high . . . '' and I would stop there.
And also his remarks regarding the really alarming news that 7000
criminal prosecutions were abandoned because of lack of time or
resources in Glasgow District Court.
One repeatedly gets the impression that the whole legal and so-called
justice system is stage-managed and run for the benefit of the legal
system and those who operate it, and not for the good of society or
those who are the innocent and ignorant victims of injustice and crime.
The whole system seems to be in great need of a far more thoroughgoing
and radical revision than the present tinkering we hear about -- being
carried out by lawyers.

BANKNOTE paper producer and printer De La Rue yesterday told
shareholders that its order book remained below the levels of recent
years.
Chairman Lord Limerick said: ''Our orders received for banknotes are
higher in the first three months of this year than in the same period
last year, but the outstanding order book still remains below the high
levels of recent years.
''We have received a number of inquiries which, if confirmed, could be
produced and sold during the current financial year.''
He said the group remained pleased with the acquisition of Portals,
the banknote paper company.
''Demand for security paper remains strong and the large new paper
machine, PM3, is on schedule to start production in early 1996.''
The group's payment systems division had a disappointing start to the
year but should see profit growth for the full year.
''Although we are expecting growth in operating profit for the first
half of this year, this will not be reflected in an increase in earnings
per share.''

IN your leading article, Nigeria's iron fist (July 20), you propose
two ways to curb General Abacha's repressive regime, namely, expulsion
from the Commonwealth and an embargo on Nigeria's oil exports.
As important, and perhaps more direct, would be to stop the sale of
British arms to Nigeria, including so-called non-lethal military
equipment.
This is the aim of current lobbying of MPs and MEPs by the World
Development Movement, a leading campaign group on Third World issues.
This campaign deserves support from those concerned with justice and

FIELD MARSHAL Lord Bramall suggested recently that Gurkha troops
should be sent to Bosnia. They come from a mountainous country, Nepal,
and are trained in mountain warfare.
At the back of the field marshal's mind may be the second battle of
Cassino in 1944. The German artillery were silenced over a period of
weeks by French native troops, named Gouns. The tactic was for the Gouns
to crawl to German rest positions and await gun crew personnel returning
from the gun position. A large knife appeared from nowhere and a German
head came off.
The same job could be done by the Gurkha with his kukri. Not many
Serbs would fire guns into Sarajevo after some beheading had taken
place.
Those in this nation who would shout against the use of the Kukri had
better pay a visit to Bosnia to witness ethnic cleansing in which men,
women, and children are shot like dogs.
Two Muslem battalions of infantry should also be sent from India or
Pakistan, plus a battery of mountain artillery using mules. They can
move quietly at night and surprise the Serbs.
To finish this war (for war it is going to be) quickly, the Geneva
Convention must be pushed to one side -- no quarter should be given and
none should be expected.
If the British Government cannot stomach such tactics then there
should be an immediate withdrawal. In future if there are civil wars the
UN should use German, Japanese, and Korean troops. These nations have
copied Britain and America in manufacturing motor cars and in building
ships etc.
It is time they copied peace-keeping duties.

A REPORT from the think-tank of agricultural experts set up by former
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave has described the European
Union's Common Agricultural Policy as too expensive, too bureaucratic,
and lacking in an appreciation of environmental needs.
It calls for the wholesale removal of production-orientated farm
subsidies and the creation of a rural support framework based on
environmental and socio-structural methods.
Unveiling the report yesterday, Mr Waldegrave's successor, Douglas
Hogg, described it as an important contribution to the debate on the
future of the CAP ''which is bound to change''.
He added: ''I believe it to be irresponsible not to warn that change
is inevitable and to aim to work out now the principles on which future
policy should be based.''
He accepted he was at odds with the EU Farm Commissioner, Franz
Fischler, who has gone on record as saying that the MacSharry reforms of
1992 have proved adequate, but pointed out that budgetary limits will be
reached in the next few years, that the Gatt agreement will require
change in 1999, and that the accession of Central and Eastern European
countries will add further pressure.
The report said there is considerable evidence that much of the
benefit of farm support went to sectors outside agriculture and that in
any case the industry has a declining -- though still important -- role
in the rural economy.
It calls for a clear distinction between social, environmental and
agricultural aims and the policy instruments to achieve these. It
largely dismisses the MacSharry reforms, estimates that set-aside would
reach 30% by the year 2005 on the present basis and that restrictions of
quotas on production cause serious distortions of the market.
It also rejects a two-tier price policy as unworkable and incompatible
with the Gatt rules.
Instead, the report calls for a move to the economics of the
marketplace through reductions in end-price and other production-related
support followed by the removal of production quotas. It admits this
would lead to a polarisation of farm sizes into fewer and larger units
through amalgamation and to smaller part-time units with an overall loss
in employment.
''At the same time, lower output prices and the removal of supply
controls would give a boost to the food processing industry, creating
potential for greater employment in this sector,'' the report said.
The authors accept this would do little for the less favoured areas --
principally the North of England, Scotland and Wales -- and advocates
the creation of a series of socio-structural measures to promote
development of particular regions.
The measures were expected to be largely or even wholly nationally
financed although subject to overall EU control.
Payments to farmers would also be related to the environmental
''goods'' whch they would deliver from a ''menu'' of options, such as
reduced chemical and fertiliser use, the preservation of species and
habitats, and the maintenance of desired landscapes and features.
The report immediately set alarm bells ringing among the farmers'
unions, who question the cavalier attitude of failing to support a
policy of food security, of whether environmental and other payments
would sufficiently offset direct production payments and, above all, the
validity of renationalisation of even part of the CAP.
John Ross, president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland,
defended the principles of compensation for cuts in market prices which,
he said, had brought stability, improved farm incomes and created a
confidence which helped to boost farm investment.
Scotland's farmers were not afraid of change or fair competition, he
said -- ''but it's difficult to see what contribution yet another call
for free market economics makes to the debate about Europe's future
agriculture policy.
''We take little comfort from the group's vague suggestion that new
sources of employment -- to be funded by the UK Government -- could be
found for disadvantaged areas. Jobs would be needed for most of
Scotland's hill farmers who would be the first to take the economic
impact of the withdrawal of support.
The Scottish Office emphasised yesterday that the think-tank had been
a personal initiative by Mr Waldegrave. It said policy would continue to
be the collective responsibility of the four UK ministers responsible
for agriculture.

CHEMICAL producer DuPont said yesterday that its second-quarter
earnings grew 18% to $938m because of productivity improvements and
strong revenue gains.
The company's earnings compared with $792m in the same period a year
ago. DuPont's per-share earnings rose more sharply, to $1.70 from $1.16,
due largely to the redemption of DuPont common stock from Seagram Co.
DuPont's second-quarter earnings included a one-time charge of $29m,
or 5 cents a share, reflecting costs related to the recall of Benlate
DF-50 fungicide. DuPont's quarterly sales rose to $11.08bn from
$10.16bn.

THE decision to stop Scottish athletics team internationals, which has
been forced on the sport's rulers by economic necessity, marks the end
of an era. It will upset both traditionalists, who were nurtured on such
contests, and some current competitors who, undoubtedly, will be denied
the chance to win international vests when the policy is fully
implemented. The escalating cost of sending full teams means only
top-flight competitors will be funded in future by the Scottish
Athletics Federation. SAF officials said some competitors at a match
last weekend were unworthy of representing their country, but because a
full team had to be sent, they had to be included. In some cases those
ultimately in the team were no better than fifth choice. Many of those
who rejected selection did so because they could not afford to accept
it.
The Duke of Edinburgh yesterday told the Central Council of Physical
Recreation's annual meeting that Government initiatives to improve sport
in schools was ''the best thing that's happened to sport for many a long
year''. The Prime Minister, Mr John Major, envisages a British Academy
of Sport backed by lottery funds. But world-ranked athletes attending
the Australian Government-funded equivalent receive five-figure
salaries, while district-level champions get #1500 twice a year. There
is no UK Government support for elite competitors at any level. Some
athletes who declined Scotland selection for a match in Wales last
weekend did so because they could not afford time off work.
Athletics, a significant victim of the teaching dispute, has caught up
lost ground better in Scotland than elsewhere in Britain. This is
reflected in record numbers of Scots in the UK team for the European
Junior Championships this week, and in forthcoming teams for under-20
and under-23 internationals. What the Government has failed to do,
however, is provide adequate funds to the Scottish Sports Council to
ensure proper backing of elite competitors -- not millionaires such as
Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell, but those who might succeed them.
The advent of the National Lottery has brought no improvement for
Britain's future champions. Which is why all the UK sports councils are
campaigning for lottery rules to be amended to permit delivery of funds
for ''performance and excellence''. Until that changes, many other
sportsmen and women may be denied the chance of representing their
country.

STERLING was in demand yesterday allowing its trade weighted index to
rise by 0.1 to 83.4. Dealers are awaiting the outcome of today's monthly
monetary meeting for a lead on the near-term direction of the pound.
This week's CBI Industrial Trends Survey pointing to a slowdown in the
economy means that Bank of England Governor Eddie George may lessen the
pressure on Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to raise interest rates to stave
off inflation.
The pound was almost a cent better than the dollar at $1.5958 and was
slightly up on the German mark at DM2.2143. The Conservative Party's
expected drubbing in today's Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election
has been largely discounted by the market.
The dollar was sold as dealers cashed in on earlier gains in the
absence of any new US economic data. However, it is a quiet market with
very thin dealings and so limited size trades had a bigger than normal
impact on the currency.

WASHINGTON: Daily injections of a special hormone turned fat mice into
lean and healthy rodents, suggesting to researchers that obese humans
may one day control their weight with simple shots or pills. Dr Jeffrey
Friedman says that the hormone he calls leptin forces the body to burn
excess fat, while having no apparent effect on lean tissue. However it
is still not known if it has any long-term side-effects.

I AM a Catholic priest serving two villages, Salsburgh and Harthill.
Their respective district councils, Monklands and Motherwell, have shown
very little interest in the provision of services like libraries,
swimming-pools, sports centres, new houses, etc.
Comparison with villages in the Lothians seems to suggest that the
Harthill area would have been better served by its transfer to West
Lothian District Council.
There is also some anarchy in Monklands and Motherwell with planning
permission for housing rejected in what is classified as a green belt.
However, both district councils had no hesitation in approving in the
green belt a racing track for cars and an extension of 17 acres to Tam's
Loup quarry.
The consultation process in both cases was almost non-existent.
With some trepidation, I look forward to the Unitary Council of North
Lanarkshire, since I suspect that villages like Salsburgh and Harthill
will continue to pay for extensive shopping precincts, massive prestige
projects, etc, in Motherwell, Cumbernauld, Airdrie, Coatbridge, and
other privileged areas.
Meanwhile the villages will suffer a slow painful death: Harthill with
over 300 primary schoolchildren and Salsburgh with over 150 have no
prospect of new housing. The employment situation has improved because
of our proximity to the Lothians.
Both Salsburgh and Harthill are relatively crime-free and are healthy
village communities with first-class access to Glasgow, Edinburgh, etc,
without traffic jams.
So far, the level of pollution is very low with excellent country
walks. The race track and the extension to the quarry will in large
measure vandalise the green belt and our healthy environment.

AS one of the filthy Cove and Kilcregganites mentioned in your columns
it occurred to me, mowing my lawn at the time, surely I was saving our
local authority quite a lot of disposing of my garden waste in my own
inimitable way by scattering it about my premises or by burning it below
high-water mark as the whim occurred.
I must generate several tones of garden rubbish every year, and as far
a I know the local authority does not make provision for the removal of
such rubbish. Nor should it, when the locals are perfectly able so to do
themselves.
Political rectitude is all very well but applying it to garden rubbish
is, to my mind, a misapplication of social imperatives.
One must bear in mind that not only do we not have a garden rubbish
collection, we do not have a sewage system. We do pay our sewage rates.

<TEXT>
LAWRIE &amp; Symington, the third-largest auction company in Scotland,
after a year during which the board of directors have had to devote much
of their energies in staving off a hostile takeover bid, have just
reported a much enhanced financial situation.
A pre-tax profit of #292,000 for the year to December 31, 1994, is
recorded against a very modest #23,000 in the previous year. Turnover
from all activities is marginally down at #2.41m against #2.58m, but in
contrast operating costs have been slashed from #2.76m to #2.34m -- a
reduction of over 15%.
The bank overdraft, never a major item in the company's affairs, stood
at nil at the year-end against a previous #2.54m. Earnings per share
have meanwhile risen from 0.55p to 2.24p, and this in turn has seen the
directors recommend a dividend of 3p per share.
However, while the trading position has significantly improved the
directors have made a not unexpected provision for an extraordinary item
of #100,000 to be charged against the profit. This reflects the
substantial costs incurred during the last year in warding off the
takeover bid from the Edinburgh investment company Caledonian Trust.
The bid saw the shares in L&amp;S soar from 19p to around #1 at the end of
last year. The current value of the shares is, however, uncertain, but
likely to be less than the #1 bid by Caledonian.
The balance sheet has been boosted by a revaluation of the company's
assets, which include marts at Lanark, Edinburgh and Peebles as well as
a substantial acreage of farm land. The new valuation lists total assets
at #5.58m against #1.02m -- a figure which company chairman John
Chapman, who is a leading butcher and chairman of Motherwell FC, says is
''still very conservative''.
Mr Chapman, in his report to the shareholders, also claims that as
well as the bid from Caledonian there were other predators lurking in
the background. ''These included two other auction markets and I am
certain of a third somewhere.''
The chairman will outline the board's future strategy at the annual
meeting on August 11. This will almost certainly include the upgrading
of Lanark Mart.

I WOULD like to clarify some of the points arising from William
Walker's letter regarding the Royal Scottish National Orchestra's
subscription ticket prices for senior citizens (July 22).
The RSNO's 1994-95 season was the first time that senior citizens were
offered a subscription discount. As Mr Walker points out this was an
extremely generous discount on the subscription package.
As a considerable number of our audience are senior citizens, the RSNO
found that it could not afford to offer such large discounts. We are
very sorry that this is the case, but in common with all arts
organisations the RSNO is having to survive in an increasingly
precarious financial climate.
As our senior citizen patrons are very important to the RSNO, we have
tried to offer a more flexible system to those subscribers. Last season
patrons booking a senior-citizen subscription were confined to two of
the higher-price areas of the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. These patrons
can now chose to purchase seats in any area of the hall and can
therefore select a price area which best suits their purse.
The RSNO senior citizens' subscription package does offer a discount
of up to 30% on full-price tickets: for example, for a patron taking the
entire season of 26 concerts, sitting in price area 5, each individual
concert would cost #4.79.
While we appreciate that these are not the top-price seats offered by
last year's package, it still allows music lovers to attend concerts by
Scotland's leading orchestra for under #5.
Concert-goers can also choose to book for individual concerts where
senior citizens can buy half-price tickets in certain areas.
Many of the RSNO's senior-citizen patrons have been attending concerts
for over 40 years and form a vital part of our loyal audience. We do
hope they can appreciate the necessity of these changes is to help
safeguard the future of the orchestra.

THE Scott Monument could not be described as a thing of beauty.
Despite its height it contrives to look squat, and viewing it through
narrowed eyes conveys irresistibly the outlines of a fantasy space
rocket. Nevertheless it is a part of Princes Street and therefore to be
treasured, not least because of some of the architectural outrages
committed against the street in past years. Furthermore, the monument is
such an essential representation and emblem of Edinburgh that the
capital would not be the same without it. The problem, most obviously,
is that the Scott Monument appears prepared to leave us before we are
willing to dispense with its services to both citizens and tourists. It
continues obstinately to crumble and it is clear that large sums of
money, possibly as much as #2m, must be spent to make it safe.
Predictably, Edinburgh District Council is unable to meet the cost of
restoration. This is understandable in a situation where Government
support to local authorities will continue to fall at the same time as
the burden of demand for the provision of basic essentials will continue
to rise.
If, as everyone agrees, the Scott Monument is too important to be
allowed to crumble, who will undertake its restoration and care?
Historic Scotland has been mentioned as it has the necessary expertise
to manage the monument after restoration. For once the perfect solution
lies with the Lottery Heritage Fund. Scotland has not been treated
generously by this organisation thus far, with few Scottish applications
for cash winning through to the next round of consideration.
The Scott Monument should meet the criteria perfectly, representing as
it does an object of national significance which will only need an
initial injection of cash and which can thereafter be run on a separate
budget. Nor will a grant of this sort raise public anger in the same way
as money for opera in London, or even the purchase of an esoteric art
collection. An approach for lottery heritage money has been made; what
is needed now is a swift decision.

SCOTTISHPOWER said yesterday it saw no grounds for the Government to
refer its #1000m bid for Manweb to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Chief executive Ian Robinson brushed aside concerns expressed by the
industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, that the takeover
would reduce competition in the industry.
''Clearly there is no competition issue,'' he said after the company's
packed annual meeting at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
Mr Robinson said ScottishPower and Manweb together controlled only 4%
of the competitive sector of the electricity supply market in England
and Wales. ''How can that be a problem?'' he asked.
Professor Littlechild said yesterday that ''additional measures would
be necessary in order to provide continued protection for customers and
to maintain regulatory effectiveness'' if the takeover went ahead.
He said in a consultation paper that ScottishPower's takeover of
Manweb would lead to more concentrated ownership of the electricity
industry.
This would have ''possible implications for competition in the supply
and generation of electricity,'' he added.
Professor Littlechild invited interested parties to comment on his
observations by August 18.
ScottishPower meanwhile continued buying Manweb shares on the open
market , boosting its stake in the Chester-based utility by a further
2.5% yesterday to 11.5%.
One merchant banker involved in the buying operation said there was no
shortage of sellers at just under the bid price of 915p per share.
ScottishPower could go on buying Manweb shares at this stage of the
bid process up to a limit of 29.9%, but one company official said it was
unlikely to go that far.
Manweb shares ended down 6p at 909, but ScottishPower rose 4p at 315p.
ScottishPower generates electricity, some of which is exported to
England, as well as distributing power to consumers.
But Mr Robinson said there was no prospect of selling electricity
direct to Manweb, which buys in nearly all the power that it distributes
in Merseyside and North Wales.
Present regulations only allow ScottishPower to sell power into the UK
pool, Mr Robinson noted.
ScottishPower chairman Murray Stuart told the meeting that the
existence of the bid from Manweb prevented him from making forecasts
about ScottishPower's own future performance.
But he said the company, which made a pre-tax profit of #375.3m on
turnover of #1715.8m in the year to March 31, was performing ''in line
with expectations'' during the current financial year.
Mr Stuart criticised Professor Littlechild indirectly for his constant
tinkering with the regulatory regime.
''The industry provides an essential service to society and it must
think and plan far ahead. For a company focused on the long term, a
stable regulatory environment is a critical influence on investment
decisions,'' he said.
''It is not in the customer's interest or in the shareholder's
interest if companies are forced, through uncertainty, to plan their
business investments on short-term perspectives,'' he added, without
naming the regulator directly.
More than 600 shareholders packed the stalls and lower circle of the
Royal Concert Hall to hear Mr Robinson explain the rationale for
ScottishPower's bid for Manweb.
He said the company went ahead with the bid after deciding that it
would offer better prospects for earnings growth than other
alternatives, including a buy-back of ScottishPower's own shares.
Mr Robinson repeated the argument that ScottishPower, a low-cost
distributor of power, could do much to improve efficiency in Manweb,
which has high operating costs and domestic tariffs.
But he shied away from saying how much ScottishPower planned to save
at Manweb through cost-cutting and reorganisation.
The annual meeting then turned into a comedy show for nearly two hours
as small shareholders stood up to attack the board for a multitude of
alleged sins and omissions.
One speaker criticised the board for not doing enough to lift
ScottishPower's share price. He urged the directors to show their faith
in the company by buying more shares.
Others grumbled about the 20% average rise in boardroom pay.
But Mr Stuart said ScottishPower was in the vanguard of corporate best
practice and already conformed to many of the recommendations of the
Greenbury committee.
One of the more entertaining speakers accused the board of being
packed with Englishman and neglecting Scotland's interests. This point
was rebutted by the chairman, who showed that Scots were in the
majority.
Another speaker urged the board to buy up Scotland's railways and
electrify every line. He even suggested that it could reopen a few that
had been closed.
This patriotic proposal drew loud cheers, but Mr Robinson said this
sort of investment would not show a good return.
One lady speaker criticised the board for being all-male and another
said most of the directors including Mr Robinson, the 53-year-old chief
executive, were too old.
But Mr Stuart, the 62-year-old chairman, reassured him that all the
directors have to retire at 65.

HOWEVER distasteful its main business may be to non-smokers, there is
no doubting BAT Industries' expertise in its chosen field and it has
excelled in the second quarter of 1995.
Profits jumped by a quarter to #653m and for the first half of the
year they were 22% ahead at #1151m. The trend is set to continue, with
chairman Sir Patrick Sheehy forecasting a ''substantial'' increase in
full-year profits over the comparable #1802m. Meanwhile, he has raised
the interim dividend by 9% to 9.25%.
In the half year, cigarette volumes surged by 22%. Part of this -- and
the profits increase -- reflected the purchase of American Tobacco but
like-for-like volume was still 12% ahead, a remarkable performance for a
company with such a large market share already. This is put at 13%
worldwide.
BAT shares rose 16p to 521p, adding #500m to its capitalisation. This
was in spite of a sharp fall overnight in the shares of BAT's American
arch-rival Philip Morris, caused by a newspaper report that US officials
were investigating the company, though it was downplayed by Morris.
The industry is well used to court cases and various official
inquiries and remains as ever confident of fighting them off. It could
hardly say anything else and the regulators are bound to have a further
impact on the industry over time, unless US House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's philosophy of rolling back government-inspired regulation in
general prevails.
The latest attack comes from the Food and Drug Administration. If it
can prove that cigarettes are addictive it can then take action by
stopping virtually all advertising of them. Sir Patrick noted that if
the FDA was successful it would be another restriction on the group but
not as draconian as some they have to cope with in certain other
countries.
At the moment, Brown &amp; Williamson, BAT's US offshoot, is riding high,
with the integration of last year's acquisition, American Tobacco, going
well. Half the projected $200m a year savings should come through this
year.
With volume rising 55%, it has 18% of the US market, with brands like
Kool, Carlton, Misty, and Capri all gaining share.
Exports are also booming, particularly to Japan. Elsewhere, Eastern
Europe and Brazil were strong markets. The German company benefited from
its inroads into the Polish market and there was a strong showing in
Ukraine. Souza Cruz in Brazil was helped by the Government's economic
stabilisation programme, which improved consumer confidence. The company
has 80% of the market.
BAT's financial services side also performed well given difficulties
in certain areas like UK life and pensions, raising trading profits by
20% to #520m.
In the life business, gross premium income was well down at #418m as a
result of low consumer confidence and problems associated with
commissions disclosure and other regulatory requirements which have
greatly slowed the sales process. Allied Dunbar saw a 50% fall in single
premium business, with net annual premiums down 5% in life products and
7% in pensions. It acquired the Save &amp; Prosper sales force and this
helped it expand market share, which improved from 4% to 4.5% in life
products and from 5% to 6% in pensions.
This will stand it in good stead when the market picks up again.
Overall Allied Dunbar managed to maintain its contribution to profits.
Eagle Star was well ahead at #108m despite a more competitive trading
climate, helped by better investment markets. Farmers, the US insurance
operation, also did better from the absence of major catastrophes and on
the back of an improving economy. The business is about to move back
into the Californian homeowners account, which it quit after an
earthquake rocked part of the state.
BAT is well placed to benefit from the expected expansion of the
financial services market as the welfare state is cut back.
In the tobacco sector, it sees growth for several years to come in the
new markets of Eastern Europe and the Far East, while there is no sign
of a further significant contraction in the old markets despite
increasing regulatory pressure. So BAT shares deserve a higher rating
than the 10-times prospective earnings they command, particularly given
their 5.7% yield.

LABOUR'S Scottish Health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, says that by not
banning tobacco advertising the Government is ''seen to be supportive of
the tobacco industry'' (July 20).
This is complete rubbish and frankly reveals how little Mr McAllion
understands about the way advertising works.
Other anti-smoking activists from ASH and the BMA quoted in the same
report make statements and judgments which are not borne out by the
known facts but simply represent rhetoric and single-issue
pressure-group campaigning.
No authoritative research has unequivocally shown that tobacco
advertising persuades young people to start smoking.
Over and over again, all round the world, independent bodies and
experts maintain that initiation influences are peer pressure and
parental example, and that advertising has nothing to do with why or
when a youngster decides to try smoking. Ask young people anywhere and
they will tell you this is so.
One wonders if perhaps the constant hassling and anti-tobacco
propaganda has generated resentment among teenagers who traditionally
hate being told what they must and must not do.

If a mother had a very difficult delivery that can actually affect the
child's sleeping pattern
He has learned his place is in his cot
Elizabeth Westcott explains that mothers can teach restive babies to
sleep at regular times
PATRICIA WATSON was at her wit's end. She was having great difficulty
in getting her 18-month-old son Patrick to settle in his cot each
evening, and every single night he would wander into her room demanding
to sleep in his parents' bed. She was becoming increasingly tired and
irritable as the days wore on, and she was worried about her son's
irregular sleeping habits.
''It was awful. I was absolutely exhausted, and trying to cope after
hardly any sleep. Every night it just went on and on, and it was so
disruptive I knew I would have to do something,'' she says.
She rang health visitor Joanna Girling at the Stockbridge Health
Centre in Edinburgh, and discovered that a sleep clinic had recently
started up, designed to combat exactly these problems. She and her
husband met with Girling for a full assessment of their situation, and
immediately began to implement the suggestions on how to regulate their
son's sleep timetable.
''What a difference! It was incredible,'' says Watson. ''We did
everything suggested and he responded very quickly.
''My aim was to get him to sleep from seven at night till seven in the
morning, and we started with his bedtime routine. He was very reluctant
to let me out of the room while he went to sleep, but I would gradually
edge my way out.
''During the night each time he got out of his cot I took him back.
The first few nights I was up seven or eight times with him. Although at
first I felt I couldn't stand having to get out of bed, in the end it
was definitely worth it, because he has learned his place is in his
cot.''
The toddler is now much happier altogether. He sleeps well during the
night and even takes an afternoon nap. Watson is refreshed and back to
normal; although her days are busy, she has her evenings, from seven
onwards, to relax or even go out, something that previously wasn't
possible.
''Even just having two full hours of uninterrupted sleep makes a
difference. It's the quality of sleep which is important,'' she says.
Quality, not quantity, seems to be the key when it comes to sleep.
According to Dr Jim Horne, director of the Sleep Research Laboratory at
Loughborough University, the first few hours of sleep are essential.
Deep sleep differs from the latter hours of flexible, non-restorative
sleep in that the electrical activity of the brain (''brain waves'') is
of a particular variety called ''slow-wave sleep''.
The brain, especially the cerebral hemispheres, can only rest when it
goes ''off line'' into this deep sleep. Constant interruptions to deep
sleep result in exhaustion. As Watson pointed out and many parents would
agree, even a relatively short period of uninterrupted sleep can have a
more restorative effect than light dozing, even if the light sleep is
stretched over a longer time.
Light sleep makes up just more than half of sleep, REM sleep (Rapid
Eye Movement sleep, symptomatic of dreaming) a quarter, and deep sleep
another quarter. According to Girling, it is during the changeover from
deep sleep to lighter sleep when most youngsters wake up and start
crying; they need a breast or a comforter before going back to sleep
again. Her technique focuses on teaching young children and babies how
to go to sleep by themselves.
''The sleep clinic is a self-referral system and I usually see both
partners about six times,'' says Girling.
''On the first visit I do a full assessment which takes them back to
before the pregnancy, I look at the birth history and the delivery. If a
mother had a very difficult delivery that can actually affect the
child's sleeping pattern.
''One woman had a horrendous delivery which felt very intrusive upon
her body, and she found it difficult to put her baby to sleep when it
cried. I find talking about this is beneficial, there's often no-one for
women to talk to about the birth in a confidential way.''
Girling then gives the parents a 24-hour sleep diary to fill out,
which maps the child's sleeping pattern during that period, including
day-time naps and night-time interruptions. After looking at the diary
she gives the parents a plan designed to alter the child's sleeping
patterns during the next six weeks, giving them a small task to achieve
by the end of each week.
''The approach varies according to the child's age, but I usually sort
out the daytime naps in the first week,'' she said.
''They shouldn't nap before 10.30am or after 3.30pm. The child should
be put down without having to rely on a trigger, like a bottle, so that
if they wake up they can go back to sleep without needing that trigger
again. The mother can sit by the bed, but by the next week she should be
able to leave.
''By the third week we look at the evening. There should be a routine,
a bath and a quiet time -- no rampaging -- before bed. After a feed the
mother can sit by the cot then gradually move away, just as before. Once
you've cracked the evenings you should be able to deal with night-time
interruptions. Eventually the child will learn to go to sleep by
itself.''
The whole process takes about five or six weeks, by which time the
family should have settled into a routine which is comfortable for
everyone. The impact this can have on the quality of life for the
parents and their child can be dramatic, as Watson experienced.
''Because they don't have access to information about sleep -- there
isn't much about -- parents tend to just put up with all this from their
children. I think there should be more awareness about sleeping
patterns.''

THE wind was taken out of the sails of the water sector when the
Monopolies and Mergers Commision decision to block the proposed hostile
takeover of Northumbrian Water by the French utility Lyonnaise des Eaux
became known, writes NICOLA REEVES.
The bid will be allowed to proceed only if it includes substantial
price cuts for all customers of the combined businesses of Northumbrian
and North East Water, which Lyonnaise already owns. Shares in
Northumbrian Water shrank 63p to 895p.
Other water stocks lost ground. Southern Water, also tipped as a
possible bid target, lost 15p to 525p. Severn Trent dropped 13p to 606p
while Anglian Water was 15p cheaper at 563p. The falls in the share
price are probably overdone because the water companies still offer an
attractive yield relative to the rest of the market.
The companies command a prospective dividend yield premium of between
45% to 50%. There were concerns in the City that the MMC's decision
might increase the pressure for a monopoly probe into ScottishPower's
bid for Manweb. This led to falls in the share prices of some of the
regional electricity companies.
The Northumbrian takeover was said to be against the public interest
because of its affect on Ofwat, the industry regulator's ability to
monitor competition. Ofwat welcomed the MMC's decision. Ian Byatt, who
heads Ofwat, said that he had told the MMC that price cuts of 15%-20% by
the merged business would be needed to make up for the lack of control
by Ofwat.
Following the MMC's decision, Northumbrian Water urged the French
group to clarify its intentions ''in order to end any prolonging of the
uncertainty for Northumbrian's shareholders, customers and employees''.
The City believes that water companies may shy away from trying to buy
their rivals. Although an MMC probe had been expected, the size of the
price cuts suggested was much larger than predicted. Donna Lury at
Brokers Nikko Securities said that price cuts on the scale mentioned
could slice as much as #30m off the joint revenues of Northumbrian and
North East.
Lyonnaise launched its hostile bid for Northumbrian on March 6 and it
was automatically referred to the MMC under the Water Industry Act. As a
result, the French group has yet to put a price tag on its bid.
Lyonnaise said that it will discuss its proposed bid with Ofwat before
deciding whether to proceed with a formal offer.
Ian Lang, President of the Board of Trade, has asked Ian Byatt of
Ofwat to report back to him on his talks with Lyonnaise by 29 September.
City analysts believe that if the bid is to go ahead then Lyonnaise will
not want to offer more than #8.50 a share.

MERGERS of companies in the financial arena mean fewer customers for
Reuters and the newsgathering and electronic dealing services and
information group is projecting a slow-down in revenue growth in the
second half of 1995, after seeing a 19% advance to #1295m in the first
half.
The news lopped 19[1/2]p from the shares at 536[1/2]p, despite an 18%
rise in first half profits. The interim dividend is increased by 21% to
2.3p.
Chief executive Peter Job said the forecast slowdown would not be
''cataclysmic'' and growth would still be in double digits. However, it
could be in single figures next year.
Reuters' customer list is being reduced by the spate of mergers and
acquisitions in financial services like securities trading and merchant
banking. Revenue growth in the first half benefited by #67m from
acquisitions. Partly as a result of these, costs grew by 18%, though
margins edged ahead from 20% to 20.4%.
Apart from the 72% increase in revenue from emerging markets, the best
performer was the US with a 22% revenue gain, though it had slowed to
just 5% in the second quarter. Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew
by 19% and Asia Pacific by 11%
Transaction products, which enable traders to deal via a keyboard and
screen, showed the best growth, with revenue up 26% to #317m.
Information products rose 17% to #904m.
To offset the slow-down in its traditional financially-oriented
business, Reuters is aiming to raise market share and develop businesses
supplying information to other sectors of the economy.

MARY BEITH describes her findings after setting out to rescue medieval
Highland and Islands' medicine for posterity
IT WAS over a probably not healthy plate of fish and chips in Glasgow
in January 1980 that the matter was decided. Ronnie Black (now senior
lecturer in Celtic studies at Edinburgh University) was cataloguing the
Gaelic manuscripts in the National Library and had brought along
photocopies of pages from medical works composed in the Highlands in the
Middle Ages.
Would I look into Gaelic traditional and official medieval medicine
and write a book so that people would know about a neglected area of
their heritage?
Arrogantly, I supposed it would take a couple of years. But the more
the subject unfolded and the more ramifications it disclosed, the more I
understood what Ronnie meant by ''neglect'' -- and the more I was aware
of my own ignorance. The neglect verged on abuse. Here was a Highland
past far removed from battles, oppression and spurious glamour, with
people showing a confidence in skills and knowledge, and hereditary
physicians combining formal European training with native learning.
In 1904 the Caledonian Medical Society pleaded for work on the
manuscripts as a ''service which we ought to render to our country, and
by its accomplishment we should rear a memorial to the men from whom we
are proud to trace our professional descent''.
But apart from a stilted and unreliable English version (1910) of a
medieval Gaelic Rule of Health, and an unpublished 1991 MA dissertation
containing translations of sizeable sections of an early
seventeenth-century manuscript compiled in Mull, not a lot has been
done.
In 1986 John Bannerman published an invaluable and scholarly study of
the genealogies, education, and landholdings of one family of
physicians, giving exhaustive lists of manuscripts and their provenance
-- but rarely on their medical contents. Papers appeared occasionally in
academic journals, notably Derick Thomson's seminal Gaelic Learned
Orders and Literati in Medieval Scotland (1968), but little if anything
filtered through to the general public.
The people's remedies have fared little better, despite a scattered
dissemination. Usually they rate a folksy mention: black cocks
sacrificed as a remedy for, say, epilepsy, with little or no attempt to
set them in context.
Why had there been no attempt to gather the whole wide-ranging lore of
the Highlands and set it in the perspective of its time and society?
For centuries Gaelic medicine had interchanged ideas with other
traditions, but this was cultural swamping.
There are several standard approaches to writing about traditional
medicines -- austere, nit-picking and unreadable anthropological
commentaries; the ooh-ah-weren't-they-quaint school of non-thought; and
the New Agey ''ancient wisdom from a Golden Age'' persuasion.
But common sense was the keynote of Gaelic medicine. Certainly, there
were mystical elements, but they were advised by an understanding of the
human mind.
The intellect behind traditional medicine simply lacked a refined
technology. Alexander McCutcheon (1875-1927), a chemist fascinated by
the remedies of Badenoch, told his colleagues: ''(The) pharmacy of today
is an advanced science, but we are working upon a heritage which has
been calcined and refined in the crucible of experience.''
And there is more to the old medicines than a catalogue of curses and
manuscripts. The latter reveal that medieval Gaels had a basic belief in
preventive medicine, and the importance of maintaining health through
diet, exercise, and hygiene.
As Ronnie Black confirms: ''Jottings in the margins and blank spaces
of manuscripts tend to reveal the physician meeting the day-to-day
realities of reassuring patients (aphorisms) and providing them with
weapons they sought for their battles against disease, ageing,
sterility, injury and death (charms).
''In medical terms none of this is unique among European traditions;
what is distinctive is the apparent convergence of interests between
doctor and patient . . . The language of the texts is not secret jargon,
but a simple Early Modern Gaelic comprehensible everywhere from Melness
to Munster. One has the impression that they were doctors who listened
to their patients as well as talking to them.''
Not all the remedies have disappeared. The use of the slime of black
snails or slugs to get rid of corns and warts still exists in places as
far apart as Barra and Kinlochbervie. (Warts may be banished by a
variety of means but eradicating corns is something else, so the slime
may be worthy of further investigation.) The excellent, if bitter,
bogbean tonic continues to be made in Lewis. Heather sprigs are still
put under pillows, not as a twee notion culled from craft or health
shops, but from a lingering belief in the plant's ability to give
refreshing sleep.
In 1990 the Sir John MacDonald Study Fund gave a generous grant which
enabled me to sit down and get my researches together.
I only hope I have done some small justice to the subject. I have no
medical or herbal qualifications and Healing Threads is not written as a
guide for self-medication. Indeed, I would have had precious little
knowledge to put into the book at all had it not been for the great help
of many people throughout the Highlands and islands and beyond.
What I have tried to do is simply tell a story that was much in need
of telling.

They will periodically be displayed in the Dean Centre once the #2.5m

ECLIPSE Blinds yesterday announced a #4.2m placing and open offer
which will return the revitalised company to the dividend list two years
earlier than would otherwise have been possible.
Early last year, company doctor and chairman Hamish Grossart outlined
his three-year rescue plan for Eclipse, which suffered a near-death
experience during its former days as the Ashley Group, to the City.
With fortune having smiled on the refocused window blinds company, Mr
Grossart anticipates the recovery will be virtually complete by the end
of this year.
Having returned gearing from 2100% to a more normal level, Eclipse,
based at Inchinnan near Paisley, will then be able to look at capital
projects and suitable acquisitions.
All of the 26.4 million Ordinary shares are being placed at 17p with
institutions, with shareholders having the right to claw back all of
them.
Existing Ordinary shareholders can buy one new share for every six
held, with Convertible Preference shareholders allowed to subscribe for
new Ordinary shares on a five-for-24 basis.
With Mr Grossart averse to the perception of Eclipse as a ''penny
dreadful'', there will be a one-for-five consolidation of existing and
new Ordinary shares.
As a result of the placing and open offer, which requires shareholder
approval, Eclipse should be able to pay a final dividend of 1.0p per
consolidated share for the current year to end-December, the first for
three years. This is equivalent to a payout of 0.2p per existing share.
Without the placing and open offer, Eclipse believes it could not have
paid an Ordinary dividend before early 1998.
Equally, Preference dividend arrears of #1.7m could probably not have
been cleared before the second half of 1997 but, with the new capital,
the company plans to pay them on September 30.
There will also be amendments to the rights attached to Convertible
Preference shares, which will reduce the rate of dividend payable until
end-June 1999, enhance conversion rights, and give Eclipse the right,
but not obligation, to redeem them four years early in 1999. The current
cost of Preference capital is considered inappropriate.
Eclipse, which has recovered from a disastrous foray into Spanish food
retailing, has been focused by Mr Grossart on the more profitable and
successful activity of the merchandised distribution of textiles and
components for window-blind systems.
Mr Grossart said: ''Completing this modest capital-raising will be the
last important step in the financial recovery process.
''We remain of the view that 1995 will be a second successive year of
markedly improving fortunes for Eclipse.''
The company made pre-tax profits of #4.42m last year, after a #20.6m
loss in its previous 12 months.

* TRAIN drivers are thinking along healthy lines in opting for a cut
in hours. New research suggests much of Britain is heading in the
opposite direction, towards a Japanese-style 12-hour working day.
Enter, as a result, VES -- Vital Exhaustion Syndrome -- characterised
by insomnia, headaches, chronic fatigue, backache and demoralisation.
Translated, that means increased risk of heart attacks and premature
death.
British workers already suffer more stress-related illnesses than the
rest of the EU, costing 177 million lost working days each year.
When John Major hails Japanese inward investment he never mentions
Karoshi . . . death from overwork that's killing 10,000 Japanese each

maintain outside interests, take regular exercise, and set aside more
time to nurture family relationships.
* PRESS-THE-FLESH politicians at Littleborough and Saddleworth might
have benefited this week from taking a close look at their palms for an
indication of beta-carotene levels. That's the anti-oxidant found in
carrots that protects against heart and circulation.
A healthy intake of beta-carotene can half the risk, according to
research at the University of Ulster. No need to pay the fortune-teller
to check your life expectancy: simply press your palm firmly with the
fingers of the other hand, and release. There should be a yellowish hue.
If it's grey or white, start munching.
* THE answer to crime on Scotland's streets may not be more police,
but a ''liquid cosh'' of extra vitamins. Mounting evidence implies that
aggression and violence can be triggered by nutritional deficiencies
from an unbalanced diet.
To prove the point, 200 young offenders at a maximum security unit are
to be given vitamin and mineral supplements to see if it alters their
behaviour. Already, studies have indicated that adding a glass of
freshly squeezed orange juice at breakfast time reduces violence among
prison inmates. They may just prefer it to porridge, of course.
* AS Spina Bifida Week is launched next week the importance of folic
acid in the diet is being highlighted. Around 2000 babies are born in
Britain each year with the condition.
By the time a woman knows she is pregnant it may be too late to boost
folic acid intake that can combat spina bifida. Women of childbearing
age are urged to adopt a diet rich in folic acid, found in spinach,
broccoli, brussels sprouts and yeast extracts. The Co-op has responded
by providing 50% of recommended daily allowance in an average serving of
its bran cereal.

''I DON'T see any upturn for years. Now is normal,'' said chairman Sir
Simon Hornby, chairman of Lloyds Abbey Life. He was backed up by chief
executive Stephen Maran as seeing the financial services industry
embarked on a long hard road in the restoration of customer confidence.
The 63%-owned subsidiary of Lloyds Bank came out with half-time
results above expectations with pre-tax profits advancing 15% to #197m.
The most encouraging and perhaps startling ingredient was the success
of the guaranteed bonds which boosted single premiums by 86%, admittedly
from a depressed comparable period when the insurance industry was still
in turmoil over mis-selling of pensions. That is in stark contrast to
unit trust sales which tumbled by half to indicate that consumers are
looking to safety first above all.
Lloyds Abbey Life continued to find pension selling tough in the
personal sector although small businesses were small receptive. Mr Maran
added that it will need a well-trained salesforce to restore customer
confidence and so he is experimenting with a salaried team where
commission disclosure will not be an issue.
The 360 or so Black Horse estate agency offices saw losses escalate
from #2.8m to #6.3m. As a company, Lloyds Abbey Life is depressed about
the housing market and fears that it will take some years to recover.
Yet it is continuing in the business as any improvement will come
through very rapidly in profits due to its high cost gearing.
Lloyds Bowmaker Finance is now experiencing its lowest-ever level of
bad debts at just #600,000 on its #2700m book. Unfortunately new car
sales are falling back and it looks as if the peak of the lending cycle
has been reached with advances now falling.
Trans-Leben Insurance in Germany continued in loss ablbeit at a more
restricted level than last year and there is a possibility it could
swing into profit over the next few months. But over the past five years
it has brought little but grief and it may not be a core activity too
much longer.
It is difficult to be enthusiastic about group prospects until
confidence does return to the housing market and to life assurance --
Sir Simon again blamed the press for criticising the industry. But at
least it is arguably the best performer in the sector.
A doubling of half-time profits for the full year to about #390m
(#315m) would be a very good result, leaving the shares at 418p trading
at 11.3 times likely earnings which seems high enough.
The interim dividend has been raised 7% to 7.3p with a 21p total in
view for a 6.3% yield.

BRITISH Steel, which last month announced soaring annual earnings to
make it the world's most profitable steel producer, yesterday predicted
results in the current financial year will be even better.
At the company's annual meeting, chairman and chief executive Brian
Moffat said: ''I believe that British Steel is making real progress
towards its goal of being a world class, internationally based steel
company and, with further benefits from selling prices and our
continuing drive on competitiveness, I expect 1995/96 to show
considerable improvement on last year.''
He added: ''While in the USA and in Europe there has been some recent
easing in economic growth, market conditions remain good and our own
performance continues to improve at a very satisfactory rate.''
British Steel was a world leader in terms of profits, productivity and
competitiveness and intended to remain so, although there was no room
for complacency, Mr Moffat told the meeting.
Booming exports by Britain's manufacturers pushed up the demand for
steel by 9% during the year to the end of March, helping pre-tax profits
jump sevenfold to #578m, the group announced in June.
The company is investing heavily in the US and has increased its
investment in Avesta Sheffield, the stainless steel joint venture,
created by the group a number of years ago.
''But we are not neglecting our assets in the UK, which, for the
foreseeable future, will continued to be the group's main source of
profit.''
Major expansion in capacity is taking place at Llanwern, South Wales,
enabling the group to increase efficiency and respond to market demand.
''Underpinning these efforts is the relentless drive to improve our
cost base by adopting more flexible working methods and reliable
practices.
''Efficiency savings last year alone exceeded #70m and there is more
to come.''
Within the EU, state ownership of the steel industry has been cut from
about 50% to less than 20%, providing the prospect of a more competitive
and open market in steel.
British Steel has also enjoyed a huge increase in demand from the
world's emerging markets, particularly Asia and the Far East.
''Currently we supply many of these markets from the UK but if
attractive opportunities are identified to build assets in these new
growth regions, needless to say we will pursue them.''

<HEADLINE>Bank of England may face lawsuit by Barings group that holds #55m in notes</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ANDREW WILSON</BYLINE>

<RECORDNO>977191099</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England may be sued by the Barings' 9[1/4]% Perpetual
Noteholders Action Group, which represents owners holding #55m of the
#100m of notes issued early last year by the merchant bank, which
crashed earlier this year.
Group chairman Jonathan Stone has several times written to Bank of
England Governor Eddie George who initially asked him to wait for the
outcome of the official inquiry which was published on July 7. The
inquiry, in effect, largely exonerated the Bank of England of any
significant failures in supervision of Barings.
In a letter sent after the inquiry, Mr Stone was told that Mr George
had nothing further to add.
Mr Stone is likely to argue that the Bank did fail in its regulatory
duty and that it is therefore liable to make good the value of the
notes.
Mr Stone headed the Burmah Shareholders Action Group which in 1976
sued the Bank for the return of the blighted oil company's holdings in
BP and Shell, which were seized at the time of the lifeboat operation.
On that occasion, he was unsuccessful.
Also taking a close interest in the proceedings is the Association of
British Insurers whose members had #25m invested. These include Scottish
Amicable.
However, there is a large number of private individuals including many
pensioners who hold the notes. They invested in the stock on the
recommendation of their financial advisers as a means to obtain a high
yielding and secure investment.
The prospectus was issued under the names of BZW, Cazenove, and Hoare
Govett -- three of the City's most highly regarded brokers.
In addition, one loan note holder said yesterday that as Barings was
part of the inner circle of the Accepting Houses Committee, there was
the assumption that the Bank of England was there as the bank of last
resort.
BZW, for one, is refusing to make any comment.
The next formal step is for the Barings administrator, Alan Bloom of
Ernst &amp; Young, to study the detailed analysis of the official report
into the collapse and decide what to do next. He is under an obligation
to try to secure repayment from any available source which includes
possibly not only the Bank but Barings' auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
They failed to pick up in 1993 that the now notorious errors account
88888 set up by derivatives trader Nick Leeson in Singapore had already
accumulated losses of #23m -- the final tally on February 27 this year
was #827m when Barings collapsed. Most of Barings was subsequently
bought by the Dutch ING group, which assumed no obligation for the
notes.
If Mr Stone does sue the Bank successfully, it will be the first time
such an action against a regulator has been won.

Paris, Wednesday
THE death toll from a bomb on the Paris Metro rose to seven today as a
security alert triggered a wave of false alarms and the government
pointed to possible Muslim fundamentalist or Serb connections.
Three passengers who were badly burned in yesterday's blast in a
rush-hour underground train at the Saint-Michel station died of their
wounds in hospital. Eleven others were listed in critical condition.
The time-bomb, estimated to contain 6[1/2] to 11lb of explosives, blew
up on an RER regional express train in the heart of Paris, close to
Notre-Dame cathedral.
''The Islamic trail is possible, the Serbian trail is not
impossible,'' said Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre. However he did
not rule out other potential perpetrators.
In an exceptional move for a country where informing is regarded as
betrayal, the French Government offered a F1m (#133,000) reward for
information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators.
''I have decided that one million francs will be offered to any person
who provides information making it possible to identify and arrest the
guilty person or persons,'' Debre said on France-2 television news.
Police said they and the media had received about 50 calls claiming
responsibility for the blast, but none appeared to be serious.
It was the bloodiest attack in the French capital since a wave of
Middle East-related bombings in the mid-1980s and prompted alerts in
Paris and the provinces today. Police stepped up patrols and tightened
border checks, and security was bolstered at both ends of the Channel
Tunnel.
False alarms closed several Paris Metro stations today. Bomb scares
forced the evacuation of 8000 visitors from the Louvre Museum and
hundreds of customers from the Virgin Megastore in the Champs-Elysees
avenue.
Elsewhere, police cleared railway stations in Marseille and Bordeaux
as a bomb psychosis spread nationwide.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe said after a Cabinet meeting that police
had been ordered to carry out systematic identity checks to avert more
attacks.
About 1000 extra riot police and gendarmes were drafted into Paris
overnight. A further 1800 will be deployed in the capital and other big
cities.
All luggage lockers at stations would be searched today, Debre said.
''Citizens should be vigilant about any package they see, about anyone
behaving strangely,'' Debre said. ''The French people must help me.''
Since President Jacques Chirac took office in May, he has drawn
attention with calls for tougher action against Bosnian Serb
''barbarism'' and Algerian Islamic extremism. He has also triggered
international protests by deciding to resume nuclear tests in the
Pacific.
Government spokesman Francois Baroin said investigators were following
two main leads -- Muslim militants and Bosnian Serbs. Fundamentalist
activists in Algeria accuse France of backing military rulers in the
North African nation's civil war.
The Pope, Prime Minister John Major, and visiting Palestine Liberation
Organisation chairman Yasser Arafat all voiced horror at the attack.
The head of the Paris Mosque, Dalil Boubakeur, deplored the bombing as
a ''barbaric act'' and urged Muslims to dissociate themselves from
violence.
The blast occurred two weeks after gunmen shot dead a founder of
Algeria's outlawed Islamic Salvation Front, Sheikh Abdelbaki Sahraoui,
who settled at the Paris mosque after the army scrapped a 1992 election
which the Islamists were set to win.
The newspaper Le Figaro said one caller to its switchboard, speaking
in German on behalf of a mysterious group of ''friends of Carlos'',
demanded that France free the international guerrilla Illich Ramirez
Sanchez, alias Carlos the Jackal, captured by French agents in Sudan
last August and now awaiting trial in a Paris prison.
Chirac has called for a robust response to Bosnian Serbs who have
overrun UN ''safe areas'' in Bosnia. French soldiers are the largest
contingent in a UN peacekeeping force there.
The Saint-Michel station reopened today but trains were again halted
briefly this morning after a person was killed on the northbound track
in an apparent suicide.--Reuter.

IVORY &amp; Sime's Continental Assets Trust mirrored the advance in its
benchmark index during the six months to end-June, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The Edinburgh-based investment trust raised fully-diluted net asset
value by 8.6% to 216.5p, while the James Capel Smaller European (4th
Quartile) index rose 8.4% in sterling terms.
During the six months, the FT/S&amp;P Actuaries World index for Europe
(excluding the UK) gained 10.6%. This index of larger stocks reflects
what investors are giving up to divert their money into smaller European
companies.
With the prospects of an increased rate of economic growth on the
Continent diminishing, Continental Assets believes interest rate cuts,
by central banks, including the German Bundesbank, could be in the
pipeline.
Other things being equal, and with inflation apparently under control,
this would probably benefit first larger, then smaller, Continental
European stocks. However, on the downside, estimates of corporate
profits are being reduced, in the light of the general economic
backdrop.
Germany and France feature most prominently in the portfolio, followed
by the Netherlands. Continental Assets, with shareholders' funds of #52m
and borrowings of #11m, is also invested in Switzerland, Sweden, Italy
and Spain.

MAJOR companies are increasingly looking to reduce their supplier base
and concentrate on building close partnerships with key suppliers. This
is good news for the precision engineer Rubicon, which serves the
computer industry and reported strong profits growth last year.
Profit before tax in the 12 months to 31 May jumped by 64% to just
under #4m. Turnover was 14% better at #56.8m. Fully diluted earnings per
share rose by 23% to 10.8p and the dividend per share increased by 15%
to 5.3p after a final shareholders payment of 3.3p.
Net margins are expected to remain stable at 9%-10% although gross
margins were hit last year by one-off costs associated with the
introduction of new computer ranges at both IBM and Compaq in a short
space of time.
Rubicon is the third-largest supplier in the world to IBM. Rubicon is
well placed from its two Scottish sites, within its largest operating
unit HSP Scotland, to meet the just-in-time manufacturing requirements
of major computer groups. Rubicon's existing facilities at Beith in Ayr
and Hamilton are complementary.
Action is being taken to improve the productivity record at the
Hamilton site to the level seen in Rubicon's Beith facility. Managing
director Tim Wightman said he was ''very optimistic'' about the
potential for the Hamilton site following the recent introduction of a
productivity scheme and a two-year wage deal. The combination of the two
Scottish sites enables Rubicon to be globally competitive with companies
in the USA and Far East.
Scotland's Silicon Glen accounts for #2100m of the UK's #3500m market
for electronic purchasing. The whole European market for such purchases
is #21bn. The bulk of Rubicon's 1300 staff are employed on its two
Scottish sites.
According to Mr Wightman, Silicon Glen ''is unbeatable'' when it comes
to having a focused customer base. Its clients include IBM, Digital, and
Compaq all sufficiently nearby to ensure several daily deliveries.
Although it has a strong customer base Rubicon is keen to develop a
second division in order to reduce its dependence on the computer
industry which is cyclical.
Some form of equity-financed acquisition is likely to occur within the
next 18 months, which would also have the benefit of improving the
marketability of Rubicon's shares which are held by a spread of large
financial institutions.

THE late John P Mackintosh, one of the founding fathers of the
devolution movement and surely the sharpest of Scotland's post-war
political breed, told me the tale of how, shortly after his election to
Parliament, he went for a drink with a Tory MP in the Carlton Club. He
was then introduced by his host to an old buffer sinking the port in the
corner.
''This is Mackintosh -- he is the new member for East Lothian.''
''Splendid,'' came the voice from the armchair, ''Bill Anstruther-Gray
must have been delighted to have been succeeded by a fine young fella
like you.''
John P did not have the heart to point out that he was a Labour member
who had just wrested the seat formerly held by Sir William
Anstruther-Gray from the Tories. There can be no surprise that
Mackintosh would have been happy to join a Tory member at his club; he
was the most gregarious of men who liked nothing better than to take on
the opposition on their own territory.
More importantly, he willingly admitted to having friends in every
part of the House. Who would be so ready to do that today? I was
discussing with a senior Labour politician earlier this week the
Government's suggestion that, in rented accommodation, Probationary
Tenancies might be offered to young people and to those with a history
of causing trouble to their neighbours. We agreed there were pros and
cons to the idea but we were able to come to a compromise position.
Yet we knew, both of us, that had we been debating this in the council
chamber, or even in the House, that would never have been possible. It
would have been motion and amendment -- he would have slated the
Government for ever thinking of such a thing, I would have been expected
to support it down the line.
British politics is like the Wild West, black hats and white hats,
good guys and bad guys, ya boo sucks, and we must all follow the lead or
be banished. Truth is rarely allowed to interfere with a good political
slanging match. Which might just be why so few people, particularly
those under the age of 30, are in the least bit concerned who runs the
councils or the country.
I love politics and I like politicians. They are often a damned sight
more intelligent than top businessmen or trade union leaders; the
Greenbury inquiry should be a lesson to us all as to what it would be
like to be governed by non-elected bosses.
Yet I feel the present political structure is failing the very people
it is meant to serve. My political heroes were or are all maverick
figures to a greater or lesser degree -- Churchill, Ian Macleod,
Mackintosh, Macmillan, Julian Critchley, George Walden -- men who were
prepared to upset the conventions by telling the truth, even if it cost
them promotion.
To that list I should also add Tam Dalyell, a man with whom I have
rarely agreed but whose integrity is without question, and Menzies
Campbell who consistently utters good sense, a language rarely spoken by
anyone else in his party.
Yet such politicians are becoming scarcer. Most, as George Walden put
it in announcing his retirement this week, prefer ''an auction of
promises which it is becoming more and more impossible to deliver''. Or,
to put it another way, to lie.
The Tories lied about taxation before the last election, the Labour
Party is lying now about full employment, the SNP has to pretend this
will be a land of milk and honey given independence. It won't.
There are often good reason for disguising the truth. We have become a
something for nothing society; we do not like to be told that a health
service which guarantees us cover from cradle to grave, and all the
transplants we require, would cost at least double what we are paying
now.
Many of us say, piously, that we would be happy to pay more for the
likes of education or old age pensions; just as religiously we vote
against parties which even threaten to raise taxes. Anyone with a single
brain cell must know that Mr Tony Blair's programme cannot be funded by
present levels of taxation.
Only Mr Blair, if he wants to be PM, and boy does he want to, is
required to evade the question.
Politicians lie because they are scared of being turfed out if they
don't. That says as much about the electorate as it does about them.
On the subject of truth many people have asked me if I was aware that
Michael Forsyth and his pillion passenger, David McLetchie, president of
the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association, were fervent
devolutionists some 20 years ago and wrote a strategy paper which said
so. No, I did not know that, but I refuse to denigrate them for it.
After all, not everyone becomes wiser as they become older.
But what did amuse me were the bold boys' remarks about the annual
Scottish Tory conference, or as they put it: ''The great non-event of
the SCUA.''
They go on: ''Delegates . . . are predominantly old and female. Apart
from aspiring politicians, few between the ages of 25 or 55 participate
or attend.
''Such a conference composition hardly bodes well for lively,
intelligent or constructive debate and the conference managers are
highly adept at assuring that controversy is stifled, both by the
selection of motions and the standing orders which make chairman's
rulings virtually unchallengeable.
''The conference as a forum for ordinary party members is a sham -- it
is in essence a set piece platform for the party leaders to conduct a
public relations exercise.''
Now tell us, lads, as SOS and heid bummer at the conference, what has
changed?

United Nations, Wednesday
THE Security Council loses its ''schoolmaster'' tomorrow with the
retirement of British Ambassador Sir David Hannay, considered one of the
most gifted diplomats at the United Nations in decades.
The longest-serving ambassador on the 15-member council, Sir David is
forced to retire from the foreign service because he has reached 60.
''No appeal from that,'' he said. His replacement is Sir John Weston,
Britain's ambassador to Nato.
For Americans Sir David is the caricature of the English gentleman --
pin-striped suit, erect posture, nose in the air, often blunt and
impolite.
For the British, he is a natural for Sir Humphrey Appleby from the
comedy television show Yes, Minister. Sir David says he has given up
defending himself, adding that even his mother-in-law makes the
comparison.
He is often called the ''schoolmaster'', a phrase coined by Malaysia's
ambassador Ismail Razali and not always used with affection.
Yet he is the favourite of the press by a long shot, always prepared
to explain the technicalities of obscure resolutions -- in French as
well as in English -- in an organisation that has suffered from poor
public rleations.
He has not divulged plans for his future, but has said he leans toward
broadcasting because ''the public presentation of foreign policy is
quite important and often not terribly well done''.
His relationship with the United States has been complicated. During
the Gulf War both countries maintained identical positions on Iraq. With
US officials often constrained by Washington from breaking new policy
ground at the UN, the field was left wide open for Sir David to brief
the media daily, leading to jokes that Desert Storm was a British
operation.
He admitted freely on US public television that he had an easier time
during the Iraq controversy with then-US envoy Thomas Pickering than he
now does with Ambassador Madeleine Albright, particularly over the key
issue of Bosnia.
He was quick to denounce US statements on lifting the arms embargo on
Bosnia. ''That's not a policy. That's a reaction of irritation and of
powerlessness,'' he snapped.
With Security Council reform a constant discussion at the UN, Sir
David's high profile has nearly squashed all talk of removing Britain
from the council, criticised for being dominated by Europeans.
''He didn't just nail down the seat, he welded it in place,'' said one
diplomat.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>BT rings upa rise of 11.9%</HEADLINE>

FIRST-quarter profits of BT to end-June have emerged comfortably above
the top end of analysts' expectations at the pre-tax level, up 11.9%
from the same period last year from #781m to #874m. The company is
benefiting from its association with US telecoms group MCI in which it
acquired a 20% stake last autumn. Redundancy costs also fell from #54m
to #22m with 800 people leaving the group.
Yesterday's figures came only a day after telephone industry regulator
Oftel announced plans to allow BT to raise line rents by as much as it
wants. But the company has already said it will not simply increase
rents as a result of the price cap being lifted.
This will allow the company to be more flexible and design bills more
suited to individual needs. However, critics still pointed to a profit
for the company of #111 a second and called for across the board
reductions in telephone line rental charges.
Oftel, headed by Don Cruickshank, believes that its decision to lift
the cap will increase competition in the industry. And he is confident
that pressure from Mercury and cable companies wil force BT to keep a
tight rein on its line rental charges.
After stripping out the contribution from MCI -- the two companies
have set up Concert, a joint venture which is bidding for international
communications contracts from multinationals -- and also redundancy
charges, actual operating profits rose by barely 2% and chairman Sir
Iain Vallance warned: ''A slowing UK economy and increasing competitive
pressures will continue to impact on growth.''
This cut no ice with critics from the Labour Party and the National
Consumers Council. NCC director Ruth Evans said: ''These figures yet
again prove that BT is doing very well and could easily afford to pass
on some of these profits to its domestic customers. This strengthens our
argument that customers deserve to see further reductions in their

Share markets, though, paid more heed to Sir Iain's note of caution

THE market showed its dissatisfaction in no uncertain fashion with
yesterday's package from Sir Trevor Chinn's Lex Services, lopping 23p
off Britain's biggest car dealer to 327p by the close, though at one
time the price had fallen as low as 319p.
In particular this reflected a disappointing first-half performance
but there were also some dilution worries over a cash-call to
shareholders.
Lex is making a one-for-six rights issue at 280p a share to raise #44m
as part payment for its purchase of Multipart, a supplier of replacement
parts for for Leyland and DAF trucks and LDV vans, for #73m. It will pay
#62m in cash for the company, #6m by the issue of loan notes, and #5m in
ordinary shares. Lex will also be taking on #12m worth of debt.
An uninspring car market left profits marking time at #22m before
exceptionals and tax. This compared with best expectations of #25m.
Private car registrations fell 7% on weak consumer demand, although
fleet registrations continued to grow.
Margins remained under pressure in all areas of the business.
Shareholders, though, get a sweetener with the interim dividend lifted
from 5.6p to 6p.

CERTAIN problems seem to trickle down through generations. The best
way of providing young people with the appropriate skills to move into
higher education and the workplace is still exercising the minds of both
educationalists and politicians.
When I was at secondary school in the 1980s I was involved in an
initiative called the Schools/Industry Link Scheme which entailed
spending several days on site in various major manufacturing companies.
This does not sound a million miles away from what Education Secretary
Gillian Shephard is proposing for 14-year-olds in England and Wales. My
scheme was the brainchild of an enlightened male chemistry teacher who
was keen to get more girls to follow a career in science and
engineering.
This was in stark contrast to the female headmistress of my girls'
grammar school who thought we should all go to Oxford to read history or
music as she had done. The initiative did not work for me in the sense
that my entire working career has been as a financial journalist,
although I did read science at university.
Several of my fellow pupils did take up careers in science and now
work for a variety of organisations such as ICI and the Atomic Energy
Authority. Despite my career path, the experience gained by spending
time in various major companies was valuable.
However, even that experience did not prepare me entirely for the
transition into work, an experience heightened with a simultaneous move
down to London. It's the little things that people do not tell you
about, like the Sunday evening ritual of ironing five shirts to wear the
following week. Moving from education into the media, a relatively
relaxed and sociable profession, was an eye-opener. It must be even
harder for those faced with starting work in a hierarchical office
environment or on the factory floor.
From being in a relaxed, youthful educational environment, where
pretty much anything goes in terms of dress and behaviour, the new
employee is suddenly faced with a need to adopt more conservative dress
codes and learn how to interact with a wide range of people of differing
ages and qualifications.
Given the rapid changes that are taking place in the work environment
in terms of both new technology and different forms of working, it is
arguable how much of any real use can be taught to students by teachers
who themselves are not really aware of the realities of working in a
modern workplace.
My career guidance from school was minimal, which was perhaps not
surprising given that teachers made no attempt to keep up with
developments in the employment market. Little seems to have changed in
the intervening years, judging from the large number of students leaving
school and college with no idea what they want to do.
The days when young people could walk into a number of jobs of their
choosing are long gone and there seems little chance of them
reappearing. This makes it all the more important that young people
receive as much information as possible about various career options
early enough for them to make an informed choice and focus their
education and training accordingly.
There is certainly a case for a properly run scheme of work experience
for students of all abilities. This could cover skills such as basic
accounting, learning new computer software packages, how to write a
report, chair a meeting, work in teams, and use foreign languages in a
business context.
This could play a vital role in helping students get a feel for the
type of work they might want to do at a later stage. It is also more
relevant to the tasks that they might actually have to perform in the
workplace.
The classroom-based National Vocational Qualifications, though still
in their infancy, are certainly a step in the right direction. One
subject area that addresses a real need in the market-place is leisure
and tourism. There are currently around 1,500,000 people working in
tourism. This and other service industries are growing at the expense of
manufacturing. Many schools, with their strict adherence to a
traditional curriculum, fail to pass on the skills necessary for
employment in the service sector.
Maybe it's time that formal contracts between parents and schools were
drawn up. One element of such a contract could be for the school,
parents, and pupil to sit down at the age of say 13 or 14, identify what
the pupil's interests are and devise some form of individual education
programme which offers vocational as well as more traditional teaching.
Although not written in stone, such a programme may go some way to
addressing the needs of all pupils and help to ensure that fewer
children feel that school is a waste of time.

ALLAN LAING previews a television show which proves males north of the
Border are a breed unto their own
Scottish men get anxious about how they are perceived
THERE is a school of thought which suggests that a television
programme about Scottish men -- investigating their desires, their
fears, their anxieties, their opinions, their very concept of life and
love -- could be adequately covered by a two-minute slot between News at
Ten and the weather forecast. Maybe a Tennents' lager advert would
suffice.
We are talking here about a species to whom the phrase ''male
bonding'' means slapping superglue on to the toilet seat seconds before
their best mate goes for a Greyfriars Bobby. To whom the term ''blind
date'' means the perfect woman (one with a white stick and a guide dog)
who will, God bless her, never be in a position to pass judgment on
their physique.
Ah, the Scottish male. Don't you just love us, girls? Can't live with
us; can't put us up against a wall and shoot us. The things you see when
you don't have a boa constrictor in your handbag.
And then again. Perhaps not. Fresh from her undoubted success with
Scottish Women, presenter Kaye Adams turns her attention to their male
counterparts in the somewhat predictably titled Scottish Men, a six-part
series which starts on Tuesday.
Now the obvious thing to do, of course, would be to follow the same
formula. Find a sexy subject and a couple of big-mouth experts, fill a
studio with (in this case) blokes, and get them all to talk till the
cows come home. Reliable, inexpensive, and reasonably entertaining
television.
But no. We have a problem. Men, as Adams was first to find out, are
somewhat different from women. Men, or rather Scottish men, are happy to
appear on a discussion programme and pontificate about politics or
sport. But ask them to sit there and talk about themselves, and you are
on a hiding to nothing.
They will run a mile before getting involved with that particular can
of worms. Women, on the other hand, are more than happy to publicly
express their feelings (as the Scottish Women series has proven). Maybe
it's an anal retentive thing, you'd have to ask a psychologist.
According to Ms Adams, it is more a question of fear. Not necessarily
fear of the camera -- though that may be part of it -- it is more a male
fear of making a complete haddock of himself in front of his mates who,
he knows, will be watching at home.
The presenter says: ''The problem is that it is not a very Scottish
thing for men to want to put themselves up like that. They get
incredibly anxious about how they are perceived, and they get worried
about getting shot down.''
So Scottish Men is different. Very different. Armed with audience
research figures which showed that almost as many men as women watch the
Scottish Women programme, Scottish Television decided that there was a
need for a masculine version.
So the last thing you'll find in Scottish Men is a studio discussion.
The closest you'll come to it is the occasional cameo appearance of a
group of verbose chaps (namely film maker David Hayman, TV reporter John
Nicolson, journalist Alan Chadwick, businessman Ivan Tiefenbrun, and
lawyer Len Murray) sitting round a dinner table drinking a few glasses
of vino and chewing the fat with some man-talk. Life, the universe, and
whose turn it is to buy the drink.
The rest is filmed on location. As it happens, so to speak. The result
is a fast-moving, funny, and thoroughly entertaining show. The first in
the series, Scottish Men Exposed, is really a scene setter. Kaye goes
camping with The Saddle Tramps, a group of Edinburgh men who spend their
weekends buddy-buddying it in the Great Outdoors. Have bicycle clips,
will travel.
Then there's a round-up of the usual suspects; interviews with men
like Ian Pattison, creator of Rab C. Nesbitt, and Scottie McClue, Scot
FM's answer to Freddie Kruger, talking about what it's like to be a
bloke in the nineties.
But it is not until the second programme that the series really gets
moving. Liam Kidd is a 23-year-old financial consultant, a good-looking
guy with a trendy haircut, and a smart line in shmutter. A bit of a
Jack-the-lad, he can clearly charm the birds off the trees -- and
proceeds to do so with Kaye and an inobtrusive camera crew there to
capture the moments.
Kaye, who is old enough to be, well, let's be kind and say Liam's much
older sister, hangs out with the lad and his mates of a Friday evening
as they tour Glasgow's wine bars and clubs. This is, not to put too fine
a point upon it, an examination of the art of pulling a bird.
One of Liam's pals has a few golden rules when it comes to women.
''Stay away from the money-grabbers, the ones that get wrecked every
night, and the ones that are a wee bit too loud,'' he says. After that
it's pretty much open season. Then, of course, there comes the tongue
test. If, while kissing, the young lady is prepared to open her mouth
then she is well worth the taxi fare home. If the teeth remain firmly
shut then forget it. Apparently.
Do you think you'll find the woman you love in a place like this, Kaye
asks Liam in a corner of some trendy club. No, he replies. He'll
probably find her in Safeway's.
Liam, a nice chap, is obviously on the side of New Man. Still, there
is at least one wee chap interviewed who restores your faith in the
Scots male species. Standing on the dance floor of Victoria's nightclub
in Glasgow, that well-known stamping ground of the ageing lothario, he
explains to Kaye Adams that he had just that very night split up with
his girlfriend.
''Are you sad about that?'' she asks.
''Well, I wouldn't say I was sad, exactly,'' he replies. ''I dropped
her off at her house at five to twelve and I was up here by five past.''
Scottish men, don't you just love us.

THE Queen Mother toured a flower show in style and comfort yesterday
on a golf buggy.
It was believed to be the first time the Queen Mother, 95 next week,
had used an electric buggy, driven by an equerry, in public. She was
visiting Sandringham Flower Show.
She arrived with the Prince of Wales in an open carriage for the
90-minute visit.
After being greeted by the show's organising committee, she walked 50
yards into a marquee full of flowers, where the buggy was waiting.
The Queen Mother, who had walked with the help of a cane, clearly
enjoyed the new experience of riding through the marquee and stopping to
chat to judges and exhibitors.
Then she emerged, still on the buggy, into the sunshine to cheers and
applause from a crowd of nearly 20,000.
Among dozens of gifts of flowers were early birthday presents and
cards which were all piled into the carrier on the back of the vehicle.
Prince Charles made his tour on foot, spending about half an hour in
the flower tent.
The royal visitors shared a laugh when Charles got too near the buggy
and risked the wheels running over his toes as the Queen Mother waved
him out of the way.

Elizabeth Buie discovers why it's time to pay some attention to our
home-grown inventors
LIKE a lament, the call is being taken up by engineers and inventors
from every corner of Britain: why do you neglect us?
While the ideas are still there, British industry is not prepared to
make the long-term investment into research and development. Instead,
foreign companies send their representatives to pore over the files in
the Patents Library and pluck out ideas to exploit.
Professor Arthur Cracknell, of Dundee University's Department of
Applied Physics and Electronic and Mechanical Engineering, blames the
accountants at the head of British companies for being more interested
in playing the Stock Market than investing in technology.
He points to the work on silicon devices which ultimately led to the
production of solar-powered pocket-calculators -- technology developed
by Professor Walter Spear and Professor Peter LeComber -- from his
department 20 years ago, spurned by British industry and developed by
the Japanese.
''British industry did not want to know about it. It was not a
question of money. The Japanese were looking around for scientific
discoveries which they could commercialise and work up to production
capacity, and British industry was more interested in being run by
accountants,'' he says.
From recent visits to parts of South-east Asia, he has concluded that
manufacturing industries moved there from the West because of the cheap
labour and tax incentives available. But as some of those industries
become automated, there should be no reason why new automated lines
could not be set up just as easily in Western Europe.
According to Cracknell, however, that will not happen as their
activities are better nurtured and appreciated by the people and
governments of the various South-east Asian countries.
Brian Gamble, the director of programmes at the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, agrees with Cracknell's analysis. But
also blames the scientists for not putting their case strongly enough.
He points the finger accusingly at the City. The money men will not
invest in research technology because they want a return within two to
four years, not 10.
In Japan, by contrast, many of the major companies have tie-ups with
banks and so finance is virtually on tap.
Others suggest that in the Far East, companies are allowed to set up
new production lines which may take seven years to write off, but in
Britain, as soon as there is an investment in product technology, the
share price drops because the City sees an immediate effect on the
profit and loss account.
Paul Ambridge, chairman of the Institute of Patentees and Inventors,
believes there is a fundamental problem in Britain in the way we regard
engineers and inventors.
He adds that as an engineer, he had spent more time in university and
industry qualifying than a doctor does, but doctors and lawyers are
still given more status.
In the UK, 20,000 patents are taken out by people living in the UK
every year, costing about #100m to develop at #5000 each. About 80% of
these are taken out by companies or institutions, and the remaining 4000
are taken out by individuals.
''In the UK, the success rate of turning a patent into a product in
the marketplace is about 2%, so each year, but only 400 result in
products.''
He points to the case of one member of his institute who invented a
clockwork radio. He took it round a number of UK companies, but none
were interested. It is now being produced in South Africa, partly with
funding from the Overseas Development Agency.
''Transistors were developed in this country -- they were invented
here. What has happened now? The UK does not have a transistor
industry,'' says Ambridge.
He believes the problem lies with Britain's Empire mentality -- the
conviction that whatever you produce, someone somewhere will buy it.
Other countries are better than Britain at finding out what the
marketplace needs and then developing the product to meet the need.
Critics of Britain's industrial performance call for better long-term
planning, a change in attitudes to the engineering profession, the
ability of the money markets to look further than the next day's share
price, and an end to Britain's brains being drained elsewhere.
Ambridge claims that while once, Japan and its Far-east neighbours
specialised in improving on other people's designs, that trend is being
reversed. Graphs now show that they are taking up more and more patents,
while the UK and Western Europe is static.
This week he put his money where his mouth is and shifted his
investments from Japan to South-east Asia. ''That is where the growth is
going to go,'' he declares.

THERE is a first time for everything and, if you are lucky, this first
time will happen to you too. By lucky, I mean provided you live long
enough, because otherwise it won't. It is the day somebody uses the
words ''senior citizen'' in your hearing -- and they mean you.
For years I have used a network card which, for a fee, allows
one-third off rail travel on what used to be British Rail's Network
South East -- heaven knows what it is called today, apart from rude
words.
When you reach 60 you can, for #16, have a similar card which allows a
discount over the entire UK rail network. Take evidence of eligibility
with you when applying, like your birth certificate or your passport,
the application form said. Quite right too, I thought, looking in the
mirror. I needn't have bothered. The man did not trouble to ask. One
look was enough. So much for that mirror.
As if that were not bad enough, it was when I bought my first ticket
with the thing that the dread words senior citizen were first used. They
take some getting used to, although I suppose it means I can now stay
seated on all public transport unless the other person is visibly
infirm.
This ageing process raises all sorts of issues. Familiarity is said to
breed contempt, although one could equally argue that it actually
creates sound judgment since it gives a basis on which to build
comparisons. It is unfamiliarity which leads to error.
Take the grass on the other side of the fence, for instance. Take
Tuscany -- the British have in droves -- which is where I am at the
moment. Were I not a regular visitor I would be sitting in paradise, in
a land which is civilised, picturesque, romantic, full of historic
cities, splendid architecture, spectacular villages, glorious paintings,
villas to die for, where the food melts in the mouth, the climate is
balmy, the mosquitoes eat you to death, and -- there is always a snag --
there are hordes of tourists, some of whom live there full time. But I
know better.
The visiting tourist, like me, may be a nuisance, but the worst we do
is cause a queue at the butchers or the bakers as we try to speak the
language like good Europeans. The resident tourist puts up house prices,
complains when the natives walk over his property, as they have done for
generations, is rude about national television, insisting the BBC is
better -- nobody ever talks about Carlton at times like this -- and
destroys the social values which brought him there in the first place by
writing travel books about his new home.
Maybe the days when we stayed at home, holidaying somewhere 30 miles
away, were better. There was all the world of difference between Lanark
and the likes of Ayr, Largs, Elie or Castle Douglas and there were no
language problems. The grass was greener, but it was on the same side of
the fence.
This is the time of year when senior citizens who have temporarily
leapt the fence, like I have at the moment, start to dream of castles in
Spain, gites in the Dordogne, or farmhouses in Umbria. They seem just
the place in which to spend your declining years, you reflect as you sit
there in the sunset knocking back the estate-bottled wine which won't
travel at 70p a flagon -- house prices are reasonable, the people
friendly, and John Major isn't Prime Minister. Who could ask for
anything more?
What you forget is that other countries have grotesque planning laws
operated by Jobsworths every bit as appalling as any we have, lawyers
just as crooked. The thing about the post-war travel revolution is it
has meant one is no longer the victim of unfamiliarity. One has spent
sufficient two weeks in other countries to know better than to succumb
to that dream of owning a foreign property.
Never to have left Scotland, once the rule, except for those who
emigrated for economic reasons, meant not being in a position fully to
appreciate its charms -- and disadvantages. It is possible to do
something about the latter, and there are ardent nationalists for whom
the kailyard is, was, and always will be paradise. But without something
to compare paradise with, how do you know it is one?
So what does the senior citizen do? Not that I am planning to retire
just yet, but I would be daft were I not, like Fagin, reviewing the
situation. I am also in a potentially dangerous situation, being in a
particularly appealing part of Italy, because foreign parts tend to be
awfully attractive when you know you are not stuck in them for good.
Not that I am in favour of returning to one's birthplace, especially
if one has lived away from from it longer than in it. Not only will it
have changed out of all recognition behind your back, there is not much
point in returning to spend one's old age in a place one spent one's
youth trying to get the heck out of, and never much liked in the first
place.
PERHAPS one should opt for some corner of a foreign field that could
be forever Scotland, but familiarity with foreign fields means that one
knows the risks of settling overseas and the wisdom of deciding upon
one's native land.
So there you are, some home thoughts from abroad about abroad. Has
anybody any views on Peebles?

Jimmy Reid explains that Labour without the unions would become just
another party -- and warns why abandonment would be short-sighted folly
The trade unions can survive without the Labour Party. Can Labour
survive without the trade unions? I think not
TALK about biting the hand that feeds you, fed you, nurtured you
through good times and bad, and even gave you that most precious of
gifts, life. Well, that is New Labour's attitude to trade unions.
The Labour Party and the trade unions are indivisible. Without
socialism, already abandoned, and the trade unions, about to be
abandoned, Labour is just another party. Its unique historic role and
relevance is being dumped, and without these Labour will wither and die,
for who needs another Tory or Liberal party.
In the short term Labour's leadership wants to keep the unions at a
distance (they are deemed electorally embarrassing), but still within
the fold, for their money is currently needed to keep the party afloat
and to fund the next General Election. In the longer term a Blair
Government would legislate for the state funding of parties, and the
unions will then be ditched.
Yet the trade unions were fundamental in founding Labour and played a
key role in shaping its destiny as a reforming party of government based
on socialist ideals. In their hour of greatest need, following the
carnage of Thatcherism, they are treated like pariahs by a party it
founded to represent the interests of organised labour. As an act of
ingratitude this takes some beating, and it's short-sighted folly as
well.
The trade unions can survive without the Labour Party. Can Labour
survive without the trade unions? I think not, and for reasons which
have little to do with money.
We can only marvel at the gross insensitivity of those who have taken
a cleaver to the finely evolved structures of what was a pluralist
political party uniquely designed for the task of changing Britain for
the better through a democratic parliamentary process. This has been a
century of social upheaval and turbulent technological change which
wrought havoc in the economic and political landscape of our planet.
Human kind in the past 100 years has acquired more information than in
the previous 10,000 years. Our technology has outstripped our sociology.
In the midst of potential abundance millions have starved to death. Many
millions more socially alienated. It has been a century of colonialism,
fascism, communism, political convulsions, two world wars, countless
''lesser'' wars and in Bosnia the beasts are once again on the march.
In certain parts of the world it brought a general level of material
living standards never seen before. This happened in Britain which was
very much involved in colonialism and the two world wars. Yet through
these years there was relative social stability. The recently
much-maligned old Labour Party was a major factor in ensuring that the
fight for change in this country was channelled through the ballot box
and civil war as a means of social change was eschewed.
It was able to do this because of its nature, its character, which
were determined by its founding fathers. The TUC at its congress in
September 1899, passed a resolution ''to invite the co-operation of all
the co-operative, socialistic, trade union, and other working-class
organisations to jointly co-operate on lines mutually agreed upon, in
convening a special congress of representatives from such of the
above-named organisations as may be willing to take part to devise ways
and means for securing the return of an increased number of Labour
members in the next Parliament''.
Congress referred this resolution for further elaboration and
implementation to a special joint committee comprising four members of
its Parliamentary Committee, Will Thorne and W C Steadman, supporters of
a new party of Labour, and Sam Woods and Robert Bell, who were Liberals,
the Independent Labour Party was represented by Keir Hardie and Ramsay
McDonald, the Social Democratic Federation by Harry Quelch and H R
Taylor, and the Fabians by George Bernard Shaw and E R Pease.
Their deliberations resulted in a conference at the Memorial Hall,
Farringdon Street, London, on Tuesday, February 27, 1900 which
effectively founded the Labour Party. Present were 129 delegates
representing 65 trade unions and three socialist societies.
At this founding congress it was agreed that an executive committee of
seven trade union representatives, two each from the ILP and the SDF and
one from the Fabians should be elected not by congress as a whole but by
their organisations.
This established Labour as a federal party. The broad kirk. A
federation of trade unions and socialist societies with their own
identities and their own directly elected executive members. A coalition
of social forces. The trade unions organised workers who were non
socialists as well as those who were. They tended to act as a restraint
on the idealism of the socialist societies.
On the other hand the economism and narrow ''practicalism'' of some
trade unions were subject to trenchant criticism by the socialist
societies. The tensions thus generated from these two wings of the party
were dynamic, and often resolved in a postive synthesis.
The new party's structure ensured that it could not be an exclusively
class party. The trade unions provided a working-class base. The
socialist societies involved people of all classes attracted by the
vision of socialism. Many were middle-class intellectuals whose
contribution to the cause of Labour has been greatly under valued.
Labour could and did appeal to all that's good in the middle classes
without pandering to their baser elements.
There were no individual members of the Labour Party until 1918 when
the constitution was amended, but the federal principle was maintained.
Individual members joined a constituency party, not the national party,
and the constituency parties became part of the federation. They could
send delegates to the annual conference and elect their own
representatives to the executive.
National conference was the supreme policy-making body. The national
executive was the custodian of conference decisions. The Labour Party
was the most democratic party in Britain, arguably in the world, and
rose swiftly to become a party of government. Its core electoral base is
massive. The unprincipled wooing of those fundamentally alien to
Labour's core values is undermining that base.
The decisions of national conference are now ignored. The NEC is a
rubber stamp. The party machine is controlled by the leader's office.
The trade unions are diminished except as providers of money. New
members are being recruited through the national office. Dues paid by
bankers' order. Participation by the membership, in and through various
and varied affiliates, as part of the process of decision making, is
being rendered innocuous.
Changes were necessary. The democracy of the Labour Party was damaged
by those trade unions whose internal democracy was flawed. The election
or appointment of union leaders for life was outrageous. It should never
have required legislation to guarantee the rights of workers to a ballot
on whether they should go on strike. None of this, however, can obscure
the fact that trade unionism by its nature is more democratic than any
commercial or financial institution.
The monolithic block vote was an anachronism. Greater internal union
democracy could have broken down the block vote so that it could more
accurately reflect the views of the union membership.
But the bottom line was much more crude. The British economy was in
crisis. Thatcher needed a scapegoat. The unions were cast in that role.
Blamed for all our economic ills. This was preposterous but the scale
and ferocity of the attack intimidated Labour's leadership. There was no
robust and coherent defence of the unions, no critique that laid the
blame where it belonged, at the door of the real masters of the economy.
Labour's current leader is still recoiling from this onslaught. He
considers the unions to be an electoral liability, and in this is behind
the times. The pendulum has swung. In industrial disputes the public no
longer automatically blame the workers or their unions.
Tony Blair projects an image of even handedness. ''I'll listen,'' he
says, ''to unions and the employers,'' which is jolly sporting when you
consider the unions are part of the party he leads and pay affiliation
fees, and employers on the whole tend to do the opposite. But in fact
Blair talks tougher to the unions. Read what he said at the conference
of the TGWU and then compare it with his honeyed words to Rupert
Murdoch's top executives.
The Tories can be beaten at the General Election. The swing in British
politics today is against the crudities and cruelties of Thatcherism.
Labour can win people who previously voted Tory and now believe they
were wrong to do so. But Blair seems to be making a bid for
unreconstructed Tory votes which can only be successful if he persuades
them that Labour is a party of newly constructed Tories.
Some party members tell me that it's all a Machiavellian ploy. Once
elected he will start introducing more socialist policies. That I
suggest is naive in the extreme. This guy is dead serious. He is
dismantling the party that presided over the most far-reaching social
changes in the history of our country without recourse to violence or
social strife. We do not appreciate the significance of this
achievement.
Labour's federal structure diffused power through affiliates. This
developed an internal democratic culture. No Labour Prime Minister was
ever as dictatorial as Thatcher. No Labour leader has ever been as
dictatorial within the party as Mr Blair. He obviously admires
Thatcher's Caligulan imperiousness and has been practising it on trade
unions before donning the toga of number 10.
Labour can win without surrendering everything it believes in, but if
the price of victory is that Labour becomes the heirs of Thatcher, then
it's a price too far. Such a government would finish Labour.

Christopher Dobson considers the likely candidates and motives behind
the bombing which rocked the Metro station of Saint Michel
THE French are notorious for making deals with terrorists: a light
sentence for an assassin in exchange for the freeing of hostages; an
arrangement where a blind eye is turned to a group's activities in
return for immunity for French interests or a trade deal as reward for
the quiet expulsion of an embarrassing terrorist. These are all part of
France's ''pragmatic'' approach to terrorism.
And yet Paris is the target of more acts of terrorism than any other
capital in the West -- especially now the IRA has halted its attacks
against London.
The French, it seems, cannot avoid making a succession of deadly
enemies who spring from their aggressive, modern foreign policies and
the remnants of their colonial past. These men are just as pragmatic as
the French and see France's willingness to do deals with them as an
encouragement to plant their bombs rather than a restraint.
So who was it this time? Who planted the bomb in the Saint Michel
Metro station in the shadow of Notre Dame? The list of candidates is
long: the Algerians, the Serbians, nuclear protesters, friends of Carlos
the Jackal, the Corsicans, the Basques. They all have their reasons for
wanting to cause mayhem in Paris.
Security officials regard the ferocious militants of the Armed Islamic
Group (GIA), the most radical of Algeria's Muslim fundamentalists, as
the most likely people to have planted the bomb. They have been fighting
for nearly four years to set up an Islamic republic in Algeria after the
Government cancelled the election which the Islamists seemed bound to
win.
France gave its support to the Algerian Government and since then the
militants have waged war against the ''unbelievers''. In all 84
foreigners have been murdered, 30 of them French. Last December GIA
members hijacked an Air France Airbus from Algiers and forced the pilot
to fly to Marseilles where the plane was stormed by French police
commandos. It was then revealed that the hijackers were on a suicide
mission. They planned to crash the plane and its passengers into the
heart of Paris.
A week after the hijacking the Islamic Salvation Front, supposedly
less blood-thirsty than the GIA, fulminated: ''The mujahideen of the AIS
are capable of hitting France in her own house and the days to come will
show, with the help of God, their capacity to smite the unbelievers.''
In January British Special Branch officers who had been keeping
surveillance on a militant living in London sent a telex to Paris
warning that he was crossing to France, and was possibly planning an act
of terrorism but, because the telex was sent in English it was not
translated in time for the French to act. Could he have been responsible
for Saint Michel?
The French Government retaliated to all this hostile activity by
rounding up and deporting suspects from the Algerian community. Only
last month dozens of the ''madmen of God'' were detained in co-ordinated
raids in Paris, Orleans, Marseilles and other cities.
Given this background, it does seem that Algeria, the former colony
whose fight for freedom brought France to the verge of civil war could
once again be the source of pain and anguish for the French.
The Serbs would also have cause to think themselves justified in
''hitting France in her own house''. President Chirac's pugnacious call
for the recapture of Srebrenica and a tough military response to Serb
aggression has gained for France the reputation of being the most
hawkish of the ''peace-keepers''. It is believed that the French mounted
a laser-bomb raid on the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale this week in
revenge for the death of two French soldiers in a Serb mortar attack on
their positions.
Paradoxically, it is the French, angered at UN vacillation, who are
threatening to pull out of Bosnia altogether. So, it is possible that
the Serbs planted the Saint Michel bomb not only out of revenge but to
encourage the French to withdraw.
Certainly the Serbs are no strangers to such acts of terrorism, but it
would serve no purpose unless they acknowledged their responsibility and
then the retribution wreaked on them by a furious Chirac could make them
regret it.
Another possibility is someone connected to Illich Ramirez Sanchez,
otherwise known as Carlos the Jackal, the Venezuelan assassin who is now
languishing in a Paris jail after being handed over to the French by his
Sudanese friends. His gang have a history of using bombs in order to
secure the release of their friends. In 1982 two members of his gang,
the German Bruno Breguet and Carlos's lover Magdalena Kopp were arrested
by French police as they prepared for a terrorist operation.
The remnants of his gang would have no scruples about setting off a
bomb in the Metro as a way of putting pressure on the French Government
to release him. But, just like the Serbs, this would serve no purpose
unless they announced their identity and their demands. It is always
possible, of course, that whoever was responsible has made their demands
known and they are being kept secret by the authorities.
The next candidates are people who have forsworn violence, people from
all over the world who are protesting against France's renewal of
nuclear weapons testing on the Mururoa atoll.
Devoted to peaceful protest, these people would seem unlikely to carry
out such an outrage.
Who else? Well, there are the Corsican nationalists, hard-pressed by
Commissaire Mireille Ballestrazzi, the so-called Ice Doll, who has
rounded up many of their leaders and cleaned up the island. They have
normally confined their activities to Corsica but the effect of a bomb
in Paris may seem to them proper revenge for their current tribulations.
The Basques also have cause to strike at the French authorities. For
years the ETA group, fighting for independence from Spain could be sure
of sanctuary in Basque territory on the French side of the border,
knowing that the French would not interfere with them. That changed,
however, under pressure from the EU, and in a series of combined
operations the French and Spanish police arrested most of the ETA
leadership. The bomb may be an act of ETA revenge.
Given all the evidence, the Algerian fundamentalists look to be the
prime suspects.
If the Algerians are responsible two grave dangers face the French
Government. The first is that this is only the first bomb in a campaign
similar to that of 1982 when Lebanese/Iranian terrorists brought Paris
to a state of panic. The second is the threat of mass civil disorder
with angry Frenchmen attacking Algerians and resurrecting the bitterness
of the Algerian war which did so much harm to France.

DEMENTIA is not a subject for humour. But here goes. A document lands
on our desk. It is entitled Planning for Community Dementia Services in
Barking and Havering. Barking and Havering, in this context, are not
symptoms but boroughs in the deep south of England.
It seems entirely appropriate that the above areas should share a
health authority. And that they should be at the leading edge of dealing
with dementia.
Among the interesting facts in the Barking and Havering dossier is
that they have a ''Joint Officer Team -- Older People'' and that 34% of
women over 90 years old suffer from dementia.
To excuse this outbreak of bad taste, we have a note from the
consultant psychiatrist who sent us a copy of the report: ''As we all
know, the subject of dementia is a serious and distressing one but light
relief in what can often be a distressing field to work is very
welcome.'' Or, as we say in the Diary, if you're suffering from
dementia, just go home and forget about it.
* STILL on the subject of barking and havering, the Diary was very
much cheered to hear that Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth has
appointed Gerald Warner of the Sunday Times Scotland as his special
adviser.
It is long overdue that Gerald, an Old Aloysian and an unreconstructed
Tory Tim, was preserved by the nation -- even if it is going to cost us
taxpayers #40,000 a year.
The Diary was surprised to see that Mr Warner believes the Scottish
media is terminally bigoted. This certainly could not be said of Mr
Warner. He is a staunch advocate of the traditional Latin Mass and
traditional Roman Catholic values.
We seem to recall a social event in Glasgow where Mr Warner enacted
his very own Orange walk in the lobby with a very convincing rendition
of The Sash. A lad o' pairts indeed.
Near miss
OVERHEARD in a bar in Troon, two strangers having a chat. After the
usual pleasantries, one says to the other: ''And what is it you do for a
living.''
''I work in air traffic control,'' is the reply.
''Well, you've made a right arse of Ayr town centre,'' is the
response.
THE Diary is an avid reader of wedding magazines. Well, not really,
but we are in receipt of an advertisement in a publication called
Bride's Collection. Amid all the wedding gowns and rings and things, it
stands out with the heading: ''Marrying a Catholic? How could you?''
It turns out to be a proselytising message from the Catholic Enquiry
Centre and the answer to the question is: ''Quite easy really, despite
some of the tales you hear.''
In a magazine called Scottish Brides we find an advert for a designer
and dressmaker called Sash. No, not of Larkhall; it is based in
Haddington.
* ALSO in the wedding magazine Bride's Collection we find an article
headed ''Forsyth -- The Perfect Choice''. Forsyth, we are told, has a
''combination of virtues'' including robust strength, contemporary chic,
and, would you believe it, translucent beauty. We are also told that:
''A posy of freesias emphasises Forsyth's freshness and purity.''
Forsyth, in case you are getting confused, is a dinner service
produced by Royal Doulton china.
Party poser
THE Labour Party is having problems answering the question, ''so, what
exactly is the United Kingdom?'' Last week the party announced it wasn't
so sure about the idea of creating elected assemblies for the English
regions, and showed signs of uncertainty over what this all meant for
Scottish devolution. This week the party held a news conference to
launch its new regional policy commission. Appearing alongside deputy
leader John Prescott was our own former EU Commissioner Bruce Millan.
But when a member of the Diary's Westminster bureau turned up, a
Labour press person said: ''Don't bother. It's only about England and
Wales.'' Fair enough. Only, emblazoned on the pistachio-coloured
backdrop behind the speakers, for all to see, were the words: ''A
Regional Policy for Britain''.
Gazzateer
INTO the hands of the Diary falls a tome of previously unrecognised
literary talent. The Official Gazza Children's Annual, published in
1991, before the man himself migrated to this fair country, is a
veritable well of jokes, fascinating facts and quizzes.
We are told in the introduction: ''Despite the fame Paul has achieved
and the pressures that go with it, he still gives the impression of
being just another Geordie boy made good.'' Commenting on ''Nights
Out'', Paul has this to say: ''I usually prefer a quiet drink in my
local to a night out on the town. Sometimes when we get back from an
away game the players go out in London, and that is always a lot of
fun.''
The book also reveals that Gazza's Christian names are Paul and John,
which could be mischievously rearranged.
The annual also offers for sale a list of Gazza merchandise, including
a shell-suit and toothbrush with ''matching'' toothpaste.
Name Game
APROPOS of not a lot, one of our many moles at the Scottish Enterprise
offices in Bothwell Street brings to our attention that among the ranks
of staff employed therein there seems to be a distinct lack of national
identity. We are talking about the names of some of the women who work
there.
The staff directory lists Maretta, Cerise, Sasha, Severine, Dania,
Maryse, Nuala, Edel, Gini, Imelda, Tamara, Belle, Tara and Ute. And not,
as far as we know, a single Senga.

Visual Art
DECADE, at Glasgow's Street Level gallery, marks the 10th anniversary
of Glasgow Art School Fine Art Photography course.
Ten years ago there was no specialist photography gallery in Glasgow.
Street Level, which opened six years ago, recently moved to bigger,
better premises in Glasgow's King Street, where this exhibition runs
till Saturday.
However such is the climate in Glasgow that not all photographers work
with cameras and film or show photographs. Next door at Transmission
Gallery boundaries between media have never existed. Their current show,
In Stereo, features four artists. Both shows include video and contain
Glasgow artists from the recent New Art in Scotland at the CCA.
Decade is impressive. It's well curated and displayed, showing the
range and diversity of interest of Glasgow's photography graduates who
take chances and often practise their metier ''on the edge''.
At Street Level, fascinating film greets you at the door. Mark Dawes
has filled the gallery window with portholes where you watch swimmers as
though in an aquarium. Inside, Christine McBride's Castlemilk residency
has produced eye-catching fluorescent orange-curtained windows. Richard
Learoyd's studies of scrunched paper are beautiful too. Jim Hamlyn likes
the semi-opaque, usually water. This time it's polythene over doors and
gaps.
Elsie Mitchell's film about her auntie is a brilliant, very personal
account of a family dealing with mental illness across the generations.

Carole Woddis takes a sneak preview at the reconstructed Shakespeare
Globe theatre and finds its design will challenge both audiences and
actors
SAM WANAMAKER'S magnificent, reconstructed Shakespeare's Globe, now in
its final stages on London's Bankside and due to open its doors to the
public in two weeks' time with a season of workshops, has already
encountered its first drama.
On Tuesday this week, the still-under-construction Globe was due to
hold a press conference to announce its first artistic director. But a
sudden bevvy of leaked theatre stories last week in London's Evening
Standard (which also included the revelation that the Royal Court was
set to move into the West End in September for a four-month season),
actor Mark Rylance's name was trailed apparently before it had been
properly confirmed by the Globe's board.
Result: cancelled press conference and embarrassment all round,
especially since the Standard's story also included a tale of clashing
egos between Rylance and one of the new trustees to the Globe board --
none other than the Shakespeare man and RSC founder himself, Sir Peter
Hall. Hall, apparently has already voiced severe reservations about the
Globe's viability as anything other than a Bardic tourist trap.
Certainly the Globe -- an exact replica or as near it considering the
lapse and developments of 400 years -- looks set to pose some
considerable logistical problems, and may indeed have a hard time
balancing its touristic attractions against its aesthetic ones.
Some sight lines in the three-sided stage mean that part of the
audience sits almost behind the actors while attracting several hundred
''groundlings'' -- literally those who will stand on the ground to
watch, immediately in front of the stage -- is not going to be easy in
our often inclement climate and in an age grown soft on convenience.
But The Globe, a glimmer merely in the eye of its begetter 25 years
ago, would never have reached this stage without the special tenacity
and vision of Wanamaker, a Shakespeare enthusiast determined to see the
work of England's leading playwright in his own space near to where it
was first seen and heard.
As it is, Wanamaker's thatched roof dream -- the first thatched
building in London since the Great Fire in 1666 -- is a monument to
age-old almost forgotten skills. Fire-proofed for safety in all areas,
the wooden ''O'' has involved dozens of craftsmen and women using
authentic materials and tools such as clay brick, lime plaster, and
English oak for joints and frames to recreate the Tudor building.
Holding 1500 when completed, including three galleries of bench
seating and the 500 ''groundlings'', the auditorium itself already sets
up an extraordinary atmosphere. Open to the sky and with little in the
way of scenery, though large it also engenders a terrific sense of
intimacy, and is undoubtedly going to present one of the most intriguing
theatrical challenges to audience and practitioners alike.
How, for example, will actors used to the techniques of television
acting acclimatise themselves to projecting into a theatre open to the
winds -- and the sounds -- of the city? And how will audiences take to a
theatre as far away as possible from the pomp and spectacle associated
with so much contemporary classic and musical theatre?
Yet seeing the theatre as it nears completion, the thrill -- and the
potential -- of this new relationship between performer and audience
becomes obvious. We shall see what is on offer in two weeks' time when a
galaxy of directors and performers from home and abroad including Judi
Dench, Julian Glover, Brian Cox, Bill Bryden, and Japanese artists, give
their services free. They will explore such topics as the art of the
soliloquy, depicting battle and crowd scenes, and comparing acting in a
''proscenium'' theatre with styles in Shakespeare's time and the
Restoration period.
The Globe, however, still has one or two financial hurdles to
overcome. Despite the herculean task already achieved in raising
sufficient money to, at least, get the main theatre under way, more is
required to complete other parts of what, by 1999, will be the
self-financing International Shakespeare Centre.
''We can only build when we have the money,'' explained a Globe
spokeswoman to The Herald this week. ''We've asked for #12.4m from the
The Arts Council Lottery which is due to be announced on September 14
and if successful will go towards completion of both interiors of The
Globe and the second Indigo Jones theatre. If the money doesn't do come
through, plans will have to be put on ice until it is forthcoming.''
When it opens -- it is still on course for June 1996 -- it will run as
a summer season with performances twice a day from May-September,
Wednesday to Saturday, and once on Sunday. A veritable international
centre in fact, and a fitting tribute to two remarkable men.
* Shakespeare's Globe workshops run from August 9 to September 10.
Tickets #5 standing, #11 sitting available through Ticketmaster
(0171-344 4444 -- 24 hrs) or Globe box office 0171-401 9919.

ON MONDAY of this week Dr Sheila Brock took time off her holiday to go
back to work. As the campaign director of the Museum of Scotland project
she thought it might be thought crass not to welcome the latest posse of
visitors to campaign headquarters in person. After all it's not every
day you get the opportunity to chat up people with seven million odd
quid in their back pockets.
The representatives from the National Heritage Memorial Fund were
clearly impressed with what they saw. Scarcely 24 hours later, catching
their beneficiaries on the hop, they announced that they would give all
of the #7.2m requested in the received bid.
In truth it was even better that Dr Brock and her Royal Museums'
director Mark Jones could have hoped for. Thus far they have raised #5m
of the #14m-plus needed to fit out the new museum, scheduled to open to
the public in the autumn of 1998. Privately they thought the heritage
committee might decide at this stage to do no more than match that #5m,
with the rest contingent on the future success of fund-raising. Now the
raising of the final #2.2m seems assured, given the very public blessing
of the National Heritage endowment.
The tale of just how the campaign set about getting that all-important
first #5m from the private sector is an object lesson in variously
harnessing the networking ability of the Scottish nobility, the
notorious sentimentality of the Scottish diaspora, and the timeless
appeal of a footnote in Scottish history to human vanity.
What Dr Brock and her campaign team had going for them from the
beginning was a very marketable product . . . a home for the telling of
Scotland's story . . . and the imprimatur of Government approval. Former
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang cut the first turf in April 1993 setting the
seal on #30m of public money for the project.
That left just under #15m to fit out the interior from the very basic
necessities of restaurant and toilet facilities to the investment in
state-of-the-art information technology. MOSAICS (Museum of Scotland
Advanced Information Computer Systems) will harness the flexibility of
tools like CD-ROM not just to inform on-site visitors more thoroughly
about the historical profile and usage of artefacts, but also to allow
the most sophisticated form of distance-learning for students and
interested adults all over the country.
From the start the strategy was a shameless appeal to the sense of
Scottishness of potential supporters all over the world. No matter that
their last known family connection with the old country was 200 years
old. What an opportunity the museum was offering them to invest in their
roots! Thus it was that in February 1994 an icebreaker stoically cut a
path for the Royal Yacht Britannia in the Hudson River. After all this
regal flagship had been pressed into service to throw a party that
night. A party to which anyone and everyone who might help the cause had
been invited.
And a lot of homework had been done on the guest list. It didn't hurt
for instance that the Earl of Perth, chairman emeritus of the Patron's
Council, had an American wife whose address book could be seriously
plundered. Or that the current chair, the Countess of Dalkeith, was no
slouch at pulling a few aristocratic strings. The Americans, God bless
them, are irretrievable suckers for a title or two. And not only was the
Master of the Royal Household on board, but so too was Lord Perth, Lord
Fraser, the late Marquis of Bute's widow and younger son, and that not
uninfluential Fifer Sir Robin Renwick, Her Majesty's Government's
representative on American earth. Sir David and Lady Hannay, Britain's
UN ambassador and his wife were practically the only tartan-free zone in
the home team.
The guest list was equally glittery and certainly well-enough heeled
to devise ways of getting to the bash through the unhelpful blizzards
which had raged through New York all that day. From that inaugural event
sprang all kinds of essential contacts. Contacts which were to lead to a
New York-based fund-raising committee chaired by expatriate Scot Ian
Smith, of Marsh and McLennan, and indeed a New York office run by
Lindsay Hearn, of events' promoters George Treasure Associates.
That has proved crucial not just in keeping up the momentum of
American giving -- about 30% of the #5m came from overseas -- but in
helping to service the next prong of the transatlantic attack . . .
shaking down the St Andrew's societies.
A West Coast foray by Dr Brock and Lady Dalkeith has already resulted
in a $10,000 donation from the San Francisco branch, and their New York
equivalent are talking in terms of five times that. Given that
10,000,000 Americans claim Scots roots this could ultimately prove a
rich seam.
Meanwhile a committee of London Scots contains luminaries such as Sir
Ian Morrow of Hambros, Bill Morrison of British Linen, and Helena
Kennedy, QC.
They were out in force at the Commons last month when the Campaign
laid siege to possible parliamentary allies at a party hosted by Shadow
Chancellor Gordon Brown. One of the recruits to that southern support
group was the late Jean Muir, and Sheila Brock was both touched and
astonished to learn that she had requested those who mourned her to make
their posthumous tribute tangible in the shape of a cheque made out to
the museum fund. Now appeals have also been launched in Hong Kong and a
Canadian committee is on the drawing board.
Perhaps it was that breadth of support which so impressed the National
Heritage Memorial Commissioners. Perhaps it was the fact that the new
museum's treasures would be freely available to a visitor profile which
crosses all age groups and social classes. Or perhaps they just ''got
religion'' about the idea in much the same spectacular fashion as Mrs
Drue Heinz.
Mrs Heinz -- the woman who opened Hawthornden Castle near Edinburgh as
a writers' retreat in 1982 -- was moved to give #1m to the new museum.
In return her amazing generosity is to be recognised by naming the
triangular interior court in her honour. The good news for Doc Brock and
her team is that this means not the Heinz Court, but the Hawthornden
Court. After all, if you make a six-figure donation, who's going to
quibble with your designation?

A FORMER Argyll councillor has drowned in a rafting accident a year
after emigrating to America.
Mr Iain Bell, 48, was regional councillor for the Lorn and Mull ward
between 1990 and 1994.
He moved to Aztec, New Mexico, where the accident happened, after
marrying American Lee Charbonneau.
The pair took their wedding vows in New Mexico, followed by a ceremony
at St Conan's Kirk, Lochawe.
Originally from Glasgow, Mr Bell moved to Mull to work on a fish farm
before being elected to the council. He met his wife while she was at
Drummore Learning Centre in Oban on a two-year exchange scheme.
Mrs Norma Campbell, chairwoman of Oban Community Council, said: ''I'm
desperately sorry to hear of his death. We worked closely with him and
he was very helpful. The whole community council will join me in
sympathy for his wife.''
The Rev Andy Campbell, of Kilmore and Oban Church of Scotland, said:
''Iain had that rare gift of consistency, being the same person whether
in his role as councillor, good friend, or acquaintance.''

<HEADLINE>Community fears that US base will close</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CIVILIAN employees at the US Navy communications base near Edzell fear
they will be told today that the base is to close.
Almost 300 Scottish workers are employed at the RAF base which is run
by the US Naval Security Group. Redundancies and a halt to building work
on the base last year have added to the expectation that closure is
imminent. A statement is to be issued today.
With reduced superpower rivalry following the demise of the Soviet
Union and pressing domestic fiscal considerations, the Pentagon is
scheduled, in September, to post a list of bases to be closed.
Yesterday, the base commander, Captain Laurence Schaffer, declined to
comment on the purpose of today's briefing.
The US Navy first dropped anchor in the fertile Howe of the Mearns in
1960 and apprehensive local people were assured there would be ''no
missiles, planes, or radar''.
One officer and eight enlisted personnel comprised the entire strength
of the unit. Today, it numbers 900 personnel and 900 dependants,
dwarfing the village of Edzell and its 600 inhabitants.
The Americans have created their own Little America, in the heart of
Scotland, where the dollar is the currency. Pre-fabricated family houses
were shipped over from the States and Holiday Inn-style barracks have
been erected. In the Stars and Stripes bookshop, Time and Newsweek
compete with Soldier of Fortune, Gung Ho, and Eagle -- For the American
Fighting Man.
The base has its own junior school, commissary supermarket, beauty
parlour, movie theatre, baseball diamond, bowling alley, swimming pool,
and leisure facilities. An artificial loch, Loch Wee, was created to
provide trout fishing.
Code-named ''Comfy Cobalt' it is a popular posting with service
personnel and their families -- infinitely preferable to its Puerto
Rican sister-establishment, where the local liberation movement takes
pot shots at US service people.
In the 60s and 70s, the base was expanded rapidly to become an
advanced electronic satellite surveillance post to monitor the Soviet
fleet and specifically the activities of the Russian Navy's submarines.
Local hoteliers, garage proprietors, shopkeepers, and farmers, who
converted old cottar houses into modern cottage accommodation for the
Americans, were among the chief local beneficiaries.
It is estimated that the base pumps #20m into the local economy and
today's announcement is awaited with some foreboding.
Mr Barry Cale, owner of the Panmure Arms Hotel, said: ''I have been
predicting the closure of the base for two years. The redundancies that
have already taken place have brought a real down-turn in trade over the
last couple of years.
''We have three hotels and only 600 people. It's fairly obvious that
we cannot all survive.''
Ms Ann Watson, a shop assistant in the local Spar Shop, said: ''I will
fear for my job if the base closes. We get a lot of business from the
Americans.''
Today's announcement could herald the second superpower withdrawal
from Edzell. The last one, in 83 AD, came when the Romans abandoned the
most northerly fort in the Roman empire.
The Roman retreat came after fierce resistance from the ancient
Caledonians. Their modern-day descendants may not be quite so happy to
see the departure of the US Navy.

IT happened more than two centuries ago, it lasted for only about 40
minutes, and it still rouses fierce national passions in a haze of
romantic myths.
The latest controversy over remarks by the Duke of Argyll is a
reminder, if any were needed, that the Battle of Culloden remains an
emotive and contentious issue for many Scots. The duke's assertion that
the outcome was a good result for Scotland is not widely shared, despite
a growing awareness that Charles Edward Stuart was far from being the
gallant champion of Scots independence portrayed by some imaginative
writers and film-makers.
With the 250th anniversary of the battle falling on April 16 next
year, foreigners tracing their Scottish roots are likely to swell the
numbers of pilgrims visiting the site of the brief, bloody affair. Many,
inspired by the nationalist fervour of films such as Rob Roy and
Braveheart, will be hoping to find evidence of an ancestor having fought
valiantly for the Bonnie Prince in the last, glorious stand of the
Highland clans against brutal English oppressors.
A lot of them are in for a big disappointment. For the truth is that
there were probably more Scots in the Hanoverian ranks than in the
heavily outnumbered Jacobite army, and that arguably, in the long run,
it was a wise choice.
Americans by the name of Campbell will soon be disabused of any notion
that their clansmen were sporting white cockades when battle was joined
on what was then called Drummossie Muir, a broad ridge of moorland
between the River Nairn and the coastal plain east of Inverness. There
were two regiments of Campbells in the field, both of them on the
Royalist side, and one of them played an important role in breaking the
charge of the Atholl Brigade and Appin Stuarts with murderous flanking
fire.
Any Macdonalds from Chicago or Miami may find themselves in an
invidious position, historically speaking. The Macdonalds of Clanranald,
Keppoch, and Glengarry formed the left flank of the Highland army under
the command of Lord John Drummond -- but they didn't fight. They were
deeply offended at not being accorded their traditional privilege of
being on the right, facing the enemy, and remained sullen and impassive
when the right flank was decimated in a disastrous charge.
Even when Keppoch himself charged with a few followers, and was duly
felled by musket-balls, his men continued slashing at the grass with
their claymores. When Cumberland's men advanced, they simply turned
their backs and left the field. At least they acted more honourably than
the Macdonalds of Sleat, who hunted down and killed Jacobite survivors
of the massacre to ingratiate themselves with Cumberland.
The Hanoverian ranks also included Munros, Macleods, and at least
three Scots regiments, battle-hardened veterans of campaigns in Europe
-- the First of Foot, the Scots Fusiliers, and the Edinburgh Regiment.
The Scots Fusiliers in particular wrought havoc on the Highland army
with their musket fire.
There were Grants on both sides, and while most of the Farquharsons
were hurling themselves at the Royalists, a certain namesake with the
rank of lieutenant was directing artillery fire against them. One of his
fellow officers in the Company of Royal Artillery was called Macbean.
Visitors to Culloden by the name of Cameron, Mackintosh, Fraser,
Macpherson, and Mackenzie, may rest assured that their clansmen took the
field and fought with astonishing bravery in the Jacobite cause.
One John Mor McGillvray, a major of the Mackintoshes, is reputed to
have killed a dozen men with his broadsword while he was being run
through with halberds. A member of the same clan is recorded as having
killed seven Englishmen with the tram of a peat-cart before being
overpowered. Another Highlander of prodigious strength, one Golice
Macbane, too badly wounded to flee with his comrades, is said to have
placed his back against a turf wall and accounted for 13 dragoons with
his claymore before being cut down himself.
If these tales were true, these three men alone would have accounted
for more than half of the Hanoverian losses. Nobody counted the Highland
dead, but the battle and the slaughter that followed are generally
reckoned to have claimed well over 1000 lives.
Historians, not to mention descendants of the Jacobite clansmen, are
still debating whether they died in a worthy cause. Mr James Shaw Grant,
a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, argues that the Jacobite
defeat at Culloden was a disaster for the Highlands, and that the only
thing that could have been worse would have been a Jacobite victory.
There is no evidence that the Stuarts were favourably disposed towards
the Highlands, he says. The break-up of the Highland clan system was
government policy in Scotland even before the Union of the Crowns, and
was essentially a Lowland Scottish design.
John Prebble, the author and historian, takes the view that Culloden
was bad for the Highlands in terms of the harsh and vindictive
repression that followed, but that it was just as well the Stuarts did
not return to power. ''They had no particular love for the Highlands. It
was not the Scottish Crown Charles was after, it was the British throne.
And at a time when democracy was being established, the Pretenders still
believed in the Divine Right of Kings.''
Mr Prebble also believes it would have been unfortunate to have had an
''intellectually limited'' young man on the throne at a time when the
industrial revolution was barely 50 years away. ''Culloden was like a
surgical operation that cut the throat of a society that was bound to
succumb to impending changes anyway,'' he says.
Amid all the conflicting passions and romantic nonsense surrounding
the event, Mr Prebble reminds us of an essential truth: ''As an
ex-soldier, I think all battles are bad. I feel sympathy for the
ordinary people on both sides at Culloden who didn't really know what
they were fighting for, and wouldn't get much out of it no matter who
won.''

KEITH BRUCE looks at a clever production about the secret life of
philosopher Michel Foucault
IT'S a heady mix. Pink Floyd's soundtrack for the movie Zabriskie
Point. Goethe's Faust. A Nietzsche poem. A flop Al Pacino movie. Some
Hi-8 video footage. The secret life of a French philosopher. That's
Brainy.
This clever stuff is the creation of performer/director Nick Philippou
of Actors Touring Company and director/designer Stewart Laing. It's the
second production by Laing's TV Productions, a company created to stage
Copi's The Homosexual for the Into The Blue season at Glasgow's Tramway
in 1993 and will be seen as a work-in-progress at the city's Centre for
Contemporary Arts tomorrow and on Saturday.
Laing dismisses suggestions of smartarsery in presenting a devised
performance piece about philosopher Michel Foucault.
''I went to art school, so I was 32 before I heard of him. And my
first experience of him was through a biography. I came to the
philosophy later.'' So it is the seedier side of Michel Foucault that is
the narrative concern of the piece -- an aspect of his existence that
his friends and family have tried to suppress.
Seedy? That would certainly be the mainstream reaction to his social
life in the gay leather bars of San Francisco. Foucault began travelling
to the west coast of the US in the 1970s when he had a teaching post at
Berkeley University. On his first visit he went to Death Valley (the
setting of Zabriskie Point) and dropped LSD, an experience said to have
had a profound effect on his worldview.
Laing and Philippou secured a grant from the Wingate Scholarship Fund
to research the piece and travelled to Paris, where Foucault's former
lover refused to see them, and to California, where they visited Death
Valley, but found West Coast Americans so clean-living in the 1990s that
they couldn't supply the hallucinogenic drugs to allow them replicate
their subject's experience.
Former colleagues at the university were reluctant to talk about
Foucault's private life, claiming it was irrelevant to his scholarship,
but it is an American biography of him -- still unpublished in France --
that first told of it.
''It came as a revelation that the philosopher was out there having a
good time with the rest of the boys,'' notes Laing.
''His private life was as interesting as his actual work. We are not
coming to this from an academic point of view -- we want to give an idea
of what he might really have been about.''
Foucault died of an Aids-related disease in 1984, but even the facts
of death have been shrouded in secrecy by those close to him. His sister
and his lover, Daniel Defert, allegedly had an alternative death
certificate completed and destroyed the original -- yet Defert now runs
the French equivalent of Aids charity the Terence Higgins Trust.
It was another book, a ''fictionalised'' account of Foucault's death
by French writer Herve Guibert that is said to be accurate, which told
France the facts and it is one of the many eclectic sources the
co-directors have used.
Alongside the biographers and philosophers there are fragments of
dialogue from American porn movies, and from the Al Pacino vehicle
Cruisin', a film about a cop who dons the garb of homosexual clubs to
investigate a murder in San Francisco.
''It opened and closed in a fortnight, but there was a big fuss
because the gay community was politically correct at the time. Now it is
a cult thing, very like the Sharon Stone film Basic Instinct is with
lesbians,'' he says.
Brainy has a cast of four -- Philippou, Adrian Howells, Jami Quarell
and Scott Sellers -- and is being presented as a work-in-progress and
invitations have been sent to the funding bodies in the hope that it can
be developed for next year's Mayfest in Glasgow.
Before then Laing has plenty with which to keep himself busy.
Immediately after Brainy he begins work on a Scottish Opera-go-round
small-scale touring production of Puccini's La Boheme, which opens at
the start of September. He is both directing and designing the show, and
it follows his highly-praised design for the full company's Fidelio for
last year's Edinburgh Festival.
After that it is his second production (both direction and design) for
the Citizens' Theatre, following on from an acclaimed reading of
Strindberg's The Father last year. Verga's The She Wolf opens at the
beginning of October.
Laing points out that these back-to-back shows have more than their
director and designer in common. Puccini was writing an opera based on
The She Wolf when he transferred his attentions to the plot of Boheme,
and much of the music was also reused. Maybe you have to be brainy to
spot such coincidences, but Laing would surely deny it.

Q: Let us start off by asking you about your listening campaign. Are
you prepared to take action on complaints that may be put to you about
Tory policies in Scotland?
A: I didn't just ask for complaints. I'm hoping for good positive
suggestions, although I'm willing to listen to complaints as to how we
can improve the government of Scotland. Already we have had some
positive ideas, some of which we will take up. But I'm not going to say
''Yes'' to everybody and I'm not going to answer every problem. But that
doesn't mean that it isn't useful to have a dialogue and to find common
ground.
I recognise that we are at 11% in the polls and therefore I have to
approach this job with a degree of humility. In something of the spirit
in which I try to operate in my own constituency. I never ask people
whether they vote for me. I try to represent the interests of the whole
area. It is impossible to do that to perfection but you can make an
attempt to find common ground.
Q: What kind of areas might these be?
A: I hestitate to give examples because these meetings are private.
For example, one of the things that Campbell Christie has suggested to
me from the STUC is that I should make more use of the Scottish Economic
Council because it brings together people from the different areas of
Scottish life which are important to developing a strategy to make
Scotland competitive and successful. I think that's a very good idea.
There is a whole raft of things which in partnership with local
government that we can achieve. For example, the other day when it was
necessary to look at the powers that we have to look into allegations of
misconduct or wrongdoing in local government it was right and sensible
to invite Cosla to work jointly with the Scottish Office on that.
I'm keen to find ways to give local authorities more freedom and
giving them some of the powers and responsibilities that are exercised
centrally to be exercised locally. And in turn I want them to devolve
power downwards to community councils, tenants associations, school
boards, other organisations so that we can address what is undoubtedly a
widespread and real feeling that people want to have more say over their
own affairs.
Q: Taking stock? Are you taking it any further?
A: Yes. I do have some ideas, although they are not absolutely firm. I
do think the Scottish Grand Committee can play a much more important
role. We are going to have to make some difficult -- in the sense of
difficult for politicians -- decisions. I don't see why the Select
Committee should not have a much more important role. I spent last
weekend reading the Select Committee's report on Scottish Enterprise and
the LECs -- I thought it was an extremely impressive report with a lot
of good ideas.
So we can make more use of the Select Committee system and the actual
roles. These are all things that I am happy to do. I also think that
Cosla could play a much closer part in our policy-making. We had our
first meeting the other day. It was a meeting full of laughter. I
enjoyed it. They enjoyed it. And at the end of the meeting -- the real
test -- Cosla said that we are not due to meet until November, do you
think we could have another meeting before then?
Now that's the sort of relationship that I want with local government.
I know that they are controlled in the main by the Labour Party, but I
think that there is a real chance to find common ground and work
together. I think that local authorities would welcome that and I think
that I can play a role in making that happen. We need a far more
grown-up debate about Scottish issues and I do think that the Scottish
Grand Committee could provide a forum for that and that we could move
away from the sterility of ''Yah-boo, We Wuz Robbed, everything is the
fault of Westminster''.
Q: Could they suggest legislation?
A: I wouldn't be averse to taking legislation through the Grand
Committee.
Q: Might they initiate it?
A: That's certainly something that we could look at. Of course
Westminster is the legislative body and legislation would have to
command a majority, but I am certainly prepared to look at ways in which
we can use the Grand Committee more effectively, look at the procedures
of the Grand Committee to help the government of Scotland. But I am not
going to do anything to undermine our ability to maintain the union or
maintain the outstandingly high levels of prosperity that we now enjoy
in Scotland. Everything is going so well except of course in the Tory
Party, 11% in the polls. Clearly we are getting things wrong and we have
got to try to address people's concerns which go well beyond the normal
currency of political debate.
Q: The Tory 92 Group is proposing to the Chancellor that the Exchequer
Grant should be on a per capita basis for Scotland and Wales. What do
you think about that?
A: I feel that it would be over my dead body. That's what I feel. The
expenditure that we get for Scotland is based on need and if people want
to argue about that expenditure, we'll let them argue whether or not
that it is justified.
To suggest that we should just have a level of expenditure across the
UK regardless of need, regardless of sparcity of population, regardless
of the nature of Scotland is just ridiculous. I think this is not a
proposal that will carry any weight. I am perfectly happy to defend our
expenditure on the basis of -- is it value for money? Is it justified?
I would no more argue for having a set percentage, getting on for a
quarter more per head north of the Border than south of the Border, so
they are actually talking about cutting expenditure by a huge amount.
I'm not going to go along with that under any circumstances. Basis of
need, that is how we should determine public expenditure.
''It's also a cop-out if I may say so. Faced with the difficulty of
finding areas where you can cut public expenditure, if you are an
English MP it's pretty easy to say we'll take it off Scotland and Wales
because it doesn't affect their constituencies. But it certainly affects
mine. We will fight like tigers to argue our corner. That is not to say
that we will not play our part in making reductions in public
expenditure. If there are to be reductions then Scotland, of course,
will take its fair share. But we are not having people arguing that we
should have our block grant provision reduced on account of an arbitrary
basis rather than an assessment of need. It will be defended on the
basis that it is needed and that it is well spent.
This is not something that I regard as in any way negotiable. I have
no doubt that you will think to yourselves that this is a very strong
statement at the beginning of the public expenditure round, as indeed it
is. It is a fundamental principle as far as I am concerned.
Q: Can you tell us about the ''new model Forsyth''? Are you now a
consensus politican now? Your speech to the Tory Party conference in
Glasgow in May was all about ''society''. Something that Margaret
Thatcher said does not exist . . .
A: The views in that speech are no different to those I have always
had. This idea that has been put about by Mr Blair that Conservatives
don't believe in society or community. It's based on a complete travesty
of what Mrs Thatcher said in her speech. She said that there is no such
thing as society. Society consists of individuals all doing their bit
for society. She was making a case for communities, for society being
something that is not Whitehall, but depends on individuals. It was a
gross distortion of what Margaret actually said.
Q: But she was also against consensus, in order, as she said to get
things done. You seem to be offering Scotland consensus in order to get
things done. Have you changed? How much?
A: A bit. My views . . . the principles and ideas remain the same.
Perhaps the way I go about things has changed. The job I've got to do
has changed. The job then was as a Young Turk, trying to goad people
into seeing that we, if we were concerned about poverty, education
standards, health, unemployment, the market mechanisms, and choice and
devolution of power and freeing up people, had a part to play in
delivering that.
To some extent these arguments are now won and it's about delivery.
And also I think that I have probably a greater understanding, having
done a number of jobs in Government about how to get to your
destination. That does not mean that you've forgotten where you are
travelling to.
Q: The appointment of Gerald Warner as your political advisor has
caused some controversy. Is this the old Forsyth coming out?
A: It depends which newspaper you read. He's got his own views. He is
not being employed as a special adviser for his views. I know what my
views are and I don't actually share some of his views on some issues.
I don't need and I don't believe the ministerial team needs somebody
to advise them on policy matters. What I want from Gerald Warner -- he
is a good writer, he understands Scottish history, he understands the
Scottish way of life. I want my ministers to be out and about, talking
to people, finding out what's happening.
It's no good passing legislation if you don't know what's happening on
the ground and you do not have a dialogue going on with the people. I
want to explain, because we have clearly failed, to explain what our
policies are about. We need somebody to help ministers put across in
clear and concise terms what we are all about. That is what his task is.
He is there because he has a sharp pen and from time to time I have been
on the receiving end of it.
I used to think that the Scottish media was against us, but I think we
could do a lot more in putting our message across. We now have a
journalist with the necessary skills to help us do that.
Q: Do you see the differences between Michael Forsyth under Mrs
Thatcher and Michael Forsyth under John Major?
A: I wrote a pamphlet published by the Adam Smith Institute called ''A
Country at Ease With Itself''. It was an attempt to explain why Majorism
was a seamless transition from the Thatcherite agenda. There were still
some tensions in the party at that time and I don't think it played
particularly well. But it stands the test of time. What we are doing is
carrying forward the agenda we began in 1979 and the real compliment and
the real success lies in the extent to which the Labour Party now feels
the need to ape our terminology.
Even now you can see this happening. You can see it in my own
constituency where there is a women-only shortlist. They can't find a
candidate. No doubt their pollsters have told them it's unpopular and
the policy has been ditched today from after the next election . But
where does that leave the candidate? They are moving, but the lesson for
us is to keep moving forward.
Q: But the more Labour come round to these policies the harder it is
surely to produce reasons why people should vote Conservative?
A: If people want Tony Blair's education policies in terms of freedom
of choice and parental responsibility north of the Border then they have
to vote Tory because George Robertson is still busily mouthing the EIS
agenda.
If we can break out from the ridiculous argument of whether we are
going to have a tax-raising Assembly in Scotland and look out into the
world at what is coming. What is coming is a great wave of competition.
We have to be able to make the goods and services that people will want.
We're not going to do that by cutting people's wages or trying to find
ways of producing low value added products. We are going to have to have
a well-educated society. So education has to be a priority.
If I look back to what happened in the eighties when some of us
started scribbling pamphlets for the Adam Smith Institute arguing that
the state did not have to run airlines and so on, this was considered
rather eccentric. People now think it is a rather eccentric idea that
the state should do that.
I would like to think, and I am sure we can create a situation where
people can look back on the 1990s and say that was the decade when
governments realised that it wasn't necessary to limit the spending on
the infrastructure whether on super-highways or roads or bridges or
sewers to what government could afford. It was possible to enter into a
partnership with the private sector with the private sector taking a
risk and doing so at a pace and on a timescale which made us able to
compete.
To give one example which your newspaper has, I think, reported in a
rather unimaginative way, that is the Skye road bridge. The whole
coverage has been about the tolls and how high they are. They are the
same as the ferry and it's a damn sight more convenient to cross by car.
But there was never any possibility of the bridge being built at all if
it had had to compete with other projects in the public spending
programme. It has been built because it was possible to bring in private
capital.
Scotland is well placed in this situation because of the Scottish
Office and the Scottish financial institutions to revolutionise public
spending in this country. If Labour are in favour of doing that too this
is not something where we should say Johnnies Come Lately. We should say
-- let's get together. We can build new jobs and prosperity. It's a very
exciting concept.
The joy is that the Treasury are saying that if there is a risk taken
by the public sector the project doesn't count against public-sector
spending. I think I can put building blocks in place and I can get the
local authorities to work with us on that and I think it could be an
enormous success.
If I were to say I wanted to build a private prison in Scotland
various people would jump up and say -- he wants to privatise the
prisons. But we could have prison officers employed by the state in the
usual way. From experience in England we found a privately built prison
cost half as much and was built twice as quickly than in the old way.
When you talk to prison officers they say they are easier to run and
more cost-effective. That is the way forward.
Q: Switching to specific projects in the public eye, how confident are
you about the future of the West Highland line and the work of the Torry
research centre?
A: On issues like this we will fight our corner and we will lose on
some and opprobrium will be heaped upon us. But I am not going to fight
only on the basis that I think we can win. There is a case to be made.
Both these matters were pretty advanced when I arrived and Ian Lang
fought valiantly on both of them.
On the Fort William service I support privatisation as a way to
improve services not as a way of diminishing services. It seems to me
quite wrong that an important service like Fort William should be lost.
We have lobbied hard and it does seem to me there is way forward which
is in the interest of the taxpayer and will maintain a service. I can't
direct the Franchise Director to do that but we have put some arguments
to him and he did seem to be very responsive and I hope it will be
possible to maintain a service. I don't know that it will but we have
pulled out all the stops to try and keep a service.
On Torry the research consortium in Aberdeen conducted a study and it
was agreed that Torry could not continue as an entity. What I would like
to do is to try and make a case for at least some of the research work
to remain in Scotland.
Q: You must know that many people in Scotland, despite the listening
approach you have adopted, are asking if the leopard can change his
spots. What have you to say about that?
A: Is it possible the Scottish media may just have got me wrong? If I
am such an enfant terrible why is it that I can hang on in three General
Elections in Stirling? I like to think it is because my constituents
take me as I am for they know me better than the people of Scotland. I
have to communicate with the people of Scotland through the Scottish
media. OK I've done and said things which have upset people from time to
time. But the job of a back bencher who campaigns for changes in the way
people think is quite different from the job of Secretary of State. That
involves speaking for Scotland and is more akin to the job of a
constituency Member of Parliament. There are wider responsibilities
which arise from the nature of the office and I've tried to embark on
this office with that kind of approach.

Artwork made from following instructions gives a communal touch to a
Glasgow exhibition, as CLARE HENRY discovers
DO IT at Glasgow CCA is a new sort of remote-control show which does
away with the presence of the artist. It questions the concept of art as
something unique, original, and handmade. Mrs Thatcher would like it;
it's cost-effective, didactic, and disciplined. It's also simple,
unpretentious -- but not as dull as you might think.
The artworks here are made from following instructions. Twelve
participating artists sat at home in France, Germany, or the US and
wrote down how each piece should be made. One of the strengths of the
show is that these instructions are helpfully written beside each piece.
The instructions, however, are interpreted by people on the spot.
The leeway this gives provides the interest. Boltanski asked for
photos of a class of nearby school kids, obviously different in each
venue. Here kids from Garnethill pose delightfully, and get the photos
at the end of the show. A nice touch.
Bertrand Lavier's French text is more open to misinterpretation. At a
previous venue in Austria ''a crate for wages'' produced a metal safe.
Here John Clark and Simon Hopkins have devised a more aesthetically
intelligent work from container wrapping and concrete.
Local Glasgow involvement means that the acknowledgements list in the
foyer is no token gesture, but really important.
It tells us Dr Leonora Coll was the ''person born before 1961'' chosen
to follow Fabrice Hybert's directions. ''Draw a 5cm cube in perspective
showing each angle. Choosing one of the angles, draw another cube with
different vanishing points. Repeat with maximum number of angles for at
least one and a half hours.'' Dr Coll did a good job.
Less inspired was the person who filled Paul Gette's wooden box with
soil when he had specified sand, pebbles, dead leaves, or volcanic ash.
True -- there's not many vocanoes near Sauchiehall Street.
These instructions can sound like a script, musical score, or recipe.
Rirkrit Tiravanija carried this to its logical conclusion and asked a
chef to cook a spicy concoction of onion, chillis, fresh ginger, garlic,
and cumin at 2pm each day. You consume it at your own risk! Some pieces
are too easy, obvious or pointless.
Alison Knowles asked for a display of red objects: socks, umbrella,
KitKat and so on. So what? Felix Torres wanted a pile of sweets --
again. Mike Kelly's tape records a tape recorder recording.
Several folk homed in on the ubiquitous cube or square with mixed
results. Ilya Kabakov's metaphore for the unattainable is, together with
Maria Eichhorn's ''Make a ring and loose it in the street'' the only
poignant message here.
But Jean Jacques Rullier's notion of visual Chinese whispers is worth
a visit in itself, for it says much about looking and seeing. Fifty folk
copied a diagramatic drawing, the last picture serving as a model for
the next. What starts out as a man and industrial hose soon becomes a
woman, a finger, a train, and eventually an abstract pattern. It's
fascinating how people search for numbers, letters and human attributes
like eyes in even the most amorphous sketch.
DO IT is the brain child of Swiss curator, Hans Obrist, who while
saving air fares, highlights the network of co-operation in an art world
stricken with financial problems. It also makes the creation of art a
less solitary, more communual activity. This is one of the more
interesting shows at CCA in a long time.

Music
OVER recent years the authentic movement has flourished at the hands
of such masters as Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Christopher Hogwood. In
Vienna, Eduard Melkus has become a name familiar to authenticists, so
much so that he is now dubbed the Dean of Baroque violinists. In last
night's recital, a collection of sonatas from Handel and Corelli
confirmed his status at the forefront of the European scene.
Having opted for authentic performance techniques, any soloist of
baroque music must then agonise over the question of ornamentation,
which can make or break a recital. Melkus took time to explain the
differences in ornamentation from one sonata to the next, suggesting
that most of his diversions from the original scores were valid.
Two Opus 5 sonatas by Corelli provided obvious contrasts in
ornamentation techniques. The first, in A major, was arranged by
Geminiani and the second, in E major, by Dubourg. Geminiani opted for
the graceful rococo style, unobtrusive and serving to shape the melodic
lines, while Dubourg disguised Corelli's beautifully sculpted phrases in
ostentatious embellishments.
Melkus adapted well to both genres, clean and sensitive for Geminiani
and impressive in Dubourg's busiest passages. Jean Barr's harpsichord
accompaniments added much buoyancy throughout, securing supporting
harmonies with a gracious touch.
A grey area surrounds the authenticity of Handel's Opus 1 sonatas,
although to date, no alternative attribution has been accepted. The E
major sonata fell easily under the fingers of Melkus, aided in the slow
movements by a wonderfully supple bowing arm. A deeply musical sense of
phrasing allowed for just enough give and take, particularly effective
in the penultimate Largo of the F major sonata which brought the recital
to a close.

<HEADLINE>Dental patients to get #180,000 in compensation</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977191135</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A DENTIST who ''wilfully damaged patient's teeth on a massive scale''
as he carried out unnecessary work was yesterday ordered to pay more
than #180,000 in damages.
The High Court test case judgment could now open the floodgates for
payouts of up to #1.5m for another 64 patients of Barry Garrett.
The court in Leeds heard how Garrett, who practised at Driffield,
Humberside, left patients with psychological problems and needing
extensive repairs to teeth.
Garrett was struck off the dental registry after complaints about
overtreatment, but reinstated two years later.
The judge, Mr Justice Dyson, said yesterday: ''After hearing the
appalling catalogue of events, some may be surprised that the public
were protected from Mr Garrett for only two years.''
The judge described Garrett as a disgrace to his profession.
Eight patients were awarded more than #184,000 in total for general
damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenities, aggravated damages,
psychological damage, and special damages.
Garrett's legal team said after the case that they would be
considering an appeal.
His solicitor, Mr Ralph Shipway, said he did not know where the
dentist was or if he was still practising.
Mr Nigel Walsh, solicitor for the patients, criticised dental chiefs
for reinstating the dentist.
''I don't know if he is still practising since he was reinstated in
1991. I hope he's not practising for the sake of other people.''
Mr Walsh said Garrett would not pay one penny of the estimated #1.5m
final bill for all 72 plaintiffs -- including the eight in court.
Garret's professional insurers would pay the compensation.
One patient, artist Jane Appleton, 26, started having treatment at
Garrett's surgery when she was 15 and was a patient for four years.
She underwent 25 sessions, during which he treated 13 teeth. She had
18 pins, 10 crowns, and two root canal treatments.
At times she would be in the chair for three hours.
The judge said all the work on the patients was unnecessary and badly
done.
''He took advantage of their ages -- most were young -- and abused his
position and calling. He wilfully damaged patient's teeth on a massive
scale.''
The judge added: ''I am driven to conclude that the motive was
profit.''
Dental experts will now come together to discuss payments out of court
to the 64 other patients.

<HEADLINE>BT defends #111-a-second profit. Labour demands cuts in cost of line rentals</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977191137</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom was under fire again last night after new figures
showed the telephone company was making profits of #111 per second.
Labour called for cuts in line rentals and the National Consumer
Council said BT should cut the cost of local calls.
However, the company defended its earnings, saying call costs were
falling and profits matched its investment.
BT made a pre-tax profit of #874m in the three months to the end of
June, up 11.9% on the same period last year, the company's latest
results revealed.
The figures came a day after telephone industry regulator, the Office
of Telecommunications (Oftel), unveiled plans to allow BT to raise line
rentals by as much as it wants.
Shadow consumer spokesman Nigel Griffiths said people would be asking
why BT needed to pocket such huge profits.
''This shows how out of touch the regulator is,'' said Mr Griffiths.
''There is a powerful case for bringing line rental charges down.
''BT and the regulator keep banging on about how the cost of calls is
falling but, in the most cases, those cuts are benefiting businesses and
the rich who make lots of long-distance and international calls.
''Many people in Britain still do not have access to a telephone
simply because the line rent is too high,'' Mr Griffiths added.
NCC director Ruth Evans said: ''These figures yet again prove that BT
is doing very well and could easily afford to pass on some of these
profits to its domestic customers.
''This strengthens our argument that customers deserve to see further
reductions in their bills. We want to see the cost of local calls
slashed.''
However, a BT spokesman said the cost of national calls had fallen 64%
in the 10 years since privatisation and the cost of local calls had
dropped 34%.
''Our profit figure is just about the same as our investment figure,''
he said. ''We are a big company and these figures are big. But the rates
of return are by no means abnormal.''
BT profits shot up from the #781m it made in the three months to June
last year partly because of sharply-reduced redundancy costs.
During the three months to June this year, 800 people left the group
and the redundancy bill came to #22m. In June last year, the bill for
job losses was #54m.
The company has already said it will not simply increase rents as a
result of Oftel's proposals for lifting a cap which prevents BT from
increasing line rents by more than 2% above inflation.
Officials said the change would allow the company to be more flexible
and design bills more suited to individual needs.
Oftel chief Don Cruickshank believes his decision to lift the cap will
increase competition in the industry. He is also confident that pressure
from Mercury and cable companies will force BT to keep a tight rein on
its line-rental charges.
However, consumer groups say lifting the cap is risky.
A BT spokesman said: ''What really matters is the size of the overall
bill and that has been tumbling and will continue to fall even if the
Oftel proposals are carried through.
''According to Oftel, charges to the one in five customers who make
little use of the phone will be protected.
''Our price cuts benefit customers across the board. Our charge of
just 1p per minute for local calls at weekends is clearly aimed at
residential customers. And 70% of customers are now connected for just
#9.99 or free of charge.''

<HEADLINE>Scott Monument to close for at least 18 months</HEADLINE>

Vertigo permitting, it used to be a challenge to climb the 287 steps.
Now they are out of bounds. Christopher Reekie finds out what visitors
think
TOURISTS basked in the sunshine near the Scott Monument in Edinburgh
yesterday -- unable to approach it, let alone ascend its 287 steps to
admire the view from on high.
A hoarding surrounded the monument at ground level and passers-by in
Princes Street walked under a canopy over the pavement.
Further up, there was a ''collar'' of scaffolding to prevent a
recurrence of the falling stonework which has caused anxiety about the
Gothic steeple's future.
In the vault beneath the 200ft sandstone structure, the marble statue
of Sir Walter Scott sat serenely.
The discovery that so prominent a landmark is off limits has dismayed
visitors to the capital.
What did they think of the idea, being floated within Edinburgh
District Council but not yet official or considered by the political
groups, that the Government should take over the ownership of the
monument for a nominal #1 and carry out the #2m repairs?
''It sounds good. That would be nice,'' said Mr Earl Smith, 42, from
southern Illinois in the United States, who is familiar with Scotland
because he served with the US Navy at Holy Loch and met his wife,
Isabel, who is from Port Glasgow.
Mrs Smith, accompanied by their five children, agreed that the
monument should be repaired and opened.
Former librarian Robert Brasher, 74, and his wife, Marilyn, from Long
Beach, California, were surprised to find the monument was closed off.
''My first introduction to books was reading the classics, like the
Waverley Novels,'' said Mr Brasher.
Robert and Margaret Wilson, originally from Glasgow but now living in
Whitburn, West Lothian, said the Government should provide the money for
repairs and refurbishment.
Mr Wilson, who has retired from British Leyland, said: ''It is a work
of art and is worth as much support as some of the things the Government
is putting millions into.''
The Scott Monument attracted between 70,000 and 80,000 visitors a year
at #1 for admission before it was closed at the beginning of this year.
A spokeswoman for Edinburgh District Council said it could not reopen
for at least 18 months and added: ''It is closed indefinitely.''
It was estimated that repairs to the stonework would take just over a
year, with periods of eights weeks before and after to erect and
dismantle scaffolding which would sheath the monument.
But this depended on money being available and the council had none
for this purpose, she said.
A spokesman for Historic Scotland declined to comment and said the
council had not made a formal approach.
It is understood that council representatives have asked informally
about the possibility of Historic Scotland taking over the monument.
A joint approach to the Lottery Heritage Fund for financial support
for repairs has been made by the council and Historic Scotland.
The Conservative group on the district council has not discussed the
matter recently, but Councillor Mrs Moira Knox, its recreation
spokeswoman, personally supported the idea of Historic Scotland becoming
responsible.
''It is such a beautiful monument and such a prominent site, it is a
tragedy what is going on,'' Mrs Knox said.

A REVENGE attack by a would-be poacher or poachers is the likely cause
of the poisoning of hundreds of prime salmon which were yesterday found
floating dead on a top-rated fishing river in the Eastern Highlands, a
river superintendent claimed last night.
Mr Charles Menzies said 1000 adult salmon and grilse on the River
Carron in Ross-shire had been affected, as well as tens of thousands of
juvenile salmon, ranging from this year's fry to parr and smolts of up
to four years old. It could cost the local economy millions of pounds.
''This was undoubtedly a revenge attack by a would-be poacher or
poachers whose efforts have been thwarted by the vigilance of our water
bailiffs,'' he said.
A two-mile stretch of the river, on the 18,000-acre Glen Calvie
estate, has apparently been hit by the poachers who are understood to
have used cyanide to poison the fish.
Mr Peter Fowler, the estate owner, has offered a four-figure reward
for information leading to the conviction of those responsible.
Northern Constabulary has launched an investigation into the incident
and says inquiries are continuing although no-one has been arrested.
The poachers targeted the Falls Pool, a popular stretch of the
fast-flowing salmon-rich 24-mile long river, which rises in the
Ross-shire mountains and flows into the Kyle of Sutherland, near Bonar
Bridge.
The word ''think'' was chalked in block capitals on a sheer riverside
rock-face, close to the affected pool.
By last night, Mr Menzies and his assistants had recovered more than
900 of the dead fish -- some weighing more than 20lbs -- from the river.
It is understood that arrangements were being made to bury the salmon,
which are now not fit for human consumption.
Mr Menzies said: ''This is a tragedy for the river which will
literally take millions of pounds out of the economy of this remote part
of the Highlands for years to come.''
He believed that up to 500 of the dead salmon were females which each
would have been carrying about 10,000 eggs.
The river superintendent predicted that it could take 30 years for the
eco-system of the affected part of the river to recover because of the
devastation caused in losing generations of salmon in one fell swoop.
The river has recently been the scene of an on-going dispute between
organised poaching gangs and police and water bailiffs.
It is believed that those responsible for the poisoning might have
used Cymag, a brand-name which is sometimes used for gassing rabbits and
foxes.
It acts by removing dissolved oxygen from the water, which the fish
need to pass through their gills to breathe.
Farmers and gamekeepers have to sign a register to obtain the strictly
controlled poison, which releases lethal hydrogen cyanide gas when it
comes into contact with moisture.
Yesterday, a well-known Highland angler, who declined to be named,
said poachers usually put a small quantity of the poison in a nylon
stocking into the water, and wait for the fish to surface.
He added: ''Only amateurs, or those seeking revenge against the proper
authorities, would throw a whole tinful into the water, as seems to have
have happened here.''
Last night, police warned the public to treat ''with suspicion'' any
freshwater fish offered for sale from anyone other than a recognised
source.
Anyone with information on the poisoning can contact a confidential
hotline on 01863 766222.

SCOTRAIL yesterday confirmed it was proposing to run the Fort William
sleeper through the winter months by combining it with the Inverness and
Aberdeen services if the rail fanchise director agreed to the plan.
As The Herald revealed yesterday, the proposal is for two sleepers to
travel to and from Scotland six nights a week. One would serve Edinburgh
and Glasgow while the other would stop at Edinburgh where the six
Aberdeen cars would join up with or separate from the five for Inverness
and one for Fort William. On Fridays and Sundays, there would be two
Fort William cars to cater for skiers travelling to Aonach Mor and
Glencoe.
This proposal would make significant savings on the #2.6m it costs to
run the Fort William service but ScotRail would not say how much. A
spokeswoman said yesterday: ''I can't tell you that but the savings
would be substantial. Whether they would be sufficient to persuade the
franchise director Roger Salmon to include the service in the passenger
service requirement remains to be seen. If he isn't persuaded, we will
have to go back and look at it again but this is certainly our preferred
option.''
She said there was still a lot of work to be done on timings but
ScotRail was proceeding on the basis that the service would come into
operation on September 23 and bookings would be taken from August 1.
The convener of Highland Regional Council, Mr Duncan McPherson, who
has been leading the campaign to save the sleeper since last December,
winning a court order preventing its withdrawal before full public
consultation, reported the breakthrough to a meeting of community groups
in Spean Bridge on Tuesday night.
''As the result of almost daily discussions on this important issue,
we appear to be making real progress. At the same time, we are striving
to ensure the sleeper service has a future within a privatised rail
network. Our goal is to persuade the franchise director to include the
service in the PSR. The PSR is the minimum level of service to be
provided by the franchisee throughout the seven-year life of the
franchise.
''It is on this wider issue that Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
has become involved in talks with Mr Salmon as well as the Transport
Secretary, Sir George Young. The Scottish Secretary's support is crucial
and is very welcome.''
Lochaber councillor Euan Harper, a former train driver in Fort
William, was also happy to endorse the proposal but wondered by ScotRail
had not proposed it before.
Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy said: ''This certainly
confirms all the private indications which have been given to me about
the significant change of heart taking place at the centre of our rail
and political decision-making arenas.''
Mr Kennedy thought the ScotRail proposals now afforded Mr Salmon
sufficient room for manoeuvre to include the service in the PSR. A
spokesman for the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising told The Herald
that a decision would be announced ''in the late summer''.

A SCIENTIST at Edinburgh's Napier University has been awarded a
#130,000 grant to research the risk to workmen of long-term exposure to
fibres used in the manufacturing and construction industry.
Dr Kenneth Donaldson, of the biological sciences department, will
examine the risk to factory and construction workers in a three-year
study funded by the Health and Safety Executive.
The dangers from asbestos fibres, which cause the lung cancer
mesothelioma, have already been highlighted. The fibres were used widely
in the construction industry in the 1960s and 1970s until their
potential dangers led to a ban.
Deaths caused by exposure to the asbestos fibres are expected to claim
3000 lives by the year 2020. However, while the fibres have been banned,
dust from the material remains a potential hazard to workmen, who may be
involved in renovating or stripping asbestos from buildings constructed
before the ban.
New materials also release fibres and their potential for harm has yet
to be studied.
A spokesman for the Union of Construction, Allied Trades, and
Technicians said: ''I am particularly pleased to hear that kind of
funding is being put into the project. We have been concerned for many
years that research into occupation health hazards in construction has
been underfunded.''

A WOMAN who was locked in a house, raped, and tortured, finally
strangled her tormentor and set fire to his body, a court heard
yesterday.
Mary Chalmers, 37, had come to believe that 65-year-old John McKenna,
was the devil.
During her murder trial at Glasgow High Court yesterday, she changed
her plea to guilty to a reduced charge of culpable homicide.
She admitted killing McKenna in his home at Glenacre Terrace,
Castlemilk, Glasgow, by strangling him and setting fire to his clothing.
Mr Paul Cullen, prosecuting, said he was accepting the plea to the
reduced charge because a post-mortem examination had revealed McKenna's
coronary artery was reduced to a pinhole and he could have dropped dead
at any time.
Mr Cullen said that, during her judicial examination, Chalmers had
told the sheriff: ''It was him or me.''
Mr Edgar Prais, QC, defending, yesterday told the court of Chalmers's
background. She had lived in women's refuges and was beaten up by every
man she ever stayed with.
She was happy when McKenna offered her a place to stay but stipulated
there was to be no sex involved. This was agreed. However, in the 10 to
12 days leading up to McKenna's death, he subjected her to physical
violence and sexual assault.
Mr Prais told the court how McKenna burned her with cigarettes on the
leg, kept her locked in the house, and hid the telephone.
He raped and sodomised her and, the night before he died, he raped her
again. Mr Prais said McKenna was very drunk and tried to choke her.
The next day, he woke as she tried to find the key to escape. When he
threatened her, she picked up a length of string and put it around his
neck. He fell but she didn't think he was dead.
Mr Prais said that in her panic Chalmers set fire to the back of
McKenna's T-shirt, hoping he would try to put it out, giving her time to
escape. She then found the key and made to leave.
Mr Prais said: ''McKenna started the ball rolling and paid an
enormously high price for it. So did she. But it was his conduct which
led her to do what she did.''
He revealed that, even after she tried to douse the flames with a damp
towel and salt, Chalmers could not accept McKenna was dead and she tried
to drag him into the bedroom to get him to bed.
During the trial, her sister Josephine, 40, revealed how Chalmers
frequently saw the devil.
Mr Prais said yesterday that Chalmers was someone who believed in the
role of the devil and told how her prison cell was exorcised by a
priest.
A psychiatrist had also pointed out in a report that Chalmers had
unusual beliefs and said she may have seen McKenna as the devil in
disguise.
Judge Lord Milligan will sentence Chalmers at the High Court in
Edinburgh today.

ONE of the largest paintings privately commissioned in Scotland in
recent years was unveiled at Glasgow Airport yesterday as part of the
airport owners' programme to instal art in public places.
The Golden City,by internationally acclaimed ''New Glasgow Boy''
Steven Campbell,measures 30ft by 8ft and will be an arresting sight for
international travellers as they pass through the security and
immigration area.
Painting the canvas over six months at his studio cum barn in
Stirlingshire was tinged with sadness for Campbell as his father died of
cancer while he was working on it.
His mother, Mettie, saw it for the first time at the unveiling
yesterday and said: ''Steven said to me: 'Mum, there's so much of my
emotion in it. My dad's in it.' And it is beautiful. The more you look
at it, the more you see.''
Airport managing director Mr Donal Dowds said the painting allowed
Glasgow people to identify with the city. He declined to say how much it
cost, saying that although it was a considerable sum, it represented
value for money.
The Herald's art critic Clare Henry writes: I had seen Campbell's huge
canvas in progress and liked what I saw but the finished mural unveiled
today looks stunning.
He told me: ''It shows Glasgow in a vast, glorious, romantic, golden
glow bordered by nature. It's the view as you approach Glasgow from my
home in Kippen.''
Campbell had no problems with the surrounding countryside, nor with
Clydeside where he originally worked in the shipyards, but painting the
city was not easy. Obviously an exact topographical representation was
not his plan. However, his solution is perfect as a compositional
device.
It shows Glasgow as though on a map or parchment, held aloft by a
flock of midsummer swallows, surrounded by a countryside teeming with
animals, butterflies, and birds which are painted with terrific realism
and style.
It is very much an idealised view of the Dear Green Place, as though a
fairytale legend in a children's story book is spread out before you,
complete with a magic wand which touches the top of Trinity Tower with
gold dust.
Campbell's three children feature in the painting, along with a
signpost to Glasgow and to Fintry. He said: ''I love Glasgow. The
painting is celebratory: an idealised and idyllic Dear Green Place but
one that I hope will please travellers. I want people to be uplifted.''

EXCLUSIVE
A THIEF has robbed Scotland's most successful international sportsman
of the gun which he hoped would take him to a record seventh
Commonwealth Games.
Alister Allan, whose medal tally includes two World Championship
golds, Olympic silver and bronze, and nine Commonwealth Games medals,
including three golds, had more than #6000 worth of equipment, including
a custom-built shotgun, stolen from the boot of his car.
Allan, of Kinnesswood, in Fife, is offering #500 for the return of the
Italian-made Prazzi over-and-under 12-bore, which cost more than #3000,
and the rest of his gear which was in a Barcelona Olympic team bag.
Allan took his dog, Harvey, for a walk on the shores of Loch Leven on
Saturday evening. ''When I returned seven minutes later, the car boot
had been broken into and all my equipment stolen,'' he said.
''I don't think I had been targeted. The only other vehicle in the car
park had also been broken into. I am sickened that the gun should have
fallen into the wrong type of hands. It will probably be sold for a
couple of hundred pounds and sawn off.
''The gun, which was in a hard case, was a one-off. I had used it only
twice, having just had it returned to me after having been customised.''
Allan won all of his medals in the small-bore rifle event, in which he
also holds the world record, but decided to change disciplines and
concentrate on shotgun for the next Commonwealth Games, in Kuala Lumpur.
''It had taken me two years to find the gun which suited me best and
get it customised. The car insurance is limited to #1000 so I doubt
whether I can replace it. I can barely afford the #500 reward I am
offering. It has really upset me. It looks as though my hopes of a
seventh Commonwealth Games are out the window.''
Also removed from his Mazda 626 were two shooting jackets, two
shooting vests, special #100 glasses, a tool kit for his guns, and
trigger assemblies.

A YOUNG man knifed to death by a schizophrenic hostel dweller was the
victim of a series of blunders by the police, social services, health
chiefs and the voluntary group for whom he worked, a damning report
showed yesterday.
Would-be film-maker Jonathan Newby, 22, was left in sole charge of the
hostel for the mentally ill, run by the Oxford Cyrenians, when he was
stabbed by John Rous, 49.
The stabbing came less than 50 minutes after police ignored threats
from Rous warning that he was set to kill someone, according to the
highly critical report of an inquiry into Mr Newby's death.
Rous was last year convicted of manslaughter and sent to the top
security hospital at Broadmoor.
Mr Newby, a graduate, had put off his studies for a Master of Arts
because he wanted to ''make his contribution'' to society, but he was
let down by a range of agencies and a faulty system which cost him his
life, the report concluded.
The inquiry team, led by Ms Nicola Davies, QC, found:
* The Cyrenians were ill-equipped to deal with the severely mentally
ill, its staff were untrained, and its managers incompetent. Its
decision to leave Mr Newby alone and in charge of the hostel in what had
already been a difficult week was condemned as ''reprehensible''.
* The police were criticised after a civilian telephone operator hung
up when Rous rang threatening to take out Mr Newby's liver and warned
they were about to have a ''dead corpse'' on their hands. The control
room was not informed and no officers were dispatched.
* Health and social services were blamed for failing to invest in
psychiatric care for the homeless during the seventies and eighties,
leaving voluntary groups like the Oxford Cyrenians to fill the gap. Lack
of joint planning between health and social services also meant there
was no expertise of mental health care in the community.
* Social services were also accused of laxity and incompetence over
registration and inspection procedures for new homes.
At a news conference yesterday, Ms Davies said there were lessons to
be learned at a national level as well as locally from Mr Newby's death
on October 9, 1993.
She said she was to meet Health Minister John Bowis to outline the
needs for training of all staff and national standards of care.
She expected to see him within the next four weeks following repeated
requests from her for a meeting. She will also see the Environment
Secretary to discuss the resource implications.
Ms Davies warned she would not be ''fobbed off'' by Ministers and
claimed the report would not be allowed to sit in the back of a
cupboard.
Labour said the Newby inquiry indicated that proper community care
provision for the seriously mentally ill needed much more than just the
sticking plaster approach of the current Mental Health Bill.
Mr David Hinchliffe, Labour's community care spokesman, said the
Government had, during recent consideration of the Bill, resisted
opposition amendments that would have addressed a number of failings
identified by the inquiry.
He said the Government had to take the recommendations of the inquiry
on board during the report stage of the Bill in October and during the
current review of the 1984 Registered Homes Act.
Refusal to hand over #2.50 was the trigger
VOLUNTARY worker Jonathan Newby's refusal to hand over #2.50 to John
Rous is believed to have been the trigger for the schizophrenic to turn
killer. However, an earlier chain of events had already put Rous in a
dangerous state.
In the days leading up to killing, he had become increasingly upset by
a woman resident in Jacqui Porter House who was behaving in a disturbed
way.
Rous was without vital support on October 9 -- the day of the killing.
He spent it drinking and it is believed he took drugs. He was given an
injection at 5pm, the time Mr Newby came on duty. At 7.30pm, Rous asked
Mr Newby for money. What happened next is described in Mr Newby's log.
''John also asked me for an IOU tonight and became extremely
threatening when I refused to give it to him. He called 999 and told the
police he was going to kill me. He also told me to my face he would cut
my throat if I didn't give him the money.
''He went into his room to get a knife so I locked my office and he
proceeded to kick the door in but at this point I was more concerned for
my own safety and told him I would give him an IOU if he'd sign a piece
of paper explaining his reasons for needing it.
''He complied with this and said he was going to the night shelter
tonight. His behaviour was extremely intimidating and completely out of
order.''
Having received the money, Rous went to a pub, where he drank one and
a half pints of lager. Rous said it was there he decided to kill
someone. He returned to Jacqui Porter House with a kitchen knife and
stabbed Mr Newby in the chest.
HEALTH unions are still refusing to settle over pay even where full 3%
''no strings'' offers are available, according to the largest union
involved, Unison, which is leading the campaign to retain national
bargaining in the NHS.
The NHS pay dispute moves into a new phase this weekend with a march
and rally through central London in protest at the imposition of local
pay before industrial action balloting gets under way from Monday.
NHS managers claim that 429 out of the 500 NHS trusts have made offers
based on the 1% national increase topped up with local payments, and
that some 360 of them totalled 3% or more.
Unison concedes almost all trusts have made offers, but that only 150
meet the 3% ''no strings'' criteria, thereby making it most unlikely
that the ''critical mass'' of 300 demanded by the non-TUC Royal College
of Nursing as the price for settlement will be reached.
In Scotland, senior regional officer Jim Devine said all 47 trusts had
made offers, ranging upwards from 1% by the Victoria Infirmary in
Glasgow, but none matched their demand of 3% all round without strings.
''Some are now offering 4% from July, which is more or less equivalent
to 3% for the year with strings,'' he said. ''Three per cent for the
average nurse is #360. One of the strings is converting public holidays
-- for which they get paid extra -- to ordinary leave. They would lose
up to #390 that way. Working through public holidays is an important
component in the wages of low-paid workers.''
Unison's head of health, Mr Bob Abberley, maintained that there had
been no local settlements to date and that, although 28 trusts south of
the Border had imposed increases, the vast bulk refused to do so for
fear of souring relations with local officials.
He said at the start of a tour of Glasgow, Glenrothes, and Aberdeen
that he he was confident of a resounding positive answer to both
questions on the ballot -- for industrial action short of a strike, and
for strike action itself (they have now by law to be posed separately).
''In that event, we will give the statutory seven days' notice but we
will not give advance notice of what particular day we will strike,'' he
said.
However, they would honour the TUC code by conferring with management
to ensure that there was emergency cover.
''I can't say patient care won't be affected but I can say that we
won't put patients at risk,'' he said. ''A one-day strike will be in
effect like a bank holiday. In fact, I am told by members who have been
involved in action in the past that the level of emergency cover we
provide sometimes exceeds the level of staffing provided in the normal
course of events.''
On Saturday, Unison and 11 other health unions and organisations --
although not the RCN or the Royal College of Midwives which has settled
separately after achieving an additional productivity pay deal -- are
due to stage a national demonstration of their support for fair pay for
all 900,000 NHS staff and against the move towards local pay.
A Scottish march and rally is planned for August 19 in Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth's Stirling constituency.
* The highest earners among Britain's hospital consultants are to be
made publicly identifiable in a shake-up of their merit awards system.
Employers are to have a say in who gets the awards and the cash at the
lower end of the award scale -- amounting to about half the total -- is
to be more widely distributed.
The move was agreed after negotiations between Health Ministers and
the British Medical Association, following a review led by Dr Robert
Kendell, Chief Medical Officer for Scotland.
Distinction awards are on top of consultants' annual salaries, which
range from #40,620 to #52,440, and were introduced as an incentive for
doctors to give up lucrative private work to join the NHS.
Under the present system, there are four bands of awards -- C, B, A
and A-plus -- ranging in size from #10,490 to #49,820.

BANK manager Jim Harper appeared to be a pillar of society but behind
the respectable facade he hid two guilty secrets.
Unknown to his family and customers at his bank, the father of three
was involved in a gay relationship and also was an embezzler who
pocketed #63,786 from a client's account.
Harper, 40, yesterday admitted at Aberdeen Sheriff Court transferring
cash from a woman pensioner's account into his own.
It happened while he was manager of the Clydesdale Bank in Greenfern
Place, Mastrick, Aberdeen, between April 1992 and June 1993.
Depute fiscal Derek Buchanan accepted Harper's not guilty pleas to
three other charges involving a further #85,761.
No details were given in court of the background to the offence
committed by Harper, now living in a flat in The Spital, Aberdeen.
Harper was suspended from his post in April last year. Throughout his
questioning by fraud squad detectives, he denied taking any money from
customers.
However, police remained convinced of his guilt but were never able to
establish where the missing money had gone.
They considered a number of motives, including the possibility that
Harper was being blackmailed over his gay activities.
At the time of his suspension, Harper already was off sick, apparently
having suffered a severe beating. Police investigated a homosexual link
and another man was at one point charged with attempted murder.
However, in the absence of co-operation from Harper, the procurator
fiscal dropped the charge.
Mrs Elizabeth Harper has remained at the couple's home in Bonnymuir
Place, Aberdeen, with the children.
The youngest child is severely handicapped and is a pupil at the
city's Raeden Centre which caters for special needs. At the time of the
offence, Harper was chairman of the Friends of the Raeden Centre, the
fund-raising arm of the school.
The charity's treasurer, Mr Ian Stephen,
said:''There was never any suggestion that any of the bank's money
found its way to the charity.''
Harper said yesterday: ''I am suffering from epilepsy and just want to
be left alone. I have three young children and I do not want them
dragged into this.''
A spokesman for the Clydesdale Bank said he could not comment on how a
bank manager made off with more than #60,000. He said procedures at all
of the company's branches had been tightened up in the light of the
case.
Harper was ordered to appear in court again on August 23 following
social inquiry and community service reports.

A THREE-YEAR-OLD boy and his grandfather were drowned on the east
coast of the Mull of Kintyre last night after their dinghy capsized.
The boy's mother and six-year-old sister swam to safety and raised the
alarm after the 10ft vessel capsized near Carradale just after 7pm.
A rescue operation involving a helicopter from HMS Gannet at
Prestwick, local fishing vessels, and coastguard officials was
immediately launched.
Strathclyde Police said the body of the grandfather, a semi-retired
businessman from Edinburgh, was recovered at 8.10pm. His grandson's body
was recovered 15 minutes later.
His daughter and granddaughter were treated for slight hypothermia in
hospital in Campbeltown.
The family, who are all from Edinburgh, were understood to have spent
the day at the beach at Carradale Bay and were making their way back to
the harbour at Carradale, around Carradale Point, when the dinghy
capsized 200 yards from the shore.
The grandfather is understood to have had a holiday home at Carradale
for about 18 years.
Police have not disclosed the name of the family.

A #3M plan has been drawn up to save Britain's last fully operational
wooden pier on the Clyde.
The ferry terminal at Dunoon could eventually be lost, say community
leaders, unless urgent action is taken. Repairs costing #1m are already
being carried out following severe damage to the Victorian pier during
storms earlier this year and the redevelopment plan would see a
protective breakwater, providing ''safe haven'' for yachts, and new
tourist facilities.
The scheme has been drawn up by Dunoon Community Council's vice
chairman, Mr Alister MacAlister, who said an application could soon be
made to the National Lottery Millenium Fund for the pier refurbishment
programme. Facilities for up to 40 boats and a Victorian heritage centre
would form the major part of the project.
Mr Alister MacAlister said: ''Unless urgent action is taken, this pier
will eventually get past the point where maintenance will cost so much
that it will be prohibitive.''

TOP British grandmaster Nigel Short was beaten by Judit Polgar in the
fourth round of the Scottish Co-op Open Chess Tournament at Stornoway.
Although Short started out as the favourite to win the tournament, the
experts are now putting their money on Polgar, 19, from Hungary, who is
tipped to become the heiress to Gary Kasparov's world title.
Polgar and her two sisters, Susana and Sofia, have taken the chess
world by storm.
They were educated at home by their father, Dr Laszlo Polgar, who has
accompanied his daughter to Stornoway. All three sisters have won
international competitions.
In the other fourth-round match, Scottish grandmaster Paul Motwani,
32, of Dundee, beat Norwegian Simen Agdestein, 28, in 41 moves.
Earlier yesterday, the chairman of Lewis Chess Club, Dr Alasdair
Macleod, lost to 11-year-old chess protege Luke McShane, from London, in
the third round of the tournament.
Luke, one of 230 competitors -- including several grandmasters --
taking part in the open competition, will be the youngest competitor in
the British Open Chess Championships which will be held in Swansea next
week.
Today the grandmasters will visit Museum nan Eilean, where the famous
twelfth-century Lewis ivory chessmen are on display. The chessmen are to
be taken out of their security showcase to give the grandmasters a
close-up look, although grandmasters will not be allowed to handle the
pieces.

DEPUTY Irish Prime Minister Dick Spring yesterday stressed ''the
primary importance'' of implementing all-party talks on the future of
Northern Ireland as soon as possible.
He also highlighted the ''regrettable'' worsening position of Irish
prisoners in British jails in recent weeks.
Mr Spring was speaking ahead of formal ratification by the Dail, the
Dublin Parliament, of the Council of Europe Convention on the transfer
of prisoners.
The move, accepted by the Dail without a vote, will permit IRA
personnel and Irish people serving sentences in Britain to be
transferred to jails in Eire, provided it is approved by the UK
Government as part of the peace process.
Mr Spring, who is also Ireland's Foreign Minister, had talks on Monday
with Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew. He said Dublin's views on the
prisoners issue had been relayed clearly.
''We will be continuing to explore actively with the British
authorities how the situation can most effectively and speedily be
resolved,'' he said.
Earlier, Mr Bruton warned that the establishment of an international
body to oversee the decommissioning of IRA weapons, another key issue
stalling the peace process, could not be rushed.
He also told the Dail, back from its summer recess to process a number
of outstanding bills, that he was against setting a deadline for the
start of all-party talks.

A THREE-YEAR-OLD boy and his grandfather were drowned on the east
coast of the Mull of Kintyre last night after their dinghy capsized.
The boy's mother and six-year-old sister swam to safety and raised the
alarm after the 10ft vessel capsized near Carradale just after 7pm.
A rescue operation involving a helicopter from HMS Gannet at
Prestwick, local fishing vessels, and coastguard officials was
immediately launched.
Strathclyde Police said the body of the grandfather, a semi-retired
businessman from Edinburgh, was recovered at 8.10pm. His grandson's body
was recovered 15 minutes later.
His daughter and granddaughter were treated for slight hypothermia in
hospital in Campbeltown.
The family, who are all from Edinburgh, were understood to have spent
the day at the beach at Carradale Bay and were making their way back to
the harbour at Carradale, around Carradale Point, when the dinghy
capsized 200 yards from the shore.
The grandfather is understood to have had a holiday home at Carradale
for about 18 years.
Police have not disclosed the name of the family.
Meanwhile, a 56-year-old man died last night after collapsing while
playing with his grand-daughter on the beach at Seamill, Ayrshire.
Police said he had been resuscitated by ambulance staff but was found
to be dead on arrival at Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock. The man is not
being identified at the request of his family.

ANIMAL rights campaigners were angry last night after livestock
exporters won a major legal battle.
Two High Court judges ruled police could not limit the number of times
transporters could ship livestock from a UK port.
The ruling was condemned by Compassion in World Farming and the RSPCA
said it was ''extremely dismayed''.
Lord Justice Balcombe and Mr Justice Popplewell said cuts in police
protection for livestock trucks travelling through the port of Shoreham
in west Sussex were unlawful.
Livestock transport company International Traders Ferry won an order
quashing policing restrictions imposed by Sussex Chief Constable Paul
Whitehouse.
Not policing Shoreham ''on a sufficient scale'' had the effect of
restricting exports in a way which contravened EU trade laws, the court
decided.
''The decision is important for the many British livestock farmers
whose livelihood depends on continuing a long-established trade with
continental Europe,'' said an ITF spokesman.
Animal welfare groups reacted angrily.
''I think this is going to increase people's frustration and make them
even more determined to stop this trade,'' said Mr John Callaghan,
education director at CIWF.
Mr Whitehouse was meeting legal experts today before deciding whether
to appeal against the High Court ruling.

Blair reforms continue as executive committee approves 20% reduction.
LABOUR'S National Executive Committee yesterday voted to reduce the
trade union share of the vote at party conferences from 70% to 50%,
marking the latest stage in leader Tony Blair's campaign to reform the
party.
The NEC voted by 22 votes to three, with only representatives of the
transport union RMT and the communication union UCW, and left-wing
Labour MP Dennis Skinner, opposing the change.
Although the move is expected to be approved at the party's autumn
conference in October, it will face stiff opposition from the left, who
see it as a betrayal of a Labour tradition.
Yesterday, the unions that backed the leadership warned they would
oppose any attempt to cut off completely the party's links with the
trade union movement, or any tampering with union sponsorship of MPs.
Union leaders have told Mr Blair they are not prepared to see their
influence reduced to below 50%, a guarantee he has not so far been
willing to give.
Mr Blair has argued for a sharp reduction in the union block vote as a
way of improving the party's electability. He wants a greater say to be
given to individual Labour members, whose numbers have increased to
300,000 since his election as leader last summer.
The measure, which would come into effect in 1996, would give
constituency parties and affiliated organisations 50% of the vote. The
sharp increase in party membership encouraged Mr Blair to press for an
immediate cut to 50%, rather than an intermediate level.
The motion at yesterday's NEC meeting was proposed by Mr Dan Duffy,
president of the powerful Transport and General Workers' Union, who last
year opposed Mr Blair's efforts to reform Clause 4 of the party
constitution. He was supported by other major unions, including GMB, the
general union, Unison, the public workers' union, and the AEEU, the
engineering union.
Mr Blair welcomed the vote as an important day for Labour and the
trade unions. ''People want strong, healthy, independent trade unions.
They just don't want to confuse them with elected government.''
The union share of the vote had been reduced from 90% in 1992, he
said. ''We have made massive strides to becoming a more democratic, mass
membership party in touch with the people of Britain.
''I believe the decision taken today with overwhelming support will
broaden and deepen our appeal to a public tired of the Tories and
looking to Labour for real change.''
The AEEU's acting general secretary, Mr Ken Jackson, yesterday
stressed the importance of retaining union sponsorship of MPs, by which
MPs receive financial assistance with election and office costs. ''We
have a very firm line that we want to keep our sponsored MPs,'' he said.
''If Mr Blair is divorcing himself from the unions, that is all the
more reason why we need our representation in Parliament. The majority
of our MPs are former manual workers who have been given special
training by ourselves to help their political career and we want this
system to continue.''
The NEC also voted by 17 to six against the selection of Ms Liz Davies
as prospective parliamentary candidate for Leeds North East and referred
her case to a disciplinary committee over allegations that she failed to
disclose a prison sentence for non-payment of her poll tax.
President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang dismissed the reform as
predictable and pointed out it left the union block vote in control of
half the conference vote. Mr Blair was ''embarrassed'' to be associated
with ''his party's trade union paymasters'', he said.
''The flip-side of today's reform is that Labour's constituency
parties have a greater say in Labour policy-making. The resolutions
submitted last week by the constituency parties for debate at this
year's conference confirms that Labour remains a Socialist party rooted
in the discredited ideologies of the past,'' he said.

THIEVES have stolen a defibrillator, used to restart the heart in
emergencies, from a parked ambulance.
The Laerdal Medical Heartstart 2000 was taken when the vehicle was
stationed at its depot at Edenhall Hospital in Musselburgh, East
Lothian, on Monday night.
The 18in by 24in machine was in a blue canvas bag which also contained
batteries, pads, and electrodes.
A hospital spokesman said: ''In this day and age, I would have thought
people realised ambulances are not there to do anything other than help
people. It is irresponsible to steal such life-saving equipment. These
are worth their weight in gold in terms of what they can do.''
Ambulance security could not be tightened further because vital
seconds could be lost in an emergency, he said.
''We have to have vehicles ready and available. If we were to lock
them away, it could take ages to get them out again.''

WHEN Diane Modahl was branded a doping cheat -- falsely, as it turned
out yesterday -- by a British Athletic Federation inquiry which refused
to believe that a urine sample could lie, there were no celebrations at
the headquarters of the International Amateur Athletic Federation's
Monacco headquarters.
''How can you be pleased when the verdict humiliates the sport
again?'' said Mr Chris Winner, spokesman for the world governing body of
the sport. ''It is a paradox to be pleased about this.''
There were even fewer celebrations yesterday, when an even greater
paradox occured. The original 5-0 guilty verdict was overturned, 3-0, in
Modahl's favour, as the former Commonwealth 800 metres champion was
cleared.
But Modahl's legitimate hope that her nightmare is over may be in
vain. The zeal with which the IAAF pursued and overturned verdicts in
favour of Butch Reynolds and Katrin Krabbe suggests they will fight this
to the limit.
That impression was confirmed last night when a spokesman said: ''The
IAAF's legal adviser in London was informed that new evidence was
produced, seemingly of a theoretical nature and based on remote
possibilities, but is baffled why this was not offered to the BAF to
allow the federation to make a thorough investigation and provide a
satisfactory and considered response.
''It should be made clear that the final decision regarding the
eligibility of any athlete lies only with the IAAF which will now
consider this new development in the case.''
Make no mistake. This verdict humiliate athletics again -- totally
discrediting its anti-doping legislation, in a week when an English
schoolboy pentathlete was also cleared.
The credibility of the Lisbon testing laboratory where Modahl's sample
was incorrectly stored is the least of the issues at stake. The
International Olympic Committee, which licenses laboratories, will be
forced to re-examine their criteria, not just for this lab, but for
anti-doping worldwide, in all sports.
The panel which exonerated Modahl -- chaired by Robert Reid QC, a
member of the FA commission which found against Arsenal manager George
Graham -- relieved the 29-year-old athlete from the sporting equivalent
of the innocent condemned to the gallows. Her husband, Vicente, feared
at one stage that she was suicidal.
But their verdict will haunt the testers, bruising belief in the
righteousness of their cause.
Some of the world's most authoritative experts, including the Sports
Council's best, testified that Modahl must knowingly have administered
testosterone to achieve a level of 42-1 (normal is accepted as being no
more than 6-1). But the testimony of Professor Simon Gaskill convinced
them that hormone levels can radically alter if poorly stored.
Modahl has indicated she would like to resume her running career. ''I
have been in athletics since the age of 11,'' she said. ''The sport has
been of great importance to Vicente and me and I am sure it will
continue to be so.''
Asked whether he would like to coach his wife to next year's Atlanta
Olympics Vicente said: ''That would be a fantastic thing. But at the end
of the day she has to come to terms with what has happened.''
Tony Ward, spokesman for the BAF said: ''We are delighted at the
outcome because Diane is a great champion and because it proves our
appeals procedure obviously works.''
Some will question that, in the light of Modahl's one-year ordeal.
Modahl had tested positive at a low key track and field meeting in
Lisbon in June 1994. Since then she has consistently protested her
innocence. She has been sustained throughout by her husband and the
British athletics team doctor, Malcolm Brown, a Liverpool-based Scottish
surgeon and Glasgow University graduate who survived a campaign for his
resignation because of his continued support of the athlete.
From the outset Brown insisted she was innocent, despite the apparent
strong evidence to the contrary, and in the face of an underground
campaign to have him resign.
''This must never happen to an athlete again,'' said Brown who spent
four years in Scottish athletics and six with the British governing
body. ''I believe BAF and the IAAF should conduct an urgent review of
their procedures. BAF must look at the way they deal with an abnormal
reading when it arises. This is the kind of thing which can happen when
people are over-zealous.''
In passing, the verdict will be of considerable interest to Scottish
Tour de France cyclist Robert Millar, who was condemned as a drug cheat
on the strength of a sample stored in similarly hot conditions. Millar
told The Herald he had watched the proceedings with interest.
One convincing and compelling piece of evidence of Modahl's innocence,
though circumstantial, has disturbed me since I was first made aware of
it. It was the athlete's hysterical reaction to the possibility that she
might have cancer.
It was reported, in this paper and others, that medical evidence
suggested one way such abnormal hormone readings could have been
achieved by an innocent party was if Modahl had a malignancy. She called
friends in a panic, asking if the positive test meant she had cancer.
''Her response was far too convincing to have been feigned,'' said one.
They were rejoicing with Modahl last night.

NORTHERN Constabulary's investigations into the fire at the Four
Seasons Hotel in Aviemore in the early hours of New Year's Day has now
turned into a nationwide murder inquiry.
Two people died at the Stakis- owned hotel after a fire had been
discovered in the kitchen area about 4.55am: Mr Graham Strachan, 64, a
director of Scott Lithgow; and Mrs Patricia Shaw, 55, of Kippax in
Leeds.
Mr Strachan had been trying to escape down a firestair which was
filled with choking smoke. His wife, Catherine, survived but spent some
time in intensive care at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.
Mrs Shaw was thought to have suffered a heart attack when being
evacuated from the building by a fireman who had climbed a ladder to
reach her bedroom window.
The hotel has been closed since but is due to reopen on Tuesday. The
head of Northern Constabulary's CID, Superintendent George Gough, would
not confirm that he was now involved in a murder investigation, saying
only: ''I can confirm that a report on the circumstances of the fire has
been submitted to the procurator-fiscal in Inverness. Otherwise I have
no comment to make.''
Mrs Strachan, however, said yesterday: ''The police have contacted my
eldest son and told him that the fire was started deliberately. It has
come as a bit of a shock to all of us, especially after seven months,
but now they have established it, I hope they catch the culprit very
quickly.''

'While Smith and Murray move and spend, Celtic stumble from one
transfer letdown to another'
RANGERS swooped to sign defender Gordan Petric from Dundee United
yesterday and emphasised yet again just how far they are pushing
themselves ahead of the rest of Scottish football.
The Ibrox side look likely to boost their summer spending spree by
another #1.5m today when Oleg Salenko appears in Glasgow for signing
talks. The Valencia-based Russian had been linked with the Ibrox side
and now it seems he will join Petric in a double signing which
emphasises the club's determined spending policy.
Already they have spent #6m on Paul Gascoigne and Gordan Petric, and
have agreed a #1.5m fee with Aberdeen for Stephen Wright. Salenko now
joins that summer signing cast.
Petric had been a target for Celtic. It appeared that they had refused
to meet the asking price of Tannadice chairman Jim McLean.
But yesterday, Rangers manager Walter Smith, who had jetted back from
his club's pre-season tour of Denmark, agreed terms with his mentor and
Petric will be playing for Rangers in the European Cup.
The gap between the Glasgow giants appears to grow wider and wider.
There is no doubt that Smith and his chairman, David Murray, want
success in Europe this season, and Rangers do want another striker.
Rangers also know that their vast support wants to find further
success at home, particularly by winning 10 championships in succession
and so defeating the Celtic record set up by the late Jock Stein.
While Smith and Murray move and spend, Celtic stumble from one
transfer letdown to another, something which must make their now vast
army of shareholders wonder what is happening.
The loss of Petric, who was signed by United from Partizan Belgrade
for #600,000 almost two years ago, is a bitter blow to manager Tommy
Burns who saw him as an integral part of his defence in the coming
season.
Burns believed he had agreed a deal with his Dundee United
counterpart, Billy Kirkwood, before leaving on the club's tour of
Germany.
The fact that Rangers had time to move in for the Slav defender will
do nothing to foster relations between Burns and Celtic chairman, Fergus
McCann, who authorises all transactions at Parkhead.
With emerging Scotland defender Brian O'Neil out until the new year,
Burns needed a high quality replacement. Now he must resume his search
on the continent, but, as a club source pointed out last night, the
available talent diminishes every day and it will now become even more
difficult for him to find the right man.
Rangers' capture will also cause bitter resentment among the Celtic
support who have seen the club upstaged once again in the transfer
market at a time when there was ample finance to clinch a deal.
Petric will now settle into the new Ibrox defensive formation which
Smith insists he will persevere with in the new season. It is one that
the former Yugoslav international will be happy with, a style of play he
always has been used to.
Smith wants to play three central defenders and now he will do so in a
back five which is composed entirely of international players.
There will be Stephen Wright and David Robertson pushing forward from
the full back positions and in the middle Richard Gough will team up
with Alan McLaren and the new signing Petric.
Behind them there will be the rejuvenated Andy Goram, all of which
presents an awesome picture for the rest of the Scottish premier
division.
Yesterday, as he was completing the deal, Smith said: ''Whenever we
heard that Petric was available we moved to get him.
''We believe that we need to play with three at the back and he will
fit into this superbly. I am delighted to get him. We wanted to spend
money this summer for our supporters and we have done so.''
I understand that Smith has been tracking the defender for some months
but once he was alerted that United would be ready to sell he made his
move swiftly.
As the Celtic deal collapsed, Smith moved in and now Petric will be
with the champions and Celtic must, once again, look elsewhere.
It is a blow for the prestige of the Parkhead club, and a blow for
their owner, Fergus McCann, who has still to deliver the major signings
he has promised.

NINE men were in custody in Glasgow police stations last night after a
series of operations under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
One is understood to be Mr Lindsay Robb, a member of a fringe Loyalist
group who took part in the peace-process talks with the Government
earlier this year. He was detained by police on Merseyside yesterday and
brought north for questioning.
Mr Robb, 44, a member of the central executive of the Progressive
Unionist Party, has visited Stormont with other PUP leaders on at least
two occasions, including discussions in March with Mr Michael Ancram,
the Minister of State at the Irish Office.
A leading party member, Mr David Ervine, said last night: ''We have
received independent confirmation that a member of our delegation to
Stormont has been arrested in Scotland.''
Mr Robb's detention followed three operations by the two police forces
sharing the operation, Strathclyde and Central Scotland.
Three men, aged 48, 40, and 29, were held in Airdrie on Sunday, while
five others, aged 47, 46, 28, 24, and 23, were detained in the Glasgow
area on Monday and Tuesday.
It is believed more arrests may follow, although police have refused
to give any details other than to say that Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth had approved the necessary extensions to the detention orders.
The PUP, which includes former members of the outlawed Ulster
Volunteer Force, is credited with being close to the thinking of the
Loyalist terror group.
In December last year, Mr Robb was a member of a PUP delegation which
met Government officials at Stormont.
Mr Robb, who lives in County Armagh and describes himself as a
part-time journalist, was the only member of the PUP delegation at
Stormont in March not to have terrorist convictions.
Sunday's operation in Airdrie appears to have been the culmination of
a lengthy surveillance operation. A police car was used to ram a Renault
car carrying three men in the town centre, while other police vehicles
blocked surrounding routes.
Armed officers wearing body armour spreadeagled the men on the ground
for a period while a box and plastic bags were removed from the Renault.
It is now believed that the vehicle had come from England and that two
small arms were among the material removed by the police. Early reports
suggested that a quantity of drugs was also recovered.
One of the men detained is understood to live in Airdrie with his wife
and young daughter, having moved to Scotland from Northern Ireland when
he was young. The other two live in the Falkirk area, at Laurieston and
Bonnybridge.
Sources at Airdrie said yesterday that the dramatic arrests were
captured on both the town's closed circuit television cameras, which are
monitored by police, and on CCTV at a nearby petrol station. Police
officers are understood to have taken away the filling station tape.

THE bunker might be man-made, but the view over Loch Lomond (left)
from the par-3 seventeenth is perfectly natural and will provide the
spectacular backdrop for the European Tour's latest event.
It was announced yesterday that the Tom Weiskopf-designed course,
presently in only its second playing season, will host the European
Tour's return to the West of Scotland next year.
The Loch Lomond World Invitational will be played from September 19 to
22 as a joint venture by Carnegie Sports International and the co-owners
of the club, the Lyle Anderson Company, already involved in such
ventures in the United States, and DMB, a privately-held American
investment company.
The development is a far cry from the uncertain situation of only two
years ago. The course was started in 1990 but the developers, Stirling
Investments, ran out of money and administrators were called in. As the
major creditor, the Bank of Scotland decided not to dispose of what was
seen as a promising asset but to complete the project.
The final terms of the agreement with Anderson, who has been involved
in major golf and property projects in Arizona, Hawaii, and New Mexico,
had never been disclosed but the course cost #7m to build and was part
of an original package including clubhouse, marina, and hotel
developments valued at #52m.

<HEADLINE>Repossessions rise south of Border. Survey shows crisis for home owners</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977191165</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE housing market in England and Wales lurched deeper into crisis
yesterday with publication of figures showing the first rise in home
repossessions since 1991.
In the first six months of 1995, 25,200 properties were taken back
from borrowers in debt by banks and building societies compared with
24,190 in the second half of 1994, according to the Council of Mortgage
Lenders.
The 4% rise in repossessions brought to an end the steady improvement
seen since the second half of 1991, when the figure peaked at 38,930.
Lenders claim the upturn marks the beginning of a new trend,
predicting that planned cuts in income support for homeowners losing
their jobs will lead to more repossessions in the months ahead.
Mr Mike Jackson, chief executive of Birmingham Midshire Building
Society, warned it may be the start of a renewed epidemic.
''After two years of improving arrears and possession statistics, the
fire is flaring up again,'' he said.
However, the Government claimed the rise was just a blip. A Department
of the Environment spokesman said the increase in repossessions
reflected a rise in the number of court orders passed last year as
lenders cracked down on heavily indebted borrowers.
Since then, court orders had fallen, suggesting that the number of
repossessions would ''dip again later in the year''.
He highlighted the decrease in the number of long-term arrears. At the
end of June, there were 94,710 mortgages more than 12 months in arrears,
19% down on the end of 1994.
Mr Adrian Coles, director general of the CML, defended lenders, saying
there was a hard core of long-term arrears cases whose circumstances had
not improved.
In taking back their properties, lenders were being ''cruel to be
kind'', he said.
Mr Coles said there was a range of reasons for the increases in
repossessions, including the slowdown in the rate at which unemployment
was falling.
Latest figures showed a 4200 fall in the jobless total in June
compared to a monthly average of 27,000 over the last year.
The weakness of the housing market -- with prices down about 2% from a
year ago, falling sales, and more than a million people with negative
equity --was also to blame since it made it difficult for householders
to sell up and cut their losses, said Mr Coles.
Analysts say many homeowners are simply handing back their keys to
lenders in despair.
Mr Coles said he accepted there was no realistic prospect of the
Government dropping its income support plans but called for them to take
action in the form of a housing market rescue plan, to be implemented
before the Budget, to prevent prices falling any further.
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson said the figures showed the
''Tories' housing crisis is getting worse''.
The rise in repossessions meant ''more families without a home, more
in debt, more pressure on local councils and housing associations'', he
said.
''And the only change the Government is making is a change for the
worse. They are taking away the income support safety net for borrowers
who lose their jobs.''
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux said borrowers
were being squeezed ''between a rock and a hard place''.
It said: ''The same Government that encouraged people on low incomes
to take on the commitment of home ownership is now turning its back on
them when the going gets tough.
''At the same time, mortgage lenders, seeing no prospect of an upturn
in the housing market, have decided to cut their losses by clearing the
backlog of long-term arrears and getting tough with borrowers in trouble
at a much earlier stage.
''All this is happening when it is harder than ever for people to find
affordable homes to rent.''

IF Tory right-wingers try to cut the Scottish budget ''it will be over
my dead body'', said Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday.
''That's what I feel.''
Twenty-four hours earlier the right-wingers had proposed to the
Chancellor that expenditure in Scotland should be on a per capita basis.
Mr Forsyth declared that such a proposition was out of the question.
''The expenditure that we get for Scotland is based on need and if
people want to argue about that expenditure, well let them argue whether
or not it is justified.
''To suggest that we should just have a level of expenditure across
the UK regardless of need, regardless of sparsity of population,
regardless of the nature of Scotland, is just ridiculous. This is not a
proposal that will carry any weight. I am perfectly happy to defend our
expenditure on the basis of is it value for money? Is it justified?''
This was a slap in the face for erstwhile right-wing soul mates in the
Tory Parliamentary Party. Their 92 Group has put in a pre-Budget paper
to the Chancellor advocating that the Exchequer Grant for Scotland and
Wales should be calculated on a population basis -- suggesting a massive
cut of about a quarter in Mr Forsyth's budget for next year..
He told The Herald yesterday: ''I would no more argue for having a set
percentage, getting on for a quarter more per head north of the Border
than south of the Border. So they are actually talking about cutting
expenditure by a huge amount. I'm not going to go along with that in any
circumstances. Basis of need, that is how we should determine public
expenditure.''
Mr Forsyth, one of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's most
ardent supporters, insists that he has changed his basic principles and
ideas since becoming Secretary of State.
He claims that a decade ago his job was to argue as a ''young Turk''
for the use of market forces and enterprise to defeat poverty and
improve education and health. ''That argument has been won. Now it's a
matter of delivery.''
He claims that his experience in Government will help him achieve the
delivery; he knows better how to go about it.
He offers not consensus politics in Scotland but a partnership,
particularly with the local authorities. ''There is a whole raft of
things which in partnership with local government we can achieve. I'm
keen to find ways to give local authorities more freedom and giving them
some of the powers and responsibilites that are exercised centrally so
that they can be exercised locally.
''And in turn, I want them to devolve power downwards to community
councils, tenants' associations, school boards, other organisations --
so that we can address what is undoubtedly a widespread and real feeling
that people want to have more say over their own affairs.''
He wants a bigger role for the Scottish Grand Committee and he will
even contemplate the possibility of it initiating legislation. ''That's
certainly something that we can look at,'' he said. ''Of course
Westminister is the legislative body and legislation would have to
command a majority, but I am certainly prepared to look at ways in which
we can use the Grand Committee more effectively.''
But he added: ''I am not going to do anything to undermine our ability
to maintain the Union or maintain the outstandingly high levels of
prosperity that we now enjoy in Scotland.
''Everything is going so well except of course in the Tory Party, 11%
in the polls. Clearly we are getting things wrong and we have got to try
to address peoples' concerns which go well beyond the normal currency of
political debate.''
His two immediate battles are the future of the West Highland railway
line and the Torry Agriculture Research Centre at Aberdeen. ''On issues
like this we will fight our corner. There is a case to be made. On the
Fort William service I support privatisation as a way to improve
services not as a way of diminishing services.
''It seems to me quite wrong that an important service like Fort
William should be lost. We have lobbied hard and it does seem to me that
there is a way forward which is in the interest of the taxpayer and will
maintain a service.''
He is in negotiation with Transport Secretary Sir George Young and the
franchise director in this cause. The Torry Research Centre is in the
hands of the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Douglas Hogg. Mr Forsyth says
that he is trying to make a case for at least some of the research work
remaining in Scotland.
The ''new look'' Michael Forsyth intends to devote himself to
restoring Tory fortunes in Scotland in the time given to him by the
Prime Minister before the next election. He has hired a right-wing
polemicist in Mr Gerald Warner to ensure that he and his Ministers get
the Tory message across clearly and concisely. As his special adviser it
is not his job to tutor the Scottish Secretary on his views -- but to
employ his journalist's skill to getting them across.
The Scottish Office Ministers are to spend less time in St Andrew's
House, Edinburgh, and more time out and about forming what he calls a
dialogue with the people. Mr Warner is to help them too in this
exercise.
Mr Forsyth is acutely aware that there are only another 92 weeks
maximum before the next General Election and that he and the Tories in
Scotland will sink or swim on the success or otherwise of his
leadership.
He is basing much of his hope on galvanising private finance to meet
Scotland's needs over and above what the taxpayer can afford to deliver.

St Pauli Hamburg 0, Celtic 0
CELTIC put their disappointments on and off the park behind them last
night to produce their best performance of the German tour.
But there was a further blow for manager Tommy Burns when defender Lee
Martin was taken to hospital after the game with a suspected broken arm.
Despite limited options, the Scots comfortably contained
newly-promoted Bundesliga side St Pauli before a 13,000 crowd, and the
manner of their disciplined and determined performance was most
encouraging for Burns, who said later: ''I could not praise my players
highly enough on a difficult night.
''They did everything asked of them. I am certain they will now go on
to greater things. We have gained the match fitness needed on this tour,
and can look ahead with confidence to higher-profile games.''
The Hamburg team was the toughest opposition in their four-game tour,
but even without striker Pierre van Hooydonk, who failed a late fitness
test on a hamstring injury, Celtic gave as good as they got against the
newly-promoted Bundesliga team.
Admittedly, the Germans exerted most of the pressure, but Celtic's
appetite for the fray was unquenchable. Their form was in marked
contrast to the earlier games, in which they lost twice to part-time
amateur teams from the third division.
At last this was a Celtic performance which lived up to the
expectations of their large and vocal support.
St Pauli were first to threaten, when Ralph Becker attempted a 20-yard
snap shot which rasped off a post and was cleared. Celtic found it
difficult to sustain any threat as Walker was left to plough a lone
furrow in attack.
Tony Mowbray, re-instated to the heart of the defence, was a tower of
strength and made several telling tackles to disrupt the Germans'
rhythm.
Albanian Rudi Vata created the best chance of the opening half when he
released Walker in space, but the striker's attempt drifted tamely past.
As the Germans regrouped, Mowbray made a telling interception when he
deprived Jouri Sevitchevitche as the Slav broke through.
At the outset of the second half Martin was replaced by Willie
Falconer as Celtic opted for more attacking options, although in 60
minutes Tosh McKinlay was brought on for Brian McLaughlin, when Burns
seemed to settle for avoiding defeat.
St Pauli made three changes at the start of the second half, but it
was Celtic who gained in confidence, comfortably containing all their
efforts.
Increasingly, St Pauli ran out of attacking ideas and resorted to
long-range attempts. But in the closing minutes veteran Irish keeper Pat
Bonner had to produce a magnificent save from Christian Springer to deny
the Germans.
ST PAULI HAMBURG -- Thomforde, Damamman, Pederson, Turulsen, Hanke,
Dinzey, Springer, Popper, Becker, Savitche, Schweibing.  Substitutes --
Mayer, Manzi, Stisi, Stanislavski, Sobotzick, Szubert, Froaling.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Martin, Gray, McNally, Mowbray, Grant, McLaughlin,
Donnelly, Walker, Vata, Collins.  Substitutes -- Falconer, Marshall,
McKinlay, MacKay.

A FORMER rag and bone man, whose hard work made him a millionaire,
became a National Lottery jackpot winner yesterday when he and his
business partner collected a cheque for #2.5m.
Mr Mel Eddison, 47, and his partner, Mr John Biesty, both from Greater
Manchester, who built up their pallet-building and garage business from
nothing, toasted their success at the presentation at Liverpool's Liver
building yesterday.
Mr Eddison, a father of three, told how he was forced to start up his
own business because he left the army and was unable to read or write.
He heard about the win only when he received a phone call, while on
holiday in the family's French chateau, telling him to check the
numbers.
A jubilant Mr Eddison, who now plans to buy his wife Patricia a
Mercedes sports car, said: ''My son Neil phoned me and asked me to check
my numbers . . . so I got out my card and, wallop, I realised I'd won.
''It was a fabulous feeling, all my debts just disappeared into thin
air.
''People think that just because you are a millionaire you stop having
money worries but that is not true. You still have to worry about where
the next Rolex is coming from.''
Twenty members of the tightly-knit Eddison family, from Failsworth,
near Oldham, including the couple's three sons -- Darren, 30, Justin,
22, and Neil, 18 -- gathered at the family house, which has its own gym
and roof garden, on hearing the news.
They then crossed the Channel to begin a 48-hour party at their
holiday home, knocking back 30 bottles of champagne when they got there.
Mr and Mrs Eddison cut their holiday short to collect the winnings but
plan to return to pick up where they left off as soon as the fuss dies
down.
The 25 staff at the business partners' factory were thrilled to hear
of their bosses' scoop -- especially when they announced they planned to
invest a good share of the winnings back into the firm.
Mr Eddison, who taught himself to read and write at the age of 34,
said he hoped to take on more workers and put his days as a rag and bone
man even further behind him.
Mr Biesty, 46, who was worth half a million, told how he was a
carpet-fitter in Bury before he teamed up with Mr Eddison seven years
ago.

A PSYCHIATRIC hospital chief raped women patients, a court was told
yesterday.
Mr Norman McBain, now 70, formerly of Kirklands Hospital, Bothwell,
Lanarkshire, used his position as senior nursing officer to prey on
patients for sex, it was claimed.
Mr McBain, who retired in 1979, appeared at the High Court in Airdrie,
accused of raping five patients on a number of occasions from 1969.
A jury of 10 women and five men heard how the vulnerable women were
subjected to sex ordeals and told to keep quiet or face punishment.
Mr McBain, of Hilton House, Hilton, near Banff, denied all the
charges.
The first of the women to give evidence, Miss Z, 37, is still a
patient at Kirklands.
She said: ''He took me into the porter's room. He told me to strip. He
said he was sterilised and couldn't make me pregnant. I just got
stripped. I was scared. He told me not to tell anyone or I would get put
away.
''He lay on top of me. I told him he was too heavy but he just carried
on . . . I was just 19 or 20.''
Miss Z said she was raped more than once by the accused.
Former patient Mrs V told how, during her stay at Kirklands, Mr McBain
came into the bathroom and ''touched'' her as she left the bath.
She said he would often come to her room at night.
Mrs V, now 62, told how, on one occasion, Mr McBain raped her.
She said: ''He pulled the bedclothes down and pulled my pants down and
started interfering with me.
''At first he used his hands then he used the whole of his body.''
Mrs V also claimed she had been raped on more than one occasion.
Another former patient, Miss W, told how she was raped by Mr McBain at
a house in Bellshill.
Miss W, now 59, said she was at the house ill in bed when Mr McBain
came to see her.
She said: ''He touched me where he shouldn't have touched me. He
touched me top and bottom. He forced himself on me.
''It happened quite a few times. If there was no-one around, he would
come over to the female hostel.
''He said to me if I didn't do what he said I would be longer in
hospital, that I wouldn't get out of the hospital. I was very nervous of
him.''
Cross-examined by defence counsel Gordon Jackson, QC, she denied
making up the stories.
The trial before Lord Gill continues.

COLIN McRae and Derek Ringer have their sights on a hat trick of
victories when New Zealand's round of the World Rally Championship gets
under way today in Manukau City, near Auckland.
The Scots start the four-day, 2000 kilometres event with the eyes of
the rally world on them -- and for 26-year-old McRae a huge weight of
responsibility on his shoulders.
In the enforced absense of his Subaru team-mate, Carlos Sainz, success
may prove crucial to his and his team's bid to win the world
championships' for both drivers and manufacturers.
Sainz, winner in New Zealand in 1990, '91 and '92, currently leads the
world championship after four of the eight rounds, but the Spaniard is
unable to defend his 12-point advantage after falling from his mountain
bike and tearing a shoulder ligament.
Deputising for Sainz in the third Subaru Impreza is Richard Burns from
Reading, navigated by Robert Reid from Spittal, near Perth.
Victory on Sunday will bring McRae to within 10 points of the former
world champion, but he is not looking too far ahead.
''I had an excellent finish to last season and know I'm capable of
repeating that success again. However, it's premature to start thinking
about world championships. For now I'll focus my energy on winning each
event as it comes along,'' said McRae.
World class opposition comes from former world champions Juha
Kankkunen, and Didier Auriol, both driving Toyotas. Lining up for Andrew
Cowan's Mitsubishi Lancer team are Tommi Makinen and Kenneth Eriksson,
who McRae beat into second place on the Indonesia rally earlier this
month.
The British-based Ford team are pinning their hopes on 1994 Monte
Carlo winner Francois Delecour and Bruno Thiry, who came within one
stage of winning the previous championship round in Corsica.
Meanwhile, McRae's brother Alister is in Belfast this weekend aiming
to improve on his equal second place in the Mobil 1/Top Gear British
Rally Championship. Ready to deny 24-year-old McRae vital points in the
Stena Sealink Ulster Rally are Kelso's Dominic Buckley in a VW Golf and
Kilmarnock's Robbie Head in a Renault Clio.
Head's team-mate, Frenchman Alain Oreille, leads the championship by
one point after three of the five rounds.
Tom Coughtrie, from Ayr, driving a Subaru Legacy, is bidding to retain
his lead in the Production Cup for amateur drivers.
The 450 mile Ulster Rally, which has attracted 80 entrants, starts in
Belfast on Friday and finishes there on Saturday.

BRIDE-to-be Catriona Morrison will be keeping it in the family for not
one but two big days next week.
On Tuesday, following in her mother Margaret's footsteps, she will
achieve her ambition of being ordained a Church of Scotland minister.
The service will be conducted at her mother's charge, Stenhouse St
Aidans Parish Church in Edinburgh. Her father, Peter, who will also take
part in the service, is an elder and reader at the church.
Three days later, her mother will conduct the wedding service when
Catriona marries Mr Marc Prowe, 28, at Whittinghame Church, East
Lothian, where she served as a probationer assistant for 18 months. Mr
Prowe is a theology graduate in Germany.
The couple met when Catriona took part in an exchange visit to Germany
during her divinity studies at New College in Edinburgh.
The week after their wedding the couple will move to Germany, where
Catriona will take up part-time ministry in Hambach.
During a break from last- minute preparations for one of the busiest
weeks of her life, the 28-year-old said she learned only a few weeks ago
that her two big days would be so close together.
She also spoke of her joy at taking up her charge in Germany. ''I'm
looking forward to working in the congregation. It's what I have been
trained for.''

* GREG Rusedski was jeered as he made an unhappy return to his
birthplace of Montreal for the Canadian Open. The world No.50 had a ball
thrown at him and was booed throughout his 7-6, 6-3 first-round defeat
by American Michael Joyce.
Rusedski recently rejected his Canadian citizenship to become a
British subject and the move had obviously not gone down well with the
partisan crowd.
As Rusedski walked off court the crowd serenaded him with the refrain
from an old song: ''Hey, Hey, Hey, Na, Na, Na, Na, Wave Goodbye.''
Rusedski responded: ''It didn't hurt my feelings. I thought I'd get a
difficult reaction. I prepared for it and I expected it.''
He had the last laugh when he and doubles partner Wekesa beat Canadian
pair Sebastien Lareau and Sebastien Leblanc 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a
first-round match.
It proved a disappointing day for Jeremy Bates, who was beaten 7-5,
6-2 by Richard Krajicek of Holland.
Spain's Sergi Bruguera and Sweden's Stefan Edberg both won their
opening matches in the #1.2m tournament.

FORMER British Davis Cup player Nick Fulwood heads an impressive men's
entry for next week's Bank of Scotland Scottish Hard Court Tennis
Championship at Dundee's Games Club, writes Judy Murray.
The 32-year-old coach from Derbyshire, ranked as high as No.4 in
Britain in 1988, has been tempted north of the Border by his pupil of
two years, Ken Wood, the defending champion.
The Dunfermline player, who last week retained his national
grass-court title, said: ''It might not be in my best interests for Nick
to play, but it will certainly be good for the tournament. We all need
something to aim at, but for some years now Scottish events have not
attracted players from other countries and that is a problem which needs
to be rectified.''
Wood, who raised more than a few eyebrows on Monday when he switched
allegiance from the East of Scotland to make his debut for Derbyshire,
his birthplace, in the British Inter County Championships, will open his
campaign in the 12-player tableau finale on Wednesday along with
Fulwood, top English junior Simon Crabtree, Jason Barnett and Malcolm
Watt.
Dundee teenager Jennifer Duncan makes her first competitive appearance
in Scotland since entering the world ranking at No.892 in April and is
favourite to succeed Alison Reid as women's champion.
Reid, who tackles her older sister Fiona in the first round, could
face Duncan in a repeat of last year's semi-final, while grass-court
champion Heather Lockhart and last year's runner-up Allison Wood are
tipped to clash in the bottom half of the draw.

DETECTIVES have smashed a major conspiracy to defraud the banking
system of millions of pounds using fake cashpoint and credit cards.
Officers arrested 10 men in a series of raids on addresses in
south-east London and Kent yesterday in an operation codenamed Zingle.
Around 100,000 cards were seized, along with computer equipment and
machines used to insert information on the cards' magnetic strips.
The operation was co-ordinated by the cheque and credit card squad of
the Metropolitan Police organised crime group and was heralded as a
major success against hi-tech crime by police, who said it had
frustrated ''probably the biggest ever'' cashpoint fraud.
The recovered cards were plastic and already bore magnetic information
strips but had yet to have any particular bank or credit card company's
logo or other identifying marks printed on them.
Equipment was also recovered in raids on properties in Liverpool.
The arrested men were being questioned at police stations across
London and the South-east. Scotland Yard said further arrests were
expected.
Detective Superintendent Chris Craig agreed that the fraud had the
potential of netting more than #100m a year. He said the gang had access
to 100,000 cards, of which 80,000 had been recovered. It was not known
what happened to the remaining 20,000 but police do not believe they are
in circulation.
The source of the cards is being investigated.

AFTER three days of indifferent breezes and mixed overhead conditions,
Loch Long Week at last managed to combine all the required elements into
a perfect mix for ideal racing conditions off Gourock and Kilcreggan,
writes Andi Robertson.
A moderate easterly breeze remained steady in direction and increased
throughout the full Olympic triangle type course, which started with a
testing beat to the Ironotter mark followed by a spinnaker reach to
Kilcreggan.
Although it was Graham Hutchinson in Boomerang who led the first
circuit, by the finish he had succumbed to the pressure from Murray
Caldwell, who steered Rebel to victory with Gourock's Ian Harris second
in Iceni.
Overall standings have yet to be computed this week since a final
resolution to the problems of redress requested by number of boats for
Sunday's opening race has not been settled. Finish times for the first
round were used after the finish boat had to go off station to rescue a
sinking competitor and there are claims from boats who were better
placed at the conclusion of the normal race.
Duncan Farquhar's fifth place in Sula yesterday should, however,
maintain the Cove boat's hold on the championship. Result:
Race 4 -- 1, Rebel (M Caldwell); 2, Iceni (I Harris); 3, Zephyr (C
Still); 4, Boomerang (G Hutchinson); 5, Sula (D Farquhar).
MIKE Golding has hit back at the critics who have claimed that
Britain's chances of lifting this year's Admiral's Cup, which begins
today at Cowes, are already on the rocks.
Accusations have been levelled at the Royal Yachting Association for
failing to fully organise Britain's challenge for an event dubbed the
unofficial world championship of off-shore yacht racing.
But Golding, who skippers the smallest of Britain's three vessels in
the Mumm 36-class group four, said: ''It's true to say we have had our
difficulties this time around, but I don't think we are any different to
anyone else.
''There were difficulties finding the boats we need to take part in
the Admiral's Cup, but everyone has experienced similar problems. We
have three good, fast yachts and three talented crews.
''I would like to think we have as good a chance as anyone -- if we
didn't, there would be no point in taking part.''
Britain's hastily assembled squad contains a blend of youth and
experience with Robin Aisher skippering Seahorse, Britain's largest
boat, while Harold Cudmore has switched from his native Ireland to
captain Seahorse Astro.
But Britain's top yachtsman, Lawrie Smith, will be racing for the
United States, and the highly-rated Eddie Warden-Owen has signed up for
the Italians.

Hvidovre 1, Rangers 2
PAUL Gascoigne scored again for Rangers last night, just as he had
done in their first tour game, and spelled out to the fans in Copenhagen
just how important he may be for the Scottish champions in the season
which lies ahead.
Gascoigne made a nonsense of the suggestions that there had been
something ''mysterious'' about his non-appearance in Esbjerg the other
night.
He had been rested by Walter Smith for no other reason than the Ibrox
manager felt he needed a break after having played in the closed-doors
games back in Scotland.
Last night he played for 73 minutes before going off, along with local
hero Brian Laudrup, to an ovation from the fans in this suburb of the
Danish capital.
Gascoigne deserved the accolade. He had displayed a fair portion of
his repertoire, flicks, turns, back-heels, and killing passes -- as
well, of course, as a goal. There was no doubt that the #4.3m buy is up
and ready for the Ibrox tournament this weekend.
Rangers played close to their best side. Richard Gough and Alan
McLaren were there, and there was a purpose about their play in the
first half which brought them a goal after only 15 minutes.
Laudrup was brought down out on the left, took the free kick himself,
found Mark Hateley with a practised ease, and the striker obliged him by
sending his header beyond the Danish keeper and into the net.
Minutes later the Englishman was booked for a late tackle but that was
only an interruption in a first half in which Rangers might have scored
even more goals.
Ian Ferguson had a shot pushed for a corner and before half-time Brian
Reid twice headed over the bar -- from a corner and then a free kick --
as Laudrup twice found him in the penalty box.
Three minutes after the interval Rangers keeper Andy Goram, looking as
confident as ever, had no chance when an angled shot from Torben Hallum
flew in at the far corner.
Gascoigne then decided to take matters into his own hands. In 50
minutes he curled a 35-yard free kick against a post and two minutes
later, from 30-yards this time, he hit another free kick which defeated
the keeper.
Before he went off, he saw another shot blocked by Michael Jorgensen
in the Danish goal and the new man was so impressed that he walked over
to shake the keeper's hand.
Before the end the keeper had another save from a Hateley header, and
Rangers were never in any danger of slipping up in the way their
makeshift team had done two nights earlier in Jutland.
Gascoigne certainly dispelled any rumours which had surfaced about his
lack of fitness.
This was a man with an appetite for the game, a man who is able to
turn a match with just a flash of genius.
Afterwards he admitted that the searing heat -- the temperature had
reached 90[DEG] in Copenhagen during the day -- had affected him for the
first part of the game. But he added: ''I feel fitter after every match
I play. The first 15 minutes were difficult tonight, then I settled in.
''There were chances being made and that is something which pleases
all of us.
''I'm now looking forward to the tournament at Ibrox -- that is going
to be big for me.''
Assistant manager Archie Knox added: ''We gave Gascoigne the amount of
time he needed. He could have played the full 90 minutes but we want him
buzzing for the matches this weekend.''
RANGERS -- Goram, Cleland, Robertson, Gough, McLaren, Reid, McCall,
Gascoigne, Ferguson, Hateley, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Durrant, Steven.

'Two years ago I watched a Scottish girl being lapped in an indoor
800m. That is just money wasted.'
BOB GREENOAK
SCOTLAND, who contested their first athletics international 100 years
and one week ago today at Celtic Park, have reached the finish line. The
most powerful officials in the sport, backed by coaches, agree that full
senior team internationals should cease.
This will end head-to-head contests against other countries, but would
leave the Commonwealth Games unaffected as only competitors who achieve
a pre-ordained standard are eligible.
''I believe that the days of a full national team with athletes
turning out in all events, plus relays, are over,'' said George Duncan,
convenor of the Scottish Athletics Federation's track and field
commission yesterday.
While stressing that this is a personal view, he added: ''It is one
which is shared by many of my colleagues, and it is just a matter of
time before we put the policy into action.''
Among those who support his opinion are Bob Greenoak, secretary of the
SAF, and its president, Peter Carton. They are prepared to put the
practical proposals together, and do not believe they would require to
be laid before the federation's annual meeting. Duncan, however, thinks
that clubs should have the chance to vote on the matter.
''We have a constitutional obligation to provide competitive
opportunities, and we would still do that, with select groups of
athletes,'' said Greenoak. ''But I agree that the days of full teams are
numbered. It is a view that many senior officials have held for some
time. Two years ago I watched a Scottish girl being lapped in an indoor
800m. That is just money wasted. She should not have been there.
''Scotland is effectively committed to hosting a match against Israel,
Turkey and Wales next summer, but I forsee no other full international
matches after that.''
Instead, Scottish athletics funds will be channelled towards small
groups of competitors, sending the very best to appropriate contests at
home and abroad. This would mean perhaps five or six athletes travelling
to meetings on the Continent and as many as 40 to events like the
English Inter-counties.
''It is just not cost effective to do otherwise,'' insists Duncan.
''It costs anything between #18,000 and #25,000 to host an athletics
international for both sexes, and that is with just one athlete per
event -- a mimimum of 40 competitors. Other sports, like football, rugby
and even swimming, face nothing like such high costs. We simply cannot
afford this.''
SAF president Carton, until recently a competing member of Shettleston
Harriers, and an accountant by profession, said: ''These matches are an
anachronism. We have taken soundings from coaches, and they agree that
small, select groups are the way forward.''
Matters came to a head when the Scottish team for last weekend's
international in Cardiff, against Wales, Northern Ireland and Turkey,
fell apart. Only two out of the nine men initially selected for track
events made it to Wales, and fewer than half of the 37 male and female
athletes were those chosen originally.
''Bluntly, we gave some Scottish vests to people who did not really
merit them,'' added Duncan. ''Many of those unable to attend could not
afford to take time off work. In the current employment climate, we
cannot blame them. But in development terms it was a waste of resources.
We did not have a 5000m runner at all, because we could not find anyone
good enough to represent their country.
''I am patriotic and regret the need to do this, but we have not got
the money to do otherwise. No full team gives value for money.''
Greenoak, however, lays some of the blame at the door of leading
athletes, whom he declined to name, but who, he said, only turn out at
Commonwealth Games, then regularly reject selection for other
internationals.
Two of Scotland's greatest athletics sons, from eras more than half a
century apart, were saddened by the demise of the Scottish team.
The 1980 Olympic 100 metres champion, Allan Wells, whose formative
athletics years were in an era when such matches were still commonplace,
said: ''This would not have happened in my day, because then there was a
decent depth of ability in Scotland. Scottish athletics is in a pretty
miserable state now, and the best want to pick and chose where they
compete. It is sad that the overall level is not healthy enough for them
to want to be involved.
''But they must provide opportunities for younger people, and give a
lot of thought about who they spend that money on. A lot of people just
want the team blazer, they go for the trip and are never seen again.
They never make the transition to British level. They should pick
youngsters who are committed and focused.''
Lieutenant Colonel Tom Riddell, winner of eight Scottish mile titles
in the 1920s and '30s, who maintains a keen interest in the sport in his
91st year, said last night: ''There was never any problem getting the
winner and runner-up from the Scottish championships to turn out for
their country in my day.''
Riddell, a contemporary of Eric Liddell, competed some 25 times for
Scotland. He added: ''There were three of these team matches every year
-- I think it is a tragedy that they are to finish.''
The SAF has received a special increase of #30,000 from the Scottish
Sports Council to cater for the needs of leading competitors, but the
Government, unlike other countries, puts nothing towards funding elite
competitors.

A REPORT into allegations of financial irregularity in a number of
community projects in Glasgow's Easterhouse area has been referred to
the police.
This was disclosed yesterday by Glasgow's Town Clerk, Mr Tom Monaghan,
who will himself be carrying out a full investigation over the next few
weeks, after which he will submit a report to Glasgow District Council.
The allegations focus on Mrs Gail McCann, who earlier this year was
elected as the member for Queenslie on Glasgow City Council which
assumes power next April.
Deputy leader of the ruling Labour Group at the City Chambers, Bailie
Gordon Macdiarmid, has confirmed that, for the past five months, the
existing Glasgow District Council has been carrying out an internal
audit into allegations regarding Mrs McCann and her involvement in a
number of community groups grant-funded by the council.
The groups involved are believed to include Cranhill Community
Council, which Mrs McCann chairs, Greater Easterhouse Health Project, of
which she is project co-ordinator, and Greater Easterhouse Theatre
Project, which she is involved in managing.
One of the allegations is understood to involve the payment of more
than #900 to her husband for redecorating premises used by the health
project a few weeks after the same building was decorated by another
firm for #1630.
Mr Tom Monaghan said: ''I have received from the director of finance
an interim report in respect of allegations made regarding a number of
projects in the Easterhouse area.
''A copy of the report has been sent to the police.''

HEARTS chairman Chris Robinson spoke to Jim Jefferies for three hours
last night going over details about the vacant job of manager at
Tynecastle, and the position is expected to be filled today, writes Ray
Hepburn.
The two men met after Falkirk chairman George Fulston gave Robinson
permission to deliver his best sales pitch -- and Jefferies will digest
everything he has heard over the past few days before deciding -- as now
seems certain -- to return to the club he served as a player for 15
years.
''I'm grateful to the chairman for giving me the opportunity to hear
what Hearts have to say,'' commented Jefferies. ''I have no desire to
leave Falkirk, but Hearts are a big club with great potential and I feel
I want to listen to them.
''I'll have a long think about the situation and come to a final
decision some time tomorrow.''
But one condition set down before Robinson last night was a guarantee
of a position for Jefferies' assistant manager, Billy Brown. They will
go as a pair or not at all.
That will involve even more compensation for Falkirk. The duo's
contracts are up in December and Falkirk will want around #70,000 for
the loss of their management team.
Meanwhile, Robinson last night re-signed striker Kevin Thomas on a new
two-year contract, and winger John Colquhoun for a further year.

Bloodied, bewildered, and bedraggled, the first refugees from Zepa
arrived in Sarejevo yesterday. Kurt Schork heard their harrowing stories
THE full horror of the fall of Zepa was revealed yesterday by a
handful of the hundreds of terrified refugees who fled the ramaging
Bosnian Serb army.
The first 151 refugees from the UN-designated ''safe area'' of Zepa,
35 of them needing urgent hospital treatment, arrived in Sarajevo by bus
and truck early yesterday.
Teeth gritted, their stumps wrapped in rags, the wounded emerged in
Sarajevo as the first light of dawn broke.
Some of those who emerged from the vehicles into the swirl of lights
and diesel fumes were able to walk. Others had to be lifted gently and
placed on stretchers.
There were men of fighting age, young boys, and old women dressed in
the head scarves and patterned skirts of Bosnian mountain folk.
One elderly woman, the stump of her leg wrapped in a blood-soaked rag,
moaned incoherently as she was carried by stretcher into the trauma
clinic.
The flood of wounded soon overwhelmed that facility so some patients
were screened on stretchers at the entrance and diverted to other areas
of the hospital.
About 17,000 Bosnian Muslims are believed to have fled the town into
the surrounding mountains and forests to escape the Serbs. Many of them
are refugees from other areas overrun by the Serbs.
Hundreds of refugees arrived in Sarajevo later. The few men who did
arrive were in their late 50s or older. The refugees said the Serbs
taunted them with jeers like: ''Where are your leaders, now you need
help?''
''The centre of Zepa has been completely destroyed,'' said Benjamin
Kulovac, a doctor from Zepa. ''The offensive lasted for 14 days. On the
12th day, the centre of the town was in danger so the people and army
fled into the woods.''
Kulovac helped negotiate the medical evacuation. He said Zepa's other
doctor had stayed behind to tend more wounded in the woods surrounding
the town.
One of the wounded was a 67-year-old woman. Her left leg was amputated
below the knee and crudely bandaged in a piece of cloth. A young child
with leg wounds was carried on a stretcher into the hospital.
''There were more shells than rain,'' said one of the handful of men.
He was wounded in the arm.
''It was horrible,'' said another woman, who looked about 65 years
old. ''There was shelling for 12 days. We're exhausted and we're
hungry.''
Reports from the first evacuees paint a picture of the enclave's
defenders being overwhelmed by Serb heavy weapons after their lines
collapsed south of Zepa town on Monday.
''It was impossible to stop them, the tanks were ploughing the ground
with their shells,'' said 35-year old Salem Cesko.
Bosnian Serb buses with UN escorts on board have so far evacuated
about 1400 refugees across front lines to the government-held town of
Kladanj, UN officials said.
''We will push very hard for as much escort and access to these
convoys as possible,'' said Chris Gunness, a UN spokesman in Zagreb.
''We obviously want to avoid a situation in which atrocities are
committed as they clearly were in Srebrenica. The Serb army has shown
itself perfectly capable of callously disregarding international
humanitarian law,'' he said.
UN peacekeepers were compiling passenger lists of all the refugees
which would be checked on arrival.
Separatist Serb forces rolled into Zepa on Tuesday exactly two weeks
after they seized control of neighbouring Srebrenica.
Muslim refugees herded out of Srebrenica described awful scenes of
women being dragged off buses and raped and men taken away from their
families for execution.
Dutch UN peacekeepers in Srebrenica, powerless to act, said they saw
Serb soldiers execute and mutilate Muslims.
Fears are also growing for the safety of around 180,000 people who
have been trapped in the Bihac pocket in north-west Bosnia for most of
the 39-month war.
Major Myriam Souchaki, a UN spokeswoman in Sarajevo, said Serb forces
shelled the town of Coralici and launched an offensive south of Pecigrad
early yesterday.
Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,
said up to 8000 people in the enclave were fleeing an offensive which
began a week ago.
''At least 8000 are on the run. What we may see is the population of
Bihac (enclave) squeezed into this little town in the south, which is a
humanitarian disaster in the making.''
Croatian Serbs and their Serb allies in Bosnia launched a co-ordinated
assault to the north and west of the enclave with the help of troops
loyal to rebel Muslim leader Fikret Abdic.
Government sources and UN officials say the Serb objective is to cut
the Bihac pocket in half around Coralici, instal Abdic as a puppet ruler
there, and drive south to attack Bihac town.
Colonel Jesper Helsoe, commander of 1350 UN peacekeepers based in
Coralici, said the Serbs assaulted two prominent hills just north-west
of the Coralici road junction yesterday morning.
The attack abated around midday and it was not immediately clear if
the Serbs had gained more ground.
Serb artillery also pounded the area near the Bosnian army's airfield
in Coralici on Tuesday night after the first nocturnal supply plane from
Croatia for weeks was spotted approaching, Helsoe said.
''There was heavy artillery fire towards the air strip to knock out
the plane but it left a half hour later untouched.''
Daring resupply flights over Serb-held territory from Croatia's
Adriatic coast have helped sustain Bihac for three years under Serb
encirclement, far from government-held central Bosnia.
UN sources said the arms airlift stopped in early June after a
helicopter carrying the Bosnian foreign minister from Zagreb to Bihac
for a visit was shot down over Krajina Serb territory. He was killed.
A Medecins San Frontieres nurse wept yesterday as she told a meeting
of leading humanitarian groups in Brussels of conditions in the
so-called safe areas.
Christina Schmitz, who returned from Srebrenica last week after
helping to evacuate the last 15 civilians there, told of the horrors she
had seen.
At one stage, she said, there was shelling every minute and the
hospital where she worked ''was like a bloodbath''.
''The most horrific thing was the shelling from all sides and people
trying to escape from the bombs,'' said Schmitz.
Men were separated from their families. One father who was taken away
by Serb soldiers handed over his child to the German nurse, asking her
to look after him as his wife had been killed. ''I know he will never
see that baby again,'' said Schmitz.
Jacques de Milliano, head of MSF Holland, said thousands were missing
from Srebrenica after it fell to Serb forces.
''How can we protect the other 'safe areas'? We are calling on the
international community to answer this question,'' he said.

LABOUR'S plans for devolution south of the Border have been attacked
by one of its leading spokesmen.
Sir Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities, wrote to senior party figures, including leader Tony Blair,
earlier this month, strongly criticising the plans to water down the
powers of regional assemblies in England.
Sir Jeremy, felt by many to be the most senior Labour figure in local
government, said: ''I have to say that the present proposals are likely
to cause a storm of protest in the party, and indeed beyond, in a number
of regions.
''It may be true, as the leader remarked, that support for regionalism
is strongest among the afficionados. But then a radical party, to some
degree at least, seeks to set an agenda and not merely respond to an
existing agenda or someone else's agenda.''
A week after the letter was sent, Labour announced it was reining back
on proposals for elected assemblies in England, and Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson was forced on to the defensive, making clear
that the policy change would have no effect on the plans for Scottish
devolution.
Sir Jeremy's letter, a copy of which has been obtained by The Herald,
is addressed to Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw, with copies to Mr
Blair, deputy leader John Prescott, and other senior figures.
He refers to a discussion on regional policy and says he wishes to
''amplify my concerns about the content of the kind of devolution which
is being proposed''. He argues that on a range of policies -- bids for
European funds, transport, and planning -- not enough power is being
devolved to local level.
Referring to the meeting, he said: ''Perhaps the most telling
observation of the afternoon was when you indicated that, on the basis
of my approach, Labour Ministers might have to say to regions, 'We would
like to carry out policy in your region but we have to deal with a
regional assembly which of course may be Tory.'
''This really goes to the heart of the matter. How much power is to
remain in Whitehall and its regional outposts and how much is to be
exercised in the regions and by the regions? It is here that in my view
the paper falls far short of the hopes of many of us who have campaigned
for over 20 years for a measure of regional government conducted on
accountable lines.
''Unless there is something real to aim for in terms of regional
decision-making, popular support may indeed fail to be forthcoming.''
Labour's spokesman on constitutional reform, Pontypridd MP Dr Kim
Howells, said: ''The idea that we would impose frontiers or some sort of
system like the German Lander is nonsense.''
A spokesman for Conservative Central Office said: ''This simply
demonstrates yet more disarray and confusion in yet another area of
Labour policy.''

BRITISH athlete Diane Modahl is in the running for millions of pounds
of compensation after winning her appeal against a four-year ban for
allegedly taking drugs.
She declared herself ''thrilled and delighted'' after the finding in
her favour after a two-day hearing.
The panel of three overturned the verdict imposed last December by a
British Athletic Federation disciplinary committee, which ruled that
Modahl was guilty of committing a doping offence.
She had tested positive at an event in Lisbon in June 1994. Her urine
sample was said to contain massive levels of the male hormone
testosterone. She was sent home from the Commonwealth Games in Victoria,
Canada, barred from defending her title.
Modahl, who is expecting a baby in October, revealed at a news
conference in London last night that ''new'' evidence submitted was not
in fact new. She said: ''It was mentioned at the original hearing that
my sample had deteriorated and that material changes had taken place.
''That was not believed in December. This time, the panel understood
that was a fact.''
She funded the #200,000 cost of her appeal from the advance which she
received for a book. If the International Amateur Athletic Federation
fail to overturn the verdict at arbitration, Modahl stands to receive
substantial damages. The media worldwide branded her a cheat on the
strength of the original verdict.
The appeal panel said it could ''not be sure beyond a reasonable doubt
of Mrs Modahl's guilt.
''There is a possibility which cannot be ignored . . . not that
testosterone had been administered but that the samples had become
degraded owing to their being stored in unrefrigerated conditions and
that bacteriological action had resulted in an increase in the amount of
testosterone in the samples.
''Mrs Modahl is therefore entitled to succeed in her appeal.''

MALAYSIA'S Cabinet yesterday supported the Muslim world's plan to defy
the United Nations arms embargo on Bosnia.
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has joined the Organisation
of Islamic Conference (OIC) in declaring the ban on arm sales to Bosnia
invalid.
''The Cabinet agreed with the decision,'' the national news agency
quoted Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi as saying after the Cabinet
meeting.
He said a committee of foreign policy and defence officials would meet
to decide how to proceed with the OIC's plan.
Abdullah said the committee, which will meet today, would also try to
find ways to overcome the UN's opposition to Malaysia doubling its
peacekeepers in Bosnia to 3000 and providing them with more firepower.
Mahathir has said Malaysia was willing to face economic sanctions as
the price for providing military aid to Bosnia's Muslims.
''We are forced to face it because these people (the world powers)
talk about human rights and as far as they are concerned, their right
are just to help the Serbs kill the Bosnians,'' Mahathir said.
In Sofia, there was a warning that the escalation of fighting
threatened the stability of the Balkan region.
''The conflict has entered a phase when it threatens destructive
consequences for our region and Europe as a whole,'' said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov in a statement.
Though a Slavic country like Serbia with an Eastern Orthodox religion,
Bulgaria has remained strictly neutral during the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia.
But in a sign of possible contention, there was a suggestion yesterday
that Bulgaria should change its description of land on the Serbian side
of theshared border inhabited partly by ethnic Bulgarians.

VOTERS go to the polls in Littleborough and Saddleworth today in one
of the most fiercely fought and acrimonious by-elections of recent
years.
The contest in the seat held by the Conservatives with a majority of
just 4494 is being seen as not only a test of popularity for Prime
Minister John Major and his reshuffled Government but of the
electability of Mr Tony Blair's ''new'' Labour Party.
The insults continued to fly between the parties yesterday as they
made their final efforts to woo the electorate in the Pennine
constituency left vacant by the death of flamboyant MP Geoffrey Dickens.
The campaign has been marked by bitter attacks on each other's past
records by Liberal Democrat Chris Davies, a 41-year-old fell runner, and
Labour's Phil Woolas, 35.
Mr Woolas has been accused in his role as communications officer for
the GMB union, of opposing Labour's Clause 4 reforms and of supporting
NUM leader Arthur Scargill.
Labour, in turn, have taken Mr Davies to task for his alleged
contribution to a conference debate on the legalisation of cannabis and
reported remarks on the need for ''hefty'' tax rises.
The Conservatives claim their candidate, Mr John Hudson, Mr Dickens'
former agent, has scored with the voters by remaining aloof from the
mud-slinging and concentrating on the issues and can still come through
the middle to win.
However, as campaigning reached a crescendo yesterday, even the Tories
were drawn into the war of words.
A barnstorming performance at a Tuesday night rally by Mr Michael
Heseltine, in which he condemned the ''gutter'' tactics of the other two
parties, was attacked by Labour's campaign manager, MP Peter Mandelson.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown joined in the last-minute
campaigning yesterday but would not be drawn into the ''dirty tricks''
row.
''If I have any comments to make about the nature of the campaign I
will make them after the ballot tomorrow,'' he said.
Bookmakers William Hill make the Liberal Democrats, in second place
last time, 1-5 favourites to take the seat. Labour are quoted at 3-1,
with the Conservatives 50-1 outsiders.
Mr Ashdown said all their evidence was that undecided voters were
coming to them as the way to beat the Conservatives and defeat would
reduce the Government's Commons majority to single figures for the first
time in 16 years.
The candidates are: John Hudson (Conservative), Chris Davies (Liberal
Dem--ocrat), Phil Woolas (Labour), Mr Blobby (House Party), Peter
Douglas (Conversative Party), Lawson McLaren (Old Labour/Probity of
Imposed Candidate), Colin Palmer, Lord of Manton (Twenty-first Century
Party), Andrew Pitts (Socialist Party), Lord David Sutch (Official
Monster Raving Loony Party), John Whittaker (UK Independence Party).

THE United States and Russia were last night on collision course over
the arms embargo in Bosnia.
As the Senate voted overwhelmingly to lift the arms embargo, a senior
Russian foreign affairs expert warned that the Russians would consider
doing the same for the Serbs.
''Some of the leading Russian parliamentarians (and not the most
militant ones) have already been talking today and yesterday about the
possibility of a unilateral repeal of an embargo against Belgrade,''
Professor Sergei Karaganov, deputy director of the Institute of Europe,
told Channel Four news.
Karaganov, who spoke before the Senate vote, said Nato bombings would
not solve the problem.
''The international community has already lost the war there.'' The
62-29 vote in the Senate is seen as a direct slap at the Clinton
administration's foreign policy.
The vote took place in an emotionally charged atmosphere, with
senators reading news reports of fresh Bosnian Serb atrocities against
Bosnian Muslims.
They maintained that a Clinton administration promise of stepped-up
air strikes was being thwarted by a timid United Nations.
The margin was enough to override a promised presidential veto.
At the White House, press secretary Mike McCurry said Congress would
bear the responsibility for a ''dreadful decision'' if the resolution
became law.
Senate majority leader Bob Dole said: ''It's about whether some small
country that's been ravaged on all sides, pillaged, women raped,
children killed, has any rights in this world.''
The Senate vote could make diplomacy with US allies over Bosnia more
difficult, the White House said.
However, President Clinton said he remained hopeful that legislators
would work with him to resolve the disagreement.
''I do not believe the strong course for the United States and the
strong course for the people of Bosnia is unilaterally to lift the arms
embargo, collapse the UN mission, and increase the chances of injecting
Americans troops there,'' Clinton said.
Russia had signalled earlier that it would work only towards a
political resolution of the Bosnian crisis, further complicating
attempts by the big powers to reach consensus on how to end the 39-month
war.
Russia said it won agreement from the Bosnian Serbs not to attack the
UN ''safe area'' of Gorazde. A foreign ministry official said the pledge
was made during a visit by Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev to
Belgrade on Monday and Tuesday.
The emphasis put by Yeltsin on a peaceful settlement again exposed the
differences in approach between Russia on the one side and the US,
Britain, and France on the other.
The Western powers have threatened Bosnian Serbs with further Nato air
strikes if they attack Gorazde.
Russia is opposed to such military action, saying not all political
options have yet been exhausted. Until now, it has pinned its hopes on
using its traditional leverage on Serbia to influence the actions of
Bosnian Serbs.
The Kremlin disclosed yesterday that Kozyrev had met not only Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade but also Bosnian Serb General
Ratko Mladic, military architect of the Serbs' conquest of the UN
''safe'' areas of Srebrenica and Zepa.
Together with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and 22 other
Bosnian Serbs, Mladic was charged on Tuesday with genocide, war crimes,
and crimes against humanity by the UN criminal tribunal for former
Yugoslavia based in The Hague.
The Kremlin's brief announcement of yesterday's meetings, at a
sanatorium near Moscow where Yeltsin is recovering from a mild heart
attack, gave no details of Kozyrev's talks in Belgrade.
In comments in Belgrade on Tuesday, Mr Kozyrev said Russia and Serbia
were committed to the view that the Bosnian war could be resolved only
by peaceful means.
The United Nations last night gave UN military commanders in Bosnia
the authority to call for air strikes without civilian approval.
UN spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said Boutros-Ghali would relinquish his
decision-making power on air strikes to French General Bernard Janvier,
head of the UN Protection Force in Bosnia. Janvier could delegate that
power to commanders in Bosnia in case close air support was needed to
defend UN troops.

In Brussels
THE EUROPEAN Union and the United States should bury their differences
over trade, Bosnia, and Nato and examine new ways of cementing political
and economic links with a free-trade area to be known as the
Transatlantic Economic Space, the European Commission suggested
yesterday.
Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioner for transatlantic relations,
announced the launch of a strategy paper which is intended to lay the
groundwork for a deepening of links into the next century.
Sir Leon told reporters: ''The close relationship between Western
Europe and America has guaranteed peace, stability, and prosperity ever
since the Second World War. It has stood the whole world in good stead.
Indeed, it has been the most important such relationship in the world.
''I believe it is essential and entirely feasible for it to remain so.
But circumstances have changed and we need to look again at all aspects
of the relationship if we are to strengthen it and modernise it.''
EU officials have expressed concern in private in recent times at an
apparent distancing of the two blocs after a series of public trade
disputes and, latterly, Bosnia and America's commitment to Nato. These
fears have not been calmed by the perception in Europe that America has
moved towards a more isolationist stance.
Sir Leon said these doubts and disagreements had led some people to
think they detected a rift in the EU-US relationship. ''This fear is
exaggerated,'' he said, ''and should be seen in perspective. For the
most part, co-operation in political, economic, and security matters
works well.''
He said, however, the relationship would remain as robust in the
future only if both partners adapted to changing priorities.
''This means finding mechanisms for settling problems where our
interests do not always coincide, as well as those where they do. It
means tying the transatlantic relationship in as we draw up plans for
further European integration, so that they complement each other,'' he
said.
Sir Leon said concrete decisions were expected this year at the Madrid
summit of EU leaders. The Commission's strategy paper now goes to the EU
Council of Ministers which has six months to come up with
recommendations for the Madrid meeting, when it is expected the
Americans will be present.
The Transatlantic Economic Space is a distant target and one which has
long been suggested by politicians both in the EU and America. It would,
in effect, be a free trade zone rather like the European single market.
EU Ministers will study the feasibility of the proposed TES along with
security developments, humanitarian aid, joint action to combat drugs,
international crime, asylum, and immigration.
The TES could be achieved, the Commission believes, by using a
''building block'' approach. This would involve boosting work already
under way in certain areas while considering possible new sectors.

Duncan Black reports on a Glasgow campaign to save Bosnians
FORMER Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart joined forces with MPs
from opposition parties yesterday to back a campaign to allow the
Bosnians to defend themselves.
The lifting of the arms embargo is the principal aim of the Save the
Bosnian People campaign which has been launched by a group of Glasgow
business people. They are confident of support from all walks of life
and all over the UK for their efforts which will include fund-raising to
provide humanitarian aid for refugees.
Planned events include an emergency conference in Glasgow next month
to which international figures such as former Prime Minister Lady
Thatcher, ex-Labour leader Michael Foot, and Liberal Democrat leader
Paddy Ashdown will be invited.
The campaigners are demanding the urgent recall of Parliament from its
summer recess and decisive action by the Government to defend Bosnia.
Mr Stewart yesterday joined Labour MP George Galloway and SNP MP
Roseanna Cunningham to help organisers launch the campaign at a news
conference in the City Chambers.
The Tory MP for Eastwood said the campaign was part of a worldwide
movement demanding a radically different approach to the Bosnian crisis.
He said: ''It is absolutely clear that the United Nations is not
protecting the civilian population. It is absurd to deny the people of
Bosnia, particularly the Muslims, the right of self defence.''
Mr Stewart said the lifting of the arms embargo would represent a
major change in UN policy and it would be appropriate for Parliament to
be recalled to consider that. The matter could be dealt with in a
one-day debate.
Mr Galloway, MP for Hillhead, said the campaign had met a specific
moment in the history of the conflict. Just as television pictures of
the Ethiopian famine had created a critical mass of global concern and
produced decisive action, the harrowing images after the fall of
Srebrenica had created a worldwide concern about the Bosnian crisis.
Suddenly the ''empty, meaningless, hollow rhetoric'' of international
leaders had been exposed as the sham that it was, he said.
''It is a crime against the Bosnian people to deny them the right to
arm themselves. I believe this campaign to be part of an international
wave that will sweep around the world and will be successful.''
Ms Cunningham, MP for Perth and Kinross, said: ''Either we now commit
ourselves and our forces to protecting properly the people of
Bosnia-Herzegovina or the arms embargo must be lifted. Nobody wants a
killing field, but that is what we have got right now. We have an
unequal killing field. If the best we can do is level the killing field,
that would be better than what is being done at the moment.''
Mohammed Sarwar, campaign member and a Glasgow district councillor,
said: ''While genuinely respectful of the brave British soldiers in the
front line, the campaign regards them as lions led by ineffective and
indecisive British, European, and international leaders.''
Councillor Sarwar also read out a message of support from the Western
Isles Labour MP, Mr Calum Macdonald.
Glasgow businessman Tarak Ramzan, one of the campaign founders, said:
''Throughout this horror, our political leaders have repeatedly
reassured us that the UN would bring about an acceptable end to this
genocide. In our name, our political masters have committed a cruel
deception on the Bosnian people.''
Another campaign member, Mr Shokat Mobarik, said: ''The British
Government is out of step with public opinion on the Bosnian issue. The
British public know you cannot have a policy of appeasement to wanton
aggression.''
Organisers say the campaign is already receiving all kinds of support
including the provision of offices and computers.
* The president of the Scottish charity Blythswood, the Rev Jackie
Ross, is preparing to launch an appeal to send aid in the charity's own
fleet of articulated vehicles to Bosnian refugees in Slovenia.
