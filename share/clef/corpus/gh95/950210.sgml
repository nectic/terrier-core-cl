THE Prime Minister's attempts to scare English electors away from
constitutional change by decrying regional assemblies as ''teenage
madness'' appears to have left them unruffled, according to an exclusive
poll by The Herald/System Three.
The poll of almost 1600 voters, in 145 constituencies south of the
Border, shows that the constitutional debate does not appear to have
reached critical mass there, and while there may be widespread apathy on
the notion of regional assemblies, there is no sign of fear of them.
There are also clear indications that very few English voters see the
issue as the kind of priority which would make them switch party. As a
result, it appears to be neither a vote-winner nor vote-loser. The poll
did not include Wales because nationalist support there would have
clouded the devolution issue.
The key question of how English electors would vote in a referendum on
devolution, involving setting up regional assemblies in England as well
as in Wales and Scotland, showed that even before a real debate has
started it could be a close contest.
There was a vote of 39% against such a UK-wide system, with 35% in
favour. Mr Major's onslaught may have stiffened resolve in his own party
in the South (Tory voters rejected the system by 60% to 24%), but he
appears to have failed to persuade Labour voters that Tony Blair's
proposals are a bad idea.
Labour voters in England support devolved British government by a
clear margin of 43% to 33%. Perhaps surprisingly, given the party's
federalist credentials, supporters of the Liberal Democrats backed the
scheme by just 38% to 37%.
The high overall number saying they did not know how they would vote,
25%, indicates that the argument could be there for the winning, if the
debate does take off.
Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, said of the results last night:
''This poll shows that most people in England who have thought about the
issue are against Labour's plans to break up Britain. They should think
again now.''
Mr Kim Howells, Labour's front-bench spokesman on the constitution,
said: ''To me this indicates that there is a desire throughout the
country for decentralised government, but it is clear people don't have
a clear picture in their minds yet of how this would work, so we have a
lot of explaining to do.
''The initial results are very encouraging from a Labour point of
view, given that we haven't really begun the argument yet. These figures
indicate that John Major has failed, except in the case of his party
diehards, to stir up fears about the supposedly dire consequences of our
policy.''
Another surprise in the poll for the Liberal Democrats was that their
supporters in their South-west heartland rejected the scheme. Mr Paul
Tyler, the MP for North Cornwall, said this was because support varied
across smaller areas than used in the survey.
He said that, in the past, big local authorities had been seen to take
power away from localities, rather than pull back power from Whitehall,
and there was clearly work to be done to win people over. ''I don't
think the debate has really got off the ground yet in England,'' he
said.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said the poll that showed there was no
hostility among the English electorate towards Scotland's national
aspirations and that John Major's attempt to stir up middle England
against Scotland was doomed.
He added: ''It also highlights the folly of Labour's approach in
mixing up the national case for a Scottish Parliament with the regional
case for English assemblies. There is clearly no groundswell of opinion
in favour of such an unnecessary fudge.''
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, said that there
were ''some comforting elements in the poll'', from the point of view of
Labour support. But he pointed out that the creation of the Scottish
Parliament and Welsh Assembly was not conditional on the setting up of
English regional assemblies, making the question an artificial one.
Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, a Social Security Minister in the Lords
and a former Scottish Minister, who is speaking on devolution in
Newcastle tonight, said of the poll: ''It shows that a majority of
people who have focused on the issue are against regional assemblies.
Many people regard Labour's plans as an irrelevance.''
* Apart from Lord MacKay's speech in Newcastle, Mr Allan Stewart, who
resigned as a Scottish Office Minister this week, is speaking tonight in
Tony Blair's Sedgefield constituency.
Our poll shows that the North-east of England is one of the areas
where support for devolution is strongest and understanding of the issue
is greatest. The Campaign for a Northern Assembly, which models itself
on its Scottish counterpart, has written to Mr Stewart to challenge his
opposition to devolution.

FORMER Hawick flanker Grant Harris, who was banned from rugby union
for life after having signed professional forms with the Carlisle rugby
league side, is seeking reinstatement to the amateur ranks.
The 27-year-old joined the Guildford Park club in January, 1992, after
having been dropped from by Hawick. He maintains that he received only
travelling expenses and a meal allowance during his two years with
Carlisle, and that he had never been paid a wage or playing bonuses.
Harris now is a fireman in Hawick and is desperate to re-enlist with
his old junior club, Hawick YM. His case now is before the Scottish
Rugby Union and is due to be discussed at the general committee meeting
today.
''I just want to play social rugby,'' he said. ''I have written to SRU
chief executive Bill Hogg and have been interviewed by the South of
Scotland SRU representatives, Bert Duffy and Derek Brown. I got a fair
hearing, but the matter has to go to the International Board.''
Harris was one of three Hawick players recruited by Carlisle at the
beginning of 1992. Colin Paxton, a cousin of injured Scotland scrum half
Gary Armstrong, and Derek Armstrong also made the leap across the great
divide which still separates the two rugby codes.
''I was approached by Carlisle and played a trial game for them. It
was Colin Paxton's first game and the TV cameras were there. I scored
four tries and a couple of them were shown on Border TV.
''I got a letter from the SRU banning me for a year. I thought well,
I've been banned for a year, what can I do? I reckoned the best thing to
do was sign for Carlisle. Then I got the letter banning me for life,''
Harris said.
The player, who made six first-team appearances on the wing for the
English side, before playing for their Alliance side, suffered a severe
ankle injury 12 months ago and had not played since.
''I didn't earn a thing during my time at Carlisle,'' he claimed. ''In
fact, it cost me money. I ruined my car travelling up and down from
Hawick. I sent off statements of accounts to the SRU showing that I
hadn't made any money. So, even though I signed professional forms, I
don't consider myself to have been a professional in the sense that I
never earned a penny from the game.''
Reinstatement to the amateur ranks can only be sanctioned by the
International Board, which would be guided by the recommendation of the
home union.
The outcome of the Harris case will depend upon his assertion that he
made no money from his time with Carlisle.
Yesterday, SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said: ''Derek Brown and Bert
Duffy will submit a report to the committee meeting tomorrow. Depending
on the outcome of that report, we will then make a recommendation to the
International Board, to be discussed at their annual general meeting
next month.''

Your report on future mental health services for south Glasgow
(February 2) draws some premature conclusions. The trust has, over
recent months, been discussing internally the development of proposals
for future mental health services in the south of the city. These
discussions are very much at a preliminary stage, although there is a
strong aspiration to develop a model of care for south Glasgow based on
the development of an extensive community infrastructure and the
development of in-patient services for the south-east of Glasgow in that
part of the city. This model would be similar in design to that which is
very successfully being put in place currently in the east and north of
the city.
The proposals which are beginning to emerge internally within the
trust are consistent with Greater Glasgow Health Board's published
mental health strategy. The reason detailed proposals for the south of
Glasgow do not form part of the recently published Greater Glasgow Joint
Community Care Plan is that detailed proposals have not yet been
formulated.
The Joint Community Care Plan does, however, clearly state that:
''Development of a strategy for the south and west of Glasgow is
currently being discussed, and this will provide the basis for a
programme of hospital reduction and investment in new health and social
care community services.''
As my reported letter to the health board clearly indicated, the trust
has an absolute commitment to bring forward clearly developed proposals
for south Glasgow for discussion with our partners in the joint planning
process. We have always assumed that firm proposals would also require
full public consultation. In the light of this, the article in The
Herald is entirely speculative. The trust will bring forward proposals
which will include consideration of the future of the Leverndale site,
given that the larger part of the site is already empty and subject to
increasing vandalism and cost. A full debate of the issues would be more
appropriate when firm proposals have been agreed and published for
public consultation.

I have followed with interest the correspondence in these columns
about the Clyde Festival Gardens project. I have found myself strongly
attracted to the concept of an exciting, imaginative project on this
unique site.
Critics of the proposal have argued that the festival gardens project
is not financially viable without substantial public funds. I
understand, however, that Glasgow Chamber of Commerce does believe that
such a scheme could be viable. Moreover, the promoters' financial and
property advisers attest to its viability, their track record including
schemes such as Princes Square, Parkhead Forge, and other ambitious
projects which critics said could never be economically viable.
I have no doubt that Glasgow's commercial future requires appropriate
business park space, but I would have to question whether it is sensible
to locate such accommodation on a site which might otherwise be used as
a major tourist attraction to Glasgow. Amid all the claim and
counterclaim, I have not been able to ascertain whether all the
possibilities for the site have been fully investigated. Glasgow has
suffered enough missed opportunities without adding to the list.
This is not, and must not be, a partisan issue. It should appeal to
all those who feel that Glasgow's great maritime shipbuilding heritage
should be given proper recognition and at the same time form part of a
permanent public entertainment space like the garden festival. If I
understand the festival gardens project properly, it would give Glasgow
an outstanding tourist attraction that is vitally needed if future
generations of tourist are to be attracted to our great city.
In that spirit, and as a token of support, I am responding to Mr
Geoffrey Jarvis's letter by contributing that symbolic #1 to help
finance the planning application which is being made for the Clyde
Festival Gardens project.

A fortnight or so ago I wrote to the Labour Shadow Defence Secretary,
Dr David Clark.
This followed the deluge of devolution details given by Labour. But,
as defence was not featured, I was querying that party's stance on the
Scottish infantry regiments.
The two other opposition parties, particularly the SNP, had stated
their intention to re-form the amalgamated regiments (The Queen's Own
Highlanders and the Gordon Highlanders) as individual regiments should
the opportunity arise. Only the Labour Party had not declared its
position on that issue. That it is an important matter -- and one
affecting votes -- cannot be questioned. A series of polls carried out
from Galashiels to Inverness, involving more than 30,000 persons at
random (of all parties) gave consistent returns of 97% support for the
retention of the individual Scottish regiments.
Although I have yet to receive an answer or acknowledgement from Dr
Clark to my letter of January 14, an item on the Grampian TV lunchtime
newscast on January 23 may be connected.
It was reported that John Home Robertson, a long-standing member of
the cross-party Defence Select Committee, had challenged Alex Salmond to
state how he would fulfil his pledge to re-form the Gordon Highlanders.
(I would imagine with rather less difficulty than renationalising a
privatised industry, or the reverse.)

Your report on the ''truancy tables'' and the reaction of the teaching
unions was sadly predictable as well as being ambivalent in attitude
towards the messages and the lessons to be learned from the information
(January 31).
Children who do attend school, their parents and teachers whose
efforts are consistently and insolently rejected by persistent truants
must have been dismayed by your caution that the facts of themselves
cannot be relied on in judgment of the situation, but I cannot imagine
that parents of children at schools either at the top or the bottom of
this ''league table for truancy'' would share that view.
Those who regularly truant often as a demonstration of their ability
to abuse and challenge the system, do so with impunity and their
confidence is boosted by the certainty of there being no effective
sanction. Furthermore the signals sent out by journalists and by the
trendies in the teaching unions provide them with a cover from the
treatment which they really deserve.
Habitual truants include in their numbers a hard core of pupils whose
attitudes must be challenged and effectively dealt with outwith the
school system and the media and the teaching unions should support the
rights of teachers and parents, not forgetting conforming school
children, who do make an effort (notwithstanding personal and family
difficulties at times) who are crying out for support on the matter of
discipline, who need support when children are being bullied by the neds
who walk all over the education system at the present time.
Teachers are not trained social workers and although there are many
with experience (who may, for example, also be parents) and who do a
remarkably good job at ''fire-fighting'' the worst problems, they are
with few exceptions ill-equipped to achieve solutions within the school
environment. Those who make life miserable for others and soak up the
valuable efforts of teachers, which would be better expended on those
children who genuinely wish to learn, should be rooted out of the
general education system and dealt with by more special education units
and by social workers.
Teachers in the Lothians have to work under a non-exclusion policy
(except in the most serious circumstances) which determines that ''all
pupils are entitled to a mainstream education'' and this is clearly
intended to include the minority who hold the system in such contempt.
This is a slap in the face for those children and parents who conform
and to teachers who are battling to cope with disinterested, abusive
children.
All my teacher relations and friends -- ranging from the headmaster to
nursery schools teacher -- agree with the contrary view that the
majority of children are entitled to the best education a teacher can
deliver, in circumstances where this is not deliberately threatened and
disrupted by the minority.
The situation in our classrooms today is a classic example of the
tyranny of a minority view which the education establishment in Scotland
is either unable or unwilling to challenge.
We must turn back the tide of hypocrisy, frustration, and despair
which threatens to engulf the teaching profession today.

The item on Tomintoul Enterprises Ltd (January 25) must surely raise
the question of the level in remuneration about to be distributed to the
receiver (#275,000 of #325,000 or 84%). At the same time the creditors
will receive an initial 20%.
Why in light of the amount of legal and accountancy effort this case
has attracted and no doubt paid for, was a precedent not set which would
have given the creditors and the receiver a similar initial dividend,
and comparable shares in the new enterprise -- almost a ''No win, No
fee'' basis?

Heartiest congratulations to the Royal SNO for honouring all serious
music lovers with their performance of Alfred Schnittke's Faust Contata.
While all UK orchestras are fighting for survival the bravery of the
Royal SNO to present a masterwork by a master composer, notwithstanding
the possibility of financial disaster, should qualify for the St Mungo
Prize.
Hats off to Paul Hughes together with his chairman, Morrison Dunbar,
for such an audacious undertaking, and if there is any justice in the
hard and cold world of today the Royal SNO will and should be
recompensated by larger and more committed audiences.  Shelley's
apposite phrase, ''Rarely, rarely comest thou Spirit of Delight'', has
rarely, in my opinion, been more exemplified. Viva Royal SNO.

I have never been a nationalist, Scottish or otherwise, but I must
admit that for some time I have felt a growing unease.
Is it only my imagination or is there a degree of asset stripping
going on involving the Government and Scotland?  Are we intended to prop
up other parts of the UK by the transference of jobs and industries?  I
am afraid that I find it hard to believe the reassurances of the
Scottish Office and the Government about how well we are doing. In fact,
the more they reassure me the more I worry.
Perhaps the time has come for a Scottish assembly, if only to provide
some economic protection to Scotland and its nationals.

THE jury at the Bonnyrigg bank robbery murder trial had a moment of
light relief as they watched a video recording.
It showed the scene as the alleged robbers burst into the bank. ''Get
down,'' they allegedly shouted to the bank staff and customers. There
was no reaction, allegedly, apart from the collie dog belonging to a
customer, which immediately lay flat on the floor.
Keep it secret
A FUNNY old place the BBC. Here they are devoting a whole day's
viewing to Comic Relief red nose day, the whole point of which is to
relieve us chaps of money to help Africa.
Then we hear of a memo sent out by one Nicholas Moss, head of policy
management at televison centre in London. ''In any coverage of Comic
Relief could you please arrange for your producers to ensure they
exercise the greatest care of references to where poeple can buy red
noses. Ideally, none should be named . . .''
The memo goes into some detail, with which we shall not trouble you,
about how the outlets might be mentioned but ends: ''As you know, the
presumption is against mentioning any of them.''
PS -- If you want to buy a red nose you can get one at Burger King,
Oxfam, Save the Children, Shell garages, or W H Smith. But don't tell
the BBC we told you.
The last word
MAURICE Lindsay, the intellectual and sage, has written his last
poems. Oh no, some might say. Thank the Lord, others might say.
Whatever your view, the works should be worth reading, if you believe
the publisher's blurb (as we always do at the Diary). Speaking of the
book News of the World: Last Poems, the Scottish Cultural Press says:
''This last collection shows Maurice Lindsay writing at the height of
his powers and achieving moments of almost mystic perfection . . . The
poet considers his own advancing years and the approach of the ultimate
experience -- death. But through the creative paradox of his art, the
combination of humility and boldness of spirit with which he speaks of
final things, Lindsay transforms the poems of mortality into triumphant
affirmations.''
Sounds great, but what is Mr Lindsay going to do, Sinatra-style, for a
follow-up?
Seeing is believing
THE John Menzies shop at Glasgow airport is selling copies of Tony
Blair: The Moderniser. Hold the front page, we hear you say. But we want
to tell you they have decided, for some reason, to put the book about
the boy leader of the Labour Party under the heading ''Latest Fiction''.
Life's a drag
IT is a familiar daily scene at a factory in the Kingsway industrial
estate in Dundee. A line of forlorn, huddled figures outside a factory
gate. The occasional passing driver toots his horn expressing solidarity
for the locked-out workers in what is obviously another strike to blight
the already scarred industrial face of Clootie City.
Except in this case it isn't. The location is the main printing plant
of D C Thomson, so it definitely ain't industrial action. Simply that
the publishers of the Sunday Post and sundry other weel-kent newspapers
have banned smoking not only in their buildings but also anywhere within
the perimeter.
Och, it's a hard life for the smoker these days.
Clean sheet
INTERESTING place the island of Bute but we had never hitherto
associated it with offshore finance. We are talking here about a
submission to the island's licensing court, as reported in that sturdy
publication The Buteman.
It reads: ''In making a plea for renewal of a provisional licence
granted to Mr Ian McCulloch for an ambitious development of Square One
in Gallowgate, solicitor Elaine Campbell explained that the search for
the shortfall in the verbally promised support had turned abroad. New
legislation to prevent money laundering had, however, held up the
transfer of a block of money from sources in Italy, Spain, and Malta.''
In the dark
NEWS from New Zealand (and keep your oxymorons to yourself): Prime
Minister Jim Bolger has initiated plans to abolish the imperial honours
system in the rump of the globe and replace it with awards more in
keeping with the modern world -- Companion of the Grand Kiwi Fruit,
Order of the Noble Lamp Chop, and suchlike.
Obviously enough, this attempt to follow Australia's lead hasn't gone
down too well with remaining empire loyalists, hence the claim down
under that the knights are fair drawing in.
No place like home
THE Scottish Office is pleased to announce (and we know because
they've announced it) that ''The number of people receiving a home help
service increased by 46% between 1980 and 1992. Over the same period the
number of home helps rose by 9% . . .''
This is, of course, wonderful news, but how was it achieved? Simple:
there was ''an increase in the average number of clients per home help
from six in 1980 to eight in 1992.'' Our sums make that a 33% increase
in productivity, yet there's no mention of the number of home helps now
in desperate need of home helps.

THIS week, according to the London Times, was the Week of Insolence.
Well, certainly in the House. Ann Widdicombe, an Unemployment -- pardon,
an Employment --Minister told Labour's ex-actress MP, Glenda Jackson,
that she was certain Ms Jackson had never got a job on the basis of her
looks. Steve Norris, the Transport Minister, was devoutly suspicious of
public transport on the basis that the bus-people were ''dreadful human
beings''. I don't myself use public transport either, on the basis that
the public do, but on the other hand I don't stand for public election
either.
Later of course, the Prime Minister described Tony Blair as a
''dimwit''. Blair may well be but it hardly does to call anybody a
dimwit in an accent such as John Major's. If Mrs Thatcher had need --
and she did -- to modify her accent and her tone of voice, then Major
has more of a necessity. He sounds for all the world like Peter Cook
taking the piss out of the inhabitants of Croydon. It is all very well
being from the people. It is quite another sounding like the Mr Pooter
with only a half pint of mild in him. Later a Labour MP said a Tory one
was a ''nitwit''. So are they all honorouble men. So are they all
dimwits and nitwits. But as insolence it hardly shapes up.
As insolence few can manage in today's House of Commons some of the
splendid remarks of the past. Hore-Belisha, a major figure in the Labour
governments and inventor of the Belisha Beacon, was once informed that
when he was circumcised ''they threw the wrong bit away''. Now there's
an insult. And perhaps the last great insult was Denis Healey's line on
Sir Geoffrey Howe: ''Being criticised by Howe is like being savaged by a
dead sheep''. Denis had real ability at insults, but he was hardly
subtle.
I always rather liked Alec Douglas-Home's riposte to Harold Wilson,
who had been going on for hours about how the Scottish aristo was the
14th Earl of Home. ''Come to think of it'', replied the good lord, ''I
suppose the leader of the Opposition is the 14th Mr Wilson''. And
Winston Churchill's insults remain legendary. To Lady Astor who had
blithely informed him that if he was her husband she'd poison him,
Churchill replied at once. ''Madam,'' he said, if I were your husband .
. .'' he paused, ''I'd drink it''.
But MPs are children in comparison to children. Weans can be a touch
direct though. I ever cherish the remark made to myself and a
supplementary teacher back in the days when I was in the schoolroom,
teaching the little boys and girls art and despair. A small girl with
hair the colour of a sunny cornfield and an expression of such beatific
innocence she would have passed for a Victorian scrap of an angel, once
told me that: ''As youse are that baldy, Sur, can youse no get a wig
like what Mrs Campbell huz?'' Mrs Campbell sported a wig which was so
obvious that she appeared to be wearing her breakfast on her head and
many years had been spent in cultivating an ignorance of this fact in
every staffroom.
The child's name was, I remember, Davina. And there was, believe me,
absolutely no question, that she was most purposeful in this appalling
insult to a very sensitive lady who had been thinning for over a decade.
There was only one response to this. ''Davina,'' I said, ''away you go
and attend to your work. At least Mrs Campbell can read and write''.
This went down equally badly with the both of them.
I remember as a child myself getting into a wee bit of soapy with a
teacher when he asked me how I had managed to do so well in my exams in
everything but maths and science. ''So you're not as glaiket as you make
out?'' I asked him who had told him that I had been first in English and
Latin and art and history. He told me that a wee bird had informed him.
I knew it had to be my rather portly register teacher. ''Was it a wee
fat bird?'' I enquired. It was followed by a long thin strap I
recollect.
But what adults always seemed to have up their sleeve was what they
described as ''Dumb Insolence''. Now this was ever somewhat of a poser
for the child accused of it. It often went along the lines of the query:
''Can you give me any reason why you should not be thrashed to the
condition of a quivering jelly'' or words along those lines. Well you
wanted to reply: ''Yes, Dr Goebbels, I can think of every reason in the
world, including the notion that you yourself should be taken to a
public place and thereby hanged till you are dead, and maybe worse'',
you wanted to return.
Instead you learned to mutter a low, and frightened ''No, Sir'',
because if you didn't say anything the belting was for dumb insolence
rather than anything you had actually committed. Adults in the 1950s
seemed to have obtained their role models from Mr Murdstone, for
heaven's sake.
But we live in a less robust age and children can now insult adults at
will and get away with it. The story of the august archbishop who went
round a school in some diocese in England recently comes to mind and a
child of perhaps 11 told the good man to ''eff off''. The arch drew
himself up and addressed the boy. He told him of his many long years at
the seminary, of his long years as a missionary, of his work at
university and college, of his lonely and hard-working decade out in
East Africa, of his degrees and of his good works. ''And after all
that'', said the cleric, ''you speak to me like that, a mere child. You
eff off''. But MPs are sensitive souls. Mind you, try insulting a
journalist. Don't.

THE evidence of the second System Three poll into support for
devolution, in this case in England, shows a general lack of interest in
the matter. Whatever the merits of Labour's proposals for a string of
regional assemblies south of the Border, nobody is clamouring for them
at the moment. That may mean that the matter has not sufficiently been
aired in England. It will, however, have to be aired in a General
Election and not least because the proposals for significant
constitutional change in Scotland are bound to impact on English
opinion. The state of play at the moment is that there is no marked
English hostility to change north of the Border, although there is a
slight but potentially significant cost to Labour. The response to the
Labour proposals for UK-wide constitutional change was to produce a net
loss of support for Labour of 1%. That may seem little but only if
Labour's huge lead in recent opinion polls is maintained. It may not be,
for students of voting behaviour have long identified a tendency of
opinion to harden in its old mould as a General Election's polling day
approaches.
The poll shows that whereas most Scots identify with Scotland rather
than Britain in establishing their identity, English respondents were
more evenly divided. Even there a slight majority (51%) accepted a
British rather than English identity. It may be that for English people
the terms British and English are in effect interchangeable (though some
English nationalists, like the late A J P Taylor, insisted that the
effect of the Union was to denationalise the English). The significance
of this difference, whatever its explanation, is enormous since it
confirms the underlying sentiment which sustains Scots hope for
constitutional change. No equal force even begins to emerge as
supporting regional assemblies. The only potential force of equal power
to Scottish feeling would be a coherent English national sentiment, but
none of the main political parties wishes to provoke such a reaction.
None, however, seems to have even considered how it might impose itself
on them, and how the Unionists, who dominate the three UK parties, would
be able to contain it were it to threaten to do so.
The poll, however, suggests that ''Wayward sisters, depart in peace''
would characterise English reactions to Home Rule for Scotland (and
might even extend to complete separation, if support for that
development went on growing). Would that benign mood survive Mr Blair's
pledge, assuming a Labour victory in 1996 or 1997, to pass the necessary
legislation in the first year of a new Parliament? It would not be an
easy passage since it would be opposed tooth and nail by an unrepentant
Opposition. It would be complicated legislation at the best of times
(who, for example, would pay any extra taxes a Scottish assembly might
impose?) and Mr Blair will have plenty of other matters on his plate.
Will he be able to command popular Scottish patience and understanding
if his timetable slips? (It seems unlikely that he will enjoy the
confidence of the Scottish Nationalists, whose future clout is, however,
unpredictable.) No great constitutional change in British history has
passed easily, and re-establishing a Scottish parliament in whatever
form will be no exception.

EDINBURGH Ladies have lived in the shadow of Western Klick Photopoint
for the best part of two decades but tomorrow, at the McTaggart Sports
Centre in Dundee, they could emulate the Glasgow side by completing the
indoor hockey league and cup double.
The cup already is in their possession and only Hyndland and
Menzieshill stand between them and a third successive league title.
Jill Messenger, the backbone of the Edinburgh side, reflected the
confidence of her colleagues when she said: ''No disrespect to our
opponents, but if we play to form then we shouldn't have too much
difficulty in getting the points.''
* MENZIESHILL striker John Christie yesterday flew out to New York to
guest for the New Jersey side, Bada, at this weekend's holiday
tournament in Toronto. With the indoor league and cup double secured for
the third time in five years, the Menzieshill captain should have been
on cloud nine as he set out but this was not the case.
Before he left he took the opportunity to have a swipe at the
competitions committee for rescheduling postponed outdoor league matches
for the weekend of February 17 to 19, in direct opposition to the
MIM-hosted European indoor club championship at Meadowbank.
Christie, reflecting the views of many enthusiasts, said: ''This is
the first time the championship has come to Britain and the players are
not being allowed to watch it. It's ridiculous.''
Moves are afoot to rectify the situation but the intervention may have
come too late although two of the games, involving neighbouring clubs,
could be played later in the season.

There were no real surprises in the public sector pay awards announced
yesterday, although doctors must feel that their harrying campaign of
recent months has brought modest dividends. Nevertheless, for most
public sector workers involved the settlement was close enough to their
worst expectations to rekindle considerable anger. The Government is
committed to close adherence to the pay policy for workers in this
sector which insists that all pay increases have to be met fully from
existing budgets. The strain which this imposes on those bodies like
local authorities and health boards which have to find the money for the
increases is considerable. Having laid down the economic parameters the
Government must now pay attention to the political implications of their
policies. These are likely to be difficult.
The obvious path for the Government to follow is to try to imply that
it has little responsibility for hardships, redundancies, and (in
England) the increased school class sizes which will be the inevitable
result. It's not our fault, runs the Government refrain. Local
authorities always seem to find money from somewhere, the apologists
will say. This is the purest nonsense; nor will it work any more. There
is a public appreciation of the fact that local authorities do not have
the central funding they once enjoyed. Just as clearly, there is no
doubt that it is the reduction of central government funding which has
allowed the present situation to develop. The Government can cast
blameless eyes to heaven and protest innocence until it is breathless,
but it will find the task of targeting local authorities in the next few
months as the culprits in the inevitable round of cuts and squeezes to
be quite impossible, and rightly so.
It is a sad reflection of Government policies that public sector
workers, who seek to deliver services which any society worthy of the
name requires to be done by public servants, have been penalised because
of political ideology. Running down state services is just part of the
assault on the public sector which is based in the belief that
Government has no part to play in the delivery of services to a
tax-paying society. Those who ask what Government's precise role is
supposed to be have thus far only had answers in the negative. It is
this nihilism, by which we mean extreme scepticism, which has brought
Britain to a position of considerable confusion as to what constitutes
society and how, or if, it is to develop. Aside from these grand
questions, but intimately connected, the public sector workers find
their pay and conditions squeezed and discover that according to
Government statistics their pay rates are ahead of the private sector.
As our investigation into pay on the page opposite shows, this is at
best misguided and at worst a deliberate misrepresentation. The heat and
anger of yesterday's pay awards will dissipate slowly but the
consequences will remain.

WILLIE Miller, sacked as manager of Aberdeen earlier this week,
yesterday revealed that he can still help the Dons in their bid to
compete with the Old Firm -- by becoming a shareholder when the club
goes public in the summer.
Miller, who spent 24 years as a player then manager at Pittodrie, said
yesterday that there was no feeling of bitterness from him over recent
events, and club chairman Ian Donald, the man who had to announce what
was an unpopular decision with the fans, did not rule out the
possibility of Miller returning as a director.
Miller, who could do nothing to halt Aberdeen's bad run which has seen
them slump to second bottom in the premier division -- they are just two
points ahead of bottom club Partick Thistle who have a game in hand --
backed the Pittodrie club's decision to go public and said: ''I will be
first in the queue to buy shares to help the club raise the money they
need to compete with Rangers and Celtic.
''I feel no bitterness towards Aberdeen and I would still do anything
to help them become the top team in the country again.
''During my 24 years at Pittodrie, I built up a strong feeling for the
Dons, probably a lot stronger than some of the supporters.
''Selling shares is something that the club should proceed with and
something I proposed when I was manager. It is for the long-term benefit
of the club and gives the fans the chance to become more involved.''
Said Donald: ''We will talk to Willie if he ever wants a place on the
board.''
Donald expects a demonstration against him during the match against
Rangers at Pittodrie on Sunday by fans angry at the sacking of Miller.
Meanwhile, Roy Aitken, the man charged with restoring Aberdeen's
fortunes, will get on with the job in the same professional manner he
showed as a player.
At the height of his playing days with Celtic, the big fellow always
led the charge, often to the wrath of opposing fans, including those of
Aberdeen. But Aitken knows he faces a huge task in steering the
Pittodrie side to premier division safety.
He has taken on the job knowing that his appointment is not a popular
one with everyone in the north-east. But, despite that disadvantage, the
former Scotland internationalist is determined that by the end of the
season his title of caretaker manager will be reduced to manager.
''I know I am not the man the supporters want for the job,'' he said.
''My appointment is not going to please everyone, but that does not
worry me. They appreciate I' committed to the club and will give it my
best shot.
''A lot of fans resented me when I first came here, but I never had
any doubts about joining Aberdeen and would not have if I had. Nor would
I have accepted this challenge if I had any doubts now. Hopefully, I
have earned the respect of our support and intend earning more by the
end of the season.''
One of Aitken's first moves has been to put back contract talks with
five of his squad, rightly believing that getting points for the club is
a much higher priority than individual deals.
As a result, Duncan Shearer, Scott Booth, Stephen Wright, Paul Kane,
and Brian Irvine will have to wait to discuss their futures.
Said Aitken: ''The club must come first and the players understand
this. Hopefully, new deals will be tied up in the weeks ahead, but the
immediate priority is to get the club out of its present position.''
Against Rangers, Aberdeen will again be without injured pair Eoin Jess
and Ray McKinnon, but midfielder Peter Hetherston is fit.

<HEADLINE>Football has to fence with trouble. Chelsea chairman wants 'vigilante' scheme</HEADLINE>

PERIMETER fences could go back up inside English grounds unless clubs
are successful in putting down a new outbreak of hooliganism.
The possibility of a return to barriers has been raised by Chelsea in
the aftermath of ugly crowd disturbances at the end of their FA Cup tie
against Millwall on Wednesday night, when 38 people were arrested, 19
fans charged, and 11 policemen injured.
It was suspected that the tie, decided in Millwall's favour after a
penalty shoot-out, might be used as an opportunity for some
troublemakers, who masquerade as supporters, to make their presence felt
again after a spell during which football was relatively free of
hooliganism.
The meeting of the London clubs and their supporters, who have a
notorious rivalry, was always going to be a tense affair, and even
though there was a massive police presence, it proved impossible to
prevent an outbreak of fighting.
Chelsea, who reached the FA Cup final last season, now face
repercussions from the authorities.
But no-one should gloat, because trouble can flare at any ground. Even
in Scotland, where the game has been free of violence within stadiums,
there is a need for constant vigilance, as the incident involving Davie
Cooper at Tynecastle on Tuesday proved.
A supporter spat on Cooper as he and his Clydebank team-mates were
leaving the pitch at the end of the Scottish Cup, third-round replay
against Hearts. The former Rangers winger reported the incident to the
police, but the culprit had run off, and Lothian and Borders Police last
night confirmed they were taking the matter seriously.
John Borthwick, secretary of the Federation of Hearts Supporters'
Clubs, called on fans to point out offenders, and his attitude is
exactly the response Chelsea's chairman, Ken Bates, is seeking from his
club's supporters. Bates, of course, is the man who once considered
electrifying fences at the West London ground, but later dropped the
idea, although now he wants to introduce a ''vigilante'' scheme.
Writing in the programme for the Millwall match, he said: ''Bad
behaviour is a curse. Stewards are paid to stop this, but if they do
nothing, tell us. Better still, since the good guys greatly outnumber
the bad, have your own neighbourhood watch operation.''
Scottish supporters could also point out offenders and make it easier
for the police and stewards to remove them, but putting fences back up
would be an admission that all the hard work and money spent on policing
Scottish football was in vain.
Also, as the discussion south of the Border takes in the possible
re-erection of fences, it would be wise to pause and consider why they
were done away with in the first place.
They were dragged down after the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989, when
fans were crushed to death because they could not spill on to the
trackside after a surge behind them.
A perimeter fence would have prevented Manchester United's Eric
Cantona from what seemed to be an attack on a supporter 15 days ago.
But that is no argument for putting the barriers up and making fans
feel as though they are caged in. English football will consider going
back to the bad old days, but the game in the south should resist and
find another way.
Nevertheless, Chelsea's managing director, Colin Hutchinson, issued a
statement. ''Football spectators, by consistent good behaviour, had
perimeter fences removed. Sadly, there is a danger of the actions of a
few bringing them back.''
The Football Association reacted coolly to that, with spokesman Colin
Davies pointing out: ''We have to look at all the possibilities, but if
you believe what happened at Chelsea to be an isolated incident, the
balance of probability would be against a return to fences.''
However, the FA, who are sure to hold an inquiry into the shocking
events at Stamford Bridge, welcomed Chelsea's decision to launch their
own investigation to identify troublemakers on video and ban them from
the ground.
Commander Anthony Rowe of Scotland Yard said: ''We cannot prevent
pitch invasions but we are largely successful in keeping rival fans
apart.''
A spectator attack on a referee at Blackburn, the Cantona incident,
and crowd problems at both Chelsea-Millwall FA Cup meetings have brought
hooliganism sharply back into the public eye. ''We have made great
strides in dealing with hooligans in recent years and I hope we are not
going back to the days when they seemed to dominate the game,'' said FA
Chief Executive Graham Kelly.
A 400-strong police contingent and hundreds of stewards formed what
was believed to be the biggest security operation at a London match in
recent times. Chelsea's security precautions seemed thorough too, but a
few hot-heads slipped through the net, and now Chelsea face a fine and
the possibility of being ordered to play behind closed doors.
That would mean an alarming loss of finance and Chelsea are bound to
resist any such move, but those who remember the faces of fans trapped
behind fences at Hillsborough would prefer that as alternative.
* MORTON manager Allan McGraw yesterday called for the SFA to look
again at the Scottish Cup replay rule, because he is unhappy that clubs
should be forced into playing two ties in midweek.
McGraw believes that this could influence the promotion and relegation
issues.
This week Meadowbank Thistle and Berwick Rangers were involved in a
cup-tie on Monday and then replayed, with extra time, on Tuesday. Now
they each will meet promotion hopefuls Dumbarton and Clyde tomorrow in
the the league.
McGraw said: ''I do not think it is correct that this should happen.
The days of cup-ties being replayed time after time are gone because of
the penalty shoot-out.
''Now, however, we have these clubs, whose players must have been
stretched this week, going into games on Saturday which can influence
the outcome of the league season. I am unhappy about that for we are one
of the clubs desperately trying for promotion.''
* CHELSEA striker Robert Fleck is to spend a second month on loan to
Bristol City after making four appearances in his first spell.
* THE Scottish League have arranged a programme for next Tuesday
night. The matches are:
Premier division -- Partick Thistle v Dundee United. First division --
Airdrie v Clydebank. Third division -- Caledonian Thistle v Montrose,
East Stirling v Albion Rovers.

MASSIVE world tours by rock groups Dire Straits and Genesis helped to
push the overseas earnings of the British music industry beyond #1bn in
1993, according to a major report published yesterday.
A survey by British Invisibles, the private sector export promotions
organisation, suggests that Britain is a leading world centre for music
publishing and that the music business as a whole makes a very
significant contribution to the nation's economy. Its annual income is
now comparable to that of the UK steel industry.
More importantly, the survey shows that British music's exports --
#1,158m -- were virtually double the value of its imports. Only a
handful of niche industries with exports above #1bn can match this
performance.
While some of the earnings came from visible exports like CDs,
records, musical instruments and sheet music, the bulk (69%) came from
invisibles. These were mostly through record company royalties and
performance fees.
A breakdown of the figures shows that recording (Britain has 200
recording studios) was the industry's biggest moneyspinner with gross
overseas earnings of #368m. Music publishing came second with #248m,
while live performances abroad scored a remarkable #100m.
Among the top groups and artists who embarked on world tours in 1993
were Dire Straits (who earned #16.84m) and Genesis (#17.27m). The live
performance figure is expected to be even higher in 1994 on the back of
international tours by acts like Pink Floyd, Phil Collins, and the
Rolling Stones.
The music industry's performance bears favourable comparison with that
of the British film and television industries. While both film and TV
enjoy substantially high gross invisible earnings from overseas sales
and inward investment, their net position is less attractive. Television
has a net deficit of #115m on overseas trade while film generates a
surplus of only #208m.
The report, which also takes account of classical music's
contribution, concludes: ''The strength of the UK music industry
internationally rests on the creative talent of British composers,
performers, and lyricists allied to the business skills of music
companies and entrepreneurs.''
Indications suggest that 1994 will prove to have been an even better
year. Changes in musical tastes, with people turning away from the
American-based rap music and country and western, and the success of new
British groups like Take That and Blur.
Speaking at the launch of the report in London, Trade and Technology
Minister Ian Taylor said: ''No one disputes the importance of music in
everyone's lives, but what may not be so obvious is the financial
benefit the UK economy derives from music.''
However, he highlighted the music industry and the Government's
concern about piracy and counterfeiting, particularly of CDs by the
Chinese.

GAVIN Hastings, Scotland's rugby captain, will not play for Watsonians
in the national league match against Heriot's at Goldenacre tomorrow.
In the past three weeks the 33-year-old full back has played in two
internationals, sandwiching a hard club championship match against
Boroughmuir, and club officials believe he deserved a rest before taking
part in three more internationals in the next five weeks.
Watsonians, whose championship challenge slipped with their defeat by
Boroughmuir, have to beat Heriot's to stay in the hunt for the title. To
cover for Hastings's absence, they have switched Fergus Henderson to
full back and recalled Graeme Inglis on the right wing.
Elsewhere, half of the pack have gone after the defeat by Boroughmuir.
Jason Fayres has been restored at tighthead, David Weir and Colin
Campbell at lock, and Gordon Hannah at No.8.

AUSTRALIAN David Diaz equalled an unofficial putting world record when
he took just eight putts over the opening nine holes in the first round
of the South Australian Open yesterday.
Diaz, playing masterly golf in difficult, windy conditions, equalled
the record shared by five Americans, all playing in the United States.
He shares the lead on 67 with New Zealander Michael Long at six under
on the par-73 Royal Adelaide course.
Diaz teed off into afternoon winds gusting up to 35 knots. He shot two
eagles, including one on the par-4 eighth, where he drove 325 metres and
holed a 15-metre chip shot. Leading aggregates (Australian unless
otherwise stated):
67 -- M Long (New Zealand), D Diaz. 68 -- W Smith, J O'Keefe (USA), T
Elliott, C Gray. 69 -- D Armstrong, D Capaldo, R Stephens. 70 -- A
Painter, D Cole, P Moss (USA). 71 -- M Colandro (USA), D Galloway, D
Iwasaki-Smith, S Leaney, M Allen, G Moorhead (New Zealand), P Brew, B
King, G Chalmers, O Moore, T Price, R Backwell.

GARRISON Savannah struck a blow for National Hunt racing's elder
statesmen yesterday at Wincanton to help clinch a 1111-1 four-timer for
trainer Jenny Pitman.
The Gold Cup hero of 1991 proved that even aged 12, there is still
life at the top when claiming a second successive victory in the Racing
In Wessex Chase.
Following wins by Gilpa Valu and Nahthen Lad at Huntingdon, and Jibber
The Kibber at Wincanton, Garrison Savannah rallied on the run in to deny
odds-on favourite Young Hustler by two lengths.
His Grand National price was cut to 16-1 from 25-1 as the pair came
clear of stablemate Esha Ness, a 33-1 chance after having finished a
distance behind in third.
Pitman bought Garrison Savannah in Ireland, the same day she picked up
Esha Ness, Royal Athlete, and Willsford.
''I'll never spend a better 7500gns,'' said the trainer. ''This horse
will kill me. I'll have a heart attack one day. I never thought he would
win over two miles five furlongs in this gluey ground.''
Garrison Savannah, with 9st 4lb, and Esha Ness will spearhead a
six-strong Aintree assault by the Pitman stable.
''I'm glad this race came after the weights because 9st 4lb will do.
With six at Liverpool I don't think I will be able to stand the
strain.''
Although a 16-1 chance, Jibber The Kibber was not unfancied by his
trainer. ''He has been unlucky and would have won at Warwick but for a
horse falling in front of him,'' said Pitman.
Former smart staying chaser Espy, another 12-year-old and brother of
former Foxhunters winner Observe, launched his challenge for the
Cheltenham race with a win in the Wincanton Hunters Chase.
At Huntingdon, Gilpa Valu, the favourite, gained compensation for an
unlucky last-fence spill at Nottingham last time.
However, his supporters must have been worried when he appeared to cut
across the runner-up, Full Of Oats, at the last.
But Rod Farrant, who rode the second, said: ''He didn't interfere with
me and I was beaten at the time.''
Half an hour later Nahthen Lad landed the day's feature event. ''We've
got no set plans for him,'' said Mark Pitman, representing his mother,
''and we'll have to look in the programme book to see where we go
next.''

PAUL Wardell shot three early birdies yesterday on his way to a
three-under-par 66, which gave him his first victory in the East of
Scotland Golfers Alliance outing at Kilspindie.
Wardell, who will be full time on the Tartan Tour this year, has
stated his initial aim is to qualify for the Scottish professional
championship at Dalmahoy in May.
Jimmy Hume was one shot behind Wardell on 67 yesterday, with Gary Weir
and his two assistants Euan McIntosh and Ian Young on 68.
Jim Hastings, well into the veteran stage, won the handicap section by
a stroke with an 80 less 16, net 64, from four players. Leading scores:
Scratch: 66 -- P Wardell (Longniddry). 67 -- J Hume (Gullane). 68 -- G
Weir, E McIntosh, I Young (all Braid Hills DR). 69 -- C Morris
(Duddingston), K Kelly (Baberton), D Anderson, J R Clarkston (both
Harburn).
Handicap: 64 -- J Hastings (Mortonhall,16). 65 -- B Dunn
(Glenbervie,12), J Hay (Pitfirrane,9), J T Anderson (Kingsknowe,5), D
Brown (Glenbervie,14).
Assistants: 68 -- McIntosh, Young. 69 -- Morris. 72 -- D Drysdale

MAYBE it will get better, but 1995 has not been shaping up as a
halcyon year for football here or abroad.
So far we have had the Eric Cantona disgrace, an Italian fan stabbed
to death, a riot at Stamford Bridge, and on-going inquiries into bribery
and corruption. Happy new year.
The violence which erupted at Chelsea's ground on Wednesday night,
along with the recent killing of a Genoa fan, served to remind us that
the dreaded disease is still with us.
There have been major improvements in Scotland since the banning of
drink inside stadiums, and the only serious trouble recently has taken
place away from the grounds, in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
However, it would be foolish to believe that what might be a renewal
of the eighties phenomenon in England, when large elements of the
supporters of their clubs and international side were detested and
feared throughout Europe and beyond, could not find sympathisers north
of the Border.
Equally, the recent happenings have confirmed that all-seated stadiums
are not the panacea for crowd trouble. If thugs wish to cause bother
they will do it standing on seats just as easily as standing on
terracings.
Most of all, however, what the ugly battles between Chelsea and
Millwall supporters illustrated again is that beneath the surface of
fierce rivalry, there is a violent explosion needing only to be
detonated.
Police in Scotland have long been aware of that hidden dynamite,
particularly in Old Firm matches, and all their actions and precautions
are designed to make sure it remains latent.
That is why those few who sprang to Cantona's defence after his karate
dive into the crowd at Crystal Palace should have another close look at
their reasonings.
They may well have been blinded by their own love of football and
their desire to see it played by great exponents like the Frenchman, but
that is poor excuse for failing to see beyond the confines of the sport
itself.
If one of the Chelsea or Millwall players had behaved in Cantona
fashion on Wednesday night, it is shuddering to think of the
consequences.
It is the ever-present possibility of violent eruption among fans that
places a special responsibility on professional footballers, who are
highly paid not only because they can play, but because they are
expected to act professionally.
It really does not matter how talented, how badly treated by opponents
or referees, or how intimidated he may have been, no footballer can be
permitted to risk a full-scale riot by venting his fury outside the
ropes.
The events of Stamford Bridge should have brought home to Cantona's
apologists exactly what might have been the consequence of his manic
behaviour.
Seve chips in to bury
the hopes of hackers
THE more we hackers try to get to grips with the impossibilities of
golf, the more the smart asses of the business demonstrate how futile
our task will ever be. The great man, Seve, was at it this week, telling
the world how he and his coach, Mac Grady, took a cardboard box full of
pictures showing him swinging badly and buried it in the desert.
Do people like Ballesteros not appreciate what such a jaunty little
tale does to the rest of us? Does he not appreciate that half the
rabbits of the world have been sweating and straining and cursing and
swearing for umpteen years trying to swing as badly as him.
If he has been swinging poorly, we should all head for the desert and
dump the clubs beside his pictures. Give us a break, Seve.

AS the blood pressure rises among the faithful, Love Street most
certainly is not living up to its name. Saints are sinners. The once
proud men from Paisley are weaving a pattern that, according to fans
ready to stage a demonstration tomorrow during St Mirren's
first-division match against Raith Rovers, is leading to disaster.
Relegation, even oblivion, is facing the men who play in black and
white -- with, as is the usual case, the manager taking the flak. At the
moment, Jimmy Bone is in the black zone so far as the paying customers
are concerned.
But where lack of money is the root of most football evils, listening
to Money may give the Paisley diehards cause for more thought.
Campbell Money has been with St Mirren for his entire senior career --
17 years out of the 34 he has to his name. The keeper probably will go
down in history as the George Niven of Rangers type of player -- one of
the finest never to have been awarded a full cap.
Yet, it is worth listening to the man, now assistant to Bone, who has
served under eight St Mirren managers. He names with hardly a thought --
Alex Ferguson, Jim Clunie, Ricky McFarlane, Alex Miller, Alex Smith,
Tony Fitzpatrick, David Hay, and Bone.
He has known the highs and lows since becoming first-team choice in
goal in the 1983-84 season, none more so than being in the side which
lost 5-1 to Forfar in the League Cup, then went on during the same 86-87
season to win a Scottish Cup medal with a 1-0 win over Dundee United.
His message is simple. ''Every team goes through a cycle. We were on a
high finishing third in the league under Fergie in the late 70s. The cup
win under Alex Smith was another, and, remember, Jimmy Bone was his
assistant.
''We're going through a bad spell. Everyone at the club does not need
to be reminded about that. Our confidence is low, but Jimmy Bone, coach
Kenny McDowall, and myself believe that we will come through it.
''Lack of experience has been our main problem but, to solve that, you
need money, it's not there. But everyone is backing the manager, and we
know that if the players can gain the confidence they need from a couple
of victories -- we've not been playing that badly -- then we can go on
from there.''
Raith Rovers, on a run of seven straight league victories, are in a
promotion position that Saints probably would give part of their
redeveloping stadium for, and trying to prise themselves clear of that
third-bottom spot tomorrow will be tough.
But, as Money and his fellow backroom staff say: ''We've got to start
somewhere.''

SEVERIANO Ballesteros, playing his last European Tour event until
after the US Masters in April, is set to go out in style after a superb
first round at the Canary Islands Open in Gran Canaria yesterday.
The 37-year-old Spanish maestro, going round in the worst of the
weather, shot a four-under-par 68 to share the lead with Irishman Philip
Walton, England's Paul Eales, and Gary Orr of Scotland -- but there was
little doubt he played the best golf of the day.
Walton and Eales both played in the morning in almost ideal
conditions, but as Ballesteros teed off in the afternoon, the wind got
up and made scoring difficult.
''Maybe it was worth two or three shots better,'' said Ballesteros at
the end of his round. ''But this was the best I have played from tee to
green for a long time.''
Despite sinking two monster putts, one of 40 feet at the eleventh and
another of 60ft at the thirteenth, Ballesteros insisted putting was not
the key to his good round.
''On the front nine, I had many birdie chances and made none,'' he
said. ''But I drove very well and missed only two fairways.''
Asked if he could win the tournament, the Spaniard smiled and said:
''I intend to remain humble, as always. That is the key to this game.
Never say what might happen.''
Orr, starting at the tenth in the afternoon, also had to cope with the
wind, and was one over par after eight. But he had five birdies in his
last 10 holes to snatch a share of the lead.
''I was a bit rusty at the beginning of the season,'' said Orr. ''But
I was not worried because today I played really well -- my best shot was
a three wood to eight feet at the eighth.''
Walton had only one bogey and five birdies in his 68, and said he owed
it to good putting and the fact he chipped in from 50ft at the first
hole -- his tenth.
Eales, by contrast, said he was nervous on very fast greens. He added:
''I hit down the middle all day and was never in trouble. ''It was a
very satisfying round, and my only problem was fighting against taking
three putts. But I only did so once.''
Late in the day, England's Gary Emerson threatened to take the lead
when he went to four under after 12 holes. But he dropped a shot at the
fourteenth and, after a birdie at the sixteenth, dropped another at the
next.
He had to be content with joint fifth on 69, with Kent's Jamie Spence
and Sweden's Robert Karlsson.

* TONY Johnstone, the defending champion, returned a six-under-par 66
in the opening round of the South African Open yesterday.
He leads by two shots from four players, including fellow Zimbabwean
Mark McNulty.
Johnstone went out in 31 with five birdies in seven holes from the
second. But he started back bogey, birdie, bogey, and had to wait until
the last hole before getting back on track, when he hit a No.3 wood to
three feet and tapped in for an eagle three. Ernie Els finished six
shots off the pace despite also eagling the last.
''It's such a relief to stand on the tee and know where your ball is
going to go,'' said Johnstone. ''I haven't had that feeling for eight
months. ''I went back to England for two weeks and worked with my coach
and it has paid off.'' Leading scores:
66 -- T Johnstone (Zimbabwe).
68 -- M McNulty (Zimbabwe), J Johnson (U.S.), S Hendley (U.S.), A
McLardy.
69 -- D Robertson (U.S.).
70 -- R Goosen, I Hutchings, S van Vuuren, M Ure (Britain).

NICK Faldo was grumbling. ''I turned what could have been a 66 into a
71,'' he said after another dreadful day on the greens in the opening
round of the Buick Invitational on the 7000-yard South course at Torrey
Pines yesterday.
His one under par card left the 37-year-old Briton six strokes behind
the early leaders on 65. They included the 1993 champion Phil Mickelson,
Dan Pohl and David Edwards. Payne Stewart and David Ogrin were on 66
with the defending champion, Craig Stadler, and the Ryder Cup veteran
Larry Nelson on 67.
''It's the putter not the puttee,'' moaned Faldo who missed a handful
of short putts including a three-footer on the green at the short
sixteenth.
He went out in 36 but began to get into his best stride by holing
birdie putts of four feet and eight feet on the eleventh and thirteenth
greens.
Northern Ireland's David Feherty scored a fine 69 while Jesper
Parnevik had a 72. Faldo will have to play hard on the shorter North
course tomorrow to be sure to qualify. Early scores:
65 -- P Mickelson, D Pohl, C Dimarco, D Edwards.
66 -- P Stewart, B Faxon, H Sutton, D Ogrin, G Burns, C Chamblee.
67 -- L Nelson, C Stadler, K Gibson, J Hayes.
68 -- C Byrom, P Jacobsen, B Wadkins, Y Mizumaki (Japan), N Henke.
69 -- D Feherty (Northern Ireland), B Kamm, J Mahaffey.
70 -- B Tway, J Mudd, K Clearwater, C Beck, J Ozaki (Japan).
71 -- M Calcavechia, N Faldo (GB).
72 -- J Parnevik (Sweden), W Levi, S Elkington, D Waldorf, B Bryant.
73 -- B Crenshaw, D Stockton Jr

KAREN Macleod, who finished fourth in the Commonwealth Games marathon
last year, is the only woman pre-selected by Britain for the world
championships in Gothenburg.
Edinburgh Athletic Club's Macleod, born in Kenya, brought up on Skye,
but now based near Bath, confirmed yesterday that she was accepting the
place.
Richard Nerurkar, fourth in the European championship race last year
in Helsinki, had already accepted the only male early selection offered.
The others will be named following the London Marathon on April 2, which
could mean a place for Liz McColgan if she makes a successful comeback.
Macleod, an asthmatic, has turned down a lucrative run in the Toronto
Marathon to accept August's championship race in Sweden. ''I feel I have
something to prove,'' she said. ''I did not perform well last time I ran
for Britain, at the world championships two years ago, when I finished
sixteenth.
''The conditions were really difficult for me, and I take exception to
the suggestion from selectors that I was more committed, and prepared
better, at the Commonwealths, in Victoria, when I was running for
Scotland.''
There she collapsed, demolishing a feeding station table, cutting a
leg and injuring a hip, yet she got up to run the fastest time of her
life.
The performances which confirmed her place, however, conclusive
evidence of her continued form, were a high placing in Brazil's Sao
Silvestre road race on Hogmanay, and second in the Marakesh half
marathon last month with a time of 71-40. She finished just 14 seconds
behind Italy's Olga Ferraro, who was fourth in last year's European
championship marathon.
The result was one of the few good things about the Marakesh trip.
Macleod has a life-long aversion to snakes, and was terrified by a
couple of cobras produced in a market bazaar by a snake charmer. ''I
took off, raced away. Half the crowd followed me because they thought
I'd spotted a bargain. I was just petrified.
''When I was four, and living in Kenya, a mamba came in the window
when my sister and I were in our bath. We shrieked and shrieked until
somebody rushed in and killed it. And I've been paranoid ever since.
''In fact, I probably owe my running ability to snakes. When I was at
school, on Skye, I knew there were adders on the golf course where we
did cross-country -- there was a preserved body of one which had been
killed on the course, in a jar in our biology lab. It gave me the
shivers. I used to hurtle round the course, just to get it over. The
year after I left, a boy was bitten doing cross-country.
''That was how I discovered I'd the ability to run.
''I feel I am sitting on a good marathon time now, possibly sub 2hr
30min. I hope, if I can do that, that I'll be pre-selected for next
year's Olympics.''
* GEOFF Parsons, the Anglo who landed bronze at the Commonwealth
Games, is the latest defector from Britain's team for the indoor
international against France at the Kelvin Hall tomorrow. Teenager James
Brierly comes in to face European indoor silver medallist Jean-Charles
Gicquel.
Glen Stewart, the Scottish 3000m champion, has been given a guest run
in the meeting at the same distance. Aileen McGillivray, who shares the
Scottish 60m record (7.36) with Mel Neef, has a guest lane in the
sprint.
* THERE is a stay of execution on cancellation of Scotland's
international fixture against Israel, Turkey, Wales, and Northern
Ireland.
SAF officials had set a deadline of Wednesday evening to assemble a
#22,000 sponsorship package to save the meeting. But last night
federation secretary Bob Greenoak revealed that negotiations with a
possible backer had begun. ''A final decision will be made within a few
days,'' he confirmed.

EIGHT championship best performances beaten or equalled, and one
national age- group record smashed by dead-heating winners, were
testimony to improving standards yesterday at the TSB Scottish Schools
indoor athletics championships in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall, writes Doug
Gillon.
Ally Donaldson, from Stewart's Melville, revealed more of his
prodigious talent by winning the over-16 400 metres in a
record-equalling 50.00sec. The former AAA champion at 800m, 1500m, and
3000m sandwiched this contest between two crucial schools rugby matches.
With 27 tries to his credit this year, he will help his team against
joint leaders Watson's, on Saturday.
Despite a rugby knock sustained a day earlier, Loretto's Adam Lowles
put up a tremendous battle against Portobello's Andrew Lees in the
senior 200m. The judges could not separate them, both given 22.3, which,
but for the lack of electronic timing apparatus, would be a national
under-17 record (22.41). Add Lees' record-equalling 60m win in 7.05, and
it was a glorious confirmation of recovery for a man who was on crutches
six months ago after a knee surgery.
Lee McConnell was the most successful female, with a double in the
200m and high jump, including a record in the former with 25.4sec.
* COLIN Jackson's unbeaten hurdles run came to end last night in
Madrid after 44 races. The Welshman and Allen Johnson clocked 7.42, but
the American got the verdict. Irina Privalova set a world 50m record en
route to equalling her own world 60m best, with 5.96 and 6.92
respectively.

JOHN Higgins continued to justify his wild-card invitation to the
Benson &amp; Hedges Masters snooker championship at the Wembley Conference
Centre yesterday.
The Scot maintained his excellent form of late to scupper Alan
McManus' hopes of defending the title.
And after Higgins had completed an impressive 5-2 quarter-final
victory, McManus said: ''John is on a roll. He's playing superbly. He'll
take some stopping.''
Higgins, winner of the Skoda Grand Prix in October and runner-up in
the Regal Welsh Open 11 days ago, will meet Jimmy White tomorrow for a
place in the final.
White, despite a fast start, made his share of unforced errors in a
5-3 victory over Thailand's James Wattana.
''From 2-0 I didn't play all that well,'' admitted White after a
much-needed result which gave him two victories in an event for the
first time in nine attempts this season.
Breaks of 67 and 85 gave White his start, but Wattana, another member
of the game's elite having a less than productive season, hauled his way
back into contention, winning three of the following four frames to
level at 3-3 before White regained the advantage.

FIONA Brown of Greenacres moved to the top of the rankings yesterday
evening after four rounds of play in the Bank of Scotland Junior Curling
Championships in Kilmarnock's Galleon Centre.
In the last of three games yesterday, Brown beat Ayr's Kirsty Drummond
by 6-4 to maintain her 100% record. This was Drummond's only defeat so
far and she was joined on three wins by Stranraer's Catherine Wright who
beat Sheila Swan of Kinross by 10-4.
At the other end of the table, Alison Meechan of Lockerbie went down
to her fourth defeat out of four to Lesley Stobo of Hamilton and, for
her, a semi-final place at the weekend now looks unlikely.
In the men's event, Tom Brewster of Lockerbie tops the table with
three wins out of three. His victims yesterday were former world junior
champion James Dryburgh of Aviemore, who went down by 5-7, and
Murrayfield's Chris Hildrey, who was beaten by 8-1.
MEN. Second round -- C Hildrey 7, D Gladstone 2; R MacKay 3, L McLeary
7; T Brewster 7, J Dryburgh 5; C Wilson 9, D Mundell 2.
Third round -- R MacKay 4, J Dryburgh 6; C Wilson 8, D Gladstone 3; L
McLeary 4, D Mundell 10; T Brewster 8, C Hildrey 1.
Standings (after three rounds) -- Brewster, 3 wins, 0 losses; Wilson,

IT was far removed from the glitz and glory of Doug Williams' playing
days this week as the veteran quarterback sat down to set out some
'offensive plays'' for the Scottish Claymores, our first national
American football team, who will compete in the World League of American
Football when it kicks off in April.
The Claymores' wide-receivers' mastermind met up with head coach Lary
Kuharich at Tierra Verde in Florida at the start of a month-long
think-tank, in which the pair will formulate tactics for a side who have
never played together, most of whom have never met, and with a notable
number living across the Pond.
Making the scenario stranger still, though, is the involvement of
Williams with the embryonic team at all. For here is a man who is a
living legend in his home country and an inspiration to thousands of
aspiring coloured American football players. Yet your average Scottish
sports fan would not know him from Adam.
It was Williams, of the Washington Redskins, who, in Super Bowl XXII
in 1988, rewrote the record books. He broke through a then strong racial
barrier to become the first black quarterback on a winning team,
smashing four long-standing Super Bowl playing records in the process,
and helping his side to an emphatic 42-10 win over the Denver Broncos.
So, how does this enigma come to be coaching with the little-known
Claymores?
''To understand,'' Williams said, ''I'm going to have to backtrack a
little.''
His induction into the hearts of a football-infatuated American public
was not as straightforward as such a short curriculum vitae would
suggest. Having led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the National Football
League play-offs on three occasions, by 1982 Williams was relegated to
playing in the now defunct United States Football League. By 1987 he had
managed to sign for the Redskins -- as a free agent -- starting the
season as a back-up.
If, then, his progression to the berth of first-choice quarterback
that campaign was startling, so, too, was his decline from prominence at
the end of his playing career in 1989. Coaching posts with state
colleges were applied for with no success and a recurring ''no
experience'' response forced him to aim lower.
''I had always said, even before my playing days, that coaching was
something I wanted to do. So, when I was turned down for college posts,
I took the opportunity to return to my old high school to coach,''
Williams explained.
Since then, Williams has filled a number of more prominent coaching
posts and now maintains a move to the World League of American Football
is far from a come down. In fact, he sees it as a ''progressive career
move'' which will lead towards realising another ambition.
''My philosophy is that you should concentrate on what you would like
to be doing with your life and my goal is to one day be a college head
coach. I feel the opportunity to coach the Scottish Claymores will add
to the experience I need to realise that ambition.''
Only seven native-born Scots have played themselves into the Claymores
for an opening encounter with the Rhein Fire at Murrayfield on 9 April.
The remainder of the team comprise NFL hopefuls, hungry to impress on
what promises to be a well-publicised world stage.
Having never been to Scotland, Williams has only ever seen photographs
of the 67,500 all-seater Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh. He said it
was a ''beautiful arena'' and draws further confidence in his side's
home contingent from the game normally played on that hallowed turf.
''I don't know what rugby is like, but I do know you've got all these
guys walking around with no pads on. I'm terrified of the Scots guys
already.''

NINE winners in the past month have given Len Lungo a comfortable lead
of three over his nearest rival Peter Monteith in the race for The
Herald's Leading Scottish Trainer Award.
The Carrutherstown trainer, who was made evens favourite to win the
championship, had a slow start to the season but, since the new year,
the Hetland Hill yard has been in tremendous form.
This was confirmed at Carlisle on Tuesday when 11-year-old veteran
Another Dyer came home nine lengths clear of his rivals, and Santa
Concerto showed a devastating turn of foot in the bumper to easily
dispose of the opposition and win by 15 lengths.
Lungo's odds have been cut to 1-2, with Monteith on 2-1. The only
other serious contender, Colin Parker, is quoted at 10-1.
Not only is Lungo dominating the Scottish scene, but, with nine
winners from 50 runners in a 28 day-period, he was only bettered
nationwide by David Nicholson and Martin Pipe.
Eight days ago, he scored a double at Sedgefield with two other
promising youngsters, Livio, a four-year-old bought off the Flat from
John Gosden, and Oat Couture, bred in Dumfriesshire by Alix Stevenson
and soon to race over fences.
With these recent successes, which included Sheelin Lad lifting a
major prize for the feature novices' chase at Ayr last month, it appears
that Lungo has fearsome ammunition with which to establish himself as
Scotland's No.1 jumps trainer.
At this stage last year he had 13 winners and finished on 27, his
highest total. Now, in only his fifth season, he has 15 winners and
every prospect of improving on last season.
Monteith may not have as many horses in his Rosewell yard, but having
led the championship from the first day -- when Beldine won at Perth --
until a week ago, he has by no means given up the fight.
Colin Parker, on nine winners, is another with more quality than
quantity in his yard. Trump has scored four times, while Boarding School
is coming back to his best form, and Sparky Gayle looks to be in a
different class on his showing at Ayr recently.
Competition is keen among the permit-holders with Alistair Whillans on
four winners from 15 runners, followed by his brother, Donald, and Dawn
Goodfellow on three.

CHEMICALS group BOC reported profits at the lower end of city
expectations in the first quarter of the year.
In the three months to December 31, the industrial gases manufacturer
made pre-tax profits of #89.4m compared with a previous loss of #8.9m.
The loss was due to restructuring charges of #85m.
Excluding the effect of the charges, profits this year grew by 16%.
Group turnover in the first quarter was 4% higher at #873.7m.
The gases business achieved a 15% increase in operating profit
compared with the same period a year ago, helped by a strong performance
by BOC gases in the US. There was also good trading in its South African
operations but margins remained under pressure in the UK.
Demand continued to grow in most North Pacific markets except Japan
where the earthquake that affected the region around Kobe disrupted
operations. BOC said that immense efforts are continuing to be made to
sustain deliveries of essential supplies to hospitals and other
customers despite severe transport difficulties.
Profits at Ohmeda, its healthcare business, rose by 6.4%. Profits were
boosted by the sale of the Medical Engineering Systems business. Profits
in the pharmaceutical business remained steady although sales of the
Suprane anaesthetic were impacted by equipment modifications.
BOC has said that it intends to redirect its pharmaceuticals research
and development towards inhaled medicines at the expense of its
traditional areas of anaesthesia and operating drugs. Last year, BOC
suffered from the expiry of the US patent on its main anaesthetic
Forane, in spite of the launch of the Suprane replacement.
Vacuum technology and distribution services operating profit advanced
by 31%, continuing the strong growth trend of last year in Edward vacuum
products. This reflects continuing buoyant demand from the world
semiconductor industry.
Going forward BOC should be able to raise the prices of its industrial
gases in line with increases made by some of its rivals. BOC shares
performed strongly in 1994 after a disastrous 1993 when the impact of
loss of patent protection hit pharmaceutical results.
However, with the gases business now recovering, the worst is probably
behind the healthcare division and the valuation probably reasonable for
this stage of the cycle, chemicals analysts at Goldman Sachs expect the
shares to continue to attract support. Yesterday BOC added 2p to 720p.

TOTTENHAM Hotspur's revival on the football pitch has not been passed
on to shareholders in the football club.
It lifted taxable profits to #2.06m in the six months to November 30
from #640,000 in the corresponding period a year earlier.
However, after splashing out millions on international stars, costly
ground improvements and the effects of a #1.5m fine, shareholders are
again not getting an interim dividend.
''Our cash flow position was disrupted by the fine of unprecedented
proportions levied upon the club by the Football Association of #1.5m,''
said chairman Alan Sugar.
''This money would, in ordinary circumstances, have been available for
dividend payments to shareholders or player purchases.''
Spurs was fined for financial irregularities, including alleged
''bungs'' to players in transfer deals. An FA ban on taking part in the
FA Cup and a league points deduction were recently overturned after an
appeal.

<HEADLINE>Telecommunications giant's redundancy costs set to stabilise Benefits ahead for BT</HEADLINE>

THE incredible shrinking workforce of British Telecommunications is
set to stabilise soon, several years earlier than some industry
observers thought likely.
Employee numbers have come down from 215,000 to 145,000 over four
years and the figure for the financial year beginning in April is
expected to be under 10,000. In 1994-95 over 15,000 will depart, more
than the group had anticipated.
Finance director Robert Brace said they hoped that the redundancy
scheme would finish in 1995-96. As he pointed out the workforce could
hardly carry on declining by 15,000-20,000, though there may be further
reductions from time to time.
BT has handled the inevitable scaling back of the workforce caused by
technological advance and increasing efficiency with few major
complaints. It was achieved voluntarily and some employees have found
work elsewhere in the expanding telecommunications industry. The scheme
is officially due to finish in September 1996.
The end of redundancy costs will give a major fillip to profits, given
that the charge came to #368m in the nine months to December and will
top the previously expected #750m for the full year.
BT's profits in the third quarter (to December) were actually lower at
#660m against #698m even after a #33m benefit from a disposal. This
reflected further price cuts. Nine months' profits came to #2153m but on
a comparable basis would have shown a 7% fall at #2045m.
To meet its price cap, inland call prices were reduced by an overall
12% which was only partly mitigated by a 7% increase in call volume. So
revenue from this source declined nearly 5% to #184m. Cheaper weekend
calls were introduced in December 1992, peak rate was abolished last
March, and uniform long-distance call rates came in last September. The
third quarter saw an 8.4% drop in revenue.
International calls recorded 4% volume growth but turnover fell 2.4%
owing to price cuts. Growth is being held back by a decline in transit
traffic.
Exchange line rental revenue was up 4.5% in the nine months, with
price increases largely offset by the light user scheme. Business
connections were up 5.6% and residential connections up 1.1%, despite
competition from cable operators. The number of telephones installed is
now 27 million.
On the costs front these rose 1% in nine months, excluding redundancy
payments. Significant increases in sales related costs were offset by
lower employment expenses and property disposals. Marketing spending
jumped 10.7% to #255m, much of this going on boosting Cellnet. This paid
off as mobile phone turnover soared 43%. The number of users rose 50% to
1,560,000, approaching Vodafone's total.
Figures released by Oftel, the regulatory body, showed that Cable &amp;
Wireless's share of phone revenue edged up one point to 10% in 1993-94,
while BT has at last slipped below 90%. Regulator Don Cruickshank
released the information because he was concerned about the lack of
high-quality information available on the market.
BT remains the colossus of the industry but now Mercury is a positive
giant despite the myriad of tiddlers now in the market. Including cable
operators and various business service providers there are 21 fixed link
operators. There are three mobile phone services.
The third-quarter figures were in line with expectations but there is
some nervousness about the deterioration in relations between BT and Mr
Cruickshank. In his statement BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance notes ''an
increasingly unpredictable regulatory climate''.
The latest manifestation of this is Oftel's proposals to force BT to
publish how it works out fees to charge Mercury and others for access to
its network which they use to deliver their calls. BT accused Oftel of
wanting to acquire new powers which went beyond what were necessary to
render BT's accounting procedures transparent.
Mercury is waging a vociferous campaign to change the system which
will cost it some #60m this year. It argues that it should only have to
pay the marginal cost of BT's provision of services to Mercury rather
than a proportion of the total costs of the network. It is going through
the courts to challenge a ruling by Mr Cruickshank on connection
charges.
The company argues that the Oftel director-general had misinterpreted
the relevant passage in BT's licence. Yesterday it won leave from the
Law Lords to take its case to the courts for a legal interpretation.
Success would be a tremendous shot in the arm for Mercury which has
not been finding the going so easy lately, without being very costly to
BT.
However, the regulatory challenges should not be exaggerated in the
context of the growth market in which BT operates and the potential it
has in Europe as the market there is liberalised.
Cost reduction will slow as the redundancy programme draws to a close
but on the other hand the heavy charge on profits, which has been a
feature for years, will decline.
The shares, up 1[1/2]p at 397[1/2]p, sell at an unjustified small
discount to the market and rest on solid foundations.

HI-TECH pioneer Calluna, which was floated in October, increased
interim turnover by more than 400% to #409,000, as it prepared to feed
the next generation of mini-computers.
However, operating charges of #1.47m in the six months to September
were up 42% on the corresponding period last year because of increased
early stage development costs. The fledgling company's operating loss
was up 11% to #1.06m.
The results from the miniature disc-drive specialist were very closely
in line with projections made in the run-up to flotation. They cover the
period preceding the Glenrothes-based company's Unlisted Securities
Market placing, which raised #10.1m.
At that time, Calluna estimated that it would move into profit in the
late spring or early summer of this year.
Managing director Norman White would not be drawn on the likely timing
of this yesterday, pointing out that it related to the next financial
year, but said: ''Things are moving along the directions that we planned
to have them move.''
However, James Warhurst, of the company's Birmingham-based broker
Albert E Sharp, believes Calluna will move into profit in the second
quarter of its next financial year.
Forecasting a loss of up to #2.5m in the current financial year and a
#4.5m annual profit to March 1996, he said: ''Nobody is expecting
absolutely instant fireworks out of Calluna but, in the general run of
these things, it will be relatively quick.''
When the company was floated on October 31, its shares soared from
their 65p strike price to 92p, boosting the market value of Calluna by
about #15m over the expected #35m price-tag. Yesterday, the shares
closed down 1p on 79p, against the backdrop of a rising market.
One of the company's selling points is undoubtedly the future
potential of the lap-top and notebook computer market, which can use the
patented pocket-sized ''Callunacard'' hard disc-drive.
However, a number of other possible applications in the US, in the
fields of factory automation, and aircraft and motor car monitoring
equipment, as well as printers, have emerged in the last two or three
months.
Calluna, which employs 52 people, also demonstrated prototype versions
of its 260-megabyte disc drive at the Comdex show in Las Vegas in
November. The company has also expanded its European and US sales and
marketing operations.
Since the flotation, Calluna has invested in its supply lines, to
ensure consistent availability of quality components.
Laying the foundations for ''very pleasantly surprising'' levels of
interest, Calluna, which has no bank debt, has also invested in its
general manufacturing operations.
The company believes the benefits of the initial investment of cash
raised from the placing should be realised over the coming months.
October's flotation was three times oversubscribed. Dr White and his
founding directors hold around one-quarter of the total equity, with
institutions and existing private investors owning the rest.
Albert E Sharp, the sponsor broker, predicted an annual turnover of
more than #200m in a few years.

ANOTHER major Chinese success story comes from Babcock International
which has won contracts to supply four coal-fired boilers together worth
about #200m.
With orders gained last month, Babcock now has a base load of
contracts for China totalling about #325m which will guarantee
employment at the Renfrew facility until at least 1998.
The joint consortium with Westinghouse Electric of the US has received
a conditional letter of award from Shandong China Power Company for a
700mw power station at Heze and a 1300mw complex at Liaocheng in
Shandong Province. The total value of the contracts is over $600m, of
which Babcock's share is about $300m.
Other participants include Electricite de France International and
China Light &amp; Power Company of Hong Kong. The deal has still to be
formally concluded and is subject to satisfactory financing and other
conditions.
Managing director of Babcock International Group's Energy Division,
Duncan Cox said that the exact amount of work that will be done in
Renfrew has yet to be decided while design will be shared between
Crawley and Renfrew.
In January, Babcock, in association with Westinghouse and American
engineering consultants Sargant &amp; Lundy, was awarded a contract for two
700mw power stations at Dandong and Dailan in Liaoning Provoince with
the British company's share worth #125m for four boilers.
Mr Cox said that he was bidding for work in India, Vietnam and also in
China but there was nothing firm as yet.
Babcock shares rose [1/2]p to 28p.

<HEADLINE>Visible trade gap grows to #640m</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with the rest of the world grew to #640m
in November after a downward revision from #644m to #553m in October,
much in line with market projections.
The value of total exports in the month was up 3% on October at
#12.1bn, while imports rose 3.5% to #12.7bn.
Both exports and imports are continuing to grow and this is regarded
as bullish in that it indicates that the economy continues on course
although there are also fears that it has been growing too fast, hence
the Chancellor's imposition of interest rate hikes to curb perceived
future inflationary pressures.
For November, the deficit with the EU countries expanded from
October's #132m to #205m with the growth in imports outstripping
exports. The previously reported December deficit for non-EU countries
had shown a significant and unexpected deterioration against market
expectations, albeit this included imports of works of art and
jewellery, regarded as erratic items.
Excluding oil and erratic items, such as ships, aircraft, precious
stones and silver, the volume, as opposed to value, of exports in
November grew by 2% and the volume of exports by 3%. Taking one month's
figures in isolation is always risky, though, as the authorities are
fond of pointing out unless it is particularly favourable one.
Taking the three months to November, the value of exports increased by
3[1/2]% and imports by 3% -- both largely the result of increased trade
with the EU. In volume terms, again excluding oil and erratic items,
exports advanced 5% and imports 3%.
It is difficult to come to any hard and fast conclusions from the
November showing (and December's non-EU outcome) but overall there are
signs that the big improvement in the UK's trade deficit may be
levelling off with exports coming off the boil a little.
But certainly there are no real worries at present. Analysts said that
growth rates did not suggest any major slowdown in the economy at the
end of last year. Industry's export expectations are still high and with
the consumer sector still relatively subdued and higher mortgages and
taxes in the offing, import penetration should be blunted. Sterling's
weakness will also work against imports although this is a two-edged
sword since this increases inflationary pressures.
Trade Minister Richard Needham yesterday welcomed the November trade
figures. He said: ''British companies are continuing to forge ahead
around the world. In November alone Britain's exports were worth #12.1bn
-- the highest ever in any month. This is further evidence of the
strength of the export-led recovery.''

SCOTTISH Television strongly denied suggestions yesterday that Kirsty
Young's early evening chat show is to be cancelled. ''We've done a great
deal to bring her on. She is one of our top personalities. There's no
way we're going to axe her,'' said a senior executive.
The twice-a-week show will run as scheduled until March and a new
series has been pencilled in for the autumn. Ms Young will continue to
front the lunchtime news programme, Scotland Today, in the intervening
period.
However, Scottish is planning to look at the possibility of
rescheduling the next series to a later time. A spokesman said: ''With a
programme which goes out at 5.10pm there are some serious subjects you
cannot tackle because children are watching.''
Press reports earlier this week claimed that, though the viewing
figures for the show were reasonable, it was facing the axe because
Scottish Television considered that the chat show formula was ''worn
out''.
The spokesman added: ''I don't know where this rumour came from, but I
suspect that it is from someone with an axe to grind. There is no truth
in it whatsoever.''

<HEADLINE>Leak reveals Government proposal to change rules on consulting the public. Fears of new move to ease NHS closures</HEADLINE>

EXCLUSIVE
SEPARATE consultation over hospital closures should be abolished,
according to a leaked Scottish Office document.
Health boards have been required since 1975 to undertake public
consultation on proposals to shut specific hospitals.
New arrangements would remove this and amalgamate it into a general
obligation on boards to consult on their three-year purchasing plans.
The Herald has seen details of the proposals which are outlined in a
draft report sent out to board general managers by the director of
purchasing at the Scottish NHS Management Executive.
The revelation comes in the wake of increasing anxiety over the
Government's commitment to genuine public consultation in the NHS.
Earlier this week, The Herald revealed that Mearnskirk Hospital at
Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, is being sold off to developers during the
actual consultation process, and before closure has been approved.
An unprecedented spate of hospital closures is also anticipated over
the next five years as the Government seeks to reshape the service and
cut at least 5000 beds in Scotland.
Labour's Scottish health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, said: ''This is
a most unwelcome development, which we would forcefully resist.
''It is a clear attempt to open up the way for the Government to do
what it likes with hospitals,'' he said.
''Public consultation over three-year plans makes any debate more
diffuse and much less focused. It makes it more difficult for people to
defend their hospitals and easier for boards and trusts to close them,''
the MP for Dundee East added.
A spokeswoman for the British Medical Association said: ''It is a
fundamental right that the public, served by a particular hospital,
should have a say in its future. The present system allows for that
democratic process.
''We would also question the efficacy of a three-year plan to purchase
care for patients, given the rapid change in medical provision,'' she
added.
Mr John Ramage, convener of the Scottish Association of Health
Councils, said he would be concerned if there was any dilution of
consultation.
However, the report stresses the new approach is a sensible and
logical way forward.
''The essence of consultation is the communication of a genuine
invitation to give advice, and a genuine receipt of that advice,''
It was particularly important to consult when purchasing plans had
implications for services, either by shifting to different providers or
withdrawing a service.
Quality of service was also an important issue. ''A board may wish to
shift provision of a service to a facility which is new or unknown to
the public. It needs to be recognised that this may cause uncertainty,
particularly with vulnerable patients,'' the report says.
''Alternatively, a board may wish to purchase a specialist service in
a more distant centre, when it is seen as being safer or more effective
than the service purchased locally.''
After consultation, the board would submit its proposals to the
Management Executive for approval by the Scottish Secretary.
''In giving approval to the plan, Ministers would also endorse any
specific changes in service provision (such as the closure of a
particular hospital) which would result from the purchasing strategy.
There would be no need for further consultation when the actual closure
took place'', according to the report.
It says the new system would take time to implement and was unlikely
to cover purchasing plans beginning this year. Transitional arrangements
would apply in the interim.
''If a board has consulted under the terms of this circular, and its
purchasing plan has been approved by the Management Executive, no
further consultation on hospital closures is needed,'' the report
concludes.

BRITAIN'S largest car dealership group Lex Service is restructuring
its retail operations at a cost of #14.5m which will be charged as an
exceptional itemm in thw 1994 accounts.
This will be more than offset by gains on the sale of properties and
the disposal of businesses. The total saving will be in excess of #4m
annually and with bigger savings comong later.
Some 80 staff, mainly in managerial posts, will lose their jobs.
Of these, 50 of the redundancies will go from its retail group head
office in Bourne End, Bucks, with the rest spread around the UK.
Lex is changing from a franchise-based structure to a more regional
basis. Focusing more on customers' needs was another of the group's
principal aims.
The shares closed 6p weaker at 282p.

BASS has seen a 1.3% fall in beer volumes on a like-for-like basis in
the first 16 weeks of the financial year but the resultant shortfall in
gross profits has been substantially recoved by cost savings and price
increases.
Chairman Sir Ian Prosser told yesterday's annual meeting that there
had been a 3.7% fall in off-trade sales which he blamed partly on
imports from France.
In answer to questions, he pointed out that these now amounted to
production equivalent to the combined output of Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley,
Vaux.
However, Bass is ''unashamedly'' exporting beer to France where the
local duty is just one seventh of that paid in the UK and then brought
back to Britain by tourist and other purchasers.
Executive remuneration was the major topic of the meeting with Sir Ian
stating that the attitude of the press to pay in the UK was ''quite
wrong'' as Bass is increasingly competing for top management resource.
His total package including pension contributions rose last year from
#615,000 to #707,000 although over the last three years, the total cost
of the Bass board had risen by just 1%.
The remuneration committee includes Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy of Kingfisher
who received #1.3m last year.

DIRECT Line, the biggest motor insurer in the UK, will open the
telephone lines to its customers interested in buying its new life
insurance products from next Wednesday.
Around 1.5 million existing motor and household policyholders have
been sent details of a range of life insurance products under Direct
Line's income protection plan, the parent Royal Bank of Scotland said
yesterday.
''We expect there to be quite heavy demand at the beginning,'' a
spokesman said, adding that initial levels of customer interest in the
company's move into life insurance had been encouraging.
The products, including term assurance, mortgage protection, family
income cover, disability cover and whole life policies, will initially
only be available to Direct Line customers.
The company, a pioneer in the field of telephone insurance, has no
immediate plans for media advertising and will ''cold call'' potential
customers.
Direct Line rose to No 1 private motor insurer in 10 years from launch
with a successful telephone marketing formula, which cut the cost of
insurance for many motorists. In the process, it made its founder, Peter
Wood, a fortune.

<HEADLINE>Oil leaking from Scapa wreck of the Royal Oak</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>17</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979927342</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A BATTLESHIP sunk 55 years ago in Scapa Flow is posing a serious
danger of pollution.
It is feared that oil escaping from HMS Royal Oak, torpedoed by the
German submarine U-47 in October 1939, could kill thousands of seabirds.
The hull is starting to break up, with the possibility that tanks
could burst releasing hundreds of tons of oil.
Royal Navy divers are inspecting the Royal Oak, an official war grave.
She went down with the loss of 831 men.
David Mitchell, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said
yesterday: ''This has come as complete news to me. I hadn't appreciated
there was now a slick two or three miles long from the wreck.
''If there was a sudden rupture, you could be talking about major
pollution and the loss of seabirds -- divers, auks, and sea ducks.''
Mr Mitchell added that the situation highlighted the problem of vast
quantities of highly toxic waste, including mustard gas, that was dumped
off Northern Ireland and the west coast of Scotland after the Second
World War.
A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council said: ''The hull is now in a
dangerous condition and it could go almost any time.''
Every October, a Remembrance service is held above the wreck and a
White Ensign replaced on the ship's superstructure during the annual
inspection.
Diving on the Royal Oak, in 27 metres of water, is banned to everyone
but the Royal Navy. It was during the last inspection that the hull was
found to be disintegrating.
When the Royal Oak went down, she was carrying about 3500 tons of
fuel. ''The spot where the ship went down can be seen from the air
because of the oily sheen on the surface,'' said the council spokesman.
Salvage teams are considering pumping the oil out of the tanks to a
barge before safe disposal.
The technique was used on a German wreck lying in 90 metres of water
off the Norwegian coast last year.

SCOTTISH Mutual, the life office arm of the Abbey National Bank, is
holding its annual bonus rate for the life unitised with profits fund at
7.5% but the pension annual bonus rate has been marginally reduced from
10% to 9.5% where it remains high competitive.
All other rates of reversionary bonus declared for 1994 remain at the
interim rate applied during the year. However, additional terminal
bonuses, paid at the time the policy matures, have been lowered in line
with the industry.
The effect of the changes are illustrated through a male non-smoker
paying #50-a-month premium and aged 30 next birthday at the time of
taking out a policy maturing on March 31, 1995. Over 10 years the payout
would be #10,799, a 5.7% decline on the #11,463 paid on March 31, 1994,
but still a return of 11.3% per annum against an average rate of
inflation of 4.9% over the period.
For a 25-year policy term the payout would be #101,386 against
#105,580 last year, a return of 13.1% per annum against inflation of
8.8%.
Scottish Mutual's chief executive Andrew Pople said: ''It is
encouraging that we have been able to maintain our reversionary bonus
despite current stock market conditions.
''While there has been a slight decrease in maturity values for
policies maturing on or after March 1, payouts on traditional policies
still represent excellent returns which, when viewed in the context of
low levels of inflation, are more than competitive with other forms of
personal savings.''

ONE of the three men accused of murdering a 63-year-old retired mining
engineer moments after a #185,000 bank robbery was only the getaway
driver, his defence counsel said yesterday.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, counsel for Mr Paul Bootland, told the jury in
the Bonnyrigg trial that he was making no attempt to conceal his
client's role in the crime.
''My position on behalf of Mr Bootland is that he was the driver of
the getaway car in this robbery and as such never left the getaway car
during the course of this robbery.''
Mr Bootland, 25, is alleged to have robbed the Bank of Scotland in
High Street, Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on October 19 last year with Mr
Robert Smith, 33, and Mr Gerald McQuade, 40.
The three deny murdering Mr David Dunn by shooting him in a car park
near the bank.
They are also accused of attempting to murder Police Constable John
Duffy and two other men, Mr John Girdler and Mr Duncan Milliken, by
presenting a loaded gun at them and repeatedly discharging it.
Mr Findlay made Mr Bootland's position clear as he questioned Mr Peter
Reid, 29, a financial consultant with the Bank of Scotland in Bonnyrigg.
Mr Reid said that as he drove past in his car on the day of robbery he
saw two men standing talking in the High Street.
He had a clear view of one man, who was about six feet tall with
short, dark hair and wearing a green nylon bomber jacket.
Asked if he could identify the man, he said he could not be sure but
the man resembled Mr Bootland.
He agreed with Mr Findlay that if it was the case that Mr Bootland was
the getaway driver and had never left the car, he might be mistaken
about having seen him in the street.
Earlier, a bank customer, Mr Donald McBride, of Moffat Avenue,
Bonnyrigg, told the court how he had been speaking to a teller when he
noticed ''a look of horror'' on her face.
He turned and saw a man pointing a gun in his face and another man
hustling a Securicor guard to the back of the bank. He was ordered to
lie on the floor and after the raiders left he walked out in a state of
shock.
Mr Kevin Addison, personal banking manager at the Bonnyrigg branch,
said he had been warned that he would be ''blasted'' if he moved.
The trial contiues.

A TEENAGE mother, her two children, and a friend's baby daughter, died
yesterday when flames swept through a house in Annan, Dumfriesshire.
Friends and neighbours tried to save them but were beaten back by
thick smoke and intense heat as the fire spread upstairs from the living
room of the terraced council house in Shawhill Court.
As a fire investigation team and police forensic experts sifted
through the charred wreckage of the house it emerged that the fire may
have started when clothes drying in front of a gas fire caught light.
The victims were named as Ms Elizabeth McPhillips, 17, her
19-month-old daughter Sarah and eight-month-old son John, and
six-month-old Sophie Reid who had been staying overnight.
Sophie's mother, Ms Sharon Reid, of the town's Westgill, escaped from
the fire with her son, Steffan, 2.
Ms Reid, who was treated for shock and the effects of smoke
inhalation, said last night: ''I had spent the night at Elizabeth's with
my two children and we were sleeping on a sofa in the living room.
Suddenly I was wakened by Steffan who had been lying on my knee. He was
choking and could hardly breathe.
''The room was on fire and there was smoke everywhere, I grabbed
Steffan and the next minute the flames were right through the house.''
Ms Reid continued: ''I shouted to neighbours there was a fire and
people were still in there then I tried to get back into the house
because I knew my baby and Elizabeth and her kids were trapped. I got so
far into the house but was beaten back by the flames which singed my
hair. There was nothing we could do, it was terrible.''
Ms Reid said smoke alarms were fitted in the house but she did not
hear them go off.
Immediate neighbour, Mr Jason Fairbairn, 20, got into the hallway of
the house and was approaching the living room when he heard a bang and
saw a fireball coming towards him.
The dairyman said: ''I could hear the lassie screaming for help but
there was nothing we could do.''
Senior officials of Annandale and Eskdale District Council expressed
their concern at the tragedy and stressed that smoke detectors are
fitted in all council properties.
A report is being prepared for the procurator-fiscal at Dumfries.

Ross Finlay road tests the BMW 316i Compact
ONE thing to beware of is the judgment occasionally seen in test
reports that some car or other could easily handle more power. To
somebody like myself who is quite happy with an excess of handling
capability over power output, it does not make much sense. Certainly,
engineers can work wonders in that line. The snag is that the process
usually involves stiffer suspension, deteriorated ride quality and a
clumsier feel through the steering.
One of the most powerful production saloons I have driven had
tremendous traction and could corner like nothing on earth. But you
simply could not leave it alone for an instant. There was no relaxation
in driving it, it jerked all over the place on any but billiard-table
surfaces, and it would ''tramline'' into any tarmac grooves. I hated it.
The car in question was not a BMW, but many critics applaud the most
powerful and most expensive of these Munich designs. However, I have
recently enjoyed a couple of the entry-level models, cars with no
pretensions about their flat-out performance.
As a result, they were pleasant and straightforward to drive, and they
put that covetable badge within the same price range as much more
mundane rivals. The 316i Compact comes at a showroom price of #13,350. I
drove one car on local roads, many of them with variable surfaces and up
in the hills. The other slogged 1000 miles or so to Gatwick and back.
The two-door Compact looks good, even if the purplish exterior of one
example was not entirely ''me''. There are definite cost-cutting
measures involved, not all of them visible. Interior trim materials are
obviously specified down to a price. The rear suspension is of an older
and simpler design than is fitted to the rest of the current 3-series
cars.
Its engine is simple too. The 316i uses a 1596cc eight-valve unit
which peaks at 102bhp. It will sprint to 60mph in a leisurely -- by BMW
standards -- 12 seconds, offers modest torque and flexibility, and will
reach a test track maximum around 116mph . Fuel returns are about 49mpg
at 56mph, 37 at 75 and 31mpg on the urban cycle.
The 316i Compact is not lavishly equipped. There are several
extra-cost option packs and individual items of equipment, but how much
sense would it make to buy a rock-bottom BMW model and then load it with
extras? While the standard driver's airbag means that the steering wheel
does not adjust for height, the driver's seat does. Normally, I do not
approve of that mixture, but it worked well enough this time. As so
often with German cars, I thought the wheel could have been a couple of
inches smaller.
Not having to worry about putting down vast amounts of power, this
Compact has top-class ride standards. On the other hand, I thought the
way the car cornered and handled generally was excellent too. Some of us
still like the rear-wheel drive layout which is not usual in this size
of car today. While it may lack the pin-point finesse in tight corners
which comes with the best FWD designs, that makes little difference to
people who are travelling at brisk but legal speeds.
The long motorway journeys showed that the Compact is a relaxed
cruiser, with low noise levels and, in the front cabin anyway, a
spacious feel. Some of the earliest examples of the present 3-series
cars were a let-down in build quality, to the extent that Munich seemed
to have started to drift into the old ''Friday afternoon at the
factory'' syndrome. There was none of that with either of the Compacts I
tried.
A haul up the M6 in snow and high winds made me relieved that even
this entry-level BMW comes with ABS as standard. In weather conditions
of the kind which often make driving miserable, the stability and sense
of being in a properly engineered car were pretty cheering.

NATIONAL Express is continuing its drive to become an integrated
transport group rather just a coach operator.
It is paying #7.1m for Bournemouth airport. National Express already
owns East Midlands airport, acquired for #27.1m in July 1993, and has
declared an interest in Birmingham and Cardiff airports.
The Bournemouth acquisition is expected to be marginally earnings
dilutive initially. This is because National Express intends to fund the
airport's development from internal resources. It sees the deal as a
chance to develop a profitable, well-sited regional airport.
The company running Bournemouth airport made a post-tax profit of
#79,000 in 1994. The airport handled about 160,000 passengers in the
nine months to December 31, which was a 50% rise over the same period in
1993. Bournemouth airport handles short-haul domestic and international
scheduled flights as well as charters.
National Express sees scope to develop the airport as an attractive
option to handle the overspill from other congested airports in
South-east England, notably Heathrow and Gatwick. In addition it hopes
to increase the airport's appeal as a significant charter and cargo
airport serving the large and growing south coast conurbations nearby.
Alongside its coach and airport interests, National Express is also
closely monitoring opportunities which may arise out of the
privatisation of British Rail. It makes commercial sense for the
company, Britain's largest inter-city coach company, to keep an eye on
rivals in the transport market.
Alastair Dick, the company's director of group planning, thinks it
would be theoretically possible to have a rail service within our
portfolio''. Mr Dick says that the company is a firm believer in ''the
advantages of integrated intermodal transport''.
News of its latest acquisition drove National Express shares up 9p to
319p.

A GLASGOW housing association has become the first to be criticised
for maladministration by the Housing Association Ombudsman for Scotland.
Mr John Richards has ruled that the Govanhill Housing Association was
incompetent and has recommended that a couple who complained to him
should be paid #500 compensation.
He upheld their complaint the association was wrong in freezing their
application to transfer to more suitable accommodation.
It had imposed a blanket ban on transfers because of vandalism in the
common back-court area adjoining their home and excluded the couple, who
are not named in the judgment, from a committee meeting which heard
their case.
Mr Richards said in his report, issued yesterday, that the couple were
unfairly stigmatised by an assumption that they had supported
anti-social behaviour.
He recommended his finding be reported to the association's management
committee.
The Ombudsman service for housing association tenants was set up last
year to investigate complaints from those who claim to have suffered
personal injustice as a result of bad, inefficient, or improper
administration.
Since last spring, 90 formal complaints have been received throughout
Scotland.
The couple, living in a three-bedroom ground floor flat, had
complained the association was wrong to freeze their application for
transfer in a situation which was unfair and unreasonable.
They had been accused in an open letter sent to them and neighbours of
supporting anti-social behaviour ''by association''.
The Ombudsman's finding was that the association's administration of
the ban was faulty in relation to widely accepted standards of good
practice and its own published procedures.

<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS from the Scottish Agricultural College and Edinburgh
University have concluded that the public is confused in its attitudes
to organic food, the Prince of Wales will be told today during a visit
to the SAC's Sustainable Farming Systems Initiative at Craibstone
Estate, near Aberdeen.
A major study has found that in addition to public confusion there are
problems of low volume, inefficient distribution, slow turnover and high
wastage.
It suggests that given the right marketing strategies there are growth
opportunities in fruit, vegetables and new meat products. On-farm
processing may be possible for some producers, especially where there is
access to local or specialised markets.
The economists see any major expansion, however, coming in off-farm
processing for export and for supermarkets where the market could expand
to more than #100m.
For this market to take off, producers must be able to provide regular
supplies of quality produce, at the right price, properly certified,
labelled and packaged, said the study. ''Only then will they be able to
make some inroads on high raw material costs and retail prices which
impede growth in these sectors.''
The aim of sustainable farming is described as ''to develop food
production systems that sustain the rural environment with minimal
demand on non-renewable resources.''

string of deals and provide funds for future acquisitions, ''which could
involve a total cost of approximately #30m.''
In the past two years, Manchester-based BTP bought struggling fellow
chemicals group MTM and six other smaller firms for #27m. BTP has just
bought a plant in Ruabon, north Wales, for #3.5m used for making key raw
materials for cosmetics and toiletries.
Funds from the cash call will eliminate net borrowings currently
standing at #49m.
On current prospects, chairman John Ketteley said: ''Trading has been
encouraging in a challenging environment. Progress has been made in
obtaining price increases necessitated by the rising cost of raw
materials.''

THE first licensing board in Scotland to impose a ban preventing the
drinking of bottled beers and cider ''from the neck'' in an effort to
reduce violence in bars and cut down litter on streets, has decided to
review its position.
Ettrick and Lauderdale District Licensing Board yesterday agreed to
relax the ban until October, following a meetingwith the licensed trade.
Borders licensees had pointed out the effects of the ban on profit
margins and the difficulties explaining the system to customers.
The ban was imposed two years ago and the board was advised that there
had been a drop in incidents on licensed premises and in the number of
bottles collected in the streets.
It will now monitor the position.

THE Scottish Office moved last night to clarify the basis on which
ScotRail would be privatised, as the row over the future of Motorail and
Fort William sleeper services in Scotland intensified at Westminster.
The attack was led by SNP parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing, who
demanded that the Government should explain exactly where it stood.
After the exchanges at the Scottish Grand Committee on Wednesday, she
called on Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro ''to give a clear
and unequivocal commitment that the railway lines discussed at
yesterday's committee will continue to operate and that a full, formal
consultation will take place.''
Mrs Ewing, MP for Moray, is concerned that the Government is
backtracking on the commitment apparently given by Sir Hector on
Wednesday, when he spoke of ''formal'' consultation on the future of
Motorail and the Fort William sleepers.
The SNP spokesperson said last night that Sir Hector regarded himself
as a man of honour, and must honour the commitment he had given, but the
Scottish Office last night gave its own version of events.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''The franchising director is
expected to publish the proposed passenger service requirement for
ScotRail in May. He has indicated that he does not intend to include the
Fort William and Carlisle sleeper services, nor Motorail, in the
proposed PSR.
''Following publication of the PSR, there will be a formal process of
consultation with the Rail Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland
and local authorities, before final decisions on the PSR are known. The
PSR provides a basis on which ScotRail will, in due course, be
franchised.
''The consultation process will be carried out by the franchising
director in accordance with guidance issued to him by the Secretary of
State for Transport, under the provisions of the Railways Act, 1993.
This is the process of consultation to which Ministers were referring
during debate in the Scottish Grand Committee on February 8.''
The spokesman added: ''In the meantime, any decision to withdraw
sleeper or Motorail services in advance of this consultation process
would be a commercial decision for British Rail.''
It was made clear that at a meeting with Liberal Democrat Charles
Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, and a delegation of interested
parties on Wednesday, Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton had undertaken to ''ask BR to consider maintaining
present services, at least until after the consultation process and
final decisions on the PSR had been taken.''
The Lib Dems yesterday called on Rail Regulator John Swift to enforce
the statutory requirement for consultation before services are cut. They
backed their call with an Early Day Motion noting assurances that formal
consultation will take place had been given by Ministers in the Scottish
Grand Committee on Wednesday.
Mr Kennedy said: ''The rail regulator must now intervene, using his
designated powers under the Railways Act, to instruct the franchise
director to re-include the Fort William and Carlisle sleeper services,
as well as Motorail, in the Passenger Service Requirements consultation
process.''
Meanwhile, more than 200 protesters thronged Fort William railway
station yesterday, and stopped traffic outside as part of the campaign
to save the Motorail and sleeper services to the town.
As the uncertainty continued over whether there is to be a temporary
reprieve for the services, people came from all over Lochaber to
demonstrate their opposition to the proposed cuts.
Pipers, a wind band, and dozens of placards greeted rail travellers to
and from Fort William. The demonstration then moved out to the main road
where cars were stopped and leaflets distributed, all with the full
co-operation of the police. The protesters then marched through the
town.
Later, Fort William councillor Iain MacDonald, said: ''This has been
our first piece of direct action and we could easily return to it unless
we can persuade the powers that be that our rail services must be
reprieved.
''I wouldn't rule out civil disobedience. They really must realise how
seriously we take this issue, and the damage the loss of the services
could do to our local economy.''
Dr Michael Foxley, councillor for Mallaig, Ardnamurchan and the Small
Isles, said: ''The turnout today demonstrates the depth of feeling
within the community about the threat to our rail services. There are
people here who have travelled down from Mallaig and Arisaig to give
their support. We will keep this campaign going because what is being
proposed is madness.''
In Inverness, the convener of Highland Regional Council, Mr Duncan
McPherson, called on Rail Franchise Director Roger Salmon to think again
about axing the services, as a result of the intervention of a Scottish
Office Minister earlier in the week.
Mr McPherson said that Mr Salmon was duty bound to honour the
guarantee given by Sir Hector in the Scottish Grand Committee debate.

GOOD temper and moderation are the characteristics of parliamentary
behaviour.' Now there's a claim. Why not just add that MPs are at all
times sober, chaste, clean, wise as Socrates, and honest as the cheque
is long? Bound to get a laugh.
The words were uttered, with every appearance of sincerity, by Betty
Boothroyd, Speaker of the Commons, and a woman who really ought to know
better. Each week the poor soul presides over the mother of septic tanks
with the jaunty air of one wearing asbestos gloves, lead shielding, and
nose plugs. Yet when obliged to sedate a member foaming like Cremola she
sounds as if she's lecturing primary one on road safety.
This column takes a view on parliamentary language. The real problem,
it seems to this spectator, is not that MPs are mindlessly abusive but
that they are forbidden ever to say what they really mean within the
chamber. Edinburgh's Nigel Griffiths calls a dolt a nitwit and the world
reacts as though he's just produced a steaming veal piece. The Prime
Minister labels the leader of the Opposition a dimwit and no-one guesses
that John has been spending too long in front of the mirror. Dimwit;
nitwit: outrageous.
Yet this is not how people talk. This is not how people think. This is
not, you can bet, what Griffiths and Major really meant. But lest they
want Betty to send them off to stand in a corner they must behave like
infants pretending they really don't know any bad words.
Small wonder, however, given such stout resistance to reality, that
MPs exposed to the outside world react like Forrest Gump on a bad day.
If there's a wrong thing to be said at the wrong time in the wrong
place, our parliamentarians are ready, willing, and incapable. It's the
way they're brought up: poor sods just don't know any better.
Step forward, then (but check that your shoelaces are tied and your
flies are done up) Steven Norris, the minister irresponsible for
transport in the great city of London. Mr Norris is a national treasure,
no doubt about it.
Who else but the man whose job it is to get the huddled masses to and
from work could publicly pour scorn on anyone stupid enough to use a bus
or a train? Who else but the man paid to ensure that there are buses and
trains in the first place could admit that they constitute an experience
so hideous no sane person would want to go near them?
Thus Norris, in praise of the internal combustion engine, to the
Commons inquiry into vehicle exhaust pollution: ''You have your own
company, your own temperature control, your own music, and you don't
have to put up with dreadful human beings sitting alongside you.''
(There follows a moment's silence while dreadful human beings
everywhere contemplate the tragedy of Steven Norris in his own company.)
But is this not a dimwit of the pure stock? Is not the average nit
actually blessed with more wit?
Most of us recognise public transport as a trial. The abiding question
of any stray visitor to London is how on earth anyone there puts up with
it. Mr Norris has now let slip the reasons for this calamity: it has to
do with men in chauffeur-driven cars with a bottomless contempt for the
electorate and neither use for nor interest in the transport
infrastructure unless it eases the limo on its way.
Isherwood got it wrong: Mr Norris doesn't change trains. Mr Norris and
his like don't care about trains, buses or any of the other things the
little people use to get around. Logically, if these people did know or
care they might have done something about the horrors that ensue when
you buy a ticket. If they did have any interest they would not be
dismembering the rail network or ploughing useless motorways through
irreplaceable woodlands.
But be fair: Mr Norris has thought hard about all of this, and
thinking, as his colleagues will doubtless tell you, is very like work.
As he informed the Commons committee: ''A sad misapprehension has been
created that what you need to solve pollution is to get central
government to spend a lot of money on a metro system.''
It stands to reason: who could expect the Government to spend fortunes
on trains when it is fully occupied spending fortunes on motorways like
the gorgeous and ever-expanding M25 in a sincere and carefully conceived
effort to reduce atmospheric poisons? Still, perhaps in the fine,
analytic brain of Mr Norris we discern the outlines of new Tory
thinking. Now we begin to understand the real obstacle to Britain's
recovery: it's the people, stupid,  dreadful human beings and their
ceaseless demands for schools and health care and jobs and a transport
system. Just abolish them and watch the good times roll. At least the
roads wouldn't be so damnably congested.

THE steadily increasing gap between rich and poor in Britain is at its
widest for 50 years, leaving millions of families marginalised, an
independent report has found.
The report, the result of a year-long study by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation, says social and economic reforms are needed. It calls for
tax cuts to be targeted at the lower paid.
Its findings will be seized on by Labour this morning. In a speech in
Edinburgh, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown will promise a ''new
campaign'' against poverty and unemployment.
He will tell the National Local Government Forum Against Poverty that
rising poverty and unemployment are dividing Britain and making the
economy under-perform.
Mr Brown will say: ''Britain should be shocked and galvanised this
morning into action by the scale of poverty and unemployment in our
midst.''
However, he is not expected to endorse the report's call for tax cuts
for the low-paid.
Members of the Rowntree panel that compiled the study include Mr John
Monks, TUC general secretary, and Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general. Both served in a personal capacity.
The team was chaired by Sir Peter Barclay, former chairman of the
Government's Social Security Advisory Committee, who described widening
income inequality as the ''gravest public concern''.
The report warned that millions of families were being denied a stake
in Britain's future prosperity because of widening inequalities. This
trend, although not an international one, has been the case in the
majority of industrialised countries.
However, the report said the pace at which inequality increased in the
UK was faster than in any other country except New Zealand.
It warned: ''In many areas of the UK the living standards and life
opportunities of the poorest are simply unaccceptably low in a society
as rich as ours.
''The falling relative incomes of the poorest are a concern, whether
or not they reach or exceed a particular absolute standard of some years
ago.''
Contrary to popular belief, there has been no trickle-down of wealth.
In contrast to any previous post-war period, as many as the poorest 30%
have failed to benefit from economic growth, the study found.
Furthermore, the incomes of those dependent on social security
benefits have fallen further behind those of the working population
since the early 1980s. Launching the report, Mr Davies and Mr Monks
issued a joint call for more education and training to help the jobless.
Mr Monks said: ''Everyone knows the rich are getting richer and the
poor are getting poorer. It cannot be allowed to continue. Training and
education are the key to helping employees get fairer rewards, and
enabling those with no jobs to stand a better chance of getting out of
unemployment.''
Mr Davies said: ''We need a strategy which goes with the grain of
these global changes. But that needs to involve an even more intense
effort to upgrade our national skills base.''

<HEADLINE>Coal farm sales go ahead British Coal seen softening its stance against tenant farmers</HEADLINE>

EDINBURGH solicitors firm McClure Naismith Anderson &amp; Gardiner has
been appointed by British Coal to undertake the legal work in the
forthcoming sale of land and farms now considered surplus to
requirements.
In Scotland the bulk of the sale will comprise about 20,000 acres of
farmland. Tenant farmers who wish to bid for the properties they
currently occupy have until Friday of next week to register an interest.
Mr David Scobbie, who farms on British Coal land near Tillicoultry,
said yesterday that many of the farmers involved had felt frustrated at
the difficulty in pursuing their interest in purchase with British Coal.
Initial indications had been that no sales to tenant farmers would be
considered but that stance has now been softened. Farms which are
considered to have development potential will not be offered to tenants,
however, and will be marketed on a commercial basis.
British Coal have written to 45 tenants asking them to indicate if
they are interested in purchasing their holdings. So far 36 have
confirmed an interest. A further 14 have been informed that they will
not be eligible to purchase because their land is considered to have
development potential. It is understood the most likely development
would be housing.
In some cases British Coal might be willing to sell off parcels of
land for development but such a split up could affect the viability of
the remaining land as a farming unit.
Farmers who are displaced by the sale of land to a third party would
normally be liable to receive compensation under the terms of their
agricultural lease.
Perth-based chartered surveyor Bell-Ingram has begun a series of farm
visits and inspections which will allow them to arrive at prices for
individual properties.
Solicitor Alan Simpson, one of the partners in McClure Naismith's
Edinburgh office, said that the sale would be a major legal exercise.
''There will be many potential development sites being sold,'' he said.
''There will be many excellent opportunities for purchasers.''
British Coal has said it hope to see the selling process under way
next month and they are looking for completion by the spring of next
year.
* TENANT farmers on the Black Isle who are concerned at the cost of
going to arbitration over rent increases proposed by their landlord --
Scarborough-based Broadland Properties -- have derived little comfort
from Parliamentary answers given by the Scottish Office Agriculture
Minister, Sir Hector Monro.
In response to a series of questions put by Ross, Cromarty and Skye
Liberal-Democrat MP Charles Kennedy, Sir Hector indicated that it was a
matter for the farmers themselves how they wished to be represented at
arbitration hearings.
One farmer has complained that professional advice, legal
representation and arbitration fees had cost him #60,000 -- many times
the rent increase which was in dispute.
Mr Kennedy said: ''The Scottish Office has studiously avoided
answering my specific question as to what assessment they have made of
the costs involved and I will be returning to them on that issue.''
He pointed out that farm arbitrations now seemed to be skewed towards
the use of chartered surveyors and against the use of farmers,
auctioneers and valuers.

SERVICES on the flood-damaged Argyle rail line in Glasgow will not
return to normal until at least October, it was confirmed yesterday.
However, the delay is being utilised by Strathclyde Regional Council to
carry out a #2m upgrading of the devastated Glasgow Central low level
and Argyle Street stations.
More than #4m of damage was caused to the Argyle line in December when
the worst floods for many years surged through the tunnels, knocking out
signalling equipment and marooning two trains at Central low level. The
water, polluted with sewage and oil, was 12ft deep in some places.
Railtrack has confirmed the damage costs will not fall on the council.
However, Strathclyde's roads and transportation chairman Charles
Gordon said the council had drawn up plans for the #2m upgrading of
Central low level and Argyle Street stations prior to the flood.
He said it made sense to carry out these improvements while the
stations were closed for repairs to signalling and tracks.
The council will also be spending #75,000 on re-opening the high level
station platforms at Rutherglen which has been without a service
following closure of the low-level Argyle line.

STRATHCLYDE councillors have serious doubts about the funding of a
major Strathclyde rail project after being told that the estimated costs
had doubled.
Preliminary feasibility work on the CrossRail project, which would
link Glasgow north and south electric services, had originally brought a
ScotRail estimate of #38m.
But following transfer of the railway infrastructure to Railtrack as
part of the Government's privatisation legislation, the estimate has
doubled to almost #77m.
Councillor Charles Gordon, the region's roads and transport chairman,
said this put a question mark over the ability of the future passenger
transport authority to fund the project.
He declared: ''It is unprecedented for a local authority to be told
that the estimate it had been given before enactment of the Railways Act
in April 1994 has now doubled.
''We just don't go and get more money. The amount we are allowed to
borrow is controlled by the Government. Even if they double the
borrowing consent for this project, we would be faced with the revenue
impact of double the loan charges.''
Councillor Gordon warned that the ''chickens were now coming home to
roost'' in terms of an unfolding piece of legislation that the
Government was trying to redefine and re-interpret on a daily basis.
''Every time they address one problem, another one springs up. It's a
shambles,'' he said.
Meanwhile Strathclyde region is maintaining its threat to withhold
around #1m in payments to ScotRail unless it is compensated for loss of
services during last year's signalmen's strike.
ScotRail and Railtrack are locked in a contractual dispute over the
issue, but Strathclyde feels it has a moral claim to compensation in
respect of the services it subsidises.

FOUR sites in Lothian where a roll-on/roll-off ferry terminal could be
established to connect Scotland with mainland Europe have been
identified in a feasibility study.
The sites are at Leith Docks (where capital costs would be #7m), the
Musselburgh/ Prestongrange area at Prestonpans (#33m), Cockenzie Power
Station (#38m), and Skateraw, near Torness Power Station, (#72m).
The study, details of which were released yesterday in Edinburgh, was
conducted by Halcrow Fox, consultants, for four sponsors -- Lothian
Regional Council, Edinburgh District, East Lothian District, and Lothian
and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (LEEL).
Councillor Keith Geddes, leader of Lothian Regional Council, said all
the sites had strengths and weaknesses.
The study results would now be examined and a further report would be
made in due course, he added.
Councillor George Wanless, chairman of East Lothian District Council,
said a ferry terminal would provide a boost to the Scottish economy and
particularly to tourism.
All four sites could be eligible for financial assistance from the
European Union.
Leith would have the lowest development cost but the journey time
could limit the frequency of service.
Musselburgh/ Prestongrange and Cockenzie would each require new
breakwaters and a dredged shipping channel.
Skateraw would need extensive engineering works, including two
breakwaters of up to half a mile long.

Cindy Crawford is to put more pep into Pepsi's promo. But, before
advertisers think they can now settle back and live life to the max,
Deedee Cuddihy conducts a test that could have them fizzing.
PICTURE the scene: you're at the shops and notice some cans of cola
going cheap at 25p each. ''Aha'', you say to yourself, ''this will do
for that sullen-faced, teenage toe-rag who was skulking in his room, as
usual, hunched over a computer game when he heard me going out the door
and yelled 'Get me a Coke!'''
Laden like a pack horse, you trudge home and are unloading the
messages on to the kitchen counter when Mr Nasty shuffles through and
asks if you need any help.
No, that last part is a joke. Of course your son doesn't offer to
help. Instead he says, ''Did you get me a Coke?'' and when you point to
the cans (they were such a bargain you had to get 12) which are printed
with phrases like, ''genuine American taste'', he shrieks, ''That's not
Coke!'' and retreats in a huff, to his bedroom -- slamming as many doors
as possible on the way.
I'm sure that little scene would have gladdened the heart of the
Coca-Cola Company (whose registered trademarks by the way include the
word Coke as well as the hyphen between the Coca and the Cola, who have,
after all, been telling us for years that Coke is ''The Real Thing''.
Many people, parents in particular, claim that there is no appreciable
difference in taste between the dozen or so cola drinks that can
currently be bought at retail outlets across the country.
Our teenagers' insistence on expensive brand names, they argue, just
demonstrates how they have been ''got at'' by manufacturers who spend
millions on clever advertising campaigns (note, however, that the very
people who insist that a Coke is just a cola may refuse to drink any
instant coffee other than Nescafe, on the grounds that cheaper makes,
whether they've tried them or not, are inferior).
But is Coca-Cola popular simply because of the way it has been
promoted? The product has, after all, been around since 1886, it's the
best-selling fizzy drink in the UK where #400m worth is consumed
annually and is also our number one best-selling grocery brand (Nescafe,
the world's first instant coffee, launched over 50 years ago, comes in
at number four).
Pepsi, with sales here totalling less than half of Coca-Cola's, is
Britain's second most popular soft drink. The two companies have
reportedly been at loggerheads for almost a century, ever since Mr Caleb
Bradham, also (like the creator of Coke) a pharmacist from the southern
states of America, decided to make his own cola some 12 years after the
invention of the original.
Despite massive sales and world-wide recognition, Pepsi and Coke have
been considerably shaken up by the recent appearance in Britain of
several rival American-style colas. Pepsi, in particular, has been so
disturbed by developments in the UK that the company decided to hold
last month's international press preview of its forthcoming advertising
campaign in London, rather than the United States.
The ads, which will start appearing next month, star super-model Cindy
Crawford and are what the trade call ''comparative in style''. This
means that, rather than merely alluding to rival brands (''You're not
going to make him drink that stuff, are you?'' asks the waitress in an
old Pepsi ad, referring to an unnamed cola), actors will be shown
holding bottles of Coke and viewers will be given the impression that
while Coke may be the preferred beverage of dreary, boring slobs, people
who want a bit of glamour in their lives drink Pepsi.
Coca-Cola has responded by helping to fund a commercial laboratory on
the US space shuttle Discovery. It's been reported that the astronauts
are going to help them in their search for a longer-lasting fizz.
Back on earth, however, there are more mundane matters to attend to
like organising a cola taste test for The Herald with a group of four
secondary school pupils and an equal number of, allegedly less
discerning, primary school kids.
Six brands of cola were on trial: Pepsi, Safeway Regular Select Cola,
Pepsi Max, Coca-Cola, Solripe American Cola, and Virgin Cola with prices
ranging from 38p a can to 20p (for the Solripe).
The questions asked were: Which cola do you like best? and Can you
name them?
Our secondary school testers were Bruni, Ossian, Ambika, and Tom.
Before the test, Bruni said she preferred Pepsi Max; Ambika, Coca-Cola;
Ossian, Pepsi Max -- or Irn Bru, and Tom, Coca-Cola. All said they had
seen adverts for cola but claimed not to have been influenced by them.
First into the paper cups was Brand A, the Pepsi which two testers
guessed was Virgin and all thought a trifle flat. Three testers thought
that Brand B was the Safeway cola and they were right, they all liked
it.
Everyone guessed, correctly, that Brand C was Pepsi Max (which is
artificially sweetened) and it was given the thumbs-up by Bruni and
Ossian who drink it regularly.
Three testers thought that Brand D was the Coke, which it was,
although Tom who drinks at least one a day, wasn't sure.
However, he correctly guessed that Brand E was the Solripe cola and
pronounced it ''totally sad''. The other three thought it was Pepsi and
didn't like it either.
Brand F was the Virgin cola which three testers said was Solripe and
Tom thought was Pepsi. None was impressed.
Overall, the Safeway Regular Select Cola was liked the best and
Solripe American cola the least.
Afterwards, Tom and Ossian said they might be tempted to switch to the
Safeway brand (25p a can) if it was more widely available, while Ambika
and Bruni said they would stick to, respectively, Coke and Pepsi Max.
Next, the primary school testers, Rosie, Lia, Laurie, and Mandela who
all said they enjoyed fizzy drinks and didn't care what brand they were.
All four liked Brand A (Pepsi) and thought it might be Virgin cola.
Brand B (Safeway) was also appreciated but the next Pepsi Max was
described variously as ''sickly'' and ''disgusting''. Nobody guessed
that Brand D was the Coke although it was fairly well-received but all
of the children correctly identified the Solripe which they pronounced
''weird'' and not really like cola but not bad. The Virgin cola was also
quite acceptable.
So, the primary school testers also gave Safeway Regular Select Cola
top marks but were least impressed by Pepsi Max.
Draw your own conclusions -- before you see the Cindy Crawford ads of
course.

Margaret Vaughan reports that despite Government claims that public
sector pay has moved ahead of the private sector the exact opposite
appears to be the case
NOW there are lies, damned lies and statistical quirks. The figures
given by Ministers as proof that public sector workers have moved ahead
of the private sector in the pay stakes do not stand up to scrutiny.
If you were to rely on the evidence, it would look as if average
earnings in the private sector were five pounds a week behind wages in
the public sector. For the figures, extracted from the Government's own
New Earnings Survey, give average gross weekly earnings in the UK public
sector of #329.30 compared with #324.20 in the private sector.
However, independent pay analysts Income Data Services say the figures
are misleading. They discovered the reverse to be true. Public sector
wage rates still lag behind earnings in the private sector.
The discrepancy arises because the public sector now has a much lower
proportion of manual workers. Since the advent of privatisation and
contracting-out, there are far fewer manual workers in the public
sector. The private sector figures, meanwhile, includes a huge number of
manual workers.
''This means the bald comparison is entirely misleading,'' said
analyst David Shephard, ''because you are not comparing like with like .
. . It is in fact a statistical quirk.''
Wage rises paid by private employers have continued to surge ahead of
those in the public sector which have been held down by the Treasury's
determination to rein in the pay bill for the UK's 5.5m public sector
workers.
There is no separate public and private sector breakdown for Scotland
where weekly earnings are lower than average at #335 a week for men and
#244 for women.
The independent analysts found that in 1993, when there was a 1.5% pay
rise limit in the public sector, workers in the private sector moved
ahead with increases of between 2% and 4%.
In 1994, most of the public sector settlements were around the rate of
inflation, averaging out at 2.5%. By the final quarter of last year, two
thirds of private sector pay awards were 3% or more.
For example, at the Nissan plant workers received a 4% wage rise in a
two-year deal. Five thousand workers in the flat glass industry gained
an annual increase of 3%. Three thousand non-management staff at British
Airways got a 3.6% rise.
Last year, London-based Labour Research -- which is not connected with
the Labour Party -- compiled evidence on a breakdown of pay rates in
both sectors.
It drew on unpublished figures compiled for the New Earnings Survey to
show that in all but 10 out of 25 job categories, pay rates in the
private sector were ahead of public sector wages.
Senior managers in the private sector earned on average #80 a week
more than their counterparts in the public services. Science and
engineering professionals working in private companies earned #461 a
week, compared with those in the public sector whose average was #448.
The lowest paid workers, classified as working in ''elementary''
occupations such as porters, kitchen hands, catering assistants,
cleaners and domestics, were, however, better off in the public than in
the private sector. Men in the private sector earned #27 a week less
than those in the public sector, whose wage packet was on average #252 a
week.
Women, in a not uncommon finding, earned least of all in these jobs,
but were paid substantially more in the public than in the private
sector, at #177 a week compared with #148 in private employment.
In its analysis of public service pay, published this week, Income
Data Services say that the Government's pay policies have been the main
factor slowing the rate of growth of earnings in the public sector,
relative to the private sector.
Over the 12 months to April 1994, average earnings for all employees
in the public sector rose by 2.6%, compared with 2.8% in private firms.
In the previous few surveys, the report said, it had been the public
sector which had the faster growth.
For men, the difference between public and private sector growth in
wages between 1993 and 1994 was more marked. The average weekly earnings
of men in the public sector grew by just 1.4%, against a rise of 2.8% in
the private sector. The slowest rise in pay was for manual men in the
public sector -- a rise of just 0.9% compared with 2.7% in the private
sector.
For women, the picture was again different. Slightly faster earnings
growth was shown in the public sector in the year to April 1994, of 3.7%
against 3.4% in the private sector.
The 1994 New Earnings Survey figures do not allow for direct
comparisons between wages in the two sectors. But, arguably perhaps, a
broad comparison can be drawn by looking at average wage rates for
business and financial professionals, who earned an average of #513 a
week, against teachers whose earnings were #427.
Computer analysts and programmers were on an average #439 a week,
against associate health professionals, such as nurses, on #320 a week.
While administrative and clerical officers in the Civil Service and
local government were earning an average of #223 a week, secretaries and
personal assistants and typists averaged #246 a week.
Mr Chris Trinder, of the independent Public Finance Foundation -- part
of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy -- has
warned that rapid rises in private sector pay have a knock-on effect on
future public sector pay awards.
He claims his research has proved that public service pay is largely
determined by earlier developments in the private sector. The lags are
often long and also variable, anything between nine months to three
years, but in the long run current private sector pay increases were the
single most important determinant of future central and local government
pay levels.
The significance of this, he argues, is that although the government
may announce public sector pay restraint and implement it for a period,
if pay in other parts of the economy continues to rise at a much faster
rate then, to recruit, retain and motivate people of appropriate quality
for the public services it is necessary to raise those wage rates too.
As the political row brews over the extent of job losses needed to
finance the public pay rises without breaching the freeze on the pay
bill, Mr Trinder has pointed out that every 1% rise in public sector
earnings means the loss of about 50,000 public sector jobs.
The Red Book, issued with the Chancellor's Budget, said central
government departments were expected to offset, or more than offset, pay
and price increases through efficiencies and other economies.
City analysts have said it will be difficult to fund the rise in the
pay bill from productivity increases. The CBI, which has urged that the
public sector should copy the private sector shift to decentralised
bargaining and pay flexibility, warned last year that freezing the
public sector pay bill would lead to job losses.
It argues this will not increase unemployment, provided the private
sector can expand to absorb the public sector jobs.
Last night, union leaders and local authorities, who have to fund pay
increases out of existing grants, also warned that jobs were at risk. In
Lothian, for example, the region will have to pay out an extra #3m just
to fund a deal negotiated with teachers last year to cover rises in the
cost of living.

THE freezing temperatures of space forced British astronaut Dr Michael
Foale and another shuttle crewman to cut short a spacewalk and abandon a
demonstration of high-flying weightlifting yesterday.
Earlier the shuttle Discovery plucked a one-and-a-quarter-ton science
satellite from orbit that the two men were to have used as a hi-tech
barbell.
Lincolnshire-born Dr Foale, 38, emigrated to the US in 1982 to become
an astronaut.
His mother and father watched proudly on TV in Britain today as their
son, who as a little boy jumped off sofas at home, pretending to be a
spaceman, achieved a lifelong dream.
The 250-mile-high spacewalk by Cambridge-educated Dr Foale and Bernard
Harris was the third and final major task of the joint US and Russian
shuttle mission which was launched from Florida six days ago.
A rendezvous with Russia's Mir space station and the later retrieval
of the science satellite using Discovery's robot arm were the two other
major goals of the eight-day mission which is set to end on Saturday.
The two astronauts floated through a tunnel into Discovery's cargo bay
at 12.10 GMT.
As they emerged far above the Indian Ocean, Dr Foale joked: ''Golly,
it's high isn't it?''
''Don't look down,'' answered Mr Harris.
They had been exposed to temperatures as low as minus 135 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 92C) for almost three hours when Nasa ground
controllers called an early halt to the spacewalk.
Dr Foale had earlier complained of chills.
''I can't do work with my hands like this,'' he said at one point.
The duo went outside to test space station construction techniques and
improvements to their spacesuits -- including thicker gloves and
undergarments -- which were intended to keep them warm.
One of the objectives of the exercise was to see just how cold the
crewmen would get, Nasa said.
''Looks like we put you in the deep freeze today,'' said the shuttle
pilot Eileen Collins, who choreographed the spacewalk from inside the
spacecraft.
''It was like putting my fingers in that liquid nitrogen freezer we
have at Nasa,'' Dr Foale said.
The re-usable satellite, called Spartan, was to have doubled up as an
exercise ball for the astronauts, who planned to lift and move it around
in the cargo bay in a demonstration of techniques for handling massive
objects in the absence of gravity.
Mr Harris had managed to lift and hold the satellite for an extended
period before the demonstration was interrupted.
Spartan had flown as far as 50 miles from Discovery for two days,
using a small telescope to observe the interstellar medium -- the gas
and dust between the stars and planets.
The shuttle scooped it up to bring it back to Earth so that scientists
can analyse the data recorded during its short flight.

Washington, Thursday
THE man alleged to have been the mastermind behind the World Trade
Center bombing, which killed six people and wounded over 1000 in
February 1993, has pleaded not guilty.
Iraqi Ramzi Ahmed Yousef was arrested in Pakistan on Tuesday and taken
to New York.
He was reportedly the leader of a group of terrorists from the Middle
East who plotted to assassinate the Pope in the Philippines last month.
His alleged accomplices were arrested, but he managed to escape to
Pakistan.
He first arrived in the US from Pakistan in September 1992, on the
same flight as one of the men later convicted of taking part in the
bombing, Ahmad Ajaj.
Ajaj was arrested at the airport and was found to have bomb-making
manuals.
The case against Yousef will go before Judge Duffy who presided in the
earlier trial. Another hearing is set for next Wednesday.

SCALING back of claims under the 1994 Beef Special Premium Scheme will
be at a significantly lower level than in 1993, Sir Hector Monro, the
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, said yesterday. Payments to
Scottish farmers will total #31m compared to #25m in 1993.
Latest figures indicate that claims for some 315,000 animals were made
against a regional ceiling of 244,748 for Scotland. Each producer's
claim will be reduced by 22.3%. The premium payment itself is increased
from #56.34 to #69.07.

BONN: The European Union yesterday told Germany it must uphold EU law
and end a boycott of British beef. Some German states have halted beef
imports over fears of ''mad-cow disease''. The Bonn government agreed to
allow imports of some British beef from last Monday after the EU ruled
that British cattle born after 1992 were safe. But meat processors,
distributors, and retailers in several west German states agreed
voluntary boycotts this week with the support of local governments. EU
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said the EU might turn to the
courts if Bonn did not act soon.

PEREIRA: Rescuers using their bare hands searched through rubble
yesterday for survivors of an earthquake which wrecked the Colombian
city of Pereira, killing at least 38 people and injuring more than 230.
The quake, the country's deadliest tremor in over a decade, shook a wide
area, toppling some tall buildings, opening huge cracks in others, and
sending people running into the streets in panic.
It lasted about 40 seconds, measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, and had
its epicentre about 130 miles from the capital Bogota. Shock waves were
felt in Bogota but most of the death and destruction was concentrated 90
miles away in Pereira, an industrial city of 300,000 in the heart of the
Colombian coffee belt. Officials warned the death toll was likely to
rise.

Dallas, Thursday
ALLEGATIONS that Mark Thatcher was part of a conspiracy, which is said
to have defrauded a Houston businessman of his company, were denied
today.
Mark Thatcher, businessman David Wallace, and their Dallas law firm of
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld were named as defendants in a
lawsuit by John Laughlin, the former owner of Ameristar Fuels, a Houston
jet fuel company.
The managing partner of Thatcher's law firm, Edward Copley, said
neither the firm nor its clients had any liablity. ''This is a dispute,
basically, between shareholders of a corporation,'' he said. ''We
represented two of those shareholders (Thatcher and Wallace), and the
other party has chosen now to sue the lawyers as well as the parties.''
* Cuban exiles have named a school after Lady Thatcher at a university
planned for a free Havana. Lady Thatcher was speaking at a meeting of
the Cuban American National Foundation today in Florida, which announced
the planned university would include a Margaret Thatcher School of
Democratic Government.

THERE were no record prizes yesterday on the concluding day of the
Perth Bull Sales. However, Charolais sires sold well all day recording
no less than five bids of 10,000gns or more.
Heading the way at 13,000gns was the fifth prize July 1993 Lochnagar
Imperator by Brampton Chopper from John Irvine, Inverlochy, Tomintoul,
Banffshire. Mr Irvine astutely bought this bull last October for just
3000gns. The buyer this time was Will Oates, Ouston Farms, County
Durham.
Another one to miss out on the top show prizes was the second prize
October 1993 Derrygiff Influenze -- again by Chopper -- from Ken Brady,
Derrydiff, Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, which sold at 11,000gns to
Cliff Hopwood, Clock Farm, Grimston, York. This was Mr Brady's first
visit to Perth from his 110-acre farm where he runs 30 cows.
Three bulls fetched 10,000gns with the first coming from Maerdy herd
of Welsh vet and farmer Esmor Evans of Monfa, Mold, Clwyd, who brought
no less than 35 bulls to Perth. His 10,000gns sire was the reserve
senior champion, the June 1993 Maerdy Ian by Maerdy Gentleman, which
sold to Peter Donger, Seawell, Towcester, Northants.
Minutes earlier Mr Evans had sold his senior champion Maerdy Illinois
by the home-bred United to G &amp; M Porter, Carrabus, Bridgend, Islay, at
6200gns, but he bettered that later selling again at 10,000gns for the
first prize July 1993 Maerdy Influence by Maerdy Forum. Taking this one
was the leading Suffolk sheep breeder, Jimmy Wilson, Barnyards, Mintlaw,
Aberdeenshire, acting jointly with Airdlin Farming Partnership, Ellon.
The final five-figure bid came when Scotland's top dairy farmer Dean
Anderson, Mayne, Elgin, went to 10,000gns to secure the third prize
September 1993 Heywood Imperial -- again by Chopper -- from Steve Ling,
Heywood, Wellington, Somerset. In turn, Mr Ling paid 7000gns for the
intermediate and reserve overall champion, the September 1993 Thornham
Interceptor by Balmyle Champion from Geoff Eggleston, Thornham Hill,
Newcastle-on-Tyne.
The money kept circulating when John Irvine invested some of his
profit, paying 9000gns for the reserve junior champion, the October 1993
Thrunton Impeccable by the 30,000gns Moncur General from Colin Campbell
&amp; Sons, Thrunton, Morpeth.
Also selling at 9000gns was the breeder of Chopper Billy Turner,
Linghams, Ripon. He sold the unplaced April 1993 Brampton Invoice by
Chopper to near-neighbour Michael Atkinson, Mowbray Park, Ripon. Two
leading Perthshire breeders, Bill Bruce, Drumkilbow, Meigle, and David
Walter, Balthayock, Perth, teamed up for what they described as ''a real
bargain'' to get the second prize Maerdy Iliad at 8000gns.
The commercial trade was topped by two sales at 7500gns. The first
came when Jim Goldie, Townfoot, Dumfries, sold de Crispigny Illustrious
to Robert Weir, Townfoot, Thornhill. Scott Rodger, Muirhouse, Stow, paid
a similar price to buy the first prize Maerdy Idea. Maerdy also sold at
7000gns when Scottish Livestock Services, through its director Jack
Lawson, took Islam for the AI station at Scone.
Two leading south-west of Scotland farming companies maintained their
practice of sharing a top bull when Blackwood Farms, Auldgirth, and
Glenapp Estates, Ballantrae, paid Jim Goldie 7000gns for Goldies
Intimate. From the same district, Gelston Castle Farms, Castle Douglas,
sold their first prize winner, Kelton Impresario to the recently founded
pedigree herd of Mrs Glenda Tillbrook, Woodrow Farm, Amersham, Bucks.
The overall and junior champion, Bassingbourn Impact from Mr and Mrs M
Parker, Grange, Duxford, Cambridge, made the relatively modest price of
5000gns to W Johnson, North Milbrex, Fyvie, Aberdeenshire, while the
reserve intermediate champion, Fairway Impression from David Fattorini,
Skewkirk Hall, York, sold at 6500gns to W Gubbins &amp; Sons, Penhole,
Launceston, Cornwall.
At the conclusion of the sale Esmor Evans was the happiest man in
Perth having sold 26 bulls through the ring to gross #132,405 for the
great average of #5092.
The Charolais breed secretary summed up the sale: ''It's been a very
solid trade without any real top prices.'' Overall 263 bulls average
#3591 -- down #206 on 1994 when 230 were sold. During four days of
trading in Perth 711 head were sold to gross #2,063,588 for an average
of #2878. Auctioneers: United Auctions Limited.

Gaza Strip, Thursday
PEACE talks between Israel and the PLO slid deeper into crisis today
after Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat failed to break a deadlock over
security and an Israeli ban on Palestinians.
Prime Minister Rabin and the PLO leader agreed to meet again in one
week's time to give officials time to try to resolve differences over
extending Palestinian self-rule to the occupied West Bank.
Rabin played down talk of a crisis in implementing the long-stalled
self-rule deal. But Yasser Abed Rabbo, Arafat's information chief, said:
''I think there is a crisis, a real crisis. There are two tendencies and
two approaches.''
The two-hour meeting at the Israeli-Gaza Strip border ended without an
expected joint news conference. Instead, a stern-faced Arafat walked
head down to his car to go to a meeting with a visting EU delegation led
by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.
Since the start of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho last May, the two
sides have gone from meeting to meeting in Cairo, Gaza, and elsewhere
with little progress on such key issues as Palestinian elections and
Israeli troop redeployment.
An unprecedented four-way Arab-Israeli summit in Cairo last week was
aimed at jump-starting the talks. That meeting also broke up without an
expected news conference.
Today, Juppe and delegates from Germany and Spain said the Middle East
peace process was at a critical stage.
''A break in the peace process would have catastrophic consequences
for the whole region and for international stability,'' Juppe said.
Both Rabin and Arafat have staked their political futures on
implementing their 17-month-old peace agreement, but they have run up
against obstacles at every step.
Today, Rabin said: ''There were differences but by no means will I
describe this as a crisis. We decided in the light of the fact it wasn't
possible from the standpoint of time and other circumstances to reach
solutions today to hold another discussion next week,'' he said.
But he insisted an 18-day-old ban on Palestinians entering Israel from
the Gaza Strip and West Bank would remain in force. The closure was
imposed after two Gaza suicide bombers killed 21 Israelis in Israel last
month.
Rabin added that Arafat must take control of law enforcement. ''From
our standpoint, the main dominant consideration is the matter of
security,'' he said.
Arafat has voiced anger at the slow pace of expanding self-rule beyond
Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho.
''The meeting did not reach any results and the reason is that there
are differences over the main subjects of discussions,'' Abed Rabbo
said.
For the Palestinians, the key issues are troop redeployment, Jewish
settlements, and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Arafat's
supporters said the closure, which has stopped 60,000 Palestinian
labourers going to work in Israel, only erodes support for peace moves
and gives momentum to Islamic opponents. Half of Gaza is unemployed even
when Israel lets Palestinians in.
Meanwhile in the United States today, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres said the PLO must gain the upper hand against Muslim militants
before Palestinian self-rule can be expanded.
Speaking in Atlanta, Peres said Arafat was capable of meeting Israeli
demands that he controlled Gaza-based members of Hamas and Islamic
Jihad, which both oppose the peace process between Israel and the PLO.
''It is either he will control them or they will control him. I hope
he will be able to establish his authority,'' he said.
In Jordan, King Hussein today toured the last of the land returned to
his country by Israel under their peace treaty, expressing optimism
about Jordan's future under peace.
''I am very hopeful of the period ahead, a period of consolidation,''
he said, emphasising the Israeli-Jordanian peace was negotiated without
outside involvement.
''The possibilities are limitless. We faced up to our responsibilities
and we hope that the others will do the same. I hope they will achieve
what we have achieved and we will all have peace in the region.''
Earlier, officials from the two sides initialled accords on border
crossings, tourism, and security on the Israeli side of the Jordan
River. The accords were the first in a series covering everything from
trade to border demarcation to be signed by June.--Reuter

Sarajevo, Thursday
BOSNIAN Serbs launched a mortar barrage at government army positions
in Sarajevo today, blasting apart a truce that has held since New Year's
Day.
Machinegun fire was heard after explosions hit an area near the
Bosnian capital's Jewish cemetery. The frontline separating the mainly
Muslim government army and the Bosnian Serbs runs through the cemetery.
''There were eight explosions in the vicinity of the Jewish cemetery
from the Bosnian Serb army side. Now everything is quiet,'' said a UN
spokeswoman.
In Zagreb, a UN spokesman said the Serbs opened fire because the
government troops had dug trenches in violation of the truce.
The Bosnian Serbs have been besieging Sarajevo for more than 1000
days, during which time hundreds of civilians have been killed by sniper
fire and shelling.
Meanwhile, a UN convoy with food and medicine reached the besieged
city of Bihac today.--Reuter/AP

Los Angeles, Thursday
THE first policeman to arrive at the spot where O J Simpson's ex-wife
and her friend were murdered today gave graphic evidence of their
blood-soaked bodies and of bloody footprints leaving the scene.
Robert Riske told Simpson's double murder trial in Los Angeles that he
saw ''a female, white, in a black, black dress, lying in a puddle of
blood on the walkway.'' He identified the body as that of Nicole Brown
Simpson. A pool of blood under her flowed down towards the sidewalk.
Riske said one of 25-year-old Ronald Goldman's eyes was still open. He
prodded the eyeball to see if he could get any reaction but he was dead.
Photographs of the bodies were displayed on a large screen for the
jury who saw Nicole Simpson curled at the bottom of steps, her head a
mass of blood partially covered by blood-matted blonde hair, and her
bare legs smeared in blood.
Goldman was resting against a fence, his blood-covered shirt pulled
partially over his head, and his jeans soaked in more blood.
Simpson, an American footballer turned film actor, has denied stabbing
his ex-wife and Goldman to death.
Riske said he saw a trail of bloody footprints leading from the
pavement outside Nicole Simpson's home towards the front door and then
along an alleyway along the side of the house.--Reuter

<TEXT>
A SOLICITOR who reported two partners in her firm to the Law Society
for alleged overcharging received a #100,000 pay-off when she left the
practice, Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told yesterday.
Mrs Gaenor Stuart-Murray was given the money and a ''glowing''
reference when she left Robin Thompson and Partners, of Castle Street,
Edinburgh.
She admitted that she was advised to ask for #250,000, and told not to
sign a document which allowed the other members of the firm to continue
in partnership until she got what she wanted.
Two partners in her former firm are on trial charged with fraud.
Mr David Stevenson, 43, and Mr Lawrence Lumsden, 38, both deny
overcharging solicitors when sending out accounts of expenses after
winning cases.
The charge against them alleges that they overcharged for things such
as advocates' fees and expert witnesses' expenses a total of 13 times
between December 1985 and May 1992, and gained a total of #2673.09 for
their firm.
Cross-examined yesterday by Mr Gordon Jackson, QC, for Mr Lumsden, Mrs
Stuart-Murray denied going to the Law Society with her complaints of
overcharging as an ''act of sheer vindictiveness''.
She accepted that her relationship with her colleagues deteriorated
when she continued to make her allegations of overcharging.
When Mr Jackson suggested it was too much of a coincidence that she
went to the Law Society on the very day she was fired, she claimed that
she was always going to report the matter.
Mrs Stuart-Murray, from Kelso, came to work in Edinburgh from one of
Robin Thomson and Partners associated firms in England, in which she was
a partner.
She told the trial earlier that she checked a bill which had been sent
out and found that an amount stated for advocate's fees was more than
Robin Thompson and Partners had paid the advocate in the first place.
She told Mr Jackson that she was not satisfied with a review carried
out by one of the English partners after she took her allegations to
London.
Mr Jackson pointed out that Scottish senior counsel's opinion was that
the firm's methods of charging may not have been strictly proper, but
were widespread and not thought of as professional misconduct, far less
illegal.
In any event, said Mr Jackson, some of the billing practices were
stopped after Mrs Stuart-Murray raised the matter.
After leaving the firm, in early 1992, Mrs Stuart-Murray sued the
English partners.
She accepted that if she had not signed a form allowing the
partnership to continue after her departure it would have dissolved,
costing the firm a fortune in tax.
The threat not to sign was the background to her pay-off, and to the
good reference which Mr Jackson claimed was effectively dictated to
Robin Thompson and Partners by her solicitors.
The trial continues.

Grozny, Thursday
CHECHEN fighters scaled down their forces in the capital Grozny today,
virtually surrendering control to Russian troops after a six-week battle
in which hundreds of people died.
But Chechen commander Aslan Maskhadov vowed to fight on against the
Russians who moved into mainly-Muslim Chechnya last December to crush
its bid for independence.
''What's so special about one city?'' he said. ''The main thing is
that people are getting used to this war. They are becoming disciplined.
Soon it will be warm and we can fight in the mountains for 12 years.''
In Moscow, the chief of the Russian general staff, Mikhail Kolesnikov,
said he thought organised Chechen resistance was now virtually over and
that breakaway leader Dzhokhar Dudayev would be ''destroyed''.
The Chechens and outgunned and outnumbered, and on Wednesday said they
were moving their headquarters out of the shattered city to continue the
fight elsewhere.
Since they launched a New Year's Eve offensive, Russian troops have
rained shells down on the city and bombed it from the air. The hundreds
thought to have been killed have included many ethnic Russian civilians
who found themselves trapped in the city. Some reports say the death
toll may run into thousands.
Moscow's forces need only to advance about a mile from the north in
order to cut off the lone road into the city, and their inevitable
encirclement of Grozny will be complete.
Although the Chechens have dramatically thinned out they say some
fighters will stay behind to harass Russian troops.
Chechen fighters were defiant even as they pulled out.
Adam Baizatov, 51, said: ''Moscow fell three times and it did not mean
the end of Russia. Unlike Russians, we have spirit and love for our
country, and that is all you need.''
Russian military officials expect Gudermes, 25 miles to the east, to
become the new stronghold of resistance.
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, who is under fire for the high
death toll and the level of force used in Chechnya, said an analysis of
the army operation would be made later this month.
Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin sacked Colonel-General Georgy
Kondratyev, one of several top generals who have condemned the use of
the army on Russian soil.
Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev today described Russia's
millitary intervention in Chechnya as a huge mistake which would cost
the country dear.
In an interview with BBC television, Gorbachev said he had warned
President Yeltsin about the consequences of sending in troops and had
offered to act as a mediator.
''They've unleased terrible bloodshed, they've set the army against
its own people, because these are our own people. They've sent untrained
boys to fight, who don't know what war is,'' Gorbachev said.
''It's a huge mistake. And it's going to cost us dear. Not just in
economic terms but especially politically and morally. Those in power
have put themselves in a corner.''
Gorbachev, who during his seven years in power led the Soviet Union
from communism to democracy, said the intervention was a great defeat
for the Russian government.
''They've lost in Russia, they've lost in the Caucasus, they've lost
in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), they've lost in
relations with the West.''
Gorbachev refused to be drawn on whether he would be a candidate for
the Russian presidency in elections due in June 1996 but said the
present government was sliding towards authoritarianism.--Reuter

GROWERS holding on to last season's wheat in the hope of cashing in on
top prices are distorting the market, according to Mr Don Patterson,
general manager of Dalgety Grain.
He has warned that prices could drop from April onwards as large
tonnages come on to the market over a short period.
Mr Patterson estimates that about four million tonnes of mainly
quality wheat is till left on farms. Area aid payments are also
contributing to the distortion, he claims. ''Growers who are flush with
cash are less reliant on releasing grain on a regular basis to maintain
cash flow.''

WORK began yesterday on felling giant oaks in a Perthshire forest, to
provide timber to restore the roof of the Stirling Castle's Great Hall.
The hall's original sixteenth century hammer beam structure was
removed around 1800 when the castle was converted into barracks for the
Napoleonic Wars.
Recreating the old roof, which could take up to eight years, will
begin in the spring as part of a #20m restoration scheme at the castle
being carried out by Historic Scotland.
Around 350 oak trees from Bailefuil Wood, north of Callander, will be
needed to provide enough 30ft logs for the roof beams. The felling is
being done in consultation with Scottish Natural Heritage and the
Forestry Commission's commercial arm, Forest Enterprise.

GRAND National hero Bob Champion led the tributes to his former
colleague John Burke, who died on Wednesday, aged 41.
Mr Burke, who completed the rare Cheltenham Gold Cup-Grand National
double on Royal Frolic and Rag Trade in 1976, rode Mr Champion's famous
Grand National winner Aldaniti in the jumping scenes for the film
Champions.
''John was a great jockey who won all the top races including Gold
Cups and Grand Nationals,'' Mr Champion said yesterday. ''He was a
smashing character who was full of life and a great horseman. John will
be sadly missed.''
Mr Burke, who quit riding at the end of the 1984-85 season, died at
his home in Upton-upon-Severn of a heart attack.
He left a wife, Lynn and two children, Kelly, 19, and Josh, 17.
In recent years Mr Burke had been head lad to Kinnersley trainer Mr
Simon Christian who said he was ''shocked and saddened'' by his death.
''He had been with the yard for four years until last summer when he
had to give up riding due to arthritis,'' said Mr Christian.
''Apart from a bit of arthritis in his shoulder, John was a fit man
who was very active and played a full part in the running of the yard.''
Mr Christian said that his former head lad, who had recovered from a
recent operation to his shoulder, had driven past the gallops earlier in
the week and given a cheery wave to the lads.
He said: ''It was a great privilege to have worked with him and I know
that the whole village are deeply shocked at his death. Our hearts go
out to his wife Lynn and his children Kelly and Josh.''

She was fined #200 after admitting proposing an amnesty for non-payers

The court heard that Mrs McVicar, who won the Easterhouse Garthamlock

ROBBIE DINWOODIE, Scottish Political Correspondent, dips a toe into
the debate on regional government south of the Border, and finds it
decidedly tepid.
NO-ONE talks about devolution and assemblies any more in Scotland.
Here, suspicious of the dictum that power devolved is power retained, we
have moved away from the term devolution and a Scottish Parliament is
discussed in other phrases, the tried and trusted Home Rule, the newer
buzz-words popular sovereignty and the SNP's slogan Independence in
Europe.
However, England is beginning to wake up to the idea of regional
government as a means of decentralising and democratising the monolith
of quangoised control from Westminster, and it is like listening in on a
conversation at a bus stop between two people who have just come out of
a coma after 20 years.
The debate south of the Border is less developed, poorly focused. A
long learning curve lies ahead. Mr Tony Blair's plan for English
regional assemblies, as a way of squaring the circle of Mr Tam Dalyell's
West Lothian question, has brought a near-hysterical reaction from
senior Conservatives.
The Prime Minister has made his attack on the idea of regional
assemblies for England a central plank of his defence of the Union and
rejection of constitutional change. His claim that there is no demand
whatever in England for decentralised, democratic government is not
borne out by our poll, although it clearly touches a chord in his own
party.
We started by asking the English a question about their perception of
their own national identity. This showed that 51% considered themselves
British, compared to 41% who saw themselves as English. It may be that
the English tend to use these terms virtually interchangeably but it was
a marked contrast with North of the Border, where 78% considered
themselves Scots and only 19% chose to label themselves British.
Respondents then had put to them the recent political debate about
devolved government for Britain, with proposals for bodies in Scotland,
Wales, and the English regions. They were asked, if there were a
referendum tomorrow on this issue how would they vote -- in favour of or
against the setting up of these separate assemblies?
Serious opposition to this from Conservative voters -- 60% against,
24% in favour, with 16% recorded as don't knows -- was influential in
producing a narrow rejection overall by 39% to 35%.
Mr Blair will be heartened that his party's supporters were most
enthusiastic about the idea, favouring it by 43% to 33%. Liberal
Democrats, however, who consider themselves to be the natural party of
decentralisation and federalism, may be disappointed to find that their
voters' support for regional assemblies was lukewarm, with a narrow
majority of 38% to 37%.
The regional breakdown is surprising, however, with no obvious
North-South divide in England, as might have been expected. The North
West of England, for example, gave less support to the concept of
regional autonomy than did the South East, while the South West -- as a
Liberal heartland with a Cornish nationalist element -- came out
strongly against the idea.
The most favourable response came in the West Midlands (36% to 31%),
with East Midlands in favour 37% to 35% and the North (effectively the
North East) supporting regional assemblies by 42% to 40%. This region
had one of the lowest levels of don't knows, which may reflect the fact
that there has been considerable local debate on the issue over time.
During the Scottish devolution debate of the 1970s, North East MPs
were active in arguing that this should go ahead only if they got an
assembly too. This has turned full circle in recent months with the
launch of a Campaign for a Northern Assembly, a body modelled on the
Campaign for a Scottish Assembly which has the advice and support of the
latter.
East Anglia appeared most hostile to the plan -- against by 58% to 34%
-- but given the sparse population of the area even an exercise as
extensive as our System Three poll may provide too small a sample to be
reliable. The South West was against by 47% to 31%; the North West by
40% to 32%; Yorkshire and Humberside by 34% to 32%; and the South East
by 39% to 38%.
The real winner in the English poll could most charitably be described
as a lack of knowledge on which to base an opinion. Put another way,
apathy seems to be the victor. Only 7% of respondents considered
devolution a very important factor in their voting intentions (barely
higher on 9% for Labour supporters) and only 19% considered the issue
quite important.
Those who considered it neither important nor unimportant totalled
19%, while 26% said this issue was not very important and 23% considered
it not at all important. One result of this apathy is that the issue is
not a risky one for the major parties in electoral terms.
Asking whether stances on devolution would influence voters in their
choice of party produced a minimal response. For example, 7% of people
said Labour's devolution could lead them to switch to Labour, while 12%
said it could put them off. However, since the vast bulk of that 12%
group were already confirmed anti-Labour voters the actual impact would
be minimal.
Mr Chris Eynon of System Three says: ''Overall, the effect of this
policy on levels of support for Labour in England was likely to be
negligible,'' with perhaps a marginal potential gain for the
Conservatives. ''Given the lack of importance attached to these more
generally, however, it is other issues which will have a much stronger
bearing in determining votes gained or lost.''
For the sake of comparison with our poll this week on Scottish
attitudes to self-government, we asked an identical question North and
South of the Border. It stated: ''John Major has said that the setting
up of separate assemblies for Scotland and Wales will lead ultimately to
a break-up of the UK. What are your views on England, Scotland, and
Wales becoming independent countries, each governed separately?''
Only 8% were very much in favour of this in England (compared to 26%
in Scotland), while 17% were slightly in favour (21% in Scotland). A
larger proportion were undecided in England (32%) than in Scotland
(17%), while those against totalled 35% in England and 25% in Scotland.
The highest figure in support of the break-up of the UK came in the
North (North East), where 34% were in favour, again reflecting the fact
that people there are further down the road of forming an opinion on
constitutional change.
Snapshot of election intentions
BY going in to England for the first time with poll for The
Herald/System Three, the exercise has provided the spin-off of a
snapshot of voting intentions South of the Border.
In order to give the necessary information for analysing people's
attitudes to the issues, respondents were asked the standard question
normally asked in our monthly polls North of the Border, ''If there was
a General Election tomorrow which of these would you vote for?''
Analysing these by their usual methods, and excluding the 15% who were
undecided or refused to indicate their preference, System Three
calculate the current party standings in England (excluding Wales and
Scotland) as: Conservatives 26%, Labour 56%, Liberal Democrats 14%,
Greens 3%.

KEY FINDINGS
Key findings of The Herald/System Three poll on English attitudes to
devolution:
* Most English people see themselves as British first (51%) and
English second (41%) -- the opposite of north of the Border, where
Scottish is the main self identity (78%) and British a poor second
(19%).
* A referendum tomorrow on the idea of having separate devolved
Assemblies for Wales, Scotland and the regions of England would be
defeated by 39% to 35% by the English electorate, with 25% undecided (in
Scotland the don't knows total only 3%).
* Conservative voters are more set in their hostile views, rejecting
the idea by 60% to 24%, Labour most enthusiastic at 43% to 33% in
favour, and Liberal Democrats narrowly supporting the plan 38% to 37%.
* On a regional breakdown East Anglia and, perhaps surprisingly, the
South West are most hostile, followed by the North West, with Yorkshire
and Humberside and the South East narrowly against.
* Most in favour are the West Midlands, followed by the North (that is
the North East) and the East Midlands.
* Apathy is the real winner. Only 26% regarded the issue as important,
19% are neutral and 50% feel it is not important.
* The issue is neither a significant vote winner or loser. It might
win as few as 2% to the Labour cause while putting off 3% of party
supporters, or attract 2% to the Conservatives' hostile stance, which
might cost that party less than half of one per cent.
* Given John Major's prediction that devolution would lead to the
break-up of the UK, 25% of English voters say they are in favour of this
happening, with 44% against and 32% undecided (Scots figures were 47% in
favour, 35% against and 17% undecided).
* There are indications that the debate is more informed in the the
North than elsewhere, with sharper divisions and fewer undecided,
perhaps reflecting the fact that this region has always taken an
interest in the subject is now the scene of a vigorous Campaign for a
Northern Assembly.
* The System Three poll of 1559 adults throughout England was carried
out in their homes between January 25 and 31 in 145 constituencies,
using a random sampling method for selection of respondents which was
then weighted during analysis to match the population in terms of age,
sex and class.

The Karen people of Burma have been fighting for autonomy for 40
years. Now the army that was trained by Britain to fight the Japanese is
on the point of defeat by a brutal regime -- and Britain will not help
FIFTY years after the Imperial Japanese army was thrown out of Burma,
a British-raised rebel army today faces capture, torture, and decimation
in circumstances eerily reminiscent of the brutal Japanese occupation.
In a camp situated in a horseshoe of the Moei River, on the Thai-Burma
border, the scene of fierce fighting during the Second World War, the
remnants of the Karen National Liberation army, whose leaders operated
behind Japanese lines with Force 136, are putting up a last stand
against thousands of troops of SLORC, Burma's ''Big Brother'', the
Burmese State Law and Order Restoration Council.
Unless international pressure is brought against the Burmese
Government to stop the excesses of the Burmese People's Army this year
will see an end to the 40-year-old struggle by the Karen for autonomy.
The Karen, some of whose officers still remember with some emotion
ambushing Japanese troops in British-led expeditions, are hopelessly
outnumbered. Two weeks ago their main base, Manerplaw, fell to a heavy
Burmese bombardment, sending a flood of 10,000 refugees fleeing across
the Thai-Burmese border. Others have fled to jungle hideouts in Burma to
regroup.
When the SLORC brutally regained power in Rangoon in 1988 after
democracy riots and after declaring void the election in which Burmese
people's heroine Aung San Suu Kyi was outright winner, it was to the
Karen-controlled areas of Eastern Burma that the Burmese students fled
to form their own army to fight the Rangoon military junta.
Many of those students, more mature, well-trained, and accustomed to
the malarial jungle, are fighting alongside the Karen in the ABSDF --
All Burma Students Democratic Front.
For the past two days in Kawmoora the air has resounded to the Burmese
Government barrage. Howitzer and heavy mortar fire, some using air-burst
phosphorus shells, are pounding this base -- the headquarters of the
KNLA's crack 101st Battalion.
Access to the front line is barred by Thai troops, but Karen officers
say that the Burmese are using civilians to test their mine field
defences, but with the Burmese claiming that 4000 have deserted the
Karen, this is also a propaganda war.
In a separate attack Burmese troops crossed to the Thai side to
attempt to assault the base from the rear, but they withdrew when Thai
troops opened fire.
International politics will be the deciding factor in whether the
Karen will be annihilated or allowed to regroup to continue to fight a
guerrilla war behind SLORC lines.
The full catalogue of atrocities against the Karen, detailed by
Amnesty International, no longer carry the same weight with foreign
governments who are anxious to do trade with Burma.
Refugees streaming across the border talk of summary executions, of
their relatives being tortured to death, including slow mutilation and
burning. But British, American, Singapore, Thai and Chinese companies
are already well established in Rangoon and doing business.
Fifty years ago 16,000 allied prisoners of war, including Sherwood
Foresters, Argyll and Sutherland and Gordon Highlanders, and soldiers of
the Leicesters, East Surrey, Beds and Herts and Manchester Regiments
died, as forced labourers building the Burma-Siam (Death) Railway.
History is repeating itself in the lands of the Karen, just 60 miles
away from Hell Fire Pass, one of the major scenes of Japanese brutality
along the infamous railway.
Here another railway is being built. This time by the Burmese. So far
between 200 to 300 people are estimated to have died.
According to refugees fleeing to Thailand, forced labourers are
subject to horrific beatings, debilitating illnesses and are neither
paid nor given food. The Burmese Government uses forced labour for most
of its infrastructural projects.
The railway is needed to enable the construction of a pipeline to run
to Thailand from an Andaman Sea gas field. The field is being developed
by Unocal of the United States and Total of France. Two days after the
fall of Manerplaw the Thai Government signed a trade agreement for gas
through this pipeline worth #250m a year to the Burmese Government.
While Britain's connections to the Karen are now tenuous, returning to
this region of conflict does evoke nostalgic memories.
Four years ago on visit to the Karen's jungle headquarters Major Aaron
Po Yin, a Karen staff officer and friend, asked me if I could go to
London to collect the Distinguished Service Medal he had won for bravery
in ambushes behind Japanese lines.
Major Aaron, formerly with the Burmese Navy, was dropped behind enemy
lines to fight alongside British Major Seagrim -- known to the Karen as
Grandfather Long Legs -- who was executed as a spy by the Japanese in
1943.
I travelled to London and returned with the medal some six months
later when it was pinned to his tunic to his obvious delight. He died
soon afterwards.
Having served with the British fighting the Burmese and Japanese, he
could not come to terms with the treaty Britain signed with Burma,
giving the country independence and the Karen nothing.
''Why did the British forget the Karen when we gave you such
loyalty?'' he once asked. In the expediency of South-east Asian politics
the more politically astute of the Karen leaders know that Burma's
yet-to-be exploited riches come higher on the regional agenda than the
future of an ethnic minority.

NEXT week The Herald introduces expanded editorial coverage which will
further confirm the paper as Scotland's premier daily quality newspaper.
The expansion of The Herald comes as new circulation figures show the
paper selling 30,000 copies a day more than the Scotsman. Officially
audited readership figures for the period January to December, l994,
also reveal the margin of The Herald's lead over the Scotsman. The
Herald with a readership figure of 378,000 has 126,000 more readers than
the Scotsman at 252,000.

THE Clydesdale Bank faces its first strike, after staff voted in
favour of a series of one-day walkouts in a bitter pay dispute.
Leaders of the Banking, Insurance,and Finance Union yesterday warned
that the first strike would go ahead on Friday next week, if the dispute
was not resolved meantime.
The union also claimed that many of the bank's 325 branches would be
forced to close on the days of industrial action.
Despite talks breaking down on Monday, without any agreement being
reached on a slightly improved offer, the bank announced the following
day that it was proceeding with that pay package.
It said increases of between 3% and 7% would be awarded to
''satisfactory performers'', but no rises would be given to the fewer
than 10% of employees whose performance was considered less than
satisfactory.
The union is seeking a 6.75% average pay rise for its 4000 members
among the bank's 6000 staff, and has accused the management of treating
employees with contempt by pushing ahead with the pay package without
agreement.
The Clydesdale was taken over eight years ago by the National
Australia Group, and Bifu blames the parent company for an alleged
crisis in industrial relations. The union pointed to the Clydesdale's
record profits of #110m last year, and said staff deserved a better
deal.
The result of the strike ballot, announced at Bifu's Glasgow office
yesterday, showed that those members who did vote backed action by more
than two-to-one: 1721 for, 746 against.
''This vote reflects the deep unrest among Clydesdale staff at the
performance culture being forced upon them,'' said Mr Keith Brookes,
Bifu's assistant secretary.
Union leaders emphasised that they hoped the dispute could be resolved
without a strike taking place. They said that they were asking Acas to
intervene and remained open to talks.
Mr Brookes added: ''We hope the bank behaves sensibly, but the bank's
actions this week have not been sensible, so I do not hold out a great
deal of optimism there. It would appear to me that there will be a
strike a week Friday.''
A spokesman for the Clydesdale Bank expressed disappointment at the
vote for strike action, but added that the bank felt the result would
have been very different if the staff had been voting on the improved
offer.
He said: ''We certainly hope to avert strike action and we will
consider going to Acas to avoid such action.''
But he rejected the union's claim that many branches would have to
close on the days of strikes.

Assorted musicbiz types descended on Glasgow for the A&amp;R Festival,
hoping to find the next pop sensation. David Belcher joined the throng.
IN the week that the London record industry came sniffing round
Glasgow en masse, some of our bands fawned like puppies while others
snarled and pooped on the hands that were ostensibly offering to feed
them.
Lung Leg were the ones baring their teeth and assuming the moral high
ground during the Glasgow A&amp;R Festival, which reaches its conclusion in
three different city-centre venues tonight.
Scheduled to appear at the 13th Note on Wednesday, Lung Leg
deliberately dropped out. Why?
Because Lung Leg are commendably spikey agit-punk purists.
''The idea of playing for record companies and putting on an act,''
said drummer Jade Green, her lips pursing ever-so-slightly into a
disdainful moue. ''If people are genuinely interested in us, they'll
find out who we are when we play our regular gigs.''
Note to metropolitan musicbiz talent-spotters: Lung Leg's next gig is
next month, a fundraiser for Body Positive at Nice'n'Sleazy with Mambo
Taxi, Bis, and Pink Kross. Additionally, they've a John Peel Radio 1
session being broadcast a week on Saturday, and their current
seven-track EP, The Negative Delinquent Autopsy, is available on the
Piao label.
But if Lung Leg weren't playing during the A&amp;R week, how did I get to
talk to them? Because they were in the front row for shows by Yummy Fur
and the Blisters, frugging coolly in their stylish cocktail frocks and
engaging in matily irreverent badinage across the footlights with both
groups.
For instance, when the Blisters' vocalist announced their penultimate
song as Nostalgia, a sharp-witted Lung Leg-ite vouchsafed an instant
correction: ''I thought it was Neuralgia.'' The Blister chuckled. ''Very
good,'' he said. But how good were the Blisters and Yummy Fur?
It's safe to say that, like Lung Leg, Yummy Fur are probably not
enamoured of being hotly clutched to the bosom of the metropolitan
recordbiz for the purposes of being groomed as the new Eternal or East
17. Instead, they seem inspired by the sonic anarchy of Spike Jones and
Captain Beefheart, with none of their songs lasting more than 90
seconds, to boot. Indeed, during a flying visit to Nice'n'Sleazy's
lavatory, I missed two whole Yummy Fur opuses.
Having kicked off with a laconic re-cap of their most recent review in
the music media -- ''Apparently we're 'quirky punk-pop with a
barbed-wire edge' '' -- Yummy Fur went on to reveal themselves as
creators of an abrasively-funny 100mph pop-punk. I was especially
tickled by Yummy Fur's lyrics. ''Cyclops,'' was one song's single-word
chorus, while another repeatedly employed a simple five-word mantra --
''There is no Santa Claus'' -- to tell us that . . . well, there is no
Santa Claus.
Hopefully, Christmas will arrive early in the form of a big-league
recording contact for the Blisters, who, contrary to the rawness of
their punk-redolent name, are a literate and sinisterly foppish bunch of
classic songsmiths sporting exquisitely-knotted ties and Edwardian
three-piece pinstripe suits, complete with watch-chains.
Assisted by occasional deft bursts of atmospheric trumpet, the
Blisters are a gutsier, rockier, yet more languid riposte to the
Housemartins. There is a fatalistic music-hall jauntiness to much of
what they do, and if they don't get signed up pronto, the British music
industry is more dead-in-the-head than we all think it is. Sadly, I
didn't spot many A&amp;R types at the Blisters' show.
So what were London's A&amp;R legions most obviously interested in? To
date, the bulk of the industry's attention seems to have focused on the
Paul Weller-esque Ball of Confusion. Travis are rumoured to be on the
brink of putting pen to paper; Captain Shifty attracted King Tut's
biggest paying audience of the week, while the Supernaturals, Melonhaus
and Goldust all pulled large numbers of scouts.
''I can't speak for other venues, but for me, the industry actually
turning up has been the highlight of the week,'' said Paul Cardow, of
the Cathouse, well-used to A&amp;R geezers phoning ahead to request
guest-list placings which, on the night, they then fail to utilise.
''Punter-wise, I think it's been far from brilliant, which is a shame,''
he added. At one Glasgow show, in fact, half the 70-strong audience were
A&amp;R men, publishers, or media.
Other venues report healthy attendances by paying customers, however,
with brisk over-the-bar sales for Nice'n'Sleazy's Plug 2 CD, the venue's
second such sampler for 11 up-and-coming local bands. Unfortunately,
there was less interest in the week's most hotly-tipped act -- no names,
to save their blushes -- whose less-than-perfect opening song managed to
repel the large numbers of scouts they'd attracted.
And what of the three A&amp;R types who tumbled into King Tut's hot on the
heels of Creation supremo Alan McGee, a week-long fixture in his home
town? Who you in to see tonight, lads, they were asked. ''We don't
know,'' came the giggly reply. ''We're just going wherever McGee goes.''
Ah, the music biz. To know the beast a little is to realise that you
need to know it a whole lot more. Thumbs aloft and caps raised to the
Glasgow A&amp;R Festival and its tireless organiser, Geoff Ellis, for
allowing us to have increased our knowledge this week through first-hand
exposure and observation.
* NATURALLY, all my Boss Grooves revelations are exclusive, but
sometimes some of them are more exclusive than others. Like this one:
you might be advised to start queuing now outside all the usual
booking-agencies for tickets for a special gig by Faith No More on March
10 at Glasgow's Garage. Tickets go on sale Monday.

RUGBY player Brian Conlan, Alloa's Midlands District Union wing, is in
the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, after an operation to remove a
blood clot from his brain. He collapsed on Saturday evening after he had
played for the fourth-division club in a friendly match against their
Tillicoultry neighbours, Hillfoots, though it is not known if his injury
was rugby-related. Conlan had also played on the wing for the Midlands
in the District Union championship match against Edinburgh at Kirkcaldy
a week past Wednesday.

Mary Brennan discerns a degree of humbug in the reactions to a group
of disabled people who dare to challenge established stereotypes
EVEN before it got on stage, Graeae's Ubu had managed to get up
people's noses. Newham Council banned the poster as likely to cause
offence -- passers-by could have been outraged by the cumulative
incorrectness of a semi-naked man wearing fur, smoking a fag, with a
rude word inscribed on his behind.
The production itself played to packed houses at the local arts
centre. The Guardian vetoed the same publicity shot, murmuring
protectively of readers' sensibilities.
Heigh-ho! At the Traverse last weekend, crowds of folk -- from
schoolgirls to elder citizens -- passed dozens of the self same image
without batting an eyelid. I asked one girl what she thought. She
glanced, grinned and said: ''Cheeky!''
Ewan Marshall, the company's artistic director, says they were
somewhat bemused by the objections. ''How do you present one of the
nastiest characters in theatre history without unpleasant imagery?
You're talking here about the worst excesses of dictatorship -- it's a
play that predicts the twentieth century appallingly well -- and Ubu is
a crude, vicious thug!''
When they mulled it over, they realised ''there is nothing nice about
Ubu . . .'' And then they wondered -- not for the first time -- if this
shudder of official distaste wasn't more about who they were . . .
Graeae is Britain's -- probably Europe's -- leading theatre company of
disabled people. Since the start of the eighties it has toured
productions that have focused specifically on aspects of disabled
experience, sometimes from a historical perspective and sometimes as a
reflection of current circumstances.
This new translation of Ubu is the first classic text to be staged by
the company. It's bawdy, anarchic and very, very physical. And probably
not quite what the public expects to see from disabled performers, says
Ewan.
It did cross their minds, when Newham sent back the posters that, yet
again, they were up against certain gut-feelings about disabled people
in general. ''Frankly, they are not expected to behave so badly,'' Ewan
laughs. But, as he points out, such expectations are no joking matter.
He's constantly made aware, even by the most well-intentioned folk,
that the disabled really have very few rights. And being loud,
scatological, and sexually rampant -- albeit on stage -- is seen in some
quarters as inappropriate behaviour for someone in a wheelchair.
As he talks, the sheer rottenness of Ubu's swaggering regime takes on
the gloss of our own society where everyone seems to be studying for
A-level hypocrisy. Yes, says Ewan, talks with the BBC have opened up
windows of opportunity for disabled actors and writers. But the doors of
the various buildings remain too narrow for wheelchair access.
''And the colleges are always apologetic -- but what about safety?
What if there's a fire?'' Almost as if she's picking up on Ewan's
conversation, Lara Bowen -- current administrator of Glasgow-based Birds
of Paradise -- is talking about the problems that face disabled actors
who want to train as professionals.
In a bid to offset this training deficit, Birds of Paradise -- who
have pioneered mixed-ability theatre in Scotland -- are currently
running a series of Monday afternoon professional drama classes at
Strathclyde Arts Centre. I met up with Lara, and with Andy Dawson and
Fiona Millar (who are leading the 11-week course) after the second
session. Already there was a strong sense of positive feedback among the
group whose ages range from the twenties to the fifties.
That day's programme had focused on voice work. Breathing exercises,
vocalisation techniques, ways of using sounds expressively -- Fiona and
the group had gone well beyond words as they explored different avenues
of communication.
No one, however, pretends that any of it -- the training, the job
hunting, the performing -- is easy. Ewan Marshall, of Graeae, ruefully
says he doesn't know what's more soul destroying. Being ignored or being
patronised. With Ubu -- which one critic gleefully described as ''a
Quentin Tarantino reading of Punch and Judy'' -- Graeae cock a snook at
stuffed shirt attitudes to disability. And no one in the Traverse
audience will applaud louder than the Birds of Paradise crowd who are in
training to make dramatic waves of their own.
Ubu is at the Traverse, Edinburgh, until Sunday.

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Health Service quangos should meet in public in a move to end
the climate of secrecy and fear in the service, the Nolan inquiry into
standards in public life was told yesterday.
''Gagging clauses'' which stop NHS staff from speaking out about their
concerns should also be scrapped, said Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary
of the technical union MSF.
He told the Nolan Committee that appointments to NHS bodies should be
politically balanced and responsibility for them should be taken away
from the Government.
His union's report to the committee said many health service staff
were concerned at the effects on patient care of the new, sometimes
''excessively vigorous'', commercial ethos in the NHS.
''It is no exaggeration to say that a climate of fear now exists
within the NHS, and this has given rise to considerable staff concern
about the issue of freedom of speech,'' the report said.
The only way to tackle excessive secrecy was to introduce an
independent element, with staff able to take concerns beyond management,
perhaps to the health service ombudsman.
0 Labour MP for Workington, Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, a long-standing
critic of MPs being allowed to accept paid lobbying work and other
private interests, urged the appointment of an Ethics Registrar for
Parliament.
The registrar, supported by a secretariat, would investigate
complaints about MPs and Ministers, and would report to Parliament and,
if necessary, the Prime Minister.
Conservative Iain Duncan Smith, MP for Chingford, said he believed
some of the problems surrounding MPs' interests could be solved by
''complete and utter disclosure''.

missing. A tenor saxophonist in the John Coltrane tradition, Skidmore
plays with a level of commitment that can be all but overpowering but
which is balanced by an ever-present control.
This made his pairing with John Burgess an interesting and contrasting
departure from the two-tenors-going-for-it approach which often results
in these situations. Burgess develops his solos tangentially,
occasionally overblowing but with a light tone, whereas Skidmore's tone
is dark and his solos always build from deep within the song structure.
They chose several pieces with Coltrane associations. Skidmore's first
half feature of Mal Waldron's gorgeous Soul Eyes carefully avoided
dewy-eyed sentiment and Coltrane's racing, modal Impressions drew
forthright, impassioned statements from both players.
The latter also featured a terrific solo from pianist David Milligan
which began in minimalist fashion and developed into something halfway
between the volcanic and the rhapsodic. Milligan is rapidly becoming the
pianist to watch in Scotland and worked well with bassist Kenny Ellis
(good sound, harmonically confident), although the rather excitable
drummer Tom Gordon undermined their good work before finally settling
down in the second half.
Burgess's effective bass clarinet reading of In A Sentimental Mood and
Skidmore's wry, wily Weaver of Dreams formed a lull before the storm
that was Mr PC, an exhaustive romp through Coltrane's tribute to bassist
Paul Chambers that left the band apparently drained and the audience
utterly replete.

ENTITLED Baroque and Celtic Charms, last night's programme from the
John Currie stable blended an intriguing mix of the familiar and the
unknown. Standards from Vivaldi and Bach preceeded the surprise --
Morris Pert's Ancient Rites.
Commissioned in the early eighties by The John Currie Singers, Ancient
Rites (subtitled Nine Incantations from the Hebridean Isles), is scored
for 16 solo voices and a small string orchestra. Inspired by the
nineteenth-century Gaelic manuscript Carmina Gadelica, the piece
juxtaposes a potentially dangerous combination of the sacred and the
secular.
Last night's was an atmospheric performance casting enchanting spells
and dropping moments of magic. Four solo episodes for soprano
Caroline-Louise Fairbrother, mezzo Colette Ruddy, tenor Dennis Haggerty
and bass John Beazley projected simple, affecting folk tunes. Ruddy's
voice fell like a breath of fresh air -- rich and impassioned, her
singing came deep from within. Choral sections revealed a versatile
ensemble.
Earlier Vivaldi's Gloria failed to shine like the baroque jewel that
it really is. Dragging tempi and lacklustre expression produced a
somewhat pedantic performance save Ruddy's divine Domine Deus. With
obbligato roles for oboe, trumpet, and harpsichord, Barbara Rhodes,
Sandy McGrattan, and John Langdon respectively were able to reveal their
instrumental virtuosity.
The same cannot be said for violinists Clive Thomas and Brian Hale --
their execution of Bach's Double Concerto left much to be desired. Both
able soloists in their own right, the balance was all wrong, Bach's
delightful outer dance movements failing to come to life.

A SCOTLAND Yard accountant at the centre of a #5m fraud investigation
was committed to Southwark Crown Court for trial yesterday after 38 new
charges were laid against him.
Mr Anthony Williams, 54, originally faced two charges of theft of
money from the Metropolitan Police, but when he appeared before Bow
Street magistrates yesterday, he faced four more charges of theft. Crown
Prosecutor Gareth Julian said Williams, of Vanfame Court, Dukes Avenue,
New Malden, Surrey, had also been charged with another 34 counts of
theft, involving an estimated total value of #700,000.

SAT like a 'cello player with his electric bass, Weber explained the
technology that allows him to produce a multi-layered sound from just
the one instrument. Truth to tell, there is little new in what he does,
although digital delay allows him to pile phrase upon phrase and drone
upon harmonic. John Martyn was doing this sort of thing on the guitar --
and John Surman on the saxophone -- many years ago.
Both of them, however, used the technique as a basis for biting attack
that is alien to the German's ECM-label sound. Weber's music sometimes
makes the most ambient of chill-out sounds seem like punk rock. Mesmeric
yes, but a tad soporific. He heaped on some astonishing bowed harmonics
-- and a trumpet-like effect by playing near the bridge -- but it was
his own playing sans FX that was most impressive. ''Unaccompanied''
pieces like the opening Seven Movements, or the hoedown of Children's
Song No 1 were the pick of the set.
Saxophonist Tommy Smith and Murray McLachlan, who opened the concert,
also played a couple of Children's Songs, but from the pen of Chick
Corea. Their duo is potentially one of the most exciting partnerships to
emerge in Scottish music in a while. In a programme framed by two
four-movement sonatas by Smith, they included Satie, Grieg, Bartok, and
Poulenc. Smith was in Jan Garbarek territory with Grieg's Arietta, but
made it his own, while the reading of Satie's Gnossienne No 1 -- a
Glasgow brasserie favourite thanks to its film soundtrack use -- was
another highlight.

A POLICE sergeant yesterday told how an attempt to arrest a violent
schizophrenic ended in the death of a young police constable in a
Glasgow street.
Constable Lewis Fulton, 28, died from a stab wound last June after he
answered an SOS call from fellow officers who were trying to arrest an
18-year-old man in the Gorbals.
He was yesterday posthumously awarded the Chief Constable's Very High
Commendation, the highest bravery award which can be given to a
policeman.
His widow, Christine, accepted the award from Councillor James
Jennings, convener of Strathclyde region's police and fire committee.
Chief Constable Leslie Sharp offered Mrs Fulton words of encouragement
at the ceremony, and later showed her an exhibit dedicated to her late
husband in the force's museum at its Pitt Street headquarters.
The exhibit contains items collected by his mother to reflect his
school life, interests and, in particular, his achievements in swimming
and lifesaving.
Constable Fulton's parents and his 15-month-old son Luke, also
attended the ceremony. Seven police colleagues who attended the incident
received the same award.
Sergeant William Blair, 33, who suffered a stab wound to his arm, told
how officers attended a family disturbance at a house in Norfolk Street
in Glasgow's Gorbals.
Constable Fulton had gone to assist colleagues who were having
difficulty in arresting the man. He was stabbed in the chest and died a
short time later in the city's Victoria Infirmary.
McFadden was arrested after being pursued along several busy streets
after leaving the house. More than 30 police officers were involved in
the operation.
In October, he was ordered to be detained at the State Hospital in
Carstairs, Lanarkshire, after doctors declared him insane at the time of
the attack.
Mr Fulton's widow, said: ''I was very, very proud of Louie. He was a
wonderful husband and father. This award confirms to me that the police
were very proud of him as well.''
She revealed that her husband had previously been injured three times
while on duty, but said he never backed away from anything.
''What he did was totally in character. There was no way he would
leave a fellow officer. He would go to his assistance every time,'' she
said.
* Every officer in Strathclyde is now trained in the use of the
side-handled baton and quick cuffs.

AS DISABLED rights demonstrators staged a mass lobby of Parliament
yesterday, Labour challenged the Government on whether it aimed to block
backbench disabled rights legislation when it comes up for its second
reading in the Commons today.
Shadow Leader of the House, Ann Taylor told MPs that she had received
a letter from the Minister for Disabled People, William Hague, making
clear he would not be asking the House to support the backbench Bill
today.
She warned: ''The thousands of people who are here to lobby their MPs
will be extremely concerned at that reply.''
A similar Bill was quashed when it was talked out by Tory backbenchers
last year, provoking a furious response from the disabled.
Commons Leader Tony Newton told her he was sure Mr Hague ''will seek
to explain the whole position more fully in his speech tomorrow'' to the
House.
Disabled rights campaigners supporting today's measure by Mr Harry
Barnes (Derbyshire North-East -- Lab) complain that the Government's own
legislation, the Disability Discrimination Bill, does not go far enough.
Speaker Betty Boothroyd yesterday brushed aside a complaint from Mr
Barnes over the treatment of the disabled people lobbying Westminister.
He protested in a point of order that loudspeakers for MPs to address
lobbyists had been removed by the Commons authorities despite some
disabled people having hearing problems.
Miss Boothroyd replied: ''The best possible facilities have been made
available by this House and its authorities for the use of Westminister
Hall which holds something like 1500 people.''
She said that everything possible was done to see that those who were
lobbying reached their MPs and that they were able to meet them.

EXCLUSIVE
THE 10-year fight to unlock the treasures of Sir William Burrell will
spill out into the public domain in a final showdown later this year.
The trustees, set up to watch over the collection housed in Pollok
Park in Glasgow, are to challenge an attempt by the district council to
overturn stringent conditions which bar any part of it from travelling
overseas.
They have officially objected to what is, in effect, a private Bill
being promoted through Parliament by the council. If successful it will
allow the council to vary the terms of Sir William Burrell's 1944
agreement and a later 1957 codicil.
The trustees' decision means the matter is now set to be decided at an
inquiry before Parliamentary Commissioners, members of the Houses of
Lords and Commons, in public in Glasgow this summer.
The parliamentary action is the third and final attempt to free the
8500 artefacts left to Glasgow Corporation by Sir William. The council
has considered court action in the past but legal opinion described the
agreement as ''watertight'' and ruled out proposals to challenge it
through the courts.
Friction between the council and the trustees over the use of the
collection has been rising in recently. Only last month in a letter to
Glasgow's Museum director Julian Spalding the trustees threatened legal
action against the council for agreeing to let Burrell artefacts be
shown in Habitat in London.
Both parties have now come to an agreement to allow the Habitat
exhibition to go ahead but on the strict undertaking that the council
does not repeat it until the parliamentary action is decided.
The city council claims its inability to lend the treasures overseas
means that it can't get on the international gallery circuit and receive
works of art to show in Glasgow on a reciprocal basis.
Mr Tom Monaghan, Glasgow District Council's chief executive, said:
''The basic issue is that in order to maximise the value of the
collection for the people of Glasgow we would like to allow some of it
to go overseas.
''The parliamentary action is the only way we could identify to go
forward on this issue. The courts would have found it difficult to rule
on the matter.''
The trustees, while refusing to comment publicly on the issue
yesterday, are known to be extremely unhappy at the council's approach.
It is understood a number feel angered at the council's attempt to
overturn an agreement which they freely entered into thirty years ago.
They held a private meeting yesterday and are expected to release a
public statement on the issue next week.
The trustees' solicitor Mr Robert Taylor of Bannatyne, Kirkwood,
France and Co, said: ''The trustees are considering their position which
has not been finalised and may wish to respond at a later date.''
He said he was not in a position to disclose the names of the
trustees. However, in 1992, they included Mr Colin McDonald of McGrigor
Donald solicitors, Sir Peter Hutchison CBE, chairman of Glasgow
Insurance brokers Hutchison &amp; Craft, businessman and ship owner Mr Peter
Wordie, and Lady Shaw Stewart of Ardgowan.

IT was a carnival day in Dresden. That was how they celebrated Shrove
Tuesday on February 13, 1945, and Christine Otto had dressed up in a
Little Red Riding Hood costume. She had another reason for excitement.
It was her fifth birthday.
That was why she thought it was a special fireworks display for her
benefit. The sirens had sounded. The adults had headed for the cellar
beneath the family home in the Rossebaude suburb of Dresden. The young
ones slipped off into another cellar which had been prepared like a
nursery with toys.
Strictly against regulations, there was an unblacked-out window there
through which the child looked out at a reddened sky flashing with the
first bombs and incendiaries.
She rushed through to the adults to tell them about the fireworks.
Their response was frightening. They were in tears. ''Our poor
Dresden,'' was all that was said. For the rest of her life Christine's
birthdays have been memorials.
Rudiger Eckardt was nine years older, still a boy learning Latin and
Greek at the Kreuzschull (Cross School) in the mornings, considered old
enough to have been drafted into national service in the Nazi
Volkswohlfahrt as a welfare aide in the afternoons. He wore the NSV
arm-band over his school uniform. He was on soup kitchen duties for the
thousands of refugees who fled in daily from the East to Hauptbanhof,
the main station. They would number among the highest casualties of the
bombings.
''It had always been believed that Dresden would not be bombed because
it was an artistic centre,'' he recalls. ''When you need to, you will
believe nonsense. When the attacks came there was absolutely no warning,
and Dresden did not have any bunkers like the cities in Western Germany.
''We made for the cellar and the noise cracked, crashed and roared. My
second oldest sister came through the flames and the burning streets,
trying to reach our home in Racknitz. She was on foot, trying to avoid
the burning buildings and she made it as the second wave of bombers came
in. She had her little boy, one-year-old, in her arms. She had reached
us from the city centre.
''It was over finally. We left Dresden to stay with relatives. On the
way out of the city there were the first dead bodies I had seen in my
life. It was terrible. Mutilated corpses. Just meat and bones. Pictures
you can't forget for the rest of your life. Even in German it's
difficult to express it . . .''
Like many of the Dresdeners I spoke with, he was remarkably
philosophical about the event. I asked him if he still felt any anger.
''No,'' he scorned. ''Against the English? No, it was war, killing,
murder. Hitler started the war and the Luftwaffe bombed London,
Coventry, Newcastle and other cities. But I will say that the
destruction of Dresden was not necessary for victory. The war was
decided.
''The only anger I understand among Dresdeners was over the visit of
the Queen in 1992. It was the worst time because they had raised that
statue for Harris. Old wounds were opened. The Queen never laid a
wreath, she never said any words of regret, and she drove past the
ruined Frauenkirche without even stopping.''
Typical of the courtesy with which I was received by Dresdeners, even
those stopped on the streets of the city, was the response of
84-year-old Ilse Findeklee when I arranged to meet her at her home in
Striessen. She asked what hospitality she should provide. A meal? Coffee
and cakes?
A remarkably alert octogenarian, she laughed as she described the city
she had first come to live in with her husband in 1937. It was a posh
city where people reminded you to wear a hat. The restaurants, contacts
with foreigners, cabarets, cinemas and cafes were part of a city that
had its own reputation in Saxony. It was said that Chemnitz was where
people worked, Leipzig was for commerce, and Dresden was for culture,
festivals and partying.
The mood turned to tears as she remembered the bombing, her swollen
hands agitating with a handkerchief. ''In the cellar, here below this
house, there were 40 people squeezed in. They had jumped off the trams
and run anywhere for shelter. The bricks of the cellar began to move up
and down because of the air pressure and the bombing. I thought the
world was going to collapse.
''Angry? No, I'm just happy I survived. If I felt anger or hatred it
wouldn't change anything. The only thing is, unification of Germany came
too late for me. The rebuilding will be finished later. But it is too
late for me to travel now.''

SEVERAL airports in the Highlands and Islands could face disruption
unless a management proposal to impose wage cuts of 12.5% is removed,
three trades unions warned last night.
Inverness, Benbecula, and Stornoway airports are among those which
could be targeted.
The trades unions, representing more than 200 workers employed by
Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd, warned that the proposal was
''completely unacceptable''.
The unions involved are the Transport and General Workers' Union, the
Civil and Public Services Association, and the Institution of
Professionals, Managers and Scientists.
HIAL is at present a subsidiary of the Civil Aviation Authority. From
April 1 it will come under the control of the Scottish Office and will
be required to reduce its wage bill to comply with Government pay
policy.
The unions are angered at yesterday's management proposal to reduce
earnings by about #500,000 a year by removing premium shift, weekend and
holiday payments.
Management has proposed to buy out the allowances with a one-off lump
sum of #500,000, to be shared between the employees.
Mr Michael McCann, Scottish officer of the CPSA, said last night:
''The company threatened that if our members refused to accept such a
pay cut that HIAL would have to achieve savings by cutting jobs or by
closing airports at weekends.''
The unions are seeking authority to ballot their members for
industrial action.
Mr Paul Jenkins, HIAL general manager, said last night: ''We have no
choice in the matter. We must reduce our wage bill.''

Brussels,
ALEX FALCONER, the Scottish Euro-MP leading the campaign to save
Clause 4 in Labour's constitution, yesterday claimed a breakthrough when
he won unanimous support from the southern and eastern regional council
of the TUC.
Mr Falconer, author of the Guardian advertisement which enraged Labour
leader Tony Blair on his recent visit to Brussels, said: ''This support
comes from the bedrock of the Labour movement, not from some
ultra-leftist fringe. Also significant is that it comes from the area
which the so-called modernisers think is essential to our electoral
success.''
He added: ''The regional council motion also stated that the debate
was unnecessary, divisive and damaging. I couldn't agree more. It should
not have been launched in such a public and unilateral fashion.
Preferably it should not have been launched at all.''
Since the advertisement appeared, carrying the endorsement of more
than half of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, the campaign in
favour of Clause 4 has claimed it is attracting more support.
Mr Falconer said this was very encouraging. ''I think that we are
getting our message across that there can be no social justice without
economic justice.''
He claimed support for retention of the clause from the Transport and
General Workers' Union, the RMT and Aslef, despite speculation that Mr
Blair could eventually rely on a union block vote to get his way.
Mr Falconer, Labour Euro-MP for Mid Scotland and Fife, called on
Scottish members of Labour's national executive to reflect Scottish
opinion in their discussions in London. Mr Blair's campaign for the
abolition of Clause 4 comes to Scotland next week.
Mr Falconer said 26 Scottish constituency parties so far had supported
retention of the clause. Asked what would happen if the Scottish Labour
Party voted to retain Clause 4 but the party elsewhere in the UK voted
against it, he replied: ''At the end of the day we are all part of the
same party."
He said: ''The question you should be asking is: why is that Scottish
representatives on the NEC are not reflecting concern in Scotland?''

Monday is the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Dresden, the most
controversial operation conducted by the Allies to secure victory in the
Second World War. A beautiful city was levelled by 3,500 tons of bombs
and incendiaries dropped in successive waves by Bomber Command and the
US 8th Air Force, creating a firestorm which claimed up to 250,000
lives. JOHN LINKLATER has been in Dresden talking to survivors, and to a
new generation witnessing the city's rebirth. And he has spoken to RAF
men involved in the operation.
SHE is in love with her home city of Dresden. Born 20 years after the
destruction of February 13, 1945, she says it is still a part of her
life. Heike Thorenz, a teacher, knows the lost city from photographs,
from anecdotes and history, from the eighteenth-century cityscapes of
Bellotto (called Canaletto), like infra-red images of a partially
restored, partially obliterated masterpiece. She shares the pride and
pain of Dresden's recovery.
We are in a hotel lobby and she points out of the window down Prague
Street. ''That was our Oxford Street,'' she says. ''It was full of shops
selling beautiful jewellery and furs, cafes full of laughter,
restaurants and dance halls. The heart and soul of Dresden.''
Today it is a pedestrianised hollow between concrete cliffs of
tenements, cheerless canopies and an eccentric circular cinema. They may
have taken down the statue of Lenin opposite what is now a Burger King
on the corner, but we are staring at the unmistakable legacy of the GDR
and a misguided notion of architectural progress.
This was depressingly predictable. It confirmed the 1995 Dresden I had
imagined and dreaded, but I was to discover quickly that it was only one
part of the story. Like so many projected images of Dresden, it was a
distortion of the truth. Retrospectively, we may have tried to
rationalise the destruction. We imagine, if Dresden was bombed to
rubble, it must have been a centre of heavy industry. This is manifestly
untrue.
Dresden is no more industrialised than Edinburgh. In 1945 its most
provocative output was Dresden china figures (more precisely from
Meissen, 20 km down the Elbe) and the supply of army uniforms. It
manufactured Elbflorenz (Florence on the Elbe, the city's pre-war boast)
marzipan and Exquisit brand oriental cigarettes.
There was no armaments production. Dresden did not appear on any of
Air Vice-Marshal Bottomley's Annexes 'A' and 'B' of February 14, 1942,
listing primary industrial targets, alternative industrial areas or
subsidiary targets. Two years later its annihilation was justified as
elimination of an important communications centre, yet the trains were
running out of the shell of the main station, Hauptbanhof, two days
after the attacks by Bomber Command and the US 8th Air Force.
Some Dresdeners today believe the city was destroyed because of
cultural envy. This reflects an embattled attitude which has more to do
with 50 years of intense rivalry with Berlin. Immediately after the war
one of the proposals from the GDR capital was to rebuild Dresden on a
completely new site. Dresdeners are proud people with clear goals. They
forestalled this second potential catastrophe by raising the
eighteenth-century Zwinger Palace themselves, by public subscription
along with Dresden sweat, muscle and loving care. That set the agenda
for the city's recovery.
The stoical progress of this achievement explains the intense pride of
the younger generation. Heike Thorenz says: ''This says something about
the character of the people here. They are very conscious of their
history. I'll never forget the day the Semper Opera House reopened in
1984. The whole family gathered in front of the television set and we
were crying. It was another piece of Dresden given back to the
Dresdeners.''
She breaks the interview to ask if it is not too late for us to go on
a tour of the historic heart of the city. I have only arrived in the
city hours before, and she realises she is describing buildings I have
not yet seen. It is after midnight as she drives us away from the
misconceived modernism of the new Prague Street and within minutes we
turn towards a stunning baroque splendour.
Nothing can prepare the imagination for the architectural confection
of the Zwinger, an elegant fantasy in pale sandstone. It was rebuilt
brick by brick, like a jigsaw. Standing before it is a humbling
experience. The paradox is that you have to see the restoration to
appreciate the magnitude of the destruction.
Dresden was a British and American war crime. All wars inflict
inevitable barbarism, and the total war that was being waged in the
early months of 1945 witnessed the revelations with the liberation of
Auschwitz and the indiscriminate strikes on London civilians through V1s
and V2s; but the political decision to hit Dresden was a disastrous
mistake.
Even a just war against the evil of Nazism should have been restrained
from visiting its pitilessness on a city as beautiful and innocent as
Dresden for no other reason than terror.
Dresden registers a continuing guilt and shame. It was Germany's
Hiroshima, with a higher mortality rate. The figure will never be known.
The city was packed to more than double its normal population of
500,000. It was swollen with refugees as the Soviet Red Army drove west
from Silesia. No records exist for the vast majority of the dead. They
were piled on pyres in the centre of the city. The often-quoted figure
of 35,000 is almost certainly a gross under-estimate, promoted by the
GDR to minimise acknowledgement of the West's brutal power.
Estimates in Dresden are of a death rate as high as 250,000. The
incendiary pattern of bombing (1,182 tons added to 1,478 tons of high
explosives in the two waves of Bomber Command attacks delivered by 796
Lancasters) created a furnace, then a hurricane of fire that sucked in
victims and carbonized them. Or they died by suffocation in cellars,
mildly preferable to being baked alive.
The next day survivors were strafed on streets, in parks, under
bridges and on the banks of the Elbe, into which they were trying escape
the flames, by American Mustang fighters. They had escorted 311 American
B-17s, from which another 771 tons of bombs were dropped on the corpse
of Dresden. It was Ash Wednesday.
For its part, Dresden seeks reconciliation. Memorial events mounted by
the city have consistently incorporated exhibitions, seminars, lectures
and films to pay respect to the 50th anniversay of the liberation of
Auschwitz. A Peace Forum Dresden will be launched on Sunday. Nick Nolan,
mayor of Coventry, is among the main guests at Monday's commemoration,
and the Duke of Kent will take part in the wreath-laying ceremony.
The Mayor of Dresden, Herbert Wagner, says: ''We must not consider the
destiny of our city in isolation. One who says Dresden must also be
aware of others, of St Petersburg and Coventry.''
In 1976 Kurt Vonnegut wrote that the Dresden catastrophe was so
meaningless, finally, that only one person on the entire planet got any
benefit from it. ''One way or another, I got two or three dollars for
every person killed,'' he gave as a characteristically black
self-indictment. He was being unfair on himself. Slaughterhouse-Five,
based on eye-witness experience as an American POW in Dresden during the
firestorm, played an honourable part in changing the attitudes of
younger generations of readers to the conduct of an operation approved
by Allied chiefs of staff and political leaders. The novel also gives
one of the best one-line descriptions of the devastation that was left.
Billy Pilgrim says it looked like the moon.
In Dresden I found the slaughterhouse. An articulated lorry came out
through the barrier gate and headed south. There were plaques with heads
of cattle on the wall. And there was an address above a heavy metal gate
with its square grille: Schlachthofring 5.
This is a city which contains the echoes of many famous visitors.
Johann Sebastian Bach played the priceless Silbermann organ that was
smashed to fragments when the Frauenkirche, the most reknowned
Protestant cathedral in Europe, succumbed to temperatures of up to 2000
degrees and toppled two days after the final bombing attack. Mozart
played in the Catholic Hofkirche in 1789. Dostoevsky gambled. Wagner,
Richard Strauss and Weber had their premieres staged at the Semper
Opera.
Gerhart Hauptmann looked on the ruins in February, 1945, and said:
''Whoever has forgotten how to weep will learn it again with the
destruction of Dresden.''
Reconstruction work has accelerated since unification in 1989. Large
private houses lie empty up in the unscathed residential area of
Loschwitz over the Blue Wonder Bridge. They are subject of protracted
ownership claims, or building costs have proved prohibitive for their
owners. Consortia, large and small, take on individual projects.
Dresdeners watch with keen interest.
At the magnificent Kempinski Hotel, faithfully restored from the
rubble of the Taschenbergpalais between the Castle and the Zwinger, they
have counted 6000 citizens who have accepted the open day invitation
over a single weekend since the doors were reopened in January.
The biggest project of all is the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche at a
cost of more than #100 million over a decade. Replacing each stone is
estimated at #1250. Until last year the rubble lay heaped inside the two
remaining shards of gable that stood like a rotten molar. The midnight
vigil at this site each February 13 began an unofficial peace movement
and a silent protest for freedom that had begun to trouble the GDR
authorities in their last years.
The project has divided opinion in Dresden. Older citizens wanted it
left as a memorial to the folly of war. Younger generations regard it as
a symbol of reborn Dresden.
Heike Thorenz says: ''To preserve even the ruin was costing millions.
Just to keep it standing up. My father is a construction engineer and he
was involved with the project. I think, for the silhouette of Dresden,
the same one that Canaletto painted, it's very important that it be
reconstructed. It should go up, and so will Dresden.''

ONE of the longest-running transfer deals in Scottish football took a
step closer to completion last night when Airdrie FC received outline
planning permission for a #7m stadium on a green belt site at Raebog on
the outskirts of the town.
But the decision enraged some people from the nearby village of
Glenmavis, who have set up a pressure group to lobby against the
proposed stadium.
Several protesters demonstrated outside the district council's
headquarters before the meeting, and stormed out of the public gallery
when the committee approved outline permission for the 10,000-capacity
ground.
Protesters spokesman Steve Taylor called the planning process a
pointless sham, claiming the council was determined to allow what he
described as ''an assault on the green belt'' to go ahead.
The protest group, Glenmavis Opposes Airdrieonians Location of
Stadium, (GOALS) has a petition signed by 746 people, and 355 letters of
objection were also lodged.
The club's application for the Raebog site had been recommended by the
council's director of planning, Mr David Cooper.
After the meeting, Mr Taylor said the protesters would now be
demanding that Strathclyde Regional Council call in the application and
would be writing to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, urging his
intervention.
The region's department of physical planning has objected to the
application.
Airdrie have been seeking a new home for four years after selling
their old ground, Broomfield, to Safeway for a new supermarket.

Dwindling choice and less fresh, local produce appears to flow from
more centralised food distribution. Catherine Brown argues that, despite
the apparent trend, there is a viable alternative we would be Off Our
Trolleys not to pursue
I AM not a regular Wm Low customer, but every now and again I used to
go in for a bag of Donald MacDonald's Alford oatmeal, a tub of
Scots-Italian Rizza Gold Top ice-cream, and John MacArthur's Koepon
yogurt.
Before its takeover by Tesco, Low's policy of supporting small
Scottish producers meant that these, and other locally produced foods,
found a regular shelf space. At the branch in Milngavie the other day,
the Alford oatmeal was still there but the Rizza ice-cream and the
Koepon yogurts had gone.
Was Tesco starting to delist Scotland's small producers? I complained,
of course. There was a complaints book at the newspaper stand, but the
assistant couldn't find it. She would write it down on a piece of paper
and see that it was passed on. I could also fill in a form and send it
to head office.
But no amount of complaining can change a system which makes it
difficult for small local food companies to retain their presence on the
supermarket shelves. Tesco's intentions, according to MacDonald,
MacArthur and Philip Morrison for Rizza's, are -- for the moment --
honourable.
The small food company, however, joins a formidable distribution
system geared to dealing with large manufacturers delivering seven days
a week, in colossal volume, to a central distribution point.
''At the moment we are still sorting out the long-term distribution of
produce in Scotland,'' said Simon Uwins, Tesco's trading director. ''The
takeover has been a very complex business and a few Scottish producers
have gone, but our commitment is to preserve as much of the Scottish
food and drink industry as possible. In some cases there is also the
opportunity for Scottish producers to sell in England.''
For small producers like MacArthur, however, there is still the
problem of delivering his yogurts six days a week from Newton Stewart to
Tesco's CDP in Livingston. ''If they would take a three-day delivery for
small producers like us,'' said MacArthur, ''it would make a tremendous
difference.''
Morrison reported that Tesco had just closed the facility for frozen
food at the old Low's distribution depot in Livingston. Their ice-cream
must now be transported from Huntly to Manchester before it is trucked
back into Tesco stores around Scotland.
Bright modern supermarkets may have expanded the food horizons of
millions but lurking behind the shelves is a system of food retailing
which some argue needs a policy rethink.
Are we Off Our Trolleys? asks a report from the Institute for Public
Policy Research, a charitable body set up in 1988 as an alternative to
free-market think-tanks. Authors, Hugh Raven and Tim Lang, suggest that
the huge growth of the supermarkets in the last couple of decades has
created a food retailing monopoly with hidden social and environmental
costs which are not visible to the millions of shoppers.
Prolific quantities of Vale of Evesham asparagus can be sprouting in
the fields while the local supermarket trucks in bundles of the green
shoots from Spain. Scottish fields can be bristling with oats while the
only available oatmeal in the supermarket hails from England. Specialist
Scottish Italian ice-cream makers can be making superb ice-cream at
reasonable prices yet they are pushed off the shelves by more expensive
Haagen Dazs.
The alternatives to this apparently environmentally damaging and
expensive system of transporting food around the world are slowly
disappearing.
Local markets, where small producers bring their produce to sell
direct, have not been encouraged. What independent food shops there are
left may continue to attract a loyal following, but they are also under
threat of extinction. Direct marketing is a solution which has been
developed in the US, where producers supply their goods directly to the
consumers. In Japan, the produce of a group of 30 farmers from a village
an hour's drive from Tokyo has been brought to over one million
households through a direct marketing initiative.
Compared with the central distribution system operated by the
supermarkets which clocks up thousands of ''food miles'' daily, this may
sound like a better option. But could the nation be fed, efficiently, if
the system changed? Do the small growers/producers seemingly most at
risk from the might of the multiples really want to go back to the old
days?
Supermarkets are a mixed blessing is the conclusion of the Robert Owen
Foundation, managing and marketing agents for the successfully revived
consortium of Scotland's Tomatoes. We do not want to turn the clock
back, but a lot more could be done to sort out the grudges which exist
between growers/manufacturers and the supermarket buyers.
More time and money needs to be invested by the supermarkets educating
their buyers about the products they are buying. The culture of the
supermarket does not lend itself to understanding how food is grown and
manufactured in a local setting.
Nor does it lend itself, it would appear, to catering for low-income
groups and the old, whose access to cheaper foods at out-of-town
multiples is usually dependent on a car, which they don't have, or a bus
journey, which adds to the cost of their purchases.
Edge-of-town supermarkets, taking the business from small High Street
independent shops, has devastated the heart of many towns and cities and
taken food further away from the people. Only the Co-op has been willing
to site its supermarkets in deprived areas of inner cities. But since
the 1980s a new generation of independent food co-ops has developed.
Pioneered in Glasgow and supported by Strathclyde Regional Council,
there are now over 40 small co-ops around the country buying fresh
produce from local markets with minimum transport costs. They are not
dealing with large volume, but they do supply fresh produce at
reasonable prices to areas which have been abandoned by the big
supermarket chains and where the need for more fresh foods is arguably
greatest. Time for a policy rethink?

IN SPITE of the lukewarm response of English Liberal Democrats to the
idea of regional and national assemblies across Britain, the Scottish
party's parliamentary spokeswoman, Mrs Ray Michie, yesterday insisted
that a parliament in Edinburgh would be a springboard for a federal
United Kingdom.
Mrs Michie emphasised that the SLD agreement with Labour on the
details for a Scottish parliament were only a starting point to get the
legislature established.
She made clear that once it was operating, Liberal Democrats would
seek to change its funding mechanism to a system whereby all tax and
revenues generated in Scotland would be paid into a Scottish Exchequer,
which would ultimately pay its share to London for those services and
powers -- foreign policy, defence and macro-economics -- that remained
with the federal parliament at Westminster.
Speaking in Glasgow, she said: ''Federalism is the best answer to the
West Lothian question , because the federal Parliament would not
consider domestic affairs from any other part of the nation.
''Our plans for a Scottish parliament within a federal UK provide the
only coherent constitutional future for Scotland and Britain without
breaking the Union. Even Ian Lang has admitted that our plans have
intellectual integrity and balance.
''The English would have to decide what particular sort of parliament
they wanted. In the meantime, the number of Scots MPs at Westminster
should be reduced and the Secretary of State post abolished.''

THE LABOUR Party returned to the attack yesterday over the
Government's appointment of the chairmen who will run the three new
water services quangos.
Scottish Front Bencher John McFall singled out Dr Ian Preston, who
will head the East of Scotland Water Authority, and will be paid #24,000
a year for one and half day's work a week.
This was the third job Dr Preston had picked up this week, Mr McFall
told a local government conference in Peebles.
While he applauded any attempt to bring down the unemployment figures,
one individual holding down three jobs was hardly the way to go about
it.
Mr McFall said Dr Preston, who is retiring as the #255,000 a year
chief executive of ScottishPower, also had become chairman of the
privatised coal company Mining (Scotland), and had an appointment with
the industrial group Motherwell Bridge.
In view of the remuneration he would receive as water board chairman,
it was reasonable to expect that a public servant would devote all his
energies to the post in question, rather than fitting it in along with
his other considerable responsibilities, Mr McFall said.
He told the annual conference of the Scottish Region of the
Association of Direct Labour Organisations that the failure of the
Tories to win power at local authority level had led them to rely on
appointing people to influential and well-paid posts without making
public the criteria for the appointments.
Also addressing the conference Mr Robert Peggie, chairman of the Staff
Commission -- which advises Scottish Secretary Ian Lang over council
reorganisation -- emphasised the urgent need for the new councillors
elected in April to decide the future of the present Direct Labour
Organisations.
The options for the single- tier councils would include making joint
arrangements to keep the region-wide DLOs going or to establish their
own.
Mr Mark Irvine, Head of Local Government for the public services union
UNISON, urged caution over the possible extension of the use of joint
boards after council reorganisation.  He said they might be a necessary
evil but only in very limited circumstances.

LABOUR last night defended the ''adversarial'' style of political
interviewers such as the BBC's John Humphrys and Jeremy Paxman,
criticised last week by BBC Director General John Birt.
However, in the Commons debate on the future of the BBC, Shadow
National Heritage Secretary Chris Smith also urged broadcasters to
engage in more in-depth analysis.
Mr Smith said: ''If Mr Birt was telling the Today programme in a not
very coded fashion to be more gentle to Health Secretary Virginia
Bottomley, or indeed to me, I hope they will take no notice whatsoever
of him.''
In a speech in Dublin last Friday, Mr Birt criticised overbearing
interviewers who ''sneer disdainfully'' at their subjects.
Humphrys, who presents Radio 4's Today programme, and Paxman, of
television's Newsnight, were immediately assumed to be among his
targets.

DUNDEE'S economy took another blow yesterday with the announcement
that Sunblest Bakery will close making 94 workers redundant.
The bakery, owned by Allied Bakeries, has operated at its Lytton
Street site, in the west end of Dundee, for over 70 years.
Mr Pat Lally, manager of Northern Region Allied Bakeries, met the
workforce yesterday to break the bad news that production would be
transferred to the company's bakeries in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and
Glasgow. A small depot for 10 vans is to be maintained at the site.
Mr Lally said that the decision to close Dundee had been ''very
distressing''.
He added: ''The Dundee site is the smallest of our operations in
Scotland and the efforts of all of its loyal and valued workforce have,
until now, enabled it to overcome the disadvantages of its size in an
industry which continues to be as competitive as any in food
manufacturing.''

<HEADLINE>Outrage greets 1% pay award Furious nurses may change policy on action as teachers issue warning</HEADLINE>

NURSES' leaders are outraged by their 1% national pay award, while
teaching unions south of the Border are threatening industrial action
because of the effect on jobs and class sizes of their unfunded 2.7%
award.
Unison head of health Bob Abberley condemned the treatment of
Britain's 500,000 nurses as ''an appalling national scandal''. He said
they had been betrayed by the Government with an increase which will
give a staff nurse an insulting #2.17 extra a week.
The union would be launching a major campaign by nurses and the public
to force the Government to offer at least the 2.5% awarded to hospital
doctors.
Mrs Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of
Nursing, said the offer was not enough. Inflation had gone up, average
pay had gone up, and there were growing nursing shortages.
A spokeswoman for the Royal College of Midwives said its members could
be pushed towards withdrawing their goodwill and changing their policy
on industrial action as a result of the pay award.
''It is difficult to believe that the profession which cares for
800,000 women and their babies every year can be treated in such a
mean-minded manner. Two hundred and thirty branches are currently
discussing whether or not to change RCM policy on industrial action and
I fear that this award will be the final straw,'' said Mrs Yvonne
Hewins, director of employment affairs for the RCM.
She added that the Government was showing contempt for women and
women's health care.
Ms Julia Allison, the general secretary of the RCM, expressed her
''total disgust'' over the pay award.
''Morale in midwifery is at an all-time low already and this
scandalous pay award will make things even worse. It will inevitably
lead to job losses and cuts in services,'' she said.
Ms Jocelyn Prudence, of Professions Allied to Medicine, which
represents physiotherapists, radiographers, occupational therapists,
dieticians, chiropodists, and related staff, said the 1% award was
''disastrous, far worse than expected.
''The Government's local pay experiment will set trust against trust
and create divisions among staff. The reality of local pay will be
reduced staff morale, increased costs, and longer hours and less leave
for staff. This is about political dogma, not patient care.''
There was one rule for trust chief executives, who could earn more
than #100,000, and another for those involved in patient care, who once
again were short-changed, she said.
Mr Jim Devine, Unison's senior regional officer in Scotland, said the
pay award was an insult to the country's 70,000 nurses and midwives.
''We totally condemn this penny pay deal, at a time when inflation is
running at 2.9% and is set to rise to 3.5% in April.''
He also criticised the prospect of a further 1.5% being awarded to
staff by hospital trusts on the basis on performance-related pay. This,
said Mr Devine, was a divisive and demoralising tactic.
However, the awards were welcomed by Mr Roy Lilley, of the NHS Trust
Federation, who said trust hospitals could now negotiate locally with
doctors and nurses.
Teaching unions in England and Wales stressed that the lack of extra
cash to fund the 2.7% increase would mean lost teaching jobs and half of
primary school pupils in classes of more than 30 -- many as high as 40.
The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers said
the award was ''one unfunded settlement too many''. Its executive is to
recommend that its Easter conference authorise industrial action to
protect members faced with ''unreasonable class sizes''.
General secretary Nigel de Gruchy said: ''The demand for action from
our branches over class sizes is becoming irresistible.''
The smaller Association of Teachers and Lecturers also warned of the
danger of industrial action.
However, the biggest teaching union, the National Union of Teachers,
took a more measured line, with general secretary Doug McAvoy saying the
union would not be ''bounced'' into anything which would look like a
''Government victory''.
He said: ''Teachers will be demoralised that once again the Review
Body has toed the Government's line. Its job is to recruit, retain, and
motivate. This award does nothing for motivation.''
The tough Government line was greeted with dismay by local education
authorities, which say services have already been cut to the bone, and
school governors, who now face the responsibility of balancing budgets.
Chairman of the National Governors' Council Simon Goodenough said:
''School governors will be greatly disappointed that the Government has
ignored calls for full funding of the pay award.''
Mr Graham Lane, education chairman of the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities, said: ''This is disastrous. It means LEAs will not be able
to pay this award. There will be teacher redundancies and a dramatic
rise in class sizes.''
Although an education employer, he said: ''I do not blame NASUWT for
talking about industrial action. The award underpays teachers anyway and
the Government is not funding any of it.''

IT WAS not quite as good as Mr Tam Dalyell's famous one-word question
to a Minister -- ''why?'' but Mr Tony Blair still was quite effective
when he simply asked Mr Major yesterday if it was Government's
responsibility to reduce inequality.
Margaret Thatcher, caught in the right mood, might have replied
''no.'' Mr Major said ''yes.''
This produced loud, stagey, surprise ''Ohs'' from the large cast of
Labour extras and a rather shocked silence from the Government back
benches.
Mr Blair, on an each-way winner with that question, was sharp with his
follow-up. Figures showed that Britain was now a more unequal society
than at any time since the Second World War. He bolstered this by
contrasting the head of a privatised utility earning 70 times as much as
a teacher and 100 times as much as a nurse.
Mr Major was forced into a generalised defence of the action his
Government had taken to help those facing the greatest difficulties.
His problem was (a) he was unable to rebut Mr Blair's claim, as Mr
Blair pointed out, and (b) the cheers for his assertion that this was a
caring Government sounded less than convinced.
Mr Blair was ready with his punchline which was that the Government
had created a Britain which was ''divided, inefficient and unjust.'' Mr
Major, perhaps trying to make up for calling him a ''dimwit'' on
Tuesday, conceded ''It's an extremely good sound bite.'' It was not,
however, true.
The Prime Minister was also rather caught on the hop when Mr Clive
Soley (Hammersmith -- Lab.) again asked simply -- simple is best --
whether a single market free trade area did not inevitably imply a
single currency. Mr Major's brief pause seemed as good as a ''yes,'' to
the Opposition benches anyway.
This was all the more embarrassing as the Euro-sceptical wing of the
Tory Party in the persons of Mr Richard Tracey (Surbiton) and Mr
Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) had held the floor, the latter
praising Mr Major's ''robust and realistic'' stand on a single currency.
''There comes a moment when consensus becomes unanimity,'' the Prime
Minister said hopefully. There may well. However, a glance at the
thunderous visages of Sir Edward Heath, Mr Hugh Dykes and other
Europhiles, made clear that the moment had not arrived.
Critical claims that the Commons often conducts itself like an unruly
classroom of schoolboys received some backing when the unfortunate Mr
Ian Bruce (Dorset South -- Con.), trying to commend the virtues of
something in the upper reaches of the communications super-highway
mispronounced the Eurim report on it as what sounded like the ''Urine
report.''
The House was convulsed, especially when poor Mr Bruce tried again and
failed again. He did manage to mention something called ''Super Janet,''
which sounded like a hurricane. Mr Major, laughing as much as any one,
said the report sounded like a jolly good read anyway.
Some of the girls were laughing too, so the fact that the Commons is
no longer a single-sex school does not seem to have done much for its
sense of humour. It was unfortunate though, that it happened the day
after the Speaker had urged Members to make greater use of the richness
of the English language and aim for elegance.

A RAIL union leader yesterday defended Labour's Clause 4 -- but Labour
MP Glenda Jackson, who is sponsored by his union, spoke out for change.
Mr Lew Adams, general secretary of Aslef, said he would not trade off
support for a new constitution in return for a party pledge to
renationalise British Rail.
He emphasised that the union had ''a constitutional bond to the clause
and we are not about to give it up.''
His heart was with Clause 4, which was what Aslef sincerely believed
the party should stand for, and union delegates to Labour's special
conference in April would vote accordingly, he said in the latest issue
of his union journal.
In the same issue, Ms Jackson, the Aslef-sponsored MP for Highgate and
Hampstead, put the case for modernising the party constitution.
A Labour election victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, she
said, adding she would do everything in her power to guarantee a Labour
Government,including supporting Tony Blair and John Prescott in their
campaign to modernise the constitution.
Mr Adams called on the Labour Party to think again about letting the
first rail privatisation franchises run their full course before
passenger services were restored to public ownership.
He welcomed the announcement of a Labour Party working group on
proposals for restoring the railways to public ownership and public
accountability. He said he hoped the party meant what it said and that
it would be full nationalisation,as opposed to just taking the system
back under public control.

A WORK which -- in the words of its composer -- ''wavers between deep
despair, uncertain questioning, and violent appassionato outbursts'' is
quite likely to turn out to be by Kenneth Leighton. For all their
brevity, his Seven Variations Op 43 delivered their emotional message in
by no means uncertain terms at the start of last night's concert by the
new young quartet-in-residence at the Queen's Hall.
Each variation, and each change of mood, was keenly articulated.
Minutes of despair, but also moments of serenity, made their point. The
work may be pocket-sized, but it is one of Leighton's small
masterpieces. Though few people have hailed Chausson's unfinished string
quartet, Op 36, as a masterpiece, it too is a work of wavering moods,
now tender, now drooping. Long neglected by mainstream ensembles, it
proved well worth championing by young players such as these, who could
respond to its refined, sweet-toned, and very French melancholy.
What the many schoolchildren in the audience made of it is anybody's
guess, but from an early age I have loved Chausson's poetic grasp of
musical form, and still do.
The slow movement, a swaying dance, was a special treat -- more so, on
this occasion, than that of Dvorak's American quartet, which failed to
draw from the players the romance it needed. But the 'cellist -- the
only player allowed the luxury of a seat -- phrased ardently, and in the
rest of the work there was a finese that augered well for future
concerts.

GLASGOW University's educational achievements were recognised
yesterday by the Queen when she presented a Gold Medal to the
university's Chancellor, Sir Alec Cairncross, at the Queen's Anniversary
Prizes ceremony at Buckingham Palace.
The university has won the Queen's Anniversary Prize for ''outstanding
educational achievement in areas of service and benefit to the nation''.
The prize is in recognition of the university's efforts to make its
resources available to the wider public. These range from its visitor
centre to its extensive programme of adult classes and distance-
learning courses. Also included are the university's public lectures,
concerts, and exhibitions, the work of the Student Volunteer Service,
and the work of the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery with handicapped
and disadvantaged groups.
The award was one of only 21 made nationwide and Glasgow University
was the only winner from the West of Scotland.
Representatives of the university, including the Principal, Sir
William Fraser, and staff who have been involved in many of the
activities recognised by the award, attended a banquet.

THE Broadcasting for Scotland campaign was given a firm endorsement by
National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell last night when he warned
BBC governors to respect BBC Scotland's national cultural identity.
In a Commons debate on the future of the corporation, Mr Dorrell said
he would expect the BBC to ''introduce some precision'' into its policy
on encouraging the production of programmes in Scotland.
He read out from last summer's White Paper, which called on the BBC to
diminish its centralisation in London and to ''take a reasonable
proportion of network production from the nations and regions'' of the
UK.
Mr Dorrell said he agreed with expectations that the BBC respect this
commitment and added: ''I expect the BBC will want to include some
precisions about the nature of this undertaking.''
Campaigners in Scotland have complained that the BBC so far has shown
no willingness to put into practice the Government's call for the BBC to
devolve programme-making away from London and reflect in its output the
totality of British culture beyond the Home Counties.
Last night, Mr Nigel Smith, chairman of the Broadcasting for Scotland
Campaign, welcomed what he described as Mr Dorrell's assurances: ''I
thought it was a fairly strong signal to the BBC. Mr Dorrell has given
us the assurances we have been looking for.''
He added: ''The Government has produced a White Paper which meets many
of our concerns. The BBC response, despite its assurances, has been
cynical, calculated and inadequate.''
The campaign claims that the BBC's decision to relocate #75m worth of
production outside London in response to the White Paper is offset by
the #40m taken from regional programming and #55m in network programmes
centralised from the regions in recent years.
Earlier, the campaign received support from Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang. In a letter to Mr Smith, Mr Lang said he was campaigning within
the Government and the BBC to ensure that broadcasting in Scotland is
encouraged.
Mr Lang said: ''I take a close interest in the future of broadcasting
in Scotland. I have made my views known to my colleagues in Government
and to the Director-General of the BBC.''
Speaking in the debate, Mr Robert Maclennan, MP for Caithness and
Sutherland, said Scottish licence fee-payers had the right to ''hear and
see something of their own lives''.
He said 85% of the BBC's output originated in London, and 97% in
England. Only 3% was made in Scotland and Wales. ''I don't think the
general public is impressed with that distribution.''
Scottish Nationalist MP Mr Andrew Welsh said: ''The BBC is weakening
the loyalty and effectiveness of its Scottish staff, and the impact of
its Scottish output by holding so tightly to the reins of London
control. I believe that an independent, autonomous, Scottish
Broadcasting Company is required, completely free of outside control.''
During the debate, Mr Dorrell reaffirmed the Government commitment to
retaining the licence fee to support the BBC despite the corporation's
increasing commercial activities.
Shadow National Heritage Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the
continuation of the licence fee but criticised the Government's
intention to review it again before the end of 2001.
He demanded: ''Why put us through all the uncertainty all over again?
They could have given a longer-term perspective for the future of the
licence fee.''

FIFTY years later he entertains not the slightest qualm about Dresden.
It was his 21st operation with 166 Squadron of Bomber Command. He was
navigator of one of the 796 Lancaster bombers, taking part in the second
wave attack over the city in the early hours of February 14, 1945. ''We
were fighting for our lives,'' he says.
He talks about Dresden on condition that he is not named. Bomber
Command Association advises its members to refer questions to its
headquarters at RAF Museum, Hendon. ''We all want to keep to the same
line,'' says the navigator.
He was 22 at the time of the attack, a flying officer with two years'
training, an Edinburgh boy who remembered the land-mine in Gorgie that
killed civilians in 1941.
''I remember seeing German bombers streaming up the coast before
turning towards Clydebank. I was huddling in an Anderson Shelter,
thinking that one day I would get my chance of revenge.''
The operation over Dresden was ''routine''. Crews were briefed on the
day of the attack, as was normal procedure. He knew back then that
Dresden was a big city, famous for its cathedrals and its porcelain.
Briefings stressed the target's importance as a large communications
centre, a huge railway junction like Crewe, with troop concentrations
the Russians wanted to prevent moving up to reinforce the Eastern front.
''We were at war,'' he says. ''The war had not been won. The V2s were
being launched on London. The concentration camps were being liberated.
The Battle of the Bulge had not yet been fought.''
Although the operation had been planned meticulously, with elaborate
decoy runs in anticipation of strong German defence, it proved easier.
He remembers heavy flak, although many of the 80mm guns had been
diverted to the Eastern front. The Luftwaffe squadron at Dresden sat out
the whole of the attack on the tarmac. A ''communications breakdown'',
it was later claimed by the Germans.
''It has blurred into all the other operations. I knocked up 30 by the
end of the war. I never knew anything about the firestorm until I read
something in a newspaper two or three days later. When you finish an
operation you just wonder when the next one is coming. You had a duty to
do.
''That's war. Hindsight is a marvellous thing, and with Harris and all
the others now gone, it is easy to criticise. Next they will be blaming
Truman for bombing the Japanese. It couldn't have happened to a nicer
people, as far as I'm concerned, but I've got nothing against the
Germans.''
Bomber Command lost an estimated 56,000 crew over Europe the Second
World War. Records are still being sifted and some of the latest
estimates are put closer to 60,000. The average age of those involved in
the air was 20. Life depended on total trust and loyalty within the
crews of seven in a Lancaster bomber, and that unshakeable esprit de
corps holds even 50 years later, strenghtened perhaps by the denial of a
campaign medal for Bomber Command after the war, the vilification of its
commander-in-chief, Arthur Harris, and his exclusion from the peerage or
earldom that went virtually automatically to other wartime commanders.
Bomber Command veterans still seethe over a sense of ''tremendous
ingratitude'', as Anderson McCormack puts it. A Glasgow boy, he had just
joined 100 Squadron of Bomber Command as a flight engineer, and his
skipper, pilot Sandy Taylor from Inverurie, went out on his first
operation over Dresden with an experienced crew.
''It was just another mission as far as Bomber Command was
concerned,'' he recalls. ''A lot of the aftermath was politically
motivated. Harris took the blame, but the order came from chiefs of
staff, and Dresden must have been discussed by Churchill, Roosevelt and
Stalin at Yalta nine days before. It might have been an operation to
show Joe what Bomber Command was capable of doing. I don't think
Churchill had any love of Stalin.
''Bomber Command has nothing to feel ashamed about. You carried out
your orders or you were branded LMF (Lacking Moral Fibre), which was a
stigma you would carry for life. We were waging total war. There was no
longer such things as civilians or nice cities.''

FORMER Rangers and England footballer Mel Sterland appeared in court
in Sheffield yesterday, in connection with a #63,000 Post Office raid.
The 33-year-old ex-Ranger, who also played for Sheffield Wednesday and
Leeds, was accused of handling a safe and its contents stolen in the
raid.
Mr Sterland, of Carr Lane, Dronfield, near Sheffield, was remanded on
conditional bail for four weeks by the city's magistrates.
Following a burglary at Dore Post Office in Townhead Road, Sheffield,
when a safe containing cash, postal orders, and stamps was stolen,
detectives raided his #250,000 home on the edge of Derbyshire's Peak
District, and he was later arrested.
Mr Sterland -- now player manager of Boston United -- who moved to
Rangers for #800,000 in March 1989, appeared before magistrates charged
with handling stolen goods.
Mr Barry Murdoch, 19, of Hastilar Road South, Manor, and Mr Alan
Wilson, 24, of Fishponds Road West, Manor, both Sheffield, were charged
with burglary and theft of the safe.
Mr Sterland was granted bail on condition that he does not communicate
with any of his co-accused.

BEARSDEN will be bouncing for charity tomorrow night when a team of
teenagers take part in an all-night trampoline session in Westerton
Church Hall, Crarae Avenue, to raise around #500 for the Third World.
Starting at 9.30pm on Saturday until 9.30am on Sunday, 15 teenager
members of Revelation -- the Westerton Church Young People's group --
will trampoline in half-hour sessions all night. This is just one of
many novel projects organised on behalf of World Vision UK, a relief and
development agency, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year.
The main UK event this weekend is the 24 Hours Youth Famine -- an
organised fast which involves thousands of Scottish teenagers. Money
raised will help children in Rwanda, food aid and farming development in
Mozambique, and water and health programmes in Senegal. Last year the
event raised more than #1,480,000.
* Teenagers who want to join the fast can still do so. Ring the
hotline on 01908 841212 or 24 Hour Famine, World Vision, 599 Avenury
Boulevard, Milton Keynes, MK9 3PG.
Modern fling
* SO you think the Highlands are all Scottish country dancing and
ceilidhs? Wrong. Modern dance comes to Elgin next week with the start of
a seven-week series of workshops in contemporary dance styles. To book a
place contact the Moray Leisure Centre, Elgin, or ring 01343-550033.
Giveaway
* A RECURRING grievance among Scottish charities is that they rarely
benefit from UK fund-raising events. For instance when snooker champion
Stephen Hendry won the #300,000 Liverpool Victoria Charity Challenge,
the Down's Syndrome Association netted #100,000. But not a penny comes
to Scotland because the DSA operates only in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
Community
talk-in
* ACCORDING to futurologists like Alvin Toffler, we are all going to
become more involved in our local community in the future, partly
because of unemployment and the development of telecottages -- home
working on computer.
Whatever the reason, local communities are likely to become more, not
less, important in the twenty-first century. Therefore Who Speaks for
Communities?, the subject of a weekend residential school in Pitlochry
(April 18-20) is a well-timed event.
Organised by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations the aim
of the school will be to encourage a dialogue between community groups
and those interested in community development. For further information
ring Eileen Graham, SCVO, 031-556 3882.
Feminine sport
* MACHISMO turns off most women from taking part in sport. But there
is as positive side. Find out more at a one-day conference (to be
launched by Elaine C Smith) which is being organised by the Sports
Council for Glasgow and Women in Sport at Woodside Halls, Glasgow,
February 19. Further information on: 041-227 5933.
Pro-volunteers
* IF voluntary organisations are to compete in the market-place for
volunteers and resources, then they have to become more professional.
Volunteer Development Scotland is organising a series of two-day
courses on Promoting Your Organisation and Recruiting Volunteers. The
first starts on Wednesday, February 22 in Stirling. Cost #40 a day for
members. Further information from Volunteer Development Scotland, 80
Murray Place, Stirling. Phone 01786-479593.
Health and seek
* HOW do you find out about a local self-help group? The answer is,
with difficulty. You can short-circuit the foot-slogging by ringing
Health Search Scotland which provides information on self-help and
voluntary groups.
Set up by the Health Education Board for Scotland, the service is free
and all enquiries are treated in strict confidence. Ring: 0345-708010.
There is an answering machine service outside of normal office hours.
Oxfam chic
* ARMCHAIR shoppers will find plenty to interest them in Oxfam's new
1995 spring-summer catalogue, which offers a range of goodies from
around the world.
Today's Oxfam is chic, cheerful, and sophisticated. Here you will find
fashionable crochet waistcoats from Zimbabwe, colourful shawls from
Guatemala, children's clothes from El Salvador, along with Nepalese and
Indian picnic rugs. To get your catalogue ring 0869-245011.
Art school Turks
* MAKE a point next week of popping into Glasgow School of Art to see
the exhibition of Anatolian nomadic weavings in the Mackintosh Building.
Part of a collection built up by Maya Brisley, some bought directly from
tribes in Anatolia. The exhibition, which runs until March 3, also
includes tent hangings and nomadic jewellery, and various bags. Items
are for sale and prices start at a fairly modest #50.

TWENTY-four hours after describing train and bus users as ''dreadful
human beings'' Transport Minister Steven Norris found himself rubbing
shoulders with them yesterday.
After a day mostly spent insisting to the media that his remarks on
the attractiveness of the motor car were taken out of context, the
under-fire Minister found himself on a crowded InterCity from Stockport
to London -- and travelling second class, at that.
Earlier, the Prime Minister went to the defence of Mr Norris,
insisting in the Commons that his comments had been ''widely
misinterpreted''.
The day had started for the 49-year-old Minister -- a former car
salesmanwith a shuttle flight to Manchester for two engagements in
Oldham and Stockport.
The top-of-the-range chauffeured Vauxhall Omega V6 that had swept him
on his way from the airport was pounced on eagerly by photographers, as
if it proved a point.
Mr Norris insisted that letting the train take the strain on his
return journey had been organised nearly two weeks ago.
''I don't have to stage these things. I think that would be frankly
pathetic,'' he said.
The posse of photographers, with whom Mr Norris kept up a good-natured
banter, got off the train at Macclesfield, minutes down the line. Surely
now the Minister would move to the airy, uncrowded spaces of the first
class, lunch if required?
However, in second class he stayed, in his window seat, back to the
engine, working on his ministerial papers on a table shared with his
private secretary, a businessman and Great Ormond Street Hospital
haemotology consultant. Other passengers looked on in bewilderment.
The Minister methodically worked his way through his pile of papers --
a box and a half, he said later.
He paused briefly for a cup of coffee and a chocolate bar somewhere in
the Midlands and chatted occasionally with his fellow travellers.
''They are fine, delightful,'' said the Minister. ''I always make the
point that I am one of these passengers. On a journey like this it would
be crazy to use the car.''
And yes, he said, he had got a first-class ticket, but had not used
it.

THE Defence Secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, is expected to make a
statement in the Commons today after demanding the resignation of Air
Chief Marshal Sir Sandy Wilson in a face-to-face confrontation.
During the heated exchange in the Secretary of State's office on the
sixth floor of the Ministry of Defence, Mr Malcolm Rifkind made it clear
he had lost all confidence in the four-star officer, who has a salary of
#95,000.
The unprecedented move follows an independent investigation into the
expenditure of #387,000 on refurbishing Sir Sandy's official residence
at Hames Garth, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
A #100,000 report by Ms Sheila Master of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick
has concluded that no single person could be held responsible for the
expenditure, which included #60,000 on curtains, carpets, and interior
design.
However, there is criticism of Sir Sandy's lack of judgment and Mr
Rifkind is understood to have told him there was no longer confidence in
his abilities as a top-level budget holder, responsible for a
multi-million pound expenditure.
Sir Sandy was understood to have asked to see Mr Rifkind after details
of the report and accusations appeared in a national newspaper, after
what is believed to be a leak from high-level political sources.
Sir Sandy met Mr Rifkind at the MoD late yesterday afternoon.
The RAF is furious at Sir Sandy's treatment and senior officers have
pledged to support him, if attempts were made to make him a
''scapegoat''.
However Mr Rifkind's insistence that he no longer has confidence in
him makes his position untenable.
Sir Sandy is known to be angry that he has been unable to speak out
publicly on the issue.
He is believed to be keen for the Commons Defence Committee to hold an
inquiry into the affair.
Mr David Clark, the Shadow Defence Secretary, said: ''It's wrong to
make a scapegoat of Sandy Wilson.
''He may have made errors but the real responsibility lies with the
Secretary of State who has failed -- despite repeated warnings -- to
implement a proper financial control regime. We identified waste of over
#5000m in recent years.''

AN Englishman called English with a degree in English who wrote for a
job in Scotland has lost a racial discrimination claim -- that he was
turned down because he was English.
Yesterday, an industrial tribunal which heard 31-year-old Robert
English's case last month came out unanimously in favour of Alness
Citizens' Advice Bureau.
Middlesbrough-born Mr English said he was upset at the decision, but
intended to appeal.
He said the experience had not put him off living in the Highlands,
although he intended to stay in his present job in Wales.
Mr English had applied to the CAB for a welfare rights officer
vacancy.
He explained: ''I don't like England. It is too crowded. I like the
quality of life in Scotland.''
Mr English said he thought he had a good chance of landing the job
because of his qualifications and the low salary, which he thought would
deter others.
''I got my degree at Stirling University and fell in love with
Scotland. I was very keen to return.''
But as the date for interviews approached, Mr English had received no
contact from the CAB, so he phoned them.
He taped the conversation with CAB manager Alan Byron, who said: ''Oh
Bob, we thought you might not like it up here, only stay a little while,
and we would be faced with the bother of re-advertising and looking for
someone else.''
Mr English said he was annoyed at the ''absurd'' attitude, because he
was better qualified than other candidates.
Mr Byron denied that the CAB discriminated against Mr English. The job
was offered to a Glasgow man, but he turned it down, and it eventually
went to an Alness man.
In its findings, the tribunal said Mr English was one of 16 applicants
for the post. Ten of these, including Mr English, were not interviewed
for the job. Of the six who did get interviews two were English.
They said there was no difference in the arrangements which the CAB
made to decide which of the 16 should be offered employment.
However, the tribunal said some of Mr English's criticisms about the
CAB's procedures were well founded.
Mr Byron was not available for comment yesterday.

THREE Glasgow MPs have called for work on the controversial M77
extension to be halted to allow a reassessment of the environmental
impact of the road.
The Labour MPs, who represent constituencies directly affected by the
motorway extension, yesterday urged Strathclyde Regional Council and the
Scottish Office to instruct the contractors to halt the work.
They claimed that the environmental impact of the extension on local
communities had not been properly explored.
Mr Ian Davidson (Glasgow Govan), Mr Mike Watson (Glasgow Central) and
Mr Jimmy Dunnachie (Glasgow Pollok), made the call after the contractors
Wimpey had rejected a similar demand to delay construction work, until
the European Commission had considered a complaint that Strathclyde
region had failed to conduct an environmental impact assessment in
accordance with EU law.
Wimpey told the MPs that a written question on the matter had been
answered by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Roads Minister, in
the House of Commons on January 23 and said that any further questions
should be referred to the Scottish Secretary.
Speaking during a visit to part of the planned route in Corkerhill
yesterday, Mr Davidson conceded that Strathclyde region and the Scottish
Office might not be legally-bound to halt the work, because European
legislation came into effect after a public inquiry into the extension
in 1988.
However, he said he believed they were morally obliged to do so.
Mr Davidson denied that the MPs' move might embarrass the controlling
Labour group on Strathclyde region, which supported the M77 extension.
The MPs' call was welcomed by Corkerhill Community Council.
Its secretary, Councillor Walter Morrison, warned that fumes, from the
53,000 vehicles which would use the extension each day, would increase
the level of illness, in an area where the rate of respiratory illness
is 50% higher than the Glasgow average.
Councillor Charlie Gordon, chairman of the region's roads and
transportation committee, said later that work on the project would not
be halted.
He said a full environmental study, which exceeded all European and UK
standards, was carried out before the planning application was
submitted.

Britain later this year.
The makers of Interferon Beta, already in use in America, are hoping
to have approval from the European Licensing Authority in the summer.
Ironically, the Scots doctor whose pursuit of Interferon in the cause
of cancer victims led to his professional downfall may be among the
beneficiaries of the new treatment.
Dr Tom McAllister, the former consultant microbiologist at Yorkhill
Hospital in Glasgow -- who was struck off by the GMC three years ago for
diverting charity money to his Interferon Fund -- suffers from MS or
something akin to it.
''I will be watching developments with interest -- if it looks like
working out I will try it myself,'' he said yesterday. ''It would be
ironic -- I never dreamt when I started campaigning to make Interferon
available back in 1980 that I might be using it myself one day, but
things happen that way.''
British experts welcomed the development yesterday, but pointed out
that promising trial results on Interferon and another drug,
Copolymer-1, had to be treated with caution.
The trials show Interferon to work best on patients with relapsing and
remitting MS -- the most common form -- but its usefulness in patients
with chronic, progressive MS remains to be seen.
The Multiple Sclerosis Society also pointed out that, while no serious
side-effects of Interferon have emerged, the effects of long-term use
are an unknown quantity.
However, one of the biggest stumbling blocks could be the cost.
Schering Health Care denied reports that their drug could cost
#8000-#9000 per patient a year.
On that basis, according to a press release accompanying this week's
British Medical Journal, treating just half the 60,000 UK sufferers
would cost the NHS the equivalent of 0.7% of its annual budget. The
company could not say how much Interferon would cost.
In the USA, the cost is about #40 a vial, used once every two days, so
the annual cost there is nearly #6600 per patient.
Nevertheless, the possibility of the first effective drug for MS is
the news that sufferers like Mrs Moira Copeland, 44, from Balornock,
Glasgow, have been waiting for.
Mrs Copeland has fought against MS for 17 years, as she developed
failing eyesight, incontinence and weakened muscle. She fell and broke
her thigh last year and her leg had to be amputated. Yesterday she was
in Canniesburn Hospital for plastic surgery to the stump.
''Moira is a fighter -- she tells me she is looking forward to coming
home and getting stuck into the housework,'' said her husband, Robert,
45. ''The reality is she will need a wheelchair. They are going to give
her an artificial leg but it will be purely cosmetic -- her other leg is
too weak for her to start walking again.''
Mr Copeland, who gave up his job as a joiner eight years ago to nurse
his wife, said: ''Her eyes lit up last year when her neurologist told
her there was a new drug expected in 1995. It would be wonderful if
something could be done for people who are suffering like Moira.''
Dr McAllister was hopeful yesterday that the price of Interferon would
come down when it went into wide-scale distribution and the development
costs recouped, but Schering warned that it wasn't as simple as that.
''It is a very complex and expensive process, and that doesn't stop
once initial production is under way, and the drug also has to be kept
refrigerated all the time,'' said a spokesman.
Multiple sclerosis -- which is particularly prevalent in some parts of
North-east Scotland and the Northern Isles -- happens when a rogue
immune response strips the myelin sheath from the nerves; this results
in scarring and affects the nerve's ability to activate physical
functions.
According to an editorial in the BMJ, the trials so far show that
Interferon Beta-1B, the Schering product, produced a lower rate of
relapse than in patients taking a placebo.
However, this did not demonstrate an effect on disability, but another
test designed to show such an effect, using a rival product, showed a
delay in deterioration.
Professor Ian McDonald of the National Hospital for Neurology and
Neurosurgery in London said that the trials gave cause for optimism, but
caution was still necessary.
MS Society spokesman David Harrison said: ''We would not call this a
breakthrough in the headline sense, but it is encouraging. If it is
shown to work then our view is that any patient who could benefit should
receive it on an equitable basis, given the way NHS funding is allocated
-- whether you get the treatment or not should not depend on what part
of the country you happen to live in.''

THE average council house rent in Edinburgh is to rise from April, by
#1.85p a week, around 5%, the district council agreed yesterday.
The increase was voted through by the city's minority Labour
administration with SNP support, despite a Tory attempt to freeze the
#35.44p a week average bill. Edinburgh tenants already pay among the
highest charges in Scotland.
Councillor Mary Mulligan, Labour's housing convener, said more than
half the increase was due to interest charges on money borrowed to pay
for modernisation and repairs.
The council received no help with housing costs from the Government
and was not allowed to use council tax payments. These restrictions
meant all the housing services had to be paid for from rents, she said.
Councillor David Manson, the Tory spokesman, said that rents under
Labour had tripled in eight years.

THE Prime Minister's attempts to scare English electors away from
constitutional change by decrying regional assemblies as ''teenage
madness'' appears to have left them unruffled, according to an exclusive
poll by The Herald/System Three.
The poll of almost 1600 voters, in 145 constituencies south of the
Border, shows that the constitutional debate does not appear to have
reached critical mass there, and while there may be widespread apathy on
the notion of regional assemblies, there is no sign of fear of them.
There are also clear indications that very few English voters see the
issue as the kind of priority which would make them switch party. As a
result, it appears to be neither a vote-winner nor vote-loser. The poll
did not include Wales because nationalist support there would have
clouded the devolution issue.
The key question of how English electors would vote in a referendum on
devolution, involving setting up regional assemblies in England as well
as in Wales and Scotland, showed that even before a real debate has
started it could be a close contest.
There was a vote of 39% against such a UK-wide system, with 35% in
favour. Mr Major's onslaught may have stiffened resolve in his own party
in the South (Tory voters rejected the system by 60% to 24%), but he
appears to have failed to persuade Labour voters that Tony Blair's
proposals are a bad idea.
Labour voters in England support devolved British government by a
clear margin of 43% to 33%. Perhaps surprisingly, given the party's
federalist credentials, supporters of the Liberal Democrats backed the
scheme by just 38% to 37%.
The high overall number saying they did not know how they would vote,
25%, indicates that the argument could be there for the winning, if the
debate does take off.
Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, said of the results last night:
''This poll shows that most people in England who have thought about the
issue are against Labour's plans to break up Britain. They should think
again now.''
Mr Kim Howells, Labour's front-bench spokesman on the constitution,
said: ''To me this indicates that there is a desire throughout the
country for decentralised government, but it is clear people don't have
a clear picture in their minds yet of how this would work, so we have a
lot of explaining to do.
''The initial results are very encouraging from a Labour point of
view, given that we haven't really begun the argument yet. These figures
indicate that John Major has failed, except in the case of his party
diehards, to stir up fears about the supposedly dire consequences of our
policy.''
Another surprise in the poll for the Liberal Democrats was that their
supporters in their South-west heartland rejected the scheme. Mr Paul
Tyler, the MP for North Cornwall, said this was because support varied
across smaller areas than used in the survey.
He said that, in the past, big local authorities had been seen to take
power away from localities, rather than pull back power from Whitehall,
and there was clearly work to be done to win people over. ''I don't
think the debate has really got off the ground yet in England,'' he
said.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said the poll that showed there was no
hostility among the English electorate towards Scotland's national
aspirations and that John Major's attempt to stir up middle England
against Scotland was doomed.
He added: ''It also highlights the folly of Labour's approach in
mixing up the national case for a Scottish Parliament with the regional
case for English assemblies. There is clearly no groundswell of opinion
in favour of such an unnecessary fudge.''
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, said that there
were ''some comforting elements in the poll'', from the point of view of
Labour support. But he pointed out that the creation of the Scottish
Parliament and Welsh Assembly was not conditional on the setting up of
English regional assemblies, making the question an artificial one.
Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, a Social Security Minister in the Lords
and a former Scottish Minister, who is speaking on devolution in
Newcastle tonight, said of the poll: ''It shows that a majority of
people who have focused on the issue are against regional assemblies.
Many people regard Labour's plans as an irrelevance.''
* Apart from Lord MacKay's speech in Newcastle, Mr Allan Stewart, who
resigned as a Scottish Office Minister this week, is speaking tonight in
Tony Blair's Sedgefield constituency.
Our poll shows that the North-east of England is one of the areas
where support for devolution is strongest and understanding of the issue
is greatest. The Campaign for a Northern Assembly, which models itself
on its Scottish counterpart, has written to Mr Stewart to challenge his
opposition to devolution.

FORMER Hawick flanker Grant Harris, who was banned from rugby union
for life after having signed professional forms with the Carlisle rugby
league side, is seeking reinstatement to the amateur ranks.
The 27-year-old joined the Guildford Park club in January, 1992, after
having been dropped from by Hawick. He maintains that he received only
travelling expenses and a meal allowance during his two years with
Carlisle, and that he had never been paid a wage or playing bonuses.
Harris now is a fireman in Hawick and is desperate to re-enlist with
his old junior club, Hawick YM. His case now is before the Scottish
Rugby Union and is due to be discussed at the general committee meeting
today.
''I just want to play social rugby,'' he said. ''I have written to SRU
chief executive Bill Hogg and have been interviewed by the South of
Scotland SRU representatives, Bert Duffy and Derek Brown. I got a fair
hearing, but the matter has to go to the International Board.''
Harris was one of three Hawick players recruited by Carlisle at the
beginning of 1992. Colin Paxton, a cousin of injured Scotland scrum half
Gary Armstrong, and Derek Armstrong also made the leap across the great
divide which still separates the two rugby codes.
''I was approached by Carlisle and played a trial game for them. It
was Colin Paxton's first game and the TV cameras were there. I scored
four tries and a couple of them were shown on Border TV.
''I got a letter from the SRU banning me for a year. I thought well,
I've been banned for a year, what can I do? I reckoned the best thing to
do was sign for Carlisle. Then I got the letter banning me for life,''
Harris said.
The player, who made six first-team appearances on the wing for the
English side, before playing for their Alliance side, suffered a severe
ankle injury 12 months ago and had not played since.
''I didn't earn a thing during my time at Carlisle,'' he claimed. ''In
fact, it cost me money. I ruined my car travelling up and down from
Hawick. I sent off statements of accounts to the SRU showing that I
hadn't made any money. So, even though I signed professional forms, I
don't consider myself to have been a professional in the sense that I
never earned a penny from the game.''
Reinstatement to the amateur ranks can only be sanctioned by the
International Board, which would be guided by the recommendation of the
home union.
The outcome of the Harris case will depend upon his assertion that he
made no money from his time with Carlisle.
Yesterday, SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said: ''Derek Brown and Bert
Duffy will submit a report to the committee meeting tomorrow. Depending
on the outcome of that report, we will then make a recommendation to the
International Board, to be discussed at their annual general meeting
next month.''

Your report on future mental health services for south Glasgow
(February 2) draws some premature conclusions. The trust has, over
recent months, been discussing internally the development of proposals
for future mental health services in the south of the city. These
discussions are very much at a preliminary stage, although there is a
strong aspiration to develop a model of care for south Glasgow based on
the development of an extensive community infrastructure and the
development of in-patient services for the south-east of Glasgow in that
part of the city. This model would be similar in design to that which is
very successfully being put in place currently in the east and north of
the city.
The proposals which are beginning to emerge internally within the
trust are consistent with Greater Glasgow Health Board's published
mental health strategy. The reason detailed proposals for the south of
Glasgow do not form part of the recently published Greater Glasgow Joint
Community Care Plan is that detailed proposals have not yet been
formulated.
The Joint Community Care Plan does, however, clearly state that:
''Development of a strategy for the south and west of Glasgow is
currently being discussed, and this will provide the basis for a
programme of hospital reduction and investment in new health and social
care community services.''
As my reported letter to the health board clearly indicated, the trust
has an absolute commitment to bring forward clearly developed proposals
for south Glasgow for discussion with our partners in the joint planning
process. We have always assumed that firm proposals would also require
full public consultation. In the light of this, the article in The
Herald is entirely speculative. The trust will bring forward proposals
which will include consideration of the future of the Leverndale site,
given that the larger part of the site is already empty and subject to
increasing vandalism and cost. A full debate of the issues would be more
appropriate when firm proposals have been agreed and published for
public consultation.

I have followed with interest the correspondence in these columns
about the Clyde Festival Gardens project. I have found myself strongly
attracted to the concept of an exciting, imaginative project on this
unique site.
Critics of the proposal have argued that the festival gardens project
is not financially viable without substantial public funds. I
understand, however, that Glasgow Chamber of Commerce does believe that
such a scheme could be viable. Moreover, the promoters' financial and
property advisers attest to its viability, their track record including
schemes such as Princes Square, Parkhead Forge, and other ambitious
projects which critics said could never be economically viable.
I have no doubt that Glasgow's commercial future requires appropriate
business park space, but I would have to question whether it is sensible
to locate such accommodation on a site which might otherwise be used as
a major tourist attraction to Glasgow. Amid all the claim and
counterclaim, I have not been able to ascertain whether all the
possibilities for the site have been fully investigated. Glasgow has
suffered enough missed opportunities without adding to the list.
This is not, and must not be, a partisan issue. It should appeal to
all those who feel that Glasgow's great maritime shipbuilding heritage
should be given proper recognition and at the same time form part of a
permanent public entertainment space like the garden festival. If I
understand the festival gardens project properly, it would give Glasgow
an outstanding tourist attraction that is vitally needed if future
generations of tourist are to be attracted to our great city.
In that spirit, and as a token of support, I am responding to Mr
Geoffrey Jarvis's letter by contributing that symbolic #1 to help
finance the planning application which is being made for the Clyde
Festival Gardens project.

A fortnight or so ago I wrote to the Labour Shadow Defence Secretary,
Dr David Clark.
This followed the deluge of devolution details given by Labour. But,
as defence was not featured, I was querying that party's stance on the
Scottish infantry regiments.
The two other opposition parties, particularly the SNP, had stated
their intention to re-form the amalgamated regiments (The Queen's Own
Highlanders and the Gordon Highlanders) as individual regiments should
the opportunity arise. Only the Labour Party had not declared its
position on that issue. That it is an important matter -- and one
affecting votes -- cannot be questioned. A series of polls carried out
from Galashiels to Inverness, involving more than 30,000 persons at
random (of all parties) gave consistent returns of 97% support for the
retention of the individual Scottish regiments.
Although I have yet to receive an answer or acknowledgement from Dr
Clark to my letter of January 14, an item on the Grampian TV lunchtime
newscast on January 23 may be connected.
It was reported that John Home Robertson, a long-standing member of
the cross-party Defence Select Committee, had challenged Alex Salmond to
state how he would fulfil his pledge to re-form the Gordon Highlanders.
(I would imagine with rather less difficulty than renationalising a
privatised industry, or the reverse.)

Your report on the ''truancy tables'' and the reaction of the teaching
unions was sadly predictable as well as being ambivalent in attitude
towards the messages and the lessons to be learned from the information
(January 31).
Children who do attend school, their parents and teachers whose
efforts are consistently and insolently rejected by persistent truants
must have been dismayed by your caution that the facts of themselves
cannot be relied on in judgment of the situation, but I cannot imagine
that parents of children at schools either at the top or the bottom of
this ''league table for truancy'' would share that view.
Those who regularly truant often as a demonstration of their ability
to abuse and challenge the system, do so with impunity and their
confidence is boosted by the certainty of there being no effective
sanction. Furthermore the signals sent out by journalists and by the
trendies in the teaching unions provide them with a cover from the
treatment which they really deserve.
Habitual truants include in their numbers a hard core of pupils whose
attitudes must be challenged and effectively dealt with outwith the
school system and the media and the teaching unions should support the
rights of teachers and parents, not forgetting conforming school
children, who do make an effort (notwithstanding personal and family
difficulties at times) who are crying out for support on the matter of
discipline, who need support when children are being bullied by the neds
who walk all over the education system at the present time.
Teachers are not trained social workers and although there are many
with experience (who may, for example, also be parents) and who do a
remarkably good job at ''fire-fighting'' the worst problems, they are
with few exceptions ill-equipped to achieve solutions within the school
environment. Those who make life miserable for others and soak up the
valuable efforts of teachers, which would be better expended on those
children who genuinely wish to learn, should be rooted out of the
general education system and dealt with by more special education units
and by social workers.
Teachers in the Lothians have to work under a non-exclusion policy
(except in the most serious circumstances) which determines that ''all
pupils are entitled to a mainstream education'' and this is clearly
intended to include the minority who hold the system in such contempt.
This is a slap in the face for those children and parents who conform
and to teachers who are battling to cope with disinterested, abusive
children.
All my teacher relations and friends -- ranging from the headmaster to
nursery schools teacher -- agree with the contrary view that the
majority of children are entitled to the best education a teacher can
deliver, in circumstances where this is not deliberately threatened and
disrupted by the minority.
The situation in our classrooms today is a classic example of the
tyranny of a minority view which the education establishment in Scotland
is either unable or unwilling to challenge.
We must turn back the tide of hypocrisy, frustration, and despair
which threatens to engulf the teaching profession today.

The item on Tomintoul Enterprises Ltd (January 25) must surely raise
the question of the level in remuneration about to be distributed to the
receiver (#275,000 of #325,000 or 84%). At the same time the creditors
will receive an initial 20%.
Why in light of the amount of legal and accountancy effort this case
has attracted and no doubt paid for, was a precedent not set which would
have given the creditors and the receiver a similar initial dividend,
and comparable shares in the new enterprise -- almost a ''No win, No
fee'' basis?

Heartiest congratulations to the Royal SNO for honouring all serious
music lovers with their performance of Alfred Schnittke's Faust Contata.
While all UK orchestras are fighting for survival the bravery of the
Royal SNO to present a masterwork by a master composer, notwithstanding
the possibility of financial disaster, should qualify for the St Mungo
Prize.
Hats off to Paul Hughes together with his chairman, Morrison Dunbar,
for such an audacious undertaking, and if there is any justice in the
hard and cold world of today the Royal SNO will and should be
recompensated by larger and more committed audiences.  Shelley's
apposite phrase, ''Rarely, rarely comest thou Spirit of Delight'', has
rarely, in my opinion, been more exemplified. Viva Royal SNO.

I have never been a nationalist, Scottish or otherwise, but I must
admit that for some time I have felt a growing unease.
Is it only my imagination or is there a degree of asset stripping
going on involving the Government and Scotland?  Are we intended to prop
up other parts of the UK by the transference of jobs and industries?  I
am afraid that I find it hard to believe the reassurances of the
Scottish Office and the Government about how well we are doing. In fact,
the more they reassure me the more I worry.
Perhaps the time has come for a Scottish assembly, if only to provide
some economic protection to Scotland and its nationals.

THE jury at the Bonnyrigg bank robbery murder trial had a moment of
light relief as they watched a video recording.
It showed the scene as the alleged robbers burst into the bank. ''Get
down,'' they allegedly shouted to the bank staff and customers. There
was no reaction, allegedly, apart from the collie dog belonging to a
customer, which immediately lay flat on the floor.
Keep it secret
A FUNNY old place the BBC. Here they are devoting a whole day's
viewing to Comic Relief red nose day, the whole point of which is to
relieve us chaps of money to help Africa.
Then we hear of a memo sent out by one Nicholas Moss, head of policy
management at televison centre in London. ''In any coverage of Comic
Relief could you please arrange for your producers to ensure they
exercise the greatest care of references to where poeple can buy red
noses. Ideally, none should be named . . .''
The memo goes into some detail, with which we shall not trouble you,
about how the outlets might be mentioned but ends: ''As you know, the
presumption is against mentioning any of them.''
PS -- If you want to buy a red nose you can get one at Burger King,
Oxfam, Save the Children, Shell garages, or W H Smith. But don't tell
the BBC we told you.
The last word
MAURICE Lindsay, the intellectual and sage, has written his last
poems. Oh no, some might say. Thank the Lord, others might say.
Whatever your view, the works should be worth reading, if you believe
the publisher's blurb (as we always do at the Diary). Speaking of the
book News of the World: Last Poems, the Scottish Cultural Press says:
''This last collection shows Maurice Lindsay writing at the height of
his powers and achieving moments of almost mystic perfection . . . The
poet considers his own advancing years and the approach of the ultimate
experience -- death. But through the creative paradox of his art, the
combination of humility and boldness of spirit with which he speaks of
final things, Lindsay transforms the poems of mortality into triumphant
affirmations.''
Sounds great, but what is Mr Lindsay going to do, Sinatra-style, for a
follow-up?
Seeing is believing
THE John Menzies shop at Glasgow airport is selling copies of Tony
Blair: The Moderniser. Hold the front page, we hear you say. But we want
to tell you they have decided, for some reason, to put the book about
the boy leader of the Labour Party under the heading ''Latest Fiction''.
Life's a drag
IT is a familiar daily scene at a factory in the Kingsway industrial
estate in Dundee. A line of forlorn, huddled figures outside a factory
gate. The occasional passing driver toots his horn expressing solidarity
for the locked-out workers in what is obviously another strike to blight
the already scarred industrial face of Clootie City.
Except in this case it isn't. The location is the main printing plant
of D C Thomson, so it definitely ain't industrial action. Simply that
the publishers of the Sunday Post and sundry other weel-kent newspapers
have banned smoking not only in their buildings but also anywhere within
the perimeter.
Och, it's a hard life for the smoker these days.
Clean sheet
INTERESTING place the island of Bute but we had never hitherto
associated it with offshore finance. We are talking here about a
submission to the island's licensing court, as reported in that sturdy
publication The Buteman.
It reads: ''In making a plea for renewal of a provisional licence
granted to Mr Ian McCulloch for an ambitious development of Square One
in Gallowgate, solicitor Elaine Campbell explained that the search for
the shortfall in the verbally promised support had turned abroad. New
legislation to prevent money laundering had, however, held up the
transfer of a block of money from sources in Italy, Spain, and Malta.''
In the dark
NEWS from New Zealand (and keep your oxymorons to yourself): Prime
Minister Jim Bolger has initiated plans to abolish the imperial honours
system in the rump of the globe and replace it with awards more in
keeping with the modern world -- Companion of the Grand Kiwi Fruit,
Order of the Noble Lamp Chop, and suchlike.
Obviously enough, this attempt to follow Australia's lead hasn't gone
down too well with remaining empire loyalists, hence the claim down
under that the knights are fair drawing in.
No place like home
THE Scottish Office is pleased to announce (and we know because
they've announced it) that ''The number of people receiving a home help
service increased by 46% between 1980 and 1992. Over the same period the
number of home helps rose by 9% . . .''
This is, of course, wonderful news, but how was it achieved? Simple:
there was ''an increase in the average number of clients per home help
from six in 1980 to eight in 1992.'' Our sums make that a 33% increase
in productivity, yet there's no mention of the number of home helps now
in desperate need of home helps.

THIS week, according to the London Times, was the Week of Insolence.
Well, certainly in the House. Ann Widdicombe, an Unemployment -- pardon,
an Employment --Minister told Labour's ex-actress MP, Glenda Jackson,
that she was certain Ms Jackson had never got a job on the basis of her
looks. Steve Norris, the Transport Minister, was devoutly suspicious of
public transport on the basis that the bus-people were ''dreadful human
beings''. I don't myself use public transport either, on the basis that
the public do, but on the other hand I don't stand for public election
either.
Later of course, the Prime Minister described Tony Blair as a
''dimwit''. Blair may well be but it hardly does to call anybody a
dimwit in an accent such as John Major's. If Mrs Thatcher had need --
and she did -- to modify her accent and her tone of voice, then Major
has more of a necessity. He sounds for all the world like Peter Cook
taking the piss out of the inhabitants of Croydon. It is all very well
being from the people. It is quite another sounding like the Mr Pooter
with only a half pint of mild in him. Later a Labour MP said a Tory one
was a ''nitwit''. So are they all honorouble men. So are they all
dimwits and nitwits. But as insolence it hardly shapes up.
As insolence few can manage in today's House of Commons some of the
splendid remarks of the past. Hore-Belisha, a major figure in the Labour
governments and inventor of the Belisha Beacon, was once informed that
when he was circumcised ''they threw the wrong bit away''. Now there's
an insult. And perhaps the last great insult was Denis Healey's line on
Sir Geoffrey Howe: ''Being criticised by Howe is like being savaged by a
dead sheep''. Denis had real ability at insults, but he was hardly
subtle.
I always rather liked Alec Douglas-Home's riposte to Harold Wilson,
who had been going on for hours about how the Scottish aristo was the
14th Earl of Home. ''Come to think of it'', replied the good lord, ''I
suppose the leader of the Opposition is the 14th Mr Wilson''. And
Winston Churchill's insults remain legendary. To Lady Astor who had
blithely informed him that if he was her husband she'd poison him,
Churchill replied at once. ''Madam,'' he said, if I were your husband .
. .'' he paused, ''I'd drink it''.
But MPs are children in comparison to children. Weans can be a touch
direct though. I ever cherish the remark made to myself and a
supplementary teacher back in the days when I was in the schoolroom,
teaching the little boys and girls art and despair. A small girl with
hair the colour of a sunny cornfield and an expression of such beatific
innocence she would have passed for a Victorian scrap of an angel, once
told me that: ''As youse are that baldy, Sur, can youse no get a wig
like what Mrs Campbell huz?'' Mrs Campbell sported a wig which was so
obvious that she appeared to be wearing her breakfast on her head and
many years had been spent in cultivating an ignorance of this fact in
every staffroom.
The child's name was, I remember, Davina. And there was, believe me,
absolutely no question, that she was most purposeful in this appalling
insult to a very sensitive lady who had been thinning for over a decade.
There was only one response to this. ''Davina,'' I said, ''away you go
and attend to your work. At least Mrs Campbell can read and write''.
This went down equally badly with the both of them.
I remember as a child myself getting into a wee bit of soapy with a
teacher when he asked me how I had managed to do so well in my exams in
everything but maths and science. ''So you're not as glaiket as you make
out?'' I asked him who had told him that I had been first in English and
Latin and art and history. He told me that a wee bird had informed him.
I knew it had to be my rather portly register teacher. ''Was it a wee
fat bird?'' I enquired. It was followed by a long thin strap I
recollect.
But what adults always seemed to have up their sleeve was what they
described as ''Dumb Insolence''. Now this was ever somewhat of a poser
for the child accused of it. It often went along the lines of the query:
''Can you give me any reason why you should not be thrashed to the
condition of a quivering jelly'' or words along those lines. Well you
wanted to reply: ''Yes, Dr Goebbels, I can think of every reason in the
world, including the notion that you yourself should be taken to a
public place and thereby hanged till you are dead, and maybe worse'',
you wanted to return.
Instead you learned to mutter a low, and frightened ''No, Sir'',
because if you didn't say anything the belting was for dumb insolence
rather than anything you had actually committed. Adults in the 1950s
seemed to have obtained their role models from Mr Murdstone, for
heaven's sake.
But we live in a less robust age and children can now insult adults at
will and get away with it. The story of the august archbishop who went
round a school in some diocese in England recently comes to mind and a
child of perhaps 11 told the good man to ''eff off''. The arch drew
himself up and addressed the boy. He told him of his many long years at
the seminary, of his long years as a missionary, of his work at
university and college, of his lonely and hard-working decade out in
East Africa, of his degrees and of his good works. ''And after all
that'', said the cleric, ''you speak to me like that, a mere child. You
eff off''. But MPs are sensitive souls. Mind you, try insulting a
journalist. Don't.

THE evidence of the second System Three poll into support for
devolution, in this case in England, shows a general lack of interest in
the matter. Whatever the merits of Labour's proposals for a string of
regional assemblies south of the Border, nobody is clamouring for them
at the moment. That may mean that the matter has not sufficiently been
aired in England. It will, however, have to be aired in a General
Election and not least because the proposals for significant
constitutional change in Scotland are bound to impact on English
opinion. The state of play at the moment is that there is no marked
English hostility to change north of the Border, although there is a
slight but potentially significant cost to Labour. The response to the
Labour proposals for UK-wide constitutional change was to produce a net
loss of support for Labour of 1%. That may seem little but only if
Labour's huge lead in recent opinion polls is maintained. It may not be,
for students of voting behaviour have long identified a tendency of
opinion to harden in its old mould as a General Election's polling day
approaches.
The poll shows that whereas most Scots identify with Scotland rather
than Britain in establishing their identity, English respondents were
more evenly divided. Even there a slight majority (51%) accepted a
British rather than English identity. It may be that for English people
the terms British and English are in effect interchangeable (though some
English nationalists, like the late A J P Taylor, insisted that the
effect of the Union was to denationalise the English). The significance
of this difference, whatever its explanation, is enormous since it
confirms the underlying sentiment which sustains Scots hope for
constitutional change. No equal force even begins to emerge as
supporting regional assemblies. The only potential force of equal power
to Scottish feeling would be a coherent English national sentiment, but
none of the main political parties wishes to provoke such a reaction.
None, however, seems to have even considered how it might impose itself
on them, and how the Unionists, who dominate the three UK parties, would
be able to contain it were it to threaten to do so.
The poll, however, suggests that ''Wayward sisters, depart in peace''
would characterise English reactions to Home Rule for Scotland (and
might even extend to complete separation, if support for that
development went on growing). Would that benign mood survive Mr Blair's
pledge, assuming a Labour victory in 1996 or 1997, to pass the necessary
legislation in the first year of a new Parliament? It would not be an
easy passage since it would be opposed tooth and nail by an unrepentant
Opposition. It would be complicated legislation at the best of times
(who, for example, would pay any extra taxes a Scottish assembly might
impose?) and Mr Blair will have plenty of other matters on his plate.
Will he be able to command popular Scottish patience and understanding
if his timetable slips? (It seems unlikely that he will enjoy the
confidence of the Scottish Nationalists, whose future clout is, however,
unpredictable.) No great constitutional change in British history has
passed easily, and re-establishing a Scottish parliament in whatever
form will be no exception.

EDINBURGH Ladies have lived in the shadow of Western Klick Photopoint
for the best part of two decades but tomorrow, at the McTaggart Sports
Centre in Dundee, they could emulate the Glasgow side by completing the
indoor hockey league and cup double.
The cup already is in their possession and only Hyndland and
Menzieshill stand between them and a third successive league title.
Jill Messenger, the backbone of the Edinburgh side, reflected the
confidence of her colleagues when she said: ''No disrespect to our
opponents, but if we play to form then we shouldn't have too much
difficulty in getting the points.''
* MENZIESHILL striker John Christie yesterday flew out to New York to
guest for the New Jersey side, Bada, at this weekend's holiday
tournament in Toronto. With the indoor league and cup double secured for
the third time in five years, the Menzieshill captain should have been
on cloud nine as he set out but this was not the case.
Before he left he took the opportunity to have a swipe at the
competitions committee for rescheduling postponed outdoor league matches
for the weekend of February 17 to 19, in direct opposition to the
MIM-hosted European indoor club championship at Meadowbank.
Christie, reflecting the views of many enthusiasts, said: ''This is
the first time the championship has come to Britain and the players are
not being allowed to watch it. It's ridiculous.''
Moves are afoot to rectify the situation but the intervention may have
come too late although two of the games, involving neighbouring clubs,
could be played later in the season.

There were no real surprises in the public sector pay awards announced
yesterday, although doctors must feel that their harrying campaign of
recent months has brought modest dividends. Nevertheless, for most
public sector workers involved the settlement was close enough to their
worst expectations to rekindle considerable anger. The Government is
committed to close adherence to the pay policy for workers in this
sector which insists that all pay increases have to be met fully from
existing budgets. The strain which this imposes on those bodies like
local authorities and health boards which have to find the money for the
increases is considerable. Having laid down the economic parameters the
Government must now pay attention to the political implications of their
policies. These are likely to be difficult.
The obvious path for the Government to follow is to try to imply that
it has little responsibility for hardships, redundancies, and (in
England) the increased school class sizes which will be the inevitable
result. It's not our fault, runs the Government refrain. Local
authorities always seem to find money from somewhere, the apologists
will say. This is the purest nonsense; nor will it work any more. There
is a public appreciation of the fact that local authorities do not have
the central funding they once enjoyed. Just as clearly, there is no
doubt that it is the reduction of central government funding which has
allowed the present situation to develop. The Government can cast
blameless eyes to heaven and protest innocence until it is breathless,
but it will find the task of targeting local authorities in the next few
months as the culprits in the inevitable round of cuts and squeezes to
be quite impossible, and rightly so.
It is a sad reflection of Government policies that public sector
workers, who seek to deliver services which any society worthy of the
name requires to be done by public servants, have been penalised because
of political ideology. Running down state services is just part of the
assault on the public sector which is based in the belief that
Government has no part to play in the delivery of services to a
tax-paying society. Those who ask what Government's precise role is
supposed to be have thus far only had answers in the negative. It is
this nihilism, by which we mean extreme scepticism, which has brought
Britain to a position of considerable confusion as to what constitutes
society and how, or if, it is to develop. Aside from these grand
questions, but intimately connected, the public sector workers find
their pay and conditions squeezed and discover that according to
Government statistics their pay rates are ahead of the private sector.
As our investigation into pay on the page opposite shows, this is at
best misguided and at worst a deliberate misrepresentation. The heat and
anger of yesterday's pay awards will dissipate slowly but the
consequences will remain.

WILLIE Miller, sacked as manager of Aberdeen earlier this week,
yesterday revealed that he can still help the Dons in their bid to
compete with the Old Firm -- by becoming a shareholder when the club
goes public in the summer.
Miller, who spent 24 years as a player then manager at Pittodrie, said
yesterday that there was no feeling of bitterness from him over recent
events, and club chairman Ian Donald, the man who had to announce what
was an unpopular decision with the fans, did not rule out the
possibility of Miller returning as a director.
Miller, who could do nothing to halt Aberdeen's bad run which has seen
them slump to second bottom in the premier division -- they are just two
points ahead of bottom club Partick Thistle who have a game in hand --
backed the Pittodrie club's decision to go public and said: ''I will be
first in the queue to buy shares to help the club raise the money they
need to compete with Rangers and Celtic.
''I feel no bitterness towards Aberdeen and I would still do anything
to help them become the top team in the country again.
''During my 24 years at Pittodrie, I built up a strong feeling for the
Dons, probably a lot stronger than some of the supporters.
''Selling shares is something that the club should proceed with and
something I proposed when I was manager. It is for the long-term benefit
of the club and gives the fans the chance to become more involved.''
Said Donald: ''We will talk to Willie if he ever wants a place on the
board.''
Donald expects a demonstration against him during the match against
Rangers at Pittodrie on Sunday by fans angry at the sacking of Miller.
Meanwhile, Roy Aitken, the man charged with restoring Aberdeen's
fortunes, will get on with the job in the same professional manner he
showed as a player.
At the height of his playing days with Celtic, the big fellow always
led the charge, often to the wrath of opposing fans, including those of
Aberdeen. But Aitken knows he faces a huge task in steering the
Pittodrie side to premier division safety.
He has taken on the job knowing that his appointment is not a popular
one with everyone in the north-east. But, despite that disadvantage, the
former Scotland internationalist is determined that by the end of the
season his title of caretaker manager will be reduced to manager.
''I know I am not the man the supporters want for the job,'' he said.
''My appointment is not going to please everyone, but that does not
worry me. They appreciate I' committed to the club and will give it my
best shot.
''A lot of fans resented me when I first came here, but I never had
any doubts about joining Aberdeen and would not have if I had. Nor would
I have accepted this challenge if I had any doubts now. Hopefully, I
have earned the respect of our support and intend earning more by the
end of the season.''
One of Aitken's first moves has been to put back contract talks with
five of his squad, rightly believing that getting points for the club is
a much higher priority than individual deals.
As a result, Duncan Shearer, Scott Booth, Stephen Wright, Paul Kane,
and Brian Irvine will have to wait to discuss their futures.
Said Aitken: ''The club must come first and the players understand
this. Hopefully, new deals will be tied up in the weeks ahead, but the
immediate priority is to get the club out of its present position.''
Against Rangers, Aberdeen will again be without injured pair Eoin Jess
and Ray McKinnon, but midfielder Peter Hetherston is fit.

PERIMETER fences could go back up inside English grounds unless clubs
are successful in putting down a new outbreak of hooliganism.
The possibility of a return to barriers has been raised by Chelsea in
the aftermath of ugly crowd disturbances at the end of their FA Cup tie
against Millwall on Wednesday night, when 38 people were arrested, 19
fans charged, and 11 policemen injured.
It was suspected that the tie, decided in Millwall's favour after a
penalty shoot-out, might be used as an opportunity for some
troublemakers, who masquerade as supporters, to make their presence felt
again after a spell during which football was relatively free of
hooliganism.
The meeting of the London clubs and their supporters, who have a
notorious rivalry, was always going to be a tense affair, and even
though there was a massive police presence, it proved impossible to
prevent an outbreak of fighting.
Chelsea, who reached the FA Cup final last season, now face
repercussions from the authorities.
But no-one should gloat, because trouble can flare at any ground. Even
in Scotland, where the game has been free of violence within stadiums,
there is a need for constant vigilance, as the incident involving Davie
Cooper at Tynecastle on Tuesday proved.
A supporter spat on Cooper as he and his Clydebank team-mates were
leaving the pitch at the end of the Scottish Cup, third-round replay
against Hearts. The former Rangers winger reported the incident to the
police, but the culprit had run off, and Lothian and Borders Police last
night confirmed they were taking the matter seriously.
John Borthwick, secretary of the Federation of Hearts Supporters'
Clubs, called on fans to point out offenders, and his attitude is
exactly the response Chelsea's chairman, Ken Bates, is seeking from his
club's supporters. Bates, of course, is the man who once considered
electrifying fences at the West London ground, but later dropped the
idea, although now he wants to introduce a ''vigilante'' scheme.
Writing in the programme for the Millwall match, he said: ''Bad
behaviour is a curse. Stewards are paid to stop this, but if they do
nothing, tell us. Better still, since the good guys greatly outnumber
the bad, have your own neighbourhood watch operation.''
Scottish supporters could also point out offenders and make it easier
for the police and stewards to remove them, but putting fences back up
would be an admission that all the hard work and money spent on policing
Scottish football was in vain.
Also, as the discussion south of the Border takes in the possible
re-erection of fences, it would be wise to pause and consider why they
were done away with in the first place.
They were dragged down after the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989, when
fans were crushed to death because they could not spill on to the
trackside after a surge behind them.
A perimeter fence would have prevented Manchester United's Eric
Cantona from what seemed to be an attack on a supporter 15 days ago.
But that is no argument for putting the barriers up and making fans
feel as though they are caged in. English football will consider going
back to the bad old days, but the game in the south should resist and
find another way.
Nevertheless, Chelsea's managing director, Colin Hutchinson, issued a
statement. ''Football spectators, by consistent good behaviour, had
perimeter fences removed. Sadly, there is a danger of the actions of a
few bringing them back.''
The Football Association reacted coolly to that, with spokesman Colin
Davies pointing out: ''We have to look at all the possibilities, but if
you believe what happened at Chelsea to be an isolated incident, the
balance of probability would be against a return to fences.''
However, the FA, who are sure to hold an inquiry into the shocking
events at Stamford Bridge, welcomed Chelsea's decision to launch their
own investigation to identify troublemakers on video and ban them from
the ground.
Commander Anthony Rowe of Scotland Yard said: ''We cannot prevent
pitch invasions but we are largely successful in keeping rival fans
apart.''
A spectator attack on a referee at Blackburn, the Cantona incident,
and crowd problems at both Chelsea-Millwall FA Cup meetings have brought
hooliganism sharply back into the public eye. ''We have made great
strides in dealing with hooligans in recent years and I hope we are not
going back to the days when they seemed to dominate the game,'' said FA
Chief Executive Graham Kelly.
A 400-strong police contingent and hundreds of stewards formed what
was believed to be the biggest security operation at a London match in
recent times. Chelsea's security precautions seemed thorough too, but a
few hot-heads slipped through the net, and now Chelsea face a fine and
the possibility of being ordered to play behind closed doors.
That would mean an alarming loss of finance and Chelsea are bound to
resist any such move, but those who remember the faces of fans trapped
behind fences at Hillsborough would prefer that as alternative.
* MORTON manager Allan McGraw yesterday called for the SFA to look
again at the Scottish Cup replay rule, because he is unhappy that clubs
should be forced into playing two ties in midweek.
McGraw believes that this could influence the promotion and relegation
issues.
This week Meadowbank Thistle and Berwick Rangers were involved in a
cup-tie on Monday and then replayed, with extra time, on Tuesday. Now
they each will meet promotion hopefuls Dumbarton and Clyde tomorrow in
the the league.
McGraw said: ''I do not think it is correct that this should happen.
The days of cup-ties being replayed time after time are gone because of
the penalty shoot-out.
''Now, however, we have these clubs, whose players must have been
stretched this week, going into games on Saturday which can influence
the outcome of the league season. I am unhappy about that for we are one
of the clubs desperately trying for promotion.''
* CHELSEA striker Robert Fleck is to spend a second month on loan to
Bristol City after making four appearances in his first spell.
* THE Scottish League have arranged a programme for next Tuesday
night. The matches are:
Premier division -- Partick Thistle v Dundee United. First division --
Airdrie v Clydebank. Third division -- Caledonian Thistle v Montrose,
East Stirling v Albion Rovers.

MASSIVE world tours by rock groups Dire Straits and Genesis helped to
push the overseas earnings of the British music industry beyond #1bn in
1993, according to a major report published yesterday.
A survey by British Invisibles, the private sector export promotions
organisation, suggests that Britain is a leading world centre for music
publishing and that the music business as a whole makes a very
significant contribution to the nation's economy. Its annual income is
now comparable to that of the UK steel industry.
More importantly, the survey shows that British music's exports --
#1,158m -- were virtually double the value of its imports. Only a
handful of niche industries with exports above #1bn can match this
performance.
While some of the earnings came from visible exports like CDs,
records, musical instruments and sheet music, the bulk (69%) came from
invisibles. These were mostly through record company royalties and
performance fees.
A breakdown of the figures shows that recording (Britain has 200
recording studios) was the industry's biggest moneyspinner with gross
overseas earnings of #368m. Music publishing came second with #248m,
while live performances abroad scored a remarkable #100m.
Among the top groups and artists who embarked on world tours in 1993
were Dire Straits (who earned #16.84m) and Genesis (#17.27m). The live
performance figure is expected to be even higher in 1994 on the back of
international tours by acts like Pink Floyd, Phil Collins, and the
Rolling Stones.
The music industry's performance bears favourable comparison with that
of the British film and television industries. While both film and TV
enjoy substantially high gross invisible earnings from overseas sales
and inward investment, their net position is less attractive. Television
has a net deficit of #115m on overseas trade while film generates a
surplus of only #208m.
The report, which also takes account of classical music's
contribution, concludes: ''The strength of the UK music industry
internationally rests on the creative talent of British composers,
performers, and lyricists allied to the business skills of music
companies and entrepreneurs.''
Indications suggest that 1994 will prove to have been an even better
year. Changes in musical tastes, with people turning away from the
American-based rap music and country and western, and the success of new
British groups like Take That and Blur.
Speaking at the launch of the report in London, Trade and Technology
Minister Ian Taylor said: ''No one disputes the importance of music in
everyone's lives, but what may not be so obvious is the financial
benefit the UK economy derives from music.''
However, he highlighted the music industry and the Government's
concern about piracy and counterfeiting, particularly of CDs by the
Chinese.

GAVIN Hastings, Scotland's rugby captain, will not play for Watsonians
in the national league match against Heriot's at Goldenacre tomorrow.
In the past three weeks the 33-year-old full back has played in two
internationals, sandwiching a hard club championship match against
Boroughmuir, and club officials believe he deserved a rest before taking
part in three more internationals in the next five weeks.
Watsonians, whose championship challenge slipped with their defeat by
Boroughmuir, have to beat Heriot's to stay in the hunt for the title. To
cover for Hastings's absence, they have switched Fergus Henderson to
full back and recalled Graeme Inglis on the right wing.
Elsewhere, half of the pack have gone after the defeat by Boroughmuir.
Jason Fayres has been restored at tighthead, David Weir and Colin
Campbell at lock, and Gordon Hannah at No.8.

AUSTRALIAN David Diaz equalled an unofficial putting world record when
he took just eight putts over the opening nine holes in the first round
of the South Australian Open yesterday.
Diaz, playing masterly golf in difficult, windy conditions, equalled
the record shared by five Americans, all playing in the United States.
He shares the lead on 67 with New Zealander Michael Long at six under
on the par-73 Royal Adelaide course.
Diaz teed off into afternoon winds gusting up to 35 knots. He shot two
eagles, including one on the par-4 eighth, where he drove 325 metres and
holed a 15-metre chip shot. Leading aggregates (Australian unless
otherwise stated):
67 -- M Long (New Zealand), D Diaz. 68 -- W Smith, J O'Keefe (USA), T
Elliott, C Gray. 69 -- D Armstrong, D Capaldo, R Stephens. 70 -- A
Painter, D Cole, P Moss (USA). 71 -- M Colandro (USA), D Galloway, D
Iwasaki-Smith, S Leaney, M Allen, G Moorhead (New Zealand), P Brew, B
King, G Chalmers, O Moore, T Price, R Backwell.

GARRISON Savannah struck a blow for National Hunt racing's elder
statesmen yesterday at Wincanton to help clinch a 1111-1 four-timer for
trainer Jenny Pitman.
The Gold Cup hero of 1991 proved that even aged 12, there is still
life at the top when claiming a second successive victory in the Racing
In Wessex Chase.
Following wins by Gilpa Valu and Nahthen Lad at Huntingdon, and Jibber
The Kibber at Wincanton, Garrison Savannah rallied on the run in to deny
odds-on favourite Young Hustler by two lengths.
His Grand National price was cut to 16-1 from 25-1 as the pair came
clear of stablemate Esha Ness, a 33-1 chance after having finished a
distance behind in third.
Pitman bought Garrison Savannah in Ireland, the same day she picked up
Esha Ness, Royal Athlete, and Willsford.
''I'll never spend a better 7500gns,'' said the trainer. ''This horse
will kill me. I'll have a heart attack one day. I never thought he would
win over two miles five furlongs in this gluey ground.''
Garrison Savannah, with 9st 4lb, and Esha Ness will spearhead a
six-strong Aintree assault by the Pitman stable.
''I'm glad this race came after the weights because 9st 4lb will do.
With six at Liverpool I don't think I will be able to stand the
strain.''
Although a 16-1 chance, Jibber The Kibber was not unfancied by his
trainer. ''He has been unlucky and would have won at Warwick but for a
horse falling in front of him,'' said Pitman.
Former smart staying chaser Espy, another 12-year-old and brother of
former Foxhunters winner Observe, launched his challenge for the
Cheltenham race with a win in the Wincanton Hunters Chase.
At Huntingdon, Gilpa Valu, the favourite, gained compensation for an
unlucky last-fence spill at Nottingham last time.
However, his supporters must have been worried when he appeared to cut
across the runner-up, Full Of Oats, at the last.
But Rod Farrant, who rode the second, said: ''He didn't interfere with
me and I was beaten at the time.''
Half an hour later Nahthen Lad landed the day's feature event. ''We've
got no set plans for him,'' said Mark Pitman, representing his mother,
''and we'll have to look in the programme book to see where we go
next.''

PAUL Wardell shot three early birdies yesterday on his way to a
three-under-par 66, which gave him his first victory in the East of
Scotland Golfers Alliance outing at Kilspindie.
Wardell, who will be full time on the Tartan Tour this year, has
stated his initial aim is to qualify for the Scottish professional
championship at Dalmahoy in May.
Jimmy Hume was one shot behind Wardell on 67 yesterday, with Gary Weir
and his two assistants Euan McIntosh and Ian Young on 68.
Jim Hastings, well into the veteran stage, won the handicap section by
a stroke with an 80 less 16, net 64, from four players. Leading scores:
Scratch: 66 -- P Wardell (Longniddry). 67 -- J Hume (Gullane). 68 -- G
Weir, E McIntosh, I Young (all Braid Hills DR). 69 -- C Morris
(Duddingston), K Kelly (Baberton), D Anderson, J R Clarkston (both
Harburn).
Handicap: 64 -- J Hastings (Mortonhall,16). 65 -- B Dunn
(Glenbervie,12), J Hay (Pitfirrane,9), J T Anderson (Kingsknowe,5), D
Brown (Glenbervie,14).
Assistants: 68 -- McIntosh, Young. 69 -- Morris. 72 -- D Drysdale

MAYBE it will get better, but 1995 has not been shaping up as a
halcyon year for football here or abroad.
So far we have had the Eric Cantona disgrace, an Italian fan stabbed
to death, a riot at Stamford Bridge, and on-going inquiries into bribery
and corruption. Happy new year.
The violence which erupted at Chelsea's ground on Wednesday night,
along with the recent killing of a Genoa fan, served to remind us that
the dreaded disease is still with us.
There have been major improvements in Scotland since the banning of
drink inside stadiums, and the only serious trouble recently has taken
place away from the grounds, in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
However, it would be foolish to believe that what might be a renewal
of the eighties phenomenon in England, when large elements of the
supporters of their clubs and international side were detested and
feared throughout Europe and beyond, could not find sympathisers north
of the Border.
Equally, the recent happenings have confirmed that all-seated stadiums
are not the panacea for crowd trouble. If thugs wish to cause bother
they will do it standing on seats just as easily as standing on
terracings.
Most of all, however, what the ugly battles between Chelsea and
Millwall supporters illustrated again is that beneath the surface of
fierce rivalry, there is a violent explosion needing only to be
detonated.
Police in Scotland have long been aware of that hidden dynamite,
particularly in Old Firm matches, and all their actions and precautions
are designed to make sure it remains latent.
That is why those few who sprang to Cantona's defence after his karate
dive into the crowd at Crystal Palace should have another close look at
their reasonings.
They may well have been blinded by their own love of football and
their desire to see it played by great exponents like the Frenchman, but
that is poor excuse for failing to see beyond the confines of the sport
itself.
If one of the Chelsea or Millwall players had behaved in Cantona
fashion on Wednesday night, it is shuddering to think of the
consequences.
It is the ever-present possibility of violent eruption among fans that
places a special responsibility on professional footballers, who are
highly paid not only because they can play, but because they are
expected to act professionally.
It really does not matter how talented, how badly treated by opponents
or referees, or how intimidated he may have been, no footballer can be
permitted to risk a full-scale riot by venting his fury outside the
ropes.
The events of Stamford Bridge should have brought home to Cantona's
apologists exactly what might have been the consequence of his manic
behaviour.
Seve chips in to bury
the hopes of hackers
THE more we hackers try to get to grips with the impossibilities of
golf, the more the smart asses of the business demonstrate how futile
our task will ever be. The great man, Seve, was at it this week, telling
the world how he and his coach, Mac Grady, took a cardboard box full of
pictures showing him swinging badly and buried it in the desert.
Do people like Ballesteros not appreciate what such a jaunty little
tale does to the rest of us? Does he not appreciate that half the
rabbits of the world have been sweating and straining and cursing and
swearing for umpteen years trying to swing as badly as him.
If he has been swinging poorly, we should all head for the desert and
dump the clubs beside his pictures. Give us a break, Seve.

AS the blood pressure rises among the faithful, Love Street most
certainly is not living up to its name. Saints are sinners. The once
proud men from Paisley are weaving a pattern that, according to fans
ready to stage a demonstration tomorrow during St Mirren's
first-division match against Raith Rovers, is leading to disaster.
Relegation, even oblivion, is facing the men who play in black and
white -- with, as is the usual case, the manager taking the flak. At the
moment, Jimmy Bone is in the black zone so far as the paying customers
are concerned.
But where lack of money is the root of most football evils, listening
to Money may give the Paisley diehards cause for more thought.
Campbell Money has been with St Mirren for his entire senior career --
17 years out of the 34 he has to his name. The keeper probably will go
down in history as the George Niven of Rangers type of player -- one of
the finest never to have been awarded a full cap.
Yet, it is worth listening to the man, now assistant to Bone, who has
served under eight St Mirren managers. He names with hardly a thought --
Alex Ferguson, Jim Clunie, Ricky McFarlane, Alex Miller, Alex Smith,
Tony Fitzpatrick, David Hay, and Bone.
He has known the highs and lows since becoming first-team choice in
goal in the 1983-84 season, none more so than being in the side which
lost 5-1 to Forfar in the League Cup, then went on during the same 86-87
season to win a Scottish Cup medal with a 1-0 win over Dundee United.
His message is simple. ''Every team goes through a cycle. We were on a
high finishing third in the league under Fergie in the late 70s. The cup
win under Alex Smith was another, and, remember, Jimmy Bone was his
assistant.
''We're going through a bad spell. Everyone at the club does not need
to be reminded about that. Our confidence is low, but Jimmy Bone, coach
Kenny McDowall, and myself believe that we will come through it.
''Lack of experience has been our main problem but, to solve that, you
need money, it's not there. But everyone is backing the manager, and we
know that if the players can gain the confidence they need from a couple
of victories -- we've not been playing that badly -- then we can go on
from there.''
Raith Rovers, on a run of seven straight league victories, are in a
promotion position that Saints probably would give part of their
redeveloping stadium for, and trying to prise themselves clear of that
third-bottom spot tomorrow will be tough.
But, as Money and his fellow backroom staff say: ''We've got to start
somewhere.''

SEVERIANO Ballesteros, playing his last European Tour event until
after the US Masters in April, is set to go out in style after a superb
first round at the Canary Islands Open in Gran Canaria yesterday.
The 37-year-old Spanish maestro, going round in the worst of the
weather, shot a four-under-par 68 to share the lead with Irishman Philip
Walton, England's Paul Eales, and Gary Orr of Scotland -- but there was
little doubt he played the best golf of the day.
Walton and Eales both played in the morning in almost ideal
conditions, but as Ballesteros teed off in the afternoon, the wind got
up and made scoring difficult.
''Maybe it was worth two or three shots better,'' said Ballesteros at
the end of his round. ''But this was the best I have played from tee to
green for a long time.''
Despite sinking two monster putts, one of 40 feet at the eleventh and
another of 60ft at the thirteenth, Ballesteros insisted putting was not
the key to his good round.
''On the front nine, I had many birdie chances and made none,'' he
said. ''But I drove very well and missed only two fairways.''
Asked if he could win the tournament, the Spaniard smiled and said:
''I intend to remain humble, as always. That is the key to this game.
Never say what might happen.''
Orr, starting at the tenth in the afternoon, also had to cope with the
wind, and was one over par after eight. But he had five birdies in his
last 10 holes to snatch a share of the lead.
''I was a bit rusty at the beginning of the season,'' said Orr. ''But
I was not worried because today I played really well -- my best shot was
a three wood to eight feet at the eighth.''
Walton had only one bogey and five birdies in his 68, and said he owed
it to good putting and the fact he chipped in from 50ft at the first
hole -- his tenth.
Eales, by contrast, said he was nervous on very fast greens. He added:
''I hit down the middle all day and was never in trouble. ''It was a
very satisfying round, and my only problem was fighting against taking
three putts. But I only did so once.''
Late in the day, England's Gary Emerson threatened to take the lead
when he went to four under after 12 holes. But he dropped a shot at the
fourteenth and, after a birdie at the sixteenth, dropped another at the
next.
He had to be content with joint fifth on 69, with Kent's Jamie Spence
and Sweden's Robert Karlsson.

* TONY Johnstone, the defending champion, returned a six-under-par 66
in the opening round of the South African Open yesterday.
He leads by two shots from four players, including fellow Zimbabwean
Mark McNulty.
Johnstone went out in 31 with five birdies in seven holes from the
second. But he started back bogey, birdie, bogey, and had to wait until
the last hole before getting back on track, when he hit a No.3 wood to
three feet and tapped in for an eagle three. Ernie Els finished six
shots off the pace despite also eagling the last.
''It's such a relief to stand on the tee and know where your ball is
going to go,'' said Johnstone. ''I haven't had that feeling for eight
months. ''I went back to England for two weeks and worked with my coach
and it has paid off.'' Leading scores:
66 -- T Johnstone (Zimbabwe).
68 -- M McNulty (Zimbabwe), J Johnson (U.S.), S Hendley (U.S.), A
McLardy.
69 -- D Robertson (U.S.).
70 -- R Goosen, I Hutchings, S van Vuuren, M Ure (Britain).

NICK Faldo was grumbling. ''I turned what could have been a 66 into a
71,'' he said after another dreadful day on the greens in the opening
round of the Buick Invitational on the 7000-yard South course at Torrey
Pines yesterday.
His one under par card left the 37-year-old Briton six strokes behind
the early leaders on 65. They included the 1993 champion Phil Mickelson,
Dan Pohl and David Edwards. Payne Stewart and David Ogrin were on 66
with the defending champion, Craig Stadler, and the Ryder Cup veteran
Larry Nelson on 67.
''It's the putter not the puttee,'' moaned Faldo who missed a handful
of short putts including a three-footer on the green at the short
sixteenth.
He went out in 36 but began to get into his best stride by holing
birdie putts of four feet and eight feet on the eleventh and thirteenth
greens.
Northern Ireland's David Feherty scored a fine 69 while Jesper
Parnevik had a 72. Faldo will have to play hard on the shorter North
course tomorrow to be sure to qualify. Early scores:
65 -- P Mickelson, D Pohl, C Dimarco, D Edwards.
66 -- P Stewart, B Faxon, H Sutton, D Ogrin, G Burns, C Chamblee.
67 -- L Nelson, C Stadler, K Gibson, J Hayes.
68 -- C Byrom, P Jacobsen, B Wadkins, Y Mizumaki (Japan), N Henke.
69 -- D Feherty (Northern Ireland), B Kamm, J Mahaffey.
70 -- B Tway, J Mudd, K Clearwater, C Beck, J Ozaki (Japan).
71 -- M Calcavechia, N Faldo (GB).
72 -- J Parnevik (Sweden), W Levi, S Elkington, D Waldorf, B Bryant.
73 -- B Crenshaw, D Stockton Jr

KAREN Macleod, who finished fourth in the Commonwealth Games marathon
last year, is the only woman pre-selected by Britain for the world
championships in Gothenburg.
Edinburgh Athletic Club's Macleod, born in Kenya, brought up on Skye,
but now based near Bath, confirmed yesterday that she was accepting the
place.
Richard Nerurkar, fourth in the European championship race last year
in Helsinki, had already accepted the only male early selection offered.
The others will be named following the London Marathon on April 2, which
could mean a place for Liz McColgan if she makes a successful comeback.
Macleod, an asthmatic, has turned down a lucrative run in the Toronto
Marathon to accept August's championship race in Sweden. ''I feel I have
something to prove,'' she said. ''I did not perform well last time I ran
for Britain, at the world championships two years ago, when I finished
sixteenth.
''The conditions were really difficult for me, and I take exception to
the suggestion from selectors that I was more committed, and prepared
better, at the Commonwealths, in Victoria, when I was running for

There she collapsed, demolishing a feeding station table, cutting a
leg and injuring a hip, yet she got up to run the fastest time of her
life.
The performances which confirmed her place, however, conclusive
evidence of her continued form, were a high placing in Brazil's Sao
Silvestre road race on Hogmanay, and second in the Marakesh half
marathon last month with a time of 71-40. She finished just 14 seconds
behind Italy's Olga Ferraro, who was fourth in last year's European
championship marathon.
The result was one of the few good things about the Marakesh trip.
Macleod has a life-long aversion to snakes, and was terrified by a
couple of cobras produced in a market bazaar by a snake charmer. ''I
took off, raced away. Half the crowd followed me because they thought
I'd spotted a bargain. I was just petrified.
''When I was four, and living in Kenya, a mamba came in the window
when my sister and I were in our bath. We shrieked and shrieked until
somebody rushed in and killed it. And I've been paranoid ever since.
''In fact, I probably owe my running ability to snakes. When I was at
school, on Skye, I knew there were adders on the golf course where we
did cross-country -- there was a preserved body of one which had been
killed on the course, in a jar in our biology lab. It gave me the
shivers. I used to hurtle round the course, just to get it over. The
year after I left, a boy was bitten doing cross-country.
''That was how I discovered I'd the ability to run.
''I feel I am sitting on a good marathon time now, possibly sub 2hr
30min. I hope, if I can do that, that I'll be pre-selected for next
year's Olympics.''

Glen Stewart, the Scottish 3000m champion, has been given a guest run

Scottish 60m record (7.36) with Mel Neef, has a guest lane in the
sprint.

federation secretary Bob Greenoak revealed that negotiations with a
possible backer had begun. ''A final decision will be made within a few
days,'' he confirmed.

EIGHT championship best performances beaten or equalled, and one
national age- group record smashed by dead-heating winners, were
testimony to improving standards yesterday at the TSB Scottish Schools
indoor athletics championships in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall, writes Doug
Gillon.
Ally Donaldson, from Stewart's Melville, revealed more of his
prodigious talent by winning the over-16 400 metres in a
record-equalling 50.00sec. The former AAA champion at 800m, 1500m, and
3000m sandwiched this contest between two crucial schools rugby matches.
With 27 tries to his credit this year, he will help his team against
joint leaders Watson's, on Saturday.
Despite a rugby knock sustained a day earlier, Loretto's Adam Lowles
put up a tremendous battle against Portobello's Andrew Lees in the
senior 200m. The judges could not separate them, both given 22.3, which,
but for the lack of electronic timing apparatus, would be a national
under-17 record (22.41). Add Lees' record-equalling 60m win in 7.05, and
it was a glorious confirmation of recovery for a man who was on crutches
six months ago after a knee surgery.
Lee McConnell was the most successful female, with a double in the
200m and high jump, including a record in the former with 25.4sec.
* COLIN Jackson's unbeaten hurdles run came to end last night in
Madrid after 44 races. The Welshman and Allen Johnson clocked 7.42, but
the American got the verdict. Irina Privalova set a world 50m record en
route to equalling her own world 60m best, with 5.96 and 6.92
respectively.

JOHN Higgins continued to justify his wild-card invitation to the
Benson &amp; Hedges Masters snooker championship at the Wembley Conference
Centre yesterday.
The Scot maintained his excellent form of late to scupper Alan
McManus' hopes of defending the title.
And after Higgins had completed an impressive 5-2 quarter-final
victory, McManus said: ''John is on a roll. He's playing superbly. He'll
take some stopping.''
Higgins, winner of the Skoda Grand Prix in October and runner-up in
the Regal Welsh Open 11 days ago, will meet Jimmy White tomorrow for a
place in the final.
White, despite a fast start, made his share of unforced errors in a
5-3 victory over Thailand's James Wattana.
''From 2-0 I didn't play all that well,'' admitted White after a
much-needed result which gave him two victories in an event for the
first time in nine attempts this season.
Breaks of 67 and 85 gave White his start, but Wattana, another member
of the game's elite having a less than productive season, hauled his way
back into contention, winning three of the following four frames to
level at 3-3 before White regained the advantage.

FIONA Brown of Greenacres moved to the top of the rankings yesterday
evening after four rounds of play in the Bank of Scotland Junior Curling
Championships in Kilmarnock's Galleon Centre.
In the last of three games yesterday, Brown beat Ayr's Kirsty Drummond
by 6-4 to maintain her 100% record. This was Drummond's only defeat so
far and she was joined on three wins by Stranraer's Catherine Wright who
beat Sheila Swan of Kinross by 10-4.
At the other end of the table, Alison Meechan of Lockerbie went down
to her fourth defeat out of four to Lesley Stobo of Hamilton and, for
her, a semi-final place at the weekend now looks unlikely.
In the men's event, Tom Brewster of Lockerbie tops the table with
three wins out of three. His victims yesterday were former world junior
champion James Dryburgh of Aviemore, who went down by 5-7, and
Murrayfield's Chris Hildrey, who was beaten by 8-1.

IT was far removed from the glitz and glory of Doug Williams' playing
days this week as the veteran quarterback sat down to set out some
'offensive plays'' for the Scottish Claymores, our first national
American football team, who will compete in the World League of American
Football when it kicks off in April.
The Claymores' wide-receivers' mastermind met up with head coach Lary
Kuharich at Tierra Verde in Florida at the start of a month-long
think-tank, in which the pair will formulate tactics for a side who have
never played together, most of whom have never met, and with a notable
number living across the Pond.
Making the scenario stranger still, though, is the involvement of
Williams with the embryonic team at all. For here is a man who is a
living legend in his home country and an inspiration to thousands of
aspiring coloured American football players. Yet your average Scottish
sports fan would not know him from Adam.
It was Williams, of the Washington Redskins, who, in Super Bowl XXII
in 1988, rewrote the record books. He broke through a then strong racial
barrier to become the first black quarterback on a winning team,
smashing four long-standing Super Bowl playing records in the process,
and helping his side to an emphatic 42-10 win over the Denver Broncos.
So, how does this enigma come to be coaching with the little-known
Claymores?
''To understand,'' Williams said, ''I'm going to have to backtrack a
little.''
His induction into the hearts of a football-infatuated American public
was not as straightforward as such a short curriculum vitae would
suggest. Having led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the National Football
League play-offs on three occasions, by 1982 Williams was relegated to
playing in the now defunct United States Football League. By 1987 he had
managed to sign for the Redskins -- as a free agent -- starting the
season as a back-up.
If, then, his progression to the berth of first-choice quarterback
that campaign was startling, so, too, was his decline from prominence at
the end of his playing career in 1989. Coaching posts with state
colleges were applied for with no success and a recurring ''no
experience'' response forced him to aim lower.
''I had always said, even before my playing days, that coaching was
something I wanted to do. So, when I was turned down for college posts,
I took the opportunity to return to my old high school to coach,''
Williams explained.
Since then, Williams has filled a number of more prominent coaching
posts and now maintains a move to the World League of American Football
is far from a come down. In fact, he sees it as a ''progressive career
move'' which will lead towards realising another ambition.
''My philosophy is that you should concentrate on what you would like
to be doing with your life and my goal is to one day be a college head
coach. I feel the opportunity to coach the Scottish Claymores will add
to the experience I need to realise that ambition.''
Only seven native-born Scots have played themselves into the Claymores
for an opening encounter with the Rhein Fire at Murrayfield on 9 April.
The remainder of the team comprise NFL hopefuls, hungry to impress on
what promises to be a well-publicised world stage.
Having never been to Scotland, Williams has only ever seen photographs
of the 67,500 all-seater Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh. He said it
was a ''beautiful arena'' and draws further confidence in his side's
home contingent from the game normally played on that hallowed turf.
''I don't know what rugby is like, but I do know you've got all these
guys walking around with no pads on. I'm terrified of the Scots guys
already.''

NINE winners in the past month have given Len Lungo a comfortable lead
of three over his nearest rival Peter Monteith in the race for The
Herald's Leading Scottish Trainer Award.
The Carrutherstown trainer, who was made evens favourite to win the
championship, had a slow start to the season but, since the new year,
the Hetland Hill yard has been in tremendous form.
This was confirmed at Carlisle on Tuesday when 11-year-old veteran
Another Dyer came home nine lengths clear of his rivals, and Santa
Concerto showed a devastating turn of foot in the bumper to easily
dispose of the opposition and win by 15 lengths.
Lungo's odds have been cut to 1-2, with Monteith on 2-1. The only
other serious contender, Colin Parker, is quoted at 10-1.
Not only is Lungo dominating the Scottish scene, but, with nine
winners from 50 runners in a 28 day-period, he was only bettered
nationwide by David Nicholson and Martin Pipe.
Eight days ago, he scored a double at Sedgefield with two other
promising youngsters, Livio, a four-year-old bought off the Flat from
John Gosden, and Oat Couture, bred in Dumfriesshire by Alix Stevenson
and soon to race over fences.
With these recent successes, which included Sheelin Lad lifting a
major prize for the feature novices' chase at Ayr last month, it appears
that Lungo has fearsome ammunition with which to establish himself as
Scotland's No.1 jumps trainer.
At this stage last year he had 13 winners and finished on 27, his
highest total. Now, in only his fifth season, he has 15 winners and
every prospect of improving on last season.
Monteith may not have as many horses in his Rosewell yard, but having
led the championship from the first day -- when Beldine won at Perth --
until a week ago, he has by no means given up the fight.
Colin Parker, on nine winners, is another with more quality than
quantity in his yard. Trump has scored four times, while Boarding School
is coming back to his best form, and Sparky Gayle looks to be in a
different class on his showing at Ayr recently.
Competition is keen among the permit-holders with Alistair Whillans on
four winners from 15 runners, followed by his brother, Donald, and Dawn
Goodfellow on three.

CHEMICALS group BOC reported profits at the lower end of city
expectations in the first quarter of the year.
In the three months to December 31, the industrial gases manufacturer
made pre-tax profits of #89.4m compared with a previous loss of #8.9m.
The loss was due to restructuring charges of #85m.
Excluding the effect of the charges, profits this year grew by 16%.
Group turnover in the first quarter was 4% higher at #873.7m.
The gases business achieved a 15% increase in operating profit
compared with the same period a year ago, helped by a strong performance
by BOC gases in the US. There was also good trading in its South African
operations but margins remained under pressure in the UK.
Demand continued to grow in most North Pacific markets except Japan
where the earthquake that affected the region around Kobe disrupted
operations. BOC said that immense efforts are continuing to be made to
sustain deliveries of essential supplies to hospitals and other
customers despite severe transport difficulties.
Profits at Ohmeda, its healthcare business, rose by 6.4%. Profits were
boosted by the sale of the Medical Engineering Systems business. Profits
in the pharmaceutical business remained steady although sales of the
Suprane anaesthetic were impacted by equipment modifications.
BOC has said that it intends to redirect its pharmaceuticals research
and development towards inhaled medicines at the expense of its
traditional areas of anaesthesia and operating drugs. Last year, BOC
suffered from the expiry of the US patent on its main anaesthetic
Forane, in spite of the launch of the Suprane replacement.
Vacuum technology and distribution services operating profit advanced
by 31%, continuing the strong growth trend of last year in Edward vacuum
products. This reflects continuing buoyant demand from the world
semiconductor industry.
Going forward BOC should be able to raise the prices of its industrial
gases in line with increases made by some of its rivals. BOC shares
performed strongly in 1994 after a disastrous 1993 when the impact of
loss of patent protection hit pharmaceutical results.
However, with the gases business now recovering, the worst is probably
behind the healthcare division and the valuation probably reasonable for
this stage of the cycle, chemicals analysts at Goldman Sachs expect the
shares to continue to attract support. Yesterday BOC added 2p to 720p.

TOTTENHAM Hotspur's revival on the football pitch has not been passed
on to shareholders in the football club.
It lifted taxable profits to #2.06m in the six months to November 30
from #640,000 in the corresponding period a year earlier.
However, after splashing out millions on international stars, costly
ground improvements and the effects of a #1.5m fine, shareholders are
again not getting an interim dividend.
''Our cash flow position was disrupted by the fine of unprecedented
proportions levied upon the club by the Football Association of #1.5m,''
said chairman Alan Sugar.
''This money would, in ordinary circumstances, have been available for
dividend payments to shareholders or player purchases.''
Spurs was fined for financial irregularities, including alleged
''bungs'' to players in transfer deals. An FA ban on taking part in the
FA Cup and a league points deduction were recently overturned after an
appeal.

<HEADLINE>Telecommunications giant's redundancy costs set to stabilise Benefits ahead for BT</HEADLINE>

THE incredible shrinking workforce of British Telecommunications is
set to stabilise soon, several years earlier than some industry
observers thought likely.
Employee numbers have come down from 215,000 to 145,000 over four
years and the figure for the financial year beginning in April is
expected to be under 10,000. In 1994-95 over 15,000 will depart, more
than the group had anticipated.
Finance director Robert Brace said they hoped that the redundancy
scheme would finish in 1995-96. As he pointed out the workforce could
hardly carry on declining by 15,000-20,000, though there may be further
reductions from time to time.
BT has handled the inevitable scaling back of the workforce caused by
technological advance and increasing efficiency with few major
complaints. It was achieved voluntarily and some employees have found
work elsewhere in the expanding telecommunications industry. The scheme
is officially due to finish in September 1996.
The end of redundancy costs will give a major fillip to profits, given
that the charge came to #368m in the nine months to December and will
top the previously expected #750m for the full year.
BT's profits in the third quarter (to December) were actually lower at
#660m against #698m even after a #33m benefit from a disposal. This
reflected further price cuts. Nine months' profits came to #2153m but on
a comparable basis would have shown a 7% fall at #2045m.
To meet its price cap, inland call prices were reduced by an overall
12% which was only partly mitigated by a 7% increase in call volume. So
revenue from this source declined nearly 5% to #184m. Cheaper weekend
calls were introduced in December 1992, peak rate was abolished last
March, and uniform long-distance call rates came in last September. The
third quarter saw an 8.4% drop in revenue.
International calls recorded 4% volume growth but turnover fell 2.4%
owing to price cuts. Growth is being held back by a decline in transit
traffic.
Exchange line rental revenue was up 4.5% in the nine months, with
price increases largely offset by the light user scheme. Business
connections were up 5.6% and residential connections up 1.1%, despite
competition from cable operators. The number of telephones installed is
now 27 million.
On the costs front these rose 1% in nine months, excluding redundancy
payments. Significant increases in sales related costs were offset by
lower employment expenses and property disposals. Marketing spending
jumped 10.7% to #255m, much of this going on boosting Cellnet. This paid
off as mobile phone turnover soared 43%. The number of users rose 50% to
1,560,000, approaching Vodafone's total.
Figures released by Oftel, the regulatory body, showed that Cable &amp;
Wireless's share of phone revenue edged up one point to 10% in 1993-94,
while BT has at last slipped below 90%. Regulator Don Cruickshank
released the information because he was concerned about the lack of
high-quality information available on the market.
BT remains the colossus of the industry but now Mercury is a positive
giant despite the myriad of tiddlers now in the market. Including cable
operators and various business service providers there are 21 fixed link
operators. There are three mobile phone services.
The third-quarter figures were in line with expectations but there is
some nervousness about the deterioration in relations between BT and Mr
Cruickshank. In his statement BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance notes ''an
increasingly unpredictable regulatory climate''.
The latest manifestation of this is Oftel's proposals to force BT to
publish how it works out fees to charge Mercury and others for access to
its network which they use to deliver their calls. BT accused Oftel of
wanting to acquire new powers which went beyond what were necessary to
render BT's accounting procedures transparent.
Mercury is waging a vociferous campaign to change the system which
will cost it some #60m this year. It argues that it should only have to
pay the marginal cost of BT's provision of services to Mercury rather
than a proportion of the total costs of the network. It is going through
the courts to challenge a ruling by Mr Cruickshank on connection
charges.
The company argues that the Oftel director-general had misinterpreted
the relevant passage in BT's licence. Yesterday it won leave from the
Law Lords to take its case to the courts for a legal interpretation.
Success would be a tremendous shot in the arm for Mercury which has
not been finding the going so easy lately, without being very costly to
BT.
However, the regulatory challenges should not be exaggerated in the
context of the growth market in which BT operates and the potential it
has in Europe as the market there is liberalised.
Cost reduction will slow as the redundancy programme draws to a close
but on the other hand the heavy charge on profits, which has been a
feature for years, will decline.
The shares, up 1[1/2]p at 397[1/2]p, sell at an unjustified small
discount to the market and rest on solid foundations.

<HEADLINE>Fledgling Calluna sees turnover leap</HEADLINE>

HI-TECH pioneer Calluna, which was floated in October, increased
interim turnover by more than 400% to #409,000, as it prepared to feed
the next generation of mini-computers.
However, operating charges of #1.47m in the six months to September
were up 42% on the corresponding period last year because of increased
early stage development costs. The fledgling company's operating loss
was up 11% to #1.06m.
The results from the miniature disc-drive specialist were very closely
in line with projections made in the run-up to flotation. They cover the
period preceding the Glenrothes-based company's Unlisted Securities
Market placing, which raised #10.1m.
At that time, Calluna estimated that it would move into profit in the
late spring or early summer of this year.
Managing director Norman White would not be drawn on the likely timing
of this yesterday, pointing out that it related to the next financial
year, but said: ''Things are moving along the directions that we planned
to have them move.''
However, James Warhurst, of the company's Birmingham-based broker
Albert E Sharp, believes Calluna will move into profit in the second
quarter of its next financial year.
Forecasting a loss of up to #2.5m in the current financial year and a
#4.5m annual profit to March 1996, he said: ''Nobody is expecting
absolutely instant fireworks out of Calluna but, in the general run of
these things, it will be relatively quick.''
When the company was floated on October 31, its shares soared from
their 65p strike price to 92p, boosting the market value of Calluna by
about #15m over the expected #35m price-tag. Yesterday, the shares
closed down 1p on 79p, against the backdrop of a rising market.
One of the company's selling points is undoubtedly the future
potential of the lap-top and notebook computer market, which can use the
patented pocket-sized ''Callunacard'' hard disc-drive.
However, a number of other possible applications in the US, in the
fields of factory automation, and aircraft and motor car monitoring
equipment, as well as printers, have emerged in the last two or three
months.
Calluna, which employs 52 people, also demonstrated prototype versions
of its 260-megabyte disc drive at the Comdex show in Las Vegas in
November. The company has also expanded its European and US sales and
marketing operations.
Since the flotation, Calluna has invested in its supply lines, to
ensure consistent availability of quality components.
Laying the foundations for ''very pleasantly surprising'' levels of
interest, Calluna, which has no bank debt, has also invested in its
general manufacturing operations.
The company believes the benefits of the initial investment of cash
raised from the placing should be realised over the coming months.
October's flotation was three times oversubscribed. Dr White and his
founding directors hold around one-quarter of the total equity, with
institutions and existing private investors owning the rest.
Albert E Sharp, the sponsor broker, predicted an annual turnover of
more than #200m in a few years.

ANOTHER major Chinese success story comes from Babcock International
which has won contracts to supply four coal-fired boilers together worth
about #200m.
With orders gained last month, Babcock now has a base load of
contracts for China totalling about #325m which will guarantee
employment at the Renfrew facility until at least 1998.
The joint consortium with Westinghouse Electric of the US has received
a conditional letter of award from Shandong China Power Company for a
700mw power station at Heze and a 1300mw complex at Liaocheng in
Shandong Province. The total value of the contracts is over $600m, of
which Babcock's share is about $300m.
Other participants include Electricite de France International and
China Light &amp; Power Company of Hong Kong. The deal has still to be
formally concluded and is subject to satisfactory financing and other
conditions.
Managing director of Babcock International Group's Energy Division,
Duncan Cox said that the exact amount of work that will be done in
Renfrew has yet to be decided while design will be shared between
Crawley and Renfrew.
In January, Babcock, in association with Westinghouse and American
engineering consultants Sargant &amp; Lundy, was awarded a contract for two
700mw power stations at Dandong and Dailan in Liaoning Provoince with
the British company's share worth #125m for four boilers.
Mr Cox said that he was bidding for work in India, Vietnam and also in
China but there was nothing firm as yet.
Babcock shares rose [1/2]p to 28p.

<HEADLINE>Visible trade gap grows to #640m</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with the rest of the world grew to #640m
in November after a downward revision from #644m to #553m in October,
much in line with market projections.
The value of total exports in the month was up 3% on October at
#12.1bn, while imports rose 3.5% to #12.7bn.
Both exports and imports are continuing to grow and this is regarded
as bullish in that it indicates that the economy continues on course
although there are also fears that it has been growing too fast, hence
the Chancellor's imposition of interest rate hikes to curb perceived
future inflationary pressures.
For November, the deficit with the EU countries expanded from
October's #132m to #205m with the growth in imports outstripping
exports. The previously reported December deficit for non-EU countries
had shown a significant and unexpected deterioration against market
expectations, albeit this included imports of works of art and
jewellery, regarded as erratic items.
Excluding oil and erratic items, such as ships, aircraft, precious
stones and silver, the volume, as opposed to value, of exports in
November grew by 2% and the volume of exports by 3%. Taking one month's
figures in isolation is always risky, though, as the authorities are
fond of pointing out unless it is particularly favourable one.
Taking the three months to November, the value of exports increased by
3[1/2]% and imports by 3% -- both largely the result of increased trade
with the EU. In volume terms, again excluding oil and erratic items,
exports advanced 5% and imports 3%.
It is difficult to come to any hard and fast conclusions from the
November showing (and December's non-EU outcome) but overall there are
signs that the big improvement in the UK's trade deficit may be
levelling off with exports coming off the boil a little.
But certainly there are no real worries at present. Analysts said that
growth rates did not suggest any major slowdown in the economy at the
end of last year. Industry's export expectations are still high and with
the consumer sector still relatively subdued and higher mortgages and
taxes in the offing, import penetration should be blunted. Sterling's
weakness will also work against imports although this is a two-edged
sword since this increases inflationary pressures.
Trade Minister Richard Needham yesterday welcomed the November trade
figures. He said: ''British companies are continuing to forge ahead
around the world. In November alone Britain's exports were worth #12.1bn
-- the highest ever in any month. This is further evidence of the
strength of the export-led recovery.''

SCOTTISH Television strongly denied suggestions yesterday that Kirsty
Young's early evening chat show is to be cancelled. ''We've done a great
deal to bring her on. She is one of our top personalities. There's no
way we're going to axe her,'' said a senior executive.
The twice-a-week show will run as scheduled until March and a new
series has been pencilled in for the autumn. Ms Young will continue to
front the lunchtime news programme, Scotland Today, in the intervening
period.
However, Scottish is planning to look at the possibility of
rescheduling the next series to a later time. A spokesman said: ''With a
programme which goes out at 5.10pm there are some serious subjects you
cannot tackle because children are watching.''
Press reports earlier this week claimed that, though the viewing
figures for the show were reasonable, it was facing the axe because
Scottish Television considered that the chat show formula was ''worn
out''.
The spokesman added: ''I don't know where this rumour came from, but I
suspect that it is from someone with an axe to grind. There is no truth
in it whatsoever.''

<HEADLINE>Leak reveals Government proposal to change rules on consulting the public. Fears of new move to ease NHS closures</HEADLINE>

EXCLUSIVE
SEPARATE consultation over hospital closures should be abolished,
according to a leaked Scottish Office document.
Health boards have been required since 1975 to undertake public
consultation on proposals to shut specific hospitals.
New arrangements would remove this and amalgamate it into a general
obligation on boards to consult on their three-year purchasing plans.
The Herald has seen details of the proposals which are outlined in a
draft report sent out to board general managers by the director of
purchasing at the Scottish NHS Management Executive.
The revelation comes in the wake of increasing anxiety over the
Government's commitment to genuine public consultation in the NHS.
Earlier this week, The Herald revealed that Mearnskirk Hospital at
Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, is being sold off to developers during the
actual consultation process, and before closure has been approved.
An unprecedented spate of hospital closures is also anticipated over
the next five years as the Government seeks to reshape the service and
cut at least 5000 beds in Scotland.
Labour's Scottish health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, said: ''This is
a most unwelcome development, which we would forcefully resist.
''It is a clear attempt to open up the way for the Government to do
what it likes with hospitals,'' he said.
''Public consultation over three-year plans makes any debate more
diffuse and much less focused. It makes it more difficult for people to
defend their hospitals and easier for boards and trusts to close them,''
the MP for Dundee East added.
A spokeswoman for the British Medical Association said: ''It is a
fundamental right that the public, served by a particular hospital,
should have a say in its future. The present system allows for that
democratic process.
''We would also question the efficacy of a three-year plan to purchase
care for patients, given the rapid change in medical provision,'' she
added.
Mr John Ramage, convener of the Scottish Association of Health
Councils, said he would be concerned if there was any dilution of
consultation.
However, the report stresses the new approach is a sensible and
logical way forward.
''The essence of consultation is the communication of a genuine
invitation to give advice, and a genuine receipt of that advice,''
It was particularly important to consult when purchasing plans had
implications for services, either by shifting to different providers or
withdrawing a service.
Quality of service was also an important issue. ''A board may wish to
shift provision of a service to a facility which is new or unknown to
the public. It needs to be recognised that this may cause uncertainty,
particularly with vulnerable patients,'' the report says.
''Alternatively, a board may wish to purchase a specialist service in
a more distant centre, when it is seen as being safer or more effective
than the service purchased locally.''
After consultation, the board would submit its proposals to the
Management Executive for approval by the Scottish Secretary.
''In giving approval to the plan, Ministers would also endorse any
specific changes in service provision (such as the closure of a
particular hospital) which would result from the purchasing strategy.
There would be no need for further consultation when the actual closure
took place'', according to the report.
It says the new system would take time to implement and was unlikely
to cover purchasing plans beginning this year. Transitional arrangements
would apply in the interim.
''If a board has consulted under the terms of this circular, and its
purchasing plan has been approved by the Management Executive, no
further consultation on hospital closures is needed,'' the report
concludes.

BRITAIN'S largest car dealership group Lex Service is restructuring
its retail operations at a cost of #14.5m which will be charged as an
exceptional itemm in thw 1994 accounts.
This will be more than offset by gains on the sale of properties and
the disposal of businesses. The total saving will be in excess of #4m
annually and with bigger savings comong later.
Some 80 staff, mainly in managerial posts, will lose their jobs.
Of these, 50 of the redundancies will go from its retail group head
office in Bourne End, Bucks, with the rest spread around the UK.
Lex is changing from a franchise-based structure to a more regional
basis. Focusing more on customers' needs was another of the group's
principal aims.
The shares closed 6p weaker at 282p.

BASS has seen a 1.3% fall in beer volumes on a like-for-like basis in
the first 16 weeks of the financial year but the resultant shortfall in
gross profits has been substantially recoved by cost savings and price
increases.
Chairman Sir Ian Prosser told yesterday's annual meeting that there
had been a 3.7% fall in off-trade sales which he blamed partly on
imports from France.
In answer to questions, he pointed out that these now amounted to
production equivalent to the combined output of Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley,
Vaux.
However, Bass is ''unashamedly'' exporting beer to France where the
local duty is just one seventh of that paid in the UK and then brought
back to Britain by tourist and other purchasers.
Executive remuneration was the major topic of the meeting with Sir Ian
stating that the attitude of the press to pay in the UK was ''quite
wrong'' as Bass is increasingly competing for top management resource.
His total package including pension contributions rose last year from
#615,000 to #707,000 although over the last three years, the total cost
of the Bass board had risen by just 1%.
The remuneration committee includes Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy of Kingfisher
who received #1.3m last year.

DIRECT Line, the biggest motor insurer in the UK, will open the
telephone lines to its customers interested in buying its new life
insurance products from next Wednesday.
Around 1.5 million existing motor and household policyholders have
been sent details of a range of life insurance products under Direct
Line's income protection plan, the parent Royal Bank of Scotland said
yesterday.
''We expect there to be quite heavy demand at the beginning,'' a
spokesman said, adding that initial levels of customer interest in the
company's move into life insurance had been encouraging.
The products, including term assurance, mortgage protection, family
income cover, disability cover and whole life policies, will initially
only be available to Direct Line customers.
The company, a pioneer in the field of telephone insurance, has no
immediate plans for media advertising and will ''cold call'' potential
customers.
Direct Line rose to No 1 private motor insurer in 10 years from launch
with a successful telephone marketing formula, which cut the cost of
insurance for many motorists. In the process, it made its founder, Peter
Wood, a fortune.

<HEADLINE>Oil leaking from Scapa wreck of the Royal Oak</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>17</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979927489</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A BATTLESHIP sunk 55 years ago in Scapa Flow is posing a serious
danger of pollution.
It is feared that oil escaping from HMS Royal Oak, torpedoed by the
German submarine U-47 in October 1939, could kill thousands of seabirds.
The hull is starting to break up, with the possibility that tanks
could burst releasing hundreds of tons of oil.
Royal Navy divers are inspecting the Royal Oak, an official war grave.
She went down with the loss of 831 men.
David Mitchell, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said
yesterday: ''This has come as complete news to me. I hadn't appreciated
there was now a slick two or three miles long from the wreck.
''If there was a sudden rupture, you could be talking about major
pollution and the loss of seabirds -- divers, auks, and sea ducks.''
Mr Mitchell added that the situation highlighted the problem of vast
quantities of highly toxic waste, including mustard gas, that was dumped
off Northern Ireland and the west coast of Scotland after the Second
World War.
A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council said: ''The hull is now in a
dangerous condition and it could go almost any time.''
Every October, a Remembrance service is held above the wreck and a
White Ensign replaced on the ship's superstructure during the annual
inspection.
Diving on the Royal Oak, in 27 metres of water, is banned to everyone
but the Royal Navy. It was during the last inspection that the hull was
found to be disintegrating.
When the Royal Oak went down, she was carrying about 3500 tons of
fuel. ''The spot where the ship went down can be seen from the air
because of the oily sheen on the surface,'' said the council spokesman.
Salvage teams are considering pumping the oil out of the tanks to a
barge before safe disposal.
The technique was used on a German wreck lying in 90 metres of water
off the Norwegian coast last year.

SCOTTISH Mutual, the life office arm of the Abbey National Bank, is
holding its annual bonus rate for the life unitised with profits fund at
7.5% but the pension annual bonus rate has been marginally reduced from
10% to 9.5% where it remains high competitive.
All other rates of reversionary bonus declared for 1994 remain at the
interim rate applied during the year. However, additional terminal
bonuses, paid at the time the policy matures, have been lowered in line
with the industry.
The effect of the changes are illustrated through a male non-smoker
paying #50-a-month premium and aged 30 next birthday at the time of
taking out a policy maturing on March 31, 1995. Over 10 years the payout
would be #10,799, a 5.7% decline on the #11,463 paid on March 31, 1994,
but still a return of 11.3% per annum against an average rate of
inflation of 4.9% over the period.
For a 25-year policy term the payout would be #101,386 against
#105,580 last year, a return of 13.1% per annum against inflation of
8.8%.
Scottish Mutual's chief executive Andrew Pople said: ''It is
encouraging that we have been able to maintain our reversionary bonus
despite current stock market conditions.
''While there has been a slight decrease in maturity values for
policies maturing on or after March 1, payouts on traditional policies
still represent excellent returns which, when viewed in the context of
low levels of inflation, are more than competitive with other forms of
personal savings.''

ONE of the three men accused of murdering a 63-year-old retired mining
engineer moments after a #185,000 bank robbery was only the getaway
driver, his defence counsel said yesterday.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, counsel for Mr Paul Bootland, told the jury in
the Bonnyrigg trial that he was making no attempt to conceal his
client's role in the crime.
''My position on behalf of Mr Bootland is that he was the driver of
the getaway car in this robbery and as such never left the getaway car
during the course of this robbery.''
Mr Bootland, 25, is alleged to have robbed the Bank of Scotland in
High Street, Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on October 19 last year with Mr
Robert Smith, 33, and Mr Gerald McQuade, 40.
The three deny murdering Mr David Dunn by shooting him in a car park
near the bank.
They are also accused of attempting to murder Police Constable John
Duffy and two other men, Mr John Girdler and Mr Duncan Milliken, by
presenting a loaded gun at them and repeatedly discharging it.
Mr Findlay made Mr Bootland's position clear as he questioned Mr Peter
Reid, 29, a financial consultant with the Bank of Scotland in Bonnyrigg.
Mr Reid said that as he drove past in his car on the day of robbery he
saw two men standing talking in the High Street.
He had a clear view of one man, who was about six feet tall with
short, dark hair and wearing a green nylon bomber jacket.
Asked if he could identify the man, he said he could not be sure but
the man resembled Mr Bootland.
He agreed with Mr Findlay that if it was the case that Mr Bootland was
the getaway driver and had never left the car, he might be mistaken
about having seen him in the street.
Earlier, a bank customer, Mr Donald McBride, of Moffat Avenue,
Bonnyrigg, told the court how he had been speaking to a teller when he
noticed ''a look of horror'' on her face.
He turned and saw a man pointing a gun in his face and another man
hustling a Securicor guard to the back of the bank. He was ordered to
lie on the floor and after the raiders left he walked out in a state of
shock.
Mr Kevin Addison, personal banking manager at the Bonnyrigg branch,
said he had been warned that he would be ''blasted'' if he moved.
The trial contiues.

A TEENAGE mother, her two children, and a friend's baby daughter, died
yesterday when flames swept through a house in Annan, Dumfriesshire.
Friends and neighbours tried to save them but were beaten back by
thick smoke and intense heat as the fire spread upstairs from the living
room of the terraced council house in Shawhill Court.
As a fire investigation team and police forensic experts sifted
through the charred wreckage of the house it emerged that the fire may
have started when clothes drying in front of a gas fire caught light.
The victims were named as Ms Elizabeth McPhillips, 17, her
19-month-old daughter Sarah and eight-month-old son John, and
six-month-old Sophie Reid who had been staying overnight.
Sophie's mother, Ms Sharon Reid, of the town's Westgill, escaped from
the fire with her son, Steffan, 2.
Ms Reid, who was treated for shock and the effects of smoke
inhalation, said last night: ''I had spent the night at Elizabeth's with
my two children and we were sleeping on a sofa in the living room.
Suddenly I was wakened by Steffan who had been lying on my knee. He was
choking and could hardly breathe.
''The room was on fire and there was smoke everywhere, I grabbed
Steffan and the next minute the flames were right through the house.''
Ms Reid continued: ''I shouted to neighbours there was a fire and
people were still in there then I tried to get back into the house
because I knew my baby and Elizabeth and her kids were trapped. I got so
far into the house but was beaten back by the flames which singed my
hair. There was nothing we could do, it was terrible.''
Ms Reid said smoke alarms were fitted in the house but she did not
hear them go off.
Immediate neighbour, Mr Jason Fairbairn, 20, got into the hallway of
the house and was approaching the living room when he heard a bang and
saw a fireball coming towards him.
The dairyman said: ''I could hear the lassie screaming for help but
there was nothing we could do.''
Senior officials of Annandale and Eskdale District Council expressed
their concern at the tragedy and stressed that smoke detectors are
fitted in all council properties.
A report is being prepared for the procurator-fiscal at Dumfries.

Ross Finlay road tests the BMW 316i Compact
ONE thing to beware of is the judgment occasionally seen in test
reports that some car or other could easily handle more power. To
somebody like myself who is quite happy with an excess of handling
capability over power output, it does not make much sense. Certainly,
engineers can work wonders in that line. The snag is that the process
usually involves stiffer suspension, deteriorated ride quality and a
clumsier feel through the steering.
One of the most powerful production saloons I have driven had
tremendous traction and could corner like nothing on earth. But you
simply could not leave it alone for an instant. There was no relaxation
in driving it, it jerked all over the place on any but billiard-table
surfaces, and it would ''tramline'' into any tarmac grooves. I hated it.
The car in question was not a BMW, but many critics applaud the most
powerful and most expensive of these Munich designs. However, I have
recently enjoyed a couple of the entry-level models, cars with no
pretensions about their flat-out performance.
As a result, they were pleasant and straightforward to drive, and they
put that covetable badge within the same price range as much more
mundane rivals. The 316i Compact comes at a showroom price of #13,350. I
drove one car on local roads, many of them with variable surfaces and up
in the hills. The other slogged 1000 miles or so to Gatwick and back.
The two-door Compact looks good, even if the purplish exterior of one
example was not entirely ''me''. There are definite cost-cutting
measures involved, not all of them visible. Interior trim materials are
obviously specified down to a price. The rear suspension is of an older
and simpler design than is fitted to the rest of the current 3-series
cars.
Its engine is simple too. The 316i uses a 1596cc eight-valve unit
which peaks at 102bhp. It will sprint to 60mph in a leisurely -- by BMW
standards -- 12 seconds, offers modest torque and flexibility, and will
reach a test track maximum around 116mph . Fuel returns are about 49mpg
at 56mph, 37 at 75 and 31mpg on the urban cycle.
The 316i Compact is not lavishly equipped. There are several
extra-cost option packs and individual items of equipment, but how much
sense would it make to buy a rock-bottom BMW model and then load it with
extras? While the standard driver's airbag means that the steering wheel
does not adjust for height, the driver's seat does. Normally, I do not
approve of that mixture, but it worked well enough this time. As so
often with German cars, I thought the wheel could have been a couple of
inches smaller.
Not having to worry about putting down vast amounts of power, this
Compact has top-class ride standards. On the other hand, I thought the
way the car cornered and handled generally was excellent too. Some of us
still like the rear-wheel drive layout which is not usual in this size
of car today. While it may lack the pin-point finesse in tight corners
which comes with the best FWD designs, that makes little difference to
people who are travelling at brisk but legal speeds.
The long motorway journeys showed that the Compact is a relaxed
cruiser, with low noise levels and, in the front cabin anyway, a
spacious feel. Some of the earliest examples of the present 3-series
cars were a let-down in build quality, to the extent that Munich seemed
to have started to drift into the old ''Friday afternoon at the
factory'' syndrome. There was none of that with either of the Compacts I
tried.
A haul up the M6 in snow and high winds made me relieved that even
this entry-level BMW comes with ABS as standard. In weather conditions
of the kind which often make driving miserable, the stability and sense
of being in a properly engineered car were pretty cheering.

NATIONAL Express is continuing its drive to become an integrated
transport group rather just a coach operator.
It is paying #7.1m for Bournemouth airport. National Express already
owns East Midlands airport, acquired for #27.1m in July 1993, and has
declared an interest in Birmingham and Cardiff airports.
The Bournemouth acquisition is expected to be marginally earnings
dilutive initially. This is because National Express intends to fund the
airport's development from internal resources. It sees the deal as a
chance to develop a profitable, well-sited regional airport.
The company running Bournemouth airport made a post-tax profit of
#79,000 in 1994. The airport handled about 160,000 passengers in the
nine months to December 31, which was a 50% rise over the same period in
1993. Bournemouth airport handles short-haul domestic and international
scheduled flights as well as charters.
National Express sees scope to develop the airport as an attractive
option to handle the overspill from other congested airports in
South-east England, notably Heathrow and Gatwick. In addition it hopes
to increase the airport's appeal as a significant charter and cargo
airport serving the large and growing south coast conurbations nearby.
Alongside its coach and airport interests, National Express is also
closely monitoring opportunities which may arise out of the
privatisation of British Rail. It makes commercial sense for the
company, Britain's largest inter-city coach company, to keep an eye on
rivals in the transport market.
Alastair Dick, the company's director of group planning, thinks it
would be theoretically possible to have a rail service within our
portfolio''. Mr Dick says that the company is a firm believer in ''the
advantages of integrated intermodal transport''.
News of its latest acquisition drove National Express shares up 9p to
319p.

A GLASGOW housing association has become the first to be criticised
for maladministration by the Housing Association Ombudsman for Scotland.
Mr John Richards has ruled that the Govanhill Housing Association was
incompetent and has recommended that a couple who complained to him
should be paid #500 compensation.
He upheld their complaint the association was wrong in freezing their
application to transfer to more suitable accommodation.
It had imposed a blanket ban on transfers because of vandalism in the
common back-court area adjoining their home and excluded the couple, who
are not named in the judgment, from a committee meeting which heard
their case.
Mr Richards said in his report, issued yesterday, that the couple were
unfairly stigmatised by an assumption that they had supported
anti-social behaviour.
He recommended his finding be reported to the association's management
committee.
The Ombudsman service for housing association tenants was set up last
year to investigate complaints from those who claim to have suffered
personal injustice as a result of bad, inefficient, or improper
administration.
Since last spring, 90 formal complaints have been received throughout
Scotland.
The couple, living in a three-bedroom ground floor flat, had
complained the association was wrong to freeze their application for
transfer in a situation which was unfair and unreasonable.
They had been accused in an open letter sent to them and neighbours of
supporting anti-social behaviour ''by association''.
The Ombudsman's finding was that the association's administration of
the ban was faulty in relation to widely accepted standards of good
practice and its own published procedures.

ECONOMISTS from the Scottish Agricultural College and Edinburgh
University have concluded that the public is confused in its attitudes
to organic food, the Prince of Wales will be told today during a visit
to the SAC's Sustainable Farming Systems Initiative at Craibstone
Estate, near Aberdeen.
A major study has found that in addition to public confusion there are
problems of low volume, inefficient distribution, slow turnover and high
wastage.
It suggests that given the right marketing strategies there are growth
opportunities in fruit, vegetables and new meat products. On-farm
processing may be possible for some producers, especially where there is
access to local or specialised markets.
The economists see any major expansion, however, coming in off-farm
processing for export and for supermarkets where the market could expand
to more than #100m.
For this market to take off, producers must be able to provide regular
supplies of quality produce, at the right price, properly certified,
labelled and packaged, said the study. ''Only then will they be able to
make some inroads on high raw material costs and retail prices which
impede growth in these sectors.''
The aim of sustainable farming is described as ''to develop food
production systems that sustain the rural environment with minimal
demand on non-renewable resources.''

Chemicals group BTP is raising #52m through a rights issue of new
shares to fund expansion. The group is making the cash call on terms of
one new share for every six already held at 225p each to pay for a
string of deals and provide funds for future acquisitions, ''which could
involve a total cost of approximately #30m.''
In the past two years, Manchester-based BTP bought struggling fellow
chemicals group MTM and six other smaller firms for #27m. BTP has just
bought a plant in Ruabon, north Wales, for #3.5m used for making key raw
materials for cosmetics and toiletries.
Funds from the cash call will eliminate net borrowings currently
standing at #49m.
On current prospects, chairman John Ketteley said: ''Trading has been
encouraging in a challenging environment. Progress has been made in
obtaining price increases necessitated by the rising cost of raw
materials.''

THE first licensing board in Scotland to impose a ban preventing the
drinking of bottled beers and cider ''from the neck'' in an effort to
reduce violence in bars and cut down litter on streets, has decided to
review its position.
Ettrick and Lauderdale District Licensing Board yesterday agreed to
relax the ban until October, following a meetingwith the licensed trade.
Borders licensees had pointed out the effects of the ban on profit
margins and the difficulties explaining the system to customers.
The ban was imposed two years ago and the board was advised that there
had been a drop in incidents on licensed premises and in the number of
bottles collected in the streets.
It will now monitor the position.

THE Scottish Office moved last night to clarify the basis on which
ScotRail would be privatised, as the row over the future of Motorail and
Fort William sleeper services in Scotland intensified at Westminster.
The attack was led by SNP parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing, who
demanded that the Government should explain exactly where it stood.
After the exchanges at the Scottish Grand Committee on Wednesday, she
called on Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro ''to give a clear
and unequivocal commitment that the railway lines discussed at
yesterday's committee will continue to operate and that a full, formal
consultation will take place.''
Mrs Ewing, MP for Moray, is concerned that the Government is
backtracking on the commitment apparently given by Sir Hector on
Wednesday, when he spoke of ''formal'' consultation on the future of
Motorail and the Fort William sleepers.
The SNP spokesperson said last night that Sir Hector regarded himself
as a man of honour, and must honour the commitment he had given, but the
Scottish Office last night gave its own version of events.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''The franchising director is
expected to publish the proposed passenger service requirement for
ScotRail in May. He has indicated that he does not intend to include the
Fort William and Carlisle sleeper services, nor Motorail, in the
proposed PSR.
''Following publication of the PSR, there will be a formal process of
consultation with the Rail Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland
and local authorities, before final decisions on the PSR are known. The
PSR provides a basis on which ScotRail will, in due course, be
franchised.
''The consultation process will be carried out by the franchising
director in accordance with guidance issued to him by the Secretary of
State for Transport, under the provisions of the Railways Act, 1993.
This is the process of consultation to which Ministers were referring
during debate in the Scottish Grand Committee on February 8.''
The spokesman added: ''In the meantime, any decision to withdraw
sleeper or Motorail services in advance of this consultation process
would be a commercial decision for British Rail.''
It was made clear that at a meeting with Liberal Democrat Charles
Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, and a delegation of interested
parties on Wednesday, Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton had undertaken to ''ask BR to consider maintaining
present services, at least until after the consultation process and
final decisions on the PSR had been taken.''
The Lib Dems yesterday called on Rail Regulator John Swift to enforce
the statutory requirement for consultation before services are cut. They
backed their call with an Early Day Motion noting assurances that formal
consultation will take place had been given by Ministers in the Scottish
Grand Committee on Wednesday.
Mr Kennedy said: ''The rail regulator must now intervene, using his
designated powers under the Railways Act, to instruct the franchise
director to re-include the Fort William and Carlisle sleeper services,
as well as Motorail, in the Passenger Service Requirements consultation
process.''
Meanwhile, more than 200 protesters thronged Fort William railway
station yesterday, and stopped traffic outside as part of the campaign
to save the Motorail and sleeper services to the town.
As the uncertainty continued over whether there is to be a temporary
reprieve for the services, people came from all over Lochaber to
demonstrate their opposition to the proposed cuts.
Pipers, a wind band, and dozens of placards greeted rail travellers to
and from Fort William. The demonstration then moved out to the main road
where cars were stopped and leaflets distributed, all with the full
co-operation of the police. The protesters then marched through the
town.
Later, Fort William councillor Iain MacDonald, said: ''This has been
our first piece of direct action and we could easily return to it unless
we can persuade the powers that be that our rail services must be
reprieved.
''I wouldn't rule out civil disobedience. They really must realise how
seriously we take this issue, and the damage the loss of the services
could do to our local economy.''
Dr Michael Foxley, councillor for Mallaig, Ardnamurchan and the Small
Isles, said: ''The turnout today demonstrates the depth of feeling
within the community about the threat to our rail services. There are
people here who have travelled down from Mallaig and Arisaig to give
their support. We will keep this campaign going because what is being
proposed is madness.''
In Inverness, the convener of Highland Regional Council, Mr Duncan
McPherson, called on Rail Franchise Director Roger Salmon to think again
about axing the services, as a result of the intervention of a Scottish
Office Minister earlier in the week.
Mr McPherson said that Mr Salmon was duty bound to honour the
guarantee given by Sir Hector in the Scottish Grand Committee debate.

GOOD temper and moderation are the characteristics of parliamentary
behaviour.' Now there's a claim. Why not just add that MPs are at all
times sober, chaste, clean, wise as Socrates, and honest as the cheque
is long? Bound to get a laugh.
The words were uttered, with every appearance of sincerity, by Betty
Boothroyd, Speaker of the Commons, and a woman who really ought to know
better. Each week the poor soul presides over the mother of septic tanks
with the jaunty air of one wearing asbestos gloves, lead shielding, and
nose plugs. Yet when obliged to sedate a member foaming like Cremola she
sounds as if she's lecturing primary one on road safety.
This column takes a view on parliamentary language. The real problem,
it seems to this spectator, is not that MPs are mindlessly abusive but
that they are forbidden ever to say what they really mean within the
chamber. Edinburgh's Nigel Griffiths calls a dolt a nitwit and the world
reacts as though he's just produced a steaming veal piece. The Prime
Minister labels the leader of the Opposition a dimwit and no-one guesses
that John has been spending too long in front of the mirror. Dimwit;
nitwit: outrageous.
Yet this is not how people talk. This is not how people think. This is
not, you can bet, what Griffiths and Major really meant. But lest they
want Betty to send them off to stand in a corner they must behave like
infants pretending they really don't know any bad words.
Small wonder, however, given such stout resistance to reality, that
MPs exposed to the outside world react like Forrest Gump on a bad day.
If there's a wrong thing to be said at the wrong time in the wrong
place, our parliamentarians are ready, willing, and incapable. It's the
way they're brought up: poor sods just don't know any better.
Step forward, then (but check that your shoelaces are tied and your
flies are done up) Steven Norris, the minister irresponsible for
transport in the great city of London. Mr Norris is a national treasure,
no doubt about it.
Who else but the man whose job it is to get the huddled masses to and
from work could publicly pour scorn on anyone stupid enough to use a bus
or a train? Who else but the man paid to ensure that there are buses and
trains in the first place could admit that they constitute an experience
so hideous no sane person would want to go near them?
Thus Norris, in praise of the internal combustion engine, to the
Commons inquiry into vehicle exhaust pollution: ''You have your own
company, your own temperature control, your own music, and you don't
have to put up with dreadful human beings sitting alongside you.''
(There follows a moment's silence while dreadful human beings
everywhere contemplate the tragedy of Steven Norris in his own company.)
But is this not a dimwit of the pure stock? Is not the average nit
actually blessed with more wit?
Most of us recognise public transport as a trial. The abiding question
of any stray visitor to London is how on earth anyone there puts up with
it. Mr Norris has now let slip the reasons for this calamity: it has to
do with men in chauffeur-driven cars with a bottomless contempt for the
electorate and neither use for nor interest in the transport
infrastructure unless it eases the limo on its way.
Isherwood got it wrong: Mr Norris doesn't change trains. Mr Norris and
his like don't care about trains, buses or any of the other things the
little people use to get around. Logically, if these people did know or
care they might have done something about the horrors that ensue when
you buy a ticket. If they did have any interest they would not be
dismembering the rail network or ploughing useless motorways through
irreplaceable woodlands.
But be fair: Mr Norris has thought hard about all of this, and
thinking, as his colleagues will doubtless tell you, is very like work.
As he informed the Commons committee: ''A sad misapprehension has been
created that what you need to solve pollution is to get central
government to spend a lot of money on a metro system.''
It stands to reason: who could expect the Government to spend fortunes
on trains when it is fully occupied spending fortunes on motorways like
the gorgeous and ever-expanding M25 in a sincere and carefully conceived
effort to reduce atmospheric poisons? Still, perhaps in the fine,
analytic brain of Mr Norris we discern the outlines of new Tory
thinking. Now we begin to understand the real obstacle to Britain's
recovery: it's the people, stupid,  dreadful human beings and their
ceaseless demands for schools and health care and jobs and a transport
system. Just abolish them and watch the good times roll. At least the
roads wouldn't be so damnably congested.

THE steadily increasing gap between rich and poor in Britain is at its
widest for 50 years, leaving millions of families marginalised, an
independent report has found.
The report, the result of a year-long study by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation, says social and economic reforms are needed. It calls for
tax cuts to be targeted at the lower paid.
Its findings will be seized on by Labour this morning. In a speech in
Edinburgh, Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown will promise a ''new
campaign'' against poverty and unemployment.
He will tell the National Local Government Forum Against Poverty that
rising poverty and unemployment are dividing Britain and making the
economy under-perform.
Mr Brown will say: ''Britain should be shocked and galvanised this
morning into action by the scale of poverty and unemployment in our
midst.''
However, he is not expected to endorse the report's call for tax cuts
for the low-paid.
Members of the Rowntree panel that compiled the study include Mr John
Monks, TUC general secretary, and Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general. Both served in a personal capacity.
The team was chaired by Sir Peter Barclay, former chairman of the
Government's Social Security Advisory Committee, who described widening
income inequality as the ''gravest public concern''.
The report warned that millions of families were being denied a stake
in Britain's future prosperity because of widening inequalities. This
trend, although not an international one, has been the case in the
majority of industrialised countries.
However, the report said the pace at which inequality increased in the
UK was faster than in any other country except New Zealand.
It warned: ''In many areas of the UK the living standards and life
opportunities of the poorest are simply unaccceptably low in a society
as rich as ours.
''The falling relative incomes of the poorest are a concern, whether
or not they reach or exceed a particular absolute standard of some years
ago.''
Contrary to popular belief, there has been no trickle-down of wealth.
In contrast to any previous post-war period, as many as the poorest 30%
have failed to benefit from economic growth, the study found.
Furthermore, the incomes of those dependent on social security
benefits have fallen further behind those of the working population
since the early 1980s. Launching the report, Mr Davies and Mr Monks
issued a joint call for more education and training to help the jobless.
Mr Monks said: ''Everyone knows the rich are getting richer and the
poor are getting poorer. It cannot be allowed to continue. Training and
education are the key to helping employees get fairer rewards, and
enabling those with no jobs to stand a better chance of getting out of
unemployment.''
Mr Davies said: ''We need a strategy which goes with the grain of
these global changes. But that needs to involve an even more intense
effort to upgrade our national skills base.''

<HEADLINE>Coal farm sales go ahead British Coal seen softening its stance against tenant farmers</HEADLINE>

EDINBURGH solicitors firm McClure Naismith Anderson &amp; Gardiner has
been appointed by British Coal to undertake the legal work in the
forthcoming sale of land and farms now considered surplus to
requirements.
In Scotland the bulk of the sale will comprise about 20,000 acres of
farmland. Tenant farmers who wish to bid for the properties they
currently occupy have until Friday of next week to register an interest.
Mr David Scobbie, who farms on British Coal land near Tillicoultry,
said yesterday that many of the farmers involved had felt frustrated at
the difficulty in pursuing their interest in purchase with British Coal.
Initial indications had been that no sales to tenant farmers would be
considered but that stance has now been softened. Farms which are
considered to have development potential will not be offered to tenants,
however, and will be marketed on a commercial basis.
British Coal have written to 45 tenants asking them to indicate if
they are interested in purchasing their holdings. So far 36 have
confirmed an interest. A further 14 have been informed that they will
not be eligible to purchase because their land is considered to have
development potential. It is understood the most likely development
would be housing.
In some cases British Coal might be willing to sell off parcels of
land for development but such a split up could affect the viability of
the remaining land as a farming unit.
Farmers who are displaced by the sale of land to a third party would
normally be liable to receive compensation under the terms of their
agricultural lease.
Perth-based chartered surveyor Bell-Ingram has begun a series of farm
visits and inspections which will allow them to arrive at prices for
individual properties.
Solicitor Alan Simpson, one of the partners in McClure Naismith's
Edinburgh office, said that the sale would be a major legal exercise.
''There will be many potential development sites being sold,'' he said.
''There will be many excellent opportunities for purchasers.''
British Coal has said it hope to see the selling process under way
next month and they are looking for completion by the spring of next
year.
* TENANT farmers on the Black Isle who are concerned at the cost of
going to arbitration over rent increases proposed by their landlord --
Scarborough-based Broadland Properties -- have derived little comfort
from Parliamentary answers given by the Scottish Office Agriculture
Minister, Sir Hector Monro.
In response to a series of questions put by Ross, Cromarty and Skye
Liberal-Democrat MP Charles Kennedy, Sir Hector indicated that it was a
matter for the farmers themselves how they wished to be represented at
arbitration hearings.
One farmer has complained that professional advice, legal
representation and arbitration fees had cost him #60,000 -- many times
the rent increase which was in dispute.
Mr Kennedy said: ''The Scottish Office has studiously avoided
answering my specific question as to what assessment they have made of
the costs involved and I will be returning to them on that issue.''
He pointed out that farm arbitrations now seemed to be skewed towards
the use of chartered surveyors and against the use of farmers,
auctioneers and valuers.

SERVICES on the flood-damaged Argyle rail line in Glasgow will not
return to normal until at least October, it was confirmed yesterday.
However, the delay is being utilised by Strathclyde Regional Council to
carry out a #2m upgrading of the devastated Glasgow Central low level
and Argyle Street stations.
More than #4m of damage was caused to the Argyle line in December when
the worst floods for many years surged through the tunnels, knocking out
signalling equipment and marooning two trains at Central low level. The
water, polluted with sewage and oil, was 12ft deep in some places.
Railtrack has confirmed the damage costs will not fall on the council.
However, Strathclyde's roads and transportation chairman Charles
Gordon said the council had drawn up plans for the #2m upgrading of
Central low level and Argyle Street stations prior to the flood.
He said it made sense to carry out these improvements while the
stations were closed for repairs to signalling and tracks.
The council will also be spending #75,000 on re-opening the high level
station platforms at Rutherglen which has been without a service
following closure of the low-level Argyle line.

STRATHCLYDE councillors have serious doubts about the funding of a
major Strathclyde rail project after being told that the estimated costs
had doubled.
Preliminary feasibility work on the CrossRail project, which would
link Glasgow north and south electric services, had originally brought a
ScotRail estimate of #38m.
But following transfer of the railway infrastructure to Railtrack as
part of the Government's privatisation legislation, the estimate has
doubled to almost #77m.
Councillor Charles Gordon, the region's roads and transport chairman,
said this put a question mark over the ability of the future passenger
transport authority to fund the project.
He declared: ''It is unprecedented for a local authority to be told
that the estimate it had been given before enactment of the Railways Act
in April 1994 has now doubled.
''We just don't go and get more money. The amount we are allowed to
borrow is controlled by the Government. Even if they double the
borrowing consent for this project, we would be faced with the revenue
impact of double the loan charges.''
Councillor Gordon warned that the ''chickens were now coming home to
roost'' in terms of an unfolding piece of legislation that the
Government was trying to redefine and re-interpret on a daily basis.
''Every time they address one problem, another one springs up. It's a
shambles,'' he said.
Meanwhile Strathclyde region is maintaining its threat to withhold
around #1m in payments to ScotRail unless it is compensated for loss of
services during last year's signalmen's strike.
ScotRail and Railtrack are locked in a contractual dispute over the
issue, but Strathclyde feels it has a moral claim to compensation in
respect of the services it subsidises.

FOUR sites in Lothian where a roll-on/roll-off ferry terminal could be
established to connect Scotland with mainland Europe have been
identified in a feasibility study.
The sites are at Leith Docks (where capital costs would be #7m), the
Musselburgh/ Prestongrange area at Prestonpans (#33m), Cockenzie Power
Station (#38m), and Skateraw, near Torness Power Station, (#72m).
The study, details of which were released yesterday in Edinburgh, was
conducted by Halcrow Fox, consultants, for four sponsors -- Lothian
Regional Council, Edinburgh District, East Lothian District, and Lothian
and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (LEEL).
Councillor Keith Geddes, leader of Lothian Regional Council, said all
the sites had strengths and weaknesses.
The study results would now be examined and a further report would be
made in due course, he added.
Councillor George Wanless, chairman of East Lothian District Council,
said a ferry terminal would provide a boost to the Scottish economy and
particularly to tourism.
All four sites could be eligible for financial assistance from the
European Union.
Leith would have the lowest development cost but the journey time
could limit the frequency of service.
Musselburgh/ Prestongrange and Cockenzie would each require new
breakwaters and a dredged shipping channel.
Skateraw would need extensive engineering works, including two
breakwaters of up to half a mile long.

Cindy Crawford is to put more pep into Pepsi's promo. But, before
advertisers think they can now settle back and live life to the max,
Deedee Cuddihy conducts a test that could have them fizzing.
PICTURE the scene: you're at the shops and notice some cans of cola
going cheap at 25p each. ''Aha'', you say to yourself, ''this will do
for that sullen-faced, teenage toe-rag who was skulking in his room, as
usual, hunched over a computer game when he heard me going out the door
and yelled 'Get me a Coke!'''
Laden like a pack horse, you trudge home and are unloading the
messages on to the kitchen counter when Mr Nasty shuffles through and
asks if you need any help.
No, that last part is a joke. Of course your son doesn't offer to
help. Instead he says, ''Did you get me a Coke?'' and when you point to
the cans (they were such a bargain you had to get 12) which are printed
with phrases like, ''genuine American taste'', he shrieks, ''That's not
Coke!'' and retreats in a huff, to his bedroom -- slamming as many doors
as possible on the way.
I'm sure that little scene would have gladdened the heart of the
Coca-Cola Company (whose registered trademarks by the way include the
word Coke as well as the hyphen between the Coca and the Cola, who have,
after all, been telling us for years that Coke is ''The Real Thing''.
Many people, parents in particular, claim that there is no appreciable
difference in taste between the dozen or so cola drinks that can
currently be bought at retail outlets across the country.
Our teenagers' insistence on expensive brand names, they argue, just
demonstrates how they have been ''got at'' by manufacturers who spend
millions on clever advertising campaigns (note, however, that the very
people who insist that a Coke is just a cola may refuse to drink any
instant coffee other than Nescafe, on the grounds that cheaper makes,
whether they've tried them or not, are inferior).
But is Coca-Cola popular simply because of the way it has been
promoted? The product has, after all, been around since 1886, it's the
best-selling fizzy drink in the UK where #400m worth is consumed
annually and is also our number one best-selling grocery brand (Nescafe,
the world's first instant coffee, launched over 50 years ago, comes in
at number four).
Pepsi, with sales here totalling less than half of Coca-Cola's, is
Britain's second most popular soft drink. The two companies have
reportedly been at loggerheads for almost a century, ever since Mr Caleb
Bradham, also (like the creator of Coke) a pharmacist from the southern
states of America, decided to make his own cola some 12 years after the
invention of the original.
Despite massive sales and world-wide recognition, Pepsi and Coke have
been considerably shaken up by the recent appearance in Britain of
several rival American-style colas. Pepsi, in particular, has been so
disturbed by developments in the UK that the company decided to hold
last month's international press preview of its forthcoming advertising
campaign in London, rather than the United States.
The ads, which will start appearing next month, star super-model Cindy
Crawford and are what the trade call ''comparative in style''. This
means that, rather than merely alluding to rival brands (''You're not
going to make him drink that stuff, are you?'' asks the waitress in an
old Pepsi ad, referring to an unnamed cola), actors will be shown
holding bottles of Coke and viewers will be given the impression that
while Coke may be the preferred beverage of dreary, boring slobs, people
who want a bit of glamour in their lives drink Pepsi.
Coca-Cola has responded by helping to fund a commercial laboratory on
the US space shuttle Discovery. It's been reported that the astronauts
are going to help them in their search for a longer-lasting fizz.
Back on earth, however, there are more mundane matters to attend to
like organising a cola taste test for The Herald with a group of four
secondary school pupils and an equal number of, allegedly less
discerning, primary school kids.
Six brands of cola were on trial: Pepsi, Safeway Regular Select Cola,
Pepsi Max, Coca-Cola, Solripe American Cola, and Virgin Cola with prices
ranging from 38p a can to 20p (for the Solripe).
The questions asked were: Which cola do you like best? and Can you
name them?
Our secondary school testers were Bruni, Ossian, Ambika, and Tom.
Before the test, Bruni said she preferred Pepsi Max; Ambika, Coca-Cola;
Ossian, Pepsi Max -- or Irn Bru, and Tom, Coca-Cola. All said they had
seen adverts for cola but claimed not to have been influenced by them.
First into the paper cups was Brand A, the Pepsi which two testers
guessed was Virgin and all thought a trifle flat. Three testers thought
that Brand B was the Safeway cola and they were right, they all liked
it.
Everyone guessed, correctly, that Brand C was Pepsi Max (which is
artificially sweetened) and it was given the thumbs-up by Bruni and
Ossian who drink it regularly.
Three testers thought that Brand D was the Coke, which it was,
although Tom who drinks at least one a day, wasn't sure.
However, he correctly guessed that Brand E was the Solripe cola and
pronounced it ''totally sad''. The other three thought it was Pepsi and
didn't like it either.
Brand F was the Virgin cola which three testers said was Solripe and
Tom thought was Pepsi. None was impressed.
Overall, the Safeway Regular Select Cola was liked the best and
Solripe American cola the least.
Afterwards, Tom and Ossian said they might be tempted to switch to the
Safeway brand (25p a can) if it was more widely available, while Ambika
and Bruni said they would stick to, respectively, Coke and Pepsi Max.
Next, the primary school testers, Rosie, Lia, Laurie, and Mandela who
all said they enjoyed fizzy drinks and didn't care what brand they were.
All four liked Brand A (Pepsi) and thought it might be Virgin cola.
Brand B (Safeway) was also appreciated but the next Pepsi Max was
described variously as ''sickly'' and ''disgusting''. Nobody guessed
that Brand D was the Coke although it was fairly well-received but all
of the children correctly identified the Solripe which they pronounced
''weird'' and not really like cola but not bad. The Virgin cola was also
quite acceptable.
So, the primary school testers also gave Safeway Regular Select Cola
top marks but were least impressed by Pepsi Max.
Draw your own conclusions -- before you see the Cindy Crawford ads of
course.

Margaret Vaughan reports that despite Government claims that public
sector pay has moved ahead of the private sector the exact opposite
appears to be the case
NOW there are lies, damned lies and statistical quirks. The figures
given by Ministers as proof that public sector workers have moved ahead
of the private sector in the pay stakes do not stand up to scrutiny.
If you were to rely on the evidence, it would look as if average
earnings in the private sector were five pounds a week behind wages in
the public sector. For the figures, extracted from the Government's own
New Earnings Survey, give average gross weekly earnings in the UK public
sector of #329.30 compared with #324.20 in the private sector.
However, independent pay analysts Income Data Services say the figures
are misleading. They discovered the reverse to be true. Public sector
wage rates still lag behind earnings in the private sector.
The discrepancy arises because the public sector now has a much lower
proportion of manual workers. Since the advent of privatisation and
contracting-out, there are far fewer manual workers in the public
sector. The private sector figures, meanwhile, includes a huge number of
manual workers.
''This means the bald comparison is entirely misleading,'' said
analyst David Shephard, ''because you are not comparing like with like .
. . It is in fact a statistical quirk.''
Wage rises paid by private employers have continued to surge ahead of
those in the public sector which have been held down by the Treasury's
determination to rein in the pay bill for the UK's 5.5m public sector
workers.
There is no separate public and private sector breakdown for Scotland
where weekly earnings are lower than average at #335 a week for men and
#244 for women.
The independent analysts found that in 1993, when there was a 1.5% pay
rise limit in the public sector, workers in the private sector moved
ahead with increases of between 2% and 4%.
In 1994, most of the public sector settlements were around the rate of
inflation, averaging out at 2.5%. By the final quarter of last year, two
thirds of private sector pay awards were 3% or more.
For example, at the Nissan plant workers received a 4% wage rise in a
two-year deal. Five thousand workers in the flat glass industry gained
an annual increase of 3%. Three thousand non-management staff at British
Airways got a 3.6% rise.
Last year, London-based Labour Research -- which is not connected with
the Labour Party -- compiled evidence on a breakdown of pay rates in
both sectors.
It drew on unpublished figures compiled for the New Earnings Survey to
show that in all but 10 out of 25 job categories, pay rates in the
private sector were ahead of public sector wages.
Senior managers in the private sector earned on average #80 a week
more than their counterparts in the public services. Science and
engineering professionals working in private companies earned #461 a
week, compared with those in the public sector whose average was #448.
The lowest paid workers, classified as working in ''elementary''
occupations such as porters, kitchen hands, catering assistants,
cleaners and domestics, were, however, better off in the public than in
the private sector. Men in the private sector earned #27 a week less
than those in the public sector, whose wage packet was on average #252 a
week.
Women, in a not uncommon finding, earned least of all in these jobs,
but were paid substantially more in the public than in the private
sector, at #177 a week compared with #148 in private employment.
In its analysis of public service pay, published this week, Income
Data Services say that the Government's pay policies have been the main
factor slowing the rate of growth of earnings in the public sector,
relative to the private sector.
Over the 12 months to April 1994, average earnings for all employees
in the public sector rose by 2.6%, compared with 2.8% in private firms.
In the previous few surveys, the report said, it had been the public
sector which had the faster growth.
For men, the difference between public and private sector growth in
wages between 1993 and 1994 was more marked. The average weekly earnings
of men in the public sector grew by just 1.4%, against a rise of 2.8% in
the private sector. The slowest rise in pay was for manual men in the
public sector -- a rise of just 0.9% compared with 2.7% in the private
sector.
For women, the picture was again different. Slightly faster earnings
growth was shown in the public sector in the year to April 1994, of 3.7%
against 3.4% in the private sector.
The 1994 New Earnings Survey figures do not allow for direct
comparisons between wages in the two sectors. But, arguably perhaps, a
broad comparison can be drawn by looking at average wage rates for
business and financial professionals, who earned an average of #513 a
week, against teachers whose earnings were #427.
Computer analysts and programmers were on an average #439 a week,
against associate health professionals, such as nurses, on #320 a week.
While administrative and clerical officers in the Civil Service and
local government were earning an average of #223 a week, secretaries and
personal assistants and typists averaged #246 a week.
Mr Chris Trinder, of the independent Public Finance Foundation -- part
of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy -- has
warned that rapid rises in private sector pay have a knock-on effect on
future public sector pay awards.
He claims his research has proved that public service pay is largely
determined by earlier developments in the private sector. The lags are
often long and also variable, anything between nine months to three
years, but in the long run current private sector pay increases were the
single most important determinant of future central and local government
pay levels.
The significance of this, he argues, is that although the government
may announce public sector pay restraint and implement it for a period,
if pay in other parts of the economy continues to rise at a much faster
rate then, to recruit, retain and motivate people of appropriate quality
for the public services it is necessary to raise those wage rates too.
As the political row brews over the extent of job losses needed to
finance the public pay rises without breaching the freeze on the pay
bill, Mr Trinder has pointed out that every 1% rise in public sector
earnings means the loss of about 50,000 public sector jobs.
The Red Book, issued with the Chancellor's Budget, said central
government departments were expected to offset, or more than offset, pay
and price increases through efficiencies and other economies.
City analysts have said it will be difficult to fund the rise in the
pay bill from productivity increases. The CBI, which has urged that the
public sector should copy the private sector shift to decentralised
bargaining and pay flexibility, warned last year that freezing the
public sector pay bill would lead to job losses.
It argues this will not increase unemployment, provided the private
sector can expand to absorb the public sector jobs.
Last night, union leaders and local authorities, who have to fund pay
increases out of existing grants, also warned that jobs were at risk. In
Lothian, for example, the region will have to pay out an extra #3m just
to fund a deal negotiated with teachers last year to cover rises in the
cost of living.

THE freezing temperatures of space forced British astronaut Dr Michael
Foale and another shuttle crewman to cut short a spacewalk and abandon a
demonstration of high-flying weightlifting yesterday.
Earlier the shuttle Discovery plucked a one-and-a-quarter-ton science
satellite from orbit that the two men were to have used as a hi-tech
barbell.
Lincolnshire-born Dr Foale, 38, emigrated to the US in 1982 to become
an astronaut.
His mother and father watched proudly on TV in Britain today as their
son, who as a little boy jumped off sofas at home, pretending to be a
spaceman, achieved a lifelong dream.
The 250-mile-high spacewalk by Cambridge-educated Dr Foale and Bernard
Harris was the third and final major task of the joint US and Russian
shuttle mission which was launched from Florida six days ago.
A rendezvous with Russia's Mir space station and the later retrieval
of the science satellite using Discovery's robot arm were the two other
major goals of the eight-day mission which is set to end on Saturday.
The two astronauts floated through a tunnel into Discovery's cargo bay
at 12.10 GMT.
As they emerged far above the Indian Ocean, Dr Foale joked: ''Golly,
it's high isn't it?''
''Don't look down,'' answered Mr Harris.
They had been exposed to temperatures as low as minus 135 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 92C) for almost three hours when Nasa ground
controllers called an early halt to the spacewalk.
Dr Foale had earlier complained of chills.
''I can't do work with my hands like this,'' he said at one point.
The duo went outside to test space station construction techniques and
improvements to their spacesuits -- including thicker gloves and
undergarments -- which were intended to keep them warm.
One of the objectives of the exercise was to see just how cold the
crewmen would get, Nasa said.
''Looks like we put you in the deep freeze today,'' said the shuttle
pilot Eileen Collins, who choreographed the spacewalk from inside the
spacecraft.
''It was like putting my fingers in that liquid nitrogen freezer we
have at Nasa,'' Dr Foale said.
The re-usable satellite, called Spartan, was to have doubled up as an
exercise ball for the astronauts, who planned to lift and move it around
in the cargo bay in a demonstration of techniques for handling massive
objects in the absence of gravity.
Mr Harris had managed to lift and hold the satellite for an extended
period before the demonstration was interrupted.
Spartan had flown as far as 50 miles from Discovery for two days,
using a small telescope to observe the interstellar medium -- the gas
and dust between the stars and planets.
The shuttle scooped it up to bring it back to Earth so that scientists
can analyse the data recorded during its short flight.

Washington, Thursday
THE man alleged to have been the mastermind behind the World Trade
Center bombing, which killed six people and wounded over 1000 in
February 1993, has pleaded not guilty.
Iraqi Ramzi Ahmed Yousef was arrested in Pakistan on Tuesday and taken
to New York.
He was reportedly the leader of a group of terrorists from the Middle
East who plotted to assassinate the Pope in the Philippines last month.
His alleged accomplices were arrested, but he managed to escape to
Pakistan.
He first arrived in the US from Pakistan in September 1992, on the
same flight as one of the men later convicted of taking part in the
bombing, Ahmad Ajaj.
Ajaj was arrested at the airport and was found to have bomb-making
manuals.
The case against Yousef will go before Judge Duffy who presided in the
earlier trial. Another hearing is set for next Wednesday.

SCALING back of claims under the 1994 Beef Special Premium Scheme will
be at a significantly lower level than in 1993, Sir Hector Monro, the
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, said yesterday. Payments to
Scottish farmers will total #31m compared to #25m in 1993.
Latest figures indicate that claims for some 315,000 animals were made
against a regional ceiling of 244,748 for Scotland. Each producer's
claim will be reduced by 22.3%. The premium payment itself is increased
from #56.34 to #69.07.

BONN: The European Union yesterday told Germany it must uphold EU law
and end a boycott of British beef. Some German states have halted beef
imports over fears of ''mad-cow disease''. The Bonn government agreed to
allow imports of some British beef from last Monday after the EU ruled
that British cattle born after 1992 were safe. But meat processors,
distributors, and retailers in several west German states agreed
voluntary boycotts this week with the support of local governments. EU
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said the EU might turn to the
courts if Bonn did not act soon.

PEREIRA: Rescuers using their bare hands searched through rubble
yesterday for survivors of an earthquake which wrecked the Colombian
city of Pereira, killing at least 38 people and injuring more than 230.
The quake, the country's deadliest tremor in over a decade, shook a wide
area, toppling some tall buildings, opening huge cracks in others, and
sending people running into the streets in panic.
It lasted about 40 seconds, measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, and had
its epicentre about 130 miles from the capital Bogota. Shock waves were
felt in Bogota but most of the death and destruction was concentrated 90
miles away in Pereira, an industrial city of 300,000 in the heart of the
Colombian coffee belt. Officials warned the death toll was likely to
rise.

Dallas, Thursday
ALLEGATIONS that Mark Thatcher was part of a conspiracy, which is said
to have defrauded a Houston businessman of his company, were denied
today.
Mark Thatcher, businessman David Wallace, and their Dallas law firm of
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld were named as defendants in a
lawsuit by John Laughlin, the former owner of Ameristar Fuels, a Houston
jet fuel company.
The managing partner of Thatcher's law firm, Edward Copley, said
neither the firm nor its clients had any liablity. ''This is a dispute,
basically, between shareholders of a corporation,'' he said. ''We
represented two of those shareholders (Thatcher and Wallace), and the
other party has chosen now to sue the lawyers as well as the parties.''
* Cuban exiles have named a school after Lady Thatcher at a university
planned for a free Havana. Lady Thatcher was speaking at a meeting of
the Cuban American National Foundation today in Florida, which announced
the planned university would include a Margaret Thatcher School of
Democratic Government.

while prevailing winds and currents carried him west. The flying
instructor admits he swam well under half the distance and normally
travelled slower when swimming than resting on his raft. He was harassed
by sharks and plagued by equipment failures.

THERE were no record prizes yesterday on the concluding day of the
Perth Bull Sales. However, Charolais sires sold well all day recording
no less than five bids of 10,000gns or more.
Heading the way at 13,000gns was the fifth prize July 1993 Lochnagar
Imperator by Brampton Chopper from John Irvine, Inverlochy, Tomintoul,
Banffshire. Mr Irvine astutely bought this bull last October for just
3000gns. The buyer this time was Will Oates, Ouston Farms, County
Durham.
Another one to miss out on the top show prizes was the second prize
October 1993 Derrygiff Influenze -- again by Chopper -- from Ken Brady,
Derrydiff, Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, which sold at 11,000gns to
Cliff Hopwood, Clock Farm, Grimston, York. This was Mr Brady's first
visit to Perth from his 110-acre farm where he runs 30 cows.
Three bulls fetched 10,000gns with the first coming from Maerdy herd
of Welsh vet and farmer Esmor Evans of Monfa, Mold, Clwyd, who brought
no less than 35 bulls to Perth. His 10,000gns sire was the reserve
senior champion, the June 1993 Maerdy Ian by Maerdy Gentleman, which
sold to Peter Donger, Seawell, Towcester, Northants.
Minutes earlier Mr Evans had sold his senior champion Maerdy Illinois
by the home-bred United to G &amp; M Porter, Carrabus, Bridgend, Islay, at
6200gns, but he bettered that later selling again at 10,000gns for the
first prize July 1993 Maerdy Influence by Maerdy Forum. Taking this one
was the leading Suffolk sheep breeder, Jimmy Wilson, Barnyards, Mintlaw,
Aberdeenshire, acting jointly with Airdlin Farming Partnership, Ellon.
The final five-figure bid came when Scotland's top dairy farmer Dean
Anderson, Mayne, Elgin, went to 10,000gns to secure the third prize
September 1993 Heywood Imperial -- again by Chopper -- from Steve Ling,
Heywood, Wellington, Somerset. In turn, Mr Ling paid 7000gns for the
intermediate and reserve overall champion, the September 1993 Thornham
Interceptor by Balmyle Champion from Geoff Eggleston, Thornham Hill,
Newcastle-on-Tyne.
The money kept circulating when John Irvine invested some of his
profit, paying 9000gns for the reserve junior champion, the October 1993
Thrunton Impeccable by the 30,000gns Moncur General from Colin Campbell
&amp; Sons, Thrunton, Morpeth.
Also selling at 9000gns was the breeder of Chopper Billy Turner,
Linghams, Ripon. He sold the unplaced April 1993 Brampton Invoice by
Chopper to near-neighbour Michael Atkinson, Mowbray Park, Ripon. Two
leading Perthshire breeders, Bill Bruce, Drumkilbow, Meigle, and David
Walter, Balthayock, Perth, teamed up for what they described as ''a real
bargain'' to get the second prize Maerdy Iliad at 8000gns.
The commercial trade was topped by two sales at 7500gns. The first
came when Jim Goldie, Townfoot, Dumfries, sold de Crispigny Illustrious
to Robert Weir, Townfoot, Thornhill. Scott Rodger, Muirhouse, Stow, paid
a similar price to buy the first prize Maerdy Idea. Maerdy also sold at
7000gns when Scottish Livestock Services, through its director Jack
Lawson, took Islam for the AI station at Scone.
Two leading south-west of Scotland farming companies maintained their
practice of sharing a top bull when Blackwood Farms, Auldgirth, and
Glenapp Estates, Ballantrae, paid Jim Goldie 7000gns for Goldies
Intimate. From the same district, Gelston Castle Farms, Castle Douglas,
sold their first prize winner, Kelton Impresario to the recently founded
pedigree herd of Mrs Glenda Tillbrook, Woodrow Farm, Amersham, Bucks.
The overall and junior champion, Bassingbourn Impact from Mr and Mrs M
Parker, Grange, Duxford, Cambridge, made the relatively modest price of
5000gns to W Johnson, North Milbrex, Fyvie, Aberdeenshire, while the
reserve intermediate champion, Fairway Impression from David Fattorini,
Skewkirk Hall, York, sold at 6500gns to W Gubbins &amp; Sons, Penhole,
Launceston, Cornwall.
At the conclusion of the sale Esmor Evans was the happiest man in
Perth having sold 26 bulls through the ring to gross #132,405 for the
great average of #5092.
The Charolais breed secretary summed up the sale: ''It's been a very
solid trade without any real top prices.'' Overall 263 bulls average
#3591 -- down #206 on 1994 when 230 were sold. During four days of
trading in Perth 711 head were sold to gross #2,063,588 for an average
of #2878. Auctioneers: United Auctions Limited.

Gaza Strip, Thursday
PEACE talks between Israel and the PLO slid deeper into crisis today
after Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat failed to break a deadlock over
security and an Israeli ban on Palestinians.
Prime Minister Rabin and the PLO leader agreed to meet again in one
week's time to give officials time to try to resolve differences over
extending Palestinian self-rule to the occupied West Bank.
Rabin played down talk of a crisis in implementing the long-stalled
self-rule deal. But Yasser Abed Rabbo, Arafat's information chief, said:
''I think there is a crisis, a real crisis. There are two tendencies and
two approaches.''
The two-hour meeting at the Israeli-Gaza Strip border ended without an
expected joint news conference. Instead, a stern-faced Arafat walked
head down to his car to go to a meeting with a visting EU delegation led
by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.
Since the start of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho last May, the two
sides have gone from meeting to meeting in Cairo, Gaza, and elsewhere
with little progress on such key issues as Palestinian elections and
Israeli troop redeployment.
An unprecedented four-way Arab-Israeli summit in Cairo last week was
aimed at jump-starting the talks. That meeting also broke up without an
expected news conference.
Today, Juppe and delegates from Germany and Spain said the Middle East
peace process was at a critical stage.
''A break in the peace process would have catastrophic consequences
for the whole region and for international stability,'' Juppe said.
Both Rabin and Arafat have staked their political futures on
implementing their 17-month-old peace agreement, but they have run up
against obstacles at every step.
Today, Rabin said: ''There were differences but by no means will I
describe this as a crisis. We decided in the light of the fact it wasn't
possible from the standpoint of time and other circumstances to reach
solutions today to hold another discussion next week,'' he said.
But he insisted an 18-day-old ban on Palestinians entering Israel from
the Gaza Strip and West Bank would remain in force. The closure was
imposed after two Gaza suicide bombers killed 21 Israelis in Israel last
month.
Rabin added that Arafat must take control of law enforcement. ''From
our standpoint, the main dominant consideration is the matter of
security,'' he said.
Arafat has voiced anger at the slow pace of expanding self-rule beyond
Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho.
''The meeting did not reach any results and the reason is that there
are differences over the main subjects of discussions,'' Abed Rabbo
said.
For the Palestinians, the key issues are troop redeployment, Jewish
settlements, and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Arafat's
supporters said the closure, which has stopped 60,000 Palestinian
labourers going to work in Israel, only erodes support for peace moves
and gives momentum to Islamic opponents. Half of Gaza is unemployed even
when Israel lets Palestinians in.
Meanwhile in the United States today, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres said the PLO must gain the upper hand against Muslim militants
before Palestinian self-rule can be expanded.
Speaking in Atlanta, Peres said Arafat was capable of meeting Israeli
demands that he controlled Gaza-based members of Hamas and Islamic
Jihad, which both oppose the peace process between Israel and the PLO.
''It is either he will control them or they will control him. I hope
he will be able to establish his authority,'' he said.
In Jordan, King Hussein today toured the last of the land returned to
his country by Israel under their peace treaty, expressing optimism
about Jordan's future under peace.
''I am very hopeful of the period ahead, a period of consolidation,''
he said, emphasising the Israeli-Jordanian peace was negotiated without
outside involvement.
''The possibilities are limitless. We faced up to our responsibilities
and we hope that the others will do the same. I hope they will achieve
what we have achieved and we will all have peace in the region.''
Earlier, officials from the two sides initialled accords on border
crossings, tourism, and security on the Israeli side of the Jordan
River. The accords were the first in a series covering everything from
trade to border demarcation to be signed by June.--Reuter

Sarajevo, Thursday
BOSNIAN Serbs launched a mortar barrage at government army positions
in Sarajevo today, blasting apart a truce that has held since New Year's
Day.
Machinegun fire was heard after explosions hit an area near the
Bosnian capital's Jewish cemetery. The frontline separating the mainly
Muslim government army and the Bosnian Serbs runs through the cemetery.
''There were eight explosions in the vicinity of the Jewish cemetery
from the Bosnian Serb army side. Now everything is quiet,'' said a UN
spokeswoman.
In Zagreb, a UN spokesman said the Serbs opened fire because the
government troops had dug trenches in violation of the truce.
The Bosnian Serbs have been besieging Sarajevo for more than 1000
days, during which time hundreds of civilians have been killed by sniper
fire and shelling.
Meanwhile, a UN convoy with food and medicine reached the besieged
city of Bihac today.--Reuter/AP

Los Angeles, Thursday
THE first policeman to arrive at the spot where O J Simpson's ex-wife
and her friend were murdered today gave graphic evidence of their
blood-soaked bodies and of bloody footprints leaving the scene.
Robert Riske told Simpson's double murder trial in Los Angeles that he
saw ''a female, white, in a black, black dress, lying in a puddle of
blood on the walkway.'' He identified the body as that of Nicole Brown
Simpson. A pool of blood under her flowed down towards the sidewalk.
Riske said one of 25-year-old Ronald Goldman's eyes was still open. He
prodded the eyeball to see if he could get any reaction but he was dead.
Photographs of the bodies were displayed on a large screen for the
jury who saw Nicole Simpson curled at the bottom of steps, her head a
mass of blood partially covered by blood-matted blonde hair, and her
bare legs smeared in blood.
Goldman was resting against a fence, his blood-covered shirt pulled
partially over his head, and his jeans soaked in more blood.
Simpson, an American footballer turned film actor, has denied stabbing
his ex-wife and Goldman to death.
Riske said he saw a trail of bloody footprints leading from the
pavement outside Nicole Simpson's home towards the front door and then
along an alleyway along the side of the house.--Reuter

<TEXT>
A SOLICITOR who reported two partners in her firm to the Law Society
for alleged overcharging received a #100,000 pay-off when she left the
practice, Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told yesterday.
Mrs Gaenor Stuart-Murray was given the money and a ''glowing''
reference when she left Robin Thompson and Partners, of Castle Street,
Edinburgh.
She admitted that she was advised to ask for #250,000, and told not to
sign a document which allowed the other members of the firm to continue
in partnership until she got what she wanted.
Two partners in her former firm are on trial charged with fraud.
Mr David Stevenson, 43, and Mr Lawrence Lumsden, 38, both deny
overcharging solicitors when sending out accounts of expenses after
winning cases.
The charge against them alleges that they overcharged for things such
as advocates' fees and expert witnesses' expenses a total of 13 times
between December 1985 and May 1992, and gained a total of #2673.09 for
their firm.
Cross-examined yesterday by Mr Gordon Jackson, QC, for Mr Lumsden, Mrs
Stuart-Murray denied going to the Law Society with her complaints of
overcharging as an ''act of sheer vindictiveness''.
She accepted that her relationship with her colleagues deteriorated
when she continued to make her allegations of overcharging.
When Mr Jackson suggested it was too much of a coincidence that she
went to the Law Society on the very day she was fired, she claimed that
she was always going to report the matter.
Mrs Stuart-Murray, from Kelso, came to work in Edinburgh from one of
Robin Thomson and Partners associated firms in England, in which she was
a partner.
She told the trial earlier that she checked a bill which had been sent
out and found that an amount stated for advocate's fees was more than
Robin Thompson and Partners had paid the advocate in the first place.
She told Mr Jackson that she was not satisfied with a review carried
out by one of the English partners after she took her allegations to
London.
Mr Jackson pointed out that Scottish senior counsel's opinion was that
the firm's methods of charging may not have been strictly proper, but
were widespread and not thought of as professional misconduct, far less
illegal.
In any event, said Mr Jackson, some of the billing practices were
stopped after Mrs Stuart-Murray raised the matter.
After leaving the firm, in early 1992, Mrs Stuart-Murray sued the
English partners.
She accepted that if she had not signed a form allowing the
partnership to continue after her departure it would have dissolved,
costing the firm a fortune in tax.
The threat not to sign was the background to her pay-off, and to the
good reference which Mr Jackson claimed was effectively dictated to
Robin Thompson and Partners by her solicitors.
The trial continues.

Grozny, Thursday
CHECHEN fighters scaled down their forces in the capital Grozny today,
virtually surrendering control to Russian troops after a six-week battle
in which hundreds of people died.
But Chechen commander Aslan Maskhadov vowed to fight on against the
Russians who moved into mainly-Muslim Chechnya last December to crush
its bid for independence.
''What's so special about one city?'' he said. ''The main thing is
that people are getting used to this war. They are becoming disciplined.
Soon it will be warm and we can fight in the mountains for 12 years.''
In Moscow, the chief of the Russian general staff, Mikhail Kolesnikov,
said he thought organised Chechen resistance was now virtually over and
that breakaway leader Dzhokhar Dudayev would be ''destroyed''.
The Chechens and outgunned and outnumbered, and on Wednesday said they
were moving their headquarters out of the shattered city to continue the
fight elsewhere.
Since they launched a New Year's Eve offensive, Russian troops have
rained shells down on the city and bombed it from the air. The hundreds
thought to have been killed have included many ethnic Russian civilians
who found themselves trapped in the city. Some reports say the death
toll may run into thousands.
Moscow's forces need only to advance about a mile from the north in
order to cut off the lone road into the city, and their inevitable
encirclement of Grozny will be complete.
Although the Chechens have dramatically thinned out they say some
fighters will stay behind to harass Russian troops.
Chechen fighters were defiant even as they pulled out.
Adam Baizatov, 51, said: ''Moscow fell three times and it did not mean
the end of Russia. Unlike Russians, we have spirit and love for our
country, and that is all you need.''
Russian military officials expect Gudermes, 25 miles to the east, to
become the new stronghold of resistance.
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, who is under fire for the high
death toll and the level of force used in Chechnya, said an analysis of
the army operation would be made later this month.
Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin sacked Colonel-General Georgy
Kondratyev, one of several top generals who have condemned the use of
the army on Russian soil.
Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev today described Russia's
millitary intervention in Chechnya as a huge mistake which would cost
the country dear.
In an interview with BBC television, Gorbachev said he had warned
President Yeltsin about the consequences of sending in troops and had
offered to act as a mediator.
''They've unleased terrible bloodshed, they've set the army against
its own people, because these are our own people. They've sent untrained
boys to fight, who don't know what war is,'' Gorbachev said.
''It's a huge mistake. And it's going to cost us dear. Not just in
economic terms but especially politically and morally. Those in power
have put themselves in a corner.''
Gorbachev, who during his seven years in power led the Soviet Union
from communism to democracy, said the intervention was a great defeat
for the Russian government.
''They've lost in Russia, they've lost in the Caucasus, they've lost
in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), they've lost in
relations with the West.''
Gorbachev refused to be drawn on whether he would be a candidate for
the Russian presidency in elections due in June 1996 but said the
present government was sliding towards authoritarianism.--Reuter

GROWERS holding on to last season's wheat in the hope of cashing in on
top prices are distorting the market, according to Mr Don Patterson,
general manager of Dalgety Grain.
He has warned that prices could drop from April onwards as large
tonnages come on to the market over a short period.
Mr Patterson estimates that about four million tonnes of mainly
quality wheat is till left on farms. Area aid payments are also
contributing to the distortion, he claims. ''Growers who are flush with
cash are less reliant on releasing grain on a regular basis to maintain
cash flow.''

WORK began yesterday on felling giant oaks in a Perthshire forest, to

The hall's original sixteenth century hammer beam structure was
removed around 1800 when the castle was converted into barracks for the
Napoleonic Wars.
Recreating the old roof, which could take up to eight years, will
begin in the spring as part of a #20m restoration scheme at the castle
being carried out by Historic Scotland.
Around 350 oak trees from Bailefuil Wood, north of Callander, will be
needed to provide enough 30ft logs for the roof beams. The felling is
being done in consultation with Scottish Natural Heritage and the
Forestry Commission's commercial arm, Forest Enterprise.

GRAND National hero Bob Champion led the tributes to his former
colleague John Burke, who died on Wednesday, aged 41.
Mr Burke, who completed the rare Cheltenham Gold Cup-Grand National
double on Royal Frolic and Rag Trade in 1976, rode Mr Champion's famous
Grand National winner Aldaniti in the jumping scenes for the film
Champions.
''John was a great jockey who won all the top races including Gold
Cups and Grand Nationals,'' Mr Champion said yesterday. ''He was a
smashing character who was full of life and a great horseman. John will
be sadly missed.''
Mr Burke, who quit riding at the end of the 1984-85 season, died at
his home in Upton-upon-Severn of a heart attack.
He left a wife, Lynn and two children, Kelly, 19, and Josh, 17.
In recent years Mr Burke had been head lad to Kinnersley trainer Mr
Simon Christian who said he was ''shocked and saddened'' by his death.
''He had been with the yard for four years until last summer when he
had to give up riding due to arthritis,'' said Mr Christian.
''Apart from a bit of arthritis in his shoulder, John was a fit man
who was very active and played a full part in the running of the yard.''
Mr Christian said that his former head lad, who had recovered from a
recent operation to his shoulder, had driven past the gallops earlier in
the week and given a cheery wave to the lads.
He said: ''It was a great privilege to have worked with him and I know
that the whole village are deeply shocked at his death. Our hearts go
out to his wife Lynn and his children Kelly and Josh.''

Mearns. Noting that Mearns had a previous conviction for dangerous
driving, Sheriff Jock Smith jailed him for three months and banned him
from driving for two years. He ordered Martin, a first offender, to
perform 175 hours' community service and banned him from driving for two
years. Both will have to resit their driving tests.

ROBBIE DINWOODIE, Scottish Political Correspondent, dips a toe into
the debate on regional government south of the Border, and finds it
decidedly tepid.
NO-ONE talks about devolution and assemblies any more in Scotland.
Here, suspicious of the dictum that power devolved is power retained, we
have moved away from the term devolution and a Scottish Parliament is
discussed in other phrases, the tried and trusted Home Rule, the newer
buzz-words popular sovereignty and the SNP's slogan Independence in
Europe.
However, England is beginning to wake up to the idea of regional
government as a means of decentralising and democratising the monolith
of quangoised control from Westminster, and it is like listening in on a
conversation at a bus stop between two people who have just come out of
a coma after 20 years.
The debate south of the Border is less developed, poorly focused. A
long learning curve lies ahead. Mr Tony Blair's plan for English
regional assemblies, as a way of squaring the circle of Mr Tam Dalyell's
West Lothian question, has brought a near-hysterical reaction from
senior Conservatives.
The Prime Minister has made his attack on the idea of regional
assemblies for England a central plank of his defence of the Union and
rejection of constitutional change. His claim that there is no demand
whatever in England for decentralised, democratic government is not
borne out by our poll, although it clearly touches a chord in his own
party.
We started by asking the English a question about their perception of
their own national identity. This showed that 51% considered themselves
British, compared to 41% who saw themselves as English. It may be that
the English tend to use these terms virtually interchangeably but it was
a marked contrast with North of the Border, where 78% considered
themselves Scots and only 19% chose to label themselves British.
Respondents then had put to them the recent political debate about
devolved government for Britain, with proposals for bodies in Scotland,
Wales, and the English regions. They were asked, if there were a
referendum tomorrow on this issue how would they vote -- in favour of or
against the setting up of these separate assemblies?
Serious opposition to this from Conservative voters -- 60% against,
24% in favour, with 16% recorded as don't knows -- was influential in
producing a narrow rejection overall by 39% to 35%.
Mr Blair will be heartened that his party's supporters were most
enthusiastic about the idea, favouring it by 43% to 33%. Liberal
Democrats, however, who consider themselves to be the natural party of
decentralisation and federalism, may be disappointed to find that their
voters' support for regional assemblies was lukewarm, with a narrow
majority of 38% to 37%.
The regional breakdown is surprising, however, with no obvious
North-South divide in England, as might have been expected. The North
West of England, for example, gave less support to the concept of
regional autonomy than did the South East, while the South West -- as a
Liberal heartland with a Cornish nationalist element -- came out
strongly against the idea.
The most favourable response came in the West Midlands (36% to 31%),
with East Midlands in favour 37% to 35% and the North (effectively the
North East) supporting regional assemblies by 42% to 40%. This region
had one of the lowest levels of don't knows, which may reflect the fact
that there has been considerable local debate on the issue over time.
During the Scottish devolution debate of the 1970s, North East MPs
were active in arguing that this should go ahead only if they got an
assembly too. This has turned full circle in recent months with the
launch of a Campaign for a Northern Assembly, a body modelled on the
Campaign for a Scottish Assembly which has the advice and support of the
latter.
East Anglia appeared most hostile to the plan -- against by 58% to 34%
-- but given the sparse population of the area even an exercise as
extensive as our System Three poll may provide too small a sample to be
reliable. The South West was against by 47% to 31%; the North West by
40% to 32%; Yorkshire and Humberside by 34% to 32%; and the South East
by 39% to 38%.
The real winner in the English poll could most charitably be described
as a lack of knowledge on which to base an opinion. Put another way,
apathy seems to be the victor. Only 7% of respondents considered
devolution a very important factor in their voting intentions (barely
higher on 9% for Labour supporters) and only 19% considered the issue
quite important.
Those who considered it neither important nor unimportant totalled
19%, while 26% said this issue was not very important and 23% considered
it not at all important. One result of this apathy is that the issue is
not a risky one for the major parties in electoral terms.
Asking whether stances on devolution would influence voters in their
choice of party produced a minimal response. For example, 7% of people
said Labour's devolution could lead them to switch to Labour, while 12%
said it could put them off. However, since the vast bulk of that 12%
group were already confirmed anti-Labour voters the actual impact would
be minimal.
Mr Chris Eynon of System Three says: ''Overall, the effect of this
policy on levels of support for Labour in England was likely to be
negligible,'' with perhaps a marginal potential gain for the
Conservatives. ''Given the lack of importance attached to these more
generally, however, it is other issues which will have a much stronger
bearing in determining votes gained or lost.''
For the sake of comparison with our poll this week on Scottish
attitudes to self-government, we asked an identical question North and
South of the Border. It stated: ''John Major has said that the setting
up of separate assemblies for Scotland and Wales will lead ultimately to
a break-up of the UK. What are your views on England, Scotland, and
Wales becoming independent countries, each governed separately?''
Only 8% were very much in favour of this in England (compared to 26%
in Scotland), while 17% were slightly in favour (21% in Scotland). A
larger proportion were undecided in England (32%) than in Scotland
(17%), while those against totalled 35% in England and 25% in Scotland.
The highest figure in support of the break-up of the UK came in the
North (North East), where 34% were in favour, again reflecting the fact
that people there are further down the road of forming an opinion on
constitutional change.
Snapshot of election intentions
BY going in to England for the first time with poll for The
Herald/System Three, the exercise has provided the spin-off of a
snapshot of voting intentions South of the Border.
In order to give the necessary information for analysing people's
attitudes to the issues, respondents were asked the standard question
normally asked in our monthly polls North of the Border, ''If there was
a General Election tomorrow which of these would you vote for?''
Analysing these by their usual methods, and excluding the 15% who were
undecided or refused to indicate their preference, System Three
calculate the current party standings in England (excluding Wales and
Scotland) as: Conservatives 26%, Labour 56%, Liberal Democrats 14%,
Greens 3%.

KEY FINDINGS
Key findings of The Herald/System Three poll on English attitudes to
devolution:
* Most English people see themselves as British first (51%) and
English second (41%) -- the opposite of north of the Border, where
Scottish is the main self identity (78%) and British a poor second
(19%).
* A referendum tomorrow on the idea of having separate devolved
Assemblies for Wales, Scotland and the regions of England would be
defeated by 39% to 35% by the English electorate, with 25% undecided (in
Scotland the don't knows total only 3%).
* Conservative voters are more set in their hostile views, rejecting
the idea by 60% to 24%, Labour most enthusiastic at 43% to 33% in
favour, and Liberal Democrats narrowly supporting the plan 38% to 37%.
* On a regional breakdown East Anglia and, perhaps surprisingly, the
South West are most hostile, followed by the North West, with Yorkshire
and Humberside and the South East narrowly against.
* Most in favour are the West Midlands, followed by the North (that is
the North East) and the East Midlands.
* Apathy is the real winner. Only 26% regarded the issue as important,
19% are neutral and 50% feel it is not important.
* The issue is neither a significant vote winner or loser. It might
win as few as 2% to the Labour cause while putting off 3% of party
supporters, or attract 2% to the Conservatives' hostile stance, which
might cost that party less than half of one per cent.
* Given John Major's prediction that devolution would lead to the
break-up of the UK, 25% of English voters say they are in favour of this
happening, with 44% against and 32% undecided (Scots figures were 47% in
favour, 35% against and 17% undecided).
* There are indications that the debate is more informed in the the
North than elsewhere, with sharper divisions and fewer undecided,
perhaps reflecting the fact that this region has always taken an
interest in the subject is now the scene of a vigorous Campaign for a
Northern Assembly.
* The System Three poll of 1559 adults throughout England was carried
out in their homes between January 25 and 31 in 145 constituencies,
using a random sampling method for selection of respondents which was
then weighted during analysis to match the population in terms of age,
sex and class.

The Karen people of Burma have been fighting for autonomy for 40
years. Now the army that was trained by Britain to fight the Japanese is
on the point of defeat by a brutal regime -- and Britain will not help
FIFTY years after the Imperial Japanese army was thrown out of Burma,
a British-raised rebel army today faces capture, torture, and decimation
in circumstances eerily reminiscent of the brutal Japanese occupation.
In a camp situated in a horseshoe of the Moei River, on the Thai-Burma
border, the scene of fierce fighting during the Second World War, the
remnants of the Karen National Liberation army, whose leaders operated
behind Japanese lines with Force 136, are putting up a last stand
against thousands of troops of SLORC, Burma's ''Big Brother'', the
Burmese State Law and Order Restoration Council.
Unless international pressure is brought against the Burmese
Government to stop the excesses of the Burmese People's Army this year
will see an end to the 40-year-old struggle by the Karen for autonomy.
The Karen, some of whose officers still remember with some emotion
ambushing Japanese troops in British-led expeditions, are hopelessly
outnumbered. Two weeks ago their main base, Manerplaw, fell to a heavy
Burmese bombardment, sending a flood of 10,000 refugees fleeing across
the Thai-Burmese border. Others have fled to jungle hideouts in Burma to
regroup.
When the SLORC brutally regained power in Rangoon in 1988 after
democracy riots and after declaring void the election in which Burmese
people's heroine Aung San Suu Kyi was outright winner, it was to the
Karen-controlled areas of Eastern Burma that the Burmese students fled
to form their own army to fight the Rangoon military junta.
Many of those students, more mature, well-trained, and accustomed to
the malarial jungle, are fighting alongside the Karen in the ABSDF --
All Burma Students Democratic Front.
For the past two days in Kawmoora the air has resounded to the Burmese
Government barrage. Howitzer and heavy mortar fire, some using air-burst
phosphorus shells, are pounding this base -- the headquarters of the
KNLA's crack 101st Battalion.
Access to the front line is barred by Thai troops, but Karen officers
say that the Burmese are using civilians to test their mine field
defences, but with the Burmese claiming that 4000 have deserted the
Karen, this is also a propaganda war.
In a separate attack Burmese troops crossed to the Thai side to
attempt to assault the base from the rear, but they withdrew when Thai
troops opened fire.
International politics will be the deciding factor in whether the
Karen will be annihilated or allowed to regroup to continue to fight a
guerrilla war behind SLORC lines.
The full catalogue of atrocities against the Karen, detailed by
Amnesty International, no longer carry the same weight with foreign
governments who are anxious to do trade with Burma.
Refugees streaming across the border talk of summary executions, of
their relatives being tortured to death, including slow mutilation and
burning. But British, American, Singapore, Thai and Chinese companies
are already well established in Rangoon and doing business.
Fifty years ago 16,000 allied prisoners of war, including Sherwood
Foresters, Argyll and Sutherland and Gordon Highlanders, and soldiers of
the Leicesters, East Surrey, Beds and Herts and Manchester Regiments
died, as forced labourers building the Burma-Siam (Death) Railway.
History is repeating itself in the lands of the Karen, just 60 miles
away from Hell Fire Pass, one of the major scenes of Japanese brutality
along the infamous railway.
Here another railway is being built. This time by the Burmese. So far
between 200 to 300 people are estimated to have died.
According to refugees fleeing to Thailand, forced labourers are
subject to horrific beatings, debilitating illnesses and are neither
paid nor given food. The Burmese Government uses forced labour for most
of its infrastructural projects.
The railway is needed to enable the construction of a pipeline to run
to Thailand from an Andaman Sea gas field. The field is being developed
by Unocal of the United States and Total of France. Two days after the
fall of Manerplaw the Thai Government signed a trade agreement for gas
through this pipeline worth #250m a year to the Burmese Government.
While Britain's connections to the Karen are now tenuous, returning to
this region of conflict does evoke nostalgic memories.
Four years ago on visit to the Karen's jungle headquarters Major Aaron
Po Yin, a Karen staff officer and friend, asked me if I could go to
London to collect the Distinguished Service Medal he had won for bravery
in ambushes behind Japanese lines.
Major Aaron, formerly with the Burmese Navy, was dropped behind enemy
lines to fight alongside British Major Seagrim -- known to the Karen as
Grandfather Long Legs -- who was executed as a spy by the Japanese in
1943.
I travelled to London and returned with the medal some six months
later when it was pinned to his tunic to his obvious delight. He died
soon afterwards.
Having served with the British fighting the Burmese and Japanese, he
could not come to terms with the treaty Britain signed with Burma,
giving the country independence and the Karen nothing.
''Why did the British forget the Karen when we gave you such
loyalty?'' he once asked. In the expediency of South-east Asian politics
the more politically astute of the Karen leaders know that Burma's
yet-to-be exploited riches come higher on the regional agenda than the
future of an ethnic minority.

NEXT week The Herald introduces expanded editorial coverage which will
further confirm the paper as Scotland's premier daily quality newspaper.
The expansion of The Herald comes as new circulation figures show the
paper selling 30,000 copies a day more than the Scotsman. Officially
audited readership figures for the period January to December, l994,
also reveal the margin of The Herald's lead over the Scotsman. The
Herald with a readership figure of 378,000 has 126,000 more readers than
the Scotsman at 252,000.

THE Clydesdale Bank faces its first strike, after staff voted in
favour of a series of one-day walkouts in a bitter pay dispute.
Leaders of the Banking, Insurance,and Finance Union yesterday warned
that the first strike would go ahead on Friday next week, if the dispute
was not resolved meantime.
The union also claimed that many of the bank's 325 branches would be
forced to close on the days of industrial action.
Despite talks breaking down on Monday, without any agreement being
reached on a slightly improved offer, the bank announced the following
day that it was proceeding with that pay package.
It said increases of between 3% and 7% would be awarded to
''satisfactory performers'', but no rises would be given to the fewer
than 10% of employees whose performance was considered less than
satisfactory.
The union is seeking a 6.75% average pay rise for its 4000 members
among the bank's 6000 staff, and has accused the management of treating
employees with contempt by pushing ahead with the pay package without
agreement.
The Clydesdale was taken over eight years ago by the National
Australia Group, and Bifu blames the parent company for an alleged
crisis in industrial relations. The union pointed to the Clydesdale's
record profits of #110m last year, and said staff deserved a better
deal.
The result of the strike ballot, announced at Bifu's Glasgow office
yesterday, showed that those members who did vote backed action by more
than two-to-one: 1721 for, 746 against.
''This vote reflects the deep unrest among Clydesdale staff at the
performance culture being forced upon them,'' said Mr Keith Brookes,
Bifu's assistant secretary.
Union leaders emphasised that they hoped the dispute could be resolved
without a strike taking place. They said that they were asking Acas to
intervene and remained open to talks.
Mr Brookes added: ''We hope the bank behaves sensibly, but the bank's
actions this week have not been sensible, so I do not hold out a great
deal of optimism there. It would appear to me that there will be a
strike a week Friday.''
A spokesman for the Clydesdale Bank expressed disappointment at the
vote for strike action, but added that the bank felt the result would
have been very different if the staff had been voting on the improved
offer.
He said: ''We certainly hope to avert strike action and we will
consider going to Acas to avoid such action.''
But he rejected the union's claim that many branches would have to
close on the days of strikes.

Assorted musicbiz types descended on Glasgow for the A&amp;R Festival,
hoping to find the next pop sensation. David Belcher joined the throng.
IN the week that the London record industry came sniffing round
Glasgow en masse, some of our bands fawned like puppies while others
snarled and pooped on the hands that were ostensibly offering to feed
them.
Lung Leg were the ones baring their teeth and assuming the moral high
ground during the Glasgow A&amp;R Festival, which reaches its conclusion in
three different city-centre venues tonight.
Scheduled to appear at the 13th Note on Wednesday, Lung Leg
deliberately dropped out. Why?
Because Lung Leg are commendably spikey agit-punk purists.
''The idea of playing for record companies and putting on an act,''
said drummer Jade Green, her lips pursing ever-so-slightly into a
disdainful moue. ''If people are genuinely interested in us, they'll
find out who we are when we play our regular gigs.''
Note to metropolitan musicbiz talent-spotters: Lung Leg's next gig is
next month, a fundraiser for Body Positive at Nice'n'Sleazy with Mambo
Taxi, Bis, and Pink Kross. Additionally, they've a John Peel Radio 1
session being broadcast a week on Saturday, and their current
seven-track EP, The Negative Delinquent Autopsy, is available on the
Piao label.
But if Lung Leg weren't playing during the A&amp;R week, how did I get to
talk to them? Because they were in the front row for shows by Yummy Fur
and the Blisters, frugging coolly in their stylish cocktail frocks and
engaging in matily irreverent badinage across the footlights with both
groups.
For instance, when the Blisters' vocalist announced their penultimate
song as Nostalgia, a sharp-witted Lung Leg-ite vouchsafed an instant
correction: ''I thought it was Neuralgia.'' The Blister chuckled. ''Very
good,'' he said. But how good were the Blisters and Yummy Fur?
It's safe to say that, like Lung Leg, Yummy Fur are probably not
enamoured of being hotly clutched to the bosom of the metropolitan
recordbiz for the purposes of being groomed as the new Eternal or East
17. Instead, they seem inspired by the sonic anarchy of Spike Jones and
Captain Beefheart, with none of their songs lasting more than 90
seconds, to boot. Indeed, during a flying visit to Nice'n'Sleazy's
lavatory, I missed two whole Yummy Fur opuses.
Having kicked off with a laconic re-cap of their most recent review in
the music media -- ''Apparently we're 'quirky punk-pop with a
barbed-wire edge' '' -- Yummy Fur went on to reveal themselves as
creators of an abrasively-funny 100mph pop-punk. I was especially
tickled by Yummy Fur's lyrics. ''Cyclops,'' was one song's single-word
chorus, while another repeatedly employed a simple five-word mantra --
''There is no Santa Claus'' -- to tell us that . . . well, there is no
Santa Claus.
Hopefully, Christmas will arrive early in the form of a big-league
recording contact for the Blisters, who, contrary to the rawness of
their punk-redolent name, are a literate and sinisterly foppish bunch of
classic songsmiths sporting exquisitely-knotted ties and Edwardian
three-piece pinstripe suits, complete with watch-chains.
Assisted by occasional deft bursts of atmospheric trumpet, the
Blisters are a gutsier, rockier, yet more languid riposte to the
Housemartins. There is a fatalistic music-hall jauntiness to much of
what they do, and if they don't get signed up pronto, the British music
industry is more dead-in-the-head than we all think it is. Sadly, I
didn't spot many A&amp;R types at the Blisters' show.
So what were London's A&amp;R legions most obviously interested in? To
date, the bulk of the industry's attention seems to have focused on the
Paul Weller-esque Ball of Confusion. Travis are rumoured to be on the
brink of putting pen to paper; Captain Shifty attracted King Tut's
biggest paying audience of the week, while the Supernaturals, Melonhaus
and Goldust all pulled large numbers of scouts.
''I can't speak for other venues, but for me, the industry actually
turning up has been the highlight of the week,'' said Paul Cardow, of
the Cathouse, well-used to A&amp;R geezers phoning ahead to request
guest-list placings which, on the night, they then fail to utilise.
''Punter-wise, I think it's been far from brilliant, which is a shame,''
he added. At one Glasgow show, in fact, half the 70-strong audience were
A&amp;R men, publishers, or media.
Other venues report healthy attendances by paying customers, however,
with brisk over-the-bar sales for Nice'n'Sleazy's Plug 2 CD, the venue's
second such sampler for 11 up-and-coming local bands. Unfortunately,
there was less interest in the week's most hotly-tipped act -- no names,
to save their blushes -- whose less-than-perfect opening song managed to
repel the large numbers of scouts they'd attracted.
And what of the three A&amp;R types who tumbled into King Tut's hot on the
heels of Creation supremo Alan McGee, a week-long fixture in his home
town? Who you in to see tonight, lads, they were asked. ''We don't
know,'' came the giggly reply. ''We're just going wherever McGee goes.''
Ah, the music biz. To know the beast a little is to realise that you
need to know it a whole lot more. Thumbs aloft and caps raised to the
Glasgow A&amp;R Festival and its tireless organiser, Geoff Ellis, for
allowing us to have increased our knowledge this week through first-hand
exposure and observation.
* NATURALLY, all my Boss Grooves revelations are exclusive, but
sometimes some of them are more exclusive than others. Like this one:
you might be advised to start queuing now outside all the usual
booking-agencies for tickets for a special gig by Faith No More on March
10 at Glasgow's Garage. Tickets go on sale Monday.

RUGBY player Brian Conlan, Alloa's Midlands District Union wing, is in
the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, after an operation to remove a
blood clot from his brain. He collapsed on Saturday evening after he had
played for the fourth-division club in a friendly match against their
Tillicoultry neighbours, Hillfoots, though it is not known if his injury
was rugby-related. Conlan had also played on the wing for the Midlands
in the District Union championship match against Edinburgh at Kirkcaldy
a week past Wednesday.

Mary Brennan discerns a degree of humbug in the reactions to a group
of disabled people who dare to challenge established stereotypes
EVEN before it got on stage, Graeae's Ubu had managed to get up
people's noses. Newham Council banned the poster as likely to cause
offence -- passers-by could have been outraged by the cumulative
incorrectness of a semi-naked man wearing fur, smoking a fag, with a
rude word inscribed on his behind.
The production itself played to packed houses at the local arts
centre. The Guardian vetoed the same publicity shot, murmuring
protectively of readers' sensibilities.
Heigh-ho! At the Traverse last weekend, crowds of folk -- from
schoolgirls to elder citizens -- passed dozens of the self same image
without batting an eyelid. I asked one girl what she thought. She
glanced, grinned and said: ''Cheeky!''
Ewan Marshall, the company's artistic director, says they were
somewhat bemused by the objections. ''How do you present one of the
nastiest characters in theatre history without unpleasant imagery?
You're talking here about the worst excesses of dictatorship -- it's a
play that predicts the twentieth century appallingly well -- and Ubu is
a crude, vicious thug!''
When they mulled it over, they realised ''there is nothing nice about
Ubu . . .'' And then they wondered -- not for the first time -- if this
shudder of official distaste wasn't more about who they were . . .
Graeae is Britain's -- probably Europe's -- leading theatre company of
disabled people. Since the start of the eighties it has toured
productions that have focused specifically on aspects of disabled
experience, sometimes from a historical perspective and sometimes as a
reflection of current circumstances.
This new translation of Ubu is the first classic text to be staged by
the company. It's bawdy, anarchic and very, very physical. And probably
not quite what the public expects to see from disabled performers, says
Ewan.
It did cross their minds, when Newham sent back the posters that, yet
again, they were up against certain gut-feelings about disabled people
in general. ''Frankly, they are not expected to behave so badly,'' Ewan
laughs. But, as he points out, such expectations are no joking matter.
He's constantly made aware, even by the most well-intentioned folk,
that the disabled really have very few rights. And being loud,
scatological, and sexually rampant -- albeit on stage -- is seen in some
quarters as inappropriate behaviour for someone in a wheelchair.
As he talks, the sheer rottenness of Ubu's swaggering regime takes on
the gloss of our own society where everyone seems to be studying for
A-level hypocrisy. Yes, says Ewan, talks with the BBC have opened up
windows of opportunity for disabled actors and writers. But the doors of
the various buildings remain too narrow for wheelchair access.
''And the colleges are always apologetic -- but what about safety?
What if there's a fire?'' Almost as if she's picking up on Ewan's
conversation, Lara Bowen -- current administrator of Glasgow-based Birds
of Paradise -- is talking about the problems that face disabled actors
who want to train as professionals.
In a bid to offset this training deficit, Birds of Paradise -- who
have pioneered mixed-ability theatre in Scotland -- are currently
running a series of Monday afternoon professional drama classes at
Strathclyde Arts Centre. I met up with Lara, and with Andy Dawson and
Fiona Millar (who are leading the 11-week course) after the second
session. Already there was a strong sense of positive feedback among the
group whose ages range from the twenties to the fifties.
That day's programme had focused on voice work. Breathing exercises,
vocalisation techniques, ways of using sounds expressively -- Fiona and
the group had gone well beyond words as they explored different avenues
of communication.
No one, however, pretends that any of it -- the training, the job
hunting, the performing -- is easy. Ewan Marshall, of Graeae, ruefully
says he doesn't know what's more soul destroying. Being ignored or being
patronised. With Ubu -- which one critic gleefully described as ''a
Quentin Tarantino reading of Punch and Judy'' -- Graeae cock a snook at
stuffed shirt attitudes to disability. And no one in the Traverse
audience will applaud louder than the Birds of Paradise crowd who are in
training to make dramatic waves of their own.
Ubu is at the Traverse, Edinburgh, until Sunday.

NATIONAL Health Service quangos should meet in public in a move to end
the climate of secrecy and fear in the service, the Nolan inquiry into
standards in public life was told yesterday.
''Gagging clauses'' which stop NHS staff from speaking out about their
concerns should also be scrapped, said Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary
of the technical union MSF.
He told the Nolan Committee that appointments to NHS bodies should be
politically balanced and responsibility for them should be taken away
from the Government.
His union's report to the committee said many health service staff
were concerned at the effects on patient care of the new, sometimes
''excessively vigorous'', commercial ethos in the NHS.
''It is no exaggeration to say that a climate of fear now exists
within the NHS, and this has given rise to considerable staff concern
about the issue of freedom of speech,'' the report said.
The only way to tackle excessive secrecy was to introduce an
independent element, with staff able to take concerns beyond management,
perhaps to the health service ombudsman.
0 Labour MP for Workington, Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, a long-standing
critic of MPs being allowed to accept paid lobbying work and other
private interests, urged the appointment of an Ethics Registrar for
Parliament.
The registrar, supported by a secretariat, would investigate
complaints about MPs and Ministers, and would report to Parliament and,
if necessary, the Prime Minister.
Conservative Iain Duncan Smith, MP for Chingford, said he believed
some of the problems surrounding MPs' interests could be solved by
''complete and utter disclosure''.

IT had been 20 years, said Alan Skidmore, since he'd last played in
Edinburgh (gigs with Stan Tracey and Georgie Fame not included). His
intentions were obviously to make Auld Reekie see what it had been
missing. A tenor saxophonist in the John Coltrane tradition, Skidmore
plays with a level of commitment that can be all but overpowering but
which is balanced by an ever-present control.
This made his pairing with John Burgess an interesting and contrasting
departure from the two-tenors-going-for-it approach which often results
in these situations. Burgess develops his solos tangentially,
occasionally overblowing but with a light tone, whereas Skidmore's tone
is dark and his solos always build from deep within the song structure.
They chose several pieces with Coltrane associations. Skidmore's first
half feature of Mal Waldron's gorgeous Soul Eyes carefully avoided
dewy-eyed sentiment and Coltrane's racing, modal Impressions drew
forthright, impassioned statements from both players.
The latter also featured a terrific solo from pianist David Milligan
which began in minimalist fashion and developed into something halfway
between the volcanic and the rhapsodic. Milligan is rapidly becoming the
pianist to watch in Scotland and worked well with bassist Kenny Ellis
(good sound, harmonically confident), although the rather excitable
drummer Tom Gordon undermined their good work before finally settling
down in the second half.
Burgess's effective bass clarinet reading of In A Sentimental Mood and
Skidmore's wry, wily Weaver of Dreams formed a lull before the storm
that was Mr PC, an exhaustive romp through Coltrane's tribute to bassist
Paul Chambers that left the band apparently drained and the audience
utterly replete.

ENTITLED Baroque and Celtic Charms, last night's programme from the
John Currie stable blended an intriguing mix of the familiar and the
unknown. Standards from Vivaldi and Bach preceeded the surprise --
Morris Pert's Ancient Rites.
Commissioned in the early eighties by The John Currie Singers, Ancient
Rites (subtitled Nine Incantations from the Hebridean Isles), is scored
for 16 solo voices and a small string orchestra. Inspired by the
nineteenth-century Gaelic manuscript Carmina Gadelica, the piece
juxtaposes a potentially dangerous combination of the sacred and the
secular.
Last night's was an atmospheric performance casting enchanting spells
and dropping moments of magic. Four solo episodes for soprano
Caroline-Louise Fairbrother, mezzo Colette Ruddy, tenor Dennis Haggerty
and bass John Beazley projected simple, affecting folk tunes. Ruddy's
voice fell like a breath of fresh air -- rich and impassioned, her
singing came deep from within. Choral sections revealed a versatile
ensemble.
Earlier Vivaldi's Gloria failed to shine like the baroque jewel that
it really is. Dragging tempi and lacklustre expression produced a
somewhat pedantic performance save Ruddy's divine Domine Deus. With
obbligato roles for oboe, trumpet, and harpsichord, Barbara Rhodes,
Sandy McGrattan, and John Langdon respectively were able to reveal their
instrumental virtuosity.
The same cannot be said for violinists Clive Thomas and Brian Hale --
their execution of Bach's Double Concerto left much to be desired. Both
able soloists in their own right, the balance was all wrong, Bach's
delightful outer dance movements failing to come to life.

SAT like a 'cello player with his electric bass, Weber explained the
technology that allows him to produce a multi-layered sound from just
the one instrument. Truth to tell, there is little new in what he does,
although digital delay allows him to pile phrase upon phrase and drone
upon harmonic. John Martyn was doing this sort of thing on the guitar --
and John Surman on the saxophone -- many years ago.
Both of them, however, used the technique as a basis for biting attack
that is alien to the German's ECM-label sound. Weber's music sometimes
makes the most ambient of chill-out sounds seem like punk rock. Mesmeric
yes, but a tad soporific. He heaped on some astonishing bowed harmonics
-- and a trumpet-like effect by playing near the bridge -- but it was
his own playing sans FX that was most impressive. ''Unaccompanied''
pieces like the opening Seven Movements, or the hoedown of Children's
Song No 1 were the pick of the set.
Saxophonist Tommy Smith and Murray McLachlan, who opened the concert,
also played a couple of Children's Songs, but from the pen of Chick
Corea. Their duo is potentially one of the most exciting partnerships to
emerge in Scottish music in a while. In a programme framed by two
four-movement sonatas by Smith, they included Satie, Grieg, Bartok, and
Poulenc. Smith was in Jan Garbarek territory with Grieg's Arietta, but
made it his own, while the reading of Satie's Gnossienne No 1 -- a
Glasgow brasserie favourite thanks to its film soundtrack use -- was
another highlight.

A POLICE sergeant yesterday told how an attempt to arrest a violent
schizophrenic ended in the death of a young police constable in a
Glasgow street.
Constable Lewis Fulton, 28, died from a stab wound last June after he
answered an SOS call from fellow officers who were trying to arrest an
18-year-old man in the Gorbals.
He was yesterday posthumously awarded the Chief Constable's Very High
Commendation, the highest bravery award which can be given to a
policeman.
His widow, Christine, accepted the award from Councillor James
Jennings, convener of Strathclyde region's police and fire committee.
Chief Constable Leslie Sharp offered Mrs Fulton words of encouragement
at the ceremony, and later showed her an exhibit dedicated to her late
husband in the force's museum at its Pitt Street headquarters.
The exhibit contains items collected by his mother to reflect his
school life, interests and, in particular, his achievements in swimming
and lifesaving.
Constable Fulton's parents and his 15-month-old son Luke, also
attended the ceremony. Seven police colleagues who attended the incident
received the same award.
Sergeant William Blair, 33, who suffered a stab wound to his arm, told
how officers attended a family disturbance at a house in Norfolk Street
in Glasgow's Gorbals.
Constable Fulton had gone to assist colleagues who were having
difficulty in arresting the man. He was stabbed in the chest and died a
short time later in the city's Victoria Infirmary.
McFadden was arrested after being pursued along several busy streets
after leaving the house. More than 30 police officers were involved in
the operation.
In October, he was ordered to be detained at the State Hospital in
Carstairs, Lanarkshire, after doctors declared him insane at the time of
the attack.
Mr Fulton's widow, said: ''I was very, very proud of Louie. He was a
wonderful husband and father. This award confirms to me that the police
were very proud of him as well.''
She revealed that her husband had previously been injured three times
while on duty, but said he never backed away from anything.
''What he did was totally in character. There was no way he would
leave a fellow officer. He would go to his assistance every time,'' she
said.
* Every officer in Strathclyde is now trained in the use of the
side-handled baton and quick cuffs.

AS DISABLED rights demonstrators staged a mass lobby of Parliament
yesterday, Labour challenged the Government on whether it aimed to block
backbench disabled rights legislation when it comes up for its second
reading in the Commons today.
Shadow Leader of the House, Ann Taylor told MPs that she had received
a letter from the Minister for Disabled People, William Hague, making
clear he would not be asking the House to support the backbench Bill
today.
She warned: ''The thousands of people who are here to lobby their MPs
will be extremely concerned at that reply.''
A similar Bill was quashed when it was talked out by Tory backbenchers
last year, provoking a furious response from the disabled.
Commons Leader Tony Newton told her he was sure Mr Hague ''will seek
to explain the whole position more fully in his speech tomorrow'' to the
House.
Disabled rights campaigners supporting today's measure by Mr Harry
Barnes (Derbyshire North-East -- Lab) complain that the Government's own
legislation, the Disability Discrimination Bill, does not go far enough.
Speaker Betty Boothroyd yesterday brushed aside a complaint from Mr
Barnes over the treatment of the disabled people lobbying Westminister.
He protested in a point of order that loudspeakers for MPs to address
lobbyists had been removed by the Commons authorities despite some
disabled people having hearing problems.
Miss Boothroyd replied: ''The best possible facilities have been made
available by this House and its authorities for the use of Westminister
Hall which holds something like 1500 people.''
She said that everything possible was done to see that those who were
lobbying reached their MPs and that they were able to meet them.

EXCLUSIVE
THE 10-year fight to unlock the treasures of Sir William Burrell will
spill out into the public domain in a final showdown later this year.
The trustees, set up to watch over the collection housed in Pollok
Park in Glasgow, are to challenge an attempt by the district council to
overturn stringent conditions which bar any part of it from travelling
overseas.
They have officially objected to what is, in effect, a private Bill
being promoted through Parliament by the council. If successful it will
allow the council to vary the terms of Sir William Burrell's 1944
agreement and a later 1957 codicil.
The trustees' decision means the matter is now set to be decided at an
inquiry before Parliamentary Commissioners, members of the Houses of
Lords and Commons, in public in Glasgow this summer.
The parliamentary action is the third and final attempt to free the
8500 artefacts left to Glasgow Corporation by Sir William. The council
has considered court action in the past but legal opinion described the
agreement as ''watertight'' and ruled out proposals to challenge it
through the courts.
Friction between the council and the trustees over the use of the
collection has been rising in recently. Only last month in a letter to
Glasgow's Museum director Julian Spalding the trustees threatened legal
action against the council for agreeing to let Burrell artefacts be
shown in Habitat in London.
Both parties have now come to an agreement to allow the Habitat
exhibition to go ahead but on the strict undertaking that the council
does not repeat it until the parliamentary action is decided.
The city council claims its inability to lend the treasures overseas
means that it can't get on the international gallery circuit and receive
works of art to show in Glasgow on a reciprocal basis.
Mr Tom Monaghan, Glasgow District Council's chief executive, said:
''The basic issue is that in order to maximise the value of the
collection for the people of Glasgow we would like to allow some of it
to go overseas.
''The parliamentary action is the only way we could identify to go
forward on this issue. The courts would have found it difficult to rule
on the matter.''
The trustees, while refusing to comment publicly on the issue
yesterday, are known to be extremely unhappy at the council's approach.
It is understood a number feel angered at the council's attempt to
overturn an agreement which they freely entered into thirty years ago.
They held a private meeting yesterday and are expected to release a
public statement on the issue next week.
The trustees' solicitor Mr Robert Taylor of Bannatyne, Kirkwood,
France and Co, said: ''The trustees are considering their position which
has not been finalised and may wish to respond at a later date.''
He said he was not in a position to disclose the names of the
trustees. However, in 1992, they included Mr Colin McDonald of McGrigor
Donald solicitors, Sir Peter Hutchison CBE, chairman of Glasgow
Insurance brokers Hutchison &amp; Craft, businessman and ship owner Mr Peter
Wordie, and Lady Shaw Stewart of Ardgowan.

IT was a carnival day in Dresden. That was how they celebrated Shrove
Tuesday on February 13, 1945, and Christine Otto had dressed up in a
Little Red Riding Hood costume. She had another reason for excitement.
It was her fifth birthday.
That was why she thought it was a special fireworks display for her
benefit. The sirens had sounded. The adults had headed for the cellar
beneath the family home in the Rossebaude suburb of Dresden. The young
ones slipped off into another cellar which had been prepared like a
nursery with toys.
Strictly against regulations, there was an unblacked-out window there
through which the child looked out at a reddened sky flashing with the
first bombs and incendiaries.
She rushed through to the adults to tell them about the fireworks.
Their response was frightening. They were in tears. ''Our poor
Dresden,'' was all that was said. For the rest of her life Christine's
birthdays have been memorials.
Rudiger Eckardt was nine years older, still a boy learning Latin and
Greek at the Kreuzschull (Cross School) in the mornings, considered old
enough to have been drafted into national service in the Nazi
Volkswohlfahrt as a welfare aide in the afternoons. He wore the NSV
arm-band over his school uniform. He was on soup kitchen duties for the
thousands of refugees who fled in daily from the East to Hauptbanhof,
the main station. They would number among the highest casualties of the
bombings.
''It had always been believed that Dresden would not be bombed because
it was an artistic centre,'' he recalls. ''When you need to, you will
believe nonsense. When the attacks came there was absolutely no warning,
and Dresden did not have any bunkers like the cities in Western Germany.
''We made for the cellar and the noise cracked, crashed and roared. My
second oldest sister came through the flames and the burning streets,
trying to reach our home in Racknitz. She was on foot, trying to avoid
the burning buildings and she made it as the second wave of bombers came
in. She had her little boy, one-year-old, in her arms. She had reached
us from the city centre.
''It was over finally. We left Dresden to stay with relatives. On the
way out of the city there were the first dead bodies I had seen in my
life. It was terrible. Mutilated corpses. Just meat and bones. Pictures
you can't forget for the rest of your life. Even in German it's
difficult to express it . . .''
Like many of the Dresdeners I spoke with, he was remarkably
philosophical about the event. I asked him if he still felt any anger.
''No,'' he scorned. ''Against the English? No, it was war, killing,
murder. Hitler started the war and the Luftwaffe bombed London,
Coventry, Newcastle and other cities. But I will say that the
destruction of Dresden was not necessary for victory. The war was
decided.
''The only anger I understand among Dresdeners was over the visit of
the Queen in 1992. It was the worst time because they had raised that
statue for Harris. Old wounds were opened. The Queen never laid a
wreath, she never said any words of regret, and she drove past the
ruined Frauenkirche without even stopping.''
Typical of the courtesy with which I was received by Dresdeners, even
those stopped on the streets of the city, was the response of
84-year-old Ilse Findeklee when I arranged to meet her at her home in
Striessen. She asked what hospitality she should provide. A meal? Coffee
and cakes?
A remarkably alert octogenarian, she laughed as she described the city
she had first come to live in with her husband in 1937. It was a posh
city where people reminded you to wear a hat. The restaurants, contacts
with foreigners, cabarets, cinemas and cafes were part of a city that
had its own reputation in Saxony. It was said that Chemnitz was where
people worked, Leipzig was for commerce, and Dresden was for culture,
festivals and partying.
The mood turned to tears as she remembered the bombing, her swollen
hands agitating with a handkerchief. ''In the cellar, here below this
house, there were 40 people squeezed in. They had jumped off the trams
and run anywhere for shelter. The bricks of the cellar began to move up
and down because of the air pressure and the bombing. I thought the
world was going to collapse.
''Angry? No, I'm just happy I survived. If I felt anger or hatred it
wouldn't change anything. The only thing is, unification of Germany came
too late for me. The rebuilding will be finished later. But it is too
late for me to travel now.''

SEVERAL airports in the Highlands and Islands could face disruption
unless a management proposal to impose wage cuts of 12.5% is removed,
three trades unions warned last night.
Inverness, Benbecula, and Stornoway airports are among those which
could be targeted.
The trades unions, representing more than 200 workers employed by
Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd, warned that the proposal was
''completely unacceptable''.
The unions involved are the Transport and General Workers' Union, the
Civil and Public Services Association, and the Institution of
Professionals, Managers and Scientists.
HIAL is at present a subsidiary of the Civil Aviation Authority. From
April 1 it will come under the control of the Scottish Office and will
be required to reduce its wage bill to comply with Government pay
policy.
The unions are angered at yesterday's management proposal to reduce
earnings by about #500,000 a year by removing premium shift, weekend and
holiday payments.
Management has proposed to buy out the allowances with a one-off lump
sum of #500,000, to be shared between the employees.
Mr Michael McCann, Scottish officer of the CPSA, said last night:
''The company threatened that if our members refused to accept such a
pay cut that HIAL would have to achieve savings by cutting jobs or by
closing airports at weekends.''
The unions are seeking authority to ballot their members for
industrial action.
Mr Paul Jenkins, HIAL general manager, said last night: ''We have no
choice in the matter. We must reduce our wage bill.''

Brussels,
ALEX FALCONER, the Scottish Euro-MP leading the campaign to save
Clause 4 in Labour's constitution, yesterday claimed a breakthrough when
he won unanimous support from the southern and eastern regional council
of the TUC.
Mr Falconer, author of the Guardian advertisement which enraged Labour
leader Tony Blair on his recent visit to Brussels, said: ''This support
comes from the bedrock of the Labour movement, not from some
ultra-leftist fringe. Also significant is that it comes from the area
which the so-called modernisers think is essential to our electoral
success.''
He added: ''The regional council motion also stated that the debate
was unnecessary, divisive and damaging. I couldn't agree more. It should
not have been launched in such a public and unilateral fashion.
Preferably it should not have been launched at all.''
Since the advertisement appeared, carrying the endorsement of more
than half of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, the campaign in
favour of Clause 4 has claimed it is attracting more support.
Mr Falconer said this was very encouraging. ''I think that we are
getting our message across that there can be no social justice without
economic justice.''
He claimed support for retention of the clause from the Transport and
General Workers' Union, the RMT and Aslef, despite speculation that Mr
Blair could eventually rely on a union block vote to get his way.
Mr Falconer, Labour Euro-MP for Mid Scotland and Fife, called on
Scottish members of Labour's national executive to reflect Scottish
opinion in their discussions in London. Mr Blair's campaign for the
abolition of Clause 4 comes to Scotland next week.
Mr Falconer said 26 Scottish constituency parties so far had supported
retention of the clause. Asked what would happen if the Scottish Labour
Party voted to retain Clause 4 but the party elsewhere in the UK voted
against it, he replied: ''At the end of the day we are all part of the
same party."
He said: ''The question you should be asking is: why is that Scottish
representatives on the NEC are not reflecting concern in Scotland?''

Monday is the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Dresden, the most
controversial operation conducted by the Allies to secure victory in the
Second World War. A beautiful city was levelled by 3,500 tons of bombs
and incendiaries dropped in successive waves by Bomber Command and the
US 8th Air Force, creating a firestorm which claimed up to 250,000
lives. JOHN LINKLATER has been in Dresden talking to survivors, and to a
new generation witnessing the city's rebirth. And he has spoken to RAF
men involved in the operation.
SHE is in love with her home city of Dresden. Born 20 years after the
destruction of February 13, 1945, she says it is still a part of her
life. Heike Thorenz, a teacher, knows the lost city from photographs,
from anecdotes and history, from the eighteenth-century cityscapes of
Bellotto (called Canaletto), like infra-red images of a partially
restored, partially obliterated masterpiece. She shares the pride and
pain of Dresden's recovery.
We are in a hotel lobby and she points out of the window down Prague
Street. ''That was our Oxford Street,'' she says. ''It was full of shops
selling beautiful jewellery and furs, cafes full of laughter,
restaurants and dance halls. The heart and soul of Dresden.''
Today it is a pedestrianised hollow between concrete cliffs of
tenements, cheerless canopies and an eccentric circular cinema. They may
have taken down the statue of Lenin opposite what is now a Burger King
on the corner, but we are staring at the unmistakable legacy of the GDR
and a misguided notion of architectural progress.
This was depressingly predictable. It confirmed the 1995 Dresden I had
imagined and dreaded, but I was to discover quickly that it was only one
part of the story. Like so many projected images of Dresden, it was a
distortion of the truth. Retrospectively, we may have tried to
rationalise the destruction. We imagine, if Dresden was bombed to
rubble, it must have been a centre of heavy industry. This is manifestly
untrue.
Dresden is no more industrialised than Edinburgh. In 1945 its most
provocative output was Dresden china figures (more precisely from
Meissen, 20 km down the Elbe) and the supply of army uniforms. It
manufactured Elbflorenz (Florence on the Elbe, the city's pre-war boast)
marzipan and Exquisit brand oriental cigarettes.
There was no armaments production. Dresden did not appear on any of
Air Vice-Marshal Bottomley's Annexes 'A' and 'B' of February 14, 1942,
listing primary industrial targets, alternative industrial areas or
subsidiary targets. Two years later its annihilation was justified as
elimination of an important communications centre, yet the trains were
running out of the shell of the main station, Hauptbanhof, two days
after the attacks by Bomber Command and the US 8th Air Force.
Some Dresdeners today believe the city was destroyed because of
cultural envy. This reflects an embattled attitude which has more to do
with 50 years of intense rivalry with Berlin. Immediately after the war
one of the proposals from the GDR capital was to rebuild Dresden on a
completely new site. Dresdeners are proud people with clear goals. They
forestalled this second potential catastrophe by raising the
eighteenth-century Zwinger Palace themselves, by public subscription
along with Dresden sweat, muscle and loving care. That set the agenda
for the city's recovery.
The stoical progress of this achievement explains the intense pride of
the younger generation. Heike Thorenz says: ''This says something about
the character of the people here. They are very conscious of their
history. I'll never forget the day the Semper Opera House reopened in
1984. The whole family gathered in front of the television set and we
were crying. It was another piece of Dresden given back to the
Dresdeners.''
She breaks the interview to ask if it is not too late for us to go on
a tour of the historic heart of the city. I have only arrived in the
city hours before, and she realises she is describing buildings I have
not yet seen. It is after midnight as she drives us away from the
misconceived modernism of the new Prague Street and within minutes we
turn towards a stunning baroque splendour.
Nothing can prepare the imagination for the architectural confection
of the Zwinger, an elegant fantasy in pale sandstone. It was rebuilt
brick by brick, like a jigsaw. Standing before it is a humbling
experience. The paradox is that you have to see the restoration to
appreciate the magnitude of the destruction.
Dresden was a British and American war crime. All wars inflict
inevitable barbarism, and the total war that was being waged in the
early months of 1945 witnessed the revelations with the liberation of
Auschwitz and the indiscriminate strikes on London civilians through V1s
and V2s; but the political decision to hit Dresden was a disastrous
mistake.
Even a just war against the evil of Nazism should have been restrained
from visiting its pitilessness on a city as beautiful and innocent as
Dresden for no other reason than terror.
Dresden registers a continuing guilt and shame. It was Germany's
Hiroshima, with a higher mortality rate. The figure will never be known.
The city was packed to more than double its normal population of
500,000. It was swollen with refugees as the Soviet Red Army drove west
from Silesia. No records exist for the vast majority of the dead. They
were piled on pyres in the centre of the city. The often-quoted figure
of 35,000 is almost certainly a gross under-estimate, promoted by the
GDR to minimise acknowledgement of the West's brutal power.
Estimates in Dresden are of a death rate as high as 250,000. The
incendiary pattern of bombing (1,182 tons added to 1,478 tons of high
explosives in the two waves of Bomber Command attacks delivered by 796
Lancasters) created a furnace, then a hurricane of fire that sucked in
victims and carbonized them. Or they died by suffocation in cellars,
mildly preferable to being baked alive.
The next day survivors were strafed on streets, in parks, under
bridges and on the banks of the Elbe, into which they were trying escape
the flames, by American Mustang fighters. They had escorted 311 American
B-17s, from which another 771 tons of bombs were dropped on the corpse
of Dresden. It was Ash Wednesday.
For its part, Dresden seeks reconciliation. Memorial events mounted by
the city have consistently incorporated exhibitions, seminars, lectures
and films to pay respect to the 50th anniversay of the liberation of
Auschwitz. A Peace Forum Dresden will be launched on Sunday. Nick Nolan,
mayor of Coventry, is among the main guests at Monday's commemoration,
and the Duke of Kent will take part in the wreath-laying ceremony.
The Mayor of Dresden, Herbert Wagner, says: ''We must not consider the
destiny of our city in isolation. One who says Dresden must also be
aware of others, of St Petersburg and Coventry.''
In 1976 Kurt Vonnegut wrote that the Dresden catastrophe was so
meaningless, finally, that only one person on the entire planet got any
benefit from it. ''One way or another, I got two or three dollars for
every person killed,'' he gave as a characteristically black
self-indictment. He was being unfair on himself. Slaughterhouse-Five,
based on eye-witness experience as an American POW in Dresden during the
firestorm, played an honourable part in changing the attitudes of
younger generations of readers to the conduct of an operation approved
by Allied chiefs of staff and political leaders. The novel also gives
one of the best one-line descriptions of the devastation that was left.
Billy Pilgrim says it looked like the moon.
In Dresden I found the slaughterhouse. An articulated lorry came out
through the barrier gate and headed south. There were plaques with heads
of cattle on the wall. And there was an address above a heavy metal gate
with its square grille: Schlachthofring 5.
This is a city which contains the echoes of many famous visitors.
Johann Sebastian Bach played the priceless Silbermann organ that was
smashed to fragments when the Frauenkirche, the most reknowned
Protestant cathedral in Europe, succumbed to temperatures of up to 2000
degrees and toppled two days after the final bombing attack. Mozart
played in the Catholic Hofkirche in 1789. Dostoevsky gambled. Wagner,
Richard Strauss and Weber had their premieres staged at the Semper
Opera.
Gerhart Hauptmann looked on the ruins in February, 1945, and said:
''Whoever has forgotten how to weep will learn it again with the
destruction of Dresden.''
Reconstruction work has accelerated since unification in 1989. Large
private houses lie empty up in the unscathed residential area of
Loschwitz over the Blue Wonder Bridge. They are subject of protracted
ownership claims, or building costs have proved prohibitive for their
owners. Consortia, large and small, take on individual projects.
Dresdeners watch with keen interest.
At the magnificent Kempinski Hotel, faithfully restored from the
rubble of the Taschenbergpalais between the Castle and the Zwinger, they
have counted 6000 citizens who have accepted the open day invitation
over a single weekend since the doors were reopened in January.
The biggest project of all is the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche at a
cost of more than #100 million over a decade. Replacing each stone is
estimated at #1250. Until last year the rubble lay heaped inside the two
remaining shards of gable that stood like a rotten molar. The midnight
vigil at this site each February 13 began an unofficial peace movement
and a silent protest for freedom that had begun to trouble the GDR
authorities in their last years.
The project has divided opinion in Dresden. Older citizens wanted it
left as a memorial to the folly of war. Younger generations regard it as
a symbol of reborn Dresden.
Heike Thorenz says: ''To preserve even the ruin was costing millions.
Just to keep it standing up. My father is a construction engineer and he
was involved with the project. I think, for the silhouette of Dresden,
the same one that Canaletto painted, it's very important that it be
reconstructed. It should go up, and so will Dresden.''

ONE of the longest-running transfer deals in Scottish football took a
step closer to completion last night when Airdrie FC received outline
planning permission for a #7m stadium on a green belt site at Raebog on
the outskirts of the town.
But the decision enraged some people from the nearby village of
Glenmavis, who have set up a pressure group to lobby against the
proposed stadium.
Several protesters demonstrated outside the district council's
headquarters before the meeting, and stormed out of the public gallery
when the committee approved outline permission for the 10,000-capacity
ground.
Protesters spokesman Steve Taylor called the planning process a
pointless sham, claiming the council was determined to allow what he
described as ''an assault on the green belt'' to go ahead.
The protest group, Glenmavis Opposes Airdrieonians Location of
Stadium, (GOALS) has a petition signed by 746 people, and 355 letters of
objection were also lodged.
The club's application for the Raebog site had been recommended by the
council's director of planning, Mr David Cooper.
After the meeting, Mr Taylor said the protesters would now be
demanding that Strathclyde Regional Council call in the application and
would be writing to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, urging his
intervention.
The region's department of physical planning has objected to the
application.
Airdrie have been seeking a new home for four years after selling
their old ground, Broomfield, to Safeway for a new supermarket.

Dwindling choice and less fresh, local produce appears to flow from
more centralised food distribution. Catherine Brown argues that, despite
the apparent trend, there is a viable alternative we would be Off Our
Trolleys not to pursue
I AM not a regular Wm Low customer, but every now and again I used to
go in for a bag of Donald MacDonald's Alford oatmeal, a tub of
Scots-Italian Rizza Gold Top ice-cream, and John MacArthur's Koepon
yogurt.
Before its takeover by Tesco, Low's policy of supporting small
Scottish producers meant that these, and other locally produced foods,
found a regular shelf space. At the branch in Milngavie the other day,
the Alford oatmeal was still there but the Rizza ice-cream and the
Koepon yogurts had gone.
Was Tesco starting to delist Scotland's small producers? I complained,
of course. There was a complaints book at the newspaper stand, but the
assistant couldn't find it. She would write it down on a piece of paper
and see that it was passed on. I could also fill in a form and send it
to head office.
But no amount of complaining can change a system which makes it
difficult for small local food companies to retain their presence on the
supermarket shelves. Tesco's intentions, according to MacDonald,
MacArthur and Philip Morrison for Rizza's, are -- for the moment --
honourable.
The small food company, however, joins a formidable distribution
system geared to dealing with large manufacturers delivering seven days
a week, in colossal volume, to a central distribution point.
''At the moment we are still sorting out the long-term distribution of
produce in Scotland,'' said Simon Uwins, Tesco's trading director. ''The
takeover has been a very complex business and a few Scottish producers
have gone, but our commitment is to preserve as much of the Scottish
food and drink industry as possible. In some cases there is also the
opportunity for Scottish producers to sell in England.''
For small producers like MacArthur, however, there is still the
problem of delivering his yogurts six days a week from Newton Stewart to
Tesco's CDP in Livingston. ''If they would take a three-day delivery for
small producers like us,'' said MacArthur, ''it would make a tremendous
difference.''
Morrison reported that Tesco had just closed the facility for frozen
food at the old Low's distribution depot in Livingston. Their ice-cream
must now be transported from Huntly to Manchester before it is trucked
back into Tesco stores around Scotland.
Bright modern supermarkets may have expanded the food horizons of
millions but lurking behind the shelves is a system of food retailing
which some argue needs a policy rethink.
Are we Off Our Trolleys? asks a report from the Institute for Public
Policy Research, a charitable body set up in 1988 as an alternative to
free-market think-tanks. Authors, Hugh Raven and Tim Lang, suggest that
the huge growth of the supermarkets in the last couple of decades has
created a food retailing monopoly with hidden social and environmental
costs which are not visible to the millions of shoppers.
Prolific quantities of Vale of Evesham asparagus can be sprouting in
the fields while the local supermarket trucks in bundles of the green
shoots from Spain. Scottish fields can be bristling with oats while the
only available oatmeal in the supermarket hails from England. Specialist
Scottish Italian ice-cream makers can be making superb ice-cream at
reasonable prices yet they are pushed off the shelves by more expensive
Haagen Dazs.
The alternatives to this apparently environmentally damaging and
expensive system of transporting food around the world are slowly
disappearing.
Local markets, where small producers bring their produce to sell
direct, have not been encouraged. What independent food shops there are
left may continue to attract a loyal following, but they are also under
threat of extinction. Direct marketing is a solution which has been
developed in the US, where producers supply their goods directly to the
consumers. In Japan, the produce of a group of 30 farmers from a village
an hour's drive from Tokyo has been brought to over one million
households through a direct marketing initiative.
Compared with the central distribution system operated by the
supermarkets which clocks up thousands of ''food miles'' daily, this may
sound like a better option. But could the nation be fed, efficiently, if
the system changed? Do the small growers/producers seemingly most at
risk from the might of the multiples really want to go back to the old
days?
Supermarkets are a mixed blessing is the conclusion of the Robert Owen
Foundation, managing and marketing agents for the successfully revived
consortium of Scotland's Tomatoes. We do not want to turn the clock
back, but a lot more could be done to sort out the grudges which exist
between growers/manufacturers and the supermarket buyers.
More time and money needs to be invested by the supermarkets educating
their buyers about the products they are buying. The culture of the
supermarket does not lend itself to understanding how food is grown and
manufactured in a local setting.
Nor does it lend itself, it would appear, to catering for low-income
groups and the old, whose access to cheaper foods at out-of-town
multiples is usually dependent on a car, which they don't have, or a bus
journey, which adds to the cost of their purchases.
Edge-of-town supermarkets, taking the business from small High Street
independent shops, has devastated the heart of many towns and cities and
taken food further away from the people. Only the Co-op has been willing
to site its supermarkets in deprived areas of inner cities. But since
the 1980s a new generation of independent food co-ops has developed.
Pioneered in Glasgow and supported by Strathclyde Regional Council,
there are now over 40 small co-ops around the country buying fresh
produce from local markets with minimum transport costs. They are not
dealing with large volume, but they do supply fresh produce at
reasonable prices to areas which have been abandoned by the big
supermarket chains and where the need for more fresh foods is arguably
greatest. Time for a policy rethink?

IN SPITE of the lukewarm response of English Liberal Democrats to the
idea of regional and national assemblies across Britain, the Scottish
party's parliamentary spokeswoman, Mrs Ray Michie, yesterday insisted
that a parliament in Edinburgh would be a springboard for a federal
United Kingdom.
Mrs Michie emphasised that the SLD agreement with Labour on the
details for a Scottish parliament were only a starting point to get the
legislature established.
She made clear that once it was operating, Liberal Democrats would
seek to change its funding mechanism to a system whereby all tax and
revenues generated in Scotland would be paid into a Scottish Exchequer,
which would ultimately pay its share to London for those services and
powers -- foreign policy, defence and macro-economics -- that remained
with the federal parliament at Westminster.
Speaking in Glasgow, she said: ''Federalism is the best answer to the
West Lothian question , because the federal Parliament would not
consider domestic affairs from any other part of the nation.
''Our plans for a Scottish parliament within a federal UK provide the
only coherent constitutional future for Scotland and Britain without
breaking the Union. Even Ian Lang has admitted that our plans have
intellectual integrity and balance.
''The English would have to decide what particular sort of parliament
they wanted. In the meantime, the number of Scots MPs at Westminster
should be reduced and the Secretary of State post abolished.''

THE LABOUR Party returned to the attack yesterday over the
Government's appointment of the chairmen who will run the three new
water services quangos.
Scottish Front Bencher John McFall singled out Dr Ian Preston, who
will head the East of Scotland Water Authority, and will be paid #24,000
a year for one and half day's work a week.
This was the third job Dr Preston had picked up this week, Mr McFall
told a local government conference in Peebles.
While he applauded any attempt to bring down the unemployment figures,
one individual holding down three jobs was hardly the way to go about
it.
Mr McFall said Dr Preston, who is retiring as the #255,000 a year
chief executive of ScottishPower, also had become chairman of the
privatised coal company Mining (Scotland), and had an appointment with
the industrial group Motherwell Bridge.
In view of the remuneration he would receive as water board chairman,
it was reasonable to expect that a public servant would devote all his
energies to the post in question, rather than fitting it in along with
his other considerable responsibilities, Mr McFall said.
He told the annual conference of the Scottish Region of the
Association of Direct Labour Organisations that the failure of the
Tories to win power at local authority level had led them to rely on
appointing people to influential and well-paid posts without making
public the criteria for the appointments.
Also addressing the conference Mr Robert Peggie, chairman of the Staff
Commission -- which advises Scottish Secretary Ian Lang over council
reorganisation -- emphasised the urgent need for the new councillors
elected in April to decide the future of the present Direct Labour
Organisations.
The options for the single- tier councils would include making joint
arrangements to keep the region-wide DLOs going or to establish their
own.
Mr Mark Irvine, Head of Local Government for the public services union
UNISON, urged caution over the possible extension of the use of joint
boards after council reorganisation.  He said they might be a necessary
evil but only in very limited circumstances.

LABOUR last night defended the ''adversarial'' style of political
interviewers such as the BBC's John Humphrys and Jeremy Paxman,
criticised last week by BBC Director General John Birt.
However, in the Commons debate on the future of the BBC, Shadow
National Heritage Secretary Chris Smith also urged broadcasters to
engage in more in-depth analysis.
Mr Smith said: ''If Mr Birt was telling the Today programme in a not
very coded fashion to be more gentle to Health Secretary Virginia
Bottomley, or indeed to me, I hope they will take no notice whatsoever
of him.''
In a speech in Dublin last Friday, Mr Birt criticised overbearing
interviewers who ''sneer disdainfully'' at their subjects.
Humphrys, who presents Radio 4's Today programme, and Paxman, of
television's Newsnight, were immediately assumed to be among his
targets.

DUNDEE'S economy took another blow yesterday with the announcement
that Sunblest Bakery will close making 94 workers redundant.
The bakery, owned by Allied Bakeries, has operated at its Lytton
Street site, in the west end of Dundee, for over 70 years.
Mr Pat Lally, manager of Northern Region Allied Bakeries, met the
workforce yesterday to break the bad news that production would be
transferred to the company's bakeries in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and
Glasgow. A small depot for 10 vans is to be maintained at the site.
Mr Lally said that the decision to close Dundee had been ''very
distressing''.
He added: ''The Dundee site is the smallest of our operations in
Scotland and the efforts of all of its loyal and valued workforce have,
until now, enabled it to overcome the disadvantages of its size in an
industry which continues to be as competitive as any in food
manufacturing.''

<HEADLINE>Outrage greets 1% pay award Furious nurses may change policy on action as teachers issue warning</HEADLINE>

NURSES' leaders are outraged by their 1% national pay award, while
teaching unions south of the Border are threatening industrial action
because of the effect on jobs and class sizes of their unfunded 2.7%
award.
Unison head of health Bob Abberley condemned the treatment of
Britain's 500,000 nurses as ''an appalling national scandal''. He said
they had been betrayed by the Government with an increase which will
give a staff nurse an insulting #2.17 extra a week.
The union would be launching a major campaign by nurses and the public
to force the Government to offer at least the 2.5% awarded to hospital
doctors.
Mrs Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of
Nursing, said the offer was not enough. Inflation had gone up, average
pay had gone up, and there were growing nursing shortages.
A spokeswoman for the Royal College of Midwives said its members could
be pushed towards withdrawing their goodwill and changing their policy
on industrial action as a result of the pay award.
''It is difficult to believe that the profession which cares for
800,000 women and their babies every year can be treated in such a
mean-minded manner. Two hundred and thirty branches are currently
discussing whether or not to change RCM policy on industrial action and
I fear that this award will be the final straw,'' said Mrs Yvonne
Hewins, director of employment affairs for the RCM.
She added that the Government was showing contempt for women and
women's health care.
Ms Julia Allison, the general secretary of the RCM, expressed her
''total disgust'' over the pay award.
''Morale in midwifery is at an all-time low already and this
scandalous pay award will make things even worse. It will inevitably
lead to job losses and cuts in services,'' she said.
Ms Jocelyn Prudence, of Professions Allied to Medicine, which
represents physiotherapists, radiographers, occupational therapists,
dieticians, chiropodists, and related staff, said the 1% award was
''disastrous, far worse than expected.
''The Government's local pay experiment will set trust against trust
and create divisions among staff. The reality of local pay will be
reduced staff morale, increased costs, and longer hours and less leave
for staff. This is about political dogma, not patient care.''
There was one rule for trust chief executives, who could earn more
than #100,000, and another for those involved in patient care, who once
again were short-changed, she said.
Mr Jim Devine, Unison's senior regional officer in Scotland, said the
pay award was an insult to the country's 70,000 nurses and midwives.
''We totally condemn this penny pay deal, at a time when inflation is
running at 2.9% and is set to rise to 3.5% in April.''
He also criticised the prospect of a further 1.5% being awarded to
staff by hospital trusts on the basis on performance-related pay. This,
said Mr Devine, was a divisive and demoralising tactic.
However, the awards were welcomed by Mr Roy Lilley, of the NHS Trust
Federation, who said trust hospitals could now negotiate locally with
doctors and nurses.
Teaching unions in England and Wales stressed that the lack of extra
cash to fund the 2.7% increase would mean lost teaching jobs and half of
primary school pupils in classes of more than 30 -- many as high as 40.
The National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers said
the award was ''one unfunded settlement too many''. Its executive is to
recommend that its Easter conference authorise industrial action to
protect members faced with ''unreasonable class sizes''.
General secretary Nigel de Gruchy said: ''The demand for action from
our branches over class sizes is becoming irresistible.''
The smaller Association of Teachers and Lecturers also warned of the
danger of industrial action.
However, the biggest teaching union, the National Union of Teachers,
took a more measured line, with general secretary Doug McAvoy saying the
union would not be ''bounced'' into anything which would look like a
''Government victory''.
He said: ''Teachers will be demoralised that once again the Review
Body has toed the Government's line. Its job is to recruit, retain, and
motivate. This award does nothing for motivation.''
The tough Government line was greeted with dismay by local education
authorities, which say services have already been cut to the bone, and
school governors, who now face the responsibility of balancing budgets.
Chairman of the National Governors' Council Simon Goodenough said:
''School governors will be greatly disappointed that the Government has
ignored calls for full funding of the pay award.''
Mr Graham Lane, education chairman of the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities, said: ''This is disastrous. It means LEAs will not be able
to pay this award. There will be teacher redundancies and a dramatic
rise in class sizes.''
Although an education employer, he said: ''I do not blame NASUWT for
talking about industrial action. The award underpays teachers anyway and
the Government is not funding any of it.''

IT WAS not quite as good as Mr Tam Dalyell's famous one-word question
to a Minister -- ''why?'' but Mr Tony Blair still was quite effective
when he simply asked Mr Major yesterday if it was Government's
responsibility to reduce inequality.
Margaret Thatcher, caught in the right mood, might have replied
''no.'' Mr Major said ''yes.''
This produced loud, stagey, surprise ''Ohs'' from the large cast of
Labour extras and a rather shocked silence from the Government back
benches.
Mr Blair, on an each-way winner with that question, was sharp with his
follow-up. Figures showed that Britain was now a more unequal society
than at any time since the Second World War. He bolstered this by
contrasting the head of a privatised utility earning 70 times as much as
a teacher and 100 times as much as a nurse.
Mr Major was forced into a generalised defence of the action his
Government had taken to help those facing the greatest difficulties.
His problem was (a) he was unable to rebut Mr Blair's claim, as Mr
Blair pointed out, and (b) the cheers for his assertion that this was a
caring Government sounded less than convinced.
Mr Blair was ready with his punchline which was that the Government
had created a Britain which was ''divided, inefficient and unjust.'' Mr
Major, perhaps trying to make up for calling him a ''dimwit'' on
Tuesday, conceded ''It's an extremely good sound bite.'' It was not,
however, true.
The Prime Minister was also rather caught on the hop when Mr Clive
Soley (Hammersmith -- Lab.) again asked simply -- simple is best --
whether a single market free trade area did not inevitably imply a
single currency. Mr Major's brief pause seemed as good as a ''yes,'' to
the Opposition benches anyway.
This was all the more embarrassing as the Euro-sceptical wing of the
Tory Party in the persons of Mr Richard Tracey (Surbiton) and Mr
Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) had held the floor, the latter
praising Mr Major's ''robust and realistic'' stand on a single currency.
''There comes a moment when consensus becomes unanimity,'' the Prime
Minister said hopefully. There may well. However, a glance at the
thunderous visages of Sir Edward Heath, Mr Hugh Dykes and other
Europhiles, made clear that the moment had not arrived.
Critical claims that the Commons often conducts itself like an unruly
classroom of schoolboys received some backing when the unfortunate Mr
Ian Bruce (Dorset South -- Con.), trying to commend the virtues of
something in the upper reaches of the communications super-highway
mispronounced the Eurim report on it as what sounded like the ''Urine
report.''
The House was convulsed, especially when poor Mr Bruce tried again and
failed again. He did manage to mention something called ''Super Janet,''
which sounded like a hurricane. Mr Major, laughing as much as any one,
said the report sounded like a jolly good read anyway.
Some of the girls were laughing too, so the fact that the Commons is
no longer a single-sex school does not seem to have done much for its
sense of humour. It was unfortunate though, that it happened the day
after the Speaker had urged Members to make greater use of the richness
of the English language and aim for elegance.

A RAIL union leader yesterday defended Labour's Clause 4 -- but Labour
MP Glenda Jackson, who is sponsored by his union, spoke out for change.
Mr Lew Adams, general secretary of Aslef, said he would not trade off
support for a new constitution in return for a party pledge to
renationalise British Rail.
He emphasised that the union had ''a constitutional bond to the clause
and we are not about to give it up.''
His heart was with Clause 4, which was what Aslef sincerely believed
the party should stand for, and union delegates to Labour's special
conference in April would vote accordingly, he said in the latest issue
of his union journal.
In the same issue, Ms Jackson, the Aslef-sponsored MP for Highgate and
Hampstead, put the case for modernising the party constitution.
A Labour election victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, she
said, adding she would do everything in her power to guarantee a Labour
Government,including supporting Tony Blair and John Prescott in their
campaign to modernise the constitution.
Mr Adams called on the Labour Party to think again about letting the
first rail privatisation franchises run their full course before
passenger services were restored to public ownership.
He welcomed the announcement of a Labour Party working group on
proposals for restoring the railways to public ownership and public
accountability. He said he hoped the party meant what it said and that
it would be full nationalisation,as opposed to just taking the system
back under public control.

A WORK which -- in the words of its composer -- ''wavers between deep
despair, uncertain questioning, and violent appassionato outbursts'' is
quite likely to turn out to be by Kenneth Leighton. For all their
brevity, his Seven Variations Op 43 delivered their emotional message in
by no means uncertain terms at the start of last night's concert by the
new young quartet-in-residence at the Queen's Hall.
Each variation, and each change of mood, was keenly articulated.
Minutes of despair, but also moments of serenity, made their point. The
work may be pocket-sized, but it is one of Leighton's small
masterpieces. Though few people have hailed Chausson's unfinished string
quartet, Op 36, as a masterpiece, it too is a work of wavering moods,
now tender, now drooping. Long neglected by mainstream ensembles, it
proved well worth championing by young players such as these, who could
respond to its refined, sweet-toned, and very French melancholy.
What the many schoolchildren in the audience made of it is anybody's
guess, but from an early age I have loved Chausson's poetic grasp of
musical form, and still do.
The slow movement, a swaying dance, was a special treat -- more so, on
this occasion, than that of Dvorak's American quartet, which failed to
draw from the players the romance it needed. But the 'cellist -- the
only player allowed the luxury of a seat -- phrased ardently, and in the
rest of the work there was a finese that augered well for future
concerts.

THE Broadcasting for Scotland campaign was given a firm endorsement by
National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell last night when he warned
BBC governors to respect BBC Scotland's national cultural identity.
In a Commons debate on the future of the corporation, Mr Dorrell said
he would expect the BBC to ''introduce some precision'' into its policy
on encouraging the production of programmes in Scotland.
He read out from last summer's White Paper, which called on the BBC to
diminish its centralisation in London and to ''take a reasonable
proportion of network production from the nations and regions'' of the
UK.
Mr Dorrell said he agreed with expectations that the BBC respect this
commitment and added: ''I expect the BBC will want to include some
precisions about the nature of this undertaking.''
Campaigners in Scotland have complained that the BBC so far has shown
no willingness to put into practice the Government's call for the BBC to
devolve programme-making away from London and reflect in its output the
totality of British culture beyond the Home Counties.
Last night, Mr Nigel Smith, chairman of the Broadcasting for Scotland
Campaign, welcomed what he described as Mr Dorrell's assurances: ''I
thought it was a fairly strong signal to the BBC. Mr Dorrell has given
us the assurances we have been looking for.''
He added: ''The Government has produced a White Paper which meets many
of our concerns. The BBC response, despite its assurances, has been
cynical, calculated and inadequate.''
The campaign claims that the BBC's decision to relocate #75m worth of
production outside London in response to the White Paper is offset by
the #40m taken from regional programming and #55m in network programmes
centralised from the regions in recent years.
Earlier, the campaign received support from Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang. In a letter to Mr Smith, Mr Lang said he was campaigning within
the Government and the BBC to ensure that broadcasting in Scotland is
encouraged.
Mr Lang said: ''I take a close interest in the future of broadcasting
in Scotland. I have made my views known to my colleagues in Government
and to the Director-General of the BBC.''
Speaking in the debate, Mr Robert Maclennan, MP for Caithness and
Sutherland, said Scottish licence fee-payers had the right to ''hear and
see something of their own lives''.
He said 85% of the BBC's output originated in London, and 97% in
England. Only 3% was made in Scotland and Wales. ''I don't think the
general public is impressed with that distribution.''
Scottish Nationalist MP Mr Andrew Welsh said: ''The BBC is weakening
the loyalty and effectiveness of its Scottish staff, and the impact of
its Scottish output by holding so tightly to the reins of London
control. I believe that an independent, autonomous, Scottish
Broadcasting Company is required, completely free of outside control.''
During the debate, Mr Dorrell reaffirmed the Government commitment to
retaining the licence fee to support the BBC despite the corporation's
increasing commercial activities.
Shadow National Heritage Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the
continuation of the licence fee but criticised the Government's
intention to review it again before the end of 2001.
He demanded: ''Why put us through all the uncertainty all over again?
They could have given a longer-term perspective for the future of the
licence fee.''

FIFTY years later he entertains not the slightest qualm about Dresden.
It was his 21st operation with 166 Squadron of Bomber Command. He was
navigator of one of the 796 Lancaster bombers, taking part in the second
wave attack over the city in the early hours of February 14, 1945. ''We
were fighting for our lives,'' he says.
He talks about Dresden on condition that he is not named. Bomber
Command Association advises its members to refer questions to its
headquarters at RAF Museum, Hendon. ''We all want to keep to the same
line,'' says the navigator.
He was 22 at the time of the attack, a flying officer with two years'
training, an Edinburgh boy who remembered the land-mine in Gorgie that
killed civilians in 1941.
''I remember seeing German bombers streaming up the coast before
turning towards Clydebank. I was huddling in an Anderson Shelter,
thinking that one day I would get my chance of revenge.''
The operation over Dresden was ''routine''. Crews were briefed on the
day of the attack, as was normal procedure. He knew back then that
Dresden was a big city, famous for its cathedrals and its porcelain.
Briefings stressed the target's importance as a large communications
centre, a huge railway junction like Crewe, with troop concentrations
the Russians wanted to prevent moving up to reinforce the Eastern front.
''We were at war,'' he says. ''The war had not been won. The V2s were
being launched on London. The concentration camps were being liberated.
The Battle of the Bulge had not yet been fought.''
Although the operation had been planned meticulously, with elaborate
decoy runs in anticipation of strong German defence, it proved easier.
He remembers heavy flak, although many of the 80mm guns had been
diverted to the Eastern front. The Luftwaffe squadron at Dresden sat out
the whole of the attack on the tarmac. A ''communications breakdown'',
it was later claimed by the Germans.
''It has blurred into all the other operations. I knocked up 30 by the
end of the war. I never knew anything about the firestorm until I read
something in a newspaper two or three days later. When you finish an
operation you just wonder when the next one is coming. You had a duty to
do.
''That's war. Hindsight is a marvellous thing, and with Harris and all
the others now gone, it is easy to criticise. Next they will be blaming
Truman for bombing the Japanese. It couldn't have happened to a nicer
people, as far as I'm concerned, but I've got nothing against the
Germans.''
Bomber Command lost an estimated 56,000 crew over Europe the Second
World War. Records are still being sifted and some of the latest
estimates are put closer to 60,000. The average age of those involved in
the air was 20. Life depended on total trust and loyalty within the
crews of seven in a Lancaster bomber, and that unshakeable esprit de
corps holds even 50 years later, strenghtened perhaps by the denial of a
campaign medal for Bomber Command after the war, the vilification of its
commander-in-chief, Arthur Harris, and his exclusion from the peerage or
earldom that went virtually automatically to other wartime commanders.
Bomber Command veterans still seethe over a sense of ''tremendous
ingratitude'', as Anderson McCormack puts it. A Glasgow boy, he had just
joined 100 Squadron of Bomber Command as a flight engineer, and his
skipper, pilot Sandy Taylor from Inverurie, went out on his first
operation over Dresden with an experienced crew.
''It was just another mission as far as Bomber Command was
concerned,'' he recalls. ''A lot of the aftermath was politically
motivated. Harris took the blame, but the order came from chiefs of
staff, and Dresden must have been discussed by Churchill, Roosevelt and
Stalin at Yalta nine days before. It might have been an operation to
show Joe what Bomber Command was capable of doing. I don't think
Churchill had any love of Stalin.
''Bomber Command has nothing to feel ashamed about. You carried out
your orders or you were branded LMF (Lacking Moral Fibre), which was a
stigma you would carry for life. We were waging total war. There was no
longer such things as civilians or nice cities.''

FORMER Rangers and England footballer Mel Sterland appeared in court
in Sheffield yesterday, in connection with a #63,000 Post Office raid.
The 33-year-old ex-Ranger, who also played for Sheffield Wednesday and
Leeds, was accused of handling a safe and its contents stolen in the
raid.
Mr Sterland, of Carr Lane, Dronfield, near Sheffield, was remanded on
conditional bail for four weeks by the city's magistrates.
Following a burglary at Dore Post Office in Townhead Road, Sheffield,
when a safe containing cash, postal orders, and stamps was stolen,
detectives raided his #250,000 home on the edge of Derbyshire's Peak
District, and he was later arrested.
Mr Sterland -- now player manager of Boston United -- who moved to
Rangers for #800,000 in March 1989, appeared before magistrates charged
with handling stolen goods.
Mr Barry Murdoch, 19, of Hastilar Road South, Manor, and Mr Alan
Wilson, 24, of Fishponds Road West, Manor, both Sheffield, were charged
with burglary and theft of the safe.
Mr Sterland was granted bail on condition that he does not communicate
with any of his co-accused.

BEARSDEN will be bouncing for charity tomorrow night when a team of
teenagers take part in an all-night trampoline session in Westerton
Church Hall, Crarae Avenue, to raise around #500 for the Third World.
Starting at 9.30pm on Saturday until 9.30am on Sunday, 15 teenager
members of Revelation -- the Westerton Church Young People's group --
will trampoline in half-hour sessions all night. This is just one of
many novel projects organised on behalf of World Vision UK, a relief and
development agency, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year.
The main UK event this weekend is the 24 Hours Youth Famine -- an
organised fast which involves thousands of Scottish teenagers. Money
raised will help children in Rwanda, food aid and farming development in
Mozambique, and water and health programmes in Senegal. Last year the
event raised more than #1,480,000.
* Teenagers who want to join the fast can still do so. Ring the
hotline on 01908 841212 or 24 Hour Famine, World Vision, 599 Avenury
Boulevard, Milton Keynes, MK9 3PG.
Modern fling
* SO you think the Highlands are all Scottish country dancing and
ceilidhs? Wrong. Modern dance comes to Elgin next week with the start of
a seven-week series of workshops in contemporary dance styles. To book a
place contact the Moray Leisure Centre, Elgin, or ring 01343-550033.
Giveaway
* A RECURRING grievance among Scottish charities is that they rarely
benefit from UK fund-raising events. For instance when snooker champion
Stephen Hendry won the #300,000 Liverpool Victoria Charity Challenge,
the Down's Syndrome Association netted #100,000. But not a penny comes
to Scotland because the DSA operates only in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
Community
talk-in
* ACCORDING to futurologists like Alvin Toffler, we are all going to
become more involved in our local community in the future, partly
because of unemployment and the development of telecottages -- home
working on computer.
Whatever the reason, local communities are likely to become more, not
less, important in the twenty-first century. Therefore Who Speaks for
Communities?, the subject of a weekend residential school in Pitlochry
(April 18-20) is a well-timed event.
Organised by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations the aim
of the school will be to encourage a dialogue between community groups
and those interested in community development. For further information
ring Eileen Graham, SCVO, 031-556 3882.
Feminine sport
* MACHISMO turns off most women from taking part in sport. But there
is as positive side. Find out more at a one-day conference (to be
launched by Elaine C Smith) which is being organised by the Sports
Council for Glasgow and Women in Sport at Woodside Halls, Glasgow,
February 19. Further information on: 041-227 5933.
Pro-volunteers
* IF voluntary organisations are to compete in the market-place for
volunteers and resources, then they have to become more professional.
Volunteer Development Scotland is organising a series of two-day
courses on Promoting Your Organisation and Recruiting Volunteers. The
first starts on Wednesday, February 22 in Stirling. Cost #40 a day for
members. Further information from Volunteer Development Scotland, 80
Murray Place, Stirling. Phone 01786-479593.
Health and seek
* HOW do you find out about a local self-help group? The answer is,
with difficulty. You can short-circuit the foot-slogging by ringing
Health Search Scotland which provides information on self-help and
voluntary groups.
Set up by the Health Education Board for Scotland, the service is free
and all enquiries are treated in strict confidence. Ring: 0345-708010.
There is an answering machine service outside of normal office hours.
Oxfam chic
* ARMCHAIR shoppers will find plenty to interest them in Oxfam's new
1995 spring-summer catalogue, which offers a range of goodies from
around the world.
Today's Oxfam is chic, cheerful, and sophisticated. Here you will find
fashionable crochet waistcoats from Zimbabwe, colourful shawls from
Guatemala, children's clothes from El Salvador, along with Nepalese and
Indian picnic rugs. To get your catalogue ring 0869-245011.
Art school Turks
* MAKE a point next week of popping into Glasgow School of Art to see
the exhibition of Anatolian nomadic weavings in the Mackintosh Building.
Part of a collection built up by Maya Brisley, some bought directly from
tribes in Anatolia. The exhibition, which runs until March 3, also
includes tent hangings and nomadic jewellery, and various bags. Items
are for sale and prices start at a fairly modest #50.

TWENTY-four hours after describing train and bus users as ''dreadful
human beings'' Transport Minister Steven Norris found himself rubbing
shoulders with them yesterday.
After a day mostly spent insisting to the media that his remarks on
the attractiveness of the motor car were taken out of context, the
under-fire Minister found himself on a crowded InterCity from Stockport
to London -- and travelling second class, at that.
Earlier, the Prime Minister went to the defence of Mr Norris,
insisting in the Commons that his comments had been ''widely
misinterpreted''.
The day had started for the 49-year-old Minister -- a former car
salesmanwith a shuttle flight to Manchester for two engagements in
Oldham and Stockport.
The top-of-the-range chauffeured Vauxhall Omega V6 that had swept him
on his way from the airport was pounced on eagerly by photographers, as
if it proved a point.
Mr Norris insisted that letting the train take the strain on his
return journey had been organised nearly two weeks ago.
''I don't have to stage these things. I think that would be frankly
pathetic,'' he said.
The posse of photographers, with whom Mr Norris kept up a good-natured
banter, got off the train at Macclesfield, minutes down the line. Surely
now the Minister would move to the airy, uncrowded spaces of the first
class, lunch if required?
However, in second class he stayed, in his window seat, back to the
engine, working on his ministerial papers on a table shared with his
private secretary, a businessman and Great Ormond Street Hospital
haemotology consultant. Other passengers looked on in bewilderment.
The Minister methodically worked his way through his pile of papers --
a box and a half, he said later.
He paused briefly for a cup of coffee and a chocolate bar somewhere in
the Midlands and chatted occasionally with his fellow travellers.
''They are fine, delightful,'' said the Minister. ''I always make the
point that I am one of these passengers. On a journey like this it would
be crazy to use the car.''
And yes, he said, he had got a first-class ticket, but had not used
it.

THE Defence Secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, is expected to make a
statement in the Commons today after demanding the resignation of Air
Chief Marshal Sir Sandy Wilson in a face-to-face confrontation.
During the heated exchange in the Secretary of State's office on the
sixth floor of the Ministry of Defence, Mr Malcolm Rifkind made it clear
he had lost all confidence in the four-star officer, who has a salary of
#95,000.
The unprecedented move follows an independent investigation into the
expenditure of #387,000 on refurbishing Sir Sandy's official residence
at Hames Garth, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
A #100,000 report by Ms Sheila Master of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick
has concluded that no single person could be held responsible for the
expenditure, which included #60,000 on curtains, carpets, and interior
design.
However, there is criticism of Sir Sandy's lack of judgment and Mr
Rifkind is understood to have told him there was no longer confidence in
his abilities as a top-level budget holder, responsible for a
multi-million pound expenditure.
Sir Sandy was understood to have asked to see Mr Rifkind after details
of the report and accusations appeared in a national newspaper, after
what is believed to be a leak from high-level political sources.
Sir Sandy met Mr Rifkind at the MoD late yesterday afternoon.
The RAF is furious at Sir Sandy's treatment and senior officers have
pledged to support him, if attempts were made to make him a
''scapegoat''.
However Mr Rifkind's insistence that he no longer has confidence in
him makes his position untenable.
Sir Sandy is known to be angry that he has been unable to speak out
publicly on the issue.
He is believed to be keen for the Commons Defence Committee to hold an
inquiry into the affair.
Mr David Clark, the Shadow Defence Secretary, said: ''It's wrong to
make a scapegoat of Sandy Wilson.
''He may have made errors but the real responsibility lies with the
Secretary of State who has failed -- despite repeated warnings -- to
implement a proper financial control regime. We identified waste of over
#5000m in recent years.''

AN Englishman called English with a degree in English who wrote for a
job in Scotland has lost a racial discrimination claim -- that he was
turned down because he was English.
Yesterday, an industrial tribunal which heard 31-year-old Robert
English's case last month came out unanimously in favour of Alness
Citizens' Advice Bureau.
Middlesbrough-born Mr English said he was upset at the decision, but
intended to appeal.
He said the experience had not put him off living in the Highlands,
although he intended to stay in his present job in Wales.
Mr English had applied to the CAB for a welfare rights officer
vacancy.
He explained: ''I don't like England. It is too crowded. I like the
quality of life in Scotland.''
Mr English said he thought he had a good chance of landing the job
because of his qualifications and the low salary, which he thought would
deter others.
''I got my degree at Stirling University and fell in love with
Scotland. I was very keen to return.''
But as the date for interviews approached, Mr English had received no
contact from the CAB, so he phoned them.
He taped the conversation with CAB manager Alan Byron, who said: ''Oh
Bob, we thought you might not like it up here, only stay a little while,
and we would be faced with the bother of re-advertising and looking for
someone else.''
Mr English said he was annoyed at the ''absurd'' attitude, because he
was better qualified than other candidates.
Mr Byron denied that the CAB discriminated against Mr English. The job
was offered to a Glasgow man, but he turned it down, and it eventually
went to an Alness man.
In its findings, the tribunal said Mr English was one of 16 applicants
for the post. Ten of these, including Mr English, were not interviewed
for the job. Of the six who did get interviews two were English.
They said there was no difference in the arrangements which the CAB
made to decide which of the 16 should be offered employment.
However, the tribunal said some of Mr English's criticisms about the
CAB's procedures were well founded.
Mr Byron was not available for comment yesterday.

THREE Glasgow MPs have called for work on the controversial M77
extension to be halted to allow a reassessment of the environmental
impact of the road.
The Labour MPs, who represent constituencies directly affected by the
motorway extension, yesterday urged Strathclyde Regional Council and the
Scottish Office to instruct the contractors to halt the work.
They claimed that the environmental impact of the extension on local
communities had not been properly explored.
Mr Ian Davidson (Glasgow Govan), Mr Mike Watson (Glasgow Central) and
Mr Jimmy Dunnachie (Glasgow Pollok), made the call after the contractors
Wimpey had rejected a similar demand to delay construction work, until
the European Commission had considered a complaint that Strathclyde
region had failed to conduct an environmental impact assessment in
accordance with EU law.
Wimpey told the MPs that a written question on the matter had been
answered by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Roads Minister, in
the House of Commons on January 23 and said that any further questions
should be referred to the Scottish Secretary.
Speaking during a visit to part of the planned route in Corkerhill
yesterday, Mr Davidson conceded that Strathclyde region and the Scottish
Office might not be legally-bound to halt the work, because European
legislation came into effect after a public inquiry into the extension
in 1988.
However, he said he believed they were morally obliged to do so.
Mr Davidson denied that the MPs' move might embarrass the controlling
Labour group on Strathclyde region, which supported the M77 extension.
The MPs' call was welcomed by Corkerhill Community Council.
Its secretary, Councillor Walter Morrison, warned that fumes, from the
53,000 vehicles which would use the extension each day, would increase
the level of illness, in an area where the rate of respiratory illness
is 50% higher than the Glasgow average.
Councillor Charlie Gordon, chairman of the region's roads and
transportation committee, said later that work on the project would not
be halted.
He said a full environmental study, which exceeded all European and UK
standards, was carried out before the planning application was
submitted.

<HEADLINE>Interferon trial results receive a cautious welcome Drug tests give MS victims ray of hope</HEADLINE>

A NEW drug which can slow the progress of multiple sclerosis, a
crippling disease affecting one in 1000 people, may be available in
Britain later this year.
The makers of Interferon Beta, already in use in America, are hoping
to have approval from the European Licensing Authority in the summer.
Ironically, the Scots doctor whose pursuit of Interferon in the cause
of cancer victims led to his professional downfall may be among the
beneficiaries of the new treatment.
Dr Tom McAllister, the former consultant microbiologist at Yorkhill
Hospital in Glasgow -- who was struck off by the GMC three years ago for
diverting charity money to his Interferon Fund -- suffers from MS or
something akin to it.
''I will be watching developments with interest -- if it looks like
working out I will try it myself,'' he said yesterday. ''It would be
ironic -- I never dreamt when I started campaigning to make Interferon
available back in 1980 that I might be using it myself one day, but
things happen that way.''
British experts welcomed the development yesterday, but pointed out
that promising trial results on Interferon and another drug,
Copolymer-1, had to be treated with caution.
The trials show Interferon to work best on patients with relapsing and
remitting MS -- the most common form -- but its usefulness in patients
with chronic, progressive MS remains to be seen.
The Multiple Sclerosis Society also pointed out that, while no serious
side-effects of Interferon have emerged, the effects of long-term use
are an unknown quantity.
However, one of the biggest stumbling blocks could be the cost.
Schering Health Care denied reports that their drug could cost
#8000-#9000 per patient a year.
On that basis, according to a press release accompanying this week's
British Medical Journal, treating just half the 60,000 UK sufferers
would cost the NHS the equivalent of 0.7% of its annual budget. The
company could not say how much Interferon would cost.
In the USA, the cost is about #40 a vial, used once every two days, so
the annual cost there is nearly #6600 per patient.
Nevertheless, the possibility of the first effective drug for MS is
the news that sufferers like Mrs Moira Copeland, 44, from Balornock,
Glasgow, have been waiting for.
Mrs Copeland has fought against MS for 17 years, as she developed
failing eyesight, incontinence and weakened muscle. She fell and broke
her thigh last year and her leg had to be amputated. Yesterday she was
in Canniesburn Hospital for plastic surgery to the stump.
''Moira is a fighter -- she tells me she is looking forward to coming
home and getting stuck into the housework,'' said her husband, Robert,
45. ''The reality is she will need a wheelchair. They are going to give
her an artificial leg but it will be purely cosmetic -- her other leg is
too weak for her to start walking again.''
Mr Copeland, who gave up his job as a joiner eight years ago to nurse
his wife, said: ''Her eyes lit up last year when her neurologist told
her there was a new drug expected in 1995. It would be wonderful if
something could be done for people who are suffering like Moira.''
Dr McAllister was hopeful yesterday that the price of Interferon would
come down when it went into wide-scale distribution and the development
costs recouped, but Schering warned that it wasn't as simple as that.
''It is a very complex and expensive process, and that doesn't stop
once initial production is under way, and the drug also has to be kept
refrigerated all the time,'' said a spokesman.
Multiple sclerosis -- which is particularly prevalent in some parts of
North-east Scotland and the Northern Isles -- happens when a rogue
immune response strips the myelin sheath from the nerves; this results
in scarring and affects the nerve's ability to activate physical
functions.
According to an editorial in the BMJ, the trials so far show that
Interferon Beta-1B, the Schering product, produced a lower rate of
relapse than in patients taking a placebo.
However, this did not demonstrate an effect on disability, but another
test designed to show such an effect, using a rival product, showed a
delay in deterioration.
Professor Ian McDonald of the National Hospital for Neurology and
Neurosurgery in London said that the trials gave cause for optimism, but
caution was still necessary.
MS Society spokesman David Harrison said: ''We would not call this a
breakthrough in the headline sense, but it is encouraging. If it is
shown to work then our view is that any patient who could benefit should
receive it on an equitable basis, given the way NHS funding is allocated
-- whether you get the treatment or not should not depend on what part
of the country you happen to live in.''

<TEXT>
THE average council house rent in Edinburgh is to rise from April, by
#1.85p a week, around 5%, the district council agreed yesterday.
The increase was voted through by the city's minority Labour
administration with SNP support, despite a Tory attempt to freeze the
#35.44p a week average bill. Edinburgh tenants already pay among the
highest charges in Scotland.
Councillor Mary Mulligan, Labour's housing convener, said more than
half the increase was due to interest charges on money borrowed to pay
for modernisation and repairs.
The council received no help with housing costs from the Government
and was not allowed to use council tax payments. These restrictions
meant all the housing services had to be paid for from rents, she said.
Councillor David Manson, the Tory spokesman, said that rents under
Labour had tripled in eight years.

WIMPEY, the contractors on the controversial M77 extension in Glasgow,
yesterday found a new and somewhat unlikely antagonist in the BBC.
While it has usually found itself head to head with environmental
objectors, the group yesterday squared up to BBC Scotland which it
claims was responsible for an incident it ''should take no credit for''.
In a letter to The Herald, Mr Iain McConnell, Wimpey's director of
corporate relations, said a BBC cameraman looking for action to film for
Reporting Scotland had given a lift in his car on Tuesday to one of the
regular protesters.
He said: ''She had chains round her waist. He then drove straight to
one of our vehicles where she jumped out and chained herself to the
vehicle.
''The cameraman then filmed the young lady screaming and shouting
while she was being removed to safety and the footage was shown on the
programme.
''This surely must be inflammatory and against the good and fair
judgment of our broadcasters.''
Mr McConnell went on to say that BBC activities, such as the one he
had described, only helped to increase tension at the road works.
''While we appreciate that the media has a duty to report on news and
matters of interest to the general public, surely the facts should be
reported in a fair and balanced way.
''We have today received an apology from the BBC for the incident and,
while we will continue to co-operate with all the media, we ask them all
to act in a responsible and fair way.''
Last night the BBC said the cameraman in question had been spoken to
about the incident. The spokesman said: ''No further action is being
taken.''
He added the cameraman had not been aware the woman was wearing chains
because she had been wearing a bulky jacket.
He said: ''Since the incident, BBC staff have been reminded not to do
anything which calls into question the BBC's commitment to
impartiality.''

<HEADLINE>Top civil servants get largest award.    Nurses to bear brunt of public pay deal</HEADLINE>

SENIOR civil servants are set to win pay increases of hundreds of
pounds a week while nurses are being held to below inflation rises, in
public sector pay recommendations approved by the Cabinet yesterday.
As angry union leaders contemplated strike action, Mr Andrew Smith,
the Shadow Chief Secretary, said: ''It is a disgrace that the
Government's decision means a nurse could get as little as #3 more
before tax a week, while top ranking civil servants could get more than
#600 a week extra.''
Government sources pointed out that, for the first time, the people at
the top of the civil service are to be paid by results, determined by a
new review body which will be able to recommend salaries ranging between
#90,000 and #150,000.
A spokesman conceded that no-one was likely to get a pay cut.
At present, the highest paid is Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robin Butler,
on #118,000. However, it is possible that high achievers from private
industry, whom the Government is interested in recruiting as Permanent
Secretaries to run individual departments, may command higher salaries
than the man who is their boss.
A Government spokesman said the pay recommendations for nurses and
other medical staff, doctors and dentists, teachers, and the armed
forces -- in all about 1.3 million workers -- were made by expert review
bodies who assessed the increases necessary to ''recruit, motivate, and
retain'' the staff needed.
The recommended awards are mostly in the 2-3% range, and have to be
financed from efficiency savings for the third year running, bringing
allegations from the Opposition, local authority, and union spokesmen
that around 10,000 teachers may have to be sacked by local councils
unable to meet the bill for their present workforce.
The Prime Minister rejected this in the Commons, saying that education
authorities needed to study their priorities carefully. Ministers are
satisfied that the great majority need not cut staff, if they make
economies in other areas and use reserves they have built up.
The Labour leader Tony Blair complained that the Government was doing
nothing about a situation in which pay increases for heads of privatised
utilities which were running at 70 times that of teachers and 100 times
that of nurses.
Later, Mrs Ann Taylor, the Shadow Leader of the House, said that
possible 20% increases for top civil servants contrasted with the low
single-figure rises for everyone else.
''How strange that the new pay scale should come out on the very day
that the Prime Minister was forced by Tony Blair to concede that it is
the Government's responsibility to reduce inequality in Britain. How
hypocritical.''
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: ''The
top people are getting a pay bonus, probably for sacking their own
staff, while the infantry face a triple whammy of an actual pay cut, tax
increases, and interest rate rises.
''Next month, inflation is expected to rise to 3.5%, yet no public
sector employee will get a rise of more than 3.2%.''
Local pay deals are being expanded for nurses and some consultants,
which pleased Ministers but brought angry criticism from Mrs Margaret
Ewing, the SNP Parliamentary leader.
She said that, while the basic 1% increase was ''an insult to
nurses'', regional variations would put great pressure on the NHS.
''A nurse in Lerwick is as valuable as a nurse in London or Glasgow;
national standards demand national and decent pay.''
The nurses, midwives, and other health staff have a 1% national
increase, which local pay agreements could raise to between 1.3% and 3%.
Doctors and dentists get 2.5%, with GPs averaging 3%.
Teachers get 2.7%. Civil servants under Permanent Secretary rank get
2.5%, senior armed forces officers between 2.5% and 3.8%, and judges
2.5%.

SUSPICIONS about bugging devices yesterday made a Sinn Fein delegation
call off talks in Belfast with senior civil servants.
A scanning device used by the delegation to check for listening
devices picked up a signal from office equipment in one of Sinn Fein's
rooms at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, just before the two sides were
due to sit down.
The area was sealed off and police were called to begin a search after
Mr Martin McGuinness, leader of the Sinn Fein delegation, and Mr Quinton
Thomas, head of the Government's team, agreed to postpone the session.
Last night, to Sinn Fein scepticism, police announced that no device
had been found. It now seems likely that the scanner will have to be
examined for faults.
At the same time it was confirmed that the two sides had been in
contact to try to agree a new date for re-arranged talks, but it is not
clear if they will go ahead at the same venue.
The Northern Ireland Office said any implication that the Sinn Fein
rooms were being monitored on behalf of the Government was without
foundation.
Downing Street also gave a ''categorical assurance'' that no device
had been planted in the room by anyone acting with the authority of the
Government.
The party's president, Mr Gerry Adams, said: ''This appears to me to
be potentially a very serious matter, but we are trying to resolve it.''
The two sides had planned three hours of exploratory talks dealing
chiefly with Sinn Fein's demands for the early release of prisioners.
But before the sixth session could even start, it was halted when Mr
McGuinness was called aside by a party official who had been using a
scanner in a routine sweep for electronic bugs in one of the private
Stormont rooms set aside for the delegation.
It had picked up a strong signal.
The Sinn Fein leader said: ''The advice from my security team was that
there was a listening device in the room.''
Mr Thomas was then called in, and according to Mr McGuinness he agreed
there was a signal. They then agreed to a postponement.
Mr McGuinness added: ''It is of the utmost importance that these
meetings are conducted in a manner which all sides can feel secure. When
we are satisfied that this is the case, the talks can resume.''

TORY pressures on the Government built up last night, despite a plea
from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who said that a single currency was not
a ''huge step on the path to a Federal Europe''.
More than 100 Tory back benchers have signed a Commons protest motion
rejecting the principle of a single currency for the European Union.
The Labour Party claimed that the keynote speech of Mr Clarke and the
Tory back-bench reaction merely highlighted the deep divisions in the
Government and the Tory Party. The Liberal Democrats are staging a
debate in the Commons next week to emphasise these divisions.
Mr Clarke, one of the Cabinet's chief supporters of the European
Union, pulled back from itemising new conditions for Britain signing up
for a single currency which the Tory rebels believe would bring an end
to British sovereignty. He merely repeated stipulations already
encompassed in the controversial Maastricht Treaty.
''The Maastrict Treaty refers to indicators required to overcome
deep-seated structural differences within Europe's economies.
The existing framework for monetary union under a single currency is
still unclear, he said, as are the precise roles that a European central
bank might play. He said: ''There is not a snowball's chance in Hades of
Europe embarking successfully on economic and monetary union in 1997.''
The Chancellor is striving, like the Prime Minister, to keep the
option of a single currency open for Britain some time before the end of
the century.
However, this infuriates the Tory back benchers who tabled a Commons
motion last night which is attracting widespread support. It was
carefully worded to maximise support among Euro-sceptics.
Signatories include six former Cabinet Ministers -- Mr Norman Lamont,
Mr Kenneth Baker, Mr John Biffen, Mr Tom King, Mr David Howell, and Mr
Paul Channon. Eight of the nine Tory back benchers who have been exiled
from the party also signed.
The Chancellor is back by the City and industry in his view that the
Prime Minister should not be pushed by the Tory sceptics into making a
decision about a single currency. Mr Clarke spoke last night in his
speech to the European Movement Gala Dinner in London of ''knee-jerk
reactions that mention of the single currency all too often generates''.
These views are far too simplistic, he said. ''It is quite possible to
have monetary union without political union. It is a mistake to believe
that monetary union need be a huge step on the path to a Federal
Europe.''
Mr Clarke added: ''Britain and Ireland enjoyed a de facto monetary
union for some 50 years after Irish independence. And there are even
examples of political union without monetary union. Scotland retained
its own currency in some form for over 200 years after James VI of
Scotland became James I of England.
He went on to declare that the debate on the benefits or otherwise of
a single European Union currency and a Central Bank ''should be free of
rancour and ridiculous suggestions that those who believe that there may
be circumstances in which it is in our interests to join a single
currency are somehow committed to a European super state''.
