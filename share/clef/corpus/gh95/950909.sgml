Monkjack, Jack Bruce (CMP)
* Supported by his own concise piano playing and Bernie Worrell's
apposite Hammond organ, Bruce showcases his magnificent voice across the
full range of expression from roaring, pleading blues to the nigh on
hymnal. The aptly titled Tightrope is a typically fearless performance
from an artist who has never been afraid to take risks, which this time
pay off handsomely.
Tamburello, Peter King (Miles Music)
* Best known as a lucid keeper of Charlie Parker's alto saxophone
flame, King features here in impressively expansive mood, easing both
alto and soprano through arrangements of Purcell, Gershwin and Bartok,
confident ballads as well as his own blazingly em
otional tribute to racing driver Ayrton Senna, the scene of whose
death the title refers to.

Jazzin' the Blues -- 18 Cool Jazz Moods, Various (Music Club)
* THIS excellent compilation is as interesting to the jazz connoisseur
as to the lay listener, and far superior to any previous collection of
''jazz moods''. The 76 minutes include such unfamiliar delights as Gerry
Mulligan's sumptuous Laura, Thelonious Monk's surprisingly fluid take on
Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers' funky Whisper
Not. Other not-so-obvious, but inspired, choices are the Al Cohn and
Zoot Sims duet of East of the Sun and Chet Baker's hauntingly
contemplative Over the Rainbow.
En Concert, Gerry Mulligan and the Concert Jazz Band (Europe1)
* ANOTHER great buy. This time a double CD-long recording of a superb
concert given by the celebrated Concert Jazz Band in Paris, in November
1960. Among the starry line-up are tenor man Zoot Sims, trombonist Bob
Brookmeyer, trumpeter Conte Candoli and drummer Mel Lewis. Go wild with
the audience over the exhilaratingly swinging versions of You Took
Advantage of Me and Moten Swing; and the sulky, atmospheric Black
Nightgown and Barabra's Theme from the noir film I Want to Live. This
was clearly a night to remember -- even if you weren't there.

Schumann: Dichterliebe, Wolfgang Holzmair (Philips)
* AUSTRIAN baritone Holzmair gave one of the most committed Queen's
Hall recitals in the recent Edinburgh Festival. Every number was
delivered with theatrical and almost operatic intensity -- in yer face
recital singing. That intensity suffuses a beautiful new recording of
Schumann's great song cycle on A Poet's Love -- rich baritone warmth and
a light, high tenor quality of voice. Spellbinding singing enforced by
the cool, clear pianism of Imogen Cooper. Disc also includes the
Liederkreis cycle and other settings of poems by Heinrich Heine
Schumann Piano Works: Maria Joao Pires (DG)
* ONE of the outstanding performances at the Edinburgh Festival was by
the elfin, skelf-like Portuguese pianist, Maria Joao Pires, she of the
fragile, little-girl-lost look, and the muscles of tempered steel. The
work with which she tore into her festival programme -- Robert
Schumann's typically schizophrenic, ultra-poetic and turbulent Three
Romances, features on this superb new disc, which also includes the
Forest Scenes, the Arabeske, and the Carnival from Vienna. Stunning
pianism of great insight. A must for collectors.

An anti-nuclear protester was charged with breach of the peace
yesterday after the Prime Minister went on a walkabout in St Andrews.
Mrs Patricia Robertson,45, had been holding banners against nuclear
testing with her husband David and daughters June,15,and Sarah,11.
The couple claim radioactive isotopes given to Mrs Robertson in
pregnancy caused ill-health in one of their daughters.
Police moved in as the family allegedly sought to get near Mr Major.
After angry scenes, Mrs Robertson was taken to a police van.
A police spokesman said last night she had been charged with breach
of the peace and that a report was being sent to the procurator
-fiscal
at Cupar in Fife.

Televison's Cracker has been responsible for more controversial column
inches than any other police series. Stephen McGinty goes on set to find
out why the crowds cry out for more
McGovern writes in blood . . . Those scripts are absolutely sacred, so
you give all you've got
THE corpse is getting cold and he doesn't like it, not since it
started raining and the blood from his throat wound began running along
his neck. He can hardly feel it and can see even less -- the halogen
lights erected to illuminate the murder scene are too bright. In this
woodland bowl the four-man forensic team in white-hooded boilersuits are
brilliant angels, firing random bursts from their flash-guns.
If only he'd had a gun, no, the bitch would still have nailed him.
They say sex in the nineties is a dangerous deed, deadly at times, but
those times come years later, proceeded by a long illness. Not
immediately. God! Killed by a lab technician, a lassie, with photos to
prove it, hundreds of bloody photos. Soon he was rising through the
white shroud, above the coppers in their wellingtons and Persil whites.
Rising higher over the treetops, his view increased with his last
thought: Who were the men in woolly bunnets and anoraks, reversing the
roles and telling the police what to do, where to stand, what to say?
What was the point of the bigger cameras and doing this again, and
again, and again? Wouldn't it take all night?
Dead men don't lie.
It does take from dusk 'til dawn for just four minutes of Cracker, the
Bafta award-winning drama series starring Robbie Coltrane, to be shot
here in Hulton Estate, Atherton. It's a 30-minute drive from Granada
Studios in Manchester, less if you're in Robbie's Jaguar,
chauffeur-driven by Les, which we're not. No, it's after nine o'clock
when we arrive at a caravan line, tucked away in the country park, like
a new-age squat.
Jealous jokes are often cracked at the size of a star's location
caravan. As if it would be preferable for the man you've just handed #1
million to in part exchange for 15 million viewers, to slum out a
six-month shoot in a tent to prove a political point. Still, Robbie's is
a beauty, a huge Cobra mobile home with a canopy and striped umbrella.
I was drawing a sketch of it, when Coltrane climbed out, accused me of
being a trainspotter, with a black and blue cagoule and pen poised. I
might have seen inside had actor Ricky Tomlinson, alias DC Wise, handed
me over when Coltrane later stuck his head through the window of the
lads' smaller caravan, inquiring in a Mexican accent: ''How much for the
boy? Hand him over and the rest can go free.''
Later we talk about our mutual acquaintance Eddie ''Fitz'' Fitzgerald.
''He hasn't got much better,'' says Robbie. ''He's still a rocky old
ride, him and Panhandle are a mess because of the rape and he's back
with his wife who has had a new baby. Guys like that are all right as
long as you don't fall in love with them and I wouldn't fall in love
with him.''
Earlier in the evening through a steady drizzle director Tim Fywell is
co-ordinating a scene where Fitz and the crew of coppers take in the
view from the bridge on to the corpse. It's the third story in the
series and was written by last year's producer, Paul Abbott.
Temple (to Wise): ''It's him. John Branaghan. Identical MO.''
Then he hands Fitz a university pass of the corpse in better days.
Fitz: ''Pure bloody waste.''
Wise (to Temple): ''You were fast?''
Temple looks towards a devastated woman sitting in the back of a squad
car, being comforted by a WPC.
Temple: ''Her husband took the dog for a walk. Couple of hours and he
didn't come home, she phoned the locals. The dog led 'em down there.
Massive injuries, he only died a couple of minutes ago. Judging by the
tyre tracks. I assume we connect them?''
Wise: ''Well, it's not the M62, is it?''
THIS will be the third and final series of Cracker, with only the
tenuous idea of a Christmas Cracker or major movie to help fans of
Britain's most popular cop show cope. Since its first screening two
years ago, the psychodrama with the emphasis on why-dunnit has been a
world-leader, sold to 27 countries and responsible for more
controversial column-inches than any drama since The Singing Detective.
The last series, which culminated in the rape of DC Penhaligon, played
by Geraldine Somerville, by her colleague Beck launched a word storm of
leaders and articles calling for on-screen sex and violence to be
reassessed. This was before the final image of Penhaligon astride Beck
forcing a revolver into his open mouth could be screened.
The writing is the key to Cracker's success, and Jimmy McGovern is the
enigma machine, rattling out a vision of real life which has never
before been transmitted. Though producer Gub Neal made the initial pitch
of a ''town marshal with a pocket full of Jung'' to Network Centre,
McGovern was the writer to stand him tall.
In the producer Hilary Bevan Jones's office a preview of the first 20
minutes of the series is shown. Prostitution is a theme which will snake
through the next three hours. A woman risks Aids to satisfy a man's
desire for sex in a ''school-girl'' fashion while her own kids lie awake
in another room. He's unable to pay her as his wife has lifted money
from his wallet to pay the milk-man. She threatens to tell his wife,
unless he pays.
A brutal murder is the result.
Six months have passed since Penhaligon's rape and Beck has refused to
admit his guilt. Fitz visits him in an attempt to elicit a confession,
but ends up nutting him. The tone is so dark that if you could adjust
the colour on your television you would. It's as if Jimmy McGovern has
tiptoed down the darkest of corridors beckoning an audience of 15
million people to follow, watch, and learn.
On set Ricky Tomlinson, a close friend of McGovern, explains the
success.
''I'll tell you why they tune in, it's the f**kin' writing, it's A1. I
love McGovern. I think he's great. I just spent a lovely long weekend
with him in Dublin and we laughed from when we arrived on Friday, 'til
we f**kin' missed the boat on the Monday . . .
''What they've done here is tackled rape with the black guy, rape with
the policeman, soccer hooliganism and Hillsborough, all very, very
controversial but not gratuitous. And it was all boiled down to people,
personalities and defects.
''He's so courageous, Jimmy McGovern. McGovern writes in blood. He
f**kin's writes with his heart . . . Those scripts are absolutely
sacred. He writes those with blood so you f**kin' give all you've got.
He must have sweated for hours over them.''
Over a pint in an Edinburgh bar Jimmy McGovern talks, not about using
a hospital drip to oil his typewriter keys but big themes, meaty scenes,
and lighting the touch-paper to controversy. When talking he seems
fearless, as you would expect of the man who told Robbie Coltrane at
their first meeting: ''I wrote the script and I want you to know that I
see Fitz as a very thin man''.
''Cracker is basically about a lack of faith,'' McGovern says. ''At
the time of writing it in England there was a total lack of faith in
anything. I was old-fashioned and I was really fascinated by the
Catholic faith, psychology, conscience, what motivated people. In
political terms everything we've put our faith in, for men of my
generation, was shown to be lies.
''That left religion or in-depth examination of self, the
contemplation of self and what actually drives you. An examination of
conscience. That is like a grandiose claim, but I think it comes from
that, from a post-ideology nineties, when nothing else matters except:
what made you do that?
''Forget about the bullshit. Why? In a way it's a kick-back against
the Agatha Christies and Ruth Rendells hich was very intellectual.
Murder took place in middle-class drawing-rooms and entertained us all
on cold winter nights. And you didn't see the blood, snot, and grief it
caused people. Cracker shows the blood, snot, and grief.''
Yet it's not laugh-free. A scene already shot shows Penhaligon posing
as a prostitute in a bid to trap a killer. A punter seems keen but is
warned away by her. He asks what she's waiting for: ''She says a
well-known popular novelist. But then between the writing and the
shooting we've had the Hugh Grant affair, so I'm saying can we dub it,
so it's a well-known popular actor.''
AFTER midnight the lead cast have retired to their flats, hotels, and
beds and director Tim Fywell is rewinding time in the way television
does, to film the disposal of the corpse they've just found. Actress
Emily Joyce has changed her Charlie's Angels T-shirt for a murderess
outfit of polythene bags over her shoes and a dark coat. A stuntman is
reversing a van to the edge of the slope from which the corpse should
fly out, rolling down the hill.
Inside the van are two lads whose job it is to heave the corpse -- a
plastic mannequin wrapped in a sheet -- out through the back doors. One
take, two take, three take, four. Then a few more for good measure as
the lads strain to launch it a reasonable distance, from which it can
roll down by the burn. Then Emily is called in.
She walks over to the edge of the drop and peers down at her
handiwork. The corpse is lying nestling among grass and mud. It's
beginning to get colder as the director shouts ''Cut!'' and the rain,
which stopped earlier, begins to fall again.
* Cracker will return to ITV on October 16.

* THE last time I cut my finger slicing aubergines, an oath sprang to
by lips but miraculously stayed inside. Some advice from A Book of
Edwardian Etiquette, published in 1902, swam through my subconscious
like an admonishing eel.
''Next to tact,'' it said, ''a calm, easy manner is absolutely
necessary to the attainment of the air of good breeding. Avoid all
affectations and tricks of speech or manner. Do not gesticulate a great
deal, or throw yourself about in your chair.''
The moment passed. ''Oath!'' I roared, specifying a form of excrement,
simultaneously throwing myself about in the chair and gesticulating a
good deal. The dog, which is better bred than me in any case and has a
slip of paper to prove it, watched me with puzzled disdain.
Accidents in the home are too numerous to be amusing; also they can be
sore, or worse. All this I thought while sucking my finger and looking
for a plaster. I couldn't help pondering, though, that another book on
etiquette was long overdue, say ''How to Comport Ones-Self in Moments of
Domestic Adversity.'' It's time to move on from the rules governing the
leaving of calling cards (even the dog doesn't seem to have read that
chapter), what one should do with the stones in a cherry tart, or how to
negotiate a graceful inclination of the head.
Of course there were no plasters where they should have been. Never
are. The hunt, beginning in the bathroom cabinet and going via the
drawer where everyone keeps their giveaway promotional key-rings and
dried-up ball-points, gave plenty of time to sketch in some
chapter-heads for this up-to-date manual.
On Failing to Secure the Top of One's Food-Mixer and Being Sprayed
with Tomato Pulp: Self-possession and sang-froid, cultivated with great
care at the laundrette or other social situation, are of inestimable
value to you here . . .
Upon Accidentally Breaking a Glass Door with One's Elbow Whilst
Bopping to the Phonograph: This form of incident is distressingly
common, even in polite circles. After apologising to the company, and to
the butler who was attempting to gain entry with a tray of sherry, one
should . . .
Receiving Guests Whilst Lying on a Trolley in the Corridor at Accident
and Emergency: Maintaining dignified good humour under circumstances of
notable difficulty is a true sign of the . . .
The plasters were in the tin marked ''Flour''. Now I come to think of
it, that's where they usually are. I counted my fingers: all present and
correct. That time, I was among the lucky ones.

* WARDROBES aren't easy to get excited about. Functional, but rarely
pleasing, they usually take up much-needed floor space, gather dust and
rarely hold everything you want to put in them.
The failure of Victorian tenement builders to include built-in
wardrobes (but still provide generous box rooms) has always been a
mystery -- even today they are not necessarily included as a standard
item in new houses. Regrettably, without such functional concessions,
you are faced with having to include one of these upright boxes as part
of your bedroom suite.
And if you are furnishing on a budget, you could find purchase of a
wardrobe expensive. The days when you could nip along to the saleroom
and find a bargain are gone -- those large Victorian mahogany fitted
wardrobes that were being burned in the Fifties because no one wanted
them, are now much treasured -- especially by the Germans. And the
fitted ones can cost four figures.
Aside from hanging your clothes on an assortment of pegs, the cheapest
alternative to sorting your best suit/dress/shirt is to try to concoct a
wardrobe of your own. A piece of dowling fitted across a corner and
under a shelf won't give you much hanging space but at least, when
curtained off, it keeps the dust away and doesn't take up much room.
An alcove in your bedroom is a wonderful asset because it gives you an
ideal starting point for some DIY. Stanley, whose wardrobe fitments can
be bought through B&amp;Q, offer a selection of mirror or panel doors which
slide on tracks. Additionally, they provide folding doors and a
selection of interior fitments which allow you to customise your
storage.
A basic interior starting kit, with hanging rails for a two-door
wardrobe is priced at #28.99, while two sliding miror doors, 47in wide
in total and over 90in high are priced at #99.99 with track.
If you are lucky enough to find a chrome tubing hanging rail -- of the
type used by garment manufacturers -- that could also provide an
economic solution. Alternatively, you can get a wooden rail, in mahogany
or waxed pine, by post.
Country Furniture in Nantwich sells 100 of these rails a week,
especially to new home-owners wanting an economic solution to clothes
storage. Priced at #33 plus #4 postage and packing, the rails are 50
inches wide and 60 inches high and hold up to 20 suits or dresses and
eight pairs of shoes on the angled rack at the bottom.
A bit more expenditure -- #149 -- will let you store your clothes like
the Bedouins! Habitat offers the Bedouin wardrobe consisting of a wooden
frame and two slatted shelves, covered with canvas and secured with a
simple string tie. Measuring 120cm wide and 165cm tall, it can be teamed
with Habitat's hanging canvas storage -- ie, the striped cotton shoe
hanger for #18, or a sweater hanger for #19.50.
The newest-look wardrobe to come from the Swedish designers of IKEA
(Metro Shopping Centre, Newcastle) is the 'BRA' priced at #92. Made of
unfinished fibreboard, it has metal mesh door panels and one shelf. Its
greatest attraction, however, is its mobility -- it comes on wheels!
Anyone who has tried shifting a heavy wardrobe along a wood or even
carpeted floor will appreciate the novelty.
If you want a much more luxurious solution to clothes storage,
consider the flexible units sold by the Dutch firm Lundia, whose British
base is York. Made of solid pine and available by post, the system can
be tailor-made to individual requirements by selecting from the many
different components on offer: shelves, drawer units, upright supports,
panels, cupboards, panels, doors . . .
The firm will help you put together a design from over 60 different
basic units in seven heights, three widths and three depths, but its
illustrated catalogue offers plenty of information if you wish to
undertake the design yourself. Systems can be purchased with either a
clear lacquer or unlacquered finish but, if you prefer white, terracotta
brown or silk black, these are available to special order.
Lundia can provide you with a walk-in wardrobe or cupboard with a
storage arrangement that suits your particular needs -- enough shelves,
drawers and hanging spaces to satisfy the most discerning clothesaholic.

* VERY useful for the spare room and the occasional guest is the
Hideaway, from Marks &amp; Spencer, which can convert from compact single
bed to twins when required. Conversion is easy, as the lower bed's legs
automatically release when it is pulled out, bringing it it up to the
same height as the top bed.
The ever-so-handy Hideaway comes in Golden, Washed and Antique
finishes, and prices start at #575.
The bed settee offers another way of creating extra accommodation
without taking up extra room. Although it may carry memories of
sleepless nights on a lumpy mattress, design has moved on: bed settees
are now stylish and give a good night's sleep.
The Ligne Roset Multy can be a bed, settee or chaise longue. To
increase compactness, the cover of the settee is also the quilt for the
bed. The Multy has a beech plywood slatted base, double-density foam
mattress with removable covers for washing, ensuring a comfortable
snooze. Prices for the Multy start at #834, rising according to how many
optional extras -- such as arms and table -- are chosen.
The only way to tackle a serious space shortage is to consider the
overall design of a room. Unfortunately, the free standing wardrobes of
granny's day are no longer sufficient to hold our accumulation of work
and leisure clothes, so something more planned is required.
A fitted wardrobe has the advantage of taking into account the shape
of a room and providing pieces to fit. Sharps specialise in constructing
bedrooms which make the most of the available space by working all the
features of a room into the design. The result is a fitted bedroom which
complements the individual shape of your room. Clever ideas such as
swivelling television stands built in linen baskets and hidden drawers
and shelves further maximise living space.
Design consultation is free and involves on the spot measuring and
discussion of your needs. There is no obligation to buy and the
resulting quotation covers all costs. There are over eighty basic styles
to choose from, plus a selection of accessories to give an individual
touch such as mirrors, headboards and seats. Fitting is done by Sharps
joiners, ensuring the whole thing will fit together as promised.
IKEA is full of good ideas for saving space with three adaptable
ranges:
Antonius uses white lacquered tubular steel frames and fittings; Endel
has supports of white or galvanised metal and particleboard or pine
worktops and shelves; Sten is a basic, homely range of solid spruce
shelving. Each is made up of several component parts -- for example
Antonius shoe shelf (#3) and clothes rail (from #3); Endel's tool board
(#11); and Sten's bottle rack (#5.60).
Each range can produce a tailor-made solution to storage problems and
is suitable for bedroom, garage or study.

Road, Edinburgh. James Houston International, 426-430 Sauchiehall
Street, Glasgow. IKEA, Metro Park West, Gateshead, Tyne &amp; Wear NE11 9XS.

* LATER this month there will be a rare opportunity for collectors of
period and reproduction furniture when Phillips Scotland hosts its
premier furniture sale at its George Street salerooms in Edinburgh.
The treasures of the workshops of Whytock &amp; Reid will be strongly
represented, as you would expect of a company which has been producing
fine furniture since early last century.
During the inter-war years, they drew the following commendation from
a London agent: ''All the world brings its tribute to the warehouse of
Whytock and Reid, a tribute of exotic timbers and silky veneers . . . a
wealth of beautiful woods from which to make furniture that will be a
delight to the present and an heirloom to subsequent generations.''
Examples of the company's work to be included in the Phillips sale on
September 29 include a magnificent mahogany, burr walnut and zebra-wood
inlaid dining table, part of a suite which also has eight chairs, a
sideboard buffet, and a cutlery chest. The circular table has the
beautifully shaped and carved feet which are the hallmark of much of
Whytock &amp; Reid's work. Made during the 1930s, the whole suite is
estimated at #5000 to #8000.
From the same period is an extremely elegant walnut dressing table,
with legs ending in cloven hoof pad feet. Estimated price #1000 to
#1500. Also in walnut is a desk with inset leather writing surface,
priced at #500 to #800.
Most of the Whytock &amp; Reid pieces in the sale have these distinctive
and prominent rounded feet, a style originating in the Georgian period.
Chinese and French influences are also to be seen in many of the
entries, the firm being renowned for using a wide varity of sources for
inspiration.
In recognition of the importance of the company's contribution to the
world of cabinetmaking, Dr David Howarth, lecturer in Fine Art at
Edinburgh University, is to present an illustrated lecture on the
subject in advance of the sale.
Dr Howarth explains what makes the company so special: ''Whytock &amp;
Reid has a great tradition of craftmanship. They started in Charlotte
Square in the early 19th century and it has always given its work a
tremendous finish. The standards have always been high -- in fact you
can't get better quality.
''Although you won't find any post-modernist designs,the craftsmen
combine a tremendous variety of woods to create wonderful colour
contrasts such as zebrano which is striped African wood. They'll use
rare woods rather than the traditional standards to produce period
pieces. One-off pieces of specialised cabinetmaking, made to order to
perform specific functions, have also been produced -- for example, to
house collections of butterflies.
''Whytock &amp; Reid is an interior decorator rather than just a
cabinetmaker. It has made carpets and dealt in metalwork, items such as
unusual drop handles and fire grates. The heraldic crests of the Knights
of the Thistle are carved by Whytock &amp; Reid craftsmen. They have also
worked closely with Scottish architects over the years, such as Robert
Lorimer in the early twentieth century. In fact, they probably had their
heyday at the turn of the century when they would work with other
companies to form creative partnerships producing a total interior.
''Although the work has always followed basic design tradition, the
detailing is often very idiosyncratic and personal, like the finish on a
Georgian spoon. It's an artistic trademark. The end of the arms, for
example, on every piece may be different, or feet may be carved like
goat's.
''There is a growing interest in collecting this furniture. My own
interest stems from the strength of the craftsmanship and the unbroken
traditions. It's easy to overlook twentieth-century furniture. People
decide that if they want a Georgian-style piece it must be original --
but that seems silly.''

* A FLUTTER of wings, a flash of colour, and a beautiful visitor
arrives to add interest to your garden and perhaps even give you a song.
The cost of this home entertainment can be as little as a few kitchen
scraps and a table on which to serve them.
A bonus for your garden is that many of your bird callers will also
dine out on pests such as caterpillars, aphids and snails. Blackbirds,
blue tits and great tits, magpies, robins, starlings and song thrushes
are all pest-eaters.
Other feathered friends you can encourage to visit your garden include
the collared dove, the chaffinch, the occasional bullfinch and wren, and
the more rare grey wagtail. The bossy blackcap is most often seen in
winter.
If possible, your bird table should be placed where the birds will not
be disturbed regularly by human traffic, and the back garden is
preferable to the front.
Place the table where you can watch the birds feeding from the comfort
of a chair by a window, and where possible in a sheltered position where
it gets neither too much sun nor too much cold wind.
The table can be mounted on a post, suspended from a branch or
bracket, or even hung from a washing line. Some species such as
blackbirds, other thrushes and chaffinches prefer to feed on the ground,
so you should consider also providing a low-level feeding tray about
10cm off the ground.
The birds will prefer an open space with a good all-round view to see
that they are safe from predators while they feed. Keep the table away
from cat ambush sites -- fences and trees from which cats can leap, and
dense bushes in which they can hide -- but a small bush about a couple
of metres from the table gives the birds somewhere to perch while they
look to see whether it is safe to feed, and somewhere to dash to if
disturbed.
Bramble clippings placed around the bush will deter lurking cats.
Bird tables are readily available from garden centres, pet shops, the
RSPB, and by mail order. Making your own is well within the capability
of most people. It does not need to be complicated or fancy: the birds
are interested only in a good supply of food in a safe place.
Here are some points to bear in mind when choosing or making a bird
table:
It needs to be a reasonable size or the birds will squabble and the
shyer species will stay away. About 30cm by 50cm will do.
Avoid tables that incorporate a nestbox. Encouraging birds to feed in
another's nesting territory is not wise. However, you might wish to
consider a roof to give some protection to feeding birds from rain, snow
and the hunting sparrowhawk, which in winter is sometimes seen creating
panic among the smaller birds even in city gardens.
With minimum maintenance a good bird table should last more than 10
years. Avoid the pretty rustic ones made from silver birch logs as they
rapidly rot.
A rim about 1cm high on the table top will help to stop the food being
blown off, and gaps at the corner will allow rain to drain away.
Once your bird table is in position, a few nails or hooks around the
edges will be useful for hanging nut bags, or wire baskets for kitchen
scraps.
Don't be discouraged if it takes a few days before you attract any
birds. Once they discover the food and convince themselves it is not a
trap, they will visit your table regularly.
Proprietary seed mixtures for wild birds are available from pet shops
and are advertised in Birds, the RSPB's magazine. Look out for the Bird
Food Standards Association seal of approval for fresh, aflatoxin-free
food when buying nuts and seeds.
Many kitchen scraps are favoured by birds. Fat, including suet, is
particularly welcomed by tits, woodpeckers, thrushes and wrens. Dried
fruits are enjoyed by blackbirds, song thrushes and robins and bruised
or wizened apples are very popular with all thrushes.
If you particularly want to attract robins, try grated cheese or the
chopped rind of not-too-salty bacon.
Your bird table will obviously be most appreciated in winter, but
birds like a source of water for drinking and bathing all year round.
You can buy bird baths at most garden centres, but make sure the
inside is rough and not slippery. A simple, shallow bird bath can be
made by sinking a zinc or rubber dustbin lid in the ground.
Place a few stones in the bath to provide perches, and change the
water frequently to prevent fouling.

* THE names Michie and Braidbar have been synonymous with gardening,
horticulture and landscaping for longer than many of us can remember,
writes IAN WALLS. The man who started it all, 81-year-old George Michie,
is still very much at the helm of things. He reports to the office at
6.45am every day -- a rare animal these days, having served his
gardening apprenticeship in private service.
He started in Stonehaven and was on various estates in England before
coming back to Glasgow's Rouken Glen. Deciding to go out on his own, he
went to Braidbar in Giffnock in 1939, to find that running a nursery in
the Glasgow area could be a very seasonal affair. He decided to move
into landscaping in a big way, including movement of bulky materials
such as soil and other necessary materials.
Over the years, he must have landscaped countless gardens, road verges
and open spaces, and supplied millions of plants to clothe them.
Some 15 years ago, the site at Braidbar became very restrictive, so he
decided to develop at Hazeldene, near Newton Mearns. Because the site
was very hilly, he did something unique -- took off the top of the hill
to create a flat site.
He used the removed material in various landscape contracts across the
country for some years.
At Hazeldene, the landscape business is managed by his son David,
while George looks after the transport side of things, with 10 lorries
and a range of earth-moving equipment.
Like a lot of private service-trained gardeners, he has a lot of
sympathy for plant growth.  He is an expert plantsman, selecting and
buying in plants from many parts of the world.
I often ask him when he is going to pack it in and take life a
bit easier. But he tells me that's not for him. He has his roots in the
gardening and horticultural business. He intends to remain that way.
Other gardeners can afford to let things run down a little, however,
now that autumn beckons.

* THE WEEK'S WORK: LAWNS have made a good recovery from drought with
the recent rain. Some autumn feeding would not go amiss. Use a combined
mosskiller-fertiliser only if the grass is showing plenty of vigour.
How long summer bedding displays can hang on depends on the weather,
and how attentive you are in terms of watering.
Catalogues for bulbs have started arriving. You don't need to rush
with spring bulbs. If you want Christmas bloom from hyacinths, however,
you should get these planted in the next few weeks. Pot them up and put
them away into some dark, cool corner.
Universal pansies are now the in-thing for winter and spring displays.
You can plant them almost any time, provided you get nice hardy
specimens.
You don't need to confine spring bedding to borders. You can get busy
planting up containers, too. There is a lot to be said for the
mixed-bedding technique. This makes use of conifers interspaced with
summer and spring bedding, to give colour and interest.
The same philosophy can apply to containers, with dwarf conifers ready
to be lifted back into the garden when it comes to summer bedding time
again.
The other main task is to tidy up the vegetable and fruit gardens, and
deal with unruly hedges. Privet will certainly need cut again before
winter.
* AS gardeners soon discover, nothing changes. One of these days,
someone will find a new thing to grow container pot plants in, rather
than the peat, woodbark, coir and all the various growing media around
just now.
Actually, this ''new'' thing is already here, of course, and it's
called soil. There are billions of tons of the stuff lying around, all
over the place. Just be selective in what you use.
I tend to go for nice leafy soil in the shrub area. Sometimes I go to
nearby wasteland or woodland, to find that stuff with a lovely, spongy
feel to it. Anyway, you will have to put your collected soil through a
riddle, once it is dried. Possibly add in some sand; and a bit of lime
and fertiliser will not go amiss.
The result will amaze you in the way plants respond. All it need cost
is the time and trouble of finding the soil in the first place, and
putting it through the riddle. You can even put it back where it came
from after use.
After all, excellent pot plants were grown long before all the fancy
new composts came on the scene. I sometimes wonder if we haven't been
brainwashed into thinking there is something magical about these patent
composts.
It's certainly true that leaf mould -- one of the finest natural
composts you can find -- is not always readily to hand. It might take
just a little effort to bring it in. But you seldom get any weeds in it.
Particularly when you take it from a fairly mature wood area.
Why not try a little experiment for yourself, just to see what happens
. . . This autumn, put some of your plants into a mix of this leaf-mould
kind of soil. And put some into any soil-less compost you choose. Decide
for yourself which lot comes away better.

NOW is the time to ensure a spectacular start to the spring season by
planting flowering bulbs such as narcissus (pictured here).
* YOU can layer bulbs in pots and plant them close together. Put
broken crocks in the bottom of your container to stop bulbs being
waterlogged. Add a few inches of soil.
* PLANT larger bulbs on this layer. Add more soil, then the smaller
flowering bulbs. The cross-section drawing shows how it should look
inside.

* HOME is the place where we all feel at our safest -- as safe as
houses -- in the heart of the family. But, in terms of fire, just how
safe and well-protected is your home? And, were the unthinkable to
happen, and a blaze occur, would everyone know what to do? Most
importantly, would they have any clue about how to escape -- or at least
protect themselves until the fire brigade's arrival -- if they were
trapped?
The answer for the majority of us, alas, will be NO, on all counts.
Strathclyde Fire Brigade -- Britain's third largest after London and
West Midlands -- protects 2.3 million people within an area which
stretches from the Ayrshire coast across Glasgow, up to Oban and out to
the islands. The brigade, with 3101 uniformed personnel headed by
Firemaster John Jameson, has seen a very encouraging downward trend in
its fire fatality figures in recent years, with 1994 showing the lowest
level of deaths (47) since its formation in 1975.
It may still be a horrifying toll of human tragedy, but, compared with
1985, when the figure was 89, the steadily increasing statistics -- 17
fire fatalities up to the end of July this year, compared with 25 for
the same period last year -- tell their own story of success.
Divisional Officer Keith Small explains: ''Since 1990, we have seen a
real decline in fire fatalities which we attribute to the fact that we
have been doing for more community education over the last few years. We
have community firefighters who go out to talk to schools and groups who
ask us -- WRVS and Neighbourhood Watch, for example. We do believe the
reduction in fatalities is in part due to this work.''
The installation of smoke alarms or detectors has grown enormously in
recent years, buying peace of mind for the outlay of only a few pounds.
However, Keith Small cautions: ''Installing a smoke alarm is not the end
of the matter. If it's battery-operated, it must be tested every month,
just by pressing the button, and the battery must be replaced annually.
''People forget the smoke detector. It becomes part of the furniture.
It's desperately sad, but when we find after a fatal fire that a smoke
alarm was installed, it had either had no battery or the battery was
flat. The price of small battery could have saved somebody's life. We
encourage people to give their smoke detectors a birthday -- one of the
family's birthday, Christmas Day, whatever -- and give it a present of a
battery that day each year.
''We also emphasise that a smoke detector won't stop a fire happening,
but it will detect one. The best precautions are to stop a fire
happening in the first place. That's where check-lists and
self-assessment of your home (available from fire stations around
Strathclyde) is important.''
Smoke detectors are now required to be fitted in new houses by law,
and although these are hard-wired, there will still be battery-operated
back-up. The same regular checks should be made monthly, and the battery
replaced annually.
Strathclyde Fire Brigade has linked up with the National Association
of Estate Agents, to encourage home-buyers and sellers to put a smoke
detector on their shopping list when they're moving. ''What we're
encouraging estate agents to do, as part of the house schedule, is to
put in a message about smoke detectors. We hope that when people are
putting their houses are up for sale, they'll mention that it has a
detector fitted as another selling point,'' says Divisional Officer
Small, adding that the Strathclyde initiative will become a UK-wide one.
The Strathclyde Brigade's 999 Appeal Trust raises money to buy -- and
sometimes install -- smoke detectors to give to those known to be at
particular risk from fire, who may not be able to afford one of their
own.
Particularly vulnerable groups include the elderly who may well have
forgotten their safety precautions; the very young who don't understand
the dangers; and those who take alcohol to excess, which dulls their
senses.
''They are at home, in what they think is a safe environment, but are
not aware of what is going on,'' explains Keith Small. ''With dulled
reactions, they can't act in the right way if a fire breaks out. These
are the groups we target, to try to get the message over.''
Of the 47 fire deaths in Strathclyde last year, 14 were in the over-70
age group, and six aged 60-69. ''Alcohol was a contributory factor in a
lot of the cases, as well as drugs and medication. The latter
particularly affects the elderly, who may be on sedatives at night and
as a result have reduced awareness.''
''Dropped light'' -- which frequently means carelessly discarded
smoking materials, such as a match or cigarette being dropped into
furnishings -- was established as having caused the fire in 22 of the
fatalities during 1994.
''Smoking in bed is a problem, especially if it is an elderly or
infirm person who's confined to bed. Their carers may not want to
deprive them of all their pleasures, so they allow them to smoke in bed.
The best advice is not to, but if they must, the carer should make sure
they have a safe and stable ashtray, and they might consider installing
an additional smoke detector in the bedroom.''
Chip-pan fires continue on their not-very-merry way as major causes of
fires at home, although not necessarily high on the list where deaths
are concerned. ''This can be the fatal combination: people coming in
after a few drinks on a Friday or Saturday evening, feeling hungry,
deciding to put the chip pan on and forgetting it. They fall asleep in
the living room, the chip fan bursts into flames and starts to spread,
and if they don't have a fire detector which would pick it up early,
they're totally unaware of what's happening.
''Perhaps the wife and children are asleep in other rooms, also
unaware of what's happening. That scenario I'm afraid, happens all too
often.''
Electricity is the cause of many fires: checking plugs and sockets to
make sure they are properly wired, and properly fused, is important.
Open fires should be protected with guards if young children or elderly
people are around your home. Where young children are concerned, their
fascination with fire can be fatal: make sure they don't have access to
lighters and matches. Nor should they be left alone with open gas or
electric fires whose glow can be fatally attractive.
Should someone's clothes catch fire, teach everyone the rules: Stop,
drop, roll. In other words, don't run, stop; drop to the floor and roll
over and over, to extinguish the flames.
Finally, when a fire breaks out, don't assume someone else has called
the fire service. ''We'd rather have half a dozen calls about the same
fire than none,'' assures Keith Small.
Ask at your local fire station for leaflets on protecting your home
and family against fire.

JOAN EARDLEY was the most prestigious woman artist to work in post-war
Scotland and as such is the only woman in the Scottish Masters Series.
The strength of her compositions has recently been acknowledged south of
the Border with a purchase made by the Tate Gallery.
Eardley's work has an expressive realism that pre-dates the
Kitchen-sink School. The scrumbling of her paint surfaces in the
street-kid paintings and the use of graffiti in backgrounds brings her
imagery close to that of the continental Art Brut artists. The wild
exuberance of her chalk studies and final oils of stormy weather on the
east coast of Scotland reach a near abstraction.
Alan Bowness has criticised her tenuous hold on realism, citing Lanyon
as the better artist. As Lanyon is to St Ives, so Eardley is to
Scotland. She is held by many to be the most faithful exponent of the
genius of the place. The two places closest to Eardley's heart were
Glasgow and the north-east coastal fishing village of Catterline.
Eardley's family moved to Glasgow from London as war broke out. The
young Eardley studied at Glasgow School of Art from 1940-43 and after
war service and a period at Hospitalfield, Arbroath, again in 1948-9.
Her final studies included a travelling scholarship to France and Italy.
Upon her return an exhibition was held at the School of Art. Eardley
exhibited studies of peasants and beggars, people on the street, by the
river, or in churches.
This interest in the everyday continued in Glasgow. She took a studio
in Cochrane Street and began to make studies of the local children,
drawing them in her studio, on the street or from personal snapshots.
In 1952 Eardley met the photographer Audrey Walker whose subjects
included graffiti on tenement facades. At about this time Eardley moved
to St James Road, Townhead. The long rows of shuttered half-derelict
shops and graffiti-ridden doors and walls were incorporated into her
compositions. Eardley's art was contemporary with the use of child art
and graffiti by Dubuffet, Jorn, and Wols but retained a stronger sense
of the subject matter. Eardley continued to depict the Glasgow children
throughout her career. The later works incorporated collage elements and
lettering to suggest the litter-strewn streets and faded facades of old
shop fronts.
The fishing village of Catterline, just south of Stonehaven, became
Eardley's home in 1956 until her death in 1963. Eardley took to painting
out of doors in all weathers. She stood on the seashore with her sheet
of hardboard held down by boulders and strove to complete her work in
one session. The village was set up on cliffs overlooking the tiny
harbour. The rocky outcrops that stood along the shoreline, the
whitewashed houses clinging to the cliff top and the fields beyond, all
featured in her studies of the locality.
Eardley's sketches and oils of the weather and the seasons at
Catterline are monumental in their strength of image and expressive
energy. The sheer power of Eardley's visiton is unique in post-war
Scottish art.

WATCHING a venerable piece of crockery plunge to our quarry-tiled
floor and disintegrate beyond all reasonable yoohooing, set me
meditating this week on mugs.
There must, I'm sure have been mugs around (drinking utensils not
bamsticks) during my childhood in the middle years of this century but
homes were certainly not equipped with them in all the bizarre shapes
and sizes and with the cheeky logos found in today's kitchens.
Rough tea cups and saucers were more often the order of the day and
only when paying an ''offishell'' visit to relatives was the best cheeny
produced from the glass cabinet in the hall.
I have a special recollection of a purply-gold willow pattern set -- I
think it must have been at my Aunty Jeanie's in Whitecrook -- a wee
coolie in a wide brimmed hat humphing a long pole bent under the weight
of the baskets attached to each end -- across an impossibly steep
humped-back bridge. Below in the tree-fringed stream, a grotesque fish
with huge Jagger lips, popped its head above the surface and eyed the
burdened peasant. Odd how this memory persists but the fact is that such
tea sets were extra special, for important occasions only.
Of course, we all liked to put on a bit of a show when we have guests
-- not an ostentatious display, you understand -- simply an indication
that we're not quite ready for the poors house just yet. Personally I
like to produce gems from my record collections. A precious long-playing
record of a steam train trip from Glasgow to Fort William or the
infamous EP of tape recorded Voices from the Dead both fair
get-the-party-going.
Anyway, when the Earl of Moray, predecessor of the ''Good Region'' was
nominated to play host to Contareno, Patriarch of Venice in March, 1543,
it promised to be a pretty heavy event. The Venetian had come to
dissuade the Scots from giving the young Queen Mary in marriage to
Edward VI of England.
Moray by all accounts was up to high-dough over the political
significance of a dinner party he was to host for the visiting dignitary
and decided to push the boat out. Although he had plenty of silverplate
, ''for greater magnificence'' he brought out a splendid set of crystal
dishes and glasses.
Anxious to convince the Patriarch that scotland was way up there in
the European league of affluence and not, as was more generally held, a
bit of cultural and social backwater, Moray arranged for one of his
servants ''as it had been by sloth and negligence'' to whip away the
cupboard cloth and send the whole lot crashing to the floor.
Without a blink, the Earl summoned another cupboard brimful of even
finer crystal as if it had all been a matter of little consequence. A
pretty expensive public relations exercise you may say but we learn that
the Patriarch was mighty impressed by this phoney show of opulence.
Deliberate smashing of crockery in the noble style is only permitted
here at School Place when news filters through on the pigeon post that
Clydebank FC have recorded a victory. I can report that last season
breakages were few, painfully few.

IN among the familiar rosy-cheeked timeworn and weatherbeaten faces at
the famous Papay dances in the summer just past were a flock of
''birdie'' folk. When they weren't whirling around the Holland loft like
winged dervishes and being persuaded to ''tak a peedie grain mair'' home
brew they could be found in a huddle earnestly debating the predatory
habits of Larus Marinus, the Greater Black-backed Gull, or in the Papa
Westray shorthand -- the ''backie''.
This cosmopolitan bunch led by the far-travelled, short-sighted Paul,
also included this year Tina from Finland, Fiona from Inverness, Chris a
genuine London-Scot and oor Lindsey. Over the past couple of summers the
team from Glasgow University have become as much a fixture of the Papay
scene as the Arctic terms or Tommy o' Maybo's shiny broon check bunnet.
When the ornithology section's distinctive Land Rover swings ashore
from the steamer we know that the birdie folk are back and the short
summer can commence here in earnest. Their mobile HQ is notable
principally because of the amazing tracking aerial built into the roof
which went despatched heavenwards is an impressive even surreal sight,
in the flatlands of Orkney.
The squad spent the summer shuttling back and forward across the azure
water of the South Wick between the Old Pier and the Holm -- our very
own desert island -- where they've been running the rule over the colony
of some 80 or so pairs of black Guillemots. (teisties in the Papay
patois). What they haven't learned about the nesting, breeding and
feeding habits of these cute wee birds with coal black bodies, pointy
beaks and scarlet pins, is hardly worth knowing.
Here at School Place we had several reasons to welcome their summer
stop-over. First of all, they rented the rather forlorn auld manse just
up the brae and for the duration the windows were flung wide, washing
flapped comfortingly on the line and there was a steady stream of
comings and goings. Nice to have neighbours up there, even for a few
weeks.
Secondly the hungry hide dwellers helped boost the income of the
island's only shop. Research projects are always strapped for cash but
this crew survived majestically on a diet of pot noodles. On one
occasion I saw Tom, Paul's towering right-hand man, who said he was from
fairly near Largs which is surely Ardrossan, pushing a trolley creeking
under a veritable mountain of noodles. I am sadly out of touch with both
city and university life, but I reckon this must be some kind of cult
thing.
Now there's a lot of this bird monitoring business that's way above my
head. You need to know, however, that the teistie chicks have a nasty
and decidedly anti-social habit of squirting shit at you when you pick
them up; many of the chicks which you've watched growing end up being
gobbled for elevenses by those aforementioned backies; as well as
numbering nests and birds the little darlings get named -- Linford and
Smelly -- being among this summer's star turns; sitting silently and
motionless in a hide for four-hours also puts tremendous pressure on the
bladder.
And so, the weeks went by, a sequence of hide watches, nest checks and
chick counts, blessed with some of the most splendidly warm and sunny
weather seen on the island in living memory. Away from the ornithology
and the occasional barn dance the team helping out with the baling and
the fitter members even managed a game of football down at our Clover
Bowl, the school playing field. And then like the terns, they were gone,
until next year.
In my last despatch I promised a corncrake update. Most recent info I
can lay hands on suggests that 40 corncrake calling sites were
identified in Orkney this summer compared with 18 last year (only one on
Papay I'm afraid). Substantial improvement, but still a lot of work to
do to save the species as the experts' assessment.
To those among you who have found this bird life thing a tad
monotonous, then I promise this will be the last column on the topic for
a wee while.

Sea-salt amphitheatres, teeming with life, are an endless source of
fascination for Bruce Sandison
OUTDOORS means different things to different people. For some, it is
but an extension of urban life, a place in which to develop personal
skills and physical ambition: Munro-bagging, rock climbing, mountain
biking, orienteering, hill walking. For others, it means fishing,
bird-watching, botany, archaeology, bucket-and-spade holidays, watching
the world go by in different, more pleasant surroundings.
The twain should meet. All that is best in life may be found amid
Scotland's lonely hills and glens, on its loch-clad moorlands and rocky
shores; and, I believe, an understanding of our natural heritage is as
important to mental well-being as scaling the heights is of benefit to
our city-jaded bodies. Together, the twain give birth to a great
adventure, a life-long, enduring, environmental voyage of discovery.
I discovered this ''truth'' many years ago, in Orkney, during a family
holiday. My parents had rented a cottage on the shores of Scapa Flow.
The owners, the Isbisters of Backakeldy, were just the sort of people to
enthuse a boy in things outdoor; three brothers and three sisters,
working a good farm; homely, kind people, who always had time to stop
and answer the hundreds of questions which small boys invariably ask.
I roamed from Tongue of Gangsta north, south to Taing of Westbank;
along dark, jagged cliffs crowded with stiff-winged fulmar, kittiwake
and tern; saw oil patches rise from the wreck of HMS Royal Oak, sunk
during the early days of the Second World War; midnight marvelled at the
''Merry Dancers'', the Northern Lights; sang to sad-faced seals as they
bobbed in the bay.
But my most fascinating discovery was the rock pools on the shores:
sea-salt amphitheatres, teeming with life. I would sit for ages, gazing
into their mysterious depths, sometimes watching awesome battles between
the creatures below. Endless pursuits, life-and-death struggles. The
colours on the rocks, seaweed, shells, and sand fascinated me. And the
thought of the transient nature of their existence, tide by tide.
For adult and child alike, rock-pool exploration is a constant joy;
easily integrated into an invigorating walk and the perfect combination
for little and not so little legs. One of the best places to begin is on
the rocky shore below the imposing bulk of Culzean Castle in Ayrshire,
owned by the National Trust for Scotland. The trust has laid out a
series of walks around the castle grounds, including the Culzean
foreshore.
Along the shore you will find hermit crab, spider crab, shore crab,
starfish, Brittle star, sea anemone, sea slug, sea urchin, cowrie and
venus shells, cockles, whelks, limpet, mussels, barnacle, ghost prawn,
rock goby, sea hare, butterfish, sponge, many more. There is a wide
variety of seaweeds; channel wrack, bladder wrack, oarweed, serrated
wrack, knotted wrack, sea lettuce: and above the tide, below the lava
cliffs, wonderful lichens, coloured grey, yellow, and black.
Park rangers are on hand to explain it all, and the bird and plant
life associated with the foreshore habitat.The shore is dominated by the
Dolphin House, a laundry from 1780 to 1900. Adjacent to the Dolphin
House is the Bath House, and, in front, the Round House, erected in 1800
as a changing-room for hardy bathers.
Those with less organised inclinations can do their own thing anywhere
round the coast of Scotland.And there is always the chance of spotting
larger animals along the way. On a visit to Shetland I watched two
otters hunting crustaceans among waving fronds of seaweed. By the beach
at Achiltibuie, in Wester Ross, a whale suddenly surfaced and spouted.
Dolphins in the Moray Firth, as I explored Hugh Miller's fossil beds
near Rosemarkie. The amazing sight of a sea-eagle as I wandered over a
Barra strand.
All these creatures live in well-ordered harmony within their
environment, each in its place, each with a role to play on God's ''braw
birlin earth''. The more we know about them, the more we will know about
ourselves, and the responsibility we have to ensure that our fellow
creatures survive. This is the message the rock pools bring. The message
of the lonely corries and distant lochs, of wind and rain and sunlight
on the hill. The true message of the Great Outdoors.

SCOTLAND'S four representatives on the Britain and Ireland Walker Cup
side -- Gordon Sherry and Stephen Gallacher, Graham Rankin and Barclay
Howard -- have had a clear responsibility laid on their shoulders
towards a positive start being made today at Royal Porthcawl in the
first series of 12 games against the United States.
The previous success of both these pairs has easily persuaded their
captain, Clive Brown, to bring them together again in the foursomes, in
which he has also called upon the proven Irish combination of Padraig
Harrington and Jody Fanagan. The English partnership of Mark Foster and
David Howell stands alone in its novelty.
True to their words, Brown and his opposite number, Downing Gray, have
given all 10 of their players an outing. A confrontation between Sherry
and Tiger Woods, their countries' respective champions, will not,
however, take place, for whereas Sherry will lead off the singles Woods
will play in the last of these eight games.
Brown explained: ''I wanted Gordon to lead because he has the
experience and confidence from which the others can take inspiration,
and in terms of his contribution to the team's preparations during this
week, his attitude and approach have been in every way first class.''
Doubts persist over Woods' fitness. The severe intestinal disorder
which caused him to miss practice on Thursday confined him to three
holes yesterday. Woods, suffering from stomach cramps, then returned to
his hotel, but if he is unfit this morning Gray is entitled to make a
straight substitution.
Sherry's singles opponent is still of unusual interest. Notah Begay is
not only the first native American to appear in the match, he putts
right-handed when the borrow is right to left and left-handed when the
slope runs the other way, a system he has employed for five years ''to
give me more control over the speed of the putt.''
Before he competes Begay, in accordance with his people's tradition,
applies fine red clay to his face as he recites a prayer taught him by
his mother. There are no reports that Sherry, like some golfing
Braveheart, intends to respond with a similar coating of woad.
Woods is now to face Gary Wolstenholme, whose father Guy played in the
1957 and 1959 matches, and, on paper at least, Rankin faces the next
most daunting opponent. John Harris, whose maximum of three points
contributed so effectively to the 1993 rout by 14 points, won the US
title the next week.
But, in truth, no contest is easy before the players come under the
starter's call, and as with the Ryder Cup match, the determining factor
invariably concerns less an examination of technique than of attitude
and commitment and reaction to events, favourable or otherwise.
Certainly, the absolute imperative of not allowing the match
immediately to slip away from his players would need no emphasis by
Brown. In the last two matches here, at Sunningdale in 1987 and at
Portmarnock four years later, all four foursomes on the first morning
were lost and along with them all hope of victory.
Whatever Woods' disposition, his sort of phenomenal length will not be
a priority. To negotiate the 6685-yard links in the variable weather
predicted for today and tomorrow will, instead, as Harris noted, require
''patience, perseverance, and a sharp game around the greens.''
As to the outcome this combined side, if it plays to its capabilities,
can banish the memory of the 19-5 debacle at Interlachen. The lop-sided
American supremacy of 30 wins and a tie in 34 matches speaks for itself.
But only two years after the 16[1/2]-7[1/2] drubbing in 1987 Britain and
Ireland won for the first time in America.

* IF YOU didn't already know that Aileen Paterson is the talent behind
the Maisie books -- the author/illustrator is currently working on the
feisty feline's 18th adventure -- then a visit to her Edinburgh home
would leave you in no doubt, writes AILEEN LITTLE.
The sitting room of Paterson's 120-year-old former artisan's cottage
is just like her drawings: fun-packed, cluttered and amazingly
colourful. Maisie in purrson oversees the bric-a-brac in the shape of a
commercially produced soft toy, one of which was gifted by the Scottish
Office to the Duke and Duchess of York to mark the birth of their first
daughter.
Maisie herself was ''born'' in 1982 and is, according to her creator,
a reincarnation of Paterson as a child (''a wee blether and a mischief
maker'').
On the sofa, knitted versions of Maisie and her Gran carry
particularly fond associations. ''A retired teacher in Leven made me
those. She studied the drawings and made her own pattern,'' says
Paterson appreciatively.
The artist seems to inspire affection. People derive as much pleasure
from giving her (usually cat-orientated) things as she gets from
displaying them. ''I am starting to dread Christmas and birthdays
though, since I just don't have the space any more.''
There is the Chinese cat teapot given by Paterson's eldest daughter,
one of five children. Her son brought back a striking Egyptian cat from
the Metropolitan Museum in New York. And a friend presented the ivory
cat goddess on the mantelpiece -- a good luck talisman.
But Aileen Paterson is not averse to treating herself when necessary.
After all, some things you have to have. ''I bought the cat clock in
America. It's a copy of a Kit Cat clock popular in the 1930s. And, since
I'm from Fife, I had to buy the reproduction Wemyss cat. If I ever win
the lottery, I'll get the real thing.''
She also collects antique children's books, Clarice Cliff pottery and
drawings by artists she admires.
Not surprisingly, Paterson's own work features in the decor. For a
boutique -- Digger, West Nicholson Street, in Edinburgh -- she produced
Maisie clocks, two of which enhance the sideboard. Paterson's business
logo is Duck Soup Designs, a tribute to the Marx Brothers whom she
adores. In deference to the comedy trio, she bought a caricature
statuette of Groucho from a London junk stall.
''There is nothing here I don't care about,'' confirms Paterson, who
is negotiating with an Irish company about an animated film of Maisie.
''A lot of my things aren't just pretty ornaments. They're things I have
rescued. I like to think now they're with me, that they feel
cherished.''

ON THE day they meet at Pittodrie, two of Jock Stein's proteges, Tommy
Burns and Roy Aitken, managers of Celtic and Aberdeen, will not allow
memories of the man who died precisely 10 years earlier to interfere
with their concentration on the 90 minutes ahead. He would certainly
have approved.
The bust of the great man presented to the club by Not The View, the
fanzine, yesterday (it was rejected by the previous board in 1989) was a
reminder perhaps to both former pupils that they have much to do if they
are to come anywhere near matching his standards. They will prefer just
to get on with their own jobs and leave legends to rest in peace.
Burns reckons both his team and Aberdeen are working along similar
lines, trying to restore past glories. ''We both feel we should be
genuine contenders for all the prizes and I am certain Aberdeen will be
a much better side this season.''
The 1.0pm kick-off tomorrow may seem a little strange for the players,
but the Celtic manager does not think it will have any effect on the
quality of the play. ''I am sure it will be a good game to see and the
live television coverage gives it an extra edge.''
The Parkhead line-up will depend largely on the fitness of John
Collins, who took a groin strain during Wednesday's European
Championship game with Finland at Hampden. ''He has progressed well
since yesterday, but we will make a decision about whether he is in or
out tomorrow.''
Andreas Thom has recovered from a knock which means that Celtic, with
the exception of Paul McStay and possibly Collins, have a full squad
from which to choose.
McStay is coming along nicely after two operations on his ankle, and
he hopes to be playing in a game of some description next week. He
believes he will be ready for serious action well before the next
international, the friendly with Sweden next month.
''First of all, I have to get back into the Celtic team, but there is
no doubt the likelihood that we will be in England next year gives all
the candidates for the national team a big incentive. Craig Brown will
be picking the players in form at the end of the season.''
He will have to suffer on the sidelines tomorrow as his team begin a
daunting period involving major games in the league, cup, and Europe.
As well as bringing together two old team mates in Burns and Aitken,
the Pittodrie meeting also brings into opposition two players who faced
each other in a vital European tie 10 years ago. Thom, then with Dynamo
Berlin, scored in the penalty shoot-out which settled their tie with
Aberdeen in the European Cup in East Germany. Stewart McKimmie remembers
it well.
''I was just a lad then and so was he,'' said McKimmie. ''He was very
sharp and scored against us over there in the return and in the penalty
shoot-out. It was a very hard game which we were unlucky to lose.
Speaking to the Celtic players with Scotland this week, I was told Thom
is still a very dangerous player. He will cause us problems if we don't
deal with him in the right way. There is no doubt about that.''
The Scotland full back is confident his team can cope well enough, and
in fact will be a vastly different side this season. He said: ''Counting
last season, we have now won eight consecutive games which is as good a
record as we've ever had. The difference is that we are being encouraged
to play positively and are full of confidence.''
Aberdeen have striker Duncan Shearer fit, but Aitken will name an
unchanged team. ''The boys up front have been doing very well for me,''
he said. ''I anticipate we will get a spin-off from all our players
performing so well for their country in midweek. This is a high-profile
game and a great platform for the players. I know they are up for it. I
can sense the mood is right and they will handle it as they have done in
the past.''

* ''I'LL hoot if I see anything,'' the man in the next car said. We
were parked on an east coast headland on a windy, bright September
morning, watering eyes peering down telescopes across the blue and white
North Sea. The light was behind us and the wind was onshore. We were
engaged in that esoteric branch of ornithology called seawatching. This
is an appropriate name as sea is what you see, most of the time. What
you are trying to see, of course, are the rarer seabirds which come
close to the coast in certain conditions. The views you get will be
distant and fleeting. Hence it was with great relief that, just as I
identified the lean brown shape skimming between the creel buoys and the
inbound tanker a mile away, my neighbour's horn sounded.
''Sooty shearwater,'' he shouted through the window, utterly
confident. As so often with birdwatching, memory replayed the ten second
glimpse I had had, and overlaid it with the extraordinary facts about
this Scottish bird. Every year small groups of these wave riding oceanic
wanderers, larger and eponymously darker than our own Manx shearwaters,
tour our coasts in late summer. They may come up the Forth to the
bridges, but large numbers are only seen off the north west islands.
Sooty shearwaters cover the world's oceans looking for squid and oily
fish. They plane downwind between wave crests but in order to move into
a gale, like all longwinged seabirds, they soar into the faster air 50
feet up, gain speed, then turn down to where the friction of the water
surface slows the wind so their weight and momentum can carry them
against it before they rise to repeat the loop. The economy of effort is
beautiful to watch. My sooty shearwater was swinging downwind, banking
to show the silvery sheen of his long, long underwing. And where does
this elegant tourist breed? The Falkland Islands and New Zealand.

There you are, after 4600 million years, still living for the weekend.
Bruce Sandison explains how to become attuned to geological time
IF AN immortal, extra-terrestrial observer blinked, he would miss it.
Homo sapiens' tenure of planet earth. In the context of geological time,
human existence represents the merest blip, the most insignificant
cosmic micro-second within a span of 4600 million years. Think about
this as you prepare to celebrate the new millennium. Here today, gone
tomorrow?
And yet, we have been fashioned by our geological past. Everything we
are is the measured result of the geological forces which formed our
planet and gave us birth; our domestic history, social divisions,
culture, lifestyle, industry, commerce -- hopes, dreams, fears.
''Pre-Cambrian'' denotes the time from the origin of the earth until
600 million years ago, when primitive life forms with hard parts that
could be easily fossilised first appeared -- 90% of the total assumed
age of the planet. Modern man, homo sapiens, didn't bloom until about
25,000 years ago.
Scotland lay in the grip of the last Great Ice Age for most of the
last two million years. Volcanic complexes, such as Ardnamurchan --
formed 60 million years ago when a vast landmass including North
America, Greenland, Europe and East Asia was breaking up -- were covered
by millions of tons of ice.
As the ice retreated, 15,000 years ago, gouging out Scotland's deep,
fiord-like sea lochs and glens, our precious landscape emerged from
slumber to receive its first inhabitants: Mesolithic hunter-gatherers,
displaced from Europe.
The landforms they saw remain largely unchanged. Evidence of our
geological heritage is all around: Edinburgh's Arthur's Seat and Castle
Rock, extinct volcanoes, active 350 million years ago; Nithsdale, where
quarries near Dumfries revealed fossil footprints in the sand: 280
million years ago the area was a desert.
The golf links at St Andrews, North Berwick, Gullane, Carnoustie, Old
Prestwick, Barassie, and Turnberry are raised beaches, formed as the
level of the land lifted and new, lower, shorelines formed. Lime Craig
Quarry in the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in the Trossachs lies on the
Highland Boundary Fault Line, where an ocean was swallowed, 500 million
years ago.
The River Forth by Stirling, meandering through the Midland Valley,
bounded by the Ochil Hills and a 1000ft high ridge formed by volcanic
lava flows 400 million years ago. The molten rock, granite slabs of the
Merrick (2780ft) and Mullwharchar (2270ft), in Galloway. The hexagonal,
basalt, columns of Fingal's Cave on Staffa, sculpted from volcanic
activity at much the same time as on Ardnamurchan.
We are creatures of this environment, constantly in awe of the fearful
forces which generate and order our existence. It is impossible not to
be impressed by the unforgiving hand of nature, and throughout our
meagre lives men have paid homage to these forces and struggled to
unravel the mysteries which they enfold.
You don't have to be an expert geologist nor do you require anything
other than curiosity to find out about how Mother Earth was formed. You
will quickly graduate to a geological hammer, but the first step is to
seek sound, professional help.
There are geological societies in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and in Glasgow.
Their membership encompasses a wide range of knowledge and newcomers
benefit from having access to first-class lectures conducted by experts;
and the fun of hands-on exploration of significant Scottish geological
sites.
Edinburgh is recognised as being the ''cradle'' of modern geology and
this is largely due to the work of James Hutton (1726-1797), farmer,
scientist, philosopher, and leading member of the Scottish
Enlightenment. In 1788, Hutton published his Theory of the Earth which
is regarded as the foundation of modern geology.
The Edinburgh Geological Society, founded in 1834, is one of the
oldest scientific societies in Scotland. They have regular winter
meetings and summer field excursions. Members receive copies of the
Scottish Journal of Geology, published jointly by the Edinburgh and
Glasgow societies; and the Edinburgh Geologist, aimed at less
specialised readers.
The Glasgow Geological Society is just as active, with summer field
trips and meetings from October to March. The Department of Adult &amp;
Continuing Education of Glasgow University promote an excellent range of
courses, including a beginners' course starting in October.
Non-members are welcome at the societies' winter meetings and this is
a good way to have a first chip at the geological experience.

COLIN Montgomerie and Sam Torrance, first and second in the European
money list, continued to fight it out at the top at the Lancome Trophy
in Paris yesterday.
Torrance, who started the day one stroke behind his fellow Scot, came
in with a 67 for an eight-under-par, 36-hole aggregate of 132 to take a
one-shot lead, while Montgomerie, who bogeyed two of his first three
holes, shot a 69 for 133.
Montgomerie's poor start allowed his 42-year-old rival to take a lead
he would never lose, but Torrance, two clear with one to play, bunkered
his tee shot at the short eighteenth and bogeyed the hole.
New Zealander Michael Campbell is third on 134 after a 68, with Iain
Pyman, the former British Amateur champion, fourth on 133 after a 66
which included only 24 putts.
Jose Maria Olazabal, still uncertain about his Ryder Cup place, limped
round for a 67 and a two-under-par total of 138, but said his foot was a
little better and he may now leave his decision about whether to
withdraw from the Cup team until Monday.
Ian Woosnam, hoping to take Olazabal's place if the Spaniard drops out
of the team, is three further back but only because of a disastrous 7 at
the fifteenth where he snap-hooked his drive into the trees.
Frenchman Jean-Louis Guepy equalled the course record of 62 and Mark
Roe, beset by domestic problems, shot a 16-over-par 86 -- but the day
still belonged to Torrance and Montgomerie.
Torrance, who had four birdies before his only bogey at the last, has
a double incentive to keep ahead of his fellow Scot. He wants to add the
Lancome Trophy to victories in the Italian and Irish Opens earlier in
the year knowing, if he carries off the first prize of #100,000, he
would go top of the order of merit even if Montgomerie finishes second.
At present, Torrance is #30,000 behind Montgomerie but would go more
than #3000 ahead of his rival if he wins the tournament.
Both Scots insist they are thinking only of this week although
Torrance probably has his fingers crossed when saying as much, for he
has been chasing the European top spot for 24 years while Montgomerie
has finished top for the last two years.
Today they are paired for the third successive day and Torrance is
happy with that. ''Monty is the man to beat, this week and every week,''
he says. ''It's nice to be able to keep an eye on him.''
Of the nine Ryder Cup team members in the field, Torrance,
Montgomerie, Olazabal, Bernhard Langer, Seve Ballesteros, Costantino
Rocca, and David Gilford all made the halfway cut with ease, Mark James
scrambled in on the last qualifying score of six-over-par 146 while
Howard Clark missed the cut by a shot.
Tom Lehman, the only American Ryder Cup team member in the field, shot
a 70 for 137 and, five off the pace, still has an outside chance of
victory.
Glasgow's Adam Hunter withdrew and returned home after feeling unwell
during a first-round 87.
* BUCHANAN Castle pro William Guy completed his rain-delayed final

Yesterday, he fired back-to-back birdies and a brace of closing pars.

It is a staggering tale of ornithological sex and enviromental racism.
And for one jaunty little bird it means a bitter fight for survival.
Willy Newlands sends this dispatch from the battle of the Ruddy Duck
SIR Peter Scott is remembered as one of Britain's pioneer
conservationists. He started out as a duck-hunter, made a fortune as a
bird painter, became a TV personality, and was one of the founders of
the World Wildlife Fund.
Unfortunately, he made one small mistake.
In 1957, he failed to notice that a few ruddy ducks which he had
imported from the US to his Wildfowl Trust in the West of England had
managed to escape. Not only did they get out, they also started
breeding.
Within a few years, there were plump little ruddy ducks everywhere,
thousands of them. They found England's large new reservoirs
particularly attractive and settled down to become part of the rural
landscape, steadily moving north and into Scotland by the 1980s.
Dr Barry Hughes, of the Wildfowl Trust, said: ''The first breeding
record in Scotland was at the Loch of Kinnordy, beside Kirriemuir, in
Angus. For several years, that was the only place they bred in Scotland,
but now they have spread widely.
''There are four breeding sites in Angus, one in Berwickshire, two in
Lanarkshire, one in the Lothians, five in Perth and Kinross, one in
Tweeddale, one in Roxburgh, eight in Fife -- about 100 pairs in total.
They winter in the south.''
The ruddy ducks also enjoy wider wanderings -- in North America they
are great travellers on the migratory flyways of the West -- and they
decided to explore Holland, then France, and fatally, Spain.
In Spain, the American explorers met a very rare relative, the
white-headed duck. This rather shy species had been down to very low
numbers in Europe -- as few as 20 may have survived in 1977, although
captive breeding has since boosted numbers up to nearly 1000. There are
20,000 whiteheads far to the East in Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, but
they are said to be declining in numbers.
Female whiteheads find the ruddy drakes irresistible lovers. While the
male whiteheads are fighting -- which they do most of the time -- the
ruddy males rush in and grab their mates. The result is the ruddy-white
hybrid, which conservationists have greeted with horror.
So an official death sentence has been passed by Europe's conservation
groups on the North American refugee, known by now as the ''flying rat''
because it multiplies so quickly. Gunners are out killing the breeding
birds on their nests and pouring paraffin on the eggs, which has
provoked an outcry from bird lovers.
The League Against Cruel Sports says it is ''a pointless exercise'' to
kill the ducks. And many experts agree it is a foolish waste of money
and time: ''A bit of political face-saving in the bird world,'' as one
put it.
Jean-Claude LeBrun, a member of the hunter's organisation in Central
France, said: ''The ruddy ducks are already well-established here and
shooting them in England is not going to make any difference to the
situation here, or in Spain.
''The scientists forget that you cannot stop a success or rescue a
failure in the natural world. The British are at fault for letting the
birds escape. It is too late for them to do anything about it now.''
But Gwyn Williams, Head of Species and Habitat Policy for the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, said: ''Regretfully, the shooting
programme is necessary and we fully support it.''
Dr Hughes said: ''We are asking landowners in England at the moment
whether they will give permission for culling. At present there are no
plans for any culling operations in Scotland.''
British and other EU governments and the conservation organisations
are behind the plan to kill off the ruddy duck, but while they have been
seriously discussing the problem in northern Europe, the ducks have
jumped ahead of them and reached the south. The governments of Spain,
Italy, and Greece -- which are much more influenced by hunters -- are
less likely to enforce the killing orders, which have been described as
''ornithological racism''.
Meanwhile, the English racial-purity squad will be out all summer in
pursuit of the bird which American bird books describe as ''small and
stubby . . . in swimming, the tail is often held up at a jaunty angle''.
Duck-hunters know them as stifftails -- as as rapid flyers, with
chestnut-brown bodies and black-and-white heads.
Unlike most ducks, the ruddy is particularly vulnerable twice each
year, when it moults all its wing feathers at once and becomes
flightless for about two weeks. At these times, in August and again in
late winter, the ducks can be pursued on the water until they are
exhausted.
The cost of getting rid of these delightful birds is going to be high.
At the last count, the official gunners had downed just 126 ducks at a
cost of #100,000 (including the scientific reports needed to justify the
exercise).
The operation is based at the Wildfowl Trust in Gloucestershire, from
which the ruddy ducks originally escaped. As one member of the staff put
it: ''I'm afraid the late Sir Peter Scott is lying rather uneasily in
his grave after all this fuss.''

QUESTION: What happens when a team with one point from three league
games, and no goals scored, travels to meet another with no points, but
with one goal scored?
The answer will be provided at Firhill today as Hamilton entertain, if
that's the right word, St Johnstone. And with both sides propping up the
division -- surprisingly considering their form last season -- there
probably will not be many frills around Maryhill.
Paul Sturrock, the St Johnstone manager, probably summed it up best
when he said: ''We are now in a must-win situation. We require a
positive victory to restore confidence. The defence have not been
playing that badly, but when there are no goals going in from up front,
it affects their confidence too.''
Saints will be without Kevin McGeowne, sent off last week, but on the
positive side, central defender Jim Weir -- out since March with a
pelvic and hernia problem -- played for an hour in a reserve match on
Thursday, although Sturrock indicated that he was not ready for a full
first-team return. Substitute, maybe?
Accies have Scott McCulloch out with a broken collar bone, and
Crawford Baptie banned after his red card last week.
Leaders Dunfermline have Craig Robertson fit again for the visit of
Clydebank to East End Park. Bankies, after their draw with Dundee last
week, probably will field the same side. The Dens men, however, will
have Morten Wieghorst back to influence the midfield in one of the day's
most intriguing games -- a visit to Greenock Morton.
It will be a nostalgic trip for manager Jim Duffy. He was at Cappielow
from 1982 to '85, having been signed by Benny Rooney, and was the first
player to be transferred when present manager Allan McGraw took over.
No hard feelings, though. It was in Duffy's contract that if the
Cappielow side were relegated, he could move if a premier division side
for him. Dundee did just that. ''Same again'' is the Morton answer to
team selection, provided Finn Janne Lindberg recovers from a knock
received in the Hampden international.
Dundee United face a buoyant St Mirren side at Tannadice. Manager
Billy Kirkwood will miss the services of the injured Sandy Robertson,
David Hannah, Mark Perry, and Craig Brewster, but he does have Billy
McKinlay back from Scotland duty, and Brian Welsh returning after
injury. Saints, according to manager Jimmy Bone, are ''along similar
lines.''
Dumbarton, despite losing to Dunfermline last week, are ready to face
an Airdrie side who have had better starts.

<TEXT>
CHRIS Eubank has not forgotten the most significant whack he took in
his first WBO super-middeweight title encounter with Steve Collins in
Ireland five months ago.
Strangely, it was not propelled by Collins, but by his own trainer
Ronnie Davies -- an angry and resounding slap across the face at the end
of the tenth round for letting the Dubliner off the hook.
Eubank, struggling to keep his title, floored Collins with a
right-hand, but when the opportunity came to finish the fight, he posed
instead of punching.
Collins escaped and was able to march off with Eubank's title and
unbeaten record. But Eubank pledges no such reprieve in the #1.6m
rematch before a partisan 20,000 Irish crowd at the Pirc Ui Chaoimh
Gaelic football stadium tonight.
Eubank knows he blew it, but the combination of fatigue hastened by a
virus infection, and Collins' pre-fight mental victory all contributed
to the tactically-aware Irishman's victory.
Some bad bad feeling exists between the two fighters and Eubank said:
''This man should not be in my company. He's said bad things. I'm a good
man -- I recognise good and bad people.''
Like Eubank, 31-year-old Collins is not even considering the prospect
of defeat. He will again have hypnotherapist Tony Quinn at his side to
ensure the mental processes are as sharp as his fighting reflexes,
carrying him through the pain barriers.
Said the Irishman: ''I'm better prepared than for the first fight. I
have changed my diet, and I have worked harder. I'm bigger, stronger,
and my stamina has improved. Everything has improved.''
Eubank has taken on a new determination. He has been showing a
calmness, despite his anger, in the build-up, a kind of armed truce,
waiting for this vital assignment.
Eubank knows he has had to get into peak condition to climb this
personal mountain -- nothing else will do. And with Eubank in his
present mood, he could finish off Collins by the eighth round.

DAVID Coulthard was upbeat yesterday after having seized provisional
pole position for tomorrow's Italian Grand Prix, the Scot predicting
that he was going to win the race.
He knows that Monza would be the perfect place to end his search for a
maiden victory -- in front of the fanatical fans he could be driving for
next season. ''It would be a good place to win for the first time,''
said Coulthard. ''It certainly would be for the fans if I was going to
Ferrari.
''I have a pretty fixed idea where I will be going next season, but I
can't say at the moment. In the next few weeks people will find out.''
Coulthard is poised for a move to either Ferrari or McLaren following
his departure from Williams, with his destination to be unveiled when
both teams announce their driver line-ups early next month.
Michael Schumacher has said he would prefer Coulthard as a partner at
Ferrari, while the McLaren move could be affected by Alain Prost's
possible comeback.
Coulthard dominated the opening qualifying session yesterday, although
the next three drivers all are within six-tenths of a second.
Ferrari's Gerhard Berger only prevented a Williams 1-2 by claiming the
second quickest time in the dying seconds from Damon Hill, with
Schumacher fourth.
''I am going to have to go a lot quicker to defend my position in
tomorrow's session. It will be an interesting battle,'' said Coulthard,
who shrugged off an early spin to clock 1min.25.516sec.
Hill, in need of a win to reduce Schumacher's 15-point championship
lead, said: ''David is fired up, but there is more to come from me. I
expect him to be trying to impress because he wants to get himself a
drive for next year. But it's a good thing that he is showing what he is
capable of.''
When the Monza testing was over, Schumacher spoke of the possible
link-up with Coulthard at Ferrari: ''I have a very good relationship
with David,'' said the German. ''I would have no problem if he was in
the team. Whether it's going to happen or not is not up to me, but he
did a very good performance today.''

* A WEEK or so back we described the McEwan crash preventer chip which
should make parking less of a gamble in tight spaces. Now a Surrey firm
has developed a cheap system for making light planes keep their distance
in ever more crowded skies. It uses solar cells costing less than a
fiver as a simple and effective device for preventing mid-air
collisions.
In the last 25 years there has been an increasing number of air
crashes between light planes, many of which could have been prevented if
the aircraft had been carrying some sort of automatic warning device.
Such systems are available for commercial aircraft, but are
prohibitively expensive for use in most small planes.
The CAA's Safety Regulation Group commissioned Smith System
Engineering to examine the potential of using solar cells and modern
microprocessors as an alternative to the expensive systems. Their idea
was simple: a cheap device based on the automatic detection of another
aircraft's flashing lights.
Smith came up with an idea which involves an array of eight solar
cells arranged in a pattern to cover above, below, and all round the
aircraft.  Each detector's field of view overlaps its neighbour and is
designed only to pick up rapid strobe flashes and ignore background
signals from the sun, moon, or headlights. It would also detect distant
aircraft but only warn the pilot of close encounters.
The signals would be amplified and fed to the processor which would
work out the degree of alarm and display the direction of possible
danger on a small graphic screen. Smith have so far run successful
trials on light aircraft, helicopters, and military aircraft and in all
cases the system, even in the worst visibility conditions, detected
close planes early enough to give much more than the 12 seconds minimum
response time needed by pilots to react.  The Smith crash preventer
should be on wingtips after full prototype trials.

SCIENTISTS are studying survival instincts of the humble cockroach,
the Harry Houdini of the insect world, to learn how their brains
translate sensory clues into a getaway plan. Their findings could help
design robots and circuits for guiding vehicles.
In the neuroscience laboratory of Christopher Comer, professor of
biological sciences at Illinois University in Chicago, researchers using
high-speed video cameras and working with hundreds of cockroaches have
discovered that the insects can sense an approaching threat via three
different sensory inputs: wind currents, sight, and the touch of an
antenna.
As soon as they sense danger, they scutter for cover and disappear in
a flash. The aim of the research is not to find ways of catching the
vermin, but to understand how the cockroach brain processes information.
An understanding of the brain's neural circuitry could eventually help
engineers design better electronic circuits to guide cars and machinery
and even the movement of prosthetic devices for humans.
Comer says: ''If we know how signals in the nervous system encode, for
example, 'move your arm to the left', then some day we might be able to
build better artificial hands and legs that operate with input from the
human brain''.
His team have recently turned their attention to a vertebrate, the
frog, to learn how its brain operates under similar conditions. They
studied the frog's ''feed or flight'' behaviour to learn how a frog
knows which direction to turn before it jumps, either towards food or
away from a predator.
While wind currents could alert even a blind cockroach to an intruder,
vision is crucial to the frog's ability to leap out of harm's way or
catch dinner. A visual centre in the frog's brain, called the optic
tectum, controls both its ability to turn towards a food source and away
from a predator.
The researchers found that the frogs rotated faster when turning away
from a predator than when turning to catch prey, indicating that two
different neural pathways are involved in processing the frog's reaction
to food or foe.
We humans, on the other hand, have a different sensory input to let us
learn, at a very early age, when food is available. It's called a
mother. When she says our tea's out . . . we come running.
* REJECTION by a female is something most males experience at some
time or other in their lives. Now scientists have discovered rejection
is not something only for hopeful romantics. It happens on a genetic
level and it's a serious business when it comes to tissue transplants.
The researchers, from Britain, France and USA have made an important
genetic discovery which could prove vital in helping prevent rejection
in transplant surgery.
Tissue rejection is the major problem in transplantation and happens
when a patient's immune system attacks the donated organ. While doctors
screen for major tissue types to get as close a match as possible, but
so far they have been unable to screen for genetic differences which can
cause transplants, particularly of bone marrow, to fail.
Now the scientists from the Medical Research Council have discovered
that genes hold the clue to rejection when female patients' immune
systems attack male-donor tissues. The MRC team believe their work may
help prevent graft-versus-host disease which is a common problem in bone
marrow transplants, and even might have implications for the treatment
of other diseases including cancer.
The researchers discovery came when they used inbred mice which were
genetically identical apart from their gender. By a process of
elimination they found the specific gene on the male Y chromosome that
would be immediately recognised by the female immune system and then
attacked as an invader.
In fact, the gene tells male cells to produce a specific peptide
molecule which stick to the surface of the cells and act, according to
the MRC, like a red rag to a bull on the female immune system.
Hopefully, subsequent developments will help prevent tissue rejection
and perhaps provide clues to auto-immune diseases like insulin dependent
diabetes where the immune system wrongly attacks parts of its own body.
One of the scientists, professor Elizabeth Simpson, said: ''If we can
understand what makes the difference between being attacked or ignored,
then we have the potential to intervene and stop the rejection of
transplants. And if we know how small changes in cancer cells could make
the immune system recognise and attack them, then we could help the body
destroy more tumours.''
* APPLE's new Quad Speed CD-ROM, the 600e, launched this summer, gives
users access to a ''TV-like'' experience for multimedia users.
The new CD is twice as fast as Apple's previous generation which takes
users onto the latest multimedia application including full screen full
motion video. The new Quad Speed has a 356k cache memory allowing burst
transfers at 5.1Mb per second which is a significant time reduction
which gives a much richer TV screen appearance. It's also compatible
with Kodak Photo CD discs and lets users view photos on screen or

AYR'S football team have never achieved the success occasionally
enjoyed by the teams in other comparable towns.
It might be too much to hope for a return to the premier-division
status that they last enjoyed in 1978, but the fans certainly expect a
bit better than the situation at present, where Ayr United have only one
point after three games in second-division campaign.
Following relegation from the middle division to the basement, Ally
MacLeod led them to the Division 2 championship seven years ago, and it
was only this summer that the fans once again found themselves
supporting a team that had become downwardly mobile.
With the departure of player-manager Simon Stainrod, recent signing
Gordon Dalziel has become caretaker-manager.
This week he appealed to the fans to be true United supporters and to
stop the jeers. ''There's no point in coming along to destroy players,''
he said. The appeal sounds reasonable but there are not many sets of
fans blessed with limitless patience, and he can expect only a short
respite unless the team improves.
Their visitors today are Forfar, and the danger man is David Bingham,
whose 46 goals for his club have come in just more than 100 games.
Kevin Drinkell believes that his Stirling Albion team need a killer
touch. However, they have conceded five goals in their past two games
and perhaps his defence requires attention.
Today Albion visit Stenhousemuir, who are bound to test them.
Broadwood fans will see Charlie Nicholas in action again as Clyde
entertain Berwick, while Queen of the South meet Stranraer at Dumfries.
Clydebank defender Derek Crawford's move to Stranraer is on hold until
he recovers from a ligament injury suffered in a reserve game earlier
this week.
Andy Dornan believes his Montrose team are giving away silly goals.
Their hosts today, East Fife, are top of the division and don't need
much help in the scoring department.
In Division 3, Brechin City will have to watch Ross County's tricky
winger Billy Ferries if City are to avoid a second-successive home
defeat.
Caley Thistle are still winless this season, and manager Steve
Paterson is already under fire. His players at least should be aware
that Queen's Park hit four goals in the corresponding fixture at
Inverness last year.
East Stirlingshire may be foot of the table but they still could test
Jim Leishman's unbeaten Livingston.

KEITH, the league leaders, face Fraserburgh this afternoon without the
services of manager Jim Hamilton, who has a more pressing match to
attend -- his daughter's wedding.
Hamilton will forsake his usual place in the dugout to give away
daughter Leigh, who marries Malcolm Glennie in Peterhead, and he joked:
''If I'd planned ahead a bit they could have tied the knot in the centre
circle at half-time.
''Seriously, though, there are some things that come before
football.''
Jim Hamilton Jr, the Dundee striker who has hit six goals already this
season, will not be able to make his sister's wedding, but will travel
up later today.
Cove Rangers face a 450-mile trip to visit Wick Academy, but chairman
Alan McRae has forked out for overnight accommodation ahead of the tie.
Elsewhere, Elgin take on Forres in the Moray derby, while Huntly make
a treacherous journey to play unpredictable minnows, Rothes.
Peterhead have a long trip to Brora Rangers, Clach play Lossiemouth
away, and Nairn play host to Deveronvale.

* CRAY Electronics, the supercomputer people have teamed up with
Superscape, the virtual reality folk, to teach bomb disposal experts how
to become experts without paying dearly for elementary mistakes. In bomb
disposal, the first mistake can be the last.
Now students can make mistake time after time by using virtual
reality. If they cut the wrong wire, they live to tell the tale, and
learn where they went wrong. The V R team has an electronic robot with
tracks and arms and a camera. The operators practice bomb disposal by

make a mistake, the screen only blanks out.
* GENETICALLY manipulated cotton plants are being bred to grow their
own ''polyester'' in the hope of developing a completely natural
material which breathes like cotton and has the shrink resistance of man
made fibre.
Because some plants produce their own synthetic polyester fibres,
biotechnologists have taken the poly-genes and inserted them into cotton
cells. The technique is so precise that the polyester fibres grow
through the centre of the cotton fibres to give a composite which feels
soft and natural, but has a stay-pressed gene which would make the
material more durable and tougher in the wash. Like Tencel, the new
fabric developed by Courtaulds, it's just another advance made by
scientists who see the potential of plants as ecological manufacturers
with less pollution potential than the petrochemical industry.
* THE streets of London are almost rich enough in precious metals to
make it worthwhile mining them. Not paved with gold, but platinum, and
it's all down to the move towards cleaner air. The cause of the increase
of platinum dust is the proliferation of catalytic converters which use
the metal to trap hazardous emissions from cars. The platinum dust
emerges form exhausts and literally litters busy streets, scientists
have found. So far they have measured more than 30 parts per billion,
which is about six times less than the economic ration in a commercial
mine. But in the next five years, the number of cars with catalysers are
expected to soar by about six times. Street sweepers could be kings of
the roads.
* DEADLY scorpions could get a better press, thanks to agents in their
poison which could be used to cure some nerve diseases. The scorpion
toxins, some of them enormously powerful, are based on amino acids, the
basic building blocks of all life. They contain proteins which fit into
nerve receptors and block their function, causing paralysis and death to
the scorpion's prey. Now scientists are working on ways to remove the
deadly element, while keeping the key molecular shape (much like the
work described in the main Frontiers article on Dr Low's research in
Dundee) which could lead to the development of a wide range of drugs
because the ability to block receptors is vital in the treatment of a
number of diseases.
* MODERN technology is saving the dinosaurs. It seems that a priceless
collection of dinosaur bones in the Natural History Museum is in danger
of disintegration because iron compounds in the rock have started to
rust. Now palaeontologists in the museum are using techniques used to
restore paintings to apply chemicals which neutralises the chemical
reaction which causes the rust and will hopefully prevent the Jurassic
monsters from becoming extinct once more.
* DUTCH scientists are experimenting with soundwaves to help deal with
oil spillages and contaminated ground. At the moment, the only cure for
oil-polluted ground is to send in diggers to scoop up the soil, but
sometimes that involves demolishing buildings to clear the mess. Now the
scientists are using sound waves to break up droplets of oil which can
then be flushed out using a water pump. So far they've succeeded in
getting up to 70 per cent of the oil from contaminated soil and they're
now working on a  full-scale clean up operation.

RANGERS may have a Scottish-Russian double act on from the start in
their premier-division match with Raith Rovers at Ibrox this afternoon,
an appropriate pairing in that the two countries seem certain to top
Group 8 of the European Championship.
Oleg Salenko, bought from Valencia for #2.5m, has been working hard to
make up the gap and fitness between himself and his colleagues, who had
the benefit of the full pre-season torture. He had a groin strain during
the week, but he is fit and ready if manager Walter Smith decides to
give him his chance from the beginning.
That became a distinct possibility with the news that Mark Hateley is
out of the match because of a knee injury. That leaves three strikers,
as well as Brian Laudrup, in the pool. Either Ally McCoist or Gordon
Durie could begin, but it is also possible that Smith will opt for both,
especially if he elects to give Laudrup a further rest before the
European campaign gets underway in earnest next Wednesday.
Smith seemed to be contemplating such a plan, which included Paul
Gascoigne, too, after these two made their returns following injury to
their respective international sides during the week. ''It is difficult
coming back in an international game,'' he said, ''and I will see how
both are tomorrow before we decide.''
He probably will leave out midfielder Charlie miller, who was injured
during training with the Under-21s earlier in the week.
The manager, pointing out that this match signals the start of a very
difficult period, still feels that it is just what his team needs at
this point. ''We should be pushed at this stage, and I think Raith
Rovers will start the test. They will have safety in the league as their
target for this season and that will make them difficult to overcome as
they have already shown with two narrow results against Celtic.''
What is required, according to Smith, is a performance to match that
desire of Raith - ''certainly a better one than our last home game
against Stirling Albion.''
Neither he nor Raith manager, Jimmy Nicholl, will allow himself to
think about the European exercises of next week -- Rangers meet Steaua
Bucharest in Romania on Wednesday, while Raith face Akranes in the UEFA
Cup on Tuesday night at Stark's Park -- until the league event is over,
but both would like a decent result to send them into the big adventure.
Hearts and Falkirk meet in game being hyped as a Jim Jefferies special
event, a meeting between his new team and his club of the past five
years.
Jefferies is trying his best to reduce the heat by emphasising his
regard for Falkirk, which is unquestioned, and maybe the Brockville fans
will allow him that much, even if he left them in the end.
Fraser Wishart and Craig Levein are out injured but Jefferies has
plenty of options, including Gary Locke and Alan Johnston, two adaptable
young players. He beleives Derek Ferguson, Falkirk's new signing from
Sunderland, will give them a lift.
His successor, John Lambie, is without suspended keeper Tony Park.
Hibs have Keith Wright and Gareth Evans fit again, with suspended pair
David Farrell and Willie Miller also available, but midweek Under-21
star Kevin Harper is suspended. They travel to meet a Kilmarnock side
missing Colin McKee, Steve Maskrey, and Billy Findlay.
Motherwell full back Rob McKinnon is a 50-50 chance to play against
Partick Thistle at Fir Park.
* JUVENTUS striker Gianluca Vialli claims that he not play again for
Italy.
The player has been upset by remarks made by Arrigo Sacchi, even
though the Italian coach indicated that Vialli would have been called up
for Wednesday's European Championship qualifier against Slovenia if he
had been fit.
Sacchi, who has had numerous disagreements with the outspoken and
sometimes eccentric Vialli, said last week that he had spoken to the
player about his return to the national team and had discussed his
recall with other Italy players.
However, Vialli, whom he has in the past accused of disrupting the
cohesion of the national team, said he was upset to hear that his
playing for Italy was dependant on his team-mates' approval. ''I would
never have thought that the other players would have to approve me
before I could be called up to the national team,'' said Vialli.
''Maybe it's cowardice, maybe its bravery, but after a sleepless night
I took the decision to end this soap opera. I could never feel at home
in that kind of atmosphere.''

RESEARCH by a Dundee team on molecular structure could hold the key to
developing designer drugs to combat cancers and killer viruses. The
Dundee team, experts on using computer analysis to map the crystalline
structure of bio-active molecules, are working in a three-way
collaboration with scientists in Spain and Canada. The joint venture is
the result of a three-year Internet connection which has led to the
publication of a number of joint papers between Dr John Low of Dundee
University's Applied Physics Department and colleagues from Jaen in
Spain and Guelph in Canada.
The three-way partnership is necessary because each team are
specialists in different fields. The Spanish connection began when Dr
Justo Cobo of Jaen contacted John Low for help in analysing new
molecules developed in their department. The molecules were known to be
biologically active, but in order to establish their potential for drug
action on the body, scientists need to know their shape.
John Low explains: ''Some of these new compounds produced in Spain
have great potential as anti-viral agents. They could be biologically
active against cancer or leukemia. All of them are compounds similar to
AZT, the anti-Aids drug. My job is to work out the structure by
analysing where each atom is with respect to its neighbours.
''We use computer analysis which can give us a 3-D representation of
the crystalline structure, and we can see the differences between
compounds that work and those which don't. The structure of such
molecules and the positioning of atoms is what makes them biologically
active. Each of them can be exactly like a key, fitting into molecular
structures within the body and turning processes on and off.
''These compounds are tested for their pharmacological activity. Once
they are tested, knowing the shape and structure helps us realise why
the compounds work the way they do, and that in turn holds out the
promise of refining the structures to produce more effective drugs
tailored to act like real keys in biological locks.
''The Canadian team use X-ray diffraction on the crystals and we use
their work for our analysis which shows the structure.
''The final results are sent to the US National Cancer Institute in
Maryland who have an interest in anti-cancer compounds. They can then
identify the potential for drug use.
''So far our collaboration has solved the structure of more than a
score of compounds, some of which have potential for drug action.''
The Scots presence at the forefront of this new technology is very
strong. George Ferguson of Guelph University in Canada is a Glasgow
graduate. Dundee's pedigree in complex molecular structure analysis is
also well-established. Their team of Wilson and Gosling were at the
cutting edge of the field in work which supported Crick and Watson's
double helix model for DNA.

* YOU too can be a professional film-maker, as the boss of Lakedown
Fishing Club knows. You may ask: Who? And you would be right to. He's
the lead singer of the former wild men of rock, The Who.
Despite having insisted on passing on before knocking on a bit, he's
looking distinctly mature, and if we say he's a wee fly man, it's only
because he's an expert at casting his lure upon the waters, for trout of
course.
Roger Daltry is making a film of trout fisheries and in collaboration
with pro cameraman and fellow angler Trevor Lyward filming the action at
50 top fisheries, using the latest JVC professional GY-X2 camcorder. The
work is now undergoing off-line editing through the JVC 22 series edit
suite and the final product, an audio-visual guided tour of what has
been described as the top fisheries, will be published under the title
The Fly Fisherman's Eye.
Daltry and Lyward say that camcorder and editing system are both very
impressive.
''Even the off-line edits, making a straight copy of the master and
then putting it down on to a master edit, the quality is still good
three generations down,'' the singer says.
JVC's Ian Liddiard says: ''They had a deadline and a great deal of
material to shoot and edit. As professional film-makers and the most
appropriate equipment to achieve the job they want to do.''
Well might he be a wealthy rock star. The camcorder and edit suite
come in at a hefty #23,750, so it's definitely not for amateurs,
although JVC say that an equivalent professional camcorder would cost at
least twice that. Will we see the fruits of their labour? Will we want
to? According to Daltry, his homeland has some of the best trout
fisheries in the world, and he's talking about England.
Now if he wanted some real fishing action, he'd have brought his
expensive toy up north, wouldn't he?

As scientists prepare to see out the midge, Special Travel
Correspondent Katie Wood explains why it's time to make preparations to
see in the new year
IT MAY seem a bit early to start thinking about Hogmanay, but if you
want to book accommodation in Edinburgh to enjoy the capital's third
Hogmanay festival, now is the time to do it. The five-day jamboree will
feature classical music, loads of kids activities, ceilidhs, balls and
bands. The festivities kick off with a torchlight procession on Friday
December 29. Advance info is now available from the Edinburgh and
Scotland Information Centre on tel: 0131 557 1700. Tickets for confirmed
events can be purchased now.
* TRAVEL by rail in France is now bookable through any travel agent on
the Sabre computer database (and that's most of them). So if you want to
book a seat on the Paris-Nice, or any of SNCF's great journeys, pop into
your local travel agent.
* HERTZ is offering a daily hire car rate of just #49.50 for all
British Airways domestic travellers.
* BRITISH Airways Holidays is cutting some prices by as much as #1000
in their Caribbean brochure for 1996. Based on BA flights they are
offering 30,000 flexible holidays, including a range of cruising, single
and multi-centre holidays. One-way free Club upgrades are available on
selected Star Clipper Cruises, and there's #99 Club World upgrades on
selected departures on six Sandals holidays. Prices start at #475 for a
week in Antigua in Easter '96. Most importantly for the Scots there's
free domestic connections to all destinations from all Scottish
airports. See travel agents for brochures.
* KUONI Travel has launched its Kuoni Three brochure detailing the
firm's best value holidays. Some good prices for '96 are beach holidays
in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt for #399, and a good Caribbean Cruise for
#899 with kids at #249. No single supplements on this one, so it's a
good deal for solo travellers. Also Bali is offered using BA flights
with no regional departure supplements. Travel agents have brochures.
* IF you're looking for a British holiday this summer here are some
last-minute deals from British Holidays (tel: 0345 508 508). Seton Sands
Holiday Village in East Lothian seven nights for #250; Wemyss Bay
Holiday park in Renfrewshire: a week for #239, or Quay West Holiday park
in New Quay, Wales, where a week costs #265. These prices give you
privilege passes to the range of sports and entertainments on offer and
prices are based on four people sharing a holiday home, equipped with
fitted kitchen, bathroom and lounge with TV.
* SCIENTISTS are trying to create midge-free zones in the countryside
in a bid to reduce the insect's summer onslaught on walkers and
tourists. New trials by the Forestry Commission and Dundee University
are introducing naturally occurring organisms to kill or reduce the
impact of the pest. Nematodes could be the key -- these highly specific
parasites of insects which do not harm other organisms are already used
to protect food crops and now all hopes are pinned on them to reduce
Scotland's summer enemy.
Just imagine it -- a midge-free West Coast in August. You'd never need
another foreign holiday!
* THERE may be plenty of shopping days before Christmas, but if you
want a Christmas holiday, now's the time to get booking. Page &amp; Moy have
some well priced deals just now. How about a Scottish House Party --
just #269 for four nights; or the Austrian Alps for #325 for a week? If
you want some UV rays at Christmas they're offering Goa for #579 a week,
or Hawaii and the West Coast of America for #899. For a copy of their
festive breaks brochure call them direct on 0116 -- 2524444.
* KUONI has launched a dedicated Australia and New Zealand brochure
with some competitive prices, such as a seven-night stay with BA/Quantas
flights for just #799 in Sydney. Clients can enjoy tailor-made
itineraries at package prices, and free regional flights for Scots, so
it will cost you the same from Glasgow/Edinburgh as from London. If
you're heading Down Under call into travel agents for this brochure.
* FIFE-based Florida Suncentre has added more than 300 homes to its
summer programme of villa holidays throughout Florida. In addition
luxury villas with private pools on the Gulf of Mexico have been reduced
by more than #150, and in Sarasota, one bedroomed apartments are
available all summer for just #199 a week. Tel 01383 820999.
* KNIGHT Air is not a familiar name yet, but it soon could be if
you're Aberdeen based. The firm is offering flights to Southampton,
Belfast and the Isle of Man from the Granite City and a three times
daily service to Leeds/Bradford. Prices are competitive. For
information, call 0345 626489.
* IF the pressure's on to get to Disneyland Paris, check out the deal
currently on offer by Leger Holidays. Based on coach travel you can get
to and from the theme park, have two nights B &amp; B in Paris, a full-day
entrance to Disneyland for just #144 for adults and kids between three
and 11 years paying #49. You won't get better value than this. Call
Leger Holidays on 01709 839839.
* FOR a budget holiday in Northern England you could do a lot worse
than try out the youth hostels. You don't have to be a youth, and some
of their bases are far from basic; accommodation is based in everything
from country mansions to remote cottages. Call 01629 825850 for a
brochure.

SINCE the Californians invented the mountain bike, millions have been
bought in Britain. The proportion that ever venture off the asphalt is
probably about as low as for 4X4 vehicles. If your family has expensive
lumps of chrome --mostly with indexed gears etc, which seldom get
further than the local cycleway -- have you ever wondered what it would
be like to ride in the wilds?
The small isle of Kerrera, off the Argyll coast opposite Oban, offers
a wonderful test circuit for those who want to explore the potential of
their mountain bikes -- and their own muscles. It is wild, beautiful,
challenging without being intimidating, and supremely accessible; and it
has the unique charm of a small island community. It is also almost
car-free.
A small ferry operates on demand between 9am and 5pm from Gallanach,
two miles south of Oban on the coast road. It is kind of full with two
bikes and four passengers, but the crossing is so short that a return
trip can be made in minutes if your party has more than two bikes. The
return trip is #3 per person, bike included. Best to confirm details
with Oban Tourist Office. (Bikes can be hired in Oban.)
Kerrera is a joy. Once you are riding, it seems a lot bigger than
7.5km x 3km, but that is its maximum length and width. It has about 15km
of tracks to explore, which took me a pleasant four-and-a-half hours,
including plenty of time for pottering, picnicking, and birdwatching.
The surfaces of the roads will help you understand why mountain bikes
were invented.
From the jetty, follow the track south-west along the sheltered east
coast. On my recent trip, a profusion of wildflowers scented the way --
meadowsweet, iris, and foxglove -- with roses, honeysuckle and flowering
currant around the few houses.
The highest point on the island, Carn Breugach (189m), can be climbed
from the shore at the Little Horse Shoe, a scramble which gives
rewarding panoramas of the Firth of Lorn and Loch Linnhe.
Near the southernmost point lies Gylen Castle, a ruin dating from the
sixteenth century. Here, wheatear abound. Other birds to be seen include
buzzards, yellowhammers, grey wagtails, meadowpipits, and peregrine
falcon, of which more below.
At the sad ruin of Ardmore, the track becomes a path, and for a short
stretch becomes a real test of mountain-biking prowess. The more demure
may prefer to walk. It heads north near the exposed west coast, and
occasional sounds of seabirds suggests nesting colonies, although I did
not check these out. Here thyme abounds to scent the way.
I stopped on a knoll below Torbhain Mor for my lunch, and was rewarded
by the sight of a peregrine hovering before plummeting on what appeared
to be a baby rabbit, only yards away. If you fancy a different sort of
exercise, Torbhain is steep on its west flank, and offers an interesting
wee scramble near the top. Again, the views are rewarding.
A descent to the west coast at Barr nam boc Bay puts your brakes to
the test, and the bay rings with the peeps of oystercatchers. The track
up eastwards from Barnabuck, with its ancient sycamore plantation, will
stretch your muscles, and teach you why mountain bikes have such low
gears. As you near the summit you may see some fine ponies from the
riding stables at Slaterich, and by this stage your legs may be telling
you that you'd have been wiser to ride a pony.
A track past Slaterich again  gives access to the west coast at
Slatrach Bay, and another path goes north, with an enchanting kilometre
along the machair of Oitir Mhor, before crossing to the east coast at
Ardantrive Bay, with views across to Oban. The return is by the same
route, then downhill steeply past Bailliemore which seems to be the only
place on the island with more than two adjacent houses. The fine wee
Victorian primary school (four pupils) sits on a knoll as you descend
steeply to the ferry.
You will have to wait until you get back to Oban before you can lay
your hands on a beer. A testing and thoroughly rewarding day out, but
not recommended unless you are reasonably fit, and your bike is in good
nick -- especially the brakes.

THE dream became a reality last night in New York when Monica Seles
and Steffi Graf reached the final of the US Open at Flushing Meadow.
Seles, making a glorious return to Grand Slam tennis after a 28-month
competitive absence, was far to good for last year's Wimbledon champion,
Spaniard Conchita Martinez, winning 6-2, 6-2, while Graf, hampered by
physical problems and emotional traumas, battled well to beat Gabriela
Sabatini 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), and set up today's showdown between the world's
co-No.1s.
''Playing against Steffi is going to be fun. It's going to be a great
day whatever happens,'' said Seles between bouts of barely controllable
giggles.
''Just to be in the final, gosh! If someone had told me one year, or
two years ago that I'd have a chance to go out and play great tennis
tomorrow, it's beyond what I dreamed of.''
After having clinched her hard-fought victory over Sabatini, Graf ran
to a courtside box to embrace her mother and her Swiss coach Heinz
Gunthardt. ''I didn't expect to be able to get to the finals, so it
really got to me,'' said Graf about her emotional display.
Sabatini, who lost for the twenty-ninth time to Graf in 40 meetings,
said: ''It's very disappointing. I had many opportunities in the first
and second set and it's very disappointing to miss. I missed shots,
double faulted, and you can't afford to do that.''
Earlier, Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde needed just 68 minutes to
win their first US Open doubles title together when they defeated Alex
O'Brien and Sandon Stolle 6-3, 6-3 in the final. Today's matches:
Men. semi-finals -- Pete Sampras (USA) v Jim Courier (USA), Andre
Agassi (USA) v Boris Becker (Germany).
Women, Final -- Steffi Graf (Germany) v Monica Seles.
* BRITAIN'S Martin Lee failed in his bid to reach the US Open boys
singles semi-finals in New York. The No.11 seed lost to second seed
Nicolas Kiefer 6-0, 2-6, 6-2.

THE house on the hill has decided to give away some tickets -- 13,000
of them for Scotland's final European qualifying match against San
Marino at Hampden.
As Jim Farry, the SFA's chief executive, said last night: ''We have to
say a big thank-you to a lot of people. The International Committee are
considering that these tickets should be given to the likes of the SFA
Travel Club, organised youth clubs and youth groups, as well as
voluntary groups, and of course, the members.''
When you think of the organisational problems involved in any
international at Hampden, and the number of folks involved, it is easy
to see where 13,000 free tickets will go.
Farry added: ''The committee already have indicated that they want me
to draw up a scheme for these tickets. All that is needed now is for the
details to be approved.''
Another ''detail'' still to be approved is that the remaining 24,000
tickets available may be put on sale at a cut price -- yet to be agreed.
Farry and the Scotland squad have been impressed with the ''fiery
passion'' that has come back to Hampden, and again the committee are
expected to agree to a cut-price deal.
It is a welcome diversion from the normally staid, and sometimes
petulant leaders of the Scottish game.
It is also a move which should receive congratulations from the fans.

GOLF ROUND-UP
LOTTA Sorenstam upstaged her elder sister, Annika, the US Open
champion, by taking the halfway lead in the Trygg Hansa Open in Sweden.
With a six-under-par 140 she leads by one from Annika along with Lora
Fairclough and Lotta Neumann, the holder. Leading scores:
140 -- C Sorenstam (Sweden) 71, 69. 141 -- A Sorenstam (Sweden) 71,
70; L Neumann (Sweden) 70, 71; L Fairclough 71, 70. 143 -- M Hageman
(Holland) 72, 71.
Scottish scores: 149 -- J Forbes 76, 73; G Stewart 73, 76.
Non-qualifiers: 154 -- M McKinlay 76, 78. 156 -- C Panton-Lewis 80, 76.
158 -- L Irvine 77, 81.
* SANDY Lyle putted well to survive the cut at the $1.3m Canadian Open
at Glen Abbey, Toronto, yesterday. His level-par 72 for a two-over 146
total trailed halfway leader Bob Lohr by 11. Lyle managed the birdie 4
he thought he needed at the last when a par would have done.
First-round leader Russ Cochran crashed an 80. He, at least, made the
cut unlike course designer Jack Nicklaus, who missed it by a shot with a
6 at the last. Leading scores:
135 -- B Lohr 68, 67. 136 -- A Magee 68, 68. 137 -- J Gallagher 69,
68. Others: 142 -- F Couples 71, 71. 146 -- S Lyle (Scotland) 74, 72; D
Feherty (N Ireland) 71, 75.
* SCOTS Janice Moodie and Mhairi McKay helped Great Britain to a 6-0
win over South Africa yesterday at the Women's Commonwealth Tournament
at Royal Sydney which earned them second overall behind Australia.
* SEAN Connery and partner, fellow actor Michael Medwin were knocked
out of the R and A's Calcutta Cup foursomes at St Andrews. Quarter-final
results:
I A H Syme (11) and W C Wilson (11) beat D F Anderson (8) and C J R
Philip (7), 3 and 2; G L Cornell (8) and G L Cornell Jr (16) beat J T

IT'S been a funny old week, but I wasn't laughing. Defeat at the hands
of Hawick on the first Saturday of our championship defence, then I'm
plastered all over the front page of Scotland's best-selling comic just
because I went to the movies. What is it all coming to when a man can't
go to the pictures without being hounded by the hacks?
OK, here's the truth. The lady in question and I are friends. Yes, we
are going out together, and no, there's no truth in the suggestion that
it's all a ploy to take some of the heat off Will Carling and Princess
Di!
More seriously, though, the kind of press interest that we've
experienced in the last few weeks is maybe an indication of how the game
is going to go as it achieves a higher profile. Footballers have had to
put up with this kind of intrusion for years and, perhaps, rugby players
will have to learn how to deal with it now as well.
That defeat by Hawick really brought home to us how hard it is going
to be to retain our title. We weren't over confident by any means, but
now we know just what it will take if we are not to become one
championship wonders. Maybe in some ways it was the best thing that
could have happened. We now know what it takes. There will be few, if
any, easy games this season, and just to prove that we've got
championship runners-up Watsonians at Myreside today and we've just got
to win.
Despite our defeat nobody should write us off and I can see the
championship being fought out between us, Watsonians, Melrose, Edinburgh
Accies and Boroughmuir, even though, like us, they've started on a
losing note.
This will be a big week for the leagues. We play today, Wednesday
night, and again next Saturday. That's three games within the space of
eight days. The sides that get through these games without injury -- and
those with the strongest pools -- will be those which can take the
challenge on to later in the season.
Rugby can be a tough old game and nobody knows that better than Gary
Armstrong. I was chuffed for Gary when he battled back from the knee
injury which has kept him out of the game for a year. I couldn't believe
it when word filtered through to Bridgehaugh last Saturday night that he
had been injured again after just three minutes of Jed's game against
GHK.
The good news is that he will be back within three weeks once his
sprung rib cartilage is healed. Scottish rugby needs players like Gary.
Whenever I played alongside him for Scotland -- and just like Gavin
Hastings -- you felt that he gave the whole team a lift just by being
there.
He's not going to walk straight back into the Scotland side, because
''Brush'' Redpath was one of the most improved players at the World Cup,
but if anybody can give Bryan a run for his money then it will be Gary.
Given an injury-free run of games, he will be right up there challenging
as the international season approaches.
Finally, I wish it to be known that Stewart Hamilton and I are
just team-mates and good friends. Hammy and I may well have been seen
out together in recent weeks. We may even have been to the pictures
together. However, at this stage in the relationship I would just ask
the media to give us some space.
Hammy is back in the side today and all that I really want to say is
that the big man deserves to get on with playing for Stirling County
without being hounded and pestered by the gentlemen of the press. Thank
you.

THE SRU may be the ultimate administrators of the game of rugby with a
zealous and organised approach to life that's second to none. I must say
I like getting stuck into them, because they are an easy target, but
what seemed to be a quite petty action earlier this week over clearance
for a foreign player has turned out, in my view, to be justified.
Just ask, for example, the members of Bishopton rugby club what they
think of their latest contact with the union and their reply will be
less than favourable. But the outcome has been satisfactory for all
parties.
Last year Bishopton, who play in the second division of the Glasgow
and District League despite being only two years old, had a rather
rumbustious New Zealander, Ben Stock, playing in their back five. Ben
comes from Gisborne, his parents have a deer farm called Braemar, he
wears the kilt, and through working just outside Bishopton he joined the
club and has been an adopted son ever since.
''But we got to thinking after the professionalism question about the
number of foreign players,'' says club president George Hardie. ''I was
sure that we didn't need to do or say anything as Ben had played here
for a whole year, but our secretary wrote to the SRU asking for
guidance. We thought it would be simple.''
Nothing's that simple in life. The SRU's line took the club by
surprise, because this week came the news that, unless Ben received
clearance from his province by yesterday, he would not be allowed to
play today.
''It's all so petty,'' says Hardie. ''And to be frank, we are all
completely fed up with this. As far as I was concerned I was willing to
play Ben whatever the consequences. He is capable of playing higher up
the ladder, but we have enjoyed having him in the side.''
I completely understand George Hardie's reaction, and he was right to
be upset. The Bishopton success story is, of itself, a remarkable one in
that, despite being so young, it has managed to progress both on and off
the pitch.
Last week the club beat Shawlands, a team in its own division, by
53-0. There are floodlights where once there were none, the pitches have
been drained, and the after-match revelries are coming along quite
nicely, thank you very much.
But the SRU informed Hardie that if he played Stock then the Glasgow
authorities would be informed and his club risked expulsion from the
league.
To Bishopton, the SRU's actions will have looked like a slap in the
face to a young club that, under Hardie's guidance and hard work, has
blossomed as few would have suspected.
What happened, of course, is that the Bishopton people worked
themselves into a lather to get the clearance papers from New Zealand.
They thought, quite understandably, that there would be little chance of
getting clearance by this weekend, and then, by chance, Cumbernauld
third XV had to bring the kick-off forward and so Stock, politically I
suppose, was forced to call off as it ''clashed with his work
commitments.''
Everything was all right then. End of story? Well, not quite. What of
the clearance?
I phoned Gregor Nicholson at the SRU, the baddie of the piece. ''What
of Ben Stock and Bishopton RFC?'' I asked with glee, expecting some
typical SRU drivel.
''I have his clearance papers in front of me,'' said Nicholson. ''They
arrived from the NZRFU today.''
Gobsmacked I was. ''Er . . so quickly?''
''Listen,'' said Nicholson. ''How are we to know whether or not the
player had been banned for life in his own country for kicking someone
in the head. It may all sound terribly pedantic, but we have to abide by
the rules and check these things.''
What I rather suspect, too, is that the SRU have been lenient in this
case by ignoring the fact that Stock played all of last season for
Bishopton, and I think that their lenience may be due to the fact that
Bishopton have done so well and are a new club.
Anyway, both parties have ended up winning. The SRU, in retrospect,
were sticklers for the detail, but were probably right. The SRU right? I
must be getting old.

The smaller specialist tour operators deal in a world seldom
experienced by the package tour horde. Here, Jill Crawshaw provides a
guide to the people who can add that little bit of extra holiday magic
This firm demanded to see every room their clients might get. Some
firms see one room, or not even that. So guess who gets my best?
THE entire village seemed to have closed for the season and the inn
where we were supposed to be having lunch on our Champagne Tour was so
unpretentious that we kept driving past it.
And even when we did find it, the general lack of activity in its
simple little bar made us doubt that we would enjoy the feast we'd been
promised.
But the meal did happen and was fit for a king. Monsieur did the
cooking, Madame served. And the outing that followed with plenty of
sampling in the family-owned cellars of Ambonnay was delightful.
I would like to claim that I had discovered it all for myself, but I
had been directed there by one of the smaller specialist tour operators,
in this case, Inntravel, that are so often the unsung heroes of the
travel business.
On another occasion, we arrived on one of the smallest and least known
of the Greek islands, Leros, having flown in to Kos, taken a ferry to
Kalymnos, crossed that island by rickety taxi and sailed to our final
destination by fishing caique to stay in a simple pension among the
olive groves and peach orchards for a week to remember.
Few large companies would be prepared to undertake such intricate
planning, for they know that one taxi driver over-sleeping, or one
captain casting off early could create extra costs that could easily
absorb all the profits.
It is largely only the smaller specialist firms that can supply this
level of personal service and local knowledge. Many are 'direct sell',
with staff or owners who can answer every question in detail, and to
whom customers are more than digits in a computer.
There are drawbacks; the smaller companies generally restrict
themselves perhaps to Manchester and one of the London airports, though
they will of course arrange linking flights, or even tailor-made
holidays to suit. And the specialists are not necessarily the cheapest,
with fewer cut-price and late bargain offers.
''Our aim is to provide quality holidays,'' says Sue Ockwell of AITO,
the Association of Independent Tour Operators -- 150 small companies,
all fully bonded for financial security. ''Our members try to use day
flights only, and provide such extras as perhaps the right Spanish coin
for luggage trolleys at airports.''
With long-haul specialist Elegant Resorts I went on a tour of
inspection with one of their directors; jetlag and the lure of the
beaches was swept aside as she inspected every hotel room.
''This firm demanded to see every room their clients might get,'' the
manager told me. ''Some firms see one room, or not even that. So guess
who gets my best?''
There's a wide variety of these specialised firms -- indeed just about
the only thing they have in common is that they're all different.
* HOLT'S Battlefield Tours runs an annual programme of more than 50
tours to 20 countries worldwide, spanning military history from the
Romans to the Falklands. Guides with relevant military, academic or
specialised backgrounds accompany each tour.
''It's a long way to Tipperary'' is an introductory three or four-day
tour to the main battlefield areas of the Western Front -- the Ypres
Salient, Vimy Ridge and Somme, with diaries, letters and voice
recordings bringing the years alive. By coach from the Victoria Coach
Station in London, the three-day tour in September and October costs
#239, four days #309.
For information call: Holts' Battlefield Tours, The Golden Key
Building, 15 Market Street, Sandwich, Kent CT12 9DA. Tel: 01304 612248.
* VILLAGE France concentrate on the off-the-beaten-track destinations
where the balance of locals to foreigners is comfortably in favour of
the former. They offer all types of accommodation and activities. For
instance, a week's donkey trek in Languedoc, staying overnight in gites,
chambres d'hotes and mountain refuges en route, with all meals, a guide
and cross Channel ferry costs #399. Motorail packages can be arranged.
Holidaymakers can add other activities, or stay-put holidays.
For further information contact La France des Villages, Model Farm,
Rattlesden, Nr Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk IP30 OSY, Tel: 01449 737664.
* CYCLING For Softies offer a flexible programme of cycling holidays
in France, either for tentative beginners, families with young children,
or energetic sightseers. You can stay in one base for a week, meandering
off gently to nearby villages each day, or pedal around the chateaxux of
the Loire, the Dordogne or Charente and Cognac, Beaujolais and Jura, or
the vineyards of the Rhone.
Tours range from ''Whizz'' and ''Adventurer'' to those for ''Super
Softies''. A week's ''Gentle Tourer'' in Provence costs #529 (for hotels
and bike package only). Travel by air, rail or self-drive car can be
arranged.
For further information contact Susie Madron's Cycling Holidays, 2 &amp; 4
Birch Polygon, Manchester M14 5HX, Tel: 0161 248 8282.
* A SPECIALIST within a specialist, Laskarina Holidays picks
away-from-it-all islands, mainly in the Dodecanese, plus Spetses,
Skiathos, Skopelos, Alonissos and Skyros. They took their name from the
Greek heroine Laskarina Bouboulina, a native of Spetses, where they
started their holidays 19 years ago, Laskarina was a privateer who
captured a fleet, and according to legend, started the Greek War of
Independence in 1821.
Many of the firm's properties are traditional houses -- one of them
perched on the rim of an extinct volcano; others are simple apartments
or studios on tiny, laid-back enchanting dots, such as Lipsi. Laskarina
also run painting holidays on Symi. With flights from Manchester or
Gatwick, a week in Lipsi costs from #351.
For information contact Laskarina Holidays, St Mary's Gate,
Wirksworth, Matlock, Derbyshire DE4 4DQ. Tel: 01629 822203/4.
* ''FLYING Claret Weekends'', ''Sherry and Andalucia'' and ''Walking
through Burgundy'' are just some of the appealing sounding tours from
Arblaster and Clarke Wine Tours, accompanied by experts, with visits to
vineyards, cellars, vigneron's homes, chateaux and local festivals.
Accommodation is largely in characterful local hotels.
The firm also organises barge holidays on the Canal du Midi, Provence,
Burgundy and Alsace, from #790-#1160 per person, to include six nights
on board with full board and drinks, open bar, bicycles and daily trips
on the barge's own minibus. Travel is not included, though flights or
self drive through the ''Route des Vins'' can be arranged. The barges
are fully crewed with a captain and cook.
For information contactArblaster and Clarke Wine Tours, Clarke House,
Farnham Road, West Liss, Nr. Petersfield, Hants GU336JQ.
* THE Alternative Travel Group's programme ''The Best of Europe''
offers a pot-pourri of unusual walking holidays in Renaissance Tuscany
and medieval Umbria, in the wilds of Sardinia or Catalonia, or cycling
along Spain's Camino de Santiago, round Italy's Palladian villas, or
along the former Iron Curtain military zone in Bohemia, untouched for
nearly 45 years.
Their most exotic offerings are their spring Orchid Hunt in Sicily and
on the mainland at Gargano and Monti Sibillini, and their Turffle Hunt
in autumn and December. Samplings, cookery demonstrations and visits to
wine estates are included.
A one-week truffle hunt, with most meals and accommodation, in Umbria
is #735. Flights can be arranged.
For information contact The Alternative Travel Group, 69-71 Banbury
Road, Oxford OX2 6PE, Tel: 01865 513333.
* MALLORCA is still one of the best holiday islands in the
Mediterranean -- most of it simple, peaceful and beautiful, with 90% of
its visitors crammed into 10% of its coastline -- which leaves
breathtaking mountain ranges, dozy villages and a delightful interior.
Castaways specialise in these unspoilt areas, using traditional and
civilised hotels and fincas (farms). A week in the little village of
Esporles, on the lower slopes of the Tramuntana mountain range, staying
in La Posada del Marques, the former home of the 16th century nobleman,
still with its tiny chapel and olive press (and with a swimming pool
added) costs #741-#781 B &amp; B, flying in the autumn from Glasgow.
For information contact Castaways, 2-10 Cross Road, Tadworth, Surrey
KT20 5UJ. Tel: 01737 812255.
* AN extensive range of holiday ideas in Iceland and Greenland, winter
tours to Lapland, the Yukon and the North Pole, and special holidays in
Finland, Spitsbergen, Northern Canada and Alaska, are listed by the
10-year-old firm Arctic Experience in their brochure ''The Lure of the
North''.

taking in glaciers, hot springs, waterfalls, and off-the-beaten-track
ice caps. Prices are from #895 (with #20-#40 reductions from Glasgow)
for seven nights' B &amp; B with accommodation in a mixture of mountain
huts, guesthouses and tents. A husky sledge tour in Lapland in winter
costs approximately #1300 full board, for eight days, flying out of
Manchester or London. A three-night weekend in Reykjavik, staying in a
family house on B &amp; B costs #232-#351, with #20-#41 reductions from
Glasgow.
Sister company of Arctic Experience, Discover the World specialises in
wildlife watching holidays from dolphin spotting in Gibraltar to pilot
whales in Tenerife, humpback whales in New England, blue whales in
California and wolves and bears in Romania, as well as a range of
low-cost wildlife breaks in the UK. The firm supports a number of
wildlife charities, including the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Whale
and Dolphin Conservation Society and Elefriends, an anti-poaching
project in Tanzania.
A three-night break based on Gibraltar, with boat trips aboard a
30-foot catamaran, (hopefully) to watch the friendly common dolphins,
and a chance of meeting striped and bottlenose dolphins, costs #371 B &amp;
B from Manchester.

auberges are the hallmarks of the Inntravel programme of holidays,
mainly in France, but also featuring farmhouses in Austria and
Switzerland, fishermen's cottages in the Lofoten Islands and riding and
walking holidays in Spain.
New for autumn, you can learn pottery, ceramics and painting your own
tiles on a ''Traditions, Crafts and Ceramics'' three-night fly-drive
break in Provence, staying at the Hotel Calalou in Moissac for a #497
half-board break from Gatwick, or this can be combined with holidays
touring Provence or the three rivers, the Tarn, Lot and Dordogne.
Cook around France weekends, where, under the supervision of the hotel

* THERE'S a fascinating muddle of German holidays in Moswin Tours
brochures, from city weekends and escorted sightseeing tours, to
farmhouse holidays, and river cruises on the Rhine, Moselle and Elbe,
Dresden, Saxony, Thuringia, the Baltic Coast and the Mecklenburg Lakes
are destinations offered in the former East Germany.
Their special interest holidays will appeal to the energetic and the
eccentric. The narrow gauge steam trains of Saxony are the subject of
one of their eight-day tours. By stagecoach through Bavaria, staying in
ancient inns is another unusual week's outing, while a week's harvesting
in autumn with the wine producers of the Moselle should be alcoholically
bracing, as should brewery weekends in Speyer on the Rhine.
Trips to the Christmas markets, Christmas in the maintains or
Sylvester (New Year) in Berlin or the Moselle round off this year, and
launch 1996.
Travel is by air, coach, rail or self-drive, with cross Channel travel
between Newcastle and Hamburg or Visimar, and Hull/Rotterdam on
Zeebrugge Ferries.
The week's Stagecoach to the Royal Castles of Bavaria, costs #879 B &amp;
B flying Heathrow to Munich, with a #12 supplement from Edinburgh, #67
from Glasgow.
For information contact Moswin Tours, 21 Church Street, Oadby,
Leicester LE2 5DB, Tel: 0116 271 9922.
* ART, music and historic towns galore from cultural tour specialists
Martin Randall; small groups of holidaymakers are accompanied by guest
experts and steeped in the masterpieces of Renaissance palaces, Rococo
painters, Byzantine mosaics and Romanesque Churches, largely in Europe,
though some tours explore Islam and antiquities in the Middle East.
Several holidays focus on a particular theme or artist, among them an
autumn trip of Medici villas and gardens, visiting most of those that
have survived around Florence and Tuscany, charting their development
from little more than fortified farmhouses to grand residences with
classical allusions.
The price of the week's tour, (without travel, which can be arranged),
is #845 to cover hotel accommodation, most meals, entrance fees and
tips.
For information contact Martin Randall Travel, 10 Barley Mow Passage,
Chiswick, London W4 4PM. Tel: 0181 742 3355.
* ALLURING lesser known islands such as the Turks and Caicos,
Anguilla, St Vincent, Peter Island, Virgin Gorda and Necker, St Martin
and St Barths feature in the Elegant Resorts programme, alongside the
more familiar Barbados, St Lucia and Jamaica, where the company offers
tailor-made luxury hotel and villa accommodation.
You can also stay in simpler accommodation in the Plantation House on
unspoilt Bequia, or inns in Grenada or Montserrat. Luxury yachting
holidays of three, four or seven nights can be added on to island based
holidays. Most itineraries are based on the Grenadine or Virgin Islands,
and boats are fully crewed.
A week at the Plantation House on one of my favourite islands, Bequia,
costs from #975 to #1,335 for B &amp; B and flights from Heathrow. A week at
the friendly and relaxed Cobblers Cove, one of my own favourite hotels
in Barbados, costs from #1055 to #1995 (including flights and some
meals).
For information contact Elegant Resorts, 24 Nicholas Street, Chester
CH1 2ER. Tel: 01244 329671.
* AFRICA Exclusive offer holidaymakers the chance to explore parts of
the continent that most other firms don't reach, an experience that can
last a lifetime.
On tailor-made itineraries they strike deep into the skeleton coast of
Namibia, into the heart of Botswana's Okavango Delta, or into Zimbabwe's
most isolated and inaccessible game reserves; holidaymakers who are
teachers, solicitors and clerks in British cities find they can canoe up
the Zambezi, raft in white watr and track lion and elephant on foot in
Zimbabwe. No minibus queues on these holidays in Kenya, Tanzania,
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botwsana and South Africa. Prices of a typical safari
range from around #2,000 for 2 weeks.
For information contact Africa Exclusive, Hamilton House, 66
Palmerston Road, Northampton, NN1 5EX. Tel: 01604 28979.

Fanny Wright was an extraordinary woman who believed that morality had
a place the world, and spent her life trying to establish it. But her
efforts are consigned to the dusty corners of history. Frances Campbell
ponders a seeming inevitability
ELSPETH KING or Frances Wright? I juggle with the two names as I start
this article. Grab the attention is the journalistic rule. Accordingly,
I drop Frances Wright and turn my attention to Elspeth King -- director
of the Smith Art Gallery in Stirling, author of The Hidden History of
Glasgow's Women and centre of a storm of protest five years ago when, as
curator of the People's Palace, she was passed over for the post of
Glasgow's keeper of social history.
Frances Wright was also at the centre of a few controversies in her
day. But she lived 200 years ago. A passionate exponent of the
principles of Robert Owen, she was born in Dundee and travelled in her
twenties to America where she became a popular author and itinerant
lecturer speaking out against slavery, religion, and marriage. Whether
her objection to marriage developed before or after her own experience
of that state is yet to be clarified. But it is worth noting that she
was divorced by her husband, a French doctor who, because of her
unconventional behaviour, was able to have custody of their daughter.
This month Elspeth King will commemorate Frances Wright's birth and
achievements with a talk in the Museum of Religion. An odd venue, it
would seem, given that the event is being sponsored by the Glasgow
Humanist Society who share Wright's views on religion.
But Robin Wood, Chair of the Humanist Society of Scotland, likes the
irony: ''It's a good venue. We used it for our last meeting when we
invited the Salman Rushie Defence League to speak. It seemed appropriate
then because of Fundamentalism and the threat to our freedoms that
poses. Having Elspeth King there is a nice twist.''
A nice twist indeed, seeing that Mark O'Neill, who five years ago got
the job of keeper of social history, is now the Museum of Religion's
curator. However that was not the Humanists' original plan. Robin Wood
explains how he tried to get Dundee to mark the bicentenary since, after
all, it was Frances Wright's birthplace: ''But I kept coming up against
a brick wall. The History Society event asked me if I would like to give
a talk but I am not an expert. I wrote to the chief librarian in Dundee
and received a letter back from the archivist saying Frances Wright was
commemorated with a wall plaque in the Nethergate and an annual entry in
the city guide which says: 'A charismatic speaker and of very handsome
appearance, she exercised considerable influence in her comparatively
short public career'. But that's it. I even contacted BBC Scotland to
see if they were planning a documentary but I just got a letter back
saying my idea had been 'noted'.''
In her Glasgow flat, ensconsed behind a growing folder of photocopies
and notes, Elspeth King considers it a shame that Dundee couldn't do
more. ''It's such a great female city -- with the women working in the
jute mills and all. And yet it sells itself on Discovery, that Boy's Own
adventure thing. It's what's called cultural set-aside.''
Not surprisingly, King agrees with the premise that Anonymous was a
woman, that any woman -- however well-known in her own lifetime -- has
less chance of making it to the history books. But she is visibly put
out when I suggest that she is better known that the subject of her
coming talk. ''It's shameful. I'm only a temporary blip on the horizon.
I've not done anything to be famous for -- other than get up somebody's
nose. Fanny Wright has a solid body of work behind her as a philosopher,
as a person who was going to change society, who really stirred the
society of her times on both sides of the Atlantic.''
Eighteenth-century journals describe an ''Atheistic Demonstration'' in
Glasgow where the company raise their glasses in a toast ''To Miss
Frances Wright and the Female Advocates of Civil and Religious
Liberty''. ''They celebrated the birth of Robert Owen at the time much
as we hold Burns' Suppers today,'' says King, who first heard of Frances
Wright when reading about the female Owenites.
''They were extraordinary women. Really -- the first and last of the
revolutionaries . . . They want to establish a New Moral World because
the corrupt old world with its superstitions and prejudices will never
do for the kind of society they want. And they accept the whole baggage
that comes with that: equality for women, communal child-rearing,
sometimes free-love, equal education -- they want to turn society upside
down and on its head for complete equality. After they pass on nobody
else ever wants to do it again on a big scale. In 1867 women start
petitioning for votes for women and that's when people's hopes for an
equal world are really at an end because then women want to join the
system instead of beating it.''
King's voice takes on a sadness -- as if she were remembering a lost
tribe; I sit stunned at the vision and daring of these people. Michael
Donnelly, King's partner and fellow historian, has already filled me in
on the background of Frances Wright. A granddaughter of the French
Revolution, her parents were wealthy Dundonians and supporters of a
reformist group called ''The Friends of The People'' whose leaders were
transported to Botany Bay. Wright was orphaned at the age of two and
sent to England. But she returned to Scotland when she was 21 and began
mixing with the radical intellectuals of Glasgow University -- including
Professor John Miller, a pioneering socialist who became a source of
Marx's Das Kapital.
Political activity in Scotland was banned at that time and, soon
after, Wright made her first trip to America. In her own writings, she
later recalls what drew her there; ''My attention became riveted on this
country, as on the theatre where man might first awake to the full
knowledge and the full exercise of his powers.''
The word ''theatre'' is telling. As a public speaker, she was a
performer who knew how to hold her audience in thrall. In 1819, a year
after arriving in America, she became the first woman to have a play
produced on Broadway. Called Altorf, it attracted wide audiences. Its
subject was the liberation of the Swiss from Austria.
Back in England in 1821 she published Views of Society and Manners in
America with the intention of opening British eyes to the more
progressive policies of the States. But she was by no means blinded to
her adopted country's faults. By 1824 she was back in America
campaigning against slavery. Inspired by Robert Owen's model village at
New Lanark, she bought land in Tennessee and tried to build a utopian
community of emancipated slaves. Like Owen's experiment, New Harmony in
Indiana, Wright's venture failed -- attacked from the start from every
corner. But she continued as an influential force, editing a newspaper
called the Free Enquirer and going on to lecture tours which excited
ridicule and riots in a period when it was considered scandalous for
women to take the platform.
In 1829 she published A Course of Popular Lectures -- the text of
talks given in New York, Philadelphia and Boston. An old, marbled copy
with torn binding is available in the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, and it
is a delight to read. In it, Wright decries religion as ''the worst
species of quackery'' and as one of the main strongholds against
knowledge -- the other being an ignorant or servile press. Her words
flow like a burn in spate but she is no easy read. Systematic, logical,
reasoned -- she apologises herself for recapitulating basic premises to
the point of tediousness. It is a book you want to take home. To digest
at leisure. But the Mitchell only has it in the Reference Library and it
is not available in the shops.
Yet Frances Wright's autobiography and two biographies have been
published in America. Why do we know so little of her here?
''Because men write history,'' King says with that sadness in her
voice again.
''But don't lose sight of the fact that Scots are generally deprived
of their history,'' Michael Donnelly intervenes. ''That's not an
accident. There are whole bloody chunks . . . black holes. And it tends
to be the culturally and politically relevant areas that are missing.
You'll find very few people know anything about Miller either . . .
don't expect to find any monuments or memorials that commemorate his
name in Glasgow, his home town. It's not just a sexist issue -- it's a
cultural issue.''
''Ah, but folk have written books about Miller,'' counters King. ''And
look at all that's being published to commemorate the Jacobite Rising.
Look at what happens at any centenary or bicentenary. This has been
going on throughout my lifetime from the bicentenary of Burns's birth to
his death -- duly commemorated with substantial publications and
exhibitions . . . and the time comes for Fanny Wright and there's only
one wee voice shouting . . . And that's the Humanists . . .
''I think Fanny Wright should be shocked to find women have moved so
little since her time. Dale Spender, the feminist writer, says we need
to find out why the circle is constantly broken, why women's information
is never passed on to the next generation . . . It's sad that we don't
know our past.''
''That's because you're still not the victors,'' says Donnelly. ''And
the victors write history. You get this tremendous surge to change
society again at the end of the nineteenth century then suddenly
everyone gets elected and joins Parliament -- an unreformed institution
with a House of Lords where people still legislate on the basis of an
accident of birth. That's what the British constitution does -- it sucks
in any new force and then emasculates it. That's why we don't remember
these movements.''
''The Owenite women weren't interested in Parliament,'' adds King.
''They wanted to eradicate it and set up something new, workable, that
didn't become corrupt.''
Before leaving, I ask King about her own religious beliefs. She looks
to heaven and lets out something close to a wail: ''I believe in
museums! I believe in spreading the word of the value of material
culture. I know ideas are important but things are important too. A lot
of us are thirled to our possessions but few of us think enough about
them to see they're properly conserved and passed on to the next
generation.
''And the way museums operate is through the objects. My whole life
has been directed towards trying to improve things in museums, to
interest people in visiting them and joining in the ethos of them . . .
encouraging them to give things to the museum for passing on. I'm trying
to establish a chain going down generations and women's history is part
of that. That's what my life has been directed to.''
A life that may or may not be remembered. Elspeth King has a strong
sense of her own mortality -- but no doubt that comes with the territory
of curator.

<FLAG>SRU TENNENTS CHAMPIONSHIP,</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>976470143</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE game this weekend has the chance to redeem itself. There are
those, including your correspondent, who considered that the eight-team
premiership structure with its 25% attrition rate did not have to mean
that the paying public would be sentenced to a regime of nervy, negative
rugby.
The appalling weather conditions last weekend over most of the country
didn't help but, on the evidence of that opening league Saturday, there
remains much room for improvement if spectators are not to feel
short-changed.
Today in the first division of the Tennents SRU Premiership the four
unbeaten sides -- Watsonians, Edinburgh Academicals, Melrose, and Hawick
-- each face losers from last weekend and, even this early in the
season, there exists the tantalising possibility of a gap developing
between championship contenders and those who will have more of an eye
on the slippery slope to relegation.
For Stirling County, in particular, having stumbled at the first
hurdle in their championship defence against Hawick -- and even more
extraordinarly having done so on home turf at Bridgehaugh -- an away win
today against last season's runners-up Watsonians is an absolute
necessity.
On Wednesday night, in Scottish rugby's first full-scale programme of
after-hours league action, County entertain championship contenders
Edinburgh Academicals at Bridgehaugh. County coach Brian Edwards has
admitted that he considered the home league opener against Hawick to be
a ''banker.'' Watsonians today and Accies in four days' time certainly
do not come into that category. Edwards and captain Kevin McKenzie know
better than most that an immediate upturn in fortunes is vital.
McKenzie said: ''If I knew what had gone wrong last week then it
wouldn't have happened. We were just rusty. I'd only played two
40-minute sessions beforehand and some of the players had even less than
that.
''But that's not an excuse. We knew that it was going to be tough.
We've got a couple of hard games ahead, but with only eight teams in the
division there aren't going to be any easy ones.
''We lost only once last year and every home game was a celebration.
It was easy for the supporters, too. Now is the time when we need all
the real fans to rally around. It's much easier to support a side when
they are on the crest of the wave, but the real fans get behind you
through thick and thin. Confidence has been dented, but if we can get a
win today then we'll be back in there with a real boost.''
At Mansfield Park, Hawick, minus the injured Greig Oliver, will seek
to build upon that bonus win over Stirling when Heriot's FP are the
visitors. The Goldenacre men are still short of half-a-dozen candidates
for the top side and today they will debut 23-year-old Auckland
development squad fly-half Terry Rahui.
Hawick captain Brian Renwick declared: ''I wouldn't want to be talking
about a return to the glory days at Mansfield, but there's no doubt that
some of our younger boys are coming out of their shells and we will give
every side a game.
''I worry, though, about the eight-team divisions. For many clubs it's
going to be win-at-all-costs to avoid relegation, and I know that if I
was paying the #6 admission charge then I'd want to see some rugby
played. If rugby wants to be a high-profile sport then you have to
entertain, because the spectators won't put up with nine and 10-man
rugby forever.''
Boroughmuir make the trip to the Greenyards, where they will try to
show against Melrose that they are a better side than was indicated by
the 18-3 beating inflicted by Edinburgh Accies last weekend. Melrose
coach Rob Moffat, for one, does not believe that last weekend's defeat
was a true indicator of Meggetland worth. He will recall, too, that when
they last met Boroughmuir were blowing particularly hot and that,
effectively, the Melrose title challenge was ended by a 53-29 defeat.
Edinburgh Academicals have Gala at Raeburn Place. The Accies are, in
many ways, championship dark horses. Unlike many of their rivals they
have not delved deep into the antipodean well for new talent this
season, but are happy to soldier on with the home-grown product. The
very least that one would expect from this fixture is an arithmetical
improvement on the outcome of last season's encounter when, after 80
stultifying minutes, neither side had troubled the scorer.
In the second division, GHK travel to Malleny Park to take on
championship leaders Currie, while West, with a much changed side, are
at home to Jed-Forest.
* FORMER Scotland skipper and record points scorer Gavin Hastings has
still to respond to a tentative inquiry from the Murrayfield-based
Scottish Claymores American football side that he try out as
goal-kicker. As reported some time ago, the Claymores said yesterday
that the ball was still in the Hastings court.

'As players play for money, maybe the lovely things about rugby union
will be set aside. I'm thinking of things like loyalty to your club,
something which here in the Borders has been so tremendously strong for
over 100 years'
* BILL McLAREN'S playing career was cut short by TB in 1948 when he
was just 24 years old, but within three years he had made his first
broadcast for the BBC and was en route to becoming the Voice of Rugby.
He has, too, been a Herald columnist for over three decades. Today, as
he lays down the columnar pen to concentrate on match analysis and
broadcasting, McLaren provides, in conversation with DEREK DOUGLAS, a
forthright and candid appraisal of the game he has graced for more than
half a century.
DOUGLAS: The world of rugby is changing faster now than at any time in
its history. The amateur era is almost at an end. You are, I think, not
in favour of the new professionalism?
McLAREN: It is sad for the sport. To some extent the game has been
betrayed. I know that the Northern Hemisphere officials have been in a
way dragged along by the Southern Hemisphere, but it saddens me to think
that, as players play for money, maybe the lovely things about rugby
union will be set aside.
I'm thinking of things like loyalty to your club, something which here
in the Borders has been so tremendously strong for over 100 years.
Loyalty to the schools up in the cities as well. The game will be
diminished when that loyalty goes.
Also, it concerns me -- having just looked at the video of the South
Africa versus Wales game last weekend -- that if that is the kind of
thuggery that the game is coming to then it makes you a wee bit
concerned about the extra pressure, certainly on international players,
week in and week out.
Professionalism will also mean extra pressure on national selectors.
If they don't select a player, or if they drop a player, then it could
mean quite a lot to him financially. There are all those ramifications
which have not been thought through.
Where do the payments stop? Do they go to referees? What about club
secretaries? What about groundsmen who clean up the stands and cut the
grass and all of that. Where will they stand in a professional game?
Again, regarding that Springbok game, I was delighted to see the
citing law brought into operation. The referee can't see everything and
the culprit will think he's got away with it, but the evidence is there
on television for all to see.
DD: But there are those who feel that citing from TV replays
undermines the referee's role as sole judge of fact on the day.
McLaren: The trouble is that there are so many cheats in the game
these days that referees can't cope with what is going on. The referee
deserves to be paid far more than the players do, because his job is so
demanding physically and mentally. The pressure on referees these days
is appalling.
DD: But it's an oft-heard cry that the game isn't nearly so dirty as
it used to be.
McLaren: I don't hold with that view. Certainly, there is far more
cheating going on than there used to be. There is far more deliberate
intent to beat the referee than I remember seeing even 15 or 20 years
ago.
Some of the dissent shown by players, and especially captains, these
days on the international field disfigures the game. Sometimes you will
see a guy asking what the decision is and then walking away shaking his
head. All he is doing is telling 50,000 people that the referee is a
clot and that he's got it wrong, and more often than not it's just not
true.
DD: You give the impression that you are quite disillusioned by recent
developments in the game.
McLaren: Well, there have been a lot of changes since what we might
term the good old days, but I don't want to give the impression that I'm
utterly disillusioned, because I'm not.
When you see games like the '84 and '88 Barbarians matches against the
Australians, the Grand Slam side in '84 and the '88 side which still had
the star components in it. When you see two matches like that with 21
tries scored and yet the defences were really committed and each side
was desperately keen to win, when you see games like that then you have
to say that the game is as magnificent as it has ever been. But these
situations are becoming few and far between.
DD: That saddens you?
McLaren: I went to the World Cup in South Africa thinking that it
would be a sizzling tournament. When I looked at the list of full backs,
starting with Andre Joubert and Mike Catt, Sadourny and Gavin Hastings
-- a galaxy of tremendous, running full backs -- I thought we would see
some great play, because those guys would add that touch of adventure
which is so essential to the game.
Gavin scored those great tries against the Ivory Coast but, generally,
the full backs all cut back a bit. With full backs of that quality I was
very disappointed that there wasn't the adventurous running out of the
deep that I had been hoping for.
DD: What do you attribute that to?
McLaren: Oh, just fear of making a mistake. Old Terry McLean, the
doyen of New Zealand rugby writers, away back in 1964 outside the Crown
Hotel in Hawick when he was across with the All Blacks, said to me that
the trouble with 'bloody rugby union was bloody fear.' The players, he
said, were frightened of making a 'bloody mistake.' That was away back
in 1964 and that fear has accentuated over the years. Players are now
frightened of making the fatal mistake.
DD: Which players over the years have given you the most pleasure?
McLaren: Fellows like David Campese, and Andy Irvine before him. Keith
Robertson of Melrose and, in his best days, Gavin Hastings. These guys
could light up a game. When Andy Irvine played, whenever he got the
ball, the crowd just sat up. You never knew what he was going to do.
DD: These players didn't fear failure. But it didn't always come off,
did it?
McLaren: No, they didn't have that fear of making the fatal error and,
true enough, it didn't always work out, but they were adventurers who
weren't frightened of tilting the lance.
DD: Has coaching played a role in curbing that sense of adventurism?
McLaren: I was writing for The Herald when Bill Dickinson took over as
coach, or advisor to the Scottish captain as it was termed then. At the
time I admired Bill tremendously and I still do have admiration for him
because of the way that he brought organisation to the Scottish side.
Bill raised Scotland's reputation tremendously. He was such a student
of scrummaging, of how to ease pressure and put on pressure, that he
made the Scottish scrummage a frightening thing. At that time the
Scottish scrummage could destroy people. But I do worry a bit about
coaching because we have become terribly stereotyped and predictable.
DD: Players are, though, fitter now than they have ever been.
McLaren: Undoubtedly. Nowadays, fellows are so tremendously fit and
physically hard that it makes the mind boggle. We have just seen two
sevens tournaments in the Borders at the beginning of the season and the
finalists were running like spring lambs. That speaks volumes for the
fact that players are fitter and harder than ever before. I just wish
there was some way in which the legislators could encourage a little
more use of flair.
Maybe it would mean players standing 10 metres back from the
scrummage, just as at the lineout. Something has got to be done about
putting the offside law into full practice because the flair players are
being played out of the game.
DD: What's the best Scotland side you've seen?
McLaren: The best Scotland pack was the one which Dickinson
manufactured. McLauchlan at loose-head prop, Laidlaw, Dunlop or Madsen
at hooker, Carmichael at tight-head, McHarg and Gordon Brown at lock,
usually Peter Brown, Nairn McEwan or Roger Arniel in the back-row. That
pack of the seventies was magnificent and caused even the likes of
England to bite their finger nails at the thought of taking them on.
McHarg was not only a good lineout man and a good scrummager but a
tremendous full back or winger as well. Ian McLauchlan was a quite
extraordinary scrummager and hurt a lot of people. Sandy Carmichael was
one of the best tight-head props imaginable and one of the great
tackling props.
My back division would have to be Roy Laidlaw and John Rutherford, the
ham and eggs at half-back. Keith Robertson would be in it and Andy
Irvine would be there, too. And David Johnston. I'll never forget his
try against Wales in 1982 when Scotland thrashed them.
It was from a straightforward scrummage. He was like a blink of light.
He went outside his man, left the winger standing and was in without a
hand laid on him. It was the most amazing piece of acceleration that I
have ever seen from a Scotland threequarter.
That was a magnificent victory by a truly tremendous side.

Liz Taylor vouches that if you remember Barbara Hulanicki, you'll be
overcome with nostalgia at the latest Christie's sale
FOR an unregenerate clothesaholic with fairly flamboyant taste, it is
a great relief to learn that all the money expended over the years was
not prodigally frittered after all.
Christie's in London have given their seal of approval to the sort of
clothes that I lusted after and bedecked myself with from the 1950s 'til
the 1980s.
Sequins and bugle beads, tassels and tartans, ankle-breaking platform
shoes, rhinestones, lace, vinyl and wet-look plastic are all featured in
a sale entitled ''Street Fashion'' which the auction house is presenting
in their Old Brompton Street premises on September 12. It is sure to
have ex-swingers digging into the backs of the wardrobes because
Christie's plan to make this sale an annual event.
Up until the 1950s high fashion was synonymous with ''expensive'',
''tasteful'', and usually French, but the huge explosion of pop music
and young people with money in the late fifties and sixties changed
that. Fashion took to the street and started experimenting with all
sorts of manmade materials that more traditional designers would never
have allowed into their ateliers.
One of the designers whose work is featured is Paco Rabanne who
designed in plastic and metal. Several of his chain mail handbags are in
the sale with estimates of around #300 and there is also a 1970s chain
mail mini dress made of blue, silver and gilt butterfly links -- not the
most comfortable dress in the world -- which is being sold with a chain
mail handbag and Christie's expect the lot to go for between #150 and
#200.
Other famous names of the fashion scene in the seventies were Vivienne
Westwood and Malcolm McLaren who opened boutiques with names like ''Let
It Rock''; ''Too Fast to Live Too Young to Die''; ''Sex'' and
''Seditionaries'' at various times during the decade. Their designs were
always avant garde and among examples in the sale are T-shirts printed
with slogans like ''She's Dead I'm Alive I'm Yours'' or with pictures
showing bare breasts. Four T-shirts, one of them printed with bare
breasts, are on offer at around #250.
Other McLaren/Westwood offerings are their famous bondage trousers --
one pair in pink cotton with a towelling bum flap, and another tartan
pair with a black towelling bum flap estimated at between #500 and #600.
The designer Barbara Hulanicki of Biba was never as outrageous as
Westwood and McLaren but nevertheless equally typical of her times. She
is represented in the sale by a pair of salopettes in dark blue cotton,
a pair of lime green platform sandals and a pair of black suede platform
court shoes, as well as a skirt and short sleeved jacket made in Biba's
characteristic crushed velvet (estimate #120-#180), and a maxi coat of
orange plush with a deep stand collar (about #140).
The most outrageous shoes in the sale however are not Hulanicki's but
purple and white plastic boots on 15-inch platform soles which were worn
with a matching purple helmet by the performing artist Leigh Bowery who
died recently. Christie's estimate for the boots and the helmet is
between #200 and #400.
Other famous designers with works in the sale include Bill Blass, Bill
Gibb, Emilio Pucci, Yves St Laurent, Gina Fratini, Pierre Cardin, Zandra
Rhodes and Thea Porter whose evening dress of chestnut brown velvet
embroidered with butterflies carries an estimate of around #100.
There is also a large selection of clothes designed by Jean Muir, many
of which belonged to the late Miss Jean Scroggie, one time woman's
editor of the Daily Telegraph and associate editor of Homes and Gardens,
who was a friend of Jean Muir and obviously one of her best customers.
The Jean Scroggie clothes are all size 10 and include a dress of
raspberry pink suede with long tapered sleeves and shaped buttons (about
#200); a grey satin robe with applique satin trim; a tunic of midnight
blue leather; a jacket of ochre suede and a coat made of salmon pink,
russet and plum coloured leathers which is estimated at between #300 and
#500 and is one of the most expensive lots on offer. Highest price of
around #900 is expected for a Pierre Cardin sequinned evening gown in
psychedelic colours.
As well as clothes, costume jewellery is being offered and includes
Miriam Haskill necklaces, Trifari brooches, a Boucher clip brooch, a
Schiaparelli brooch in the form of a frog with a blue cabuchon body,
Chanel ear rings and a necklace of simulated pearls interspersed with
imitation emeralds and rubies that once belonged to Coco Chanel. It is
estimated at around #600.
The sale does not concern itself exclusively with women's clothes
because the first lot to be offered is a 1950s Teddy boy suit of blue
wool with black velvet lapels. It carries the label of a Savile Row
tailor, and, with some other clothes, is expected to fetch around #200.

* DID you know that at one time many Scottish estates had their own
tweed patterns which were used to make clothes for the estate owner and
his retainers?
In a way these estate tweeds are distantly related to clan tartans
which were prohibited after the '45 but estate owners still wanted some
distinctive costume and the first individual tweed was designed at
Glenfeshie by Miss Balfour of Balbirnie in the 1840s.
These classic tweeds were often made by the famous weavers, Johnstons
of Elgin, whose former chairman, Ned Harrison, has just produced an
interesting book entitled Scottish Estate Tweeds, listing, illustrating
and tracing the history of the materials and their distinctive designs.
The book, published by Johnstons of Elgin, costs #16.95 and can be
bought or ordered at most bookshops.

ON the eve of today's grand prix final in Monaco, the International
Amateur Athletic Federation have announced that next season a further
$1m will be available to the circuit.
An athlete breaking the 100 metres world record could earn $350,000
for less than 10 seconds' work.
The overall men's and women's jackpot will double to $200,000, while
winners of individual events will receive $50,000. In addition there
will be a $100,000 bonus for anyone who sets a world record.
Overall champions in today's Monte Carlo final will receive $100,000,
plus $30,000 for winning their event. There is no bonus for a world
record, and the future of the event is in doubt, with Mobil, sponsors
for 10 years, about to step down as official backers.
There are 17 world champions (11 men, six women) on today's $2m budget
programme, but unless one of his rivals sets a world record,
steeplechaser Moses Kiptanui need finish only third in his speciality to
win the men's overall title, ensuring a total of $30,000.
In the women's overall grand prix, Mozambique's Maria Mutola has a
six-point lead over her closest rival, thanks to her world 1000m record
in Brussels last month.
A win today would be compensation for her disqualification in the
semi-finals of the Gothenburg world championship 800m.
A sciatic injury has blocked the progress of Motherwell's Yvonne
Murray, and she has failed to contest enough races to qualify for
today's final.
It will be a matter of concern to Scottish officials that no other
domestic athlete features in the programme. Murray, however, is looking
forward to her half-marathon debut against Liz McColgan in the BUPA
Great North Run a week tomorrow.
* INVERCLYDE District Council have a festival of road-running
tomorrow, starting at 10am on the town's Esplanade -- a marathon,
half-marathon, and 10,000m. There is also a fun run in the Battery Park,
and street miles for women and women. Entries will be accepted on the
day.
* IT is a paradox that two Scots who were not invited to Monaco could
help land Scotland a world hill-running championship medal tomorrow. Tom
Murray (Spango Valley), once on life support as a four-stone anorectic,
and Robert Quinn (Kilbarchan) who almost lost a leg in a motor bike
accident, head a host team which could upset the odds in Edinburgh.

* A GLASWEGIAN has been chosen from more than 900 applicants to
exhibit her textiles in London next October at the seventeenth Chelsea
Crafts Fair, the finest event for selling contemporary crafts in Europe.
Sara Keith, 26, has been teaching and working in textiles since
graduating from Glasgow School of Art in 1990. She uses only natural
dyes, specialises in scarves, and uses an ancient Japanese dye technique
called Shibori.
The Chelsea Crafts fair is held at Chelsea Old Town Hall in London's
Kings Road between October 10-15 and 17-22. There will be a total of 225
makers showing work from ceramics and glass to fine jewellery and
furniture.
For more information regarding Sara Keith's work call her on 0141 353
0937.
* LEISUREWEAR has not awarded the world with its best fashion
accessories. The shell-suit, jogging pants and trainer are excuses for
citizens to slum it.
Comfort is never stylish. Mondi don't make suits with elasticated
waists. With this in mind a new company have designed another range of
trainer, because they don't believe previous selections have been casual
or comfortable enough.
Kangaroos International Ltd have gym shoes and rubbers in satin,
metallic blue, red, mango and acid green, in women's and kid's sizes. If
they sound a tad adventurous for a trip to Tesco, the retro joggers come
in a more normal style but in candy floss pinks and turquoise blues.
Call Shona Carmichael on 0181-346-2600 for a catalogue.

Anvar Khan takes some sensible advice from one of the oldest cosmetics
firms in the business
I HAVE water retention on my cheekbone. I had previously and rigidly
related this condition only to my stomach and a certain time of the
month. However, it seems that pockets of superfluous fluid are all over
the body, including the face. But Pat McPherson, peripatetic make-up and
beauty specialist for Guerlain, reassured me that with a little massage,
and a regular smidgeon of either Issima Eye Serum or Sublilift A R T
Recontouring Serum, the area would cease to be congested.
Pat has worked for Guerlain for 16 years and is full of dazzling
information. I met her at my local karaoke. She's a mean performer. Her
rendition of George Michael's Faith has more sass than the original. She
knows how to have a good time. If anyone can sell Guerlain products, she
can. ''We're not pushy. Most of our customers are loyal. We take a pride
in what we do because we know it's not a con.''
Guerlain are an old company, established in 1828. A man called Pierre
Francois Pascal Guerlain, the son of a candlemaker, had been sent to
study at university in England. He graduated as a doctor and a chemist,
but instead of going into medicine he chose beauty.
''At that time,'' chatted Pat, ''if women wanted to look beautiful
they took their life in their hands.'' Guerlain was the first man to
make beauty hygenic and scientific. He took the risk out skin care. The
Guerlain salon is the oldest shop in the Champs-Elysees. And still, the
family company do not advertise excessively. They take 25 times more
money in that salon in Paris than in the whole of the UK.
Meanwhile, back in the de-industrialised heartland they call Glasgow,
I leaned backwards to rest my head on Pat's chest, at the Guerlain
counter in Debenhams, as she applied two cotton-wool pads soaked in
cleanser to my weary lids. She smoothed, massaged, and toned until I
felt completely relaxed.
Guerlain have various products for every part of the face. Their
eyecream has been recommended by plastic surgeons at Canniesburn
Hospital because of its strengthening properties. Their newest vital
ingredient inhibits a natural enzyme called ''elastase'' from eating up
the reserves of elastin in the skin. Guerlain looked to Nasa, by using
the same principle as spacesuits in their fight to retain moisture in
the body. Guerlain take their time.
My makeover took two-and-a-half hours. The creation of flagship
perfume Samsara took seven years. And there is still, in the dark
recesses of the Guerlain factory, a man whose sole job consists of
rolling rocks of bath salts by hand, backwards and forwards until they
are silky smooth. This is a family who demand time and labour for
quality results.
''We sell a lip balm called Baulme de la Ferte, and we don't how old
it is,'' explains Pat. ''In those days when they made a product, nobody
recorded it. It dates back to 1890, but it could be older. It was
originally made for a feeding mother's nipples. We think Pierre Guerlain
was commissioned by the woman's husband. In those days the only reason a
product would be made was by commission.''
I emerged from my Guerlain session at Debenhams revamped and
re-invented. I am now aware of what I should not be doing to my skin.
Scrubbing with polishing pads or exfoliating until dry with ground peach
kernels is bad, because if you rob the skin of its water you rob it of
its protection. Always massage towards the heart, because an alternative
route may produce red broken veins. And lick you lips to keep lipstick
soft, shiny, and durable.
''But be careful who you're doing it in front of,'' warned Pat,
obviously au fait with the numerous facial expressions men can decipher
as a come-on, ''because it looks very sensous''.
* For a Guerlain makeover ask for Guerlain Account Manager Dorothy
Moore at Frasers, or Account Manager Carol McLaughlin at Debenhams.
There is usually a #5 fee. Rooms are available in the beauty rooms of
either store which are more private. The products used in this article
included Guerlain Evolution Cleanser #22, Guerlain Evolution Toner #22,
Lipstick #11.50, Guerlain Liquid Liner in teal green, brown, black,
mauve and grey #14.50.
* The Herald is offering readers the opportunity of a makeover,

salons. Stylefile invites you to say, in no more than 25 words, why you
feel you deserve a makeover. The five readers with the best answers will

With less than 60 miles to go to the finish of the first Teacher's
Round Britain Challenge at Southend Pier yesterday, Scotland's two
entries were facing an uphill task to overcome the 2200-mile, four-stage
race's overall leaders, Wales.
Richard Tudor, on Pride of Cardiff, was dicing with Ireland's David
Harte on Dream of Erin for line honours. The leading pair had a 12-mile
cushion over Tudor's compatriot Colin Lyons, on Celtic Dragon.
The two Scottish boats, Lord Inverforth (Paul Jeffes) and Glendronach
(Jon Fitzgerald), lay fourth and fifth within a mile of Celtic Dragon.
Scotland's only hope of salvaging a race victory outright was for
Jeffes to slow the third-placed Welsh boat using match race spoiling
tactics to allow Glendronach to catch them up, then hope that they could
then conspire to put one or more boats between them and Celtic Dragon by
the finish line.
1, Ireland II (D Harte) 56 miles to finish; 2, Wales I (R Tudor) 56;
3, Wales II (C Lyons) 68; 4, Scotland I (P Jeffes) 68; 5, Scotland II (J
Fitzgerald) 69; 6, France III (J-P Saliou) 72; 7, England II (D
Alan-Williams) 73; 8, England I (V Cherry) 78; 9, Ireland I (D Gomes)
84; 10 France I (D Nicholas) 98.

* THE new range from high street store, Oasis, is, frankly, murder.
Funereal grey tweed is making a comeback. The Oasis new winter coat too,
is hairy ''Miss Marple'' check (#94.99). Supersleuth Granny fashion is
in. But older women can afford to be intelligent under the guise of
eccentricity. Oasis, and the other stores who promulgate the style and
shapes of catwalk designers, are firing into an ageist train of thought.
The dated look is in. This season, you either have to look very old or
very young, as Oasis autumn/winter collection also includes retro
sixties' garb -- mini-skirted suits which would follow a body's mature
curves if mature curvy women were allowed to fit into them. As it is,
Miss Marple isn't too bad a fashion inspiration, dreadfully English,
except that cerebral wizards don't usually care how they dress. And in
this way it seems, Oasis have a grunge hangover, and a range of clothes
simply for elegant slumming.

Conrad Wilson goes in search of Eastern promise and is not
disappointed too often
IT would be misleading to claim that Scotland's Thai and Malaysian
restaurants have become a threat to their Chinese and Indian
counterparts. But they are definitely an alternative, and a popular one,
if their development not only in Edinburgh and Glasgow, but even in
conservative Perth, North Berwick, and Musselburgh, means what it seems.
The attraction of these Far Eastern cuisines is easy to explain. The
use of lemongrass, tamarind, coconut, and citrus leaves, the sharp,
clean flavours, the emphasis on presentation and colour, the avoidance
of the sogginess that is one of the more depressing features of
Cantonese cooking, have given them their own special appeal. It is food
that looks as good as it tastes. The conspicuous absence of MSG is
another plus point.
But Thai restaurants need to educate their public, perhaps taking
their cue from Kris, Scotland's leading Malaysian restaurant, whose
eponymous proprietor, in the politest and least patronising way, will
steer you course by course through the niceties of a Malaysian meal.
Originally based in what has since become a pizzeria, he recently
re-established himself in suaver premises below the Albany Hotel in
Edinburgh, where tables are more widely spaced, chairs more comfortable,
and the atmosphere more inviting, yet the food is no more expensive and
no less good.
Though the idea of installing a Far Eastern restaurant within the
classical surroundings of a New Town hotel may seem curious, Kris simply
forms part of a trend established some years ago by Buntom's, whose
decor glitters audaciously on the ground floor of an otherwise trad
hotel in Nelson Street, round the corner from the Robert Louis Stevenson
House.
The philosophy is presumably that such restaurants will bring their
own exotic glamour to what might otherwise be a grey and ordinary
building, or else that the hotel's customers will bring a degree of
security to what could be a financially precarious restaurant.
Though Thai and Malaysian restaurants have far more in common with
each other than with Indian or Chinese establishments, and though they
have a shared enthusiasm for chicken and fresh seafood, there are subtle
differences in detail. Kris, for instance, places much emphasis on beef,
one of his specialities being Daging Rendang, in which the meat is
blended with fresh coconut, red chillies, lemongrass, and dry roasted
herbs. His Malaysian hors d'oeuvres including curry puffs, bean curd
with peanut sauce, and something that tastes eerily like haggis, also
differentiate him from the Thai repertoire.
So, for that matter, do his high-profile contrasts of colour. But
though Siam Erawan, in its intimate cellar premises at the bottom of
Howe Street, is more subdued in this respect, its flavours are no less
striking and its range of vegetarian dishes are a special feature. All
these places, it seems to me, are real assets to Scotland, though the
recently-opened River Kway -- an unfortunate name, perhaps, in view of a
certain current anniversary -- has yet to fulfil its potential.
Judged purely on the merits of its spicy crab, stir-fried with egg,
curry, celery, and spring onions, it could be hailed as rather good --
an impressive advert indeed for a head chef with the fine Thai name of
Darren McLaughlin. Judged in other ways, however, it fares less well.
Among the starters, the crispy chicken balls on one recent visit proved
cold and clammy. The decor was makeshift. The wine list (at least in
comparison with Kris's) seemed impoverished. Yet dinner for two was
startlingly dear. Better, then to stick to the lunchtime noodles --
''healthy food for less than the price of junk food'' -- yours for
#2.75.
* Kris Malaysian Restaurant, 39a Albany Street, Edinburgh (Tel 0131
556 6748). Average price of a two-course meal with rice for two people
with an inexpensive bottle of wine, #40.

IT IS a strange phenomenon that a city's diners and drinkers are
tastes apart. Glasgow proudly pronounces itself to be the curry capital
of Britain because its citizens put flavour in the diet and have empathy
with the delectable tastes of Indian food. Curiously its drinkers fall
largely into the category whose preference is for dead, kegged beers
that are gassed back to life and which offer as much taste as a 10-times
used teabag.
The Edinburgh public has been long used to a wide range of beers and
consequently the typical Edinburgh pub will have a line of pumps
dispensing cask ales. Brewers such as Russell Sharpe at Caledonian and
Duncan Kellock at Maclays have produced portfolios of beers that are
hugely successful with a city's public that enjoys flavour from its
beers.
In Glasgow and the west, beer drinkers do not have the same variety.
And apart from notable exceptions, publicans take in brewers' kegs of
dead beer. However, it is not entirely our publicans' fault if he does
not stock real ale. The cellars in many of the city's pubs, especially
those in tenement bars, do not have the space to dedicate an area to
cask beer which requires a different storage temperature and technical
problems can be immense.
To lift the depression there's nothing better than a festival. And
just as those who crave the many flavours of curries then the beer
drinker whose taste has not been anaesthetised by all that gas can try a
fair selection of beers, thanks to the industry of the Glasgow and West
of Scotland branch of CAMRA.
In this the year that the branch comes of age it promises to be the
best yet. More than 170 British beers are under the expert care of Gavin
Harvie of the State Bar and a vast range of bottled beers from Belgium,
Germany and the New World will be available. To sample all 170 beers in
the three days of the festival in half-pint measures would demand a
consumption of 30 pints each day. Better to o study the programme and
follow your nose.
Helpful staff will guide you through the list as will those around you
whose knowledge about beer is likely to be advanced. And you will not be
confronted with swilling and swaying wall-to-wall Mr Blobbys.
Ken Brooker at Harviestoun has brewed a special beer called
Twenty-first Birthday Ale to help the branch celebrate and from
Scotland's newest brewery Leann an Eilean on Uig, Skye, it is hoped to
have Red Cuillin if it is available. Other Scottish brewers will be
present in great strength to combat the challenge from south of the
Border.
Although every beer will not be on tap all of the time there will be
sufficient to sample with at least 100 being on regular call. Scotland
is well represented and a range of beers from the recently taken over
Broughton Brewery will be on the same side as four times best beer in
Scotland winner, Deuchars IPA. Other Scots in the line up are Glasgow's
Glaschu brewery, still under threat of closure, with three products; and
the Fife Brewing Company has brought along Auld Alliance; Traquair
promises a treat, supplying its House Ale in cask, normally only
available in the bottle; and Tomintoul, the wee brewery from Banffshire,
doing good work, is also represented.
From south of the Border are some rare guests. From Nethergate you can
make Umble Ale your last or stay with it all night. The beer has been
filtered through coriander seeds and it has a curry flavour which to
many is like drinking food. It may reduce the craving for that heavenly
food that often comes after a beer drinking session.
* The Glasgow Ale Festival takes place at The Arches, Midland Street,
Glasgow between Thursday, September 21 until Saturday, September 23.
Opening between 3.00pm and 11.30pm on Thursday and 11.00am until 11.30pm
Friday and Saturday. Admission #2.50 includes souvenir pint glass.

Broadcaster and former trade unionist Jimmy Reid (left) lives in
Glasgow with his wife and three daughters.
* I DON'T have a typical day. There would be less tension in my life
if it was more ordered but order is for the orderly and I'm from Govan.
Sometimes I get up at 4.30am to take a coffee and write. These can be
gloriously fruitful hours. Just after seven when the household stirs,
Joan brings me some toast and tea and maybe, if I'm in her good books, a
poached egg. When I do work through the night and surface it's for a
sort of brunch. Fruit, cheese, that sort of thing. When I rise with the
family I can have a choice and like porridge with fruit. I'm not into
health food, I just like fruit.
Lunch is always light except if I go out which is seldom. With good
friends it becomes a marathon session. Favourite food is mussels cooked
in a pot with a sprinkling of white wine, nothing else. I think modern
cooking tends to be over-sauced. I love lobster but it's so expensive.
Totties and mince and mashed turnips take a bit of beating, as does
home-made steak pie.
Favourite drink is malt whisky. People who add lemonade or other
beverage to a malt should be shot.
At its best Chinese cooking is superb. At times I only want to eat
Chinese and go to a restaurant in Giffnock, or two in Glasgow. I also
like good Italian places, which abound in Glasgow.

* I have a full-time job but also have self-employed earnings as a
musician. I pay tax separately on these but so far have done nothing
about paying separate national insurance contributions. Can you tell me
how much this is going to cost and how the payments are made?
* Self-employed earners are liable to pay Class 2 and 4 national
insurance contributions and the amount is dependant on the level of the
self-employed income. There is an exemption from Class 2 if your
earnings are less than #3260 for the current tax year and Class 4 also
does not apply at this level. If your income exceeds this the rate of
Class 2 contribution is #5.75 a week and you should contact the DSS
about payment. This is normally done by monthly standing order.
Class 4 contributions are charged in your income tax assessment and
are a percentage of profits between #6640 and #22,880. The current rate
is 7.3% up to a maximum contribution of #1185.
There is, however, a further point to mention. As you will be paying
Class 1 contributions on your income from employment, there is a maximum
level of all contributions which may apply. This is #2086.09 for the
year 1995/96 and if your payments under Class 1, 2 and 4 exceed this you
will be entitled to a refund. Alternatively, if you expect your overall
contributions to exceed this you may apply to the DSS to defer payment
of the Class 2 and 4 contributions until your liability is finalised.

ARE you a prisoner in your own building society? Millions are, thanks
to the growing number of takeovers and mergers among giant societies.
While the prospect of cash bonuses and free shares is undoubtedly
attractive, it is very difficult to know exactly what you can and can't
do with your savings and borrowings while the takeover talks drag on.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester customers were set free at the end of July
after a sentence of more than two-and-half years as details of the
takeover by Lloyds Bank were thrashed out. To qualify for their share of
the #1800m paid by Lloyds for C&amp;G, eligible investors had to keep their
accounts open from the end of December 1992 to July 31 this year.
Various dates were announced in the meantime to determine how much of a
windfall each was to receive.
Now more than a million N&amp;P savers are in the same boat. Anyone who
opened a qualifying investment account before the end of April should
receive free shares or cash when the society is taken over by Abbey
National. But that's not due to be completed until next summer and N&amp;P
has still to announce exact details of how savers and borrowers will
benefit. This makes it difficult for customers to know whether, in
response to cuts in the rates paid on several N&amp;P savings accounts, they
can move some of their money elsewhere without jeopardising their
entitlement.
N&amp;P has not yet set a qualifying date to decide which savers will be
eligible for an extra variable distribution of shares and the option of
taking cash rather than Abbey National shares, for example. ''We
appreciate that customers are unsure about what they can do with their
accounts and we are trying to get more information out as quickly as
possible,'' says N&amp;P. ''But takeovers like this are extremely
complicated and we have to get the details right.''
Savers with the Halifax, which now includes the former Leeds Permanent
building society, got a clearer idea this week of how they can maximise
their payout when the Halifax turns itself into a bank. A basic
distribution of free shares, expected to be worth between #600 and #800,
will be paid to customers who on November 25 last year had an eligible
savings account containing at least #100 or at least #100 outstanding on
their mortgage -- so long as the account remains open until the society
finally converts into a bank, probably early in 1997. This means savers
can use their accounts normally in the meantime and, so long as they
always leave a #100 balance, will qualify for the basic share
distribution.
There are also plans for a variable distribution of shares, based on
the amount savers have in their investment accounts. The percentage has
not yet been announced -- it was just over 13% for C&amp;G savers -- but
will be based on savings of between #1000 and #50,000.
The actual payout depends on your total savings in qualifying Halifax
(and/or old Leeds Permanent) accounts on November 25, 1994, or the date
of the special general meeting (SGM). This is expected to be in December
1996 when members will vote on the conversion plans. Qualifying accounts
include Tessas and Sharesaves as well as share accounts such as Premium
Xtra and Solid Gold.
So if you take money out of any of these be sure to top it up to the
November 1994 level before the SGM. The Halifax says all qualifying
members will receive written notification of the date of the meeting
several weeks beforehand, but it makes sense to plan well in advance if
you will need to transfer money from other notice accounts to rebuild
your Halifax balance.
Children and those with less than #100 in their accounts when the
society converts will receive a cash bonus, likely to be around 5% to
10%, rather than shares.
Although Halifax savers now know they can safely use their savings
accounts while the conversion plans trundle on, borrowers should be very
careful. Any existing Halifax borrower who wants to take advantage of
one of the attractive discount mortgage rates available to remortgage
their home needs to do their sums very carefully. Some discount schemes
can cut your borrowing costs to under 3% with the discount fixed for the
next 12 months. That compares with a typical standard mortgage rate of
nearly 8% despite recent cuts. But Halifax borrowers who remortgage with
another lender will lose their right to the basic distribution of free
shares.
Halifax borrowers who come to the end of their mortgages before the
conversion date can leave #125 outstanding. Interest is payable on this
-- it amounts to about #8 a year -- but by doing this ex-borrowers
ensure they remain members of the society and benefit from the shares
handout.
For further advice, call the Halifax helpline on 0800 888 844.

* My wife and I are both retired and receive occupational and state
pensions. We purchased our council house and took out a 10-year mortgage
with National &amp; Provincial and an endowment with Scottish Amicable. This
will be paid off in about four years. We also have a lump sum of around
#50,000 with N&amp;P and receive monthly income from this.
In view of the proposed takeover by Abbey National would you advise us
to keep all our savings tied up in the one place or diversify after the
merger?
* It is normally a sensible idea to have a spread of investments but
in your case it does not really matter. Abbey National is financially
very strong and its acquisition of N&amp;P will stengthen its market
position. You can leave your money where it is with confidence, though
you should always check from time to time that you are getting the best
rate available.
* I am a 49-year-old school teacher with 27 years service. I hope to
retire at 55, or earlier if released. An enhancement of service years is
unlikely. I have increased my pension benefits by paying additional
voluntary contributions at 9% through the Prudential Teachers' Scheme.
In March of this year the fund stood at #7500. Pension benefits are
important as I do not have savings. Is it wise to continue to pay 9% of
my salary in this way, or could you suggest alternatives?
* For someone contemplating early retirement AVCs are one of the most
attractive investments that can be made. Not only do they enhance
pension entitlement, but the contributions qualify for full tax relief.
However, you say that you have no savings. Before you retire you
should give some thought to building up some savings to add to your
pension lump sum on retirement. You should have a decent sum in a
building society account and once this has been accomplished the next
logical step would be to invest in investment or unit trusts, which can
be done through monthly savings schemes.
If you are stretching your resources to such an extent by paying AVCs
at 9% of your earnings that you cannot contemplate other forms of saving
or investment, you should consider reducing your contributions to enable
you to do so. Despite the tax attractions of AVCs a more broadly based
approach to financial provision for retirement is desirable.
* Since my retirement some 15 years ago my wife and I have taken
several trips to Venezuela, this being the country of her birth. At
present we are planning a holiday there for a four-week stay to include
Christmas and the New Year.
On previous trips we have taken currency in the form of travellers'
cheques (US dollars) and this has presented no problem whatsoever.
However, I am very aware of the fees, charges or commissions involved. I
vaguely remember reading an article some years ago on this subject and
the advantages of using a credit card were mentioned.
The suggestion was that one put the account (in my case Visa) into
credit by roughly the extent of one's likely spending before going away.
When money is required one would take out cash over the bank counter
using the card in the same way as at home. If you could indicate the
disadvantages or otherwise of using this method I would be grateful.
* This could be a good way to obtain foreign currency during your
visit but there are drawbacks. There would be no problem putting your
Visa card substantially in credit but this would register as an unusual
situation in the computer records.
This means that when you came to obtain money over the counter in a
bank the transaction would be referred for authorisation. This should
only cause a small delay but one could imagine it creating a more
significant problem in a distant country. It should also be possible to
use the card in overseas cash dispensers but it would not be wise to
rely on this. More significant problems could arise in using the card in
shops, because the mere fact that authorisation was required might put
some shops off accepting it.
Depending on your card issuer you might also have difficulties should
it be lost or stolen. Obtaining a replacement might be difficult or
impossible. At least if you took, say, American Express travellers'
cheques it would be easier to replace them and they could be split up
and kept in several places, reducing the risk of losing the lot.
The only advantage of the cashed-up card is that it would save you
money. You would only have to pay the commission on cash withdrawals,
usually 1.5%, and you would reap the advantage of wholesale exchange
rates. There would be no interest to pay, whereas normally it is levied
from the date of the cash transaction. On travellers' cheques you might
pay 1.5% on purchase and 2% on encashment.
So it is a good idea but unfortunately not one you can rely on. One
alternative would be to take two credit cards, one cashed-up and one
not, in case there are problems with the former, though you should
perhaps have some travellers' cheques also to be on the safe side.
Another option would be for a trusted friend to pay pre-signed cheques
into the Visa account so that it stays narrowly in debit to minimise
interest charges.
* In 1992 I began paying additional voluntary contributions to enhance
my pension provision. I now discover that I am likely to be made
redundant in 1997, when I will be 46. I am uncertain, of course, as to
whether I will get another job rapidly, and, therefore, wonder if it
would be best to suspend the AVC payments meantime and invest the money
in some other way, such as investment or unit trusts.
It seems to me a waste of time accumulating a pot which I will not be
able to touch. At least with other investments I could get at the money
before retirement age, and this cash might be very useful. Do you agree?
* You have made out an impeccable case for suspending AVC payments
with which we would not dissent. In any event, if you escape redundancy
or land another job you can always make up the missed payments.
We think you would be best to hold on to the cash saved by suspending
payments. You are only two years away from the possible redundancy you
fear. This is hardly sufficient time for investments to show a decent
return, and there is a risk that the markets might be off the boil when
you need to sell.
* I have a balanced portfolio of blue-chip shares and I have a further
#10,000 to invest. It has been suggested that I put this money into
Murray Johnstone's Murray Monthly Income Selector Plan. (This is the
minimum amount it accepts.) Is this wise, or should I be spreading it
between Alliance, Foreign &amp; Colonial, and the like?
* We would be the last ones to discourage anyone from spreading their
investments around. Alliance and Foreign &amp; Colonial are both excellent
investment trusts and, if you want a bit of income, so are Murray Income
and Murray International. It all really depends on the size of your
portfolio and the market value of its individual components. Unless
these are substantial, #10,000 is a lot to allocate to one investment.
You have not, of course, given us any details of your existing
investments, and without these and information about your financial
needs we hesitate to offer any firm advice. However, you might consult a
stockbroker about how best to invest the #10,000 and ask him or her to
check your existing portfolio in case any changes would be wise.
* I enclose an investment report on the Prolific Balanced Growth Fund
which is held by my wife. Since July 1987 she has contributed #960 at
the rate of #10 a month and yet the value of the investment is only
#1044. This seems an extremely poor return. Should she cash this in or
hold on to the investment?
* This fund actually does not have a bad track record, being a top or
second quartile performer in its sector over most time periods up to 10
years. It is designed to be a conservative relatively low risk fund so
will not produce fireworks.
Currently it is invested 53% in UK equities, 8% in North America, 8%
in Continental Europe, 6% in Japan and 10% in fixed interest. However,
it is easy to forget in the light of the current bull market that
equities have performed relatively poorly in recent years.
The disappointing showing of your wife's investment reflects the slow
build-up of the fund after expenses, but with markets moving ahead well
now it should perform better. An investment trust savings plan would be
better value than policies similar to hers, though the minimum monthly
contribution would be higher.
* I would like to make over to my son an endowment policy which is due
to mature in the year 2001. The advice I have had is that this transfer
will not be effective for inheritance tax even though the policy will be
in my son's name when it matures. I would have thought that under these
circumstances there was no question of a gift being made and I would,
therefore, welcome your comments.
* The advice you have been given is partially correct in that there is
a transfer of value for IHT purposes where the benefits of a life policy
are transferred or assigned as a gift or at less than full value. The
value of the gift is the value of the policy or, if greater, the value
of the total premiums paid to date less any previous partial surrenders
received.
However, the assignation of the policy to your son will be a
potentially exempt transfer which under the normal rules will fall out
of account seven years after the date of assignation. It should also be
noted that if you continue to pay the premiums on the policy these are
also gifts for IHT purposes and, to the extent they are not covered by
exemptions, each premium will also be subject to the potentially exempt
transfer rules.

ONE thing the Wales's did not have to worry about when they delivered
Prince William to Eton this week was how they were going to afford his
fees in the years to come. For many parents though the financial strain
can be considerable, especially when they have several offspring to
educate.
These days the outlay does not stop when they leave school either.
More parents are now having to support their children through higher
education too.
The total bill will take a major slice out of most families' income.
School fees are rising at more than the rate of inflation. According to
Rose Bell, director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, this
year's fees are 3% to 4% up on last time. This means Glasgow parents of
secondary school pupils will have to pay up to #4300 this year depending
on which school they attend.
While parents have a choice about whether they want to pay for private
schooling, if their children go on to higher education they may be given
no choice. Grants are only provided when their joint earnings are less
than #32,500. And even if a grant is available, it may be insufficient.
The National Union of Students calculates that the average student needs
around #4500 a year to survive.
Students whose parents are unable to contribute may be compelled to
discontinue their studies. Across the UK, it is estimated that more than
25,000 are forced to drop out of university every year due to
insufficient funds.
Parents contemplating private schooling or higher education for their
children are, therefore, well advised to start saving as early as
possible. Traditionally with-profits endowments were recommended for
this purpose but nowadays more tax-efficient and flexible savings and
investment schemes such as Tessas, PEPs and zero dividend investment
trust shares are suggested.
The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (AUTIF) has just
published a new guide outlining how unit trusts and PEPs can be used to
help pay education costs. There are a wide variety of unit trusts to
choose from, including corporate bond funds, and regular savings can be
made into both unit trusts and PEPs without having to lock yourself in
to paying a fixed sum for a fixed period.
A more formalised PEP Education Plan has also been launched by the
School Fees Insurance Agency, which claims to be Britain's largest
provider of school fees for independent education. It offers a choice of
five investment trusts and a unit trust managed by Henderson TR, Foreign
&amp; Colonial and Mercury. Life insurance is also provided to safeguard
some or all outstanding fees in the event of an investor's death.
Minimum savings start at #50 a month.
Equity investment can boost your savings but naturally involves some
risk. One way of reducing this is to use zero dividend investment trust
shares which produce a fixed capital return that can be obtained
tax-free by most investors within their capital gains tax allowance. The
Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) offers a free Planning
For School Fees leaflet which explains how they work.
The majority of parents still end up trying to meet fees out of
current income. In recognition of the crippling burden this can become,
an increasing number of loan schemes are now available.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools has recently set up a
scheme in conjunction with the Bank of Scotland which effectively
enables you to defer 50% of your annual fee expenditure. Loans of
between #1000 and #15,000 can be drawn down each term to cover fees.
Repayment is usually calculated to last for double the period over which
the fees are provided, but this can be extended up to a maximum of 20
years. The interest charged is 11.75%, 5% above the bank's base rate.
The outstanding balance of the loan can be repaid at any time without
penalty. The loan can also be taken out to fund higher education.
Similar schemes are available from Sun Life and the School Fees
Insurance Agency.
Another alternative is to take advantage of current competition in the
mortgage market and raise extra finance by remortgaging your home.
Louise Chalice, head of Bowring Financial Services' school fees
practice, which has a branch in Glasgow, points out that parents may be
able to arrange a fixed-rate mortgage which enables them to draw down
future terms' fees at the same rate. She says Bowring can advise parents
on the best sort of loan scheme to meet their needs and the most
tax-efficient method of repayment.

IF you have an appetite for investment trust shares there are likely
to be more on the menu this autumn. They should, according to
indications detected by Philip Middleton of broker Smith New Court, be
somewhat more numerous than he had expected in the spring.
In his latest quarterly review of investment trusts he sticks to his
view that ''the sector remains dear''. But with demand looking a bit
healthier than a few months ago he is now adopting ''an especially
fence-sitting stance'' -- being at or only slightly underweight in the
sector. He notes that the wave of trust restructuring many observers had
expected has barely shown signs of happening. And he would still want to
see wider discounts before looking to achieve out performance through
the discount ratings.
Looking back, the survey notes that in performance terms the sector
suffered from the fact that larger UK companies were one of the best
performing asset classes in world investment, although larger US
companies did even better. The trust sector had been betting heavily
against large companies ''and it suffers when this bit goes wrong''.
Since the end of June, however, UK smaller companies have performed well
and the US's larger ones have drifted a little while its smaller ones
have been performing strongly.
Despite his somewhat lukewarm feeling he has found value in two areas
-- North America and Europe. Among his recommendations are American
Trust, Edinburgh, Electra, Investors Capital and the Kleinwort and
Mercury European privatisation trusts.
Within Europe the French market suffered a bit of an upset after the
resignation of the minister of the economy. NatWest Securities, however,
still likes the look of France and believes that trusts investing there
offer good value. With the SBF-120 index standing at 1290 it sees the
prospect of a gain of over 15% in the next 12 months. Looking ahead to
next year it says the French market is on a prospective price earnings
ratio of 12.3 compared with 14 for the UK, 15.2 for the US and 15.6 for
Germany.
There may be, it cautions, some downside to the market in the short
term. But it notes that the recent elections have left a relatively
stable political environment free of the risk of a socialist government.
It contrasts this with the UK ''where international investors may be
frightened off as an election approaches''. And it suggests setbacks may
be a buying opportunity for trusts investing in France which are already
mainly standing at attractive discounts.
Two trusts specialising in France both have discounts of more than 10%
and both, in theory at least, have limited lives. Paribas French
Investment Trust has a discount of getting on for 15% and is due to wind
up in 1999 unless its life is extended by a special vote in that year.
Its main objective is capital growth. Also specialising in France is the
Second Market Investment Trust, another one aiming for long-term growth.
Although its emphasis is on the second market of smaller companies it
has over a quarter of its investments in main market companies. Its
continuation is subject to an annual vote.
Aside from these two, the NatWest analysts have three other
suggestions for those with a fancy for France. All with high French
weightings, 20 to 30% or more, these are Foreign &amp; Colonial Eurotrust,
which is rated at a small premium rather than a discount, Fleming
European Fledgling, with a discount of more than 11%, and Abtrust
European Index which seeks to track the FTSE Eurotrack 100 index and has
a discount of over 9%.
Meanwhile, it is scratch your head time for anyone interested in
warrants. These are not as simple as you might suppose. Which, of
course, will come as no surprise to those of us who have been around
long enough to know that nothing ever is.
A warrant gives you the right to buy a share in the company which
issued it at a fixed price during a fixed period. Obviously it is
cheaper than the underlying shares so you can buy more warrants than
shares for the same amount of money, and thus gear up your gains if the
shares go up or losses if they do the other thing. Its price should vary
in relation to investors' perception of the company's growth prospects
and the length of its life.
Most UK warrants have been issued by investment trusts and specialist
analysts are now arguing over how they should influence valuation
comparisons with other similar trusts which do not have warrants to
dilute their assets when they are exercised.
Smith New Court argues that you should look at the package. That means
taking the price of the share, adding to it a fifth of the price of a
warrant where, as in most cases, they have been issued at the rate of
one-for-five shares, and comparing that package with the company's net
asset value to get at the discount which can then be compared with the
discount on trusts without warrants. This is simple, it says, and
compares market capitalisations with assets in both cases. This
conflicts, however, with the Warburg idea of working out how the capital
growth of a trust will be reduced by warrants to obtain a compensatory
discount to be used in the comparison.
Now Credit Lyonnais Laing in a detailed new study maintains ''package
discounts are irrelevant'' and ''diluted discounts don't tell the whole
story''. Its system, nearer to Warburg's than to Smith New Court's,
seeks to work out a ''warrant-free'' net asset value for a share in
order to compare its discount with trusts with no warrants. It publishes
tables of warrant-free discounts at various growth rates and suggests a
number of switches. These include, for UK general trusts, a move from
Legal &amp; General Recovery to Govett Strategic.
It is an argument which will run and run. It will be interesting to
see how the publicity for the next offerings of investment trusts
tackles the problem.

STAGECOACH, the UK's largest bus operator, is still hot on the
acquisition trail, despite suffering another referral to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission earlier this week.
Chairman Brian Souter told the company's annual meeting in Perth
yesterday that Stagecoach would ''seek further selected acquisitions in
the UK at the right price'' during the current financial year.
Finance director Derek Scott said Stagecoach would probably spend less
on acquisitions this year than the #100m spent on buying eight bus
companies during the financial year to April 30.
But he said that if there were no companies for sale in a target area
for expansion, or if those available were too pricey, Stagecoach would
set up its own service from scratch.
''There is very little to stop us going into parts of the country
where there is not a target to buy and starting our own service,'' he
said.
Mr Scott said there were still plenty of large cities like Cardiff,
Manchester and Nottingham where bus services were still municipally run,
but could eventually be privatised.
Mr Souter told the AGM that Stagecoach was still interested in running
train services when the component companies of British Rail come up for
privatisation.
The board would ''examine fully railway franchising, evaluating the
risk and return issues for Stagecoach shareholders,'' he said.
Mr Scott said Stagecoach planned to bid for all of the first three
franchises to come to market -- Great Western Railways, which runs
passenger services between London and Bristol and South Wales, London
Tilbury South and South Western Trains, which operates between Waterloo
and Southampton.
Stagecoach hoped for a government decision on these seven-year rail
franchises by the end of 1996, he said.
Stagecoach has been widely criticised for its aggressive expansion
strategy and has suffered several referrals to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The MMC ordered Stagecoach to sell its 20% stake in Strathclyde Buses
last April and is still investigating two other recent acquisitions.
The latest inquiry was ordered by Consumer Affairs Minister John Evans
on Wednesday. He told the MMC to look into Stagecoach's purchase of
Chesterfield Transport because it raised concerns about competition in
Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and South Yorkshire.
Mr Souter said Stagecoach hoped to persuade the MMC that its
controversial purchases of Chesterfield in the English Midlands and
Ayrshire Bus Owners in Kilmarnock were in the public interest, because
Stagecoach was improving the quality of local bus services.
Stagecoach claims 12% to 13% of the UK bus market, but Mr Scott, the
finance director, said there was no reason why it should not expand
until it controlled 20% to 25%.

JOHN Menzies, The Edinburgh-based chain of newsagents, stationery
stores and toy shops, has reported continuing sales growth in a tough
market.
Company chairman John Menzies told the annual meeting in Edinburgh
yesterday that he expected ''a satisfactory profit level for the full
year''.
John Menzies increased its pre-tax profit by 11% to #38.1m in the year
to April, even though sales rose only 2% to #1258m.
Mr Menzies said sales had improved across the board during the first
four months of the current financial year, despite a hiccup at the Early
Learning Centre chain of toy shops and lower retail sales during the
summer heatwave.
''Sales in all divisions up to the end of August continue to show
growth, despite the weakness of the market in much of our sector,'' Mr
Menzies said.
But he warned that margins remained tight and that profits would
depend more than ever on good Christmas sales.
Mr Menzies said the acquisition of a 37% stake in Funsoft, the German
publisher and distributor of CD-ROMs in January, and the signing of a
distribution contract for Nintendo computer games, had accentuated the
seasonal nature of group profits.
John Menzies shares were unchanged at 635p.
* WALKER Group has secured a #5.8m contract to build a 40,000sq ft
supermarket and petrol station for Safeway in Glenrothes, Fife.
The Livingston-based company clinched the deal after building a
similar #7.7m superstore for Safeway at Stirling's Springkerse retail
park last year.
Walker Group sold its house building business to Beazer Homes in 1993
and now concentrates on larger projects in the leisure and retail
sectors.
The privately-owned firm made a pre-tax profit of #6.0m last year on
turnover of #31.6m.

THAT elusive feel good factor may still be missing among the vast
majority of consumers, but the more wealthy seem to be growing in
confidence, or so the experience of auction house Christies
International appears to indicate.
Total auction sales reached #460m in the first half of 1995, 18% ahead
of the same period last year. While the biggest contributor to the rise
was the US, where sales were up by 32%, the UK also grew by a
''healthy'' 12%.
The company's rapid growth in the Asia-Pacific region was maintained
with a 47% increase on 1994 and, more significantly, Christies said
yesterday, that was three times the level of 1991.
The upshot was a 24% increase in pre-tax profits from #8.1m to #10.1m.
And shareholders will get their cut with a 30% rise in the interim
dividend to 0.65p.
As with rival Sotheby's, which recently reported a 20% rise in
first-half auction sales and earnings, the biggest improvement in demand
was for impressionist and modern pictures, where sales grew by 69% in a
market which was stimulated by the offer of a number of fine
collections.
Jewellery sales, though, continued their strong growth of recent
years, with a further increase of 34%, to which the company's successful
establishment of regular sales of western and jadeite in Hong Kong and
Singapore made a substantial contribution.
Growth in excess of 20% was also achieved in nineteenth century
pictures, English &amp; Modern British pictures, prints, American furniture,
silver, coins and medals.
Among the highlights of the half-year were modern pictures and other
works of art from the collection of Mr and Mrs Ralph F Colin, which
totalled $40.6m (#25.7m); American furniture and other works of art from
the collection of Mr and Mrs Eddy Nicholson, which realised $13.6m
(#8.5m), and modern pictures from the collection of Gustav Zumsteg,
which raised #8.5m.
Four individual pictures, by Van Gogh, Modigliani, Monet, and Picasso,
were each sold for more than $10m.
Christies said that, encouragingly, the number of lots sold as a
proportion of those offered continued to rise.
Total auction revenues actually rose by 15% -- somewhat less than
sales. This was partly because of the increased proportion of high value
lots, on which both the buyer's premium and vendor's commission rates
were lower than average.
It also reflected the fierce competition for consignments. Christies
introduced a new commission structure from September 1, replacing flat
commission rate policy with a sliding scale. It is expected to have a
favourable impact on margins in the second half, but the main impact
will not be felt until next year.
Chairman Sir Anthony Tennant commented: ''With buyers increasing in
confidence over the last 12 months, and with the prospects of an
improvement in auction margins during the next 12 months, we look to the
future with cautious optimism, and we will continue to invest in the
business in order to take advantage of opportunities for growth.''
The share price firmed 4p to 212p.

SCHRODERS, the biggest of Britain's dwindling collection independent
merchant banks, saw its shares slide yesterday after lower than expected
first-half figures disappointed the market.
Pre-tax profits dropped to #85.6m from #103.2m for the six months to
the end of June, hit by rising staff costs despite a strong surge in
fees and income. The dividend rose, though, to 4.5p from 4p.
Chairman Win Bischoff put the higher wage bill down to recruitment
rather than bigger salaries or bonuses. ''While our revenues held up
well, we incurred increases in expenditure which largely arose from
growth in staff numbers,'' he said.
''Generally our returns and margins were reasonable, but we remain
mindful of the need to maintain control over our costs,'' he added.

HOWEVER successful he is, however long he survives as a manager, Jim
Jefferies will never endure the same emotional turmoil as the summer of

It was not the joining of Hearts that drained him, but the leaving of
Falkirk. The problem with Jefferies is that he is an emotional man, a
rarity in a hard-bitten old business, who finds it hard to shrug off
pangs of loyalty. It was those qualities, or perhaps flaws, which landed
him in the bizarre episode that saw him make three decisions when asked
to join Hearts.
In the same memorable, or nightmarish day, Jefferies decided he was
going to Tynecastle; decided he was staying with Falkirk; and decided he
was going to Tynecastle.
The impression from it all was that here was a man toying with the
hopes and wishes of two clubs, maybe even playing one against the other
for financial gain. None of it was remotely true. In fact, in the end he
opted for the offer which was financially less rewarding because he
could not go through with the charade in which he felt he had been
caught up.
Jefferies had been tossed the worst kind of Catch 22 dilemmas, to
choose between the team he had grown to love and the team he had always
loved. It was never going to be simple, but the choice he made
originally was the one he pursued. Between the two, there was a day of
emotional see-saw which he would not wish to experience again.
For those reasons, when Falkirk visit Tynecastle today for the first
time since the drama raised hackles from Brockville to Gorgie Road,
Jefferies' determination to concentrate solely on trying to help Hearts
win will be severely tested.
Being the man he is, it will be impossible for him not to be assailed
by confusing sensations at some stage as the club, fans and, indeed,
townsfolk, who took him deep into their affections turn up at the place
where his own ambitions have ever lain.
''I will only be focusing on a Hearts win,'' he says, but then adds:
''After the game, I want Falkirk to win every other match they play in,
except against us.''
The twin loyalties will take some time to settle, which is hardly
surprising after the five-year stint at Brockville during which he twice
won the first division, and ended up with a team consolidated in fifth
place in the premier, and very nearly in Europe.
He admits that if he had stayed at Falkirk, he might even have been
allowed a couple of seasons of failure and still retained the admiration
and affection of the fans.
It was that closeness, that togetherness, which overwhelmed him on
that Saturday in late July when he went to Brockville to tell chairman
George Fulston that he was leaving for Hearts. ''I should never have
agreed to meet George at Brockville,'' he says, ''because I put myself
under too much pressure by going there.''
Having left home after telling his wife that he was moving, Jefferies
left the manager's office after confirming to his backroom staff that he
was Tynecastle bound. Between then and emerging from the meeting with
the chairman, that resolve collapsed. His wife, like everyone else was
astonished to discover that afternoon that he was remaining at Falkirk.
Jefferies recalls the meeting and his decision with regret. ''I had
made my mind up I was going to Hearts and I allowed myself to have my
mind changed by a chairman who I suppose was doing his job. But I knew
as soon as I said I would stay I had done the wrong thing.
''People who haven't been in that positiion should remember that there
are a lot of things pressing on you. Kids were coming up and asking me
to stay, there were people outside the ground wanting me to stick with
Falkirk, there was to be a new stadium. At one moment I felt as if the
whole weight of the town was on my shoulders. It just proved too much.''
He had been offered what was an incredible seven-and-a-half-year deal
by Fulston, but the choice was never down to money or even security.
When he returned home that evening, Jefferies was a disturbed man who
knew that he had taken the wrong turning.
''I realised that I was cheating Falkirk by saying yes. I had a life's
ambition to manage Hearts, and if I hadn't taken it, I would have
regretted it for the rest of my life.
''I knew at that point that I could not cheat the club and the people
who had meant so much to me.'' He looks back at it with a genuine
regret. ''Only one man, Tommy Burns, truly appreciates the situation I
was in and he told me how similarly he felt when he was offered the
Celtic job. I am just so sorry that the time I spent with Falkirk, which
I will always remember, had to end that way.
''I get letters from Falkirk fans saying that if I had said I was
leaving and that was all, they would have thanked me and wished me
success. All I can say is that I hope they try to understand what I was
going through.'' Having endured that little exhausting chapter,
Jefferies might be forgiven for thinking the hard bit is over, but he
knows differently. Many people wonder at the wisdom of taking over a
club that has been using up managers the way Liz Taylor collects
hubbies, a club that has maybe less money than Falkirk to spend on
players and a club that has won no major honour for more than 30 years.
''I know all of that and I never expected it to be easy but you only
need to work here for a short time to realise that it is a big club.
This is the old cliche, a sleeping giant, and somebody one day will wake
it up. I'd like it to be me.
''What has helped me has been the reception I have been given from
everybody here, directors, players and fans.''
What he has tried to do immediately is instil the kind of dressing
spirit that prevailed at Brockville and which he believes is essential
if progress is to be made speedily.
He accepts that there is no money available at the moment. ''The club
is building a new stadium and obviously that means there is no spare
cash, but some day there will be, and when it arrives I hope to use it
well. In the meantime if I have to wheel and deal, I will. It is
something I am used to.''
The first thing he has done is to alter the playing sytem from the
three-at-the-back principle to the 4-4-2 base. ''It is the way I believe
we should play although, if needs be, we can use the other one for
certain occasions. The players have responded enthusiastically and I
believe they are comfortable with it. What we will try to do here is
exactly in the same principle as we did at Berwick and Falkirk. We will
aim to play attacking entertaining football.
''There will not be talk of survival here, rather more what we can
achieve. ''At the same time I have already told the players that in this
premier league you can't do it all the time. There are days when you
have to dig out a result and they have to learn to do that.
If you look at last season when teams with quality like Aberdeen,
Dundee United and Hearts had to fight against relegation while teams
like Falkirk, Kilmarnock and Partick Thistle were able to battle their
way out of trouble, you can see that you can't afford to get too
smart.'' He will make tough decisions if required but so far has been
pleasantly surprised. In fact one or two players about whom he had
preconceived thoughts have shown him he was wrong.
He daren't suggest it but likes the thought that he may be lucky as
well as good. Winning the first division title in the only two years he
was involved in it as a manager was one example. Hearts are in the
quarter finals of the Coca Cola Cup.
They couldn't, could they?

WHEN the World Mountain Running Trophy is contested on Arthur's Seat
tomorrow -- the first time the event has been held in Scotland -- the
sport will be coming home.
For hill-running may well owe its origins to Malcolm Canmore, king of
Scotland, who organised a race up 1764-foot Creag Choinnich, at Braemar,
possibly, according to historians, after defeating Macbeth at the Battle
of Lumphanan, in 1054. Others put the date at 1068.
John Grant, in Legends of the Braes o' Mar, published in 1876,
recounts how Malcolm III wanted to establish a Royal Mail, staffed by
foot-runners. By way of a practical test he offered a gold purse,
sword-belt or baldric, and a sword, to the man who raised the standard
at the summit.
''All his tenants and subjects of Braemar were therefore assembled on
the mound of the plain whereon the present castle is built,'' wrote
Grant.
No electronic timing gear or starting pistol then -- Malcolm used a
sand-glass to time the event, and struck his shield. ''The trumpet
sounded; the tartans streamed and whistled in the wind, the ground
trembled beneath their tramp.''
The contestants were well on their way when a youth, ''perspiring
profusely, scarlet with heat,'' burst into the king's circle, pleading
to be allowed to run.
The king acceded, setting a precedent for late entries. Scottish
Athletic Federation officials, obsessively opposed to same, please note.
The youngest of the three sons of M'Gregor of Ballochbuie had spotted
his brothers racing, and leapt upward ''like the vigorous goat, now
climbing on all fours, now seizing the long heather with his hands, and
drawing himself up, always up.''
He caught his brothers below the summit, and offered to drop out
provided they would give him half the prize. They refused, and he
continued. Just four yards from the finish, the eldest, sensing defeat,
grabbed his brother's kilt. But the youngster immediately unbuckled it,
staggering on to the summit to raise the standard.
Malcolm Canmore's sand-glass showed three minutes, and so the origins
of the Braemar Games claim links with one of the earliest Scottish
kings.
Queen Victoria was responsible for spiking the race. A royal estate
keeper, having won ''spit blood after running up that steep hill,''
wrote the Queen. ''The running up the hill has consequently been
discontinued.''
Nevertheless, there was a hill race at last weekend's Braemar
Gathering, won by Colin Donnelly who collected neither sword nor
baldric. But the purse amounted to #85 in cash. And Donnelly, a member
of Cambuslang Harriers, will be one of the six-strong Scotland team
tommorrow, bidding for the world title.
Formerly from Newton Mearns, but now a nurse based at Penisa'r-waun,
in Wales, Donnelly is Scotland's most illustrious mountain racer, though
at 36 professes to be slightly over the hill -- a verdict belied by his
debut Scottish international cross-country vest this year, and coming
within a minute of the Braemar record last week in appalling conditions.
The former RAF storeman has competed for Scotland in every World
Championship since their inauguration in 1985, and was runner-up in
1989, the year in which he set records on virtually every hill in the
country.
He was a founder of the Scottish Hill Runners Association, formed
because of the inadequacy of their English counterparts, the FRA. ''I've
nothing but contempt for them, particularly given the way they are
trying to treat Scotland as a region, and have more British championship
races in England, to Scotland's detriment,'' says Donnelly. Canmore
would have approved.
But his animosity lies deeper. After he had won the British title
thrice in succession, the FRA was effectively responsible for blocking
Donnelly's entry to the 1990 Ben Nevis race -- ''a deliberate attempt to
sabotage me, preventing me winning for a record fourth consecutive time.
Not that there was any money involved -- it's all for a handshake and a
tankard. I do it for the crack.''
Two bad ankle injuries have affected Donnelly. ''I haven't the
psychological ability to descend like I used to,'' he admits. ''There's
a bit of a block. You need a kamikaze attitude to descending. I never
used to think where I put my feet. Now I do, and that slows you.''

HEARTS' chairman Chris Robinson has few illusions left about the size
of the job he has taken on at Tynecastle. Nor does he deny that before
he can succeed in making Hearts a power in the land again, he must,
first of all, lay the ghost of Wallace Mercer.
The larger-than-life former chairman of the Edinburgh club was a
high-profile football supremo, a man with some style, and one who
enjoyed the limelight that the game brought him.
Robinson is different, and he has suffered because of that. That is a
fact he has learned to live with in his first roller-coaster year
running one of Scottish football's great institutions.
But Robinson will not change. There is a tough core to the man who
bought out Mercer, and has since been involved in acrimonious exchanges
with the one time Lord of Tynecastle, and is still tied up in a legal
battle with him.
The 45-year-old, who has a catering business, states firmly: ''I will
not change my method of running the club. Look, what we had here before
was a bit of a publicity circus, with Wallace as the ringmaster, and all
the attention went to the chairman.
''I don't see my role that way at all. I want to get on with the
business of making Hearts strong again by working away in the
background. I don't like publicity. I don't want it personally. What I
do want is to see Hearts getting stronger because of the work which is
being done in the background.
''I have made mistakes and I think I am honest enough to own up to
them. It is not as easy a job as I had thought when we first came in.
''And, you're right, the ghost of Wallace is still around the
corridors of Tynecastle. He brought the club some success, almost gave
the support the trophies they wanted, and had them playing in Europe.
That is what we would like to do -- but in a less flamboyant way.''
Of course, it has to be a little less flamboyant than the era of the
Great Waldo. For one thing Hearts have a crippling overdraft which is
approaching #5m. And they have been forced, like all other clubs, into a
rebuilding programme which has diverted money from the playing side to
the new look stadium.
Robinson, however, has plans to restructure the club's debt. He wishes
to change the method of repayment, avoiding the overdraft charges which
must threaten the club's current ambitions.
What Robinson would like is a loan of some kind to be repaid over a
lengthy period of time. If he gets that, then both he and Hearts would
be given breathing space.
He explains: ''We have this debt -- and I don't want to go into
specifics about it, but it is considerable. And we have to service that
each month. If it can be restructured as I visualise, then we will be
able to provide money to strengthen the team. That is, after all, what
the fans want. I know that because I have been a Hearts' fans since I
was a boy.
''I can remember my mother taking me down to Princes Street to see the
team coming back with the Scottish Cup, and I have been committed to the
cause ever since.
''But, being on the other side now, I also realise that there are
problems off the field which have to be addressed. There is no
alternative to some of them and what we must do is achieve a viable
financial structure, and then build on that.''
That is not to say that Robinson will sacrifice the playing side of
the game on the altar of commercial success. He has hopes that the
changes he has made in the managerial position will help to propel the
club towards a European place.
He admits, though: ''I am still upset about having to end Tommy
McLean's contract because I felt when he was appointed that he would
guide the team to the success we want here.
''It didn't happen. It just didn't work out and there are various
resons for that. But I still retain respect for Tommy's coaching
abilities. Now, we have Jim Jefferies here and, like me, he is a Hearts
man. That is what we want at this stage of the club's development.
''What I do know now about football is that the game eventually
consumes you and your family. Because of that, there have been times
when I have regretted the takeover, times when I have had to take some
stick, but now I believe that I am winning over the support.
''They know that I am a Hearts man, and they know that I want the same
as them -- success for this club.
''And that goes for the whole Robinson family. My wife came along at
the start of last season to dip her toe in the water so to speak. Now
she sits and talks tactics with me at home. That is how this game gets
you.''
Robinson is learning, just as others before him. Rangers' David Murray
has, he says, helped to guide him through the minefield of football
politics.
But, more than anything, what Robinson needs is just a hint of the
success Murray has enjoyed. One trophy win, just one, would lay the
ghost which haunts Hearts' present owner.
That, I feel, remains a long way off.

* TO wander down Edinburgh's Victoria Street this past week or two has
been to experience a strong sense of deja vu, writes WENDY JACK.
Just where this ancient street of specialist shops, rounds its final
bend before the Grassmarket, the legendary, now-deceased Mrs Iris Fox's
Olde Curiousity Shoppe -- which specialised in Wemyss Ware -- appears to
have been reincarnated. The name, though, has not.
This time around, the windows are filled with Wemyss pottery
lookalikes, the work of Griselda Hill Pottery in Fife. And, unlike the
teasing Mrs Fox's day, when she regularly refused to part with pieces
from her collection, every item is for sale.
Griselda Hill has long been a fan of Wemyss Pottery, and even created
faithful reproductions of the work of the original pottery for Mrs Fox.
When the old lady's collection was auctioned last year by Sotheby's, it
raised more than a quarter-of-a-million pounds and included several
examples of Griselda Hill's work.
She says: ''Since the sale, there has been increasing interest in
Wemyss pieces, and the demand for my own work is growing steadily. The
shop is an opportunity to make the pottery more widely available, and it
is particularly appropriate that it is in Mrs Fox's old premises, which
I tried to acquire, unsuccessfully, in the past.''
Wemyss-style cats are Griselda Hill's biggest sellers apparently,
while the famous pigs -- currently liable to cost a cool #2500 or so for
an original -- are her most expensive pieces at well under #200.
Enthusiasts with tight budgets can note that the lowest priced pieces,
brooches, start around #13.

IT was was one of the wettest ever days yesterday at the annual Kelso
ram sales, but the weather did nothing to dampen the trade.
The highlight of the event was a record set when Jimmy Douglas,
Woodhead of Carness, Fraserburgh, sold a March-born Suffolk ram lamb for
#23,000. That was about #3000 better than the old record established
three years ago, but considerably less than the 68,000 guineas Mr
Douglas paid in July for a ram lamb in Edinburgh.
Commenting on the price after the sale, Mr Douglas said: ''This is the
first lamb off Stockton Slocum which I bought last year for 14,000
guineas and out of the outstanding Prelude line.''
The buyer was John Sinnett, Stockton Court, Worcester, and he had come
to Kelso quite determined to buy this lamb despite having forked out
26,000 guineas for another of Mr Douglas's sheep last year. He said of
his latest purchase: ''He's got style and character and is superb on his
legs. He's simply the best here today.''
Mr Sinnett also revealed that the ram will only likely be used this
year, adding: ''I'll take some semen, but really I am buying a year
ahead of my needs.''
Good sheep throughout the sale commanded a significant premium on an
occasion when no less than three more Kelso records were broken. The
former NFU president Jim Stobo set a new high for a Border Leicester,
selling a shearling from his Tweedside flock at #4000 to Raymond
Harding, Shrewsbridge, Nantwich, Cheshire.
Better still, David Hall, Lillyburn, Penicuik, exceeded that with a
new Blue Faced Leicester record of #4600, selling jointly to Arthur
Yates, Millhouse, Hexham, Willie Wearmouth, Rosehill, Bishop Auckland,
and Mrs Glen Shapiro, Hazelwood, Penrith.
The final record came when a Charollais from Brian Atkinson,
Scratchmere Scar, Penrith, sold at #1400 to Billy Ingram, Logie Durno,
Inverurie.
Back among the Suffolks, which dominate numerically at Kelso every
year, George Stuart, Milton of Birness, Ellon, Aberdeenshire, sold his
best at #5800 to Russell Jones, Haverfordwest, Wales.
However, this was substantially bettered late in the sale when Ronald
Black, Newton of Collessie, Ladybank, Fife, sold his leader at #6500 in
a joint deal to Jimmy Wilson, Barnyards, Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire, and
John Sherratt, Pankymoor, Wem, Shropshire.

Spinach has had to live with a limp reputation. Now it's time to
consider its rehabilitation, says Lady Claire MacDonald
THE very word spinach conjures up an image of Popeye pouring the
contents of a can of it down his throat, after which he is so infused
with energy that he can defeat any giant foe foolish enough to cross his
path. I think it was intended to improve the image of spinach, which
used to be a food which made people curl their lips in distaste.
These are changed days. Spinach is wonderful, and it is yet another
example of how times alter our attitude to certain foods. Until recently
the only way we could use spinach, unless we grew our own, was to buy it
frozen. A blind tasting would have given no clue as to its identity. But
these days it's possible to buy fresh spinach so easily -- though not
yet, alas, in the Co-op in Broadford.
It does vary depending on where you buy it. I reckon the best is the
baby spinach to be found in Marks &amp; Spencer. It is delicious, completely
free of grit, and young and tender enough to be eaten in salads. Some
supermarkets sell bags of spinach which is large and leathery of
texture, and full of grit. You do need to pick over this type of spinach
very carefullyand to wash it well.
Spinach reduces down to almost nothing when cooked, and so the best
way to cook spinach is to microwave it. If you don't have a microwave,
steaming is the next best method. It needs the briefest cooking time,
just until the leaves wilt.
Then there are many different ways to use spinach. After serving it
raw, my next favourite way to serve it is to cook as I've described,
then to pour about two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over it, a
squeeze of lemon juice, salt and lots of black pepper, mixing all
together well. As the spinach cools it absorbs the taste of the oil and
lemon. It is served at room temperature, as it is in Italy.
Spinach is also delicious, whizzed, when cooked, to a smooth puree,
flavoured with salt, pepper and nutmeg, with butter or double cream --
single tends to curdle on reheating. You can then put poached eggs on
this puree, and cover them with a good cheesy sauce; this is the classic
Eggs Florentine. But you can substitute firm-fleshed white fish, or
smoked fish, instead of eggs. All you need to accompany this is warm
bread or rolls.
Spinach mixes very well with apples or with pears in soup. Saute
onions until they are turning golden at the edges, then add the chopped
apples (or pears) and the spinach leaves, stock and seasoning -- salt,
pepper and nutmeg -- and simmer the lot together for about 7-10 minutes.
Once it is liquidised and sieved (for velvety smoothness) you have most
delicious soup. You may need to spike its flavour with a squeeze of
lemon or lime juice. You can serve this soup hot or cold, whichever the
weather dictates.
When whizzed to a puree, as before, then mixed with creamy goat's
cheese and a combination of whole eggs and egg yolks (to give a softer
texture to the cooked filling) spinach makes a good filing for a savoury
tart.
Spinach is a very simple main component of a pasta lunch or supper
dish. As a family we would eat pasta about five days each week -- this
is simple. I boil pasta until it is al dente, or tender enough for me to
stick my thumbnail into. Drain the pasta, and mix with extra virgin
olive oil, very finely chopped garlic and finely chopped anchovies (both
optional) and plenty of torn up baby spinach leaves. Toss the spinach
around in the hot pasta, which will have sufficient heat to wilt the
leaves. Serve with freshly grated parmesan cheese and season with plenty
of black pepper -- no extra salt is needed if you include the anchovies.

Michael Fry watches the Jacobite entourage indulge in another charm
offensive with the apprehensive burghers of Perth
PERTH, September 9 -- Prince Charles Edward Stuart and his Highland
chiefs have decided to advance immediately on Edinburgh. It should take
no more than 48 hours to prepare for their onward march from Perth,
which they captured five days ago.
The Jacobites agree the capital must be their next goal. The
psychological advantage of reaching it would be enormous, and could
encourage France to send the reinforcements that the prince hopes for.
His own army, recruited mostly from the clans, numbers as yet only 2400.
That, however, is already more than the Jacobites managed to raise in
their last uprising in 1719, and double the number with which he marched
into defenceless Perth, the first Scottish town he has taken. This coup
prompted a second wave of open declarations in favour of the Stuart
cause, as many of the local gentry joined up with chieftains from the
north whom they used to fear and despise.
Charles reached Perth late on September 4 after a forced march of 30
miles from Blair Atholl. His entry to the town was another of his
perfectly staged events. Few of the townsmen can really be for him, yet
they cheered at the sight of a Jacobite dream coming true. The prince
rode before his soldiers in a suit of tartan trimmed with gold lace. At
the Cross, surrounded by a swarm of exultant Jacobites, he had James
VIII proclaimed King and himself Regent.
Charles went out of his way to woo the crowds. As a result, Perth has
feted him. He has been constantly invited to balls, arousing only the
complaint that he never stays long enough. To make clear that his
personal Catholic faith will not hinder his commitment to religious
toleration, he has been careful to attend an Episcopalian service. He is
said to have boasted in a letter to his father: ''I have got their
hearts.''
A different story is told by agents of the Government still in the
town. One reports that Jacobite support comes from those ''who had
little to lose, bankrupts, Papists, and such as were outlawed by Church
and State'', arriving in Perth ''as to an asylum''. But it cannot be
denied that some are men of substance.
Among them is Lord George Murray, 51-year-old youngest brother of the
Duke of Atholl, an able if dictatorial soldier respected as ''duine
firinneach'', truthful or righteous man, on his estates. Though he
fought in the rebellions of 1715 and 1719, his decision to come out for
the Stuarts was unexpected.
Pardoned in 1725, he had set about repairing his family's fortunes and
struck up a friendship with Duncan Forbes of Culloden, now Lord
President of the Court of Session and organiser of the Government's
defences in the North. So certain did his Hanoverian allegiance appear
until this week that he has been appointed sheriff-depute for Atholl,
presumably with the purpose of keeping the district loyal.
But it turns out that he is still a Jacobite by conviction. He wrote
to his Whig brother: ''My life, my fortune, my expectations, the
happiness of my wife and children are all at stake, and the chances are
against me, and yet a principle of what seems to me, honour, and my duty
to the King and country outweighs everything.''
This reluctance, together with his blunt manner and his official
links, made for a strained first meeting with the prince, especially
when he started laying down the law about organisation of the Jacobite
army. Charles said to him: ''It is the obedience of my subjects I
desire, not their advice''. Even so, he has made Murray his
Lieutenant-General.
He will hold that post jointly with the 32-year-old Duke of Perth, a
big landowner in the county, good-natured and popular for speaking broad
Scots to his tenants, as for his interest in horse-racing. Despite a
weak constitution, the result of being crushed by a barrel when he was a
boy, he has military experience from service as an engineer in France,
where he was also educated at the Scots College, Douai. A member of an
avowedly Jacobite family, he just escaped being caught and locked up in
his castle before he could join the prince's army.
Support from these two allows Charles to establish something like a
proper military chain of command. As Lieutenants-General, they will have
the same number of men under their direct control and enjoy supreme
authority on alternate days. In practice, however, Perth is likely to
defer to Murray, who will in effect be commander-in-chief. Thomas
O'Sullivan, one of the Seven Men of Moidart, has been appointed
Quartermaster.
The prince's next priority is money, since he entered Perth with only
a guinea in his pocket. He has appointed collectors to gather taxes from
Perth, Dundee, and other places now under his control. He asserted that
a lawful King had every right to levy excise, but this did not satisfy
the town council of Perth. Charles had to lobby the indignant bailies in
person.
He needs the money to provision his army for its further advance. If
the Highlanders are not fed, they melt away to plunder their own
supplies. So far, except for some small incidents involving Glengarry's
and Keppoch's men, this has been avoided. Even an agent of the
Government concedes that the Jacobites ''keep good discipline and pay
for everything''.
This is largely due to Murray, who drills the troops regularly and
punishes insubordination. He has ordered Perth's bakers to supply
loaves, and requisitioned pokes or knapsacks for the clansmen to carry
their bread. They are expected to march out towards Dunblane on
September 11.

* NESTLING in the back streets of the picturesque fishing village of
Crail is Crail Pottery, a family business run by Stephen and Carol
Greive, aided by their son and daughter. This is very much a small
business with everyone chipping in their skills and ideas to make the
various pots, mugs and bowls which are to be found in a
higgledy-piggledy manner in the showroom above the workroom.
Originally Stephen studied science at St Andrews University but he
was, like his father before him, a ''maker'' and left the world of
science to be a potter. That was about 30 years ago. ''Things are
changing all the time,'' admits Stephen. ''We started by making
incredibly rough cooking pots which were all the rage, it was the
Sixties and people wanted to buy earthy ethnic pottery . . . no colours,
just sludge. It was great because that's the only colour we could make
at the time and it was incredible -- we exported to Japan and America.''
Carol and Stephen sell now only from their own pottery as that's what
works for them best and they get some 40,000 people passing through a
year. Stephen still likes to concentrate on the more earthy products.
''I'm making big pots at the moment, I'm the only one who really throws
big ones but we are definitely into colours now.
''If you weren't into colour you would go out of business. We are
market-led -- not just doing our own thing.''
They bought the pottery, which was then derelict, for #250 and
renovated it themselves. They have not expanded a great deal but Carol
is quite happy about that. ''We don't make big runs of anything; we are
a tiny business. This is a kind of third world business we are running
in the first world. It's a crazy thing to try and do anyway.''
However, the Greives have to keep an eye on the third world as Carol
pointed out. ''There are so many pots coming from third world countries
which are really cheap. It's a bit of a worry.''
Crail has developed by having a very diverse range of goods and
designs from a #2.99 posy bowl to a full punch set at #90, and at the
moment people are snapping up ceramic fountains at around #130. When
people buy a piece of pottery from Crail, Stephen believes they are just
getting not just fired clay but a chunk of the Greives's lifestyle.
''The yard is Mediterranean and there is always something going on for
people them to see: decorating pots, babies crying . . . We don't push
the product as much as the family aspect; that's what folk are
interested in.''
Indeed, it seems to be so -- customers love the family photos on the
wall beside the hanging plates. When they have finished looking at the
photos they can see the family in action, decorating and throwing the
pots.
The whole set-up seems ideal; but even a perfect world has some down
sides, as Stephen explains. ''We have the same regulations as ICI. We
have all the factory inspectors and the planners, not to mention VAT
men. We have a hell of a time.'' As well as that, Stephen says there are
other problems being a potter. ''It's dirty and cold, I've got a sore
back, and my fingers are going numb.''
To get away from the pressures of running a small business, both Carol
and Stephen take themselves off into their organic garden which runs
down to the sea. It is immense and provides the family with a fresh
supply of vegetables. There is even a greenhouse which, in September,
gives a harvest of grapes. They have hens, and fresh lobster is provided
by a small boat which the family own.
To the customer who wanders round the potters yard it does really look
like The Good Life; but what Carol is looking forward to is a bit of
continuity round the house. ''We use all our own pottery at home but
it's mostly seconds. One day, what I want is a really nice matching set
for the house.''

LORD LINDSAY, the Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, brought both
good and bad news to the rain-soaked crowd at yesterday's Kelso ram
sales, writes DAN BUGLASS.
First he said: ''I'm delighted to announce that as of Thursday evening
no less than #36.7m of the Sheep Annual Premium had been paid, out of a
total of #50m.'' At the same date last year no payments had been made.
However, when pressed on the matter of the proposals by the European
Commission in Brussels to introduce a single retention period for SAP,
Lord Lindsay said that while he appreciated the strength of opposition,
there were problems.
He said: ''There will be winners and losers whatever system we have,
so it's important we choose a period where there are as many winners as
possible.
''We in the department were happy with two periods, but the European
Union auditors had proof that the system could be abused, so we have to
fight to get the best answer for Scotland.''
The actual consultation period ends next week, and department
officials have said that a decision will be reached quickly.
The implications of the UK failing to comply with Brussels, said Lord
Lindsay, might be considerable. He explained: ''It could be as much as
#100m in Scotland if we were to suffer a complete disallowance of SAP.''
Responding to reports that Douglas Hogg, the Minister of Agriculture,
was preparing to approach the commission for extra sheep quota to help
the ''developer category'', which is in a state of turmoil, Lord Lindsay
said: ''It's news to me, but I would be happy to go to Brussels to fight
for anything which will help Scottish farmers.
''Sometimes when things appear set in stone it's worth keeping on
fighting to win concessions.''

THERE are times when you become really lucky when a parcel arrives at
your door -- you can find a new CD or, better still, a collectors' item
LP, or when things work out especially well you can find a book on the
song writer Johnny Mercer . . .
That is what happened to me the other week and I have Jean Bach -- who
directed the film A Great Day in Harlem -- to thank for that. Her late
husband, Bob Bach, put together the book with the assistance of Mercer's
widow, Ginger.
It was a labour of love, painstakingly compiled by two people who
loved Mercer and his poetry. And, after all, it is poetry we are
examining when we look at the man's lyrics.
Mercer was a jazzer from way back. The book, Our Huckleberry Friend,
published by Lye Stuart in the United States, confirms that. It
chronicles the rise of the man from Savannah, Georgia, to his
pre-eminent position as his country's foremost lyricist.
And, always the book stresses his love of jazz. It was Mercer who put
the words of Ziggy Elman's Swing Era anthem And the Angels Sing; to
Eddie Miller's Lazy Mood; to Lionel Hampton's Midnight Sun; to Duke
Elington's Satin Doll and unforgettably Ralph Burns's Early Autumn.
Who can forget some of these beautiful Mercer lyrics:
There's a dance pavilion in the rain
All shuttered down,
A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely
The feelings for people and places and their problems that Mercer
understood so well shine through just as they did in his
never-to-be-topped torch song One For My Baby.
I met Mercer just once. I was in London for an England v Scotland
international at Wembley and he was in town working on a musical verion
of J B Priestley's Good Companions with Andre Previn.
My intention had been to interview Mercer for a jazz magazine but he
wanted to talk about other things rather than himself. He was going to
meet Priestley the following day which excited him; and he asked about
the Tartan Army which had begun to invade the West End; and, finally, we
talked most of all about a shared passion for the song writer Willard
Robison.
Mercer's career was littered with his jazz connections, recordings
with Goodman and Whiteman, with Jack Teagarden and Wingy Manone;
broadcasts with the Bob Crosby Orchestra and with Louis Armstrong.
His voice, soaked in molasses and Jack Daniels, with a constant hint
of magnolia blossoms, is as unmistakable as any of his songs.
The last time I heard it personally was that same London weekend when
I was called to the phone in the White House Hotel in London. I fought
my way through dozens of other Scots drowning their sorrows -- we had
lost 1-0 -- to hear that voice tell me how unlucky my team had been and
how he had enjoyed our converstaion. That was the man. A gracious
Southern gentleman who was able to pick up on city life and yet still
feel the Savannah bonds of his youth.
Waitin' Round the bend,
My Huckleberry Friend
That's the sub-title of the book, the character of the man. Go out and
get it. You won't be disappointed.
If you require musical, as well as verbal, evidence of Mercer's
greatness, then look for his one-man show available on DRG Records where
the man himself sings and reminisces or a golden era of popular song.

The Herald's regular team of reviewers listen to the best sounds
around
Southpaw Grammar; Morrissey (RCA)
* THUMPING post-post grunge from the master of grudge. Muscular
melodies and accusatory words. Mr Mozza: reports of his artistic dearth
greatly exaggerated.
Iaora Tahiti; Mouse From Mars (Too Pure)
* FOR once a press release which does not mislead. ''Feel the
algorhythmic bliss machine'' it advises, hymning the gentle synth-pulses
which propel this squeaky Kraftwerkian opus onward and upward. Who are
Mouse on Mars? Two blokes issuing interplanetary transmissions which
will lead you to say ''No cheese, please,'' thus forming a perfect
smile.
Dope On Plastic 2; various (React)
* JUST when you thought it was safe to pretend that you knew all about
yon blunted trip hop . . . more skew-whiffed grooves from three of the
acts featured on Dope 1 -- the Woodshed, Red Snapper and A.P.E. -- plus
a whole new crew of freaked-out jazz-juicers. Taste the strange
smouldering hugeness of Sensimilla by Dillinger's Massive Dub Beats!
Savour the baroque minimalism of Cool Breeze! Don't be a complete dope!
Treat yourself to some fantastic plastic.
Schumann: Dichterliebe, Wolfgang Holzmair (Philips)
* AUSTRIAN baritone Holzmair gave one of the most committed Queen's
Hall recitals in the recent Edinburgh Festival. Every number was
delivered with theatrical and almost operatic intensity -- in yer face
recital singing. That intensity suffuses a beautiful new recording of
Schumann's great song cycle on A Poet's Love -- rich baritone warmth and
a light, high tenor quality of voice. Spellbinding singing enforced by
the cool, clear pianism of Imogen Cooper. Disc also includes the
Liederkreis cycle and other settings of poems by Heinrich Heine
Schumann Piano Works: Maria Joao Pires (DG)
* ONE of the outstanding performances at the Edinburgh Festival was by
the elfin, skelf-like Portuguese pianist, Maria Joao Pires, she of the
fragile, little-girl-lost look, and the muscles of tempered steel. The
work with which she tore into her festival programme -- Robert
Schumann's typically schizophrenic, ultra-poetic and turbulent Three
Romances, features on this superb new disc, which also includes the
Forest Scenes, the Arabeske, and the Carnival from Vienna. Stunning
pianism of great insight. A must for collectors.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Monkjack, Jack Bruce (CMP)
* Supported by his own concise piano playing and Bernie Worrell's
apposite Hammond organ, Bruce showcases his magnificent voice across the
full range of expression from roaring, pleading blues to the nigh on
hymnal. The aptly titled Tightrope is a typically fearless performance
from an artist who has never been afraid to take risks, which this time
pay off handsomely.
Tamburello, Peter King (Miles Music)
* Best known as a lucid keeper of Charlie Parker's alto saxophone
flame, King features here in impressively expansive mood, easing both
alto and soprano through arrangements of Purcell, Gershwin and Bartok,
confident ballads as well as his own blazingly em
otional tribute to racing driver Ayrton Senna, the scene of whose
death the title refers to.
ROB ADAMS
Jazzin' the Blues -- 18 Cool Jazz Moods, Various (Music Club)
* THIS excellent compilation is as interesting to the jazz connoisseur
as to the lay listener, and far superior to any previous collection of
''jazz moods''. The 76 minutes include such unfamiliar delights as Gerry
Mulligan's sumptuous Laura, Thelonious Monk's surprisingly fluid take on
Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers' funky Whisper
Not. Other not-so-obvious, but inspired, choices are the Al Cohn and
Zoot Sims duet of East of the Sun and Chet Baker's hauntingly
contemplative Over the Rainbow.
En Concert, Gerry Mulligan and the Concert Jazz Band (Europe1)
* ANOTHER great buy. This time a double CD-long recording of a superb
concert given by the celebrated Concert Jazz Band in Paris, in November
1960. Among the starry line-up are tenor man Zoot Sims, trombonist Bob
Brookmeyer, trumpeter Conte Candoli and drummer Mel Lewis. Go wild with
the audience over the exhilaratingly swinging versions of You Took
Advantage of Me and Moten Swing; and the sulky, atmospheric Black
Nightgown and Barabra's Theme from the noir film I Want to Live. This
was clearly a night to remember -- even if you weren't there.

<HEADLINE>More may go in Yarrow job cuts. Recovery hopes rest on securing Navy contract as yard announces 415 redundancies.</HEADLINE>

YARROW Shipbuilders yesterday announced 415 redundancies and warned
that further job losses were inevitable if the Clydeside yard did not
win more orders soon.
The next few months will be crucial for the yard, which is pinning its
hopes on securing a multi-million-pound contract to build three more
Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy, an order which in turn could help
to attract more overseas business, vital for Yarrow's future.
However, it could be December before the Ministry of Defence announces
its decision. Even if that order does come to Yarrow, it is too little
and too late to avoid redundancies among the workforce of 3100 now.
It has been known for some time that a substantial jobs cut was in the
offing, but yesterday's announcement still came as a blow to the workers
at the Scotstoun yard.
The 415 redundancies affect mainly steel workers because most of the
fabrication work on existing contracts has been completed. The cuts will
take effect before the end of the year.
Managing director Murray Easton said: ''Naturally, any redundancies
are bitterly regretted, but we have explored every opportunity and
option to try to avoid this.''
Indeed, the yard had managed to delay the cutback until now by
utilising a flexibility agreement to transfer surplus steel workers to
work in the outfitting trade, he said.
Given the scale of the cuts, it was almost inevitable that there would
be some compulsory redundancies.
The yard has already built several Type 23 frigates and has high hopes
of winning the MoD order for a further three.
Mr Easton said: ''We have been informed officially that there will be
no announcement before November, although more realistically it could be
December.''
The order was absolutely crucial to the yard, and such an endorsement
from the Government would help the company in its marketing efforts to
win work in a number of export countries.
Mr Easton said there would be no more redundancies this year, but
pointed out that existing work in the yard's order book would run out in
February, 1997, and added: ''If we are not successful in persuading
customers to place work with us by demonstrating our efficiency and
reliability, then there will be further redundancies.''
He also warned that any industrial action in response to the cutback
announced yesterday would have very serious consequences for the yard.
''It would be suicide if potential customers saw any disruption to our
programme of work.''
After senior shop stewards at the yard were told about the
redundancies, Mr Ian Jackson, division personnel manager, said: ''There
was no surprise. They have been expecting it. I think their expectation
was to have greater job losses.''
However, shop stewards' convener Dougie Conroy said last night: ''It
is a bit worse than we expected, it is more than we thought it would
be.''
Asked if there was any suggestion of industrial action, Mr Conroy
said: ''If the workforce does decide to take some form of action to
achieve a severance deal, then Murray Easton has to shoulder some of the
blame because we did have an agreement on severance pay but the company
decided to put that agreement in the bin two years ago.''
He added: ''The future is very unclear and nobody in the yard can be
complacent. I am sure that the workforce will look at the overall
situation. If the workforce did take action, I think that the company
would have to move quickly to avert any adverse publicity.''
Mr Richard Leonard, assistant secretary of the Scottish Trades Union
Congress, said the announcement had ''come out of the blue''.
He said: ''Some job cuts had been anticipated, but not now, and not on
this scale. That suggests to us that these redundancies are about more
than just a gap in the order book.''
South of the Border, too, there was gloomy news on the jobs front
yesterday as Eastern Electricity, Britain's biggest electricity
supplier, announced it was cutting 400 jobs in a bid to keep prices
down, and British Steel said it was laying off 520 workers at a plant
near Wolverhampton because of over-capacity in world markets.
There was some good news, however, when Japanese electronics giant
Fujitsu announced a #816m expansion which will create 500 jobs at the
company's plant in county Durham.

Chef, part-time firefighter and now successful publican, Keith Kemsley
tells John Buchanan what drove him to buy his former local, Killearn's
Old Mill Inn
WHEN Keith Kemsley came home from Australia he was so saddened to
discover one of his old haunts was inpoor shape that he decided to buy
it.
Kemsley had been working as a chef in a restaurant on Sydney's Manly
Beach, and when he revisited the Old Mill Inn in Killearn for a drink
with friends he realised the establishment had become run down. ''It had
been a very successful public house when I frequented it,'' he says,
''and when I returned I was surprised when I saw the state it was in.''
He immediately resolved to do something about it, but the owners did
not respond to his offer to buy, and a few months later the Old Mill Inn
closed its doors. But his desire to restore his former local to its
previous glory did not fade, and when the bank put the property up for
sale, he was among the bidders.
In July last year his offer was accepted and six weeks later he
re-opened the doors of the Old Mill Inn. ''It was a busy six weeks,'' he
recalls. ''Not only was the place very run down but it had also been
broken into while it was closed, and it was a bit of a mess.''
With the help of a #25,000 overdraft facility he began refurbishing
the premises, but he says he is glad most of the bills did not become
due for payment until after he was open for business and the tills had
begun to tinkle.
In the first week after re-opening, the 18-seat restaurant served 200
meals, and since then the graph has shown a steady increase. This summer
600 customers have been passing through it every week.
Speaking in front of a log fire in the bar, an appropriate setting for
someone enjoying the warm glow of success, Kemsley says: ''Our turnover
is evenly divided between the food and drink service, and we try to
offer customers something more than normal pub food -- for a start, it
is fresh.''
He has put into practice the lessons he has learned in the hospitality
trade since 1990 when he gained an HND at what was then Napier College
in Edinburgh.
After graduating he first worked at Norton House Hotel in Edinburgh
before going to Australia for a spell. Since returning from Down Under
he has worked in several establishments including a small hotel in
Glasgow. ''I have done most jobs in the catering trade,'' he says,
''from washing dishes to barman and reception.''
He has put this experience to good use in the refurbished Old Mill Inn
which, he explains, aims as far as possible to suits all tastes.
''Killearn is a small village, and the people who live here range from
the very rich to the unemployed. Our meals in the restaurant can cost
#15 a head, but you can have a baked potato snack in the bar.''
But it is not only the locals Kemsley finds himself catering for as a
former regular customer turned host. Killearn, with a population of
around 2000, is close to the West Highland Way, and many of the walkers
spend the first night on the 95-mile walk in the comfort of one of the
four bedrooms in the guest house attached to the pub-cum-restaurant.
''Many of the walkers don't want to be too ambitious on their first
day walking so they stop overnight with us. We also have visiting
business people who do not want to stay in Glasgow coming for an
overnight stay.''
Despite the success of his business Kemsley has found time to be
involved in the community, playing for the local Strathendrick rugby
club which the Old Mill Inn sponsors, and although not a player himself
he also sponsors Killearn football club.
More unusually, he is also a part-time fireman, and three or four
times a week customers will see him rushing from the inn in response to
an emergency call. ''We all have a pager and it takes me between two and
three minutes to reach the fire appliance at Balfron.''
In the year he has been a firefighter the part-time brigade has dealt
with everything from house fires to a blazing combine harvester. It has
also been called to free a horse stuck in a horse box.
When he is not helping to put out fires, Kemsley is thinking of ways
to improve his business. He has plans to turn a patio outside the inn
into a conservatory restaurant, and has already started to offer outside
catering for functions. ''One of our first catering jobs was the fire
brigade's annual dance, which I suppose was really putting ourselves in
the firing line, but this side of the business is expanding.''
Although it is slightly off the main tourist route to the Trossachs,
the Old Mill, he says, receives its fair share of tourist trade during
the summer months. He admits, however, that this side of the business
could be bigger, which is why he is trying to convince Central Region
that he should be allowed to put a sign up on the main tourist route
drawing attention to the inn's existence.
''The planning authorities are against roadside signs, but we believe
the tourist board is trying to convince the Scottish Office that it
should change its general stance on this issue.''
The Old Mill Inn provides eight full-time jobs and another 16
part-time positions. Kemsley looks after the office administration and
leaves the front of house operations to a manager. ''I help wherever I
am needed, mostly in the kitchen as that is where most of my experience
is, but I am a bonus not a necessity in any of these positions.''
It is having such a healthy staffing position that no doubt helps him
to answer his firefighter pager so promptly. He may rush to a fire, but
the young innkeeper has no plans to rush into buying another
establishment. ''I will only buy another place if I think it is the
right place, and the time is right,'' he declares.

THIS week's trailblazing entrepreneur has a global vision. He believes
passionately that where he has led, others can follow, that Scotland's
future wealth can be built upon the kind of creativity he has
demonstrated in establishing his own company -- Memory Corporation.
Alex Deas is the chairman and technical director of Memory, a highly
sophisticated micro-electronics firm. Based in Dalkeith, it is the
successor to a systems products design company -- Signal Resources --
which he founded in 1989. As managing director of the latter, he came to
realise that most of the Californian computer companies who formed his
client base had grown rapidly from small beginnings, a staggering
contrast to the British experience.
There were, he thought, various reasons for this. The different
approach to wealth creation meant that, instead of growing organically,
vast sums were invested to ensure the success of any enterprise. And
these investments were made with long-term objectives in mind.
Another factor, he decided, was the vision and expertise of the
executive officers of these Silicon Valley electronics companies: they
were overwhelmingly engineers whose knowledge of the product was
crucial, but they also understood the importance of the world market.
This global vision meant the real wealth creating core of the company --
the design and skill in signal technology, the logistics and the
decision making -- remained in California, while other contributions to
its rapid growth and huge profits were bought where they were cheapest
-- in the Third World, or Scotland where local government incentives and
relatively low wages attract many US companies.
Deas has highly specialised skills -- he built his first computer at
14, and went on to gain an honours degree in electronics and computer
science, a PhD in micro-electronics and then to teach at Edinburgh
University. His skills were being bought in to solve technical and
design problems for these Californian companies. He realised that, if he
could find a product, he could replicate the Californian experience on
this side of the Atlantic.
During the past three decades, and increasingly as memory chips have
become more complex, manufacturers all over the globe have been trying
to find a method of correcting the defects which inevitably arise in the
course of their manufacture. Thousands of academic papers have been
written, scores of patents taken out, numerous schemes have been tried.
None has solved the problem of the waste of half the world's wafer
output. Until 1994.
That was when Deas and his team finally developed a valuable new
technological tool -- the variance-controlled memory. VCMs allow DRAMs
and other memory devices with randomly distributed non-functioning cells
to be returned to full functionality.
In recycling memory chips which might otherwise be scrapped, this
technology (which is part silicon and part software solution), brings
enormous benefits both to manufacturers and customers, improving the
former's yields and profits, and helping to meet rapidly growing demand
from the latter.
Having developed his product, Deas needed capital investment. With the
aid of a SMART award from the Scottish Office, he had been able to
finance the development stage. To organise production on the massive
scale he knew was necessary -- the world market for properly functioning
memory devices is worth $20bn a year and, he says, there is even a
futures market in SIMM modules -- he went to California and within six
weeks raised $1.5m with another $1.5m to follow.
He then launched Memory on the UK 4.2 market and raised more.
Approximately 90% of the company is now owned equally by Deas, fellow
director Cameron McColl and 2M Invest, a Danish investment company,
while 10% is publicly quoted equity.
It is now at the production stage of its VCMs. And like its
Californian models, it is looking worldwide for their manufacture and
sale. Meanwhile, back in Dalkeith, Memory's design, engineering and
logistics team is creating real wealth for Scotland, as well as
examining the potential of other trailblazing products which will bring
yet more prosperity for the future.

THE numbers 1314 are engraved on most Scots' minds as the date when
Robert the Bruce defeated the English at Bannockburn. Advertising boss
John Morgan capitalised on this fact when he arranged a freephone number
for the Loch Lomond, Stirling and Trossachs Tourist Board's latest
advertising campaign.
The result is that cinema audiences throughout the UK will see the
number 0800 1314 13 appear on their screens at the end of a 60-second
commercial promoting the area.
They are unlikely to forget the rest of the commercial either, as it
will feature Hollywood heart throb Mel Gibson in clips from Braveheart,
his newly released blockbuster about the life and times of William
Wallace.
The Morgan Partnership must be congratulated for cashing in on the
film, part of which was shot around Stirling where Wallace won his
famous battle, and for coming up with such an unforgettable, at least
for Scots, telephone number.
It is not surprising that Morgan should be so astute when it comes to
putting Scotland's history to commercial use. Two years ago he launched
a Nigel Tranter Bannockburn chess set which includes William Wallace and
Edward I, even though neither was around at the time of Bannockburn,
proving that it is not only Hollywood which does not insist on
historical accuracy.
Morgan explained to Business Diary: ''Nigel and I agreed that William
Wallace and Edward I played such an important part in Scottish history
that they should be included in the set.''
His Cornerstone Gallery recently moved from Dunblane to Stirling,
where it is now situated near the castle. Customers can pick up one of
the limited edition Bannockburn chess sets for a mere #1350.
Morgan believes the cinema commercial with its unforgettable number
will be a big success, and together we mused that perhaps the English
Tourist Board would carry out a similar exercise with its equally
memorable date of 1066. But of course the English were defeated at the
Battle of Hastings, although this did not prevent them issuing a
commemorative stamp depicting the event.
At this point in the discussion a nameless spoilsport suggested that
the English might use 1745.
Dramatic display
draws crowds
THE Morgan Partnership is not the only commercial concern to take
advantage of the release of Braveheart. Kiltmaker Hector Russell is
attracting crowds to its shop window display in Princes Street,
Edinburgh, which features costumes and weapons used by actors and extras
during the film's making.
Michael Cantlay, chairman of Hector Russell, already has one of the
kilts worn by Liam Neeson during the filming of Rob Roy on show at his
kilt exhibition in the company's Inverness premises.
He must be delighted at the upsurge in interest for all things
Scottish, and he will also be delighted at being appointed deputy
chairman of Forth Valley Enterprise earlier this week. Congratulations.
Start the day
the English way
WHILE on all things Scottish -- or not as the case may be, Glasgow
Chamber of Commerce is holding a breakfast seminar later this month.
The venue is the city's Town House Hotel on Wednesday, September 27,
and the business begins at 7.50am with a full English breakfast.
One explanation could be that the seminar is a joint affair with the
banking industry to discuss electronic business payments, so perhaps the
breakfast is being sponsored by the Bank of England!
Award gets its
just rewards
THIS is a difficult Business Diary entry to write as it is almost
impossible to stop repeating myself.
Yet it is a simple story, its purpose being to record the fact that
Award plc, the Livingston-based manufacturer of daily disposable contact
lenses, has just picked up another award, the British Coal Enterprise
Start Up of the Year Award. You can see what I mean. We already have
three awards in one sentence, and I have yet to mention the fact that
this is the fourth award which Award plc has won in the past year.
The other awards were the Logie Baird Award for Innovation in
September 1994, the Ernst &amp; Young Trailblazer Award for January 1995,
and the Grant Thornton Eureka Award in August 1995.
Bricks and mortar
take to the air
THE population of Renfrewshire will be gazing skywards for much of
this weekend as a giant red, white and blue balloon soars over the
county.
The colours might encourage some people to believe that it is Rangers'
chairman David Murray heading for Ibrox with another transfer signing,
but in fact the balloon is taking to the air to mark the opening of
Taywood Homes' new development at Linning Gate, Crosslee.
The 80 foot balloon is the creation of Scot Don Cameron, the first man
to cross the Sahara, and later the Alps, by hot air balloon. Cameron,
who is an aeronautical graduate of the University of Glasgow, now runs
the world's largest balloon manufacturing business from factories in
Bristol and the US.
Despite the impressive sight of his creation gliding silently through
the skies, Taywood will be hoping that some people avert their eyes and
concentrate on the ground, at least for long enough to take a look at
its new homes.
Strange tales
of Euro logic
WITH the after dinner speaking season fast approaching, practitioners
of this art who are members of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce may find it
worth their while to ask the chamber for a free copy of the booklet
European Community: Facts and Fairytales Revisited.
The 20-page publication is a fund of potential after dinner jokes. It
lists a series of Euromyths including the one that Brussels intended to
''harmonise'' Christmas. This particular story came about, according to
the Foreign Office, because several national daily papers, not including
this one, could not resist the obvious pun when Jacques Santer came on
the scene.
The booklet also pours cold water on the suggestion that the size of
condoms would be set by the European Union. This came about, we are
informed, because the Commission did request that CEN, the European
standards body, come up with a set of European safety standards. We are,
however, assured that these are more concerned with the quality of the
condom than its size.
The booklet states: ''The standards were never intended to be
compulsory -- it is for Member States to decide what to do about them.''
So is it true then that the EU rules define snails as ''land-based
fish'' so that mollusc farmers can get easier access to its funding?
''Nonsense,'' says the Foreign Office. ''This myth stems from
unsuccessful attempts by the French to have snails and frogs included in
the ''aquaculture'' sector. Nice try.
Ups and downs
of flying visit
IT seems that Strathclyde Region's deputy leader Gerald McGrath had
one of those up in the air days earlier this week when he was due to
open Centura House, a new office development at Hillington near Glasgow
at 12pm.
The day began badly when his 8.30am Air UK flight from Gatwick to
Glasgow was cancelled. There were no alternative flights to Glasgow but
eventually he secured a seat on one to Edinburgh instead.
He arrived at Hillington rather flustered just in time to discover
that developer Paul Green wanted him to go 60 feet up in the air again,
this time in a maintenance hoist.
Having survived this trauma, he was then asked to make a prize draw
but bit his tongue when he discovered that the prize was a trip to
Amsterdam -- courtesy of Air UK! However, the winner Ken McInnes of
Ryden was delighted.
International
meeting of minds
TV presenter Joan Bakewell will chair the Inter-Governmental
Conference from a Regional Perspective at the Edinburgh International
Conference Centre on November 17.
The conference is the brainchild of the East of Scotland European
Consortium which consists of the Fife, Tayside, Lothian and Central
regional authorities.
Organiser Meeting Makers expects around 180 delegates to attend the
conference which will be addressed by Monika Wulf-Mathies, European
Commissioner for Regional Policies. Other speakers will include North
Tayside MP Bill Walker and MEP David Martin.

<HEADLINE>Sparks fly as Norweb hits back at water takeover bid. Door is left open for other likely buyers</HEADLINE>

FROM an early age we are told that water and electricity are a
potentially lethal mixture, and sparks certainly flew yesterday when
North West Water launched its expected bid for Norweb, valuing the
regional electricity company (REC), which serves Manchester, at about
#1582m.
However, the bid was promptly rejected by Norweb because it
''undervalues Norweb on a stand-alone basis'', opening the way for other
potential bidders, including American utilities, to throw their hats
into the ring.
This latest bid brings to four the number made for privatised
electicity companies this year and is unlikley to be the last one.
North West Water's offer consists of 1834p in cash and two new North
West Water shares for every three Norweb, valuing each Norweb share at
about 1015p.
There is a full cash alternative of 975p per Norweb share. That
compares with the current price in the market of 1008p, up 33p. North
West Water shares rose 5p to 616p.
In order to fund the acquisition, North West Water is raising up to
#567m via a two-part rights issue underwritten by Kleinwort Benson.
The rights issue is on the basis of a maximum of two new North West
Water shares, at a price of 525p per share, for every seven currently in
issue.
The first instalment, which is approximately the equivalent of a one
for 14 rights issue, will raise about #140m. The second instalment is
conditional on the offer becoming unconditional and the cash cost of
financing the acquisition of Norweb exceeding #1085m.
The clamour for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission enquiry from both
sides of the House of Commons will act as dampener on the share price
until the regulatory and competition issues have been ironed out.
Although the electricty industry regulator, Professor Stephen
Littlechild, may be reluctant to intervene, he may insist that any
efficiency gains are passed on to customers rather than shareholders.
The UK water industry watchdog Ofwat and its electricity counterpart
Offer are to issue a consultative document on the bid next week.
Ofwat is known to be concerned about ring fencing of the utility
businesses of the two companies, and the clarity of accounting.
North West Water has already said that the proposed merger will
provide major benefits for customers.
Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of North West Water, dismissed fears
that the creation of Britain's first mixed utility giant would create a
giant monopoly holding customers to ransom.
''Any business that gets substantially more efficient must be better
for the consumer,'' he said, adding that price improvements would occur
by the year 2000 at the latest.
Higher levels of service have also been promised, building on the best
practices from both companies. The merged group would serve 2.8 million
water customers and 1.9 million electricity customers.
When companies mention increased efficiency and cost savings, as North
West Water has done, that invariably translates into job losses. Since
privatisation in 1990 all the utility companies have shed large numbers
of staff. In the case of the electricity companies this has averaged 13%
of their workforce.
No figure has yet been put on the likely level of job losses
accompanying any merger between Norweb and North West Water, although
Sir Desmond said there would be ''no sweeping cuts'', they are likely to
run into the hundreds.
Those most at risk are thought to be in head office functions. If the
bid is successful, the two existing corporate headquarters will be
merged. However, there are a number of services commmon to both groups
which could be rationalised following a merger. These include meter
reading, billing and collection, infrastructure works, key account
management and other support functions.
Despite tough new price controls imposed by the industry regulator in
the summer, regional electricty companies still present a number of
attractions for potential predators. These include a stable cash-flow
and minimal debt -- their average debt to equity ratio being just 15%.
The attractiveness of the RECs has been further heightened by their
stakes in the National Grid Company (NGC). It is expected to be sold off
before the end of the year for between #3000m and as much as #4500m.
REC shareholders also stand to benefit significantly from tax
advantages which would follow any sale of the NGC.
North West Water's offer has been structured to allow Norweb
shareholders to elect to receive, as part of the consideration, Grid
Exchangeable Bonds which will give them rights to shares in the National
Grid in the event of a listing of the National Grid on the London Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE>Japan cuts discount rate to 0.5%</HEADLINE>

SO languid is the Japanese economy, that the Bank of Japan has been
forced to cut its official discount rate from 1% to 0.5%, its lowest
level in history.
Official interest rates of just half a point are as low as most
analysts can recall anywhere in the world, though there was a period a
generation back when the Swiss effectively had negative interest rates
in place to stem the flow of money into Zurich.
Japan, which once sported trend growth of 4% a year, has been locked
in recession for most of this decade. A succession of fiscal packages
and interest rate cuts have failed to revive a flagging economy,
suffering from the strength of the yen.
Yesterday's cut in the discount rate, announced by Bank of Japan
Governor Yasuo Matsushita, was a surprise only in its timing. It had
been expected to follow rather than precede a fiscal package later this
month.
Lower rates should weaken the yen and help Japan's precarious banking
system undermined by mountains of bad debt inherited from the collapse
in asset prices.
But those who are predicting that the economy will at last stage a
recovery next year are not forecasting a return to the high growth rates
of earlier decades. Instead a pickup to around 2.5% is envisaged as the
economy struggles with the problems of maturity.
The Tokyo stock market took heart from the Bank of Japan's initiative.
The Nikkei Dow-Jones index hit a seven-month high with a jump of 658.37
points to 18,279.55, still less than half its all-time peak in December
1989.
The dollar was a major beneficiary and with intervention by the Bank
of Japan to sell yen for dollars it broke through the key 100-yen level,
last seen in January.
But there was no follow through by the Federal Reserve Board during
the European afternoon, and the dollar slipped back through 100.
Given the Bank of England's concerns about inflation, it is difficult
to see Britain being able to take advantage of the lower interest rate
environment, following cuts by the US, German, and Japanese authorities.
For much of the day the pound's trade weighted index was quoted at
85.1 on the back of the dollar's strength, but it slipped back to close
unchanged at 84.9.
At one point the pound was near DM2.30, but it fell back to close at
2.2927, a gain of 0.40 pfennigs. It lost 0.20 cents to $1.5488.

Scottish nationalism is confronting the divisions in Scottish society
and presenting a picture of a modern, pluralist nation of mixed
identities -- but some Scots will be offended, writes Peter Lynch.
NATIONAL identity in Scotland is a complex subject. The deceptively
simple question ''Who are the Scots?'' has no easy answer. However, it
is a fundamental question which nationalists have had to address for
over a century in their quest to mould the different elements of
Scottish national feeling into a coherent political force. The many
possible answers to the question merely illustrate the difficulties that
Scottish nationalism has with the objective reality of the Scottish
nation itself -- a problem which the SNP is seeking to deal with in the
1990s.
Scottish national identity can be viewed as a spectrum of views and
perceptions. At one end of the spectrum there is the late Nicky
Fairbairn's view of his own ancestry as constituting 1000 years of
ethnically pure Scottishness, untainted by the Irish, English, French,
or any other foreign influences. At the other end lies the reality of
the Scots as a mixed ethnic group containing substantial numbers of
different ethnic and national groups since Scotland began.
There are also a large number of alternative definitions between these
two views. The problem for Scottish nationalism has been to reconcile
these different perceptions and realities into a coherent ''nation'' and
present a form of civic nationalism that stresses the commonalities
between Scots rather than the differences.
One of Britain's foremost scholars of nationalism, Anthony Smith of
the London School of Economics, indentified six distinct elements to
national identity. A national group should have a collective name, a
myth of common ancestry, a fund of shared historical memories, elements
of common culture which differentiate the national group from other
groups, an association with a common homeland, and a sense of solidarity
as a nation. Each of these elements is present in Scotland in different
ways.
But what is clear is that there is no single factor that determines
Scottish national identity and that some of the factors which are
involved in the construction of Scottish national identity are actually
a cause of conflict within Scotland that undermines a common identity.
The fact that there has been no single transmitter of Scottish
national identity has been a substantial problem for the Scottish
National Party, faced with a fragmented and complex nation divided by
religious, ethnic and class differences. While other nationalist
movements were able to use language or cultural identity as the main
means of mobilising popular support, Scottish nationalism lacked a
similar mechanism to generate political support. Of course, such
mechanisms have often proved double-edged swords. In both Wales and the
Basque country language has played a substantial role in sustaining
minority nationalism, though it has also generated divisions that
nationalist movements have struggled to overcome.
The social and cultural barriers to Scottish nationalism are organised
around two distinct axes of identity.
* First, the dual identity of the Scots identified by John P
Mackintosh, through the sharing of Scottish and British identities.
* Secondly, the domestic divisions within the Scottish community which
elevate the differences between Scots. While the first dual identity
allows coexistence, through a shifting balance between those who feel
Scottish or British, the second is much more problematic as it turns on
definitions of Scottish national identity related to class, religion,
and ethnicity. In this category, the question ''Who are the Scots?''
raises anomalies and sources of division. Can Asian and English migrants
be regarded as Scots? Are the descendants of Irish Catholics Scottish in
the same way as longer-term residents brought up in Scotland's dominant
religious tradition? These are the thistles the SNP has been trying to
grasp in the 1990s.
Despite the secularisation of Scottish society in the twentieth
century, religion remains influential in shaping voting behaviour and
national identity, a situation which has presented considerable
challenges to Scottish nationalism.
Presbyterianism is the dominant religion in Scotland. It finds
expression through the established Church of Scotland and acts
consciously and unconsciously as a transmitter of national identity
within Scotland. The links between Presbyterianism and Scottish national
identity are problematic for non-adherents of the Church of Scotland. If
Presbyterianism is such a substantial component of national identity
then what place is there for Catholics, Jews, Muslims, and other
Protestant groups in Scotland?
The Scottish paradox is that the very institutions that are seen to
transmit a distinctive Scottish national identity, such as the Kirk,
legal system, and education system, have been perceived as socially and
politically exclusive to Scotland.
Writing in the 1980s, Tom Gallagher stressed that ''working-class
Catholics in particular find it difficult to relate to the symbols of
Scottish nationhood. The custodians of Scottish national identity have
tended to be bourgeois institutions like law, the Presbyterian religion
and education, and these are entirely alien entities to many
working-class Catholics.'' This situation has lessened in the 1990s,
with social mobility and the growth of a Catholic middle class, but such
negative perceptions of Scottish national identity, and by extension
also the SNP, remain prescient.
As the cases of religion and dual identity illustrate, Scottish
national identity contains a number of contradictions that act as
constraints on Scottish nationalism's ability to attract and mobilise
support of diverse groups in Scottish society.
The SNP has sought to deal with these contradictions in two ways.
Since 1992 the SNP has been acutely aware of the mixed ethnic background
of the Scottish population, and particularly the role of the English
community. This fact was brought into sharp relief with the appearance
of extreme anti-English groups such as Settler Watch and Scottish Watch.
Rather than quietly condemn the extremists and hope the issue went away,
the SNP developed a a constructive position that emphasised the positive
role of the New Scots in a modern Scotland based on citizenship rather
than ethnicity.
Similarly, when confronted by accusations of sectarianism after the
Monklands East by-election, the SNP did not climb into its shell. Its
leader, Alex Salmond, launched a series of speeches and initiatives to
stress the religious pluralism of the SNP and reach out to the Catholic
community.
Both of these initiatives sprang from political problems, but each is
achieving an objective that was not immediately apparent. In seeking to
deal with the complexities of national identity in contemporary Scotland
the SNP is actually redefining the nature and content of Scottish
identity itself. The SNP is attempting to mould together the
complexities of Scottish identity, particularly the ethnic and religious
aspects, into a contemporary and inclusive definition of Scotland and
Scottishness.
Scottish nationalism has seldom taken an ethnic interpretation of
Scottish identity. This is largely because the movement has been
predominantly pluralist and democratic, but also because it is extremely
difficult to present Scotland as an ethnic nation. Briefly in the 1950s
the SNP was confronted by a splinter group which was alienated from the
party leadership and sought to mobilise support outwith the SNP's ranks
using ethnic nationalism and an anti-English appeal. The individuals
involved quickly fell away and militant anti-English nationalism
disappeared until the creation of Settler Watch and Scottish Watch this
decade.
The new ethnic anti-English organisations that emerged after 1992 are
actually something of an aberration within a predominantly civic and
constitutional Scottish nationalism. Their appearance presented a strong
challenge to Scottish nationalism.
The SNP response was particularly high-profile. In part, this involved
damage limitation -- distancing the SNP from the new extremists. But the
response went beyond expulsions and the proscription of Settler Watch
and Scottish Watch. These negative actions were joined by a more
positive approach with the recognition of the role of New Scots in
Scottish society. The SNP organised a group of New Scots itself and has
included the concept into its literature and speeches, viewing Scotland
more as a mosaic and trying to project an inclusive image to appeal to
the New Scots as much as the old.
The concept of the New Scots is certainly in tune with the thrust of
political correctness, but should not suffer from this association. The
trendiness of the concept should not detract from the fact that it is
dealing with an objective reality -- namely the mixed ethnic background
of modern Scotland. The idea of the ''pure'' ethnic Scot has always been
an absurd one given the changing population of Scotland and the influx
of new groups and cultures over the centuries.
The absurdity is particularly clear in the late twentieth century when
the Scots-born and educated nature of many postwar Commonwealth
immigrants is taken into account. However, an awareness of the changing
composition of Scottish society is not the same as taking an inclusive
approach to turning diversity into a virtue. This political aspect is
what makes the SNP's approach to the New Scots phenomenon important.
Catholics, and specifically those of Irish origin, are of course the
oldest New Scots around and have the status of an ethnic as well as
religious minority in Scotland. The Catholic community in Scotland has
demonstrated a long-term political affiliation to the Labour Party,
indeed Labour has been an important mechanism for the integration of
Catholics into Scottish life.
Labour's hegemony over Catholic voters directly contrasts with the
traditionally weak nature of support for the SNP within the Catholic
community. Even when the SNP was at its electoral peak in the mid-1970s,
its support among Catholics was extremely low. However, this situation
has shown some signs of change, with Catholic voters showing some
propensity to switch from Labour to the SNP at the 1992 General
Election.
The nationalists have always had a problematic relationship with the
Catholic community. Some of the difficulty lies with the Presbyterian
components of Scottish national identity, an alternative identification
with Ireland among Catholics, and an insecure attitude to Scottish
self-government as a religious and ethnic minority in a Protestant
country.
Other difficulties are associated more directly with the SNP itself,
in terms of its Presbyterian image in large parts of Scotland
(especially in the West), the party's inability to confront the
religious issue head-on, and one-off problems such as the former SNP
leader Billy Wolfe's attack on the Pope's visit in 1982. The result of
these factors is that Catholics, and particularly Catholics of Irish
origin, are a section of the Scottish electorate that remains resistant
to contemporary Scottish nationalism and suspicious of the SNP.
Before the Monklands by-election, the SNP made some efforts to develop
links with Scottish Catholics. Jim Sillars and Alex Salmond both sought
to reach out to the Catholic community with reassuring messages of
support for Catholic schools. The fact that the SNP increased its level
of support among Catholics at the expense of Labour in 1992 was evidence
of the partial success of this approach. However, the aftermath of the
Monklands East by-election created the grounds for a more thorough and
explicit examination of the SNP's relations with the Catholic community.
The cynical would suggest that this was merely an attempt to gain
Catholic votes, but there is more to recent SNP initiatives than that.
After the dust of the Monklands by-election had settled, the SNP set
about examining its relationship with the Catholic community and the
community's relationship to Scotland and constitutional change.
This was intended to address negative perceptions that may have been
created among Catholics by Labour's accusation that the SNP had played
the Orange card at Monklands -- an accusation which may have been
intended to shore up Labour support among West of Scotland Catholics.
Since Monklands, Salmond has taken a high-profile approach to address
Catholics' negative perceptions of the SNP, aided by an informal group
of Catholics within the SNP. A speech to SNP conference in September
1994, a number of TV appearances and statements, columns in the Scottish
Catholic press, and the recent Williamson Lecture at the University of
Stirling have all focused on presenting a reassuring message to the
Catholic community.
But -- similar to the situation of the New Scots -- the messages go to
the heart of the contradictions of Scottish identity itself. Rather than
remain burdened with the exclusive images of the past and disregard the
religious issue, the SNP is seeking to recast Scottish identity in a
more inclusive direction in tandem with the process of constitutional
change.
The issues of nationalism and identity have been in serious focus in
the past month or so, as a result of the efforts of the SNP to redefine
the Scottish nation and Conservative attempts to focus on extreme
nationalism at the Perth and Kinross by-election.
The latter example is deeply ironic. Here were the proponents of an
exclusive British national identity with a ''fortress Britain'' attitude
to Europe, immigration and citizenship, seeking to paint the SNP as
aggressive and exclusive at the time when Scottish nationalism was at
its most open and pluralist in redefining the nature of Scottish
national identity and citizenship.
There are of course many who still cling to the older, more exclusive
views of Scotland. To them, the SNP's efforts to redefine Scottish
national identity are anathema -- a fact which makes the process risky.
Some Scots will be offended by the SNP's attempts to include Irish
Catholics, Asians, and English migrants within a broad definition of
Scottish identity -- some will continue to maintain that Scotland is a
Protestant country with its clear subtext that Catholics and Irish are
not welcome. Contemporary Scottish nationalism seems to be setting
itself up to challenge these alternative definitions of Scotland in
addition to promoting independence.
The fact that Scottish nationalism is confident enough to confront the
divisions in Scottish society and present a picture of a modern,
pluralist Scotland of mixed identities, demonstrates both its political
maturity and determination to address contemporary reality rather than
any romantic visions of the past.

IT SEEMED a simple request. ''Could I speak, please, to Doctor X?''
''Who's calling?''
So you give your name and the title of the newspaper.
''Hold on please,'' the singsong voice chirrups, ''I'll have to
transfer you to the person who deals with press inquiries.'' Ho hum.
A frenzied burst of some tinny tune that might once have had the same
relation to music as Will Carling has to humility; click, click. A
clipped voice bites on the word Yes?
''May I speak, please, to Doctor X?'' This is becoming wearily
repetitive. But, patience, patience; it's important.
Why do I want to speak to him? Listen you stupid pratt, it's none of
your business, just see if he's available. No, you're right, I didn't
say that. I just wanted to, very very much.
So, deep breath, very deep breath: ''Because I'm researching an
article on a dangerous form of food poisoning that's increasingly
infecting and more often killing Scottish children and Doctor X is the
man with the information I need. So I would like to speak to him,
please.''
The tone is brisk: ''Write down your questions, send them on the fax,
and I'll pass them to him.''
What? ''But hang on, I want to speak to him, is he available?'' I may
be beginning to babble. She's beginning to sound like a recorded
message.
''You will have to put your questions in writ . . .''
''No I won't. I want to hold a conversation with the man. If he's
available, will he speak to me? If not, could he call me back?''
There's an Arctic sigh gusting down the line: ''Give me your name and
your number. I can't say when he will get back to you.''
He didn't.
That some 10 minutes later I was speaking to an eminent professor,
working on the same research in another hospital oddly bereft of the
services of a press officer is really neither here nor there. Still, his
secretary took a message and said he would ring back. He did.
This dreary little tale is not intended to make trouble for the
impudent twerp from a Glasgow health trust, tempting though it is. I
fully appreciate she was probably operating from official instructions
set down in some lavish 1479-page gilt-edged, four volume, press and
media relations handbook produced at no more than the cost of three
tonsillectomies and a couple of new hospital wards.
No, that the spin doctors, bumbling, amateurish, clueless as they
sometimes are, have taken over the asylum, is axiomatic.
What is infinitely more dispiriting is the frustrating reminder that
the the words ''democratically'' and ''accountable'' are now no more
than the kind of hot air that spumes from the mouths, arc-welded into
smiles, of those employed to obstruct the flow of information to which
we ought to be entitled.
That section of public life which defines freedom of information as
the freedom to preserve its own interests ensures that the words
''local'' and ''democracy'' now involve the same cynical obfuscation of
meaning that happens when we call military armaments peacekeeping
equipment or sacking people rationalisation.
Our political culture has revived the secretive executive, the
unelected wielders of power, and nowhere more obviously than in the
health trusts. It's not Big Brother we worry about -- much -- any more.
It's his bastard cousin King Quango.
There is a wider issue here. It's something that Andrew Marr, the
political journalist, touches on in his new book Ruling Britannia: The
Failure and Future of British Democracy. Any healthy politicial
community has to have not only the mechanisms to argue with itself
intelligently but also clear lines of accountability. Newsnight and
Today are no substitute for a political forum with real power that
connects politicians with the electorate.
Similarly, then, press officers and media relations officers and
directors of information are no substitute for direct access to those
who make the decisions and wield the powers that cut deep into our
lives.
All the shiny happy people ostensibly employed to provide a flow of
information merely act as a barrier to the dissemination of that
information, and a screen behind which those who wield power may lurk.
Despite all those facial hernias suffered by Ministers feigning
sincerity about the need for more open, more accessible government it
cannot happen when almost 20% of public expenditure is spent by
unelected quangos over which ministerial control is the most diaphanous
of pretences.
Fear of being found out seems now to be one of the great motivations
of modern society. The secrecy that flows from that is a flaw so deeply
imbedded in our culture that it corrodes the integrity of public life.

SHE was more than annoyed; she was harassed in a way that only an
imminent live TV broadcast can make you. Ford and I had just been
awarded a Fringe First for our play, and being Scottish winners, STV
wanted to have a chat with us during the chummy bit at the end of the
lunchtime news.
After receiving the plaque on behalf of Castlemilk People's Theatre we
had a quick celebratory beer then headed down the Royal Mile as
scheduled. Having five minutes to spare, we felt that in the pressure
cooker of live broadcasting we were in good time. As her temper showed,
five minutes was not good enough.
The boys in the gallery quickly checked everyone's name, and after a
quick check that no-one's clothing registered on the Montford scale of
visual interference, it was time to go. The message came to start the
interview. These guys are full of bladder; it might be drivel, but at
least it's fluent drivel. If you weren't paying attention you might
imagine they were saying something of interest. No danger of that. They
weren't.
''Here in Edinburgh it's just going crazy! Tourists everywhere,
buskers all over the place, but Kelly-Marie's got some importance news
for us. Kelly-Marie . . .''
At this point Kelly-Marie swung into action. ''Thanks Gary. Here in
Edinburgh we do have some important news right enough, Gary. The Fringe
First awards for drama have just been announced and among the
international winners were a Scottish company, Castlemilk People's
Theatre, for the production of their new play, Don't Start Me . . .''
She then interviewed the two head honchos from the theatre company,
who each dutifully trotted out the ''this surely is a victory for all
the people of Castlemilk . . .'' routine. In the fashion of publicly
funded theatre, these guys presume to speak for people who have never
given them a mandate, merely because they're from the same area. It
would be like Pat Kane speaking on behalf of the people of Coatbridge.
The combination of the awards ceremony and the early afternoon beer
had made Kiernan a bit frisky, and he was muttering barely audible
comments in my direction throughout. I was already grinning inanely,
desperately trying not to laugh. It was our turn next.
Perhaps they had difficulty in spelling Ford's second name, perhaps
they had sussed that he wasn't in a pliable mood, but they ignored his
contribution as co-author and asked me what the play was about. After a
short explanation of the plot, I turned to Ford and asked if he had
anything to say. Never one to miss a chance, he dived in.
''Well, frankly, I must say that I'm a bit miffed that Viv Lumsden
isn't here.''
Kelly-Marie's face was an absolute picture, the look of bemusement and
shock. She should have moved on right away, but Kiernan continued: ''If
I'd known it was going to be you guys I wouldn't have bothered turning
up. Where is Viv? We love you Viv! Anyway, can we plug our own show?
Gilded Balloon, every day 8.15.''
Kelly-Marie flustered in, ''No, let's just stick with the show we're
talking about just now, er . . . Graeme, what do you think of the
significance of this award to the ordinary people of Castlemilk?''
Looking at the video, Kiernan's reaction was a Hardy-esque picture of
mock outrage. While the CPT representatives tried to be earnest about
the vista of dramatic opportunity surrounding Castlemilk, the viewing
public were treated to the sight of a short fat guy miming his
indignation, while a tall fat guy gave up the fight against his baser
nature and laughed like an idiot, bent over double with hilarity. Not to
be silent for too long, Kiernan then provided background chants to the
sincere soliloquies.
''Bring back Viv! We love you Viv!''
Soon it was back to the studio, but unfortunately, still no Viv. With
the cameras off, the link man laughed. I think he could see the funny
side of it, but Kelly-Marie was none too impressed. As we left, she
treated us like the poor ordinary members of the public we undoubtedly
are, and never said a thing to us. Tracey, from the theatre group, was
more forthright. Half joking, whole serious, she shouted after us,
''Thanks for blowing our careers, lads.''
This episode confirmed a few things. I know that technically this was
national TV, but the only person I knew who saw it was my next door
neighbour. TV ''people'' persist in trying to make us feel as if they're
doing us mere mortals a favour by showing our faces on TV. Why should we
be grateful? Just because our dials are shown on a couple of thousand TV
screens, most of which are either unwatched or unheeded?
I suspect the reason Kelly-Marie was so annoyed was that, in not
begging to be interviewed, we weren't acknowledging the importance of
the medium. Maybe it was her pride getting in the way. Really, though,
if everyone agreed to boycott daytime TV, and its false super-transitory
sort of fame, then these over-inflated egos would have no-one to talk to
but other similarly exaggerated egos. Who's going to watch that?
TV affects people in the strangest ways. Because people who work in it
have a notion that their duty is to inform, they assume a mandate to be
invasive. If they have nothing better to do they feel entitled to harass
those who have witnessed or have been part of a tragedy. Worse still,
something about the small screen always makes people look stupid.
Perhaps it's because on TV the interviewees can only perform up to the
standard of the interviewer.
TV interviewing is one of those things that is easy to do, but very
difficult to do well. Whether they're speaking to a cup-winning goal
scorer, or a recently bereaved relative, the easiest question in the
world is ''How do you feel?'' This is meaningless. In these situations,
how the subject feels is obvious in its nature, and unimaginable in its
scale, so why ask someone to attempt to articulate it?
On TV the one holding the microphone holds the power. If they ask a
question, and the subject can't respond adequately, the facial close-up
of the stammering interviewee leads the casual viewer (and for daytime
TV, all the viewers are casual) to assume that the problem is the
inarticulacy of the subject, rather than the vacuity of the interviewer.
We got out of the tattooed madness of Edinburgh, and back to Glasgow's
relative sanity.
At the end of the STV six o'clock news they mentioned the awards,
showed excerpts from the play, and interviewed the two stars, Pat and
Stephen. Did they even mention us? Not once. Not once. It was a struggle
to stop myself turning round to Ford and saying, ''Thanks for blowing my
career.''

On film sets he runs a short rein. It's the same in his private life
Clint Eastwood tells Douglas Thompson about his new film, The Bridges
of Madison County, and talks about his life as a sexual cowboy and
mystery man
THE look today is of a distinguished Californian businessman of a
certain age. The grey-dominated jacket matches his swept-back hair, the
white shirt is given some personality by a restrained New Man-style tie
but the look and attitude tell you immediately that Clint Eastwood still
retains what he has always called ''the edge''.
At 65, the icon image and that uncanny instinct are preserved. When
you are close up with him you witness he's stared down the calendar as
much as he has all those movie gunmen. Of course, the lines are there
but the etchings of time apart from around the eyes which have squinted
into the sun and cameras for decades are not severe. It's a face that's
made many road trips.
And stops.
He's tall and the body is daily work-out muscled and lean and, as
always, this morning in the suite of a Beverly Hills hotel he is
charming. Charm, of course, can be or bring trouble. Especially when you
are Hollywood's richest and arguably most popular screen superstar.
Grandfather Eastwood likes the ladies. A great deal. Now he finds
himself embroiled not so much in a love triangle but with a penthouse of
personal problems. He's relaxed about it: ''As the great Jimmy Durante
used to say -- 'everybody wants to get into the act'.''
The strong, silent man of the movies has in the past decade been
acclaimed as one of the century's greatest film-makers, won a couple of
fistfuls of Oscars, made tens of millions of dollars, been revealed to
have a ''secret'' daughter from a long time ago affair and kicked out
one lover for another. Because of the mistress exchange he found himself
the recipient of multi-million dollar lawsuits and a brand new baby
daughter who will be two-years-old in July.
Now, lover No 2 has gone. And he has been romantically linked with
fellow Oscar-winner Meryl Streep who co-stars with him in the film
version of the publishing phenomenon The Bridges of Madison County.
The movie, based on Robert James Waller's bestseller -- for once that
is totally accurate for it has sold more than 10 million copies -- was
made minus much of what Eastwood calls the author's ''prosey'' style.
Known in Hollywood circles as ''the worst book in living memory'' it has
nevertheless been turned by Eastwood into a critically (in America)
accepted film. It is also making money.
The story of the four-day romance between Eastwood's magazine
photographer Robert Kincaid and Streep's Iowa housewife brought some
anguish to middle-America for sympathising with, while not endorsing,
adultery.
The book apparently had American men romancing their wives with
candle-light dinners and sharing showers and readings from the book to
invigorate their marital lives.
This would not appear to be Eastwood country. He disagrees. When it
involves women and loving he has always been an enigma. He is a sexual
cowboy but also a mystery man. His choice of women has never appeared to
be based on looks or intellect. And The Bridges of Madison County was
not strong on either. After Steven Spielberg won the rights to the book
it was Eastwood who stepped in as director and star -- Flirty Harry. He
was the one who wanted Meryl Streep to be his screen lover: ''I think
she's sexy.''
Nearly two decades ago he had similar thoughts about 28-year-old
Sondra Locke. He cast the waifish, green-eyed rather daffy-looking
actress in his Western The Outlaw Josey Wales in 1976. For the next 10
years they were -- to outsiders -- considerably happy. Along the way his
only wife, the former model Maggie Johnson, had been a childhood
sweetheart and he divorced. She received a financial settlement which
added up to nearly $50m. Part of the cash agreement was that she
received $1m for every year of their marriage -- $25m.
He remains close with their children, Alison, who is now a Paris
model, and Kyle, a musician who has a cameo spot in Madison County.
His relationship with Sondra Locke is more terse. By the mid-1980s
their longtime affair was in trouble. By 1988 Eastwood had clearly had
enough. While filming Pink Cadillac that year professional gossips said
he had apparently fallen for his co-star, the statuesque Bernadette
Peters.
Others knew better. Eastwood's interest was taken by red-haired
Frances Fisher who 23 months ago gave birth to their daughter Francesca
-- Streep's character in Madison County is Francesca Johnson -- but with
whom Eastwood has now broken up. A former partner in Eastwood's Hog's
Breath Pub in the California seaside resort of Carmel which he ruled as
mayor for three years says Eastwood liked small or slight women. Paul
Lippman said: ''He called them 'squirts' or 'spinners' or 'shrimps'.
Sondra Locke was no shrinking shellfish. After she was forced out of
the Bel-Air home they shared in 1989 -- Eastwood had the locks changed
and her belongings put in storage -- she tried to make a settlement with
her lover of more than a decade. She asked for $1.3m in payments over
seven years and two properties in the Los Angeles area.
He refused. She retaliated with a $70m ''palimony'' lawsuit. He
adamantly refused to give in to the lawsuit. He would defend it all the
way. But finally his lawyers' advice and pragmatism made him move away
from that attitude. At least legally.
He had been associated with Warner Brothers Studios for more than 20
years. His settlement with her would be a $1.5m payment and a three-year
film production and directing deal with Warner. She rescinded her
palimony claims and she was paid her up-front money.
She didn't know that Eastwood was underwriting the Warner deal with
part of his salary from his Oscar bonanza film Unforgiven. He says he is
on his own at present -- ''taking it easy'' is his stock answer to the
love affair questions -- but having directed and starred in the romantic
movie of the year, an in-build success story because of the popularity
of Waller's book, he is willing to talk about love and life and vice
versa.
He does not know the future of his relationship with Frances Fisher
although adds: ''We're extremely good friends.''
What about settling the Meryl Streep stories? Was it just the
publicity department trying to promote ticket sales for having them a
couple off as well as on screen?
He smiles: ''Well, the genders are definitely different.''
Streep has Eastwood as a fan. He says he's talking in a professional
manner but there is no disguising the fondness he has for her: ''I think
she is one of our finest actresses. I think she was the perfect age for
our film. She looks great.''
As Kincaid, the short-term but long-remembered lover of Streep's
Italian-descended housewife, he arrives into town unannounced. A
National Geographic photographer, he is there to film the covered
bridges of Madison County.
Eastwood knew his man: ''I identified with him. I could see the
character. I used to travel around in a pick-up truck scouting locations
over the years. Pick-up truck? You know what I mean.
''I identified with him. I think what they found was love because I
don't think either of them were searching for it.They had a certain
camaraderie. They became friends first, then slightly intrigued with one
another, and finally sexually attracted.
''That's the way it has been in my life.
''But there's definitely not enough passion or romance in the world.''
In The Bridges of Madison County the long weekend affair takes place
while Francesca's husband and children are away from home. Will it make
men paranoid that tall strangers are going to wander into town and
seduce their wives?
''Regardless of gender I would hope that the film makes people not
take their partners for granted so much.''
Sondra Locke became ''Clint's girl'' and Frances Fisher, who appeared
with him in Unforgiven, became the mother of his most recent child.
Until 1991 no one had heard of Roxanne Tunis who had small roles in
Eastwood's Rawhide television series which began in 1959. Their daughter
Kimber was born in 1964 and, by arrangement, kept quiet.
Four years ago his illegitimate daughter from all these years ago took
the name Kimber Eastwood and talked about her father. Later she claimed
Eastwood, who had kept in touch with financial and emotional support,
broke off contact.
It was a reaction to a man who always wants control. On film sets he
runs a short rein. It's the same in his private life.
Frances Fisher and he are living apart. There are specific
arrangements between them for the upbringing of their daughter
Francesca. What specifically they are remains private. It is part of the
arrangement -- much like Eastwood's arrangement all these years ago with
Roxanne Tunis.
Of course, times have changed and they can be open about it without
the stigma of three decades ago.
Sondra Locke understands her rival's feelings: ''The total control men
like him exert can be terrifying. Women get sucked into it because they
want to please but it's dangerous for there is no compromise with
absolute power.
''Clint has been both my lover and the father I was never really
really close to as a child. I was too dependent. Love, to me, meant
absolute trust. I gave Clint my all holding nothing back and demanding
nothing.
'It's a feminine failing. I thought Clint and I would be together for
ever and then suddenly it was all over. I was devastated. I thought I'd
been annihilated. I'd put so much of my life into this man's hands and
suddenly it was gone.
'I was in the Twilight Zone.'
She remains in legal limbo.
Eastwood Vs Locke continues.
So does Eastwood Vs Love and Commitment.
Which gets resolved first is the puzzle.
* Clint Eastwood talks to Melvin Bragg on The South Bank Show on
Scottish at 10.45 tomorrow and Barry Norman reviews The Bridges of
Madison County in Film 95 at 11.30 on Tuesday.

SIOBHAN SINNOT approached her Highland coach tour in the company of
American and Canadian tourists with some understandable misgivings. But
the kitsch of souvenir ducks in kilts was laughingly dismissed as much
by her fellow travellers as herself with a charming independence of
spirit. They made their own explorations and revelled as individuals in
their ''damn good holiday''.
Their responses were refreshing and very funny -- a
nicely-off-the-wall French Canadian visiting a distillery giggled her
way through her first malt whisky at 10 o'clock in the morning, through
which she described her expectations of Scottish malehood: a guy who
lives in a world of ''aunted ouses'', shortbread cookies, and sings
Flower of Scotland between mouthfuls of haggis.
As it turned out Sinnot learned that it was the sheep who were the
unsung heroes of Scottish tourism and the coach driver, David from
Hawick, had become an expert in dealing with detailed questions
regarding them.
Though it can be easily sent up, the need to search for, or to return
to one's roots, is a genuine human yearning for connections back. A
soft-spoken chap from the southern states had done his research and
dreamed for years of visiting Urquhart Castle, where there was a
Cummings connection. It could have seemed risible, but it didn't in the
least and his quest was enjoyed and shared by the rest of the company,
as the John Cummings pilgrimage was taken up by the whole bus. The man
was moved to tears and a woman softly told him to enjoy it and to take
the memory back.
The success of the programme Scotland The Tour (R4) was that while
mocking the air freshener in the shape of bagpipes and the tartan boxer
shorts, there was no snidery, no preconceptions about vulgar tourists
trails -- just a feel-good sense of a shared adventure.
On Radio Scotland's Movies and Shakers Sinnot embarked on a different
exploration of Scotland's image when she interviewed Mel Gibson, the
director and star of Braveheart. Declaring himself to be pretty
unworried about historical accuracy, Mel plugged the Hollywood
universality of the film and couldn't really understand why his
interviewer suggested that a valid interpretation of anti-Englishness
might be made.
Seems that in the interview Mel wore more make-up than Siobhan did --
she told the country this on TGIF before the broadcast interview. And he
was vastly better lit. I suppose it's to be expected that the film
star's notion of illumination will always be different from the
historian's.
Have just found out from BBC publicity department that TGIF stands for
Thank God It's Friday. Some asking around had to be done in case it was
Thank Goodness, and I was nervous about being accused of inaccurate
blasphemy.
Listening to the excellent start of the Women of the World series
would make any woman seriously nervous. The programme was called
Fertility -- the Pope and Deng Xiao-Ping and dealt with the horrific
ironies surrounding contraception and abortion in our
contradiction-crammed planet.
The Chinese Government's one-child policy justifies itself in terms of
sensible population control in a struggling, poor, and over-populated
nation. But the facts belie the rationalisations. Couples who have more
than the prescribed number of children are punished by fines, enforced
sterilisation, removal of their goods, sackings, and sometimes the
demolishment of their homes.
Meanwhile in Poland theocracy rules and in 1993 abortion was outlawed.
The pressure and suffering remains appalling. In the early 1990s village
priests were buying up with church funds all available contraceptives
and children were not able to make their first holy communion because of
their parent's pro-contraception beliefs. Some Solidarity with the lambs
of God . . .

* IS the relationship on the rocks? No, silly, not Liz Taylor's but a
far more important Hollywood liaison. A money one. The long-time
partnership of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer who were the most
successful film producers of the 1980s seems to be over.
The aggressive team who had hits like Flashdance, Beverley Hills Cop
(one and two) and Top Gun -- movies which collectively earned around
$1.5 billion -- are having what is politely called ''creative
differences''. They've had them before and got things straight.
But it seems more of a feud even with them having a blockbuster 1995
with huge hits including Bad Boys, Crimson Tide, and Michelle Pfeiffer's
Dangerous Minds which also created the present number one soundtrack
album in America.
Gossip has always surrounded Simpson's lifestyle and the discovery of
a dead body in the pool house of his Bel-Air home has started all sorts
of inquiries. And questions. One of the first was why private eye
Anthony ''The Pelican'' Pellicano was called in. ''The Pelican'' is
known as a ''crisis PR'' for Hollywood and was a familiar figure during
Michael Jackson's sad summer of child abuse allegations. Now he is
acting as the mouthpiece for Simpson.
He just isn't saying a lot.
Pellicano insists the discovery of the body of Dr Stephen Ammerman,
44, who police suggest died from a drug overdose on Simpson's property,
has nothing to do with the rift between the movie automakers.
But sources insist that Bruckheimer, a tall, lanky, good-natured
health freak, is insisting that his partner in so many major movies get
his personal act together. He's also said to be angered by having to
oversee most of the Gene Hackman/Denzel Washington submarine thriller
Crimson Tide on his own. Simpson has admitted that he never spent even
one day on the set of what was one of this summer's biggest box office
films.
Clearly, because of their superlative track record, official Hollywood
is not saying much other than platitudes. The dollar is, as always, the
bottom line and Simpson and Bruckheimer bring in zillions of them. Joe
Roth is the chairman of Walt Disney Pictures -- the studio where the
boys have their splendid offices -- and all he would say is: ''I think
they are terrific producers.''
* GOLDIE HAWN, who is skirting around her fiftieth birthday -- and
it's usually a short skirt -- was so enamoured by recent pictures of
herself that she's decided after a two-year lay-off to get back on
screen. She is in Woody Allen's next film -- as always, it has no title
so far -- and then will jiggle on to the First Wives Club co-starring
with Bette Midler and Diane Keaton.
* IRAN-CONTRA ''hero'' Oliver North is about to be seen on American
television guest-starring in Jag -- a 60-minute adventure series
starring David James Elliott. Don Bellisario, who produced Magnum PI and
Quantum Leap, says it is just the beginning of gimmick casting. Will
White House possibility Colin Powell be next?
* Mr MUSCLES Arnold Schwarzenegger has finally got a leading lady for
his next action movie Eraser. The one-time Mr Universe has scored Miss
America -- Vanessa Williams. Williams lost her title because she posed
nude for a magazine. Arnold did the same early in his career but hung on
to all his titles.
* ANJELICA HUSTON, who won an Oscar for Prizzi's Honour -- was
directed by her father and starred with her then lover Jack Nicholson --
has agreed to be the lead in the prequel Prizzi's Family.
* MELANIE GRIFFITH has signed to be in Lolita -- playing the baby
doll's mum which Shelley Winters did brilliantly in the original
adaptation of Nabokov which co-starred the late James Mason and Peter
Sellers -- but the producers are still looking for that special little
girl for the title role. Also signed is Jeremy Irons as the man who
lusts after lollipop girls.
* WITH Apollo 13 a huge hit in America and opening here in the next
couple of weeks, the naughty story from America is that the spacecraft
was carrying a nuclear device with 8.3 pounds of plutonium in its
excursion module. It was to be left on the moon to supply energy for
experiments.
It contained radio-active material so toxic that less than
one-millionth of a gram could give a person cancer. When astronauts had
to abort their mission they blasted back to Earth with the device in
their module. If the spaceship had exploded on re-entry there could have
been a nuclear doomsday. Instead, the nuclear device fell into the Tonga
Trench in the South Pacific. Hopefully, it was not disturbed by events
earlier this week.

Facing the music: Ian McShane casts aside his Lovejoy role to become a
DJ in a new drama which sets him off on an American quest
AT FIRST glance there does not appear to be anything particularly
Scottish about Soul Survivors (BBC1, Sunday), a highly superior two-part
comedy drama starring Ian McShane and -- a rare treat -- the legendary
soul star Isaac Hayes. But check out the end credits and you'll see that
it was directed by Sandy Johnson and produced by Martyn Auty.
Who they? Well, Sandy is the Scots film-maker who has just been lined
up as director of the forthcoming screen adaptation of Alasdair Gray's
novel Poor Boys. This ambitious feature film -- the most expensive
Scottish movie ever and one of the first projects to benefit from the
Scottish Arts Council Lottery Fund -- starts shooting in Glasgow later
this year. Auty, though English, has strong ties to Clydeside; he was
formerly the director of the Glasgow Film Theatre.
McShane plays Liverpool deejay Otis Cooke, a man who lives for the
sound of sweet soul music. Sacked by his soul-destroying radio station
at the age of 47 and with nothing much to lose, he sets out on a quest
to find his lost heroes -- Leroy, Vernon, Eddie, and Grover the four
black dudes who made up a US soul band called the Tallahassees, They
were ''four men who really understood the power of mohair'' but they
disappeared off the face of the Earth when their brand of music lost its
appeal in the 70s.
The deejay's dream is to get the group to reform. Which is fine in
theory but first he's got to track down the individual members. So off
he goes on a Cooke's tour of America. He finds Grover (played by former
Radio One deejay Al Matthews) playing piano in a topless bar; Eddie
(Taurean Blacque from Hill Street Blues) is working as a repo man;
Vernon (Isaac Hayes) has his own prestige PR company; and Leroy . . .
Well, Leroy is a bit of a problem on account of the fact that he was
supposed to have been shot to death three years ago when he was found in
bed with another man's wife.
Soul Survivors also stars Margi Clarke and Derrick O'Connor and
features a cracking soundtrack, with songs from soul stars like Wilson
Pickett and Aretha Franklin.
* MELVYN BRAGG may appear to be a smug, superior, know-it-all but,
give him his due, he does know how to handle a Hollywood superstar. He
has the gift of being able to ask the right questions; you know, the
ones which people want answered. And, unlike some interviewers, he
doesn't try to show off in front of big-shot celebrities.
He's back this week with the 19th season of LWT's flagship arts show,
The South Bank Show (ITV, Sunday), which opens with a scoop -- a rare
television interview from Clint Eastwood. Filmed in the star's home at
Carmel, it's a blatant plug for the Big Man's new movie, a corny
middle-aged romance called The Bridges of Madison County, which is
released in Britain later this month.
Still, thanks to Bragg's effortless style and expertise, Eastwood does
open up and provides some valuable insight into his long career. Looking
relaxed and at peace with himself, the ageing actor (he's now old enough
to pick up his pension) recalls his saddle days -- when he was a screen
cowboy, first in the TV series Rawhide and then as Sergio Leone's Man
With No Name No Pack Drill in the spaghetti Westerns of the sixties.
The programme goes on to discuss his transition to maverick San
Francisco cop in Don Seigel's Dirty Harry movies and how the gloriously
un-PC character (''I know what you're thinking, punk. Did he fire five
shots or did he fire six?'') became a hugely popular icon for a public
which, at the time, was more right-off than right-on. It is also worth
noting that Eastwood was the role model for stars like Bruce Willis and
Mel Gibson. He was the first action hero.
The accomplished Bragg manages to extract some interesting views from
the star. Though Eastwood's private life is never discussed (presumably
there was a ''no personal questions'' clause in the contract), he does
talk at length about his craft -- which, to be honest, is a damned sight
more interesting than who he's shacking up with.
He explains, for instance, how he learned to act sparingly, conveying
a message in a look -- he could stop a bad guy in his tracks just by
narrowing his eyes -- rather than in a stream of dialogue.
''You have to develop this inner life -- whatever it may be that's
driving the character on -- and then hopefully people believe you. They
don't have to hear every word. People go out there (to the pictures) for
a visual experience anyway. Maybe it's a sound experience as well, but
if they don't hear the words they make them up in their minds,'' he
says.
Eastwood also talks about the increasing importance of his work as a
director and how he learned from his mentors (Leone and Seigel) to
create this unique vision in his construction of shots, his use of
sound, and his choice of natural locations.
The nice thing about the South Bank Show is the fact that, while it's
essentially a serious arts programme, it doesn't take itself, well, too
seriously. Its secret is that it presses all the right buttons in the
popular culture control box (forthcoming editions will go from Pavarotti
to Jimmy Nail and from Peter Ackroyd to Tom Sharpe).
And so we cut to Rare Interview with Hollywood Superstar II -- The
Nightmare Continues. By coincidence, that other great
ageing-actor-director, Robert Redford, features in The Vision Thing
(Channel 4, Thursday). Like Eastwood, he takes the opportunity to
discuss his work on both sides of the camera.
Interviewer Sheena McDonald asks him about the importance of his
Sundance Institute, the body he founded in 1981 as a focal point for
independent film-making, and wonders whether its enormous success means
that it is in danger of being swallowed up by the Hollywood system,
thereby ceasing to become the radical alternative it was supposed to be.
Redford also gives his view on mainstream American cinema. On whether or
not it is in terminal decline as a mass medium.
Still on the subject of movies, that grossly under-rated actor Joe
Pesci turns up for a great double whammy this weekend. Tonight see the
first network showing of My Cousin Vinny (BBC1, Saturday), British
director Jonathan Lynn's culture-clash courtroom comedy. Pesci is
brilliant as the foul-mouthed, street-smart New York lawyer who comes to
the aid of his cousin, falsely accused of murder in a sleepy,
hicksville, Alabama town. And continuing the New York Stories movie
season, Howard Franklin's atmospheric biopic-cum-thriller The Public Eye
(BBC2, Sunday) stars Pesci as freelance photographer Leon Bernstein, a
character not a million miles away from the legendary 1940s
ambulance-chasing tabloid snapper, Weegee.

* IT is apparently the most expensive documentary series ever mounted
by the BBC; a television history lesson so vast and ambitious that we'll
only see 10 of the 26 episodes this year. People's Century (BBC1,
Wednesday) is a powerful chronicle of the turbulent changes of the
twentieth century -- but not taken from the usual pompous perspective of
historians and experts.
Rather the series paints its pictures from the views and recollections
of ordinary people who were there at the time. A woman who was caught up
in the Russian revolution; a man who was a victim of the Holocaust. In
this way we are presented with highly personal accounts of what it was
like to live through these moments of great importance. In short, it is
the ultimate eye-witness.
The series is complemented by some remarkable footage, much of it
never before seen, from film archives all over the world. The first
programme, 1900: Age of Hope, includes an interview with the oldest
contributor. South African Dorah Ramothibe, who was born in 1881,
recalls the terrible hardships of the black population which led to the
birth of the African National Congress.
Eva Hart, who was a passenger on the Titanic, recalls: ''Silence is a
great thing to me because I can remember this starlit night and these
shrieking, drowning, people. And then this silence which you couldn't
describe.''
People's Century tells the story of 100 years of rising hopes and
aspirations; of dreams betrayed and promises broken. It is a truly
remarkable documentary series.
* ITV continues its search for a decent sitcom with the start of Is It
Legal? (ITV, Tuesday) a new series from Simon Nye, the man who created
Men Behaving Badly and Frank Stubbs Presents. It stars Patrick Barlow
and Imelda Staunton as the senior partners in a chaotic suburban
lawyers' office where justice is seen, not so much to be done, more to
be miscarried. In the opening episode, Death in Hounslow, disaster-prone
Colin (Richard Lumsden) arrives fresh from law school as the latest
recruit to the practice and manages to accidentally kill his first
client.
Degrees of Error (BBC1, Wednesday) is a tense, murky, four-part
medical thriller which questions the links between medical research and
commercial profit. Beth Goddard (from Preston Front) plays young Dr Anna
Pearce who takes a job testing drugs in a hospital pathology lab.
In this week's opener she becomes suspicious of the work she's asked
to do -- injecting wee white rabbits with Thalidomide. In the process
she's forced to confront some rather nasty home truths, not only about
her work and the ethics of medicine, but also about her own family. Is
her strait-laced mother, whose behaviour is becoming violent and
erratic, suffering from a mental illness? Or could it be connected with
the tranquillizer drugs she has been prescribed by the family doc?
Even without Casualty (back next week) and ER (back later this year),
medicine continues to be a rich vein for the television dramatists. In
the second episode of Medics (ITV, Friday), now into its fifth series,
Dr Who . . . sorry, Professor Hoyt (Tom Baker) enrages his bosses by
organising a boycott of a local pay meeting.
A cancer patient believes his life's been ruined despite careful
screen grafting to his face by plastic surgeon Helen Lomax (the aptly
named Dinah Stabb). Meanwhile, health-care assistant Janice Thornton
(Susan McArdle) causes a disaster by giving a patient the wrong oxygen
mask. Fair makes you think twice about a visit to the infirmary.
The Tallahassees were four men who really understood the power of
mohair

THESE things are best left to Nick Hornby and his ilk, but it's a true
confession all the same: the first record this columnist ever bought was
I Get Around by the Beach Boys, a thing of wonder in 1964, from its
purple Capitol label, so hypnotically American, to the burnished vocals
layered in its shining grooves. Endless summer had not yet become a
cliche -- to an eight-year-old there is no such thing -- and the purity
of the moment survives, even three decades on. I have the record yet,
and there's still no surf worth the name in Portobello.
Scratched and battered as it is, the disc has worn better than its
creator. In the Omnibus portrait I Just Wasn't Made for These Times
(BBC1, Sunday) Brian Wilson sounded like a drunken stroke victim
displaying about as much insight into his condition as a butterfly does
with its wings pulled off. It was as though someone had just punched him
in the head: he seemed stunned, bewildered by his memories, sure he was
hurt but unable to report quite how it happened.
If you ever thought anything of Wilson and his music this film, by Don
Was, made for difficult viewing, the way wounded animals make for
difficult viewing. The beautiful voice was almost gone -- he knew where
the notes were, he just couldn't seem to reach them -- and the
experiences they represented, that stainless creativity, was like a name
he couldn't place.
Having an array of lesser talents rounded up just to recall how good
Wilson used to be only made it more painful.
Yet this, pitifully enough, was a man newly recovered from decades of
drugs, psychosis and failure, groping his way towards yet another
comeback (he's been ''better'' before) and trying to find the pieces of
himself in his music.
Due, no doubt, to the endless lawsuits which still separate him from
the rest of the band, only his brother Dennis participated. Equally,
none of the group's original recordings was used. Wilson and his studio
musicians strove manfully to reproduce the sound, but it was like trying
to guess at a Matisse from the frame alone.
Some airhead could not resist the temptation to compare the old
recordings with, like, one of those old classical dudes, as though
somehow to validate a music that was its own validation.
The observation, such as it was, missed every point about how pop
somehow manages both to fade and to endure. The most depressing thing
about I Just Wasn't Made for These Times was not that life has been hard
on Brian Wilson but that life was once so good to him. You left the
piece wishing him all the happiness he ever gave to others.
You left Frank Skinner (BBC1, Sunday) wondering what iron law of light
entertainment it is that demands this kind of show of talented
comedians. As a stand-up Skinner is matchless; as a sketch performer he
passes muster; but as a chat-show host, even as a comic chat-show host,
he's a waste of space.
The format, one gathers, is all. If it didn't work with Jonathan Ross,
and if it flopped like a Jumbo jet in an emergency landing with Danny
Baker, that is all the more reason, according to someone's weird logic,
to hitch Skinner's wagon to a well-flogged horse. The result was 10
minutes of very good stuff and an awful lot of hopeless guests.
That said, there are performers who do not flinch at tired formats.
Smith And Jones (BBC1, Wednesday) haven't changed the style of their
show in years and now resemble the closest thing TV still has to the Two
Ronnies, right down to the spoof news reports. Yet they remain, one or
two obvious parodies aside, among the funniest men on television, with
an eye for detail few possess.
Which other English comics, after a murderous assault on two mad
Scottish lighthouse keepers, would then apologise to Scottish viewers
who may have failed to follow the accents? How many would have the
simple nerve to spoof the Borrowers by showing the little people as the
baffled owners of a huge lump of hash?
Double-acts have the advantage over singles in the scope for
development they can claim. Once established, a solo act is imprisoned
in a persona that can quickly become, even with the best of them, little
more than a collection of mannerisms. Double-acts -- think how Morecambe
and Wise evolved -- grow, if they have the wit, through the changing
relationship between the partners. Acts like Cannon and Ball never
managed the trick but Smith and Jones, refusing to settle into the
straight-man/funnyman cliche, are in a league of their own.
Marcel Ophuls is another in a league of his own, but since he is
perhaps the only one playing there, this isn't much of a compliment.
Better to say that you won't come across a better example of the lone
documentarist's art than tonight's The Troubles We've Seen: Second
Journey (BBC2), the second part of his study of war correspondents.
Last week Ophuls pricked a few balloons -- the BBC's John Simpson
being an overinflated one -- while trying to investigate just how anyone
goes about covering something like the Bosnian crisis. Drawn by the faux
glamour of the foreign correspondent -- so close to the front-line, so
far from the truth -- he circled the proceedings like an agitated and
oddly-jolly gnome. It was fascinating stuff. If truth is the first
casualty of war, Ophuls is a stretcher-bearer.
Equally good (indeed compulsory viewing) if altogether more formal was
The Death of Yugoslavia: Enter Nationalism (BBC2, Sunday). Having taken
two years to persuade Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic to join the other five
presidents of former Yugoslavia in agreeing to participate, the series
(the first of five) produced a superb portrait of political opportunism,
spooling back the years to show how the former hard-line communist
transformed himself into a blood nationalist who cared only for the old
federation's preservation -- under Serb control.
What was so alarming about the piece, and what has been so alarming
throughout the war, is that Milosevic seemed to believe every phrase of
his own lunatic rhetoric. Even while henchmen past and present were
revealing how they had provoked each step of the crisis, the braying
little demagogue went on calmly denouncing everyone but himself.
Unlike most things on TV, it is not a story of which we can hear too
much.

THE new buzz word in local government -- decentralisation -- does not,
as yet, seem to be stirring up much public interest.
It seems a little strange too that it is a phrase which is being used
principally in connection with the reform of local government in
Scotland whereas the Tory Government is reluctant to apply a similar
rationale to devolving some of its powers and functions to the Scottish
people through a Scottish assembly.
The Secretary of State for Scotland has recently produced a booklet in
which he propagates so-called decentralisation.
The contents are, of course, primarily directed towards councillors
and officials of the new unitary authorities. They are gearing
themselves for the take-over from the existing regional and district
councils. It would be interesting to know, especially in the big cities,
what they are making of the Secretary of State's rather vague and
ill-defined notions about decentralisation.
There appears to be a move among some of the new authorities to set up
a multiplicity of area and local committees and to abandon the
traditional committee structure. All this is apparently to encourage
more participation by local communities.
My own view is that if decentralisation is carried to its logical
conclusion of every local community insisting on the right to organise
and administer its own local services such as education, social work and
housing, then the prospects for local government could be chaotic.
The Tory Government remains committed to the extension of private
enterprise and the tactic used in the breaking up of some of our
nationalised industries, as in the case of British Rail, could be
applied in local government.
Decentralisation could also be described as a reversion to the old
system of large and small burghs and small councils and a return to
parochialism.

ONCE again Clydebank College is grateful to Tom Shields for the free
publicity (September 1).
However, being both honest and modest, we cannot claim credit for the
notes of guidance on the equal opportunities monitoring form from which
he quoted. This is an inheritance from our former employers, Strathclyde
Regional Council, which is still used in several other colleges and,
presumably, across the whole of the region itself.
As the great flagship of local government sails inexorably towards its
Firth of Clyde equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle, it seems churlish to
inflict further indignity by jettisoning all such relics meantime.
Once Tom has learned to distinguish between application forms and
equal opportunities monitoring forms, he might even like to try
completing the former and we'll consider his application without
prejudice.
Until then, perhaps we really should continue to spell things out in
detail!

IN response to the article by Sam Galbraith, MP, and the letters from
Sarah Martin and James Kelly, there are several very important facts
which need to be put straight about care in the community for people who
have learning difficulties, such as the people who currently live in
Lennox Castle Hospital.
It is important to remember that the people concerned never made a
choice to live in the hospitals. The reason they are living there is
because of a lack of investment in community support services. What is
called the ''hospital closure programme'' is in fact a complex process
of re-investing money from the hospitals to the community so that the
necessary support can be put in place there.
Sam Galbraith says that he doubts whether the extra costs of care in
the community are being made available. If he looked at the plans for
community care for the people leaving Lennox Castle, for example, he
would see exactly how the care is to be paid for.
There is also the suggestion that for some people care in the
community is inappropriate.
Living as a part of the community, with the support you need to do
this, is a basic human right. It is not a sort of NHS prescription such
as this person should have a particular drug and this person should have
the chance to live outside an institution.
Already within Scotland and the UK there are people with the most
severe and complex disabilities living well-supported and successful
lives within the community. It is a well-known fact that the majority of
people with severe disabilities have always lived in the community and
have never been admitted to hospital.
The third fact that needs to be faced is that these so-called idyllic
''village communities'' are still institutions. They are still
segregated away from ordinary life and they are still places where no
regular member of society would consider wanting to live. They are
ghettos (with nice gardens) where people with disabilities are sent when
other people make the decisions for them.
It is true that there are some bad examples of care in the community
such as residential homes which run on institutional values and where
the people who live there have severely restricted lives. Sam Galbraith
is also right to point out the scandalous lack of national evaluation
into what sort of services people are actually getting in the community.
Calling community care a new credo as Sam Galbraith does is to write
it off as a passing fad. Community care is about the basic human right
to live life outside of a hospital ward.
I often wonder if all these advocates of institutional care would be
willing to spend so much as a week living on the wards themselves.

IT IS little wonder that the public are sometimes confused over the
issue of brain death, when The Herald's Law Correspondent makes it clear
that he too does not understand either the concept of brain death or its
legal position (September 8).
Brain-dead patients are already dead in both practice and law;
withdrawal of treatment is the only appropriate and humane course to
follow.
Perpetuation of the myth that a patient is still alive because a
mechanical ventilator is pumping air in and out of the lungs can only
serve to confuse the situation and cause further distress to recently
bereaved releatives.
The ''right to die'' and euthanasia is an entirely separate and
unconnected issue.

IS there no end to the iniquity of PC and its pernicious pervasive
effect on everyday life. One of the sillier words we have from the
politically correct movement is ''caregiver''. Instead of parents,
guardians, foster-parents, and orphanage staff, all of which told us
something about the person doing the looking-after, the PC commissars
have decreed that such words are sexist, racist, and judgmental.
So where did they go for the neutral word? Right to that repulsive
''caring'', which is still with us in spite of Dame Edna: ''You have no
talent, darling, and I say that in a very caring way''.
Now we have anonymous ''caregivers'' making sure the vulnerable are on
the right PC path.
The silliest thing about it is its opposite: a ''caretaker''. We have
to reassess this harmless person, who in the past has pottered about
with brooms and rubbish bins, tidying up after schoolchildren and
footballers.
Now, as the opposite of a caregiver, a ''caretaker'' is a nasty bit of
work indeed, who takes away whatever small comforts the helpless may
have garnered from life, and leaves them wandering the streets devoid of
care. Very ugly indeed.

SOME of your readers may wonder if the three days a week he devotes to
Railtrack business is enough to allow chairman Robert Horton full grasp
of the complexities of the job he has taken on.
He assures us that modernisation of the West Coast main line is to
proceed ''exactly as planned'' once orders for the new in-cab signalling
system have been placed at the end of this year.
Which plan was that again? And who was going to foot the bill for it?
Pie-in-the-sky plans for upgrading the West Coast main line have been
coming off the production line regularly for the past decade. Observers
have learned to treat them with very great caution.
Since the line was last upgraded some 20 years ago we have seen
journey times slip -- as indeed they have elsewhere in Scotland: even
Glasgow-Edinburgh now takes longer than it did a decade ago.
What is needed on the West Coast is a proper high-speed rail link of
the sort now common in France and under development in most other
countries in Europe.
Whatever Mr Horton is planning, given the barmy set-up ordained for
Britain's privatised railways, readers can be certain of one thing: we
will not get a true high-speed link to the South.
Indeed most informed observers doubt whether we will get anything at
all, beyond the publication of yet more glossy pie-in-the-sky.

HUBERT ANDREW might do well to seek out a 12-person boat, capable of
operating across to Cowal and break the monopoly he decries (September
2).
Indeed, considering that you can cycle to most places on Bute in less
than half an hour and the subsidised buses run almost empty much of the
time to the main areas of habitation, anyone crossing on an
''alternative'' ferry would find it hard to justify bringing a car on to
the island, let along building a bridge and major new road.
I myself tested the Cowal option, courtesy of a lift from a fisherman.
Crossing from Port Bannatyne to Toward Point, I then cycled to the
Western Ferries pier in under 40 minutes, and thence to Gourock station.
Alternatively I could have taken a taxi, or the less frequent bus, and
if an entrepreneur saw fit, car-parking similar to that at Wemyss Bay
would cater for the regular commuter.
Small ferries are relatively simpler to establish than the big
car-carrying ones which require extensive infrastructure, and those
desperate to get on or off Bute late into the evening would be unlikely
to quibble at a taxi ride to or from Dunoon.
It just needs someone to grasp the nettle -- anyone got a 12-person
boat that takes bikes, and can beach or pier load?

I WOULD like to comment on the article on the Beijing conference in
which your correspondent writes that ''the Holy See with . . . Islamic
nations . . . want to break a fragile consensus that emerged in Egypt,''
this being about abortion and contraception (September 7).
I am neither a Roman Catholic nor a Muslim. However, I did attend the
preparatory meeting for this conference in New York last March where
repeatedly the European Union, the USA, and other Western powers showed
themselves to be utterly dissatisfied with the Cairo consensus which,
contrary to popular belief, did not decree abortion to be a woman's
right.
In addition I have a colleague at present in Beijing who phoned me on
Monday to say that the European Union (with Britain's help) are the ones
wanting to alter the Cairo consensus.
As a further example I would cite the Council of Europe meeting on
February 9-11 called to discuss the Beijing conference where it was
urged that ''universalism'' should be expanded.
To achieve this they aim to limit the right of countries regarding
reservations to UN agreements. They also claimed that a country's
cultural and religious traditions (specifically included in the Cairo
document regarding abortion and population control) should be
overridden.
The European Union, apparently, supports this. At the meeting on
September 7 of the UN Health Working Group the Spanish delegate for the
European Union said: ''There is no room for ethics in medicine, no type
of religion or culture should have any influence on medicine which is
purely a service.''
This is the most blatant form of colonialism to come out of Europe for
many years. What right have we to force our ideas down the throats of
developing countries? What crass arrogance to try such a tactic.

I REFER to the excellent article by Kay Carmichael on the proposed
Centre for Independent Living in Glasgow (August 31). As chairperson of
the steering group working to establish the centre, may I give an update
on the state of play?
The funding from Strathclyde Social Work Department, for the first
part of the project, is now in place. We are now fine-tuning the
contractual agreements and are optimistic that this will be concluded
soon.
More funding is required to cover the other parts of the project and
we are pursuing vigorously these from other sources.
Premises for the centre have also been identified. A redundant factory
in Brook Street, Bridgeton, is currently being renovated to our
specification. It is our aim to provide a central point of excellence
where the real needs of disabled people in Glasgow will be met.
In addition the building will be an example of how easy and
inexpensive it can be to provide a barrier free environment for disabled
people once they are fully in control of the planning process. We are
delighted that the building company involved, Neilstra Ltd, have
responded so enthusiastically to our ideas and requirements.
Much has been achieved in a relatively short time. The excellent work
of the steering group members, all of whom, as Kay Carmichael pointed
out, are themselves disabled people, is astonishing. Yet this is just
the beginning and the centre will show how independent living services
controlled by disabled people can improve the quality of their lives,
while saving society a great deal of expense.
However, we do need more disabled people to come on board and be a
part of this magnificent project.

ABUSE is a funny word. It used to be interchangeable with misuse, but
now it has more sinister connotations. Sexual abuse is the modern
equivalent of witchcraft -- we all know it is wicked, but has it
happened? Can we prove it -- and what a terrible injustice to be falsely
accused of it? However, while such abuse grabs headlines, another kind
of abuse has been growing -- abuse of the elderly.
''Confronting elder abuse'' formed the topic of a conference on
Thursday at the City Chambers organised by a ''cohort'' (their word --
and I rather like it) of health service/social work and voluntary
agencies within Glasgow. The morning session was enough to send me away
a wiser but sadder man. It soon became clear that confronting the
problem and obeying the adage of Bishop Michael Hare-Duke, chairman of
that session and of Age Concern, to observe, understand, and alleviate
was not entirely straightforward.
It was summed up by a cynical joke told by a speaker. Two hospital
trust accountants were congratulating one another on the millions of
pounds they had saved by displacing elderly patients back into care in
the community. One of them added, ''We've saved enough to build a new
mental hospital for all the carers who've cracked under the strain.''
The cruelty of the joke lies in the truth behind it, namely that along
with the hidden horrors of elder abuse there is another hidden horror --
oppressed carers who cannot cope and who occasionally let themselves
down.
One 61-year-old woman was quoted who looked after her elderly mother,
who clearly had a sharp tongue and never said thank you for anything
that was done for her. Once in a blue moon the carer's sister would
arrive with a bunch of flowers and was treated like an angel visitant.
Another example was the presence of bruising in suspicious places,
consistent with physical abuse. But before jumping to the worst
conclusions the examining doctor would have to explore the possibility
that the bruising was caused by being lifted awkwardly by an untrained
carer who was possibly a pensioner themselves.
Nor was there a clear definition of exactly what constitutes abuse. As
the report of the conference in yesterday's Herald made clear, the
stereotypical victim was not a frail white-haired old lady being slapped
when she was incontinent. Abuse could be psychological (including verbal
abuse), or take place through neglect. In a tiny number of cases it was
sexual. Another form which was much more common -- and to a large extent
either undetected or unreported -- was financial abuse. This was often
by a close member of the family and ranged from purse robbing to the
systematic emptying of bank accounts.
Dr Paul Knight, a consultant geriatrician at Glasgow Royal Infirmary,
said the public perception of elder abuse ranged from sensationalised
accounts and creeping epidemics, to thinking that it was not a top
priority. His experience led him to a middle position, that it was more
common than realised.
The number of elderly people has continued to rise through the
twentieth century (a half million 75+ in 1901 was three million by 1981
and in the same period the number of 85+ increased tenfold). Compounded
by the proportionate fall in other population ages, and more recently by
the move to community and home-based care, it has created a huge and
hidden ''industry'' of elder care. The education officer of Alzheimer
Scotland informed us that in Britain it has been estimated that six
million people were providing voluntary care, one in four to the tune of
20 hours a week. It represents a value of between #11.5bn and #15bn
annually.
The shock statistic comes when the age range of these carers is
analysed. Half are between 40 and 60 years of age, and 42% are 60+.
Mainly these are people with no qualifications for the job, no past
experience of the problems and pitfalls. Some are thrust into the role
reluctantly, others through their compassion but have less capability.
It has been described as the ''36-hour day'' or ''potentially the most
violent of our institutions''.
The most thought-provoking contribution came from Gerry Reid of
Caledonian University's community health department. What right, he
asked, have we to impose our definition of abuse? One family's harsh way
of talking to one another would be regarded as abuse by many of us. Poor
housing provision need not be a slum but could be the fact that granny
has to live in a small bedroom while the three kids crush up in the
other. Then the kids' friends don't want to come around any more because
they don't like the smell. And granny has started getting up in the
middle of the night to make soup because she thinks it's lunchtime . . .
and the lady of the house is at her wits' end from sleep deprivation.
Who should get the sleeping pill -- her or granny? And who is abusing
whom?
Mr Reid pointed out that in the US, the category of elder abuse was
recognised in law whereas in the UK a Select Committee concluded there
was no problem. The complacency of that position had to be balanced with
the fact that many people came to the issue with their own agenda. The
best solution to case studies was to have a multi-disciplinary team
(doctor, social worker etc) as well as the family so that the agenda was
broader and more possibilities explored.
It would be nice to end this article on a ringing declaration for
action in this direction or that. Those who are involved in the
realities know it is not as easy as that. As I said last week about
vagrancy, we can only hope that compassion and common sense hold sway.
They are the best antidotes to abuse of any kind.

I WONDER how many of your readers have checked their gas bill for the
last quarter, especially if it was an estimate.
On receipt of my bill for the recent quarter of #287, in view of our
low use of gas during our splendid summer I checked the meter and found
I had been overcharged #162.
If this has been general, the mind boggles at the amount of surplus
cash, interest-free, at the disposal of the fat cats of our gas company
over the next three months.
My last three bills have all been estimates, always a few pounds above
what has been used. Have they not noticed the summer we have had?
And what was the estimate based on, when on the same period last year
of a normal summer my bill was #138?
I can well understand that cash flow is not the problem with them that
it is for the rest of us.

IT IS easy to see why a water company might like to take over a
regional electricity supplier. The water companies are thirsty for cash
to invest in the improvement of what has often been a neglected public
utility. The electricity suppliers generate a lot of cash, far more than
the Government realised was possible when they were privatised, and
encouraged to save labour. The financial fit is probably beyond dispute,
hence North West Water's bid for its almost geographical coterminous
electrical equivalent, Norweb. And it is possible to identify some scope
for savings in a single administrative structure and associated job
losses. It is, however, otherwise impossible to see any compelling
reason for this merger. The phrases usually trotted out at such a time,
''industrial logic'' or ''synergy'', for example, can hardly be
deployed, and although North West's chairman talks about benefiting
customers, it is impossible to see whence significant consumer
advantages would spring.
The regulators involved seem to have been consulted by the water
company -- and, therefore, have obviously not ruled out the notion from
consideration. (Would they anyhow have the power to do so?) North West
has, however, said that the bid will lapse if it is referred to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. That should deter no-one. This is a
bid which has to be referred and considered by somebody capable of
subjecting it to criteria other than immediately financial ones. The
point about job losses, though important for the individuals who might
lose their employment, is not vital: it is not the primary function of
any business simply to perpetuate particular, or existing, jobs. The
widespread worry among customers of the two companies, that far from
benefiting from their fusion, they might suffer, is another matter. It
is a real fear, and needs to be addressed. Since this model might serve
other similar proposals, it will be a convenient test case.
Plenty of highly successful British companies do exist managing what
is in effect a portfolio of distinct businesses. Hanson and BTR are
examples which many will recognise at once. Are utilities all that
different? They certainly have been in Britain (though perhaps not in
the United States, where they are even more tightly regulated). About
one-fifth of the country's water was supplied by private companies
before water privatisation, but relatively little electricity. The
general perception was, however, that all such businesses were public
utilities, whose primary impulse was public service and not profit. The
two concepts need not conflict, but in many people's minds they are
opposed. The opposition may even have been reinforced by the way in
which the utilities have appeared to abuse their freedom to pay their
top management excessively high salaries from very high profits (some of
which have been passed on to customers, especially at the promptings of
regulators). It is impossible to separate worry about the future conduct
of the management of two distinct but united utilities from the climate
of public hostility their recent financial behaviour has evoked.
Certainly this bid is novel, with quite different implications from the
electricity takeovers already sanctioned by Mr Lang.
It may be that the MMC will be able to dismiss the fears as
groundless, and impose conditions which ensure consumers do share
directly in any efficiencies which derive from the union. Such an
outcome would further diminish the distinction between the utilities and
other publicly quoted businesses, but it remains to be seen if it
transpires. If in the event of referral, North West Water's bid indeed
lapses, the matter should still be considered. This is a scenario which
could be re-enacted several times.

THIS year's Labour Party conference will see a re-run of the debate
concerning Clause Four, its wording and significance in the party
constitution. That may prove to be a minor irritant to Mr Blair and his
allies, but it is very hard to see much else to it. The renewed debate
is the price paid for avoiding a direct clash with Mr Arthur Scargill in
the courts, something which could drag on and possibly damage Labour. At
least at the conference there will be a short sharp passage of words,
confined to a single morning or afternoon. The decision has already been
taken and there will be no going back when few in the party, and
especially its new recruits, are now unaware that the clause was a
burden. Labour is so hungry for office that any other conclusion is
unthinkable, though no doubt the party's opponents would love the
unthinkable to materialise.
Will more precise Labour policies begin to materialise? Mr Bryan Gould
has been advising his former colleague that they should. It is a
delicately poised matter but increasingly it should be a matter of when
rather than if. The fun Mr Major had yesterday with Labour's plans for a
Scottish Parliament shows how spelling out precise policies can play
into others' hands. But it is in the nature of democratic politics that
parties should offer differing versions of the future, and voters should
see how far they appeal. Though, in the last resort, democratic decision
is more about trust than the assessment of a portfolio of abstract
statements of (more or less precise) intent, it is not simply a response
to invitations to trust. Nor can the Opposition depend simply on the
sustained ineptitude of the Government (though that is not to be
dismissed) and the boredom, summed up in ''it's time for a change'',
which derives from an administration having been in power for nearly 20
years.
Labour's plans for Scotland have been formulated in plenty of time
because its situation here is unique in that it already has a majority
of seats but faces a powerful Nationalist challenge as well as
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Moreover, what is proposed for
Scotland involves major constitutional innovation whose implications
need consideration -- Mr Major is right about that. Yet in other areas
of public concern there has to be informed discussion: opinion needs to
be shaped, to be prepared for change. That is especially true in
relation to future welfare provision and it may be true of education as
well. Above all there has to be some attempt to balance the demands for
improved public services with perceptions of how these should be funded.
This last may be a difficult area for Labour, but its leaders will have
to confront it during the election campaign. Questions of money are at
the heart of popular politics, and no amount of obscure debate about
revenues and taxation will eliminate the need for money.
The timing is a matter of calculation. The present election campaign
has already been running a long time and has over a year still to go.
The electorate may get bored too soon; it could be bored by mere
personalities too, although Mr Blair has been served astonishingly well
by his personal freshness, his firmness in dealing with his own party,
and his ability to appear frank and direct. These will have to be
translated to mature and detailed argument at some stage. Possibly this
year's party conference could witness the beginning of the process.

The issue of a national minimum wage threatens to rock the boat for
New Labour, Roy Rogers finds
LAST year's annual Trades Union Congress, the first since its relaunch
under dynamic young general secretary John Monks, was overshadowed by
the rail signalworkers' pay dispute.
There were fears at Congress House that the same could happen again
this year to mar the 127th congress, which opens in Brighton on Monday.
Until recently it looked as though either or both pay disputes involving
BR train drivers and NHS workers could detract from the trade union
movement's annual jamboree.
With both disputes now settled it means TUC bosses can highlight their
successful year of campaigning on such worthy issues as representation
at work, improving the lot of part-time workers, attacking executive
greed, promoting the EU social chapter, and giving a warm welcome to
Tony Blair who is to address congress for the first time since becoming
Labour leader. Or does it?
The vexed issue of a statutory national minimum wage, which soured the
final session of last year's congress, threatens to divide this year's,
as well as the subsequent Labour Party conference to be held at the same
venue three weeks later.
The problem is that both wings of the Labour movement are saddled with
policy decisions in support of setting a statutory national minimum wage
intially at half male median earnings, to be improved over time to two
thirds.
Neither wants to be tied to the #4.15 an hour (#156.40 a week) figure
which is the present highest interpretation of that figure, and there
are signs that some within the TUC would prefer to opt for the #3.63 an
hour lowest interpretation based on hourly earnings excluding overtime.
Labour leader Tony Blair insists that he remains committed to the
introduction of a national minimum wage but that specific figures should
be left until Labour is in power and then set only after discussion with
employers and unions on what the nation can afford.
Most major unions, even those committed to #4.15, have gone along with
a ploy of re-endorsing the formula but without mention of any figure.
However, amendments from the Fire Brigades Union and the construction
union UCATT seek to insert #4.15, a figure which would almost certainly
gain congress support if it remains on the agenda.
Blair and Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown have both made appeals for
trade union unity in the knowledge that it would make their position
much easier at the forthcoming party conference.
If #4.15 remains in the TUC agenda it is likely to be carried as
several of the largest unions, including Unison and the Transport and
General Workers and perhaps the GMB, would be obliged to support it.
They would then be expected to follow suit at the party conference where
at least one constituency party, City of York CLP, has a motion down
including the figure.
Even if TUC and Labour Party leaders get away with their determined
attempts to paper over the cracks, few will be fooled and relations
between the trade unions and the party they helped found will surely
continue to cool.
Blair supporters have decided that close links with the trade unions
are an electoral liability and have already successfully applied the
''don't rock the boat'' tactic to ditch the party's Clause 4 commitment
to nationalisation. They are about to deploy those same fears of a
Labour election defeat to cut the union voting strength at the party
conference and end union sponsorship of MPs.
Such tactics alongside the abandonment of an increasing number of
traditional Labour principles led to mounting criticism during the
summer from activists complaining that the so-called New Labour was
becoming increasingly autocratic.
Blair's address to Congress will give him a golden opportunity to hit
back at those critics and remind trades unionists just why they need a
Labour government committed to ''fairness not favours'' towards the
unions.
There is no doubt that after 16 years of Tory administrations and
successive tranches of trade union law which, together with the
recession, have seen union influence and membership plummet, unions are
desperate to see the return of a Labour government -- even a New Labour
one.

Is the Labour Party really so progressive when it comes to gender
politics? Jean West takes a historical look at the fight for real
democracy
KEIR Hardie, Labour's famous father, wasn't a bad sort when it came to
equality. In 1913, he wrote: ''Socialism means economic freedom, but men
may as well recognise the fact, sooner, rather than later, that freedom
must come to all, or it cannot come to any. So long as there is a class,
or a sex which is not free, that fast anchors all the rest of the
society in like bondage.''
It's a good job he didn't hold his breath because 75 years after women
won the vote, more than 90% of MPs remain male. The 1992 General
Election returned 60 women MPs, still only 9.2% of the 651 total.
Labour's Barbara Follett calculated that at the average rate of change
in recent General Elections it would take more than 20 years for women
in her party to gain equal representation.
At the beginning of the last century, women barred from trade union
activity organised themselves underground. In 1819, female efforts to
help effect parliamentary reform in what became the Peterloo Massacre
near Manchester and later in the Chartist movement, where 50,000 women
took part in a mass meeting in 1842, were substantial.
The new unions which emerged towards the end of the century later made
way for women. Tony Cliff quotes Kapp in his book Class Struggle and
Women's Liberation: in 1888-89 ''The strike of the 700 matchgirls
working for Bryant and May in East London 'was the small spark that
ignited the blaze of revolt and the wildfire spread of trade unionism
among the unskilled'.'' It seemed women had their uses after all.
More radical and dramatic gestures to win the vote, hunger-strikes and
suicides, followed with a militant campaign for women's suffrage. Fear
among men was then, and remains, a key force behind fierce opposition.
Between 1870-1914 a phenomenal 28 unsuccessful Women's Suffrage Bills
were thrown out by Parliament before women won franchise. Lesser mortals
would have surrendered.
Eight decades on, Tony Blair endorsed decisions from the 1993 Labour
Party Conference for a target of 50% of women candidates in all seats
where an MP was retiring, plus 50% of the most winnable seats to redress
imbalance of power at Westminster. Then he began back-peddling, calling
to ditch the women-only shortlists next Parliament. He said it was a
one-off move which constituted ''a quantum leap'' in consolidating the
critical mass of women represented.
Cynics labelled his moves naive and opportunist. A Scottish newspaper
survey at the end of last year, after all, suggested many voters were
firmly behind more women MPs.
In 1993 Rosina McCrae, founder of the Scottish Women's Caucus, said:
''The Scottish Executive Committee welcomes the decision of the 1993
annual conference to support the mechanism of women-only shortlists in
50% of existing, retiring, and marginal Labour seats.
''However, in recognition of the appallingly low representation among
our Scottish MPs, currently only 6%, the Scottish Executive Committee
agrees to pursue through the National Executive Committee, the
possibility of extending the mechanism of women-only shortlists to all
existing and retiring marginal Labour seats in Scotland.''
This was met with anticipated outrage. Scottish Labour executive
member Jim Stevens told a newspaper: ''I have nothing but contempt for
those who have, and continue to, glory in all-women shortlists as some
justifiable revenge for all past wrongs.''
But in the light of unravelling events was McCrae really being greedy?
Malcolm Chisholm, MP for Edinburgh Leith, said: ''I support the
maintenance of all-women shortlists. No matter how many women MPs are
elected, we are still not going to have gender balance.''
This weekend, McCrae will be among an all-women shortlist of
prospective parliamentary candidates for Ayr and Stirling, two of the
most marginal Tory seats, bracing themselves for selection.
Angry detractors claim positive discrimination is wrong. Hasn't that
been the policy in reverse for 75 years, she might counter?
Reasons cited for the poor representation of women in Parliament
include lack of confidence, unassertiveness, awkwardness with public
speaking, failure to put themselves forward. These were tackled in the
70s and 80s with day and weekend workshops, like those held early this
century by their predecessors, for women to pick up communication skills
long denied. Still they are not readily selected.
McCrae added: ''If there were more women in Parliament, reform would
have taken place long ago. The whole system is organised in the
interests of men, many of whom also happen to be fathers.''
Alice Brown, head of politics at Edinburgh University, concurred: ''No
man would have endorsed improved child care or the Zero Tolerance
campaign, for example. Research abroad suggests that women in power
change the nature of policy-making. A critical mass can really make a
difference.''
The agenda of a Scottish delegate women's conference of the Women's
Labour League in 1919 evokes a sense of deja vu. It includes: political
organisation of women, unemployed women, equal pay, protests, mothers'
pensions. It took until 1970 to effect an Equal Pay Act and only in 1945
did family allowance emerge.
Not all women in the Labour Party support shortlists. Irene Adams, MP
for Paisley North, said: ''I have never been in favour of quotas, they
give a false dawn to women.'' She put off her political career until she
was 42 because she did not want to sacrifice her children for
Westminster. But like many women in the party she is behind equal
representation from the start in any future Scottish parliament.
As for Westminster, Edinburgh University lecturer, Pippa Norris, says:
''On the basis of post-war electoral trends, we could expect the number
of women Labour MPs to increase to about 63, 75 at best. While this
would represent considerable progress, it would remain below the average
in most comparable European parliaments and far below the 30%-40% in
most Scandinavian countries.''
Was Blair scared like his predecessors, that too many women in his
Cabinet would spell political disaster, the end of the world? Did he
fear the return of the loony left and hurriedly back-tracked on the
shortlists? How long will it be before all the aspirations of that 1919
Women's Labour League group are at hand? Patience for Labour women has
been an over-rated virtue for far too long.

Jack Webster charts the wide-ranging career and immediate priorities
of new director-general of the CBI, Adair Turner
THE man about to take over as head of the Confederation of British
Industry, 39-year-old Adair Turner, came north this week to show face at
the Scottish CBI dinner -- and to renew acquaintance in a land where he
is no stranger.
For, despite the more southern accent, the English Mr Turner became an
adopted Scot at the age of four when his father came north to join East
Kilbride Development Corporation.
His primary education took place at the new town's Murray Primary
before he moved into Hutchesons' Grammar School in Glasgow. His father,
Geoffrey Turner, later became deputy director of planning for
Strathclyde region and is now retired in Argyll.
Meanwhile the boy, showing academic promise, went first to Trinity
College at Glenalmond, Perthshire, and then to Cambridge, where he ended
up with a double first in history and economics.
Add to that his presidency of the Cambridge Union and chairmanship of
the university Conservatives and you were guaranteed a high-flier who
would surely be challenging for top positions.
But where does a young man like that begin?
''After a debating tour of American universities, I made a start in
the strategic planning department of British Petroleum,'' Turner
recalls. ''I wanted to be somewhere in business or commerce. But BP
didn't give me enough work to do.
''I had friends who were in banking so I joined Chase Manhattan and
worked for them in London and New York. But ultimately I suspected I
didn't want to be in banking all the time.''
In 1982 Adair Turner joined McKinsey and Company, the leading
management consultancy which, among other things, has a habit of
providing directors-general for the CBI.
''Whereas their consultants tend to specialise nowadays, I resisted
that and, throughout the eighties, gained wide experience of everything
from telecoms and electronics to brewing and distilling.''
In the past three years with McKinsey, however, it was banking which
came back into his life, this time helping to set up appropriate systems
in Russia and other Eastern European countries which were having to
adopt to the market economy in the wake of a collapsing communism.
''It has been fascinating to see the market economies emerging,'' says
Adair Turner. ''In all these societies there are people coming through
but countries like Romania, which had been such closed societies, have
been at a disadvantage. It is much easier in places like Poland and
Hungary which had at least known capitalism 60 years ago.
''Russia had gone from a feudal, agrarian society to communism within
a short period so it is a pretty raw form of capitalism you are finding
there. It is much easier to find people who will buy some Western goods
and sell them on the streets of Moscow than it is to find entrepreneurs
with a longer-term purpose.''
In countries like Hungary and Poland, he says, the move towards
Western ways is now irreversible but the Russian position remains very
much in the balance.
All that experience with McKinsey was a preparation for the task which
Adair Turner now faces -- director-general of the CBI, the premier
business organisation in the United Kingdom.
Among his first pronouncements as he prepares to take up his new post
is that he believes it should be held for five years -- and that is how
long he intends to stay.
So what will be his priorities in keeping the interests of
wealth-creating business before government and other influential
agencies?
Naturally, Turner has a special interest in Europe, knowing that we
must remain at the heart of it while guarding against the bureaucracy
which, he believes, has a tendency to undermine business benefits from
the single market.
He approves of Britain's opt-outs from the single currency and the
social chapter and feels we are the ones who are talking honestly and
bluntly and being criticised for it. He sees no chance of a single
currency by 1999.
Another of his basic concerns is education and training: ''We are
increasing the numbers in higher education but there is evidence that
our training and education are failing to deliver the skill levels
required to ensure our continued and competitive success.''
Turner's attention to matters of numeracy, literacy, and basic work
discipline, he believes, dates back to his own traditional standards as
drummed into him at Hutchie's in Glasgow.
It all came back to him quite forcibly this week as he cast an eye
around the scene of his Scottish childhood -- and prepared to take on
the top job at the CBI.

Patrick Brogan reports that the ludicrous vanity of Senator Bob
Packwood would be hilarious if it had not led to the sordid exploitation
of his female staff
ASK any woman in any big office and she'll tell you about sexual
harassment. It's usually whispered about, protested sotto voce, covered
up by unthinking men who insist the culprit was just joking.
Now Senator Bob Packwood, the second most powerful member of the
United States Senate, has been brought down by an alliance of 18 women
who came together to protest about his behaviour. They were helped by
his own folly.
He kept a detailed diary, which included graphic accounts of his
adventures, and when the Senate ethics committee demanded to see it, he
doctored it. He cut out the most damning passages -- or rather he tried
to. However, the originals survived, to confound his claims of innocence
and to prove the attempted cover-up.
The whole sordid story was dumped on the table on Thursday, in a
40,000-page report and transcript of evidence. What is most striking is
the contrast between the way Mr Packwood saw himself and the way the
women saw him.
His vanity and foolishness is quite extraordinary. He clearly thought
himself God's gift to women. He boasted that he had sex with 22 members
of his staff over the past 25 years and ''passionate relationships''
with another 75. The women who testified thought him a drunken groper,
slobbering over them, using the power of his office to intimidate young
women and to seduce them.
''And we sat there in the office. She is a very sexy thing. Bright
eyes and hair and the ability to shift her hips. We gradually drank and
talked. I finally said to her, 'Would you like to dance?' She said 'I'd
love to.' Well, I don't need to bore you with all the details. She and I
made love . . .''
Of another member of his staff, he wrote that he had told her ''I was
feeling sorry for you and thinking I was doing my Christian duty (by
making love to her)''.
On the other hand, one of the women who testified against him called
him ''slobbery'' and ''childish''. When she was baby-sitting for him, he
grabbed her as she was leaving and kissed her, ''wet and insistent, you
know, just moving around the lips -- I just recall it as a sloppy,
sudden kiss, nothing that to my mind one could call romantic''.
Capitol Hill has old-fashioned lifts with operators, young people
doing a short stint to see Washington. One young woman said Senator
Packwood ran his hands up her leg, from ankle to crotch, while she was
working the machinery, and then leant against the wall with a drunken
grin on his face.
The diary is embarrassing enough in other respects: reporters who have
plunged into it discovered passages showing a ludicrous vanity. For
example, a description of a new hair styling he tried.
''I just blew my hair. I didn't use any gel on it at all. I just blew
it until it was about dry, combed it, and if it didn't come out looking
just right. It had just the right amount of bounce to it, and wave to
it. I came back rather confident.''
Another passage describes one of his conquests lying with him on the
floor of his office, saying: ''You have no idea of the hold you have
over people. I think it's your hair, the way (blank) combs it.''
Doubtless most men and women are prone to a level of personal vanity,
but they do not write it down in such mortifying detail.
The 18 women who gave their depositions against the senator were
mostly members of his staff. They felt pressured by him to accede to his
advances, or at least to keep quiet about them. Most of them were very
young: older women are better able to defend themselves.
Some of the testimony goes back to 1969, and the senator tried to
invoke a statute of limitations to escape blame for such long-ago
incidents. The ethics committee ruled that there is no statute of
limitations in ethics matters, and anyway observed that there was a
constant pattern of sexual harassment over the entire period.
On one occasion, discovered in the diaries, the senator consulted a
minister (unnamed). ''He came in to talk to me in a pastoral sense.
Well, it was a disastrous meeting. He doesn't think that extramarital
sex is right. He thinks in the office it's doubly unfair. He says the
disparate position, no matter what you think, the senator's senior, the
boss; the junior, subordinate woman cannot be consensual . . .
''I said, 'What did I do wrong?' And I said if there's any error it's
that I misjudged these women, and he hit the roof. He said, 'Packwood,
the cop-out of everybody who doesn't believe they did wrong is to say
they misjudged'.''
Even the day he resigned, he still insisted that he had done nothing
seriously wrong, save to take a few ''stolen kisses''. As the committee
chairman observed, in a quote from the Anita Hill case: ''It's been said
that the Senate 'doesn't get it'. Well, we got it.''
After the committee recommended unanimously, on Wednesday, that the
senator be expelled, a lot of people said this would demonstrate that
the Senate would not tolerate sexual harassment, and that women
throughout America would take heart from the demonstration and stand up
better for themselves.
We will see. Certainly the overthrow of one office wolf might give
others pause, but one victory is not enough. It is much remarked how few
female executives there are in corporations, how few female partners in
the big law firms, how few women at the top of the countless lobbying
firms in Washington.
The egregious groper may learn a lesson from the fate of Bob Packwood,
and perhaps some women who have suffered most will learn that there is
safety in numbers: one complaint would not have worked. It needed 18.
But that won't help middle-rank women break through to the top. The
United States prides itself on being the most advanced in women's
rights, but that's an illusion. It still has a long way to go.

A TEACHER at a private college who took a two-year leave of absence to
work in the Solomon Islands returned to find she was out of a job.
However a preliminary hearing of an industrial tribunal has ruled that
it will hear an unfair dismissal case brought by Miss Anne MacDougall,
of Brandon House, The Furlongs, Hamilton, against Hamilton College,
Bothwell Road, Hamilton.
Christian Schools (Scotland) Ltd which trades as Hamilton College
claimed the case was incompetent since Miss MacDougall was not its
employee when she had gone to the Solomon Islands to teach at the King
George VI school.
Miss MacDougall started work at Hamilton College in 1989 as a
mathematics teacher, when it was run by Christian Schools (North-West)
Ltd.
She told the tribunal that she had discussed with her then employer
the possibility of working abroad through a post arranged with the
Overseas Development Agency.
She produced a letter in evidence from Mrs M J Oxley, the then
chairwoman of the college's board of governors, which said: ''I feel you
have made the right decision in following your conscience and taking up
a position with the Overseas Development Agency . . .
''The Hamilton staff will be sorry to see you go, but will look
forward to your return in two-and-half-years' time.
''With every good wish for your mission to the Solomon Islands.''
Miss MacDougall later advised Mrs Oxley that she would commence her
leave of absence on January 11, 1993, and return in December 1994, and
this was acknowledged in writing.
In September 1994 Miss MacDougall wrote to Mr Naismith, the new
chairman at Hamilton, as Mrs Oxley had died, stating she would be able
to resume her duties at the college on December 12.
She received a reply, giving a start date of January 10, 1995, which
said: ''I feel sure that you will have derived considerable benefit from
your experience in the Solomon Islands.
''We look forward to your return to your former post in the
mathematics department at the college.''
Miss MacDougall replied and expressed surprise that her start date had
been changed from December to January.
She then received a letter from Mr Naismith which formally regretted
Miss MacDougall's dissatisfaction with the offer and formally withdrew
it.
The letter continued: ''I am sure that I do not need to remind you
that Hamilton College is now under new management and is indeed a
different limited company to the one whose employ you left in January
1993.''
But the industrial tribunal's preliminary hearing has held that Miss
MacDougall was an employee of Christian Schools (Scotland) Ltd trading
as Hamilton College and that there should be a full hearing on the
merits of her unfair dismissal claim.

<HEADLINE>Hospital needed emergency funding to meet its cash targets</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976470216</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LEADING Scottish hospital only managed to balance its books this
year after it received emergency funding, it was disclosed yesterday.
Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust announced that it would not have met
its financial targets without the cash aid. Although it ended the year
with a surplus of #1.8m, it warned that the next few years would be
difficult.
It received the financial help from its main purchaser, Grampian
Health Board, earlier this year.
The trust recently introduced efficiency savings of 1% at the large
Foresterhill complex in Aberdeen, hoping to cut costs by about #1m.
However, despite being the most cost-efficient acute teaching hospital
in Scotland, the managers expect the next few years to be equally
difficult.
''Our difficulties were overcome by funding from Grampian Health Board
to help reduce waiting lists. However, the problems have continued into
the current year,'' chief executive Alec Cumming said.
''We can protect and develop our services thanks to agreements with
Grampian Health Board and efficiency savings,'' he added.
Announcing the figures for 1994-95, the finance director, Mr Douglas
Lindsay, said: ''They cannot show the struggle that we had to achieve
them, both in absolute terms, and the uncertainty of income caused by
our increasing dependency on non-recurring income and erratic income
from GP fundholders.
''We have the need for a predetermined income so that we can properly
plan for clinical services.
''When combined with constant increases in demand for quality and
quantity of services, this uncertainty makes long-term planning
exceptionally difficult.
''We are always conscious for the need to provide efficent services.
We are also aware of the need to ensure that the impact of any
efficiencies should have minimal impact on our patients and employees.''
Once a major rationalisation process -- including a completely new
children's hospital and relocating of most services to the Foresterhill
site -- is complete, Mr Lindsay sees a brighter future.
However, he added that it was crucial that there was immediate further
investment in services and the trust was in negotiation with GHB and the
region's fundholding GPs to achieve this.

JOINT development of new technologies could save oil and gas companies
millions of dollars, the Offshore Europe conference was told yesterday.
In the final session, entitled 2020 Vision, Mr Zeke Zeringue,
executive vice-president of global operations for Halliburton Energy
Services, gave the example of two oil and gas companies and two service
companies each individually spending $10m to develop the same
technology.
He explained: ''One may have a slight advantage over the other, but
usually only for a very short time, and in the process it has cost the
industry $40m.
''If we identify the technologies which will provide little
competitive advantage to any single company we can work together to
develop the appropriate solution.
''The research and development investment would be significantly less,
creating better efficiency for the industry and for the individual
companies.''
Mr John Hyslop, chairman of major contractor AOC International, backed
Mr Zeringue's ideas on co-operation. Mr Hyslop said: ''To optimise our
business, further co-operation, integration and organisation of our
collective resources will be required.
''Additionally we need to look and seek out value for money. We need
to maximise the use of technology where applicable and, importantly, we
collectively need to get alignment of cultures in the sense of business
and organisational cultures.''
Mr Hyslop predicted an increase in contractor owned and operated
facilities, particularly floating production-storage and offloading
vessels which will be leased or provided under production sharing or
other commercial arrangement.
Shell's managing director, Mr Heinz Rothermund, predicted that world
gas consumption will grow by at least half over the next 25 years. He
said it was a highly efficient fuel, particularly in modern gas-fired
power plants, and its cleanliness made it attractive in a world
increasingly concerned for the environment.
Mr Rothermund said that gas liberalisation had delivered considerably
lower prices to industrial and commercial consumers and domestic
customers should soon enjoy similar benefits.
He said the previous ''downstream'' monopoly (British Gas) had many
inefficiencies but Britain's self-sufficiency in gas was a vital
economic strength and the impact of the changes to the ''upstream''
industry (gas extraction, transportation and storage) had to be
considered.
He urged producers and purchasers to consider the requirements and
costs of transporting gas onshore and address future funding of
long-term ''upstream'' projects.

THE Government yesterday turned down calls for an independent review
of BP's oil spill contingency plan for the new Foinaven field, west of
Shetland.
Pleas from Shetland Islands Council and the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds for a second opinion were rejected by Energy
Minister Tim Eggar.
A spokesman for Mr Eggar said that BP was discussing the council's
concerns about potential pollution from tankers loading at the Foinaven
wellhead in the open Atlantic and a ''compromise'' was being worked out.
''We see no need for an independent, scientific peer review,'' he
said. ''The review we undertake offers all we require and the
introduction of any other body could . . . actually make that review
less impartial.''
The Department of Trade and Industry was confident that the
Government's Marine Pollution Control Unit's ''experience, competence
and impartiality'' were internationally recognised. ''We cannot conceive
of a better source of impartial advice.''
In early July the RSPB criticised the contingency plan's figures and
questioned if enough equipment and materials could reach a west Shetland
oil spill. A week later, worried councillors called for a second opinion
after BP admitted that in bad weather there was little chance of
containing a spill -- and that oil could reach the Shetland coast in as
little as 19 hours.
A council spokesman said yesterday: ''We have received a letter from
the Minister, and it will be going to the council for consideration.''
Councillor Brian Gregson (Independent, North Yell &amp; Fetlar) said last
night: ''The Government have a duty to commission an independent review,
but, as they refuse to, then I'll be seeking ways for the council to
commission its own.''
Mr Gregson, who is vice-chairman of the council's environment
committee, said BP's statistics appeared to be suspect. ''Nor am I
convinced that they propose to have enough kit to deal with a spill out
there. Councillors are not satisfied that BP have looked hard enough at
a pipeline as an alternative, safer way of extracting the oil.''
The Foinaven production, storage and loading ship Petrojarl IV is due
to start work in six months, loading shuttle tankers which will take oil
to the Flotta terminal in Orkney for storage and onward shipment to
market.

CARDINAL Thomas Winning last night used a special Mass to apparently
attack the latest thinking by the Labour Party on poverty.
In the past the Labour Party in Scotland has counted on winning
support from the majority of Catholics in the country. However, the
Cardinal's address in St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow, implies he is
unhappy at Labour Party attempts to apportion more blame on the poor
themselves.
Cardinal Winning told the congregation celebrating the 150th
anniversary of the St Vincent de Paul Society in Scotland: ''Whatever
else may be said about economic growth in Britain today, poverty is
alive and well and thriving.
''What is infinitely worse of course are the attitudes towards the
poor taking root at all levels of society. Increasingly we are seeing
the acceptance of a particularly narrow ideology which pinpoints the
poor themselves, rather than poverty, as the real problem.
''Thus the easily identifiable targets are named as beggars, drunks,
addicts, windscreen squeegee merchants and the like -- a neat shift from
tackling the core issue of the breakdown of the Welfare State in the
rush to prove that taxes need not rise.''
His speech is a clear reference to remarks earlier this month by
Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, who called for the
streets to be reclaimed for law-abiding citizens from the ''aggressive
begging of winos, addicts and squeegee merchants''.
Although the Cardinal is regarded as a keen supporter of many Labour
Party policies, he has taken issue in the past with Labour's support for
abortion. If he also believes that Labour is watering down its
commitment to helping the poor, then the automatic support of the
majority of Catholics in the future may not be so forthcoming.
The St Vincent de Paul Society is a charity which helps the poor and
Cardinal Winning stated there was as great a need as ever for it even
although people may have thought that with the advent of the Welfare
State it would have become obsolete.

<HEADLINE>Battle lines drawn for NHS dispute next year. Nurses move in early for 8% rise</HEADLINE>

NURSING unions yesterday lodged demands for a pay rise of ''at least
8%'' next year even before members have formally approved a last-minute
deal to avert industrial action over this year's award.
Leaders of 500,000 nurses, midwives, and health visitors, in London to
publish their evidence to the 1996 pay review body, insisted such a
substantial rise is needed to close the gap with others, including
teachers, police officers, and social workers.
In Scotland, bullish union representatives not only justified the
claim for up to 10% but warned the potential for industrial action
remains strong.
Health trusts were clearly aghast by the claim, but declined to
comment, arguing it was premature to react before the pay review's
recommendations to the Government in the spring.
Some, including Central Scotland Health Care NHS Trust, appeared
especially keen to find out if the pay demands stand alone or include
offers to improve productivity.
Mr John Lambie, Unison's head of health for Scotland, said he would
not accept next year's pay rises being funded by ''efficiencies''
because ''services already have been cut to the bone''.
The unions said at least 8% was needed to halt ''a growing crisis'' in
the number of nursing staff being recruited.
They claimed that more than 13,000 nurses -- 4% of the total -- quit
the NHS last year because of pay cuts suffered in recent years.
Ms Maggie Dunn, of Unison, who chairs the unions' side, said: ''We are
facing a crisis in the future supply and demand of nursing staff. There
is a nursing shortage in the NHS which is failing to attract new
recruits.
''If the pay review body does not make a substantial award for nurses
next year, the NHS will run into very severe difficulties.''
Mr Lambie, in Glasgow, subsequently hinted that even this week's deal
for 1995, which is out for members' approval, may run into trouble
because anger among nurses is unprecedented.
Grade D registered nurses earned #14,000, and Grade G ward sisters
#18,000 -- compared with police constables on #22,800 and teachers on
#24,500, said Mr Lambie.
He added: ''Members will not stand idly by next year if the Government
tries to intervene in the independent pay review process. We have been
compromised in recent years by Government intervention in the work, and
have had enough.''
Unison has recommended the 1995 deal, which is worth 3%, because it
gives nurses ''the best of both worlds'' -- locally negotiated pay rises
from NHS trusts backed up by a 1% nationally-set review board minimum.
However, national officer Malcolm Wing yesterday acknowledged that
many trust managers are ''pulling their hair out'' because they believe
the deal gives too much to the unions.
The Royal College of Nursing, absent from this week's talks which
averted strikes, did join other unions yesterday in seeking a national
pay rise next year not based on local pay rates.
Mr Phil Gray, RCN director of labour relations, said the 8% demand was
necessary because of a growing recruitment crisis.
He added that trusts and hospitals were failing to get the right staff
in the right place at the right time.
Ms Anne Thomson, the RCN's Glasgow and Western Isles officer, said
nurses were abandoning their careers because of low pay, low morale, and
demoralising changes in the service.
She said they were undervalued, with earnings even after three years'
training way below that of inexperienced police officers, and went on:
''The potential for industrial action remains. Nurses, the coalface
workers, are at the end of their tether.''

AERO engine giant Rolls-Royce has won orders worth #105m, it was
announced yesterday.
A #70m share of the order comes from an overhaul deal involving five
European operators of Boeing 757 airliners, powered by Rolls-Royce
engines.
The overhaul work will be carried out at Rolls-Royce's Derby facility.
The other #35m comes in the form of Rolls-Royce's share of the deal
from Taiwan-based EVA Airways which has ordered up to 12 twin-engined
McDonnell Douglas MD-90 airliners powered by V2500 engines.
A Rolls-Royce spokesman confirmed that its manufacturing plant at
Hillington, Renfrewshire, makes compressor blades for the V2500 engines.
However, he said no new jobs were likely to be created.

<HEADLINE>Chauffeur jailed for a year for fraudulent Lottery claim</HEADLINE>

A CHAUFFEUR described as a Walter Mitty character was jailed for one
year yesterday for dishonestly trying to claim a share of the National
Lottery's first jackpot of nearly #6m.
Amid a blaze of publicity James Madel walked into draw organisers
Camelot's London offices on November 21 last year and handed officials a
ticket he claimed had been ripped up by his dog but which nevertheless
entitled him to #839,254.
Passing sentence at Knightsbridge Crown Court, assistant recorder
Suzanna Woollam told the 25-year-old driver that he had been convicted
of a carefully planned if inept attempt to dupe the National Lottery
into handing over what was a very large sum of money.
She said Madel, who appeared stunned at the length of the sentence,
had a history of previous convictions for dishonesty.
Not only had prison sentences failed to make him change his ways, but
just four months after being released on licence from a three-year jail
sentence he was trying to swindle the National Lottery.
She went on: ''Just because the National Lottery is in the business of
handing out money to winners that doesn't mean it is fair game to any
fraudster to try and outwit its security systems.
''What you did was take a dishonest gamble and everybody must know
that such behaviour will attract a prison sentence,'' the judge added.
Madel, of Fulham, west London, was convicted last month after a jury
heard how he made his ''half-brained and amateurish'' bid for a slice of
the jackpot winnings.
The court was told he presented Camelot officials with two halves of
what he claimed was a genuine ticket bearing the six winning numbers.
When asked why his ticket was in that condition, he said his dog had
jumped up, grabbed it and ripped it in two.
While the pieces of paper were examined, Madel posed briefly outside
for a phalanx of waiting press photographers.
But by the time he went back in, his ruse had been rumbled after it
was discovered security numbers on the two halves showed they had been
bought in different shops.
Mr Richard Kovalevsky, defending, told the court it was clear from
medical reports on his client that Madel led a Walter Mitty-type
existence.

AS much as the couturier needs models and photographers, so he needs
fashion illustrators, those lightning artists who sit through
collections with sketchpads propped on their knees, capturing the
essence of catwalk magic with a few dynamic, inky strokes, writes Anne
Simpson.
They do not seek realism but fantasy, a vision in which fluency of
line and colour conveys the mood and nuance that surround a fashion
designer's clothes. The American Antonio Lopez took this form of
illustration into a new dimension moving it, over three decades, from a
classical grace to something of such powerfully erotic and emotional
draftsmanship that its lushness and sensuality achieved true innovation.
Antonio was in his early forties when he died in New York during 1987
but his characteristic brio can now be sampled in a picture book where
essays accompanying his drawings confirm his sources of inspiration as
not just the duds on a mannequin's back but the very art of painters
like Dali, Leger, and de Chirico.
Of all fashion illustrators Antonio was the eclectic master, a style
liberator with a passionate eye.

After his own brief encounter with Kylie Minogue, Stephen Ferguson
wonders if the touch of a star can change a person's life forever
KYLIE MINOGUE changed my life. Not a big change though. Not one of
those blistering conversions that leaves shade and doubt behind, and
positions only bright light ahead. No, not one of those I'm afraid. You
could say it was a change of the flesh. Yes. One of those unmistakable,
sensual changes that only touch can bring about. Such a thing can
happen. It's the particular caress of fame, the feel of the famous, that
can bring such a change about.
Last weekend there were people in Stirling probably saying much the
same thing. Not about Kylie, but about Mel Gibson after he ran his hand
along the street railing administering momentary touches to outstretched
hands. And maybe afterwards those who were ''touched'' felt much the
same change taking place.
Word gets around. And somehow it must have spread, a long time ago it
seems; the word that the touch of fame contains something special and
should be keenly sought after.
You see it wherever someone famous can be found. At pop concerts and
film premieres, just like the one that Gibson attended in Stirling for
his film Braveheart, and at stage-doors especially. People waiting in
the rain with their arms stretched out, their muscles straining, their
fingers splayed, grasping air in the hope that the air will become an
arm or a hand, or a lock of hair. Celebrated, feted limbs -- that's what
all their desperate little hands crave.
Touch, they say, can cure all ills. Faith healers convey their healing
energy through the hands and fingers. Massage, acupuncture, and
reflexology can soothe the mind and soul through kneading and cajoling
muscles and pressure points. Sex, also, is a powerful act of release of
intimacy that can both purge the heart and forge new little empires
inside.
The human body has a natural aura of invisible heat and scented,
flavoured spirit. It is almost alive beyond itself; within the air and
the silence around it, and it thinks and feels like the mind encased
inside of it, breathing and moving with personality and deep-seated
motivations.
But it seems we believe that something even more mysterious, almost
mystical, takes place when the spotlight of notoriety shines down on
human skin and bone. It becomes something kind of luminous, something
prized. Cells seem to take on eerie potential; wondrous powers.
The skin of the famous, to us, seems to have a special quality that
our own mundane, non-illuminated flesh lacks. It is no longer quite the
same skin as that of their childhood; the skin that got muddy, that got
scraped in fights, that dressed-up in clothes too big for it. Now it is
famous flesh; flesh that seems almost too big for the world; too shiny,
too mythical and elevated.
If the human body does indeed have the power to heal then, to many, it
seems logical to assume that the touch of fame, of someone removed from
our everyday world, will bring about greater change; will contain
greater ability to heal, the effect more undeniable and greater lasting.
Hence the reason that the bedrooms of the world are littered with
late-night dreamers pouring over sections of skin that were touched by
the hand of someone famous, wondering what it means, wondering what it
will mean, and wondering why it happened to them. Some just consider it
as a sensual trophy; others anticipate a bigger design.
Eerie potential? Wondrous powers? What could the implications possibly
be of a touch from Jason Orange out of Take That? What sublime
realisation could the feel of Gibson's fingers bring about within the
heart of a reverent fan? And little Kylie Minogue -- big powers within
one so small?
It just so happened that she bumped into me. Her fault, not mine. The
Tunnel nightclub in Glasgow, late evening, colours and flavours and
atmosphere just beginning to build. Kylie, in Glasgow for the T in the
Park festival, strode across an empty dancefloor, not looking where she
was going. For a crazy second it seemed that -- if she didn't look up --
she was going to bump into me.
But not possible, I thought. Stars don't bump into people, they pass
through them or they mystically glide around them. They are passed
bumping; they left that behind along with dull, lifeless skin.
But it happened like something ghostly. The arm felt it. The moment
stretched out in the mind; it became inflated and swollen. Then she was
gone, and the nerve-endings on the arm settled. Strange the way the club
flickered for an instant as if heatwaves were rising up off the
dance-floor. But not big heatwaves. Not the kind that overwhelm and
refuse to leave. No, not that kind I'm afraid.
Maybe for some, the wet streets of Stirling had much the same little
waves last weekend after people received their fleeting strokes from
Mel.
So, Kylie Minogue changed my life. How? Because the actual touch of
her did not effect any deep change at all -- as I had probably,
childishly, thought it might. After a moment the touch felt like a
collision, a haphazard thing, like any other nightclub impact on any
cluttered dance-floor, or a brush in a crowded Stirling street. The
heatwaves were over so quickly that they were hardly worth noticing.
For me, the incident brought home the understanding that it's not the
temporary touch of famous people whom we will never truly know that
delivers change, but the lasting touch of hands that we do know and that
know us; hands that are capable of expressing love, and repeating it, so
that the mind is naturally expanding what is prolonged on the skin, not
desperately holding on to what has already left.
In a sense, completely ordinary hands produce the miracles.
So if anyone ''touched'' by Marvellous Mel in Stirling feels a bigger
design having occurred, then surely it is merely the adopting of a
design that they want the experience to have, and not because of any
special potential that the man possesses. But that may not be such a bad
thing -- catalysts for conversion can come from anywhere and everywhere
inside of us. Again, a more fascinating human phenomenon than two
Australian stars.
In post-Kylie and post-Gibson Scotland, the least that those who were
touched will be left with is a short memory of when the gap was bridged
between Hollywood and home. But if badly needed -- any time the lasting
touch falters -- they can bring the memory to mind of an instant when
they saw heatwaves on a wet Stirling street.
And if a tiny miracle like that can happen just through a haphazard
collision, then it can give hope that maybe something else wonderful
could be waiting to bump into them just a little bit further along the
street.

The changing effigy of man in the past three decades has inspired a
range of aftershaves. GERARD SEENAN finds equality has become a vital
ingredient for products in the nineties
IT BEGAN with Carmina Burana and red fingernails burrowing into hairy
chests. Next there was the well-dressed, creative, and obviously wealthy
types knocking about back alleys with a cello . Then there was lots of
hairless and muscular torsos lying in the spray on deserted beaches. And
now, now, it's lots of men/women androgynous sorts just standing there
looking aggressive and disaffected, in a designer-like way, of course.
Men's aftershaves (or eau de toilette, skin moisturiser, body massage,
balm, soap, deodorant -- take you pick, the list goes on) have run the
full gauntlet from the mark of a man to, well, the mark of a
hermaphrodite. Since the 1970s each decade has had an aftershave that
equates with the contemporary definition of masculinity.
In the seventies of flares, leather jackets, kitsch collars and Al
Pacino, masculinity was macho. It was spice and woody smells. It was
hairy chests and medallions.
In the eighties of shoulder pads, briefcases, designer suits, and
advertising execs, masculity was power. It was musky scents. It was
playing squash and drinking coffee from cafetieres. It was money.
In the nineties of deconstructed suits, glossy male mags, furniture
from Muji, dyeing your hair blonde and playing football, masculinity is
supposedly androgynous.
In the scented-man league tables Brut shone bright in the seventies
and it will always been equated with Henry Cooper standing in front of a
mirror slapping half a litre of cologne over his coupon.
That's not to say the green-bottled scent was without its rivals --
Denim tried hard to capture that seventies tack, and Old Spice surfed in
at a pretty close second.
For Thatcher's eighties, the scents became more powerful. Spice and
tack gave way to aromas of juniper and amber, and a new battle of the
cosmetic companies began.
The caring, sharing and oh-so-thoughtful face -- avec yet another
obligatory square jaw line -- of the Paco Rabanne man gave the defining
scent of the eighties a run for its money, but Yves Saint Laurent's Jazz
came out on top -- no doubt because it's ''irresistible, irrepressible,
a fragrance that dances its way into your heart'' or so it says in the
press release.
So far in the nineties, battle for aftershave hegemony, two fragrances
are fighting it out.
Draped across one citrus-scented corner in a Franco-Japanese style is
Issey Miyake's L'ea D'Issey Pour Homme, which is appparently a ''source
of life, pleasure and desire''. In the other ''fresh, spirited, original
and adventurous'' corner lies Calvin Klein's Escape for men which,
according to no less a personage than Calvin himself, ''reflects every
man's desire to make his life an adventure''.
But while these scents struggle for nineties success in the male-only
scent world, Calvin has released his new fragrance cK one.
Intended for both sexes, since ''products that put people into
specific categories do not make sense anymore,'' cK one is just the job.
In order to discover if these scents really do live up to the
(exorbitant/faintly ridiculous) claims made in the press releases, we
challenged six people to a ''blind'' smell test.
Unfortunately, no-one's olfactory perception was up to separating top,
middle, and bottom notes. But they did manage to say which were nice and
which smelt not too dissimilar to lavatory disinfectant.
Our testing panel consisted of: Joy Batey, 34, office manager; Donald
MacDonald, 32, hairdresser; Clio Bower, 24, designer; Alan Purcell, 24,
graphic artist.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976470226</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MOTHER yesterday appealed for information to help catch an ''evil''
kidnapper who subjected her four-year-old daughter to a 17-hour sex
attack ordeal.
The 25-year-old woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was
speaking for the first time since her terrified daughter was found after
being dumped 40 miles from home.
''This evil man took my little girl away, sexually assaulted her and
left her to wander around in a strange town,'' the mother said.
''He needs to be caught now. The police are doing all they can but
they need help.''
The child was seized near her home on the New Mills Estate, Newcastle
upon Tyne, on Monday and was left in Bulmer Square, Darlington, County
Durham, the next day.
The abduction has been linked to an incident in May when a
five-year-old girl was grabbed in Newcastle and dumped in the same area
of Darlington, raising fears the sex attacker could kill next time.
The mother of the victim of the latest attack was clearly under strain
as she spoke at a news conference at Newcastle's West End police
station.
She said of her daughter: ''She has been able to give just the barest
of details of what happened to her. She is blacking out sections of it.
''She just said the man took her a long way away.''
The mother said: ''The man who did this must be someone's son, he may
be married, he may even have kids of his own.
''Someone must know who he is or at least have their suspicions,'' she
said. ''Please ring the police and help if you can.''
Speaking in a faint, faltering voice and fighting back tears, the
girl's mother spoke of how the child had been playing outside when she
disappeared.
When the mother realised the youngster was missing, she called the
police and a search was carried out on the estate.
''Everybody started to panic. I thought she was dead.
''They found a piece of clothing in the park. They brought it to me to
identify but it wasn't hers.''
The mother told of her relief when her daughter was found.
''I was very relieved she had been found but obviously I knew what had
happened. I was hysterical.''
Asked about how her daughter was coping, the mother said: ''She is
very, very traumatised and will have to see a psychologist.''
A woman detective has been with the child trying to coax details from
her about the kidnapper and what happened during the 17 hours she was
missing.
Speaking about the effect on the family, the mother said: ''Every
member of my family has really gone to pieces through this. My husband
has taken it really badly.''
She described the kidnapper as ''an animal, a monster . . . he is not
human, he cannot be.
''I would not want any other mother in the world to go through what I
have been through.''
The police are hoping the appeal will jog the memory of someone who
might have information which could help.
Meanwhile, a local newspaper has offered a #10,000 reward in the hunt
for the attacker and police are sifting through information gathered
from 200 calls to incident rooms in Newcastle and Darlington.
Detective Superintendent Dave Wilson has said there was no reason to
link the two Tyneside abductions with attacks in other parts of the
country.

<TEXT>
OSTRICH farms in Scotland are to be targeted by animal rights
campaigners.
The campaigners have called the farms barbaric -- and said yesterday
they will picket them, and leaflet supermarkets selling the birds' meat,
to urge a public boycott.
Activists say the birds are not suited to the Scottish climate and
breeders are trying to ''create a market'' for the meat.
Mr John Robins, of Animal Concern Scotland, said: ''The farmers seem
to be set up for business.
''But the one thing nobody seems to be taking into account is that we
will picket these farms, and lobby people not to eat the meat.
''We are calling for a public boycott of products and will mount a
leafleting campaign at shops selling the meat.
''Ostrich farming in this country is completely unnecessary, and it is
cruel.
''The farmers can't give them their natural habitat.
''The breeders are also trying to create a market. Tests that have
been carried out haven't found a great response.''
Breeders have replied strongly to claims of cruelty, however, and say
the ostriches like nothing better than a wallow in snow.
There are now almost 30 farms dotted around Scotland.
Mr Dave Phillips, 48, vice chairman of the Scottish Ostrich Group,
said from his Aberdeen farm: ''We provide plenty shelter for them but
the only time they use it is during torrential rain. When the snow
starts they play in it and dance and pirouette. To say keeping them here
is cruel is just not true.
''And there is no way ostrich meat will not catch on.
''From a health point of view it's very good -- low in cholesterol and
fat. It tastes very similar to beef but with less fat -- that's got to
be a winner.''

FLASH flooding yesterday wreaked havoc across parts of Scotland. Road
and rail links were blocked as torrential rain caused flooding and
landslides.
A rail bridge in the north was closed amid fears of a raging river
causing a repeat of the 1989 Ness viaduct collapse. Railtrack closed
Lossiemouth viaduct on the main Inverness to Aberdeen line after the
downpour caused the River Lossie to swell rapidly.
Fast-moving waters thwarted divers from carrying out safety checks on
the bridge. On police advice, the bridge remained closed last night. The
situation will be reviewed at first light today.
ScotRail installed telemetric sensors on many Scottish rail bridges in
the aftermath of the Inverness bridge collapse. The sensor system is
automatically triggered by a rise in the water level or stronger
currents.
Railtrack said yesterday: ''As a precaution we reacted straight away
to the alert. We are just being cautious and we are not saying the
structure is definitely at risk.''
ScotRail laid on buses to take passengers between Elgin and Forres
before continuing their journey by rail. A ScotRail spokesman said:
''Ten trains going each way were affected.''
The Ness viaduct, which takes passengers on the North Line from
Inverness, was swept away on February 7, 1989. It was carrying 16 trains
a day at the time, and rail bosses admitted afterwards that, although
no-one was injured, the collapse could have caused a major disaster.
Dredging activities at Inverness, which changed the flow of the water
and eroded rock at the base of the bridge, built in 1861, were blamed
for the accident.
A huge risk assessment survey followed and all rail bridges in tidal
or fast-flowing areas of water were fitted with the telemetric system.
In Aberdeen, the inshore lifeboat was scrambled yesterday to rescue
four stranded horses from the swollen River Dee thundering through
Murtle Estate. However, the farmer reached the animals before the boat
arrived.
A Grampian Fire Brigade spokesman said: ''The dry weather has baked
the ground so there is nowhere for the rain to go -- drains cannot cope
with this volume of water.''
Extra firefighters were called in and councils handed out sandbags as
people battled to keep the water out of their homes. The main authority,
Grampian Regional Council, went into emergency session to discuss
procedures to cope with the widespread flooding.
The Spey, one of Britain's most famous salmon rivers, reached flood
level. Locals told police the river level was at its highest for 20
years.
On the main A90 road south of Aberdeen, police who dealt with six
minor accidents criticised drivers for speeding. Later, a landslide on
the Bervie Braes closed the road just south of Stonehaven.
The Aberdeen-Inverness road was also blocked at the Huntly bypass
after the River Deveron burst its banks. A nearby caravan site had to be
evacuated.
In England, freak waves swept a workman and a 16-year-old boy to their
deaths in two separate incidents. The Buckinghamshire boy's brother saw
him disappear beneath the waves near the beauty spot Dancing Ledge,
close to Langton Matravers, Dorset. An air and sea search was called off
yesterday.
A workman was killed after his dumper truck was washed into the sea by
a wave at Saltdean, near Brighton, East Sussex, where workers were
helping to improve sea defences. The victim's truck was on an undercliff
path when witnesses said it was pulled over the sea wall by a huge wave.

MINERS' leader Arthur Scargill has been granted a debate on the
abolition of Clause Four at next month's Labour conference in exchange
for abandoning a court case against the party in which he claimed the
change to the constitution was illegal.
Labour managers, confident that Mr Scargill's motion stands no chance
of passing, have chosen the path of least resistance. Mr Scargill will
have his views heard in public while the party will save an estimated
#100,000 in legal costs.
Mr Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, initiated
legal action last April after Labour leader Tony Blair won backing at a
special conference for the scrapping of the party's historical
commitment to full-scale nationalisation.
Yesterday, lawyers for Mr Scargill and Labour appeared in the High
Court in London to confirm the agreement. Costs, estimated at a few
thousand pounds, will be shared.
If Mr Scargill's case had been successful, Labour could have been
forced to abandon the new clause, causing extreme embarrassment to Mr
Blair, who made his campaign to change the party constitution a question
of confidence.
Labour sources yesterday said they were prepared to suffer the minor
embarrassment of enduring a fiery, anti-Blair speech from Mr Scargill in
exchange for avoiding the costs and risks of a court case.
Mr Scargill, who opposed the abandonment of the commitment to public
ownership, claimed victory yesterday. He had argued constitutional
changes could only be approved at the party's annual conference.
Ms Louise Christian, solicitor for the NUM and the Bakers' Union,
which also brought the case, said: ''The settlement . . . means in
effect that the party accepts it would have lost the legal action had
the High Court hearing taken place later this month.''
Mr Scargill said: ''This legal action could have been avoided if the
party leadership had not sought to amend Clause Four unconstitutionally
at the special conference in April and tried to prevent constituency
Labour parties and affiliated trade unions from submitting amendments to
Clause Four to the annual conference in October.''
Labour Party general secretary Tom Sawyer shrugged off the legal
action and insisted Mr Scargill would be overwhelmingly defeated at the
conference.

<HEADLINE>Council is owed #1.1m by health board</HEADLINE>

THE Highland Health Board, chaired by Mr John Robertson, dubbed the
Highlands' ''quango king'' has been put on Highland Regional Council's
list of bad debtors.
The board owes the council #1.1m, and, despite several letters, has
still to organise the payment, and it is costing the council #21,000 a
month in loan charges to cover the shortfall itself. The money is part
of the resource transfer from the board to the council, involved in the
council's taking over the board's Care in the Community
responsibilities.
The council's finance committee was told on August 23 that social work
director James Dick had written to the board, and had been assured the
money would be paid. The finance committee agreed on that day to send
another letter.
However, the council was told on Thursday that there was still no
satisfactory outcome. Finance committee chairman David Green said this
was placing the council in a difficult position. ''We are having to make
up for this shortfall in funding, but it is costing us #21,000 a month
in interest on loan costs. We are hard pressed for staff in the finance
department, but we can second some of the region's finance staff to the
Highland Health Board if they require it,'' he said.
Social work committee chairman James Macdonald received a letter from
Mr Robertson, who chairs the North of Scotland Water Authority and is a
board member of Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
''He writes that he has asked the general manager and the finance
director to deal with it, and then he says that the general manager is
going on holiday. Well, I'm sure we wish him all the best, but it will
be at least next week before anything is done about this,'' he said.
Convener Duncan MacPherson suggested: ''I could write him another
letter, asking for urgent action on this matter,'' with some members
shouting: ''Charge interest on it as well.''
Afterwards Councillor Macdonald said: ''We are able to finance this
shortfall ourselves just now, but if this continues until the end of the
financial year we will have to cut services to vulnerable people in our
community.
''This is just not good enough for a body like the health board. They
are now among those who are our worst debtors.''
Mr Malcolm Iredale, Highland Health Board's finance director, said
yesterday: ''This is part of the resource transfer agreement between
ourselves and Highland Regional Council, which is partly funded by
bridging finance.
''This means that resources are needed for the interim period between
services being run down by the health board, for example in mental
health care, and the time when the new services are fully operational
under Highland Region's Social Work department.
''Our bid for over #1m of bridging finance is with the Scottish
Office, but they have still to clarify whether or not we are getting the
money. But I would expect this to be clarified within two weeks.''
When asked if the board would pay interest to the council, for the
cost to them of the delay, he said: ''In the past we have paid a lot of
the money for services up front -- we have paid the full amount needed
for a year at the beginning of the year, but we have not asked for a
discount.
''We accept that many bids are going in to the Scottish Office just
now, and that there are many complex issues involved. But I would hope
that this will not spoil the good working relationships we have with the
council, which have been praised by the Scottish Office as a good
example of how Care in the Community should work on the ground.''
Millions of pounds' worth of assets have been transferred by Highland
Regional Council to the North of Scotland Water Authority. But
councillors have been warned that they now have no say in what happens
to these assets if the Government takes the next step along the
privatisation road and turns the water quangos into private sector
companies.
Under the Local Government (Scotland) Act, the council had to approve
an asset transfer scheme, which will now be submitted to the Scottish
Secretary for his approval.
After the council meeting, council vice-convener Peter Peacock
admitted that the council and the general public had lost any say in
what happens to the assets, whose value was estimated by the council's
estates manager as ''at least tens of millions of pounds''.

THALIDOMIDE victims could soon be pressing for more compensation after
scientists claimed to have proved deformities caused by the drug can be
inherited.
Lawyers advising the campaign group representing the victims say the
new evidence is certain to affect pay-outs.
Dr William McBride, who first warned the world about the morning
sickness drug taken by pregnant women in the 1960s, announced his
results at a medical conference in Dublin this week.
Until now the accepted medical view has been that Thalidomide
deformities cannot be passed on.
A number of children of victims have been born with deformities --
nine are known in Britain -- but sceptics argued that their disabilities
probably had nothing to do with the drug.
Dr McBride, an Australian, carried out tests which showed Thalidomide
could bind on to DNA in the cells of rat embryos, thereby interfering
with the genetic code.
The chairman of the Thalidomide Action Group, Mr Freddie Astbury,
himself a victim, is calling on the Government to hold a public inquiry
and wants to see more studies carried out.
Yesterday he said: ''The possibility of Thalidomide deformities being
passed on was not originally taken into account. If this new evidence
proves to be right, it will blow a blooming great hole in the original
settlement.''
Victims with serious deformities received between #30,000 and #40,000.

SCOTLAND'S new unitary authorities were yesterday urged to set up
joint committees to safeguard the future of four regional parks.
The call came after a seminar involving representatives of the new
shadow authorities, which will inherit responsibility for parks at Loch
Lomond and Clyde Muirshiel (in Strathclyde), Fife, and Pentland Hills in
Lothian.
During the seminar, Glasgow City Council was also urged to consider
joining forces with the authorities administering Loch Lomond and Clyde
Muirshiel because of the high numbers of park visitors from the city.
Some 50 officials and councillors heard chairman of the European Parks
Federation UK, Dr Jim Thompson, say that Scotland's parks had a major
role to play within the European collective.
He said that if the Scottish parks disappeared, the UK would be left
with only one Euro regional park, the Lea Valley, near London.
''A large number of people involved in the parks in Europe often look
to the UK for examples of practice over how to make things happen on the
ground.
''It would be a great tragedy if the Scottish regional parks
disappeared and this expertise were to be lost,'' he said.
He also asked delegates not to lose sight of the parks in future
budgets.
''I do think it is vital for you to retain the vision which
established the parks in the first place to try to fund the structure to
retain these parks,'' he said.
Councillor Duncan Mills, chairman of the Loch Lomond Park Authority,
revealed efforts were being made to set up a joint meeting with new
councils adjacent to the park area, and also called for financial
assistance from Glasgow.
Councillor Drew Hay, vice-chairman of Glasgow's recreation committee
said as an individual he agreed, but emphasised that the new council
would face other demands.
Earlier, Mr Peter Scott, a planning consultant to the Scottish Office
on the future of the regional parks outlined the options available to
protect them.
These included the possibility of a joint committee for Loch Lomond
and a single area authority in Fife. He also suggested the establishment
of a trust or charitable company to run the parks.
''This would have to be local authority led, but could have a much
higher private-sector, commercial input,'' he said.

NINE months after the worst flooding to hit central Scotland for
decades hundreds of families are still waiting for a long-term solution
to their problems.
In parts of Paisley and Kirkintilloch, the two areas worst affected,
there is a genuine fear that this winter could bring a return of the
devastation and trauma that came with the rising waters.
The push for a comprehensive flood-prevention strategy has fallen foul
of the reorganisation of local government. Strathclyde region, whose
responsibility it is, has virtually washed its hands of the problem
because it is to be disbanded next year.
Strathkelvin and Bearsden MP Sam Galbraith, who saw almost 250
constituents flooded out of their homes in December, said: ''The region
has responsibility, but they're folding up so they are not doing
anything. The district councils don't have any responsibility and the
new councils don't have authority vested in them until next April.''
For residents in Kirkintilloch the onset of winter brings the fear of
floods. Repairs to Donald and Regine Mackinnon's home in Kelvin Way cost
#24,000.
The Mackinnons had to stay in rented accommodation for
seven-and-a-half months, only returning at the end of June. ''We have
seen absolutely nothing happening to prevent a recurrence despite the
reassurances of politicians of all parties,'' said Mr Mackinnon.
There are proposals for a #5m flood prevention scheme in Kirkintilloch
but it will be next year at the earliest before plans get moving.
Mr Galbraith said talks had taken place with the chief executive of
the new East Dunbartonshire Unitary Authority. ''There is a will to do
it,'' he said. ''If it is not done there is the risk of businesses
pulling out.''
In Paisley, where 66 families are still waiting to return to their
homes, it would cost #130m to tackle flooding, said a regional council
spokesman yesterday. He said the council had neither the finances nor
the time to carry out the work.
''In Paisley part of the problem was that landowners had not kept
burns and culverts clear,'' he said. ''If that had been done it would
have delayed the floods but not stopped them. Work is being done to
address that.''
Renfrew District Council, which is spending #2m on repairs to flooded
homes, is currently carrying out two local schemes of flood alleviation
measures at a cost of #450,000 designed to protect its own housing
stock.
However, the expenditure is a drop in the ocean compared to what
Strathclyde region says is needed.
Paisley South MP Gordon McMaster said: ''If that is the amount of
investment required than that is what is required. It is not good enough
for the authorities to pass the buck around. Someone has to take
responsibility.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said grants were available to
local authorities for up to 50% of the cost of flood-prevention schemes:
''It is for local authorities to decide what is best for their own
areas.
''Until April, 1996, Strathclyde region has responsibility for Paisley
and Kirkintilloch. As it stands at the moment we have not received any
new flood-prevention schemes from Strathclyde.''

THE Prime Minister yesterday denied the Ulster peace process was in
crisis while maintaining his insistence that all-party talks on the
future of the province could not go ahead until the IRA agrees to
surrender its weapons.
He admitted that the postponement of the UK-Irish summit this week
following a disagreement with the Irish Government over the
decommissioning of paramilitary weapons was a setback and a
disappointment.
But he pledged Britain would continue to work with the Irish
Government and ''sensible'' democratic parties in Northern Ireland to
make sure violence ''comes out of Northern Ireland politics for good''.
His optimism was reinforced by the Taoiseach, Mr John Bruton, who
sought to mend the damage caused by the cancellation of the summit by
warning Sinn Fein he was prepared to reach agreement with Britain on
decommissioning without consulting Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams or
the IRA.
London has sought to put the blame for the collapse of the summit on
Mr Bruton, who was accused of caving in to Sinn Fein's refusal to agree
to a surrender of IRA weapons as a prerequisite for joining all-party
talks.
The two governments had agreed the wording for a proposal to create an
international commission to oversee the decommissioning of weapons. But
Sinn Fein refused to support it if it was based on Britain's
weapons-before-talks scenario.
Mr Major said yesterday: ''We will continue to work with the
government in Ireland and continue to look at what options we can
produce to ensure that we can bring that peace permanently to Northern
Ireland. It was a setback last week but it was not a crisis.''
He added: ''I very much hope that peace will stick. I think if anyone
is contemplating bringing the gun back into Northern Ireland politics, I
do not know how they could properly defend that to any audience anywhere
in the world. There is no justification for it.
''What we are asking of Sinn Fein, and indeed of the loyalist
paramilitaries as well, is that they agree a method of taking the gun
out of politics. That they agree the removal of weapons from Northern
Ireland politics and then they begin to move down the decommissioning
path because no other political parties will sit at the round-table
talks with them until that happens.
''There is a very simple point that underlines it. If Sinn Fein are
genuine and want a peaceful democratic future in Northern Ireland, then
they do not need an army at their back and they do not need weapons.''
Earlier, in a speech in Dublin, Mr Bruton said he was prepared to do
''all that is reasonable'' to create the conditions for success in the
search for peace.
He said it was up to the two governments to make progress and bring
other parties with them. ''Any move by the governments must be one that
is well prepared, and we must have a very firm understanding that it
will work.''
But, in a clear warning to Sinn Fein, he added: ''That does not mean
that we can necessarily obtain commitments in advance. In some cases,
parties might be unwilling, on principle, to give a commitment to any
proposal until the proposal had been published and debated.
''This means that the two governments can, and indeed must, act
together as governments when the time is right. That is something I am
determined to do.''
He called on Sinn Fein and the Unionist parties to accept that they
also needed to make a move for peace to succeed.
However, Mr Bruton also cautioned Britain over its refusal to show
long-term trust in Sinn Fein and the IRA. ''The people of this state
have placed their trust in Sinn Fein that the IRA will never again use
or threaten to use arms to achieve a political objective''.
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring last night spoke of his ''worry
that the quality of hope has begun to falter'' in the peace process.
He told the British-Irish Association conference in Cambridge that the
gift of hope must now come from political leaders on all sides.
Mr Spring said even if it was unrealistic to set decommissioning of
IRA weapons as a precondition for beginning talks, it was entirely
reasonable to set total disarmament as a priority and an essential goal
to be achieved through the negotiating process.

SCOTTISH computer graduates were yesterday urged to stay here to work
rather than head south or abroad for jobs.
Scottish Office Industry Minister George Kynoch said universities in
Scotland had the highest proportion of students studying computer
science and related subjects in Europe, training 8500 graduates a year.
''Although Scotland's current growth in software is substantial --
nearly three times the European average and an industry which now
employs more than 20,000 software professionals -- many of our graduates
seek work elsewhere,'' he said.
''In order to retain our home-grown talent there is much that industry
and the academic world can do. It is important that skills and
expectations are matched.''
He was speaking at the annual young software engineer awards by the
Scottish Software Federation. Overall winner was Mr Paul Holmes, from
Edinburgh, a graduate of Napier University.

<TEXT>
AN RAF Nimrod will perform exactly the same routine as the one that
ended in tragedy in Toronto two weeks ago, at Scotland's biggest air
show next Saturday.
The Nimrod from 206 Squadron at RAF Kinloss, in Morayshire, will be
put through its paces in the four-and-a-half minute display at the RAF
Leuchars event which attracts 80,000 people each year.
The Fife display takes place exactly a fortnight after seven crewmen
from the same base, Kinloss, were killed when their Nimrod flew nose
first into Lake Ontario, a mile-and-a-half outside Canada's largest
city.
Flight Lieutenant Jack Taylor, the Leuchars Air Show organiser, said:
''We expect a lot of ghouls to come along hoping to see another crash.
It is a bit sick but some people are like that.
''However, most people will just be here to see the amazing range of
planes that we will have flying on the day.''
But he added: ''We are delighted that the crew have decided to take
part in the show. They have told us they will arrive and leave on the
same day. They are keen to get back in the saddle.''
RAF Kinloss confirmed that a Nimrod would be taking part in the show
and that it would be giving the same display as the aircraft which
crashed in Toronto.
Squadron Leader John Horrocks said: ''Display flying is currently
under review but until we are told otherwise, we will continue as
normal.''
He added: ''The crew are looking forward to taking part in the air
show. Everyone has confidence in the aeroplane.''
Squadron Leader Horrocks denied that its participation is badly
advised given that the RAF Board of Inquiry had not yet established the
cause of the crash in Canada.
He said: ''If we had any doubts about the aeroplane whatsoever, we
would not be taking part.''
Squadron Leader Kevin Havelock will pilot the reconnaissance aircraft
in the display which will take place partly over the mouth of the River
Eden, near St Andrews.
He is an experienced Nimrod pilot who has been at RAF Kinloss for more
than three years this time round. He was at the base 11 years ago but
left to fly P3 planes with the Australian Air Force before returning in
1992.
The one-day show will see planes from all over the world flying above
RAF Leuchars.
Aircraft from North America, Iceland, Italy, France and Belgium are
already lined up to appear.

IT'S as if the city is caught in some perpetual twilight zone, streets
laid open with emptiness, footsteps echoing on paving stones polished
thin by the bustle of years past.
At this time of year, Dubrovnik should be playing host to tens of
thousands of tourists, clogging the cafes on the Stradun and clattering
down the narrow alleyways towards the harbour.
This week, as in the previous weeks, months, and years, the town lies
quiet under the ominous but unseen presence of Serb guns in the hills
above, and the massed ranks of Croatian troops poised to push them back
out of range.
Dubrovnik has suffered badly in the Balkan conflict and the latest
developments in Geneva do little to ease the layer of tension and trauma
for a town well-versed in the tragedies of war.
The Serbs laid siege to the town in 1991 during Croatia's war for
independence from Serbian-led federal Yugoslavia, killing numerous
civilians and inflicting serious damage on the old town's Venetian walls
and Renaissance-era facades.
At one time, shells were raining down on the city at the rate of one
every 20 seconds.
More recently, the Serbs have continued to lob mortars into the
suburbs from their vantage point to the north-east.
Croatia, buoyed by optimism from the capture of the Serb-held Krajina
region one month ago, moved troops down into position around Dubrovnik
and have promised to end the Serb threat once and for all.
As we try to find our way through Dubrovnik's modern sprawl to the old
walled city, we notice two people in a dirty car trailing us this way
and that as we cross junctions and head up streets that lead nowhere.
We're getting nervous, so we pull in abruptly at a bus stop. The car
stops behind us and the driver identifies himself as a local employee of
the rental company we had used in Split.
''I saw that you were in one of our cars and I wondered if you needed
any help,'' he said cheerfully.
It is a good place for worst assumptions. Every clunk of building work
is an incoming mortar, every dropped object a sniper's bullet.
''We do get used to this. When you are in such a situation for years,
you have to,'' says Antonija Merkas, 23, who is sitting flicking through
a magazine in a tiny newsagent's just off the main square.
''There is still some shelling and we are all expecting further
fighting. We are all sure that there will be more, but at the moment we
are just trying to lead normal lives -- as normal as they can be.
''I went swimming the other day when they were shelling, and I was in
the sea and I could hear these noises, thud, thud, thud in the distance.
''There are some people who would think I am a little crazy, but that
is the way that we have to live for the past couple of years.''
Outside the shop, a small remote-controlled car is hurtling back and
forward across the square closely followed by two small boys.
They seem oblivious to the fact that the high-pitched buzz of their
toy is almost drowned out by the intermittent roar of warplanes
overhead.
They spot two elderly women chatting comfortably and send the car over
with thinly disguised glee to career across their toes.
An old man, tottering down the edge of the street, comes over to shake
our hands, laughing uproariously and posing obligingly for pictures.
Up another alleyway, in a small empty leather shop, the proprietor
takes exception to questions about the palpable tension and the dearth
of visitors in the town.
''Why are you coming to stare like this?'' he says, re-arranging his
unsold wares with an angry scowl. ''We are tired of the West looking at
us. We are just living.''
Certainly, there is little sign of visible damage. Here and there are
small groups sitting defiantly outside the few cafes that are open, but
the old town statues have been boarded up behind clumsy wooden boxes and
the graceful aquarium is doubling as a bomb shelter.
Antonija, meawhile, has been encouraged by the sight of a small number
of tourists who have weighed the risks and chosen to holiday in the
area.
She would love to think that the city could at some point regain its
reputation as the perfect holiday spot, but is realistic enough to know
that tourism and mortar fire don't mix.
''Can you tell them back there that Dubrovnik is still a lovely
place?'' she says, hopefully, then stops herself.
''But you will have to tell them about what is in the hills. You will
have to tell them about that. Won't you?''

THE US peace envoy Mr Richard Holbrooke may have claimed a major
victory yesterday with the accord on basic principles for settling the
Balkans conflict, but the road to final peace remains strewn with
dangerous obstacles.
One of the most difficult -- the question of how to deal with the
region of Eastern Slavonia -- spoiled what would have otherwise been a
perfect day for Mr Holbrooke.
The outstanding issues holding back US steamroller diplomacy are
territorial, especially the fate of the Croatian Serb enclave of Eastern
Slavonia and Sarajevo itself.
The rich farmlands of Eastern Slavonia were taken by Serbia in 1991
and the area, which is thought to contain significant oil reserves,
remains the last part of Croatia in Serb hands.
Zagreb already has retaken other Serb areas in recent months,
including the Krajina region. Now it is feared the eyes of Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman are firmly set on a further success in Eastern
Slavonia.
Mr Holbrooke tried and failed to secure an agreement between the rump
of Yugoslavia and Croatia on the issue, which would have committed them
to solve the problem by peaceful means.
''We are going to continue to work on it as a top priority, as an
integral part of a comprehensive settlement,'' he told a news conference
after the Geneva meeting.
A senior contact group source said a joint statement was agreed in
respective capitals on Thursday night, but that Serbia then rejected it
because of fears that it would condone re-integration of Eastern
Slavonia into Croatia.
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic struck a defiant note after the
Geneva meeting, saying Zagreb would never give up the remaining part of
its territory still held by rebel Serbs.
Mr Holbrooke also gave his view on the enclave -- one that will not
please Belgrade.
''All the nations represented in this forum today believe strongly and
unambiguously that the Eastern Slavonian problem should be settled
peacefully and that Eastern Slavonia is clearly part of the Republic of
Croatia,'' he said.
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic did not lift a finger to defend
other Serb enclaves in Croatia. However, Serbian political sources claim
Eastern Slavonia is a wholly different matter.
As for Bosnia, Mr Holbrooke acknowledged the warring parties still had
completely different views on how the territory should be divided
between them.
Bosnian Serbs insist on widening the narrow corridor linking the land
they hold, taking the mainly-Muslim enclave of Gorazde in eastern
Bosnia, keeping Serb-held parts of Sarajevo and maintaining access to
the sea.
The Bosnian President, Mr Alija Iztebegovic, has flatly rejected the
notion of a divided Sarajevo or of yielding Gorazde, a symbol of Muslim
resistance against besieging Serbs.
''Sarajevo is certainly the most critical territorial issue in my
mind,'' Mr Holbrooke said. ''It reminds me a little of Berlin and
Jerusalem.''
Western analysts believe that what may prove the ace in Mr Holbrooke's
hand is that he has the world's only remaining superpower firmly behind
him.
''It's America's reputation as the leading world power at stake here,
not to mention the fate of Bill Clinton in the presidential elections,''
said one diplomatic observer.
However, another added a note of caution: ''Let's not go ballistic
over all this. There is just too much road to cover and there are too
many loose cannons on deck that could still sink the ship.'' -- Reuter.

The following is the text of the basic principles agreed yesterday by
rump Yugoslavia, Croatia and the Muslim-led Bosnian government for a
new-shape Bosnia:
1. Bosnia/Herzegovina will continue its legal existence with its
present borders and continuing international recognition.
2. Bosnia/Herzegovina will consist of two entities, the Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina as established by the Washington Agreements (of
1994) and the (Serbian) Republika Sprska.
* The 51:49 percentage territorial proposal of the Contact Group is
the basis for a settlement. This territorial proposal is open for
adjustment by mutual agreement.
* Each entity will continue to exist under its present constitution
(amended to accommodate these basic principles).
* Both entities will have the right to establish parallel special
relationships with neighbouring countries, consistent with the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia/Herzegovina.
* The two entities will enter into reciprocal commitments (a) to hold
complete elections under international auspices; (b) to adopt and adhere
to normal international human rights standards and obligations,
including the obligation to allow freedom of movement and enable
displaced persons to repossess their homes or receive just compensation;
(c) to engage in binding arbitration to resolve disputes between them.
3. The entities have agreed in principle to the following:
* The appointment of a Commission for Displaced Persons authorised to
enforce the obligations of both entities to enable displaced persons to
repossess their homes or receive just compensation.
* The establishment of a Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Rights
Commission, to enforce the entities' human rights obligations. The two
entities will abide by the commission's decisions.
* The establishment of joint Bosnia/Herzegovina public corporations,
financed by the two entities, to own and operate transportations and
other facilities for the benefit of both entities.
* The appointment of a Commission to Preserve National Monuments.
* The design and implementation of a system of arbitration for the
solution of disputes between the two entities.

GREENPEACE yesterday reaffirmed its total opposition to the deep sea
dumping of the Brent Spar. However, the environmental organisation
welcomed the fact that Shell was studying 200 onshore disposal options
for the redundant North Sea oil installation.
This follows a meeting between Shell chief executive Dr Chris Fay and
Greenpeace executive director Lord Peter Melchett.
Brent Spar is now anchored in a Norwegian fjord, and Shell has started
work on a review of more than 200 options for its onshore disposal or
re-use.
Shell says: ''The purpose of the review is to identify the BPEO (Best
Practicable Environmental Option), recognising that, on balance, this
would need to pose no greater risk to the environment or to human safety
than those calculated for the existing BPEO -- deep water disposal.''
The contents of the Brent Spar are being independently analysed by Det
Norske Veritas in Norway, and the results of the audit will be available
next month. The option appraisal is not expected to be complete until
late next year.
Shell says its review of options and any new proposal for disposal
will be the subject of extensive consultation with interested parties,
including Greenpeace.
Dr Fay and Lord Melchett met informally on Wednesday to discuss their
differences, and afterwards Dr Fay said: ''It was a useful opportunity
to air differences over the Brent Spar. We also had a constructive
exchange over the wider aspects of the decommissioning of redundant
offshore petroleum installations.''
As a follow-up, Shell suggested a meeting with Thilo Bode, a leading
European activist in Greenpeace International, probably next month -- an
invitation accepted yesterday.
Greenpeace yesterday welcomed the fact that Shell was studying 200
onshore disposal options, but Lord Melchett said: ''Greenpeace reaffirms
its absolute opposition to deep sea disposal of the Brent Spar. The
dumping of the Brent Spar would have created an unacceptable precedent
for dumping other contaminated structures in the sea.
''Greenpeace have always believed in the fundamental principle that we
should no longer needlessly dump wastes into the environment and that we
must act responsibly to reduce waste, recycle non-hazardous waste and
treat or contain harmful materials.''
Shell planned to sink the Brent Spar in the Atlantic this summer,
having received Government approval for dumping after extensive
investigation into the Best Practicable Environmental Option.
However, Shell was forced to abandon the plan after a Greenpeace
campaign which included boarding the Brent Spar twice.

<HEADLINE>10 die at hospital hit by UN force, Serbs claim</HEADLINE>

Pale
AS Nato warplanes inflicted more punishment on Bosnian Serbs today,
official media in Pale reported that artillery of the UN Rapid Reaction
Force had hit a hospital in a Serb-held suburb of Sarajevo, killing 10
people and injuring others.
The report followed a mortar attack by Serbs on Sarajevo's main
boulevard which sprayed shrapnel across a crowded pavement, wounding
seven people, including a child.
Government-run Radio Pale reported that the hospital shelling had
killed one person inside and the rest within 60ft of the building. There
was no independent confirmation of the incident.
It came as the Bosnian Serb leader, Dr Radovan Karadzic, demanded an
end to Nato air strikes, declaring that his army would use heavy weapons
only in defence and inviting the alliance to monitor its compliance.
''We will not use heavy weapons except in self-defence,'' he said on
Bosnian Serb television. ''They (the West) can have their observers and
monitor our promise.''
However, he gave no indication that the Bosnian Serb army was about to
bow to UN demands, reinforced by seven days of Nato air attacks, to pull
back heavy weapons from UN-designated ''safe areas'' such as Sarajevo.
''We demand that Nato halt its attacks,'' said Dr Karadzic, appearing
in camouflage fatigues. ''We will not allow the Serb people to be
disarmed.''
However, in spite of the developments in the Geneva peace talks, Nato
confirmed that it continue the air attacks until the weapons were
withdrawn.
The commander of Nato's southern forces emphasised the determination
to press on with the attacks, saying that he could get even tougher.
''We have not yet tapped the full capability of the air or ground
forces,'' said Admiral Leighton Smith, speaking at a Nato conference.
''They ought to understand that they are losing some pretty valuable
stuff,'' he said of the Bosnian Serb army.
Russia today demanded a UN Security Council debate on the Nato
bombing, the first open discussion since raids on Serb positions began
10 days ago.
A traditional ally of the Serbs, Russia also demanded that Nato halt
air strikes against the Serbs because of doubts over who carried out the
attacks on Sarajevo that prompted them.
''Russia insists that the United Nations look again at the situation
in Bosnia in the light of new evidence on the blasts in the Muslim
regions of Sarajevo. Until then, Nato military action in Bosnia should
be halted,'' President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary said in a
statement.
The roar of warplanes today was followed by powerful explosions that
lit up the sky around the Serb-held suburb of Lukavica before dawn.
Hours later, Bosnian Serbs reported attacks on the town of Kljuc in
western Bosnia.
More huge blasts were heard from Serb-held Hadzici southwest of
Sarajevo, and from other suburbs west of Sarajevo after Nato jets
swooped over. Bosnian Serbs fired an anti-aircraft missile at a Nato jet
near Sarajevo but it apparently missed.
Nato's conditions for a halt to the bombing are no more Bosnian Serb
attacks in UN-declared ''safe areas,'' removal of all Bosnian Serb heavy
weapons from around Sarajevo, and the opening of Sarajevo airport.
''My expectations are we will see some compliance, or intent to
comply, then of course we will be looking for some movement on the part
of the Bosnian Serbs to demonstrate their intent to comply,'' Admiral
Smith told a Nato conference in the Belgian seaside town of Knokke
Heist.
Barring that, the attacks could get even more violent. ''It is a
graduated response,'' he said.
In Sarajevo, as doctors treated the vicitims of the Serb mortar shell
attack, a policeman said: ''Several of the wounded are teenagers and one
is a child of about eight years old. Several are badly wounded.''
An elderly woman at the scene shouted: ''Chetniks (Serbs), the Chetnik
bastards did this.'' -- AP/Reuter.

SKETCHES by John Lennon are expected to fetch up to #120,000 at
auction next week, 37 years after the Beatle swapped them for a bright
yellow sweater.
They go under the hammer at Sotheby's in London on Thursday as the
highlight of a two-day sale of rock and roll and pop memorabilia with
mementoes from many top stars up for grabs.
Elton John's old glasses, Bob Dylan's mouth organ and posters from
concerts dating back to the 1950s are likely to draw fans from all over
the world.
The drawings were made by Lennon when he was an 18-year-old student in
Liverpool and he struck up a friendship with fellow student Helen
Anderson.
They are inscribed: ''Helen Anderson Liverpool Art College 1959 From
John Lennon or Heloon as otherwise known''.
Lennon had admired her bright hand-knitted yellow sweater and thought
it would be perfect for a gig with his then band, The Quarrymen.
As he coveted the sweater so much, she said he could have it in return
for some of his caricatures of teachers and fellow students.
She only wanted four, but he gave her a book full and often looked at
them over the years as a memory of her old friend who was gunned down
outside his New York apartment in 1980 by a crazed fan.
Miss Anderson, now 53, said: ''I have looked at them often over the
years and they always make me roar with laughter. They are so good, so
accurately and confidently drawn with fine graphic work.''
Some examples of Lennon's art work have appeared in sale rooms around
the world since his death, but this is the largest single collection
ever offered for sale and has excited huge interest.
Other items include hand-written song lyrics by Paul McCartney, which
are expected to fetch up to #15,000; a Jimi Hendrix guitar; and a poster
for Buddy Holly and the Crickets at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on
March 20, 1958, when the warm-up man was Des O'Connor, described as the
''comedian with the modern style''.

TOURIST numbers in Caithness so far this year are showing an increase
for the first time in five years despite bad publicity surrounding
Dounreay, according to the area's director of tourism.
Mr Ian Sargeant's comments yesterday follow a meeting in Thurso on
Tuesday night when a special action group was set up following specific
concerns in the community that bad publicity was hitting tourism and
other businesses directly. However, Mr Sargeant told The Herald there
was absolutely no evidence of that.
''I have been in touch with staff at all three information centres in
the county and there is no evidence that people are being put off coming
here. Indeed, visitor numbers seem to be up by 6%.
''People do ask if it is safe to come here and we always say it is.
But they are not asking that any more than they were eight or nine years
ago. There was a good deal more publicity over the Nirex proposal to
establish the first national nuclear waste repository here a few years
ago and we didn't see a downturn.''
Mr Sargeant said he wasn't dismissing the concerns that had been
expressed. ''These are legitimate worries in an industry where image is
so very important, and it is right they are aired. But there is no hard
evidence to support the idea that tourism here is suffering.
''In fact, after 1990, a pattern of decline set in and this is the
first year that we have seen an increase and it seems we might have
turned the corner. It is very much in line with the reports I have
received from colleagues in Sutherland, Ross-shire and Inverness.''
Mr Geoffrey Minter, the Caithness landowner with land near Dounreay
who was chosen at Tuesday's meeting to chair the new action group, could
not be contacted yesterday as he is on holiday. But at the meeting, he
was in no doubt that the image of Caithness was suffering as a result of
the adverse news coverage of Dounreay.

A CANCER victim was jailed for three years yesterday for her part in a
drug supplying operation.
Mother-of-one Ann Poole, 41, and co-accused Charles Gourlay, 43, were
sentenced at the High Court in Inverness yesterday.
The court heard they were ''just two cogs in the wheel'' of a much
larger organisation.
Poole, from London, sent cannabis with a street value of #10,000 from
Euston Station to Gourlay, of Smithton Villas, Inverness, via the Red
Star rail delivery system.
But the smuggling operation reached the end of the line when police,
acting on a tip-off, intercepted the 2kg package and arrested Gourlay as
he made the collection at Inverness railway station.
Poole's defence counsel produced evidence that the unemployed woman
worked for ''various charities and that kind of pursuit'', and asked
Lord Kirkwood to take account of the effect prison would have on her
health.
Poole has been treated for cancer for the past six years.
The counsel added: ''Any sentencing on this lady would be devastating
-- all I'm asking is for my Lord to make sure the devastation is not
total.''
Defence counsel Crawford Gibbons said Gourlay had received a call from
a friend, John Cooper, asking if he would look after a package for him
for a few days.
Mr Cooper, a long-term alcoholic, died two months ago , the court
heard.
Mr Gibbons said: ''Although my client admits he knew what was in the
package, he had no idea of the value attached to the contraband. He
stood to gain nothing from the package.''
The pair earlier admitted being concerned in the supply of cannabis on
October 18 last year, at various locations.
Lord Kirkwood sentenced both to three years in prison.

A JUDGE has ruled that a window cleaner who is suing his brother after
falling off a ladder was not covered by the 1966 Construction (Working
Places) Regulations.
Mr David Edie was cleaning the upstairs window of a house in Lawrie
Terrace, Loanhead, Midlothian, when the ladder moved and he fell 12ft to
the ground. He landed on a flower bed and suffered injuries to his back.
The accident happened in March 1991 and although Mr Edie has made a
substantial recovery he still suffers pain and stiffness in his back.
His is suing his brother, Mr Tim Edie, trading as TP Window Cleaning
of Traprain Terrace, Loanhead, in the Court of Session, claiming damages
of #50,000.
He claims that his brother, who denies liability, was negligent in
having no-one support the ladder but also that there was a breach of the
1966 Construction (Working Places) Regulations.
The negligence claim is set to go to a full hearing but the case went
before Lord Gill for the judge to consider the alleged breach of the
1966 regulations.
Mr David Edie, of Corstorphine Road, Edinburgh, argued that the window
cleaning was a ''building operation'' within the meaning of the
regulations.
A building operation is defined as ''the construction, structural
alteration, repair or maintenance of a building, including repointing,
redecoration and external cleaning of the structure''.
Mr Tim Edie maintained that the regulations did not apply to the case
because the window cleaning at the house was not a building operation.
Counsel for Mr David Edie submitted that ordinary window cleaning came
within the scope of the regulations because it amounted to both the
external cleaning of the structure and the maintenance of it.
Lord Gill said, however: ''In my opinion the operation of ordinary
window cleaning . . . is not a building operation in terms of the
regulations.
''The essential question is whether the glass in the window of a
dwellinghouse is part of the structure of the building.''
He was referred to a number of previous cases in Scotland and England
where the same question had arisen. These indicated that the answer
depended on the different ways in which glass was used in a building.
''There will be cases where glass in a building is part of the
structure, for example where it forms an external wall or the roof. On
the other hand, where glass in a window simply has the function of
admitting light and repelling the elements it cannot, in my view, be
said to be structural in nature.
''In the present case I consider that the ordinary task of cleaning
the outsides of the windows of a dwellinghouse cannot be said to
constitute the external cleaning of the structure of the building
itself. It is therefore not a building operation.''
Lord Gill also rejected the argument that even though windows were not
structural, cleaning them still constituted maintenance of the building.
He ruled that maintenance had to be cleaning of the structure and
dismissed the part of the case based on the 1966 regulations.

Washington
WORLD leaders were united in welcoming the Geneva agreement but
reflected the remaining concerns about how to make it endure.
President Bill Clinton called the breakthrough ''an important
milestone on the road to peace'' and urged the warring parties to show
flexibility in talks for an overall settlement.
For Mr Clinton, the principles for peace mark a rare piece of good
news from the Balkans.
In a written statement, he said they should allow the parties to move
toward intensive negotiations for a full peace agreement. ''Today's
successful meeting in Geneva . . . is an important milestone on the road
to peace in the former Yugoslavia,'' he said.
But he added: ''Much remains to be done in translating these
principles into a final peace agreement. All the parties will need to
display the same flexibility and statesmanship that made today's
agreement possible if we are to turn away from war and achieve our
common goal of a durable peace in the Balkans.''
US envoy Richard Holbrooke is to return to Washington to brief
President Clinton on Monday before returning to Europe to resume his
shuttle diplomacy next week.
President Clinton's Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, told a
State Department briefing the parties to the Bosnian conflict had
''agreed to take an important step''
He added: ''We're moving into a new phase now, an important step has
been taken today. These basic principles have been agreed to, and there
will be now shuttling back and forth by the US team.''
The relief at some movement at last was evident too in Russian
reaction to the accord. Moscow's top negotiator at the Geneva talks
hailed the outcome as an important step forward but said Russia was
worried Nato's continuing bombing raids might jeopardise the progress.
First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov spoke of ''important
results'' achieved. ''We can say the practical realisation of the
Contact Group peace plan has begun,'' Mr Ivanov said. But he added that
the Russian delegation had told the meeting the Nato bombing could put
this at risk.
The foreign minister of former Yugoslavia, Mr Milan Milutinovic, said
the peace deal should satisfy the Bosnian Serbs.
''Of course we and they have to be very satisfied with what happened
today,'' Mr Milutinovic told reporters. He pointed in particular to the
recognition for the Republika Srpska, the Bosnian Serb entity in the
newly-defined Bosnia-Herzegovina.
''That is what all this was about. They are now treated equally and
from now on everything ought be easier,'' said Mr Milutinovic.
The Bosnian Serbs have complained they were not being given equal
treatment along with the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo.
Mr Milutinovic, whose government embraces the rump Yugoslavia made up
of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro, said he had had ''many
problems'' convincing the Bosnian Serbs that the deal they were getting
was a good one.
''After the first phase they were furious. So I had a problem to
quieten them down, to make them see that they were finally in Europe.''
The foreign minister also revealed his own government's apprehension
about the Eastern Slavonian issue, which was not resolved, saying it was
Yugoslavia's ''bottom line''.
He also rejected the notion that Belgrade had ambitions to create a
so-called Greater Serbia. ''It is not in our interest to have Greater
Serbia, there are too many of us already with all the new refugees,'' he
said.
That will come as a relief to Bosnia's leaders who also face possible
criticism at home.
President Alija Izetbegovic, in an apparent attempt to reassure his
followers, insisted he would not be giving up any land.
Mr Izetbegovic said his government had negotiated the Geneva agreement
on a single principle: ''We only have one condition which is to preserve
Bosnia as a whole, sovereign and independent country, a member of the
United Nations, and preserving conditions for its reintegration.'' --

THE French Government, anxious not to appear ruffled, had, until
Thursday evening, left the recent wave of terrorist bombings in the
hands of Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre.
All that has changed. By planting a primitive explosive device outside
a Jewish school in the east end of Lyon on Thursday afternoon, the
terrorists have thrown Government reaction into top gear.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe, with President Jaques Chirac looking over
his shoulder, is now in charge of the dossier.
The bomb exploded a few minutes before children left school and the
toll -- 14 injured, one seriously -- could have been a massacre.
By singling out Jewish schoolchildren as targets, the bombers have
signalled to the Government that they can and will sink to even lower
levels.
In an emergency meeting on Thursday night the Government brought in a
security plan called Vigipirate.
Drawn up during the Gulf War to deal with the eventuality of terrorist
attacks, it provides for extensive army and police surveillance of
public buildings and of individuals.
Yesterday morning, Education Minister Francois Bayrou announced, in
addition, special security measures would be introduced in French
schools.
The jittery feeling in Paris is uncanny. The city's wastepaper baskets
have all been sealed up, like the rubbish bins in the Metro, where
posters warn you to keep luggage with you at all times.
Police in combat gear patrol in groups of three. Security men in
stores search bags. Left luggage offices in stations and airports are
locked up, gendarmes carry out numerous spot checks on motorists and
silly scares are regular.
The fundamental question of who is carrying out the bombings remains
unanswered. No-one has claimed responsibility and no shred of proof,
officially at least, designates a guilty party. The police appear
helpless.
For more than a year they have been cracking down on suspected Islamic
fundamentalists and seizing stocks of arms and ammunition.
Despite this, police have not bagged a single serious suspect. To add
to their humiliation, efforts to extradite an Islamic extremist from
Sweden foundered after Swedish police determined the suspect had solid
alibis and refused to comply with the French demand.
The press and therefore public opinion assumes that the GIA, one of
the armed branches of the nebulous FIS (Islamic salvation front),
heavily involved in the murderous Algerian civil war, is behind the
Paris bombings.
It is tempting to suppose that demands are being made of the French
Government, in exchange for which the bombings will stop. It is tempting
therefore to think the French government knows more about who is
responsible than it is letting on.
For the time being, however, we are merely being fed pious expressions
of outrage and virile determination to hunt them, whoever they are, to
the ends of the earth.
* Soldiers armed with rifles took up positions under the Eiffel Tower
and at two other sites in Paris yesterday to help stem the wave of bomb
attacks.
''Small units have indeed been positioned at the Eiffel Tower, at the
top of the Champs Elysees Avenue under the Arc de Triomphe and at the
heliport at Issy-les-Moulinaux,'' an army spokesman said.
The total number of troops so far deployed numbered about the strength
of a company, or about 120 men, the spokesman said. French television
said about 500 would be deployed by nightfall.

Beijing
A BOBBING wave of brollies washed over the mud of Huairou as the
Women's Forum wrapped up for the decade and possibly forever.
Thousands of women from around the world came to this country town in
China to represent their non-governmental organisations and be the
advance party for the UN Fourth World Conference on Women.
They were rained on almost every day but the weather did not dampen
the enthusiasm or the spirit of those who were the spokeswomen for
countless thousands at home.
''I'm beginning to get my sea legs,'' said Wendy Eggleton of
Australia. ''But I'm ready to finish now. This event has made me realise
how lucky I am to live in a democratic system.''
Sana Sadollah, who is Kurdish but has been living in Scotland and
works for the Scottish Refugee Council in Edinburgh, was also trying to
manipulate the mud of Huairou.
''We Kurdish women in the NGO Forum are deeply concerned about the
fate of our Kurdish sisters in Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Syria, and elsewhere.
''Escalating violence, wars, internal conflicts, and vast human rights
abuses are causing deep distress and suffering.''
Travelling at her own expense to China, Ms Sadolla took direct action
and had a meeting with the UN Commissioner on Human Rights.
At the Peace Tent, where some of the most successful workshops were
held, Nancy McClintock from the Women's International League for Peace
and Freedom, said: ''It is clear there are common issues across the
globe. Violence against women is universal.
''It will not end till there is parity between women and men at all
levels of government. And the only way we can fund our social strategies
is if we are determined to stop putting our money on buying arms and
spend it on those social areas we women want.
''But that will only happen if people go away from here and continue
to pressure their governments. We have to shout louder and keep on
moving forward.''

Washington
RESEARCHERS have identified an abnormality in brain chemistry that may
help explain why thousands of children around the world die in their
sleep every year.
The discovery by scientists studying sudden infant death syndrome
appears to pinpoint a chemical defect in a part of the brain stem
believed to control breathing during sleep.
Dr Hannah C. Kinney, a neuropathologist at Children's Hospital in
Boston, headed the team conducting the study.
The researchers emphasized the finding ''does not necessarily point to
any single cause of SIDS'' because the precise function of that part of
the brain stem isn't known.
But Dr Kinney told the Los Angeles Times researchers might eventually
develop ''drugs or some other therapy'' to correct the problem.

MORE than half the work of a crime thriller -- Couch Potato means one
in which the criminal is the hero -- is about making you like the
criminal. As anyone who's ever had traffic with real bad guys knows, and
as anyone with sense could guess, they're about as likable as a
Rottweiler in a mother-and-baby ward; so making the bad guy the good guy
can't be the easiest trick in the book. But when the trick is pulled
well, it makes great movies.
One of the oldest tricks is to make the hero a victim of circumstance,
which worked just dandy for Paul Muni in I am a Fugitive from a Chain
Gang and again, 60 years later, for Al Pacino in Carlito's Way. Or,
given the right actor, you can make him so bung-full of guts and
gallusness that his personality just sweeps you along, like James Cagney
in The Roaring Twenties.
You can make him vulnerable and soft-centred like Humphrey Bogart (Roy
''Mad Dog'' Earle -- a name to die for, as indeed he did) in The High
Sierra, or fey and fated like John Dall in Gun Crazy, or . . . well, you
get the idea. But there was always, until very recently, one kind of bad
guy who had to stay a bad guy all the way through: the hit man, the
cold-blooded killer who murders for pay.
Luc Besson's swooningly romantic New York mayhem tragedy Leon (rental,
cert 18) is only the second mainstream film to crash that sympathy
barrier. Quentin Tarantino did it first in Pulp Fiction by making
Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield so super-cool and groovy; Besson does it
by making murder just another dirty job that someone's gotta do -- his
eponymous hero actually refers to himself as ''a cleaner''. Both films
create an alternative world where the big rules are dead but the
everyday stuff like trust, friendship, and honour still applies. Morally
dodgy? Sure, but that's entertainment.
When he's at work, Leon (Jean Reno) is an almost supernaturally
pitiless and inescapable nemesis, like the 1930s French pulp hero
Fantomas, but off duty he's a simple, kindly Italian immigrant who
lavishes affection on a potted plant and watches old Gene Kelly
musicals. One day he's sitting at home oiling his guns -- as you do --
when the deeply nefarious family next door is all but wiped out in a
cocaine-dusted bloodbath by ultra-evil rogue cop Stansfield (Gary
Oldman) and his goons.
More or less by accident, Leon saves the life of sole survivor
Mathilde (Natalie Portman), a sulky 12-year-old waif who had been her
family's Cinderella girl. (''Is life always this hard, or just when
you're a kid?'' she asks him earlier in the film. ''Yes,'' he says.
''It's always this hard'').
As he's saved her life, he's stuck with her, and there grows up
between them a moving, funny, and bizarrely innocent father-and-daughter
relationship that culminates in Leon deciding to avenge her little
brother, the only one in the family she loved, by killing Stansfield and
his men. From here on in, things get heavy.
The story could almost be that of The Specialist, the Sylvester
Stallone/Sharon Stone flop that was -- no contest -- the worst
big-stars-big-budget movie of the past 12 months. But what lifts Leon
into a far higher league is Luc Besson's ability to give his characters
and their situation the weight of tragedy, backed up by bravura star
performances and a swooping, soaring camera style that makes the big
set-piece scenes a elegantly fluid ballet of death. To paraphrase the
publicity slogan for Wayne's World: you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll
feel slightly queasy. And -- says Couch Potato -- you'll fall in love.

EDMUND WILSON: A BIOGRAPHY. Jeffry Meyers Constable, #20 (pp554).
ARGUABLY the finest critics of this century were poets and old pals
Eliot and Pound. Eliot was aloof and objective as a critic whereas Pound
was savage and subjective. Edmund Wilson (1895-1972) admired Eliot -- he
called The Waste Land ''the most considerable poem of any length yet
produced by an American poet'' -- and wanted to emulate his critical
objectivity. Wilson disliked Pound -- he called the poet ''a writer at
second-hand who lives almost exclusively on other people's literature''
-- and wanted to avoid his critical subjectivity. However, Wilson always
sounded more like Pound than Eliot. Like Pound, Wilson was famous for
his feuds.
Wilson had a feud with Evelyn Waugh. To Wilson, Waugh's Brideshead
Revisited was an appalling apology for the Catholic faith while The
Loved One revealed the ridiculous characters were ''more sensible and
less absurd than the priest-guided Evelyn Waugh''. Asked by an
interviewer if Wilson's comments had hurt him, Waugh replied with
rhetorical questions: ''Is he American? I don't think what they have to
say is of much interest, do you?'' Waugh was well aware of Wilson's
origins as he had previously described him as an ''insignificant Yank''.
Wilson had an even more ferocious feud with his close friend Vladimir
Nabokov. Appropriately the feud was over Nabokov's translation of
Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, a poem about an impulsive character who kills a
close friend in a duel. Nabokov's translation was ploddingly prosaic so
Wilson criticised its ''bald and awkward language''. And Nabokov reacted
by claiming that Wilson was ''incapable of comprehending the mechanism
of verse -- either Russian or English''. Characteristically, in his last
letter to Nabokov -- who, hearing his old friend was ill with heart
disease in 1971, had recalled ''the thrill of our friendship'' -- Wilson
warned he was revising his review of Eugene Onegin by way of ''citing a
few more of your ineptitudes''.
Wilson was forever falling out with the men and women in his life. A
master of the craft of polemical criticism he was also a monster
according to his third wife Mary McCarthy who criticised him in several
novels -- for instance in The Groves of Academe (1952) Wilson appears as
Henry Mulcahy, a ''soft-bellied, lisping man . . . intermittently aware
of personal unattractiveness that emanated from him like a miasma''.
Jeffrey Meyers comes to the defence of Wilson in this fascinating
biography, pointing out that Wilson's feuds were with folk who loved
feuding and suggesting Wilson's marriage to McCarthy was not the union
of a beast and a beauty but a literary partnership that worked well in
the beginning: ''She did love Wilson, married him willingly and was, at
least at first, quite happy with him.'' She reckoned she would never
have written fiction without the facts of his life.
McCarthy accused Wilson of being a domestic tyrant who beat her up and
battered her emotionally. She had a nervous breakdown and blamed it on
Wilson. Meyers has a problem in explaining this away but does his best
when commenting on an alleged assault of June 8, 1938: ''Mary was the
only witness to the beating, which Wilson firmly denied . . . Wilson was
capable of violence when he was drunk. But he was not drunk [on the]
morning when he allegedly beat her, and there is no evidence that he
ever struck any other wife or girlfriend (though he did slap Jean
Gorman).''
This will not do. Wilson was extremely drunk the night before the
alleged assault so on the morning after he was still drunk as drink
takes more than a day to go out of the system. He had hit Jean Gorman
(the wife of Joyce's first biographer, Herbert Gorman) not once but
twice and this after a literary argument. Meyers finds it difficult to
accept the horrific aspects of Wilson's personality because he believes
Wilson was the ''most intelligent and most cosmopolitan figure in
American literature'' and so above criticism as a commentator rather
than beneath contempt as a character.
Biographers believe what they want to believe. Obviously Meyers wants
to believe McCarthy was fantasising when she gave her account of her
marriage to Wilson: ''Directly after our marriage I discovered that he
was addicted to drink and our life together became a series of violent
episodes. After I became pregnant, he began beating me with his fists,
he would kick me out of bed and again when I was on the floor.'' If
McCarthy was telling the truth then Wilson was not only a combative
critic. He was a creep.
Son of a neurotic father and a disturbed mother who beat him with a
silver-backed brush, Wilson studied at Princeton then served in a
military hospital in France in the First World War. His experience of
war made him a pacifist though he was unable to find peace in himself. A
successful literary journalist -- managing editor of Vanity Fair,
associate editor of the New Republic -- he had a nervous breakdown in
1929 and was treated with electric shocks and dosed with paraldehyde. He
was depressed because he could not make it as a creative writer though
he was widely respected for his criticism.
Wilson did write such works of fiction as I Thought of Daisy (1929)
and Memoirs of Hecate County (1946) but his reputation rests on his
critical works: Axel's Castle (1931), To the Finland Station (1940), The
Wound and the Bow (1941) and so on. Influenced by Marx and Freud, he
attempted to relate literature to his own life as a member of the Lost
Generation -- or, as Thurber called it, the Generation That Stayed Up
All Night.
Meyers admires Wilson as ''the most distinguished American man of
letters in the twentieth century''. That is a case of convenient
amnesia, given the achievements of Eliot and Pound who were positively
creative as well as critical.

HITCHCOCK ON HITCHCOCK
Edited by Sidney Gottlieb
Faber, #14.99 (pp339).
WHAT on earth did Alfred and Alma Hitchcock get up to with Nita Naldi
in Paris on the first day of their honeymoon? It is typical of
Hitchcock, always the master of suspense, that he refuses to say. The
disclosure is the punch line to an article he wrote in 1937 for the News
Chronicle about the making of his second film set in Kentucky about a
simple, homely schoolmarm played by Naldi who, as he notes was
''glamorous, dark, Latin, Junoesque, slinky, with slanting eyes,
four-inch heels, nails like a mandarin's, and a black dog to match her
black swathed dress''.
But that is movies for you. For some reason they shot it in Munich. At
the climax Nita turned on some Kentucky farmers who were running her out
of town and revealed what she thought of them. In silent films dialogue
was written only for close-ups so Hitchock told her ''Give them all
you've got.'' Nita obliged -- in English, Italian, American, Bowery,
Park Avenue and, for all he knew, Double Dutch. At the end the German
crew, who had not understood a word, burst into spontaneous applause.
That too is movies for you.
Nothing beats a film maker talking about his craft. Critics can
analyse, lecturers on film studies can theorise, but only the
practitioners can explain what they did and why. Hitchock gave many
interviews, but he also wrote extensively about the cinema and this
collection by Professor Sidney Gottlieb brings his newspaper and
magazine articles together for the first time. Language has changed
since he wrote them and it is amusing to note how he is unconsciously
spot on writing about Rope in which John Dall and Farley Granger murder
a college friend, put his body in a trunk, and then hold a party using
the trunk as a table. Hitchcock notes that everyone was ''gay and
charming''.
Writing in 1949 about fear and suspense, which he had made his
speciality, he argued the reason people enjoyed being made to feel
afraid in the cinema was they knew the price would not be paid. The
bandsaw would never reach its intended target, it would break down or
the hero arrive in time. ''Fear and fear not, that is the essence of
melodrama,'' he wrote.''Fear: the saw may dismember the ingenue. Fear
not: it won't.''
On the screen terror is induced by surprise, suspense by forwarning,
he wrote in essay on The Enjoyment of Fear. The latter occurs when the
audience know something is about to happen the characters do not know,
and then are made to wait for it to occur. Like a roller coaster ride it
must appear as terrifying as possible, but in reality be completely
safe.
He admits to having once broken the rule about not bringing a
character, with whom the audience has identified, to a disastrous end.
In Sabotage a small boy, with whom the audience had been encouraged to
fall in love, is sent round London unwittingly carrying a time bomb in a
can of film. Hitchcock blew him up along with several other passengers
on the bus he happened to be riding. Had the explosion come as a
surprise the audience would not have been so outraged, but the audience
knew about the bomb and was of the opinion that Hitchock should have
been riding next to the boy, preferably on the seat he placed it on.
Rich in stories, full of insights, Professor Gottlieb's book is a
valuable addition to Faber's series of directors on directors.

Fish, musician and singer, tells ANN DONALD about his favourite
reading matter.
* I PICKED up Duncan McLean's Bunker Man at the airport. I hadn't read
anything of his before and this was one really strange book but it made
me want to read more.
It starts off in a humdrum way -- all about this school janitor,
repartee with his colleagues, his relationship with his wife. And then
suddenly it takes a twist and turns into a very macabre comedy. The
young janitor becomes obsessed with an old man living in a Second World
War II bunker and with trying to protect the school kids from this guy
who is flashing in the woods. This guy is really the janitor's alter ego
and shows what he could have become if he had taken another path in
life.
About two thirds of the way through I started to feel very
uncomfortable because I started to recognise these feelings the
principal character was going through. The ending is slightly
disappointing but the rest of the book is so good that it more than
makes up for it.
The other book is The Day After Tomorrow by Alan Folsom which again
was riveting. It's about an American doctor who goes to a conference in
Geneva, has an affair, becomes infatuated with the woman and follows her
back to Paris. Trying to find her he walks into a cafe and by chance
spots the guy who murdered his father when he -- the American -- was
only a boy of ten. He attacks the murderer, who escapes and that
triggers a whole series of events.
It's a classic political thriller where the plot never slackens and
something is happening all the time.

The Herald Book of The Old Firm. Edited by Chris Boyce Canongate.
NOT another book on the Old Firm? Well, yes, it is another book
exclusively about Celtic and Rangers, but this one is a bit special -- a
one-off, and a must for anyone interested in the history of Scotland's
two most powerful and successful clubs.
I now hear you saying: ''Well, you would say that, wouldn't you? After
all, The Herald has a hefty hand in the project.''
And yes, The Herald does have a strong connection with the
publication, and indeed it is something of which we are quite proud.
This book is a comprehensive history of every Old Firm match played
since the Second World War, and we have opened up our superb archives to
help you capture the mood, the passion and the excitement of each era,
from the forties to the nineties.
The book tells of the triumphs for one side which were tragedy for the
other.
There are complete match reports from the quality football writers who
have served the then Glasgow Herald, which is now, of course, simply The
Herald. Stunning pictures will bring back great footballing memories --
just like the one shown in which the late Davie Cooper and Danny McGrain
express all the commitment which typifies an Old Firm game. Now you may
have some idea of why we think the project is that bit special.
Celtic fans will, no doubt, want to recapture matches such as the
League Cup final of 1957 when the Parkhead side beat Rangers 7-1 at
Hampden with Billy McPhail notching a hat trick. There was also another
memorable triumph for Celtic in 1979 when, in what was a league
championship decider, they beat Rangers 4-2 at Parkhead.
Rangers fans will wish to capture the ecstasy of beating Celtic in the
Scottish Cup finals of 1966 (against all the odds) and the centenary
final of 1973. Others will recall the Ally McCoist hat trick in a 3-2
League Cup final triumph, or the 5-1 and 4-1 wins over Celtic in league
matches at Ibrox during the 1988-89 season.
For my own part, I was pleased to be asked to contribute a modest part
to the production. Naming your 25 best players from each side of the Old
Firm over the last 50 years is not an easy task. However, I did so, and
provided profiles of them.
No doubt many of you will disagree with my choice and point out
serious omissions. Please, don't write or phone. Instead, just try it
yourself. Then you will appreciate how hard it is to choose between one
magnificent player and another.
* If you want to play an important part in the production, there is
still time. You can get your name on the roll of honour for sponsors at
the front of the book -- there will be a separate list for each set of
supporters.
Hundreds have already taken up this pre-publication offer which allows
you to buy the hardback at #17.50, plus #2.00 postage.
Please see page  6 of The Herald for full details and our special
reader offer.

RELIGHTING THE PARAFFIN LAMP
George Mackay Brown
Winter Tales
John Murray
#15.99
IN ONE of the stories in George Mackay Brown's new collection, Winter
Tales, an old man lives ''entirely in the past. He disliked all the
fruits of progress that his fellow-islanders were beginning to splurge
in: motorcars, wireless sets, gramophones, bakehouse bread, Edinburgh
beer.''
When electricity comes to the island the old man refuses to have it
installed in his house. But when he falls ill and is taken to hospital
in Kirkwall, the minister arranges for electric light in his house.
On the old man's return home the minister finds him reading The
Pilgrim's Progress by the dim light of his paraffin lamp. ''He said that
was a very handy thing, the electric light. He could see by it to fill
his old lamp, and trim the wick, and light it with a wisp of straw from
the fire.''
This story, The Paraffin Lamp, seems to be a metaphor for Mackay
Brown's own power source. He has refused steadfastly to run the neural
cables of modernity into his creative consciousness. His fiction is set
in the Orcadian past, often back to the time of the occupying Vikings.
I see striking similarities between the traditions of the Caribbean,
the Orkney and Shetland Isles, and the Hebrides. They are archipelagos,
where men have been as much at home on the sea as onland. Stories --
many of them supernatural -- as well as cargoes have been taken from
island to island, to be extended and usually enriched by each successive
narrator until the epic form is reached.
Gabriel Garcia Marquez has made himself the greatest master of the
magic realism tale, based on the oral tradition. Given our inheritance
of ballads and tales told over fires and in the cabins of boats, the
magic realism tradition should have evolved in Scotland, because it
could be said to have had its origins in Scotland, in the epic poems of
James ''Ossian'' Macpherson.
The lack of a magic realism genre in Scottish fiction is due to
several factors. Tale bearers -- speaking Scots and Gaelic, primarily --
migrated to the cities and abroad, where distinct oral traditions
disappeared in the multicultural mix. For those who remained in the
rural areas and the islands, and wanted to express themselves through
writing, there has been the problem of how to update the traditional
tale, to make it appealing and relevant in the modern world.
Prose writers from the Western Isles have not solved this problem,
because of the cold shadow cast by Calvinism; and Mackay Brown from the
Northern Islands has not solved the problem, because the Catholicism to
which he converted is a controlling factor in his writing, with ritual
and symbol predominating.
Mackay Brown, who is in his seventies now, must be admired for a
lifetime's steadfastness and loyalty to his tradition. But to whom can
the young Orcadian writer look in searching for a prose style that will
react to the changing world? There is no one.  Like many characters in
his stories -- and like Mackay Brown himself -- the young writer is on
his own, and it is too tempting to light the paraffin lamp and retell
the old tale, than to press the switch for modern illumination, at the
same time drawing power from the past.

SONGS IN ORDINARY TIME
Mary McGarry Morris
Forth Estate, #15.99
* THIS is a bulky, overwritten book which groans for an editor who
could have teased these characters and their stories away from the text,
who could have unified the various strands and themes and treated the
text as a working document rather than a finished piece.
It calls for someone with the readers' interests rather than the
writer in mind, who could have provided helpful details such as chapters
and asked how much of the considerable bulk of information was
necessary.
The lack of such attention means the book is hopelessly out of
control. It carries enough material for at least two other novels. The
main problem is overcrowding. Stories and ideas either fade or disappear
and the whole is less than the sum of its parts. The text simply runs
out of energy, except towards the end, where, with the finishing post
obviously in view, Mary McGarry Morris tries to pull things together and
reassure her readers, thereby neatly encapsulating one of the book's
main problems -- everybody has more than one function.
There are no walk-on parts. Everyone is a star which means there is
little variation or contrast. As they jostle for attention, their
stories freeze any action, leaving a thread of connected incidents and a
cast of characters who live in the same place and know each other rather
than an integrated hole. There are no telling details. Adjectives are
almost the sole means of description.
We begin with a death. It is 1960 in Atkinso, Vermont. Judge Henry
Clay sits at the second floor window of the big brown Mainstreet
Boardinghouse. Joey Seldon, the blind man who sells popcorn and soda
from this leased stand on the corner of the park, is in position. On the
opposite corner, three dark men and a tall man in a white suit and straw
hat sit in a car waiting for the lights to change. The tall man suddenly
throws the back door open and runs down the street as the car screeches
round the corner after him.
A curtain blows across the judge's face. Moments later May Mayo, a
tiny women with bluish, white hair backs into the room with two stemmed
glasses of orange juice on a mahogany tray. May and her sister Claire
run the Boardinghouse. May was the judge's lover and finds it difficult
to accept his death. ''Summer's finally here,'' she tells his corpse.
And so it continues, with everyone getting more or less the same
attention and therefore making the same impression, which leaves the
reader with little or nothing to bring to the story, except time.
The text eventually focuses on the Formoyle family, though we don't
meet the linchpin, Marie, mother of Benjy, Norm, and Alice, until the
novel is well underway. Benjy has witnessed a murder in the woods, while
Marie's alcoholic husband and the subsequent divorce have taken their
toll. She needs an antedote, and Omar Duvall seems to fit the bill, but
he's a conman and as he wheedles his way into the family home and
Marie's affections, only Benjy knows his secret.
But Marie's happiness means more to Benjy than the truth. He forms a
tentative alliance with Duvall, while sister Alice and brother Norm
confront the rogue at every turn. Alice forms a liaison with Father Joe
Gannon, the town pries which evokes real warth and tenderness,
contrasting with the doomed affair between Marie and Omar and Benjy's
confusion, which could easily have been books on their own.
Mary McGarry Morris likes Marie and paints for us in many ways a
skillfull portrait of a woman at the end of their tether, hard on the
outside while yearning for warmth and affection. Credibility is severely
tested by the notion of this powerful character falling for someone as
transparent as Omar and what little suspense this generates is dispersed
by language which never equals it its task. Flat and stilted except, for
occasional lapses until lyricism over the weather or landscape, these
attempts to soar end in a belly flop as the author reminds us what's
happening elsewhere or presses home another detail she feels we need to
know.

Wensley Clarkson. QUENTIN TARANTINO: Shooting From The Hip (Piatkus,
#10.99).
WHEN the guy who used to be your best friend (Roger Avary, co-writer
of Pulp Fiction) tells your biographer that ''If Quentin hadn't made it
in the film business, it's very likely he'd have ended up a serial
killer'', you know you've made it as a bona-fide cult film star.
Required reading for all Taranteenies, Wensley Clarkson's life of the
wild-child auteur of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction is full of
fascinating insights into Tarantino's weird childhood, his adolescence
as the all-time movie geek who substituted watching movies for living,
and his adulthood as the director-thief who ripped off 100 old movies to
make two great movies of his own. He's nuts, of course -- but brilliant
with it.
Ray Davies. X-RAY: The Unauthorised Autobiography (Penguin, #6.99).
FOR a book called X-Ray, it's remarkable how little of himself Ray
Davies, founder of The Kinks and composer of some of the greatest
British pop songs ever written (Waterloo Sunset, Days, Sunny Afternoon)
actually reveals in this spookily detached third-person autobiography.
Best bits are the portraits of the London pop scene circa 1965, with its
wideboy-aristocrat Mayfair managers, and the gloomy road diaries of how
it felt to be a supremely talented songwriter making a living with a
troupe of musical bricklayers. Although The Kinks are still on the go,
X-Ray spends almost all its time on the period 1965-1972, which maybe
accounts for its permeating sadness. Twenty years is a long time to
decline in.
Randall Wallace. BRAVEHEART (Signet, #4.99).
SCREENWRITER of the film Braveheart, American writer Randall Wallace
has novelised his William Wallace epic into a quaintly enjoyable
cod-historical swashbuckler whose charm lies mostly in its achingly
sincere and guileless badness. Englishmen's heads get split ''like pecan
nuts''; thirteenth-century Scots use words like ain't and gonna; and
several large-sized liberties get taken with historical facts -- the
back-jacket blurb, for example, seems to think that Wallace was present
at Bannockburn. The author's prefatory verses give the flavour: So let
us drink to Scotland fair/ Its sorrow and its solace/ And lift our
glasses in the air/ To you and William Wallace!
Steven Fielding, Peter Thompson, and Nick Tiratsoo. ''England
Arise!'': The Labour Party And Popular Politics In 1940s Britain
(Manchester University Press, #12.99).
ACADEMIC, but interesting to anyone concerned about the past and
future of the Labour Party and socialism, this controversially
revisionist study lays the blame for the post-war failure of the British
left on the British people themselves, who (the authors say) were never
truly converted to the moral and ethical vision summed up by the Labour
Party poster The Good Neighbour Votes Labour. It's a pessimistic
analysis, but one that crops up again and again in socialist thinking:
as Bertolt Brecht says, sometimes it's necessary to depose the old
masses and get a new lot in.
Barry E Zimmerman and David J Zimmerman. WHY NOTHING CAN TRAVEL FASTER
THAN LIGHT And Other Scientific Curiosities (Cassell, #9.99).
IF A Brief History of Time made your head ache, try this more
realistically targeted collection of 30 essays in popular science on for
size. The Zimmerman brothers are less concerned to explain the universe
than to explain some of its more interesting and mostly down-to-earth
features, like global warming and evolution, while dabbling accessibly
in the shallower waters of real brain-busters like quantum physics and
how the universe began. Engagingly written, from a liberal-humanist
standpoint, this is a delightful and genuinely informative book in the
tradition of Martin Gardner and J B S Haldane.

THE GIRL WITH THE MILLON DOLLAR LEGS, Tom McGee, Vestal Press, #14.99
Grable, the girl with the million-dollar legs, belongs to Hollywood
legend as the hottest property of those years when her glamorous outline
adorned many a wartime airplane.
Beyond the legend, however, lies another fascinating tale of how a
starry-eyed lad from the Glasgow Gorbals tracked her down, gained her
friendship -- and has just become the author of this highly readable
biography.
One American critic has expressed surprise that it was left to a
Scotsman to come up with the definitive story of one of Hollywood's
greatest.
All the more credit to Tom McGee, the Glasgow newspaper copy-taker
whose perseverance has finally brought him the reward he deserves. As
the book hits Britain, where it was rejected by more than 50 publishers,
the news from America is that the initial print is completely sold out.
Tom McGee's example is worth a study. Growing up in Naburn Street, son
of a grocer, the boy would find his way through wartime blackout to
local cinemas like the Crown, Palace, and Paragon.
And it was there that he fell under the spell of the song-and-dance
lady whose contemporaries included Deanna Durbin, Rita Hayworth, and
Dorothy Lamour. For Tom there was no contest.
''My father used to tease me about saying that one day I would marry
Betty Grable,'' he now recalls. ''But from the time my mother took me to
the Paragon to see Coney Island the screen lit up and my world was
changed for ever.''
On a family holiday in Ayr, he sent Betty a postcard of the Burns
statue and back came a picture of his idol. It was the beginning of a
remarkable correspondence which told not only of the perseverance of Tom
McGee but of the trusting nature and good judgment of Grable herself.
Film stars have to be wary of worshippers and, with a fan-mail which
reached 90,000 a month, she was not short of attention. But Tom's name
gained an advantage because, in Sweet Rosie O'Grady, Betty Grable is
pursued by a journalist called McGee.
It all came to fruition in 1969 when the Hollywood star paid her very
first visit to Britain. Her new musical, The Piecefull Palace (later
re-named Belle Starr) was to have its premiere in . . . where better
than the old Glasgow Alhambra?
At last, Tom McGee would have a chance to look beyond the celluloid at
the actual outline of Betty Grable. As a copy-taker in this Albion
Street building, he didn't have a journalist's privilege but he did go
along to wait respectfully at the Alhambra press conference.
''I just hovered in the background until I plucked up courage to speak
to her,'' he recalls. ''As I handed her a letter she had written to me,
she scanned it and exclaimed 'McGee!' That warm smile came over her face
and we were instant friends.''
Tom's sincerity struck home at once and her kindness to the young
Glaswegian from that point onwards is a tribute to a Hollywood great.
''The show was here for three weeks and I was going to be there every
night,'' he says. ''Betty was staying at the Central Hotel and we became
such friends that she allowed me not only to walk her from the hotel to
the theatre but to sit in her dressing-room as she was being made up.''
When she discovered that Tom was paying his way in each evening she
quickly arranged complimentary tickets -- and welcomed him back after
the show.
They talked about her life, her loves, her career and Tom went home
each night to put it all roughly on paper. Belle Starr was one of Betty
Grable's less fortunate choices but the way she kicked her shapely legs
-- she was by now a grandmother -- sang in an increasingly husky voice
and swaggered in feathers and spangles ensured that Glasgow would
overlook the show's deficiencies.
At the final curtain the audience was on its feet and Miss Grable,
controlling her tears, told them: ''I have played many theatres all over
the United States and I must honestly say that I have never had a
welcome like this. It has been the highlight of my career.''
When the show went to London, Tom McGee took time off, stayed with an
aunt in Chelsea and resumed his pursuit of Grable's story. Her luxury
Mayfair apartment was across the landing from that of Margaret, Duchess
of Argyll, and it was here that he continued his interviews.
''I had no notes, no tape-recorder,'' he recalls. ''I was just blessed
with a good memory. She was very good with those interviews, even
prompting me to ask questions.''
It all went down on paper and before Betty left for home Tom joked
that he had enough material for a biography.
Betty laughed: ''Honey, not until I'm dead and buried.''
The story Tom was building into a biography was the not unfamiliar one
of a pushy mother who up-tailed from the family home in St Louis,
Missouri, and took little Betty to live in Hollywood. By 14, the girl
was a line captain in the famous Busby Berkeley spectaculars. By 20 she
was married to former child actor Jackie Coogan, a short-lived union
after which she had escorts like Victor Mature, George Raft, Tyrone
Power, and clarinetist Artie Shaw.
But it was famous trumpeter and band leader Harry James who became the
real love of her life and by whom she had two daughters, even though
that marriage too came unstuck, through Harry's drinking, gambling and
womanising.
At 20th Century Fox they had bought the story of Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes specifically for Betty Grable. But the young Marilyn Monroe had
now appeared to edge Betty out of the part. That hurt deeply, even if
she did then line up with Marilyn and Lauren Bacall in How to Marry a
Millionaire.
At the 1972 Oscar ceremony Jack Lemmon introduced Betty Grable to make
one of the presentations. That she didn't feel well that night was the
first sign that heavy smoking had taken its toll.
Soon she lay dying of lung cancer at St John's Hospital, Santa Monica,
and the privileged few who were allowed to put through telephone calls
included Tom McGee from Glasgow, Scotland.
''I spoke to her just three weeks before she finally died, on July 2,
1973,'' said Tom, remembering his saddest day.
In 1975, he went to work in Saudi Arabia, taking those Grable notes
which he would now seek to shape into biography. But the research was
far from over.
He flew to America and stage-doored appropriate stars to convince them
that he was Betty's friend, producing her letters and the photo of them
both together. People like Mitzi Gaynor, Alice Faye and not least Jack
Lemmon responded with great co-operation and in time the biography was
completed.
But British publishers were not interested. After 50 or more
rejections, a disheartened Tom put his manuscript in a drawer.
Meanwhile, two books on the star did her scant justice and the real
biography was still awaited. It was film star Alice Faye who not only
wrote his foreword but found Tom an American agent -- and the biography
of Betty Grable is now a reality.
Back working in this Albion Street building as a copy-taker, Tom McGee
has dedicated the book to his 82-year-old mother Mamie, who lives with
him on Glasgow's South Side and who introduced him to his Hollywood idol
at the old Paragon so many years ago.
Betty Grable would have been proud of them both.

The Citizen's Theatre is celebrating 50 years in its Gorbals home. Jan
MacDonald reflects on how this unlikely venture grew in international
stature and remembers some of the cataclysmic events along the way
The Citizens' was transformed into the ''house of illusions'' which
has thrilled and outraged audiences throughout the last two and a half
decades
THE first play I saw at the Citizens' Theatre was The Taming of the
Shrew. I was 11 years old and my mother, anxious to encourage my
literary interests yet reluctant to fan my growing ambition to pursue a
theatrical career, took me to a cold and unglamorous November matinee.
Not for a moment was I put off. Saturday matinees at the Citizens'
became a regular feature of my teenage years. I saw everything from The
Burning Glass to Bell, Book and Candle, from Mary Rose to Hamlet. We
paid ninepence for a seat in the ''gods'' and never moaned, as some
current patrons do, about the uncomfortable seats. In those days, as
undiscriminating as I was addicted, I was not at all concerned about who
was designing or directing, and the controversies already raging about
how ''Scottish'' the Citz should be passed me by.
I should say that, apart from my magical Saturday afternoons straight
from the Junior Course at RSAMD, I was also taken by my school to the
annual performances of Moliere's plays given in French by the Pamela
Stirling Players. At least I think they were all by Moliere. They
certainly had a daunting similarity to one another.
I became aware of a directorial team and an overall artistic strategy
during what came to be known as the ''reign of the Michaels'' (Meacham
and Blakemore) in the sixties, a period of the theatre's history that
has been underestimated, (by everyone except that assiduous historian Dr
Tony Paterson) eclipsed in part by the glitter of the Havergal regime.
Highlights were the premiere of A Day in the Death of Joe Egg and a
brilliant production of The Tempest, with Richard Kane as a menacingly
strange Ariel.
This period also saw the establishment of the Close Theatre Club, the
brainchild of Michael Goldberg, Chairman of the Board, where, if, as a
relatively impecunious assistant lecturer, I could not afford the rather
upmarket meals, I certainly did enjoy the chance to see plays by Genet,
Beckett and Albee that had not hitherto been part of the Glasgow
repertoire. (Remember there was no Tron, no Tramway, no CAA, no
Ramshorn, no Cottier in those far-off days!) To my eternal regret, I was
not present on the night of scandal and outrage when Charles Marowitz's
production of Dr Faustus was stopped by irate committee members because
the character of Sloth was portrayed as the Queen. That seems incredible
now. Thirty years is a long time in theatre and in the public
representation of the Royals.
A happy Close memory was the occasion of the first Department of Drama
Summer School in 1966 when I directed, with more courge than talent,
Strindberg's The Stranger set in a replica of the Willow Tearoom in
Sauchiehall Street.
The late sixties was a bad time at the Citz. Audiences dwindled and a
succession of artistic directors was sacked by the board almost before
they had disembarked from the train at Central Station. I never knew the
details of all the politicking, but I certainly regretted the departure
of Michael Meacham. However, help was at hand in the person of Giles
Havergal, who together with designer/director Philip Prowse and
dramatist/dramaturg Robert David MacDonald transformed the Citizens'
into that ''discotheque of a theatre'', that ''house of illusions''
which has thrilled, informed and, at times outraged audiences throughout
the last two and a half decades.
Theatre critics and historians often date the advent of the
triumvirate from the infamous all-male Hamlet, but, in fact the first
more conventional season included some excellent productions, The Milk
Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore with a splendidly decadent performance
from Constance Cummings and an elegant Heartbreak House with Edward Fox,
Thelma Barlow and Susan Engel. Unfortunately, however, these did not
reverse the downward trend in audience figures and so the policy neatly
encapsulated by Prowse as ''If they don't like what we do, we'll do what
we like!'' came into being. This radical U-turn could not have been
achieved without the support of the newly constituted board under the
lawyer and Labour politician, Bill Taylor.
I have to confess that I was not an instant convert. I did sit through
the whole of Hamlet which is more than can be said for my companions,
but my Pauline revelation came with Camille. Robert David MacDonald
presented in juxtaposition scenes from Verdi's La Traviata, Dumas's La
Dame aux camelias and the ''true'' story of the young Dumas and the
courtesan, Marie Duplessis. The ending in which the strains of Verdi and
the gloriously romantic collapse of the dying Marguerite into the arms
of Armand provided a telling comment on the realistic portrayal of the
actual death of Marie Duplessis, ''a whore spitting blood'' abandoned by
her lover.
This was not only a source of great intellectual pleasure in its
investigation of the nature of theatrical ''truth'' and everyday
''truth'' but it provided one of the most moving moments I have ever
experienced in the theatre. My companion, another supposedly hard-headed
female academic and I, after beginning my sniffing and surreptitiously
reaching for our tissues, ended the evening in floods of tears.
Like all converts I became fanatical, a staunch supporter of the
theatre of mirrors, blood and glitter that happily butchered the great
European classics to make a spectacle, an event, a meaningful
experience.
It is perhaps invidious to cite favourites -- but this is a personal
view. There was Chincilla, ostensibly about Diaghilev but actually about
artistic collaboration that held up a mirror to the Citizens' company
itself; A Waste of Time, from Proust's A la recherche du Temps, Perdue,
brilliantly directed and set by Prowse in six gilded picture frames that
problematized time, memory and the art of the theatre; Mrs Warren's
Profession, a return to Shaw's original manuscript that made a thesis
play into an almost tragic drama; Travels with my Aunt, Havergal's
elegant adaptation for four men (still travelling, that one) and Design
for Living, or maybe Semi-monde -- at any rate one of the Cowards, whose
puritan dandyism so well suits the company ethos.
Meanwhile back at the Close, the ambience had changed -- mirrors (yes,
mirrors again) edged in black, scarlet and gold covered the walls of the
club room. Those who would not have turned a hair at the
misrepresentation of a monarch were soon wallowing in the blood of The
Cenci, but, in fact the main house had itself become an experimental
stage and, with the abolition of censorship of the theatre in 1968, the
Close was less necessary as a venue for the avant-garde. Nevertheless,
after the fire of 1973, I missed it a great deal as a place to go on
Sunday evenings to read the newspapers and discourse on great issues in
politics and art.
It is also fair to say that it was on the Citizens' stage in the 1970s
that I saw some of the classics of Scottish theatre not, of course, by
the home team, but by 7:84 (Scotland) and the Edinburgh Lyceum Company.
It may seem strange that someone who became intoxicated by Camille
should also cite among the greatest productions she has ever seen The
Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil and The Bevellers, but, as
Chinchilla said, ''We must all pick up our culture where we can.''
It was some ten years after the arrival of the triumvirate that I
became more personally involved with the Citizens' both academically and
administratively. In 1979 I was asked to present a paper at an
international theatre conference in Venice and, as part of my
preparations, I sought interviews with the three directors. Giles was,
true to his alter-ego in Chinchilla, charming, articulate, informative.
I knew the other two less well and, somewhat apprehensively, I arranged
to meet them in Giles's flat.
I first talked to David MacDonald who poured me the largest whisky I
have ever drunk before or since. I was then shown into the kitchen
where, by an enormous fire, sat Philip Prowse. He looked up. ''I don't
like women and I don't like academics and I really haven't got anything
to say to you.''
Had I been completely sober, I should have made a fast exit, but
instead I burst out laughing. There followed one of the most interesting
expositions of a personal vision of theatrical art that I have been
privileged to hear. I am glad to say that Professor Prowse of the Slade
School of Fine Art and I have enjoyed a most amicable working
relationship ever since.
After having been a member of the Board of the Citizens' Theatre as
Glasgow University's representative for some years, I became its chair
in 1991, following the death of Bill Taylor whose unstinting commitment
and political acumen had been strong factors in its success. I learned
quickly the two golden rules: the Board may discuss artistic policy but
the final decision lies with the Artistic Director, and, the Citizens'
always balances its books, a matter of public morality as well as good
business practice. That was easy. Then they told me they were going to
convert the stall and the circle bars into two studio theatres. ''Why
two?'' I asked weakly. ''Why not two?'' was the response. And so, now we
have three auditoria.
We have had to adapt with the times, the hangover effect of the 1990
City of Culture Bonanza, the establishment of other excellent theatrical
venues in the City, the recession and, currently, the financial threats
for all the arts implicit in local government reorganisation. We have
had to adapt our policies so that the more experimental work takes place
in the studios (which also houses productions by young emerging
companies such as Wiseguise and Lookout) while the main house is
reserved for what has become known as ''Event Theatre''. But attendances
are buoyant, seat prices are still low and the books are balanced!
I have also enjoyed enormously meeting those directly involved with
mounting the plays and the dedicated staff of the administrative and
front of house teams, all of whom have gone out of their way to make ''a
woman and an academic'' feel like a member of the company. So, Mother,
40 years on, I got to play a part in the Citizens' after all.

Srinagar
KASHMIR guerrillas made a new threat today to kill two Britons and two
other western hostages unless the Indian government releases an
undisclosed number of jailed separatist militants by tomorrow evening.
''Al-Faran has issued a statement warning the government to announce
the release of the people demanded by Saturday evening,'' the militant
group said in a statement. ''Otherwise the tourists will be killed.''
The statement, delivered to local newspapers in Srinagar, said that if
the tourists were killed, the Indian government would be solely
responsible due to its ''unyielding and irresponsible'' attitude.
Al-Faran said it had no contact at present with either the government
or western diplomats from the three countries whose nationals were held
hostage.
However, the statement said: ''If the government agrees to our
demands, there can be talks over the exchange of prisoners.''
Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, American Donald Hutchings, and
German Dirk Hasert were kidnapped in southern Kashmir in early July. A
fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, was found beheaded on
August 13.
Al-Faran had previously demanded the release of 15 jailed militants,
including three Pakistanis, in exchange for the hostages.
Its latest statement did not say how many it wanted freed.
A Foreign Office spokesman in London said the report from India was
''not a new ultimatum as such''.
The understanding was that the guerrillas had set a 24-hour deadline
from September 6, which has now passed.
''Naturally, we remain concerned because there has been no contact
since Monday and we very much hope that contact with the group holding
the hostages will be renewed and we can continue to work towards their
release,'' the spokesman said.
''There have been breaks in contact in the past and we hope that
contact will be resumed as soon as possible.''
He said some discrepancies had arisen from the translation of the
guerrillas' demands which appeared in newspapers -- one an English
language publication and another a local language paper.
''It is always difficult in these circumstances to separate fact from
fiction,'' he said

IN the native language of Polynesia, Mururoa means ''place of the
great secret''.
When President Jacques Chirac told the world of his ''irrevocable
decision'' to restart atomic testing at the Pacific atoll, the secret
was out: France wants new weapons in its nuclear arsenal.
Official justification for the series of eight underground explosions
is to provide data to enable scientists to perfect computer simulation
techniques before signing up for a test ban next year.
However, the French military establishment has its own hidden agenda
to complete the development of two new missile warheads and catch up
with US and British technology. It also needs to test existing
detonators to verify their capacity to age.
Two years ago, a report from conservatives in the French National
Assembly called for another 20 tests in addition to the 41 atmospheric
and 139 underground trials which have rocked Mururoa since 1966.
One reason they gave was to prove a new warhead ''invisible to radar''
to arm its new generation of Triomphant-class nuclear submarines.
Codenamed T76, it is said to be very small with the ability to
manoeuvre in flight to defeat Star Wars-style defences.
Its development programme was frozen by President Francois
Mitterrand's decision in April 1992. The other warhead, codenamed
TN-100, is for the ASLP missile, a complicated design ranging from a few
hundred tonnes TNT equivalent to many thousands.
Defence sources say this is a sensitive subject because it suggests
France remains interested in nuclear war-combat as well as deterrence.
The atoll sinks an inch with each explosion, and experts worry one
test day Mururoa might just come apart.
What really worries the Pacific nations is the possibility of water
entering the radioactive caverns and chimneys created by the blasts
under the lagoon and contaminating the Pacific.

FRANCE yesterday expelled four Greenpeace activists who led attempts
by the group's ships to stop a nuclear test on Mururoa Atoll.
Police led the four on to commercial flights to the Netherlands,
Germany, and New Zealand, after their farewells to other members of the
environmental group in Paris.
New Zealander Stephanie Mills, who organised the Rainbow Warrior
anti-nuclear trip, flew to the Greenpeace headquarters in Amsterdam.
Derek Nicholls, skipper of the MV Greenpeace, was flying home to New
Zealand via London with Philip Pupuka of the Solomon Islands.
Swiss Peter Schwartz flew to Bremen in Germany.
A military plane had flown them to Paris from French Polynesia
yesterday.
Greenpeace lawyer Alexandre Faro said he was appealing against the
expulsion order, arguing it was an abuse of power as the activists were
taken to mainland France against their will.
Meanwhile, President Jacques Chirac has agreed to allow a European
Union mission to check on safety at France's nuclear test sites.
In a telephone conversation with Jacques Santer, president of the EU's
executive, Chirac also agreed to provide ''all necessary information''
to EU experts evaluating the tests' safety.
Preparations began immediately to allow the EU mission to leave as
soon as possible.
Under the EU's Atomic Energy Treaty, member nations must seek the
Commission's views on health and safety measures when ''particularly
dangerous experiments are to take place''.
An EU statement said information provided by France should allow the
Commission to judge whether Tuesday's underground test blast and a
series of others planned by Chirac fall under that category.
In Tahiti, peace returned to the capital Papeete as a second wave of
rioting and arson in the French colony over resumption of nuclear tests
failed to materialise.
French High Commissioner Paul Ronciere had said Papeete was in crisis
and issued a radio appeal for residents to stay out of the city after
dark.
By dusk yesterday, just over 30 hours since riots started, protesters
had abandoned their barricades around the airport, leaving behind the
charred remains of 100 cars and a blackened terminal.
In Berlin, police said 1000 young people gathered in front of the
French cultural centre while 150 schoolchildren demonstrated against the
tests outside the French consulate in Hamburg.
In Tokyo, anti-nuclear protestors staged their biggest demonstration
yet against the tests, marching to France's embassy and calling for a
boycott of French products.
* The World Court will hear arguments on Monday in New Zealand's
attempt to halt the testing, the UN court announced yesterday.
New Zealand wants its 1973 case against French atmospheric testing in
the South Pacific reopened and has asked the court to impose an
emergency testing ban while the case is considered.
The sitting ''will enable New Zealand and France to inform it (the
court) of their views,'' a World Court statement said.

Washington
SENATOR Bob Packwood gave up the chairmanship of the powerful US
Senate Finance Committee today and said his resignation would take
effect on October 1.
The resignation came in an exchange of letters with Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole. The Republican leader had suggested the timing of both
steps, and Packwood accepted it in a two-paragraph reply.
Dole initially had proposed time frames ranging from 30 to 90 days
during which he said Packwood might tie up loose ends, stay on as
nominal chairman of the tax-writing panel and ''certainly vote to
represent his state''.
The resolution this afternoon came after several impatient Democrats
threatened to force Packwood, 62, out of the Senate if he didn't leave
soon.
The Clinton administration said ''it would complicate the work of
Congress'' if the Oregon Republican remained as chairman for any length
of time.
Packwood was on the Senate floor Friday discussing welfare reform and
voting on amendments as if he hadn't decided to resign.
Senators were clearly relieved when Packwood said he would leave; the
alternative was a vote on whether to expel him for sexual and official
misconduct.
The grave charges against Packwood had festered for nearly three years
before the ethics panel's unanimous recommendation this week that he be
expelled and the senator's resignation announcement less than 24 hours
later.
As finance chairman, Packwood was to have overseen his party's drive
for fundamental changes in social and tax policy. Now that job will fall
to someone else, possibly Senator William Roth.

<HEADLINE>Count his safaris, says girl's father. Five-year-old raped after boy 'just got weird'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976470288</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A 14-YEAR-OLD boy who admitted raping a five-year-old girl was
yesterday placed on a three-year supervision order.
Judge David Clarke, QC, told Liverpool Crown Court he was making the
order on the understanding that the boy would be sent to Collingwood
House in County Durham, many miles from his home in Merseyside.
''It is not a soft option. You will be living away from home for just
as long as you would under a detention sentence, if not longer if that
is necessary in view of the experts,'' said the judge.
But the victim's father said later: ''I could have lived with him
getting five years' detention. I just hope you keep a close track of how
many safaris he goes on.''
The boy had pleaded guilty on July 5 to raping the girl at his home in
Kirkby on April 2. He sat with his head bowed alongside his father,
fighting back tears at times as the court was told of the attack.
Mr James Rae, prosecuting, said the girl lived in the same cul-de-sac
as the defendant and was a friend of his three-year-old sister.
The child was undressing to take a bath when she told her mother about
the incident.
Mr Rae said: ''Her mother acted with remarkable common sense. She
brought the matter to her husband and other adult members of the family
and then went to the defendant's house where he opened the door and
looked stunned. She did not challenge him, but made excuses and left.''
Later, after examining her daughter, she returned to the house again,
by which time the boy had admitted what had happened to his father.
''In her presence he volunteered the fact of penetration,'' Mr Rae
added. ''The defendant's parents were quite clearly horrified at what
had taken place.''
The court was told that the girl's mother intervened to protect the
boy from his own family's anger. His family had since left the area.
The children's mothers consulted their GP together and the girl was
taken to hospital. She became hysterical when examined, and for that
reason police never interviewed her about what happened.
The boy was questioned at Huyton Police Station. ''If he hadn't been
as frank as he was in the course of this interview there is every
prospect that this matter would not have come before this court,'' said
Mr Rae.
He told police: ''I just got weird and just done it. I stopped and
said, 'What am I doing? I shouldn't be doing this. It's wrong'.''
He said that the incident lasted about one minute and he had told her
not to tell anyone. Asked how he felt he replied: ''Bad. I feel
ashamed.''
Mr Brian Lewis, defending, said the boy had experienced an awakening
of sexual interest after finding pornographic material in the school
field.
''This was, in essence, a dreadfully misguided piece of immature,
adolescent, sexual experimentation. It was instantly regretted,'' he
added.
Passing sentence, the judge told the boy: ''The choice I have is
between locking you up, sentencing you to two years' detention, or
making an order unanimously recommended by the experts you have seen.''
He said he was impressed by Collingwood House, part of the Aycliffe
Young People's Centre. ''It is a long way from home. It may not be
surrounded by high prison walls but it is a place with strict rules you
will have to keep.
''You will be under close supervision and I believe it will provide
not just the help you need but that element of punishment by being away
from your home and going through a course which will involve you making
some effort yourself.''
The girl's 30-year-old father said after the hearing that he was upset
at the sentence. ''I could have lived with him getting five years'
detention, but if he's out in 12 months I just hope I don't bump into
him because I might be back here,'' he said.
''I just hope you keep a close track of how many safaris he goes on.
It has been a holiday so far -- he's been in the care of the social
workers but living with his grandparents. It's pathetic.
''Who knows if my daughter will have to see a psychiatrist in the
future. How do you know what is normal when a child stares into space
when she's never done it before, when she's gone back to her babyish
stage, and she is coming into our bedroom of a night crying?''

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S first mainland windfarm has been approved.
The project, by Trigen Ltd, in the Douglas valley, Lanarkshire, was
strongly opposed when plans were first proposed, with some locals
fearing the massive windmills would blight the scenery and create a
noise nuisance.
However, the villages of Coalburn, Douglas, and Glespin now appear
delighted: the project has created jobs, brought in cash through a
community fund, and even led to an increase in tourism.
It is now hoped to utilise them as an attraction.
Visitors have been arriving to view the spectacular site of the three
90ft high turbines on Haggshaw Hill.
Under the Trigen plan, a further 12 turbines are to be built.
Clydesdale District Councillor Danny Meikle said: ''They have proved
such an attraction we are trying to arrange for viewing platforms to be
built.''
He added that there is ''hardly any noise at all'' from the site.
''The company has agreed to pay the local community #1000 each year
for every turbine that is in use and we are now setting up a trust so
the cash can be utilized for the local communities. And we reckon a
further 20 jobs could be created during construction of the remaining
turbines.''
Mr Meikle said he was suspicious of the plans at first, but the
company answered his objections to his satisfaction.
''I have done my own survey in the three villages and there is no
doubt most people are now strongly behind the windfarm.''
The computer-controlled turbine towers are taller than electricity
pylons nearby and church steeples in either Biggar or Lanark. They can
be seen on the hilltops from the M74.
The power produced once the site is in operation fully will be enough
to produce electricity for a small town. It is sold on to power
companies.
A spokesman for Trigen Windpower Ltd said: ''If local people are happy
then we are happy. We are aware that windfarms do become tourist
attractions because we have a site in mid-Wales which gets many
visitors.''

A SHERIFF has given a young mother more time to pay more than #500 in
fines, because she has to help support the 17 brothers and sisters who
share the same house together.
Single parent Kathleen Peacock, 23, of 53 Crossmill Avenue, Barrhead,
Renfrewshire, was fined a total of #575 when she appeared for sentence
at Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday on a number of motoring offences.
But Sheriff Colin Higgins took pity on the accused and allowed her to
pay up the penalty at #8 per week after hearing how she contributed each
week to help support her extended family.
Defence agent Jonathan Manson told the court his client's family
occupied two houses which had been knocked into one to accommodate them
all.
She managed to make ends meet on income support and child benefit, but
also had to pay between #15 and #20 a week towards the weekly household
bills for the large family unit.
Peacock had earlier pleaded guilty to driving carelessly by ignoring
red traffic lights; failing to give a breath specimen to police who
stopped her in Wiltonburn Road, Glasgow, last October; driving without
insurance and without supervision, while she held only a provisional
licence.
She also admitted a separate careless driving charge of colliding with
a bus in Main Street, Barrhead, a month earlier.
Sheriff Higgins disqualified her from driving for 15 months and, after
considering how much she could afford to pay by weekly instalments, said
he would restrict the sum to #8, giving Peacock 72 weeks to pay off the
penalty.

BUS giant Stagecoach yesterday celebrated the success of its summer
drive to raise funds for the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.
Staff at the Scottish-based company raised more than #100,000 for the
charity through a series of events ranging from a ''penny a passenger''
scheme to a nationwide bucket collection.
The campaign was also boosted by the sale of 50,000 specially-designed
badges bearing the Stagecoach ''friendly bus'' symbol.
Stagecoach Group Director Mrs Ann Gloag presented a cheque for
#101,423.23 to the charity's deputy director of clinical research,
Professor Karol Sikora, at the company's annual meeting in Perth
yesterday.
Mrs Gloag said: ''This is the first time that the company has become
involved in a charity initiative of this scale.
''Together we have helped many good causes over the year but we felt
that this was an approach which had the potential to involve everyone --
our staff, our customers and our suppliers -- in a campaign which
everyone could identify with.''

COAXING child witnesses during interviews with police or social
workers -- as was found to have happened during the Orkney child abuse
investigation -- can lead to their confusing fantasy and reality,
according to the latest research.
The study by Ms Kim Roberts and Mr Mark Blades, of the University of
Sheffield, was presented to the British Psychological Society conference
at Strathclyde University yesterday .
The paper, ''Distinguishing memories of television and real life: the
effects of interacting with live and video events'', concluded that
misleading questions during interviews often confused youngsters.
Ms Roberts said debate about the influence of the media on children
had been stimulated during the Jamie Bulger trial. The trial judge said
his killers may have been influenced by a horror video they had recently
watched.
Ms Roberts said there had been little research into the subject.
She also said children in the Orkney case were said to have been
coaxed during interviews with social workers.
Ms Roberts said children were increasingly being called to act as
witnesses in court. Her findings showed that interviews should be
carried out very carefully, without prompting from adults.
For their research, children aged four, six, and nine helped an adult
to make a puppet. Half went on to take part in a film with the same
adult making a puppet, while the rest simply watched the film
afterwards.
A week later, all the children recalled the events remarkably
accurately. However, most of the children confused some of the real
events with those on the video.
She added: ''When we allowed children to say in their own words what
happened they were very accurate. However, when we started questioning
closely, inaccuracies did show up, especially when we asked misleading
questions. The best way to interview children is just to ask them to say
in their own words what happened.
''Children don't report as much information unless they are asked
specific questions. But when they are asked specific questions they do
appear confused and seem to confuse events. This has important
consequences for professionals who interview children.''
She said there was little difference between what children remembered
of the ''live'' event and a video of a very similar event.

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson said yesterday that
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth must hand back water to local
authorities if he wished to be taken seriously.
Addressing the Scottish conference of the Institute of Revenues,
Rating and Valuation -- at which Mr Forsyth spoke 24 hours earlier -- Mr
Robertson said there would be no proper water supply for the country had
it not been for the past efforts of local authorities.
Mr Forsyth had said in his address that he wanted a new deal for local
government in Scotland, with proper devolution of power.
Opening his address at Peebles, Mr Robertson commented: ''The words
'Greeks' and 'gifts' come to mind.
''If he wants to be taken seriously, let him give water back to the
local authorities. This is perhaps the most potent political issue in
Scotland at the moment.''
Stating that quangos were not the answer, Mr Robertson said that if
the Scottish Secretary wished to be on the side of local government,
reinforcing local democracy, the cry should be ''Hallelujah''.
Then he warned: ''The drive to centralise is a philosophy which has
corroded an interest in the democratic process, and affected
efficiency.''
He said that a devolved Scottish parliament under a Labour government
would reinforce local government throughout the country.

RIGHT-WING former Minister John Redwood embarrassed the Government
yesterday by joining Labour and the Liberal Democrats in criticising
North West Water's #1600m hostile bid for the electricity company
Norweb.
He called for the proposed merger to be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, and warned of the danger of ''two very powerful
monopolies'' ganging up on their customers.
This unexpected criticism from one of the Tory party's most
enthusiastic proponents of privatisation and the free market will help
to undermine the Government's policy of non-interference in the
free-for-all that has gripped the privatised utilities.
The bid, which would create Britain's first mixed utility company, was
rejected yesterday by Norweb for being too low. Norweb suggested other
bids were expected.
Labour consumer affairs spokesman Nigel Griffiths warned that the
merger would leave seven million customers with no choice and no
consumer protection. ''We aren't dealing with two world-class companies.
We are dealing with two companies whose individual results and
performance is at best average,'' he told BBC Radio.
Mr Redwood echoed Labour's theme of a threat to the consumer. He said
there were ''obvious dangers if two very powerful monopolies with strong
positions in the lives of their customers ganged up together against the
customer''.
He called on the Government to introduce proper competition in the
water and electricity markets. Until then, he said, the North
West/Norweb merger would not be safe.
Tory MP Dr Keith Hampson, a member of the Commons Select Committee on
Trade and Industry, also called for the bid to be referred to the MMC.
''There could be considerable benefits for the customers. There would be
potentially more scope for investment in the water industry,'' he said.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's industry spokesman, said the struggle for
the ownership of vital utilities was descending into a farce. ''The key
principle which the Tories have refused to grasp is that each and every
one of these bids must be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.''
The huge profits of Britain's privatised water companies have been
boostedby more than #31m in EU grants distributed by the Government, it
was disclosed yesterday.
The cash, from Europe's regional development fund, is on top of #164m
they received before privatisation -- payments which triggered a
Brussels inquiry into allegations that money was misused to fatten up
state-owned utilities before sell off.
Figures in a leaked Department of Trade and Industry document show
that nine water companies received a total of #163,960,000 before
privatisation, and seven have since received #31,700,000.
Yorkshire Water has been the biggest beneficiary since the sell-off,
receiving more than #11m. Severn Trent has had #5m, Anglian Water #4m,
Welsh Water #3.8m, South West Water and North West Water #3.2m each, and
Northumbrian Water, #1.5m.
Ms Arlene McCarthy, Labour's Euro spokeswoman on regional policy and
MEP for the Peak District, said: ''Taxpayers' money intended to bring
jobs and investment to areas of high unemployment has gone to utility
companies which are already making vast profits out of the ordinary
taxpayer.
''The Government is clearly favouring privatised utilities over other
companies which find it impossible to get direct European grant aid.''
A Government spokesman said: ''We are confident that we account
properly for everything we have spent, according to the rules.''
* Crisis-hit Yorkshire Water has been accused of holding back millions
of pounds which could be used to plug leaks in its drought-stricken
region.
The Yorkshire consumer group, Water Watch, claims #59m from the
company's profits last year are unaccounted for and says it believes the
money may be used to protect shareholders' dividends if profits fall in
the future.
The company strongly denies the accusations, saying the money is a
float which is constantly drawn upon.

THE Prime Minister yesterday scorned proposals for the Scottish
Parliament, proclaiming them ''loopy'' and fit only for the rubbish bin.
Mr John Major was speaking in St Andrews during the Scottish leg of
his grand tour of Britain to win back disaffected Tory voters. He
repeated the message to the party faithful later in Perth, and at a
fund-raising dinner last night in Stirling.
Referring to plans for a 129-member Parliament elected by proportional
representation, a system he described as ''alien'' to the British way,
he said: ''I think these proposals are loopy. The only thing you can do
is pick them up, tear them up, and drop them in the bin.''
However, Labour and the Liberal Democrats claimed Mr Major made a
series of blunders in the course of his onslaught.
He repeatedly criticised the ''document'' containing the details, when
this is not due out until next month. He continued to say the tartan tax
would cost each family #6 per week when the Parliament may not choose to
use its tax-varying powers. And he expressed amazement at the proposed
system of proportional representation, when this had been agreed almost
a year ago.
But Mr Major has clearly decided to keep up his onslaught on Home
Rule, insisting that although he understood the aspirations behind the
plans, they must be resisted because they would wreck the Union.
''Yesterday we saw the proposals from Labour and the Liberal Democrats
concerning the possibility of a Scottish Parliament, were one to be
introduced, and some of the arrangements they have made for it. I must
say it seems to be an extraordinary, shambolic document to have been
issued after six years of discussion.''
He said he would not reiterate his own well-known opposition to a
Scottish Parliament but added: ''It seems to me to be quite
extraordinary that they are planning to increase the number of members,
to ensure that half of those members had no direct constituency
relationship, and ensure that there would be no by-elections were they
to disappear so people can cast their own votes against the way they
have been behaving.
''I think it is an alien option to turn a Parliament into a
superannuated quango which is what seems to be the outcome of their
dicussions.
''It must be a tremendous let-down to the people of Scotland who have
looked to Labour and the Liberal Democrats to produce something
worthwhile to find that they have produced something that is, frankly, a
remarkably inadequate document after so much work and after so many
disagreements between them.''
Asked how the Tories could suggest improvements to the plan, he said:
''I don't think you could turn this into an adequate document. The best
thing you could do with that document is to tear it up. It is of no
conceivable use.
''They have had six years to debate this in the Labour Party and what
I find frankly quite extraordinary is that any party that claims it is
ready for government, after six years of debate on an issue that has
been the central part of political debate in Scotland in the whole of
that period, still doesn't have any credible answers to a large number
of the most obvious questions.
''When Tony Blair was here earlier this week he described the most
fundamental issue of all, the way in which to finance the Parliament, as
an 'accountancy detail' -- an accountancy detail!
''Well I certainly don't regard the way the business of government is
funded across the United Kingdom as an accountancy detail, and someone
could only have said that if they were trying to cover up the fact that
they have no credible policy to offer.''
Mr Major added: ''Neither do I think it would be regarded as an
accountancy detail when people pay what we have rightly termed a tartan
tax. An extra #6 per week for a Scottish family is not an accountancy
detail.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson pointed out that Mr Major
already presided over an ''alien'' system of proportional representation
in Northern Ireland and said he appeared clueless and badly briefed.
''This is just the same stale old mixture of fear, fiction, and
arrogance which has brought the Scottish Conservative Party to its
knees. If the Prime Minister keeps on dismissing the ambitions of the
Scottish people, then they will dismiss him and his party completely,''
he said.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said: ''This makes you
wonder where on earth John Major has been for the last year and who is
briefing him. He ought to realise that it is his arrogant refusal to
accept the wish of the majority of Scots for self-government which poses
the biggest threat to the future of the Union.
''Rather than descending into bland sloganising, he ought to recognise
that his taking stock exercise has failed to meet the aspirations of
most Scots, and he should now engage is serious political debate about
Scotland's future in the Union.''
Earlier, in St Andrews the Prime Minister announced additional funding
for organisations which help recruit people for voluntary work, with the
emphasis on giving young people and the elderly a chance to make a
contribution. More than #500,000 is to be given to the volunteer
movement in Scotland, including grants to Age Concern and the Scottish
Community Education Council.

POLICE want to speak to a charity manager who disappeared after a
deficit of #10,000 was found in the charity's funds.
Harry Wright, 45, transport manager of Dial-A-Journey, which runs a
fleet of 10 minibuses chauffeuring disabled people about Central region,
vanished last month.
Police were drafted in when Dial-A-Journey management discovered the
cash missing from its accounts.
In his absence Mr Wright has been dismissed from his #19,000 a year
post at the charity's offices in Stirling and the job is being
readvertised.
Now Interpol have been called in after sightings of Mr Wright were
reported in Oregon, in the United States.
Yesterday Central Scotland Police confirmed they were following up
''alleged financial irregularities'' at the charity.
Charity director and local councillor Tom Sinclair said everyone at
the charity was shocked. He said Mr Wright had worked hard for the
charity and had helped it become well established.
He added: ''When Mr Wright disappeared we started to become suspicious
that all was not as it should be.
''We did an investigation on our own with the bank and various other
places and realised something was wrong and asked the police to
investigate.''
Yesterday, Mr Sinclair assured disabled people in Central region who
rely on the service that it would continue as normal.
He said: ''I'd like to reassure local people that this valuable
service will be unaffected by this matter.
''We have just signed a funding agreement which guarantees the
Dial-A-Journey service for the next three years''.
Divorcee Mr Wright had worked for the charity since 1988. It is
believed he had recently been suffering from depression.
The charity -- which employs 13 full-time and seven part-time
employees -- is partly funded by Central Regional Council. Set up in
1987, last year it was awarded a grant of #220,000 by the council.
However, like most charities, Dial-A-Journey also draws on public
donations.

ONE of Britain's biggest sweet makers is risking the wrath of millions
of chocolate lovers . . . by changing the recipe of the Mars bar.
Confectionery giant Mars has also dropped the slogan ''A Mars a day
helps you work, rest and play'' from wrappers, and replaced it with
''Now . . . There is Only One Mars''.
A Mars spokesman said last night that the secret recipe had been
modified to make it ''even smoother'', but he could give no details. The
new bars have just started to appear in the shops.
''We have modified the recipe,'' he said, ''and some of the new bars
have starting arriving in shops before we could make the official
announcement.''
New bars list ingredients in a different way, although the basic mix
of milk chocolate, glucose syrup and sugar remains.
New wrappers carry the same Mars slogan, but are now highlighted with
yellow.

ANXIOUS health chiefs were yesterday planning a blitz to trace anyone
who has come into contact with patients at a Paisley hospital hit by an
outbreak of scabies.
Mr Mike Dingwall, medical director of Renfrewshire Healthcare NHS
Trust, said that there was no need for the public to be alarmed.
But he urged people not to ignore the symptoms of itchiness and red
rash caused by a mite burrowing into the skin, and to seek medical
attention.
Mr Dingwall said the scabies scare -- confirmed by a skin specialist
-- had been confined to three patients in ward 16 of 400-bed Dykebar
Hospital for psychiatric and geriatric patients.
''What we are now doing is trying to identify relatives, other
visitors, and staff who have been in contact with the affected patients
and have them treated,'' he added.

THE Prime Minister yesterday denied the Ulster peace process was in
crisis while maintaining his insistence that all-party talks on the
future of the province could not go ahead until the IRA agrees to
surrender its weapons.
He admitted that the postponement of the UK-Irish summit this week
following a disagreement with the Irish Government over the
decommissioning of paramilitary weapons was a setback and a
disappointment.
But he pledged Britain would continue to work with the Irish
Government and ''sensible'' democratic parties in Northern Ireland to
make sure violence ''comes out of Northern Ireland politics for good''.
His optimism was reinforced by the Taoiseach, Mr John Bruton, who
sought to mend the damage caused by the cancellation of the summit by
warning Sinn Fein he was prepared to reach agreement with Britain on
decommissioning without consulting Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams or
the IRA.
London has sought to put the blame for the collapse of the summit had
been pinned on Mr Bruton, who was accused of caving in to Sinn Fein's
refusal to agree to a surrender of IRA weapons as a prerequisite for
joining all-party talks.
The two governments had agreed the wording for a proposal to create an
international commission to oversee the decommissioning of weapons. But
Sinn Fein refused to support it if it was based on Britain's
weapons-before-talks scenario.
Mr Major said yesterday: ''We will continue to work with the
government in Ireland and continue to look at what options we can
produce to ensure that we can bring that peace permanently to Northern
Ireland. It was a setback last week but it was not a crisis.''
He added: ''I very much hope that peace will stick. I think if anyone
is contemplating bringing the gun back into Northern Ireland politics, I
do not know how they could properly defend that to any audience anywhere
in the world. There is no justification for it.
''What we are asking of Sinn Fein, and indeed of the loyalist
paramilitaries as well, is that they agree a method of taking the gun
out of politics. That they agree the removal of weapons from Northern
Ireland politics and then they begin to move down the decommissioning
path because no other political parties will sit at the round table
talks with them until that happens.
''There is a very simple point that underlines it. If Sinn Fein are
genuine and want a peaceful democratic future in Northern Ireland, then
they do not need an army at their back and they do not need weapons.
That is well understood by everyone and we will need to have progress on
that.''
Earlier, in a speech in Dublin, Mr Bruton said he was prepared to do
''all that is reasonable'' to create the conditions for success in the
search for peace.
He said it was up to the two governments to make progress and bring
other parties with them. ''Any move by the governments must be one that
is well prepared, and we must have a very firm understanding that it
will work.''
But, in a clear warning to Sinn Fein, he added: ''That does not mean
that we can necessarily obtain commitments in advance. In some cases,
parties might be unwilling, on principle, to give a commitment to any
proposal until the proposal had been published and debated.
''This means that the two governments can, and indeed must, act
together as governments when the time is right. That is something I am
determined to do.''
He called on Sinn Fein and the Unionist parties to accept that they
also needed to make a move for peace to succeed. ''If this phase of the
peace process is to be successfully traversed, a move is required not
only from the two governments, but also from both Sinn Fein and the
mainstream Unionists at more or less the same time,'' he said.
However, Mr Bruton also cautioned Britain over its refusal to show
long-term trust in Sinn Fein and the IRA. ''The people of this state
have placed their trust in Sinn Fein that the IRA will never again use
or threaten to use arms to achieve a political objective''.
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring last night spoke of his ''worry
that the quality of hope has begun to falter'' in the peace process.
He told the British-Irish Association conference in Cambridge that the
gift of hope must now come from political leaders on all sides.
Mr Spring said even if it was unrealistic to set decommissioning of
IRA weapons as a precondition for beginning talks, it was entirely
reasonable to set total disarmament as a priority and an essential goal
to be achieved through the negotiating process.
* A man injured in a punishment beating four months ago is seeking
sanctuary in a Roman Catholic cathedral claiming that the IRA has warned
him to leave Londonderry by tomorrow.
Mr Ciaran Collins, his brother Martin, and a nephew were beaten up by
armed and masked men in their home May. He said a gang had attempted to
break in again yesterday, and ordered him out of the country within 48
hours. Church authorities have declined to comment.

boycott the talks, Patrick Brogan writes from Washington.
Gerry Adams is also here, as was Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin
McGuinness earlier this week. All are trying to swing the Americans over

question because he needs every political success he can manage: the
next presidential election is barely a year away. Bringing peace to
Ireland would be a great feather in his cap. It would look more than a

issue when he reaches Ireland in November.

AN MP is to continue his campaign against low flying in the South-west
of Scotland, despite assurances that the sorties are being monitored
rigorously.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, was
speaking after viewing a demonstration of the Royal Air Force's
sophisticated Skyguard tracking system.
The system, used by the Argentinian forces to track and fire on
British warplanes during the Falklands conflict, is now used to monitor
low-flying aircraft around Britain to ensure that they are obeying
strict rules.
This week, the Skyguard team of RAF police officers and a radar
operator has been operating at undisclosed locations throughout south
Ayrshire. Yesterday, however, it went public and welcomed visitors to a
demonstration in Maybole.
Local people voiced their concerns to the team and to local community
relations officer Richard Cliff over the safety of low flying.
He said: ''I can understand the concerns of people but I have tried to
assure them that the sorties are operated under strict safety rules and
are kept to a minimum.
''The fact remains, though, that to have fully trained pilots ready at
a moment's notice to take part in conflicts such as the Gulf or
Falklands there must be training flights at low level like this.''
The Skyguard system searches for low-flying aircraft, locks on to
them, and tracks them to monitor their height, speed, and route.
Sergeant Paul Baker, of the RAF Police, said: ''We are a bit like the
police who are operating a radar check on cars but we have to react a
little bit quicker as a Tornado covers a mile in around seven seconds
and we have to lock on to him in order to do the tracking.
''The pilots know we are operating but don't know where or when but by
and large they stick to their flight rules. If they do not we can carry
out an investigation and compile a report and there may be disciplinary
action taken.''
Mr Foulkes said: ''I have been very impressed by this piece of
equipment and by the honesty and integrity of the crew operating it.
''The fact, remains, though, that the people of this area seem to be
getting more than their fair share of low flying and there is real
concern about the safety aspects and the inconvenience this causes.
''The number of complaints of noise and of animals being distressed
has rocketed in recent months and I am particularly uncomfortable about
the dropping of the 10-mile exclusion zone around Prestwick airport
which was based on low traffic figures at the airport.
''That is no longer the case and I will be meeting the relevant
Minister when Parliament resumes to urge him to reinstate the exclusion
zone and to look again at the whole question of low flying.''

MEMBERS of the Western Meeting Club, the body which owns and operates
Ayr Racecourse, voted last night for an independent investigation into
the club's financial affairs.
Voting at an extraordinary general meeting -- where they were told
that #100,000 of club funds had disappeared -- was 177 to 159 in favour
of the investigation. It has already been announced that a senior
employee has left the company.
Afterwards, acting chairman Mr Jake Stewart said he was disappointed
at the outcome of the vote. He said he would be considering whether the
position of the committee is tenable.
Mr Tony Collins, who proposed the motion, said: ''At the end of the
day #100,000 seems to have gone missing. The only comment I would like
to make is that this is a sad day for the club. There are no winners.''
Earlier. Strathclyde Police had confirmed that they are investigating
alleged financial irregularities at the club.

<HEADLINE>A chance for peace as Bosnia carved up. Deal rests on guns falling silent.</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
THE WARRING parties in Bosnia last night agreed to a peace deal, with
the country being carved up between them. The next step is for the guns
to be silenced.
Britain hailed the breakthrough agreement as a milestone on the road
to peace.
President Bill Clinton was more cautious, describing it as ''a good
first step''. It was his assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke
who was instrumental in bringing about the deal in Geneva.
The Bosnian Serbs accepted for the first time the terms of the
five-nation Contact Group plan, which gives them 49% of territory and
the Muslim/Croat federation 51%.
There was no mention, however, of a ceasefire in the war, and Nato
warned that the agreement would not mean an end to its nine-day-old
bombing campaign.
The agreement on the basic principles for peace negotiations
guaranteed the existence of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a single sovereign
state, but made up of two distinct entities.
Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey said the accord outlining
Bosnia's future constitution ruled out the possibility of Bosnian Serbs
joining a Greater Serbia.
The agreement specifically allows the Bosnian Serbs and Croats to have
political links with their ethnic partners elsewhere in the former
Yugoslavia, but political confederation with either side is strictly
forbidden.
The landmark accord contains a key clause establishing a human rights
commission that would have power over both republics. Mr Sacirbey said:
''We support this because the question is what kind of people will lead
the Serb entity. Will it be people like (Radovan) Karadzic and (Ratko)
Mladic, who are guilty of war crimes, or will it cleanse itself?''
There was a welcome for the deal in Belgrade, where the Government
applauded President Slobodan Milosevic for the breakthrough. It said in
a statement the adoption of basic principles of the peace plan meant
''the big powers have legalised the Republika Srpska,'' as the Serb
entity in Bosnia is known. Mr Milosevic has been granted a key role, and
casting vote, in negotiations by the Bosnian Serbs.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said the deal ''opened a door to
peace'' but stressed it was only verbal and more work was needed to
consolidate his new Serb republic. ''It is not at all easy to win a
state for oneself. In three and a half years we have achieved the first
step, the door is now open to peace.''
He clearly relished the acknowledgement of his self-declared republic.
''We are no longer the Bosnian Serbs,'' he said. ''Many commentators
were forced to utter the words Republika Srpska today.''
Despite the deal, the American directing Nato's blitz of the Bosnian
Serbs, Admiral Leighton Smith, warned he could get even tougher if they
refuse to pull out from around Sarajevo.
A Nato official echoed this, saying conditions for ending the bombing
are no more Bosnian Serb attacks in UN ''safe areas'', removal of all
Bosnian Serb heavy weapons from around Sarajevo, and the opening of
Sarajevo airport.
Last night the Bosnian leaders were also adopting a tough line, trying
to ensure they would gain the most from the deal. ''No territorial
exchanges will be considered, only Bosnian Serb withdrawals from the
territories that are designated as belonging to the (Muslim-Croat)
federation,'' President Alija Izetbegovic said.
''Our army will not withdraw from any positions that they are
currently holding anywhere. Not a single foot,'' he said. His Prime
Minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, added: ''We are not even considering
trading Tuzla and Gorazde . . . or any other area in Bosnia''.
Despite these pitfalls ahead, the agreement was a considerable coup
for the American peace initiative spearheaded by Mr Holbrooke.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind welcomed the outcome of the meeting.
''The principles agreed at this meeting represent an important step
forward in the search for a political settlement. In particular, it
means in effect that the Bosnian Serb leadership have agreed to
negotiate on the basis of the Contact Group plan,'' he said.
''This is only a step on the path to peace. Difficult negotiations lie
ahead.''
Mr Holbrooke underlined the agreement to form ''two democratic
entities''.
''Each will be self-governing with its own constitution,'' he said,
stressing the agreement was only the basis for difficult negotiations to
come.
The agreement also called for ''complete elections under international
auspices to adopt and adhere to normal international and human-rights
standards and obligations, including the obligation to allow freedom of
movement and enable displaced persons to repossess their homes or to
receive just compensation''.
Mr Holbrooke said the future status of ''Sarajevo is certainly the
most crucial territorial issue''. He said the US supports a unified
capital, and likened its status and emotional significance to a
combination of Berlin to Germany and Jerusalem to the Middle East.
He added: ''We're all aware of the fact that there's a difference
between a paper peace and an implemented peace.''
There were also warning words from Liberal Democrat leader Paddy
Ashdown. ''It is good news but it is only a first step. The key thing is
whether the guns stop firing.''
The words of caution rest on the problems which lie ahead. The crucial
issue of Eastern Slavonia, for instance, remained unresolved. The Serbs,
anxious not to lose the territory gained in 1991, blocked a declaration
calling for a peaceful resolution to the problem as they feared it would
herald reintegration with Croatia.
The next step in the process is an intensive new programme of shuttle
diplomacy by US and EU peace negotiators.
Russia will carry out parallel negotiations.
0 The decision appeared to be a concerted effort by the other members
of the Contact Group -- Britain, the US, France and Germany -- to
maintain some form of international consensus after stinging criticism
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

ONE rail passenger died last night and seven were injured as dozens of
panic-stricken people fled from a train that had turned into a blazing
fireball.
The evacuation turned to horror as some passengers, seized by what one
called ''sheer bloody panic'' and desperate to escape smoke-filled
carriages, spilled out on the main line in the path of an oncoming
high-speed 125 train.
As confusion grew, there were early reports that two people had been
killed but British Transport Police confirmed later that there was only
one fatality.
Superintendent Peter Edwards told reporters at the station in
Maidenhead, Berkshire, close to the scene, the dead man was in his 30s
and from the Swindon area.
A further seven people were injured, from smoke inhalation and minor
burns, said Mr Edwards.
He added: ''The cause of the fire appears to have been that the fuel
tank on the engine has come loose, dropped on to the track, bounced
along the sleeper and fractured and fuel has been released, causing a
fire to the three carriages behind.
''How it was caused at the moment we do not know.
''One possibility is that something was left on the track but there is
no evidence to suggest that this was the cause at the moment.
''It is something we will look very closely at.''
The casualties were all thought to be first-class passengers in the
front portion of a London-Swansea Intercity.
British Transport Police said an inquiry would be launched into how
passengers were able to pour off the train on to a busy main line.
Inspector Andy Ball, of BTP, said there would be ''an investigation
into the evacuation procedure''.
Railtrack press officer Sandra Jones was travelling on the Paddington
to Twyford train, which ran parallel, out of London, with the train that
caught fire.
She said: ''As we were coming along the tracks we were aware that
smoke was coming off the adjacent line. We pulled up parallel to the
train.
''The driver announced that the train next to us was having a problem
and asked the rail staff to go to the front of the train which I did.
''When I got there I saw that the other train was blackened by smoke.
People were getting off on the embankment side.
''However, there was one door open on the track side near the front of
the train but I didn't see anybody come out of it.
''One of the things we have to look at for the cause of this accident
has to be vandalism. Something must have caused the fuel tank to
rupture.''
Mr Edwards said the driver of the train would be interviewed by BTP
officers.
''It appears that the driver realised there was a fire on the train,
the fuel tank was causing a hell of a row, and as he looked back he saw
flames running down the side of the three carriages behind his engine.
He stopped immediately,'' he said.
Mr Edwards said passengers on the train would be interviewed about the
incident and the evacuation.
''As far as I understand at the moment, and still subject to
investigation, there was very little time for anybody to be told what to
do. People started to get out because they saw the flames.
''It all happened so quickly as I understand it that people left the
train. There was no organised evacuation,'' he added.
The flames on the train were not believed to have gone inside the
carriages, he added.

<HEADLINE>Trimble is new Ulster leader. Victory for the right.</HEADLINE>

THERE was a surprise choice for the new leader of the Ulster Unionist
Party last night, when Mr David Trimble, MP for Upper Bann, was elected
to succeed Mr James Molyneaux.
At the Ulster Hall in Belfast, Mr Trimble scored a decisive victory,
gaining 466 votes against Strangford MP John Taylor's 333 in the third
and final count.
Mr William Ross and the Rev Martin Smyth had earlier been eliminated
and Mr Ken Maginnis withdrew.
At 50, Mr Trimble was the youngest of the candidates and a surprise
victor, with Mr Taylor a strong favourite with the bookmakers.
When the result was announced there was loud cheering and applause and
a standing ovation from members of the ruling Ulster Unionist Council
who had spent just over three hours deciding on the new leader.
The result will be closely studied in London and Dubln for its
implication on the preace process. Mr Trimble was considered to be the
most right-wing of the candidates and there is certain to be a change of
direction for the party following 16 years being led by Mr Molyneaux. He
resigned last week.
After his win, he confirmed he would speak to Dublin Ministers to make
sure they understood his position and that he understood theirs, but he
ruled out any meeting with Sinn Fein even if there was a gesture of the
IRA starting to disarm.
He said: ''It is not just a matter of gestures but meeting the
requirements of the Downing Street Declaration -- of establishing a
commitment to exclusively peaceful methods -- that was the criteria set
down by the British and Irish governments 18 months ago and it still has
to be met.''
Mr Trimble dismissed suggestions that he was a hardliner: ''I like to
think of myself as a moderniser.''
He insisted he was not prepared to take any risks with the peace
process. ''Peace is not something to gamble with.''
Mr Trimble was given a standing ovation after his election.
He said: ''I am sure this party will unite and meet the challenges
that lie before us. That challenge is to ensure that our democratic
birthright as British citizens within the UK is recovered and preserved
for ourselves and for the future.''
He said he would see Irish Ministers for discussions ''because there
are things we want to see them do''.
For the former senior Queen's University law lecturer it has been a
swift rise to the political pinnacle: he became an MP only five years
ago.
The father of four had initially declared he would not be a runner
when Mr Molyneaux resigned but changed his mind four days later after,
he said, receiving support from many sections of the party.
Mr Trimble said they had challenges to meet and overcome.
And he added: ''I am confident in our Unionism, the rights of our
cause and the ability to argue it wherever that may be.
''We must not be defensive of the virtues of the union. We must
promote those virtues vigorously in Ulster, throughout the United
Kingdom and elsewhere. I am confident we will meet those challenges and
succeed.''
