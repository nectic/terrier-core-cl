MADRID: Blind lottery ticket seller Ricardo Cortes, 33, was yesterday
preparing to take one of his four sons to America for life-saving heart
surgery after bad luck turned into a fortune. A week ago a drug addict
stole #1000 worth of tickets from Cortes in Madrid. He was forced to
raise a loan to pay the lottery organisation for the missing tickets.
Later, however, police caught the thief and recovered the tickets which
included winning numbers worth a total of #250,000. The windfall means
that Cortes can now take his six-year-old son Luis to hospital in
Houston, Texas, for the operation.

SANMEX, the Rutherglen-based toiletries and household cleaners company
expects to clinch a multi-thousand pound order from China thanks to
Herald reader Ray Cheung who owns the Purple Palace Restaurant in Main
Street Uddingston.
It appears that Mr Cheung spotted an article in the Herald Business
section about a #300,000 fly killer order Sanmex won last year for the
Chinese market.
The restaurateur contacted his brother in Hong Kong who flew over to
Scotland to meet Norman Ferguson, sales and marketing director of
Sanmex.
Mr Ferguson told Business Diary: ''I am very confident that we will
get an order as a result of our meeting. The first order will be for fly
killer followed by air freshener.''
Sanmex already produces the fly killer with Chinese labels, and if the
first order for air freshener is successful then Chinese labels will be
prepared for further contracts.
Could it be that once the order is finally clinched Sanmex will have a
celebration dinner in a certain Chinese restaurant?
Words of wisdom
from Weisfeld
LOCAL girl made good Vera Weisfeld, of What Every Woman Wants fame, is
addressing the Hamilton District Business Forum on Tuesday evening at
5.30pm in the Barncluith Business Centre in Hamilton.
Surprise, surprise, Mrs Weisfeld, who lives in nearby Bothwell, will
be speaking on the subject of business success.
Marion Currie, the Business Forum's co-ordinator, says anyone who
would like to go along to hear her speak would be most welcome. A light
buffet will be served.
Could be worth dropping in to pick up a few tips -- she and her
husband Gerald are reputed to have sold their chain of shops for #30m.
Flight dogged
with problems
BERNARD Cooke, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland's
director of business courses, is off to Siberia later this month to
oversee a five-week course in Novosibirk, the Siberian capital.
This is the first time the ICAS has organised a course in Siberia, but
Mr Cooke is no stranger to Eastern Europe, and is well aware of the
vagaries of internal flights in that part of the world.
He recalls one particular journey when puppies were being sold to
passengers as they waited to board the plane. During the flight the pups
were allowed to roam freely, scampering up and down the aisle, which
must have made the in-flight service problematic.
The ICAS established a Russian connection three years ago when it
first held courses in St Petersburg aimed at helping Russians train
their own accountants.
The Siberian course, which starts on January 23, will be on
western-style accounting and auditing, and Bernard Cooke will be
assisted by Russian teachers who were on the St Petersburg course three
years ago.
Farming enters
the space age
STAND by for take off. The British National Space Centre is holding a
press conference in London next week to increase awareness of the
British space programme.
But recipients of invitations could be forgiven if they thought at
first that the wrong Ministry had sent them out.
Joint host of the meeting will be Earl Howe, Minister for Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, which sounds rather down to earth for something
which is supposed to be about outer space.
The agenda for the meeting includes sugar-beet crop monitoring and the
Starfish Fisheries Information Service.
Mike Blackwell, head of information at the BNSC, however, explained
eveything: ''What we are trying to do is show what we can do with the
information which is sent down. Satellite information can tell you if
your crops are healthy and when to harvest them.''
The harvest information means, of course, that not only do farmers no
longer need to peer over hedges to see how their neighbour's crops are
getting on, countries can also use it to their commercial advantage if
they know when another country's wheat harvest is due to come on the
market and also what kind of harvest it is likely to be.
Closer to home, there is a project in Elgin which is monitoring
activity in our forests.
Landscapes are changing all the time because of tree felling or
planting, but the Ordnance Survey people do not necessarily know. Using
satellites, an up-to-date picture can be produced of our changing
landscape.
All of which gives a new meaning to the expression ''spy in the sky''.
I wonder if the satellite ducks every time it hears the cry Timber!
Burns goes
international
RABBIE Burns was an internationalist, which is in keeping with the
International Burns Supper which the Edinburgh and Lothian Export Club
is organising in the capital's Scandic Crown Hotel to celebrate its
first anniversary.
The supper began as a Euro Burns night but was quickly changed to a
truly International Burns Supper as the range of nationalities attending
widened.
Consul generals from Russia and Japan will be there as well as those
from Spain, Italy and Belgium.
Other guests will include Babette Orr, the American consul general,
Bob Forsyth of United Distillers and Douglas Hamill of Halls of
Broxburn.
Des Bonnar will be chairman for the evening and guest speakers will
include Charles Winter, who is a former president of the Edinburgh
Chamber of Commerce, and Ian Brown, its current chief executive.
Welcome to the
last resort
WHO could ever describe Glasgow as ''The Last Resort''? No, not
Edinburgh, but the city's very own chamber of commerce.
The Glasgow chamber is moving into the breakfast meeting business next
month, and the first topic it has chosen for discussion is ''Glasgow and
Tourism, The Last Resort?''
Sybil Gilmore, the chamber's marketing manager, told Business Diary:
''The title is a play on words which we thought might make people think.
We will have senior people from the tourist industry taking part, and we
hope to have 100 at our first breakfast.''
The venue for the breakfast meeting is the Hilton Hotel and tickets
are priced at #15.
The date is February 14, and with the event starting at 7am you will
just have to leave your loved one's Valentine card on the pillow.
On the trail of
Tontine Houses
THE Planning Exchange, one of the UK's leading information research
centres on urban and rural development, recently moved from the premises
it had occupied in Glasgow's Bath Street for 21 years to plush new ones
in Gordon Street.
The building it is now in is called Tontine House. For the
uninitiated, a tontine was an investment device invented by an Italian
in the 17th century. It is an annuity shared by subscribers to a loan,
the shares increasing as subscribers die until the last survivor gets
all.
Tony Burton, a director of The Planning Exchange, now wants to find
out how many Tontine Houses there are in the UK.
He explained to Business Diary: ''I think it would be an interesting
exercise as I would like to find out what sort of company we are in.''
Sounds like a good Agatha Christie murder plot to me.
If you have any details of existing Tontine Houses, or are a
subscriber to such an annuity get in touch with Business Diary. We
promise not to let any of your fellow subscribers know your whereabouts.
Women tackle
problem of stress
FEELING stressed out? Why not go along to the Fife Chamber of Commerce
Women in Business meeting in the Balbirnie House Hotel, Markinch, at
7.30pm on Monday evening when the subject under discussion is stress?
The speakers are Jo Cummings of the Keil Centre in Edinburgh and Dr
Ian Tierney who specialises in stress management also at the Keil
Centre.
The Fife Women in Business group was the first body to be set up in
the county to help women when it was formed three years ago.
Yetis join the
fire service
YETIS sound like creatures that should be building snowmen rather than
fire engines, but three YETIs are helping to do just that at Emergency
One in Cumnock.
A YETI, for those who don't know, is someone taking part in the Youth
Employment Training Initiative which gives young people aged 18 to 24 a
job after a two-year training period.
The original Yeti is the native Tibetan name for the abominable
snowman.
The Cumnock company builds around 50 fire engines every year for local
authorities in Scotland, Northern England and Ireland, and has already
found several jobs for youths on this particular training scheme.
A great idea but some titles just don't suit acronyms.
Putting housing
on the agenda
HOUSING is on the agenda next week when the Council of Mortgage
Lenders holds a one-day conference in the Hilton Hotel in Glasgow.
The CML has put together a powerful list of speakers on the subject
including Sir James Mellon, chairman of Scottish Homes, and David
Comely, Glasgow's Director of Housing.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of Housing at the Scottish
Office, will give the keynote speech to the seminar which will be
chaired by David Smith, chief executive of Dunfermline Building Society.
With the title ''Improving Provision in the Years to Come'', the
seminar sounds as if it could be fertile circulation ground for a Big
Issue vendor.

Harsh realities, such as making decisions about how to while away the
hours, recede with the distant shores on board a luxury cruise. John
Linklater enjoys the full-star treatment and also finds himself
impressed by the tantalising glimpses offered on various ports of call.
AT THE craps table a stocky Canadian called Sam is winning with a
system. He lays up his bets on the six, eight, and bar, treating it like
a Monopoly player with hotels spread from Old Kent Road to the Angel of
Islington. It is a high-percentage, modest-dividend strategy, and next
to the house it has a semi-monotonous certainty of success. Sam audits
red and blue chips in neatly accumulating stacks before each roll.
His lady friend squeezes his arm and watches spotted ivory glazing
over illuminated green baize. The spell holds in this casino on the
cruise ship Star Odyssey. Spectators applaud. An expressionless croupier
skims the table and cargoes Sam his rent.
He is conspicuous because in the prevailing idleness of a luxury
cruise he doesn't gamble for frivolity, for long-shot kicks. Others
wrestle abstractly with one-armed bandits or come to the tables to lose
as quickly as they can at blackjack. They hand over 50 dollars for 15
minutes with a strict governess called Marie who deals the cards, or
they mutter it is time they cut their losses and called a cab home,
prolonging their bored penance with the excuse that a taxi fleet does
not yet feature among the pamperings of the Star Odyssey.
Outside in the blackness the Caribbean Sea is spun around our large
vessel like a roulette wheel. We succumb to the illusion that we are the
fixed focal point in this game, the silver ball flirting over swell and
commotion. We sailed from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The first rotation
of the wheel brought us to Key West. The second to Cozumel off the
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The third to Grand Cayman. The fourth will
fetch us up on Ocho Rios, Jamaica.
Cruising is the most sedated form of travel. Camel, pack mule, cart,
barge, and bicycle are all slower, but never as complacent. If they
could fly jet planes which offered deckchairs slung out along the wings
for breeze-refreshed sunbathing there might be some comparison. If they
rearrange aircraft cabin space to present broad aisles for lazy
promenading, golf-driving cages, plunge pools, whirlpools, gymnasia,
fitness centres, massage rooms, hair salons, boutiques, paddle tennis
courts, saunas, cinemas, theatres, a choice of bars and restaurants, and
seal this hermetic world with its own casino from which patrons could
amble home to private staterooms and cabins, then they too would
encounter the passenger who has lost the urgency to arrive. They could
fly circles in warmer climes and land only occasionally as a diversion.
That approximates to cruising.
The only criticism of the beautifully equipped Star Odyssey was its
stabilisers. The big ship was far too steady. You need at least some
agitation of the means of travel to confirm that progress is being
earned across the surface of the globe, otherwise there is a danger of
the whole business becoming a little too soporific. Depression Gordon
(they are evidently running out of aggressive names for hurricanes) had
abated by the time we boarded, so there was little prospect of
witnessing passengers being hurled into heaps about the decks, or of a
great epidemic of seasickness, but something was needed to shake things
up. Our demure progress across the glinting Caribbean was interrupted
only by the occasional sighting of a blister of island on the horizon.
That was as near as we would ever get to Cuba.
It is not the world-weary who are attracted to cruising, but the
experience does begin to induce a mild phobia of the real world. Most
travel is an anticipation. Cruising is dangerously close to a complete
satiation, something enjoyable in its own right. With each new port of
call the places on the first tenders ashore are significantly in less
demand. It is not purely a sudden trepidation over being abandoned to an
environment that demands normal currency exchanges instead of the
running tabs of the Star Odyssey, where people might not even speak
English, or where there is a more serious prospect of getting genuinely
lost than among the 11 decks of the cruise ship.
It is just that each landing begins to represent a birth trauma, and
we each fear straying out of sight of the mother ship, exhibiting about
as much self-reliance as a frogspawn. Even stolid Sam shows distinct
signs of withdrawal when finally wrenched from his methodical addiction
to sixes and eights and finds himself cast ashore.
In the self-styled Conch Republic of Key West our group crawled into
the first convenient shell. This is not difficult to find in this colony
of escapism where even President Harry Truman tried to establish an
alternative White House. It is an alternative kind of place. In Sloppy
Joe's bar they wear bandanas and parrots. We succoured on frozen
margaritas and only the most intrepid of us managed to pursue the
staggering trail left by Ernest Hemingway up to the pretty house he
lived in for most of his writing career. Arriving there to stroll the
handsome, tree-shaded porches and fondle stray cats, members of a colony
descended from Hem's pets, we were bleary with our sense of achievement.
This enterprise earned our reprieve from inspecting Mayan ruins in the
tropical monsoon that spattered our disembarkation in Mexico. We
repaired to a country club, now ordering margaritas by the pitcher, and
sought shelter in the swimming-pool until the sun finally broke through
to dry us out. It was under this anaesthetic that one of our number
provided a foot for a centipede to bite, causing the appendage to swell
to twice its original size. It took him a full day to register the fact.
Now we were living dangerously on our trips ashore. At Grand Cayman we
were asked to sign away our rights to claim compensation for loss of
limb or life. This was the last formality prior to our boarding a sleek
catamaran to take us out snorkelling. Sharks were a rarity, we were
told. Stingrays were different. There were a lot of stingrays. In fact,
they could guarantee us stingrays because the reef we were heading out
for was called Stingray City. They were tame rays, we were told.
Presumably that was why we were signing away our rights for damages.
In the shallow reef I decided I didn't like stingrays. Standing was
the worst. These revolting big black shadows came towards you under the
water, some the size of a decent cafe table. Getting in among them was
not so bad, since it is hard to scream through a snorkel. You had some
sense of where they were coming from, and they might oblige by swimming
under you. Even so, I could not repress the bitter reflection that I
could be doing this back in the womb of the Star Odyssey by taking to
the splash pool alongside a dozen suction-padded bathmats with
electrodes.
After this ordeal one of the women in our group asked if we realised
that the smallest of the stingrays were not babies but males. We had not
been getting along.
Contrary to my worst fears, fellow guests were not a major hazard on
the cruise ship. Our group was a special case. But most of the people
were fine, refuting a pessimism coloured by Evelyn Waugh's fictional
alter ego Gilbert Pinfold driven mad on his cruise by deck bores,
creaking cabins, and claustrophobia. After Miami, where we had flown to
join this Royal Cruise Line jaunt in the Caribbean, it was a relief to
get away from the cult of surface worship. Everyone on Miami Beach was
either a member of a camera team, a model, or auditioning. That there
was an undeniable seniority about the age profile on the Star Odyssey
was OK. Besides, after three days at sea everyone's level of animation
drops.
People-watching becomes one of the most compulsive entertainments
aboard a cruise ship. After a multimillion-dollar rebuilding and
refurbishment on joining the Norwegian-owned Royal Cruise Line fleet,
the Star Odyssey (formerly the Royal Viking Star) takes 750 passengers.
The two ladies in the stateroom next to me had demanded more coathangers
when they boarded at Fort Lauderdale. I counted 60 in my identical
accommodation, and over the following days, afternoons, and evenings it
was a point of fascination to speculate if they would ever exhaust their
wardrobe through a series of hourly costume changes.
Inventing identities for faces was another amusement. The
distinguished couple with the immaculate table manners, he in tuxedo and
pigtail, she a glamorous 50, turned out to be a famous entertainer from
Montreal and his manager wife. The little solitary man with a white cap,
pensive and watching, was revealed as a stand-up comedian. I never found
out what Sam's job was, or had been, because his new identity as the
cruise's professional gambler had become too strong to admit any other.
Even the socially autistic members among our group were less of a
liability on the ship. On dry land they would huddle together under
their sunbonnets, stare at their sandals, and await the same
life-support service provided by our genial Greek crew at sea. It was a
relief to get them back on board. Every time the anchor lifted so did
our spirits. Days at sea were bliss, free from cares and detailed
excursion missions.
Through this sweet torpor the ship's Tannoy, like something out of
MASH, kept up a wonderfully ignorable series of announcements about
whist drives, donkey derbies, ping-pong tourneys, shuffleboard
knockouts, fitness programmes, Spanish lessons, Start Your Own Business
schemes, concerts, jigsaw-puzzle gatherings, manicure sessions, how to
make A More Confident You and, most risible of all since Sam was now
conducting his own classes, free casino instruction.
We met the cruise director responsible for this soothing programme of
inessential activities. His name was Fernando, a fat Portuguese with a
voice like melted peanut butter. His staff edited the Star Odyssey Times
which was issued free each morning and brought us the front-page lead,
in the only issue I actually read, that President Clinton's vacation had
come to an end and he was returning to office. They had also listed me
as Ms Joan Linklater, though I had long since ceased to worry about
that, even when an invitation arrived one afternoon for Ms Joan to join
Captain Dmitrios Chaidoulis for cocktails and dinner at his table.
The captain was an old-school charmer. He paused with ambassadorial
gravity before delivering a sentence or approving the wine, and he
twinkled a lot. Nothing could have been more reassuring than the way he
carried his poise at a steady 18 knots. At the end of the evening he
excused himself with his duties. He was a perfect gentleman.
Ocho Rios was our final port of call. If the cruise experience offers
a more developing interest in people than tourist locations visited,
perhaps best employed as an opportunity to reconnoitre places to which
you would happily return for a fuller exploration, then Jamaica
confirmed the idea magnificently. The Star Odyssey was continuing its
cruise on to Panama, but our group was lucky enough to have found one
paradise that made jetsam of all further itineraries.
It helped that we had been brought for a few nights to the nearest
thing to a luxury cruiser on dry land. The 45-acre Ciboney spa and beach
resort is an all-inclusive deal where every drink and meal, every
additional service, is provided free and even tipping is prohibited.
This takes some absorbing, even after the kind of indulged regime of the
cruise ship, and it breeds a kind of strange tentativeness. There were
four bottles of spirits provided in my private villa, with the maid's
promise of their being replenished, but I was too petrified to make that
kind of a start. I was too absorbed to hang around the villa much to
touch them.
What kind of resort has 90 swimming-pools? I only swam in five of
them, and spent one night in a hot pool. If you got disoriented one of a
shoal of little mechanised golf carts would pick you up and deliver you
to your required destination. In such an environment you would have had
to work seriously to bore yourself, but the guilt factor threatened to
become oppressive. I had to break through the high-security perimeters
to get some kind of compass reading on reality, spending a Sunday
wandering through the markets, climbing the hill above the town to smell
the lemon and all-spice trees and cool myself in a stream. Walking back
down through the shanty town I saw a Sunday-school class with the
children dressed in white under a shade of blazing hibiscus.
The drive over the mountains to Kingston, where we began our flight
home, was full of promises that one day I mean to keep. Sometimes you
don't need to place your bets at the craps table to find a winner.
* John Linklater flew to Miami and from Kingston with American
Airlines, joined the Royal Cruise Line excursion of the Mayan Caribbean
and Panama Canal on Star Odyssey, and stayed at the Radisson Villa, Spa,
and Beach Resort of Ciboney, Ocho Rios, Jamaica.

HOW often do you hear business people in this part of the world talk
about putting something back into the community which gave them their
chance? The answer has to be ''rarely'' -- if at all.
The concept came to mind the other day when I found myself asking a
well-known business guru to deliver a keynote address at a conference.
He accepted with alacrity but declined a fee, saying succinctly: ''It's
payback time.''
That's an admirable stance that we tend to associate more with
America, where successful entrepreneurs will fund extensions to their
old schools and give millions to charity.
That type of payback tends to attract in turn another payback for the
donor in the form of status and recognition, something they are very
keen on. Wealthy people are hardly starved of such rewards when they
make it big in the US.
But while the term ''community payback'' is heard little in Scotland,
it does exist on a considerable scale. Up and down the country business
people give substantial chunks of time and expertise to a wide range of
unpaid or poorly paid commitments, including quango boards, charities,
the church, education and sport.
You'll note I did not mention donations of cash. They make those too,
but in many ways money is the least precious gift a business person can
give. Their time and talents can be the catalyst that enables a good
cause to rake in much larger sums than any single donation could
produce.
Some of these people have retired and have that time available.
However, the great majority are still in harness and just add the
responsibilities to their existing pile.
For instance, the leading lights of two of our largest indigenous
private companies both took on major unpaid commitments in the
enterprise world. I shall never understand how Fraser Morrison, chairman
of his family's #220m construction and development group, found time to
chair Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
Yet he's done it now for two years, during which time an already
well-organised agency has become highly focused and effective. Lest you
think his own company suffered on the basis that something had to give,
Morrison Group profits held up remarkably well throughout the recession,
making it Scotland's most profitable construction group as well as our
65th-largest company.
Sir Ian Wood has just stepped down after four years in the chair at
Grampian Enterprise, generally acknowledged to be one of the most
successful LECs. Although he is chairman and chief executive of the
#242m Wood Group, by a mile our outstanding oil services company, he
found the time to get the LEC up and running after the launch of the
Scottish Enterprise network.
I have asked both men how they manage it. They answered in similar
vein: ''I just put in more hours.'' More hours!
Naturally there is more to it. Both companies have strong management
teams capable of running the business with less input from the boss.
But if this is not a powerful form of community payback, I don't know
what is. Some cynics may observe that people seek out good causes so
they can qualify for a ''gong'' and the associated status. Undoubtedly
some are motivated to take on outside commitments for that reason.
Knowing Morrison and Wood as I do, such possibilities would not have
entered their minds. That Ian Wood is now ''Sir'' owes most to his
superb achievement in building one of the UK's leading offshore oil
groups out of a family fishing business.
There are thousands more examples of business people putting their
weight behind a huge number of initiatives in both the public and
private sectors. Because we do not generally make a song-and-dance about
such involvements, there is little public recognition that community
payback occurs on a substantial scale in Scotland.
One problem is the rapid growth of the quangotocracy and the growing
controversy it attracts. I suspect that a number of those who cheerfully
accepted appointments on the new breed of health service trusts and the
like are quietly regretting putting their heads above this particular
political parapet. They certainly have no intention of promoting the
fact as their contribution to the local community.
It is a shame the business world has not gained more credit for the
good work it undoubtedly performs. In the circumstances it is probably
not surprising.

Limited.

BY all accounts it was one of the most harmonious and rapidly-executed
management buy-outs concluded in Scotland for many years.
The #9.2m deal, completed just before Christmas, saw control of the
Dickie construction and housebuilding group, based on Glasgow's south
side, pass from brothers Matt and Alex Dickie to a six-man team, led by
senior executive Douglas Kirkwood.
The question of succession in family businesses, we are told, is as
often as not a minefield. Corporate history is littered with examples,
ranging from the damage done by assuming the next generation necessarily
has the skills and abilities to take the business forward, to outright
blood feuds over who owns, controls or deserves what.
Such travails don't even merit a footnote in the Dickie story, it
seems. As I related in this spot nearly two years back, Matt and Alex
Dickie were the fourth generation to run a business started in 1880 by
their great-grandfather, John Dickie.
Both had followed the family tradition of learning a trade --
surveying in Matt's case, stone masonry in Alex's -- before moving up
the Dickie ladder. When the time came, in 1964, they were expected to
buy their father out of the business.
At Dickie, nothing is handed down the generations on a silver salver,
I noted then. That tradition continues now. Among the six-man buy-out
team are Richard Potts, Matt's son-in-law, and John Dickie, Alex's son.
Douglas Kirkwood, who becomes group chief executive, is a relative
newcomer by Dickie standards, having first joined in 1987 as managing
director of the construction business. Richard Potts now takes on that
role, while John Houston continues to run the homes business. He is
assisted in that by John Dickie as developments director.
The other members of the six-strong buy-out team are George McNaboe,
group commercial director, and John McGhee, financial director.
''We've been looking at the future development of the group for two
years now,'' said Mr Kirkwood.
It wasn't a topic at each and every boardroom meeting, but Matt Dickie
was 66 and Alex had reached 60. Both men had it in mind to retire. ''We
talked about it in a very open way. There was no point not talking about
it. We had to,'' he recalls.
Last October, a consensus emerged that the time was right to proceed
with negotiations. The Dickie brothers could have gone for a trade sale.
They had had offers. After all, a business with Dickie's reputation
looks highly attractive to outside building interests seeking a quality
foothold in the West of Scotland market.
But Matt and Alex wanted to preserve the corporate ethos they and
their forebears had created. The management team was equally keen to
maintain that culture. Dickie is that kind of business, with low staff
turnover and fierce group loyalty. So the logical next step was a
buy-out by the senior management team.
Dickie's firm of auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, was asked to advise on a
deal. Andy Allan advised the MBO team. Aidan O'Carroll advised the
Dickie brothers. Only when the basic terms of the deal had been agreed
by the two sides, did Mr Allan and the MBO team go out looking for
institutional and banking support to help make it happen.
The group has a link with its banker, Bank of Scotland, stretching
back to the 1940s. Dickie had undertaken the refurbishment of the bank's
head office in Glasgow's St Vincent Street, taking the main banking hall
back to its original splendour. The obvious banker to talk to was John
Berry, head of BoS's structured finance group in Glasgow.
It was, said Mr Berry, one of the fastest deals his team has completed
in the past year. ''As their bankers, we knew the company. Our part of
the deal was all completed in less than three weeks. In London a deal of
that size might have taken three months.''
In the past, Dickie had talked to the Glasgow office of 3i about a
development project. Now the MBO team talked to 3i's Kevin Lyon about
equity backing to help buy the business. The result was #2.3m of equity
funding from a syndicate led by 3i, to underpin the #9.2m transaction.
Mr Lyon is full of praise for Dickie's quality as a company and for
the solidity of its management. ''The company has performed consistently
through recent years and is now well placed to grow significantly. We
are delighted to have invested in a buy-out which maintains an important
thread of continuity for staff and customers alike,'' he said.
Critics might argue that the Dickie deal all sounds a bit too cosy,
from first to last. From John Berry's perspective at the bank, it's a
prime example of how mutual trust in business can deliver the right
results for all concerned.
''At the moment,'' said Douglas Kirkwood, ''as far as the outside
world's concerned, it's business as usual at Dickie. We have a definite
set of objectives about how we want to take the business forward. We
have no wish to venture into the unknown. This is a company which is
stable, knows what it plans to do and plans to carry these objectives
out.
''That's what our staff, our backers and, certainly, our customers are
looking for. We all want a company which will still be here in another
120 years time.''
Mr Kirkwood trained as a quantity surveyor in Glasgow, joined a
professional office in the city, and then decided he preferred a career
in contracting. He went off to Muir in Kilmarnock for a first taste of
the business then, two years later, moved on to a Scottish national
contractor, Whatlings.
After two years he was posted to Gibraltar, to manage Whatlings
outpost there, a business established on the Rock before the border
crossing to Spain was closed.
A two-year assignment stretched to five years. He not only gained
experience of running a stand-alone subsidiary, working for the local
administration, the Property Services Agency and private clients, but
also wrestled with management problems such as the TGWU's attempts to
gain pay and conditions parity with UK workers. In addition, he gained
boardroom experience as resident director for the international arm of
Whatlings.
In 1980, he made a personal decision to get back to Scotland and
joined Frank Lafferty's building empire, first as chief surveyor, then
as surveying director. Mr Kirkwood stayed five years and recalls it as a
very dynamic time.
''But eventually my view of the future direction of the company
differed from the rest of the management, so I moved on,'' he said. He
joined James R Knowles, a construction contract consultant, and it was
there that he first came into contact with John Dickie &amp; Son, as it was
then known.
''I advised Dickie on a few contractual problems and eventually Matt
and Alex invited me to join them, to run the construction side of the
business.''
As early as 1987, the brothers were already thinking of the longer
term for the group, refocusing Dickie's operations into two separate
strands, construction and homes.
Even then, construction was the bigger business in volume terms,
turning over some #3m out of a total of #5.5m. But homes was the much
more profitable arm. ''They are,'' said Douglas Kirkwood, ''two
completely separate cultures, two different ways of doing business and
looking at business.''
In 1990, the group structure was reformed, with construction and homes
becoming separate trading businesses. Mr Kirkwood built up his team in
construction, bringing in some new blood and growing the business to the
#12m turnover it achieved last year. Construction has also gained BS
5750 Part 2 approval (now ISO 9000).
He believes the construction side of Dickie has now emerged from under
the group's original public reputation as a quality home builder, to
establish a separate identity of its own.
Homes has continued to build and sell, despite the recession, and is
currently marketing houses on three sites, two in Newton Mearns, one in
Milngavie.
Dickie's philosophy on the homes side hasn't changed. The aim is still
to build homes towards the top end of the market which the company's
executives would be happy to live in themselves. There is one
progressive change, from flats to detached houses, from homes those with
their families off their hands might gravitate towards to homes for
growing families.
''We've come through three difficult years in the industry,'' said
Douglas Kirkwood. ''Particularly in construction where we've seen a
number of casualties. But our construction business has continued to
perform well and our houses continue to sell.''
Reflecting on the deal just done, he said everything was planned to
happen as if it were a construction project. ''Things had to happen on
particular days. And they did. In October we targeted December 16 as our
completion date. We actually finalised things on December 15.'' Not many
MBO teams could say that.

It seems that there are some small gains to be made by having money in
building societies which are the subject of takeovers by other
institutions. I would be grateful if you could advise me as to which
societies are most likely to be taken over in the near future and what
kind of account I should open to be in a position to take advantage of
any share issue which might result following the takeover.
* The problem here is that any society contemplating a merger or
flotation in the next year or so may predate the membership requirement
before now, so that it would already be too late to open an account.
However, if you already have money in a building society there will be
no harm in spreading it around several societies just in case, putting
at least #100 in each. As to which societies are likely to be taken over
or float on the stock market your guess is really as good as anyone
else.
There has been talk that the Woolwich and the Alliance &amp; Leicester are
contemplating moves on smaller societies but this is only speculation.
Apart from the Nationwide, the remaining societies with over 100
branches are Birmingham Midshires, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Bristol &amp; West,
Britannia, National &amp; Provincial, Northern Rock and Portman. It is a
fair assumption that investing in one or more of these societies will
pay off but which one is anyone's guess.
As to which account you should open it must be a share account rather
than a deposit.
* My mother died last June after a lengthy spell in hospital. She had
previously decided to transfer her house to her immediate beneficiaries
so that we could manage and maintain the property. We discussed this
with the solicitor and signed the documents three months before my
mother died.
We now find that capital gains tax will take #10,000 or more from the
property and that this would not have been the case had the house come
to us through the terms of the will. Is there anything we can do about
this situation?
* You appear to be aware that capital gains tax does not apply on
death and are worried that because the house was transferred earlier,
either tax will be payable on the transfer or you will be deemed to have
acquired the property at the original cost price rather than the market
value at date of death and will therefore have a higher gain when the
house is sold.
From the information you have provided, it appears that the house was
your mother's main residence and therefore the transfer to you would be
exempt from capital gains tax purposes and not tax payable at the time.
In addition, you will be treated as having acquired property at the
market value at date of transfer which due to the time scale involved is
unlikely to be significantly different from the value at date of death.
If you have now sold or intend to sell the house, the gain arising
will be the difference between the sale proceeds and the value at date
of transfer. It is therefore unlikely that #10,000 of tax will be
involved and there may in fact be no liability if the house has been
used as the main residence of yourself or another beneficiary or if the
total gain is less than the annual exemption level of #5800.
* In September 1994, on the advice of an independent financial
adviser, I took out two unit-linked single premium bonds. I invested
#10,000 in the Sun Life Distribution Bond and #10,000 in the Norwich
Union Investment Bond. I wanted long-term growth with the possibility of
taking income if my circumstances changed. I do not need the money in
the foreseeable future, but do not want high-risk investments. I now
feel that I might have been better investing elsewhere.
Would you advise me to surrender these policies within the next few
months and put the money into unit or investment trusts, perhaps
including a PEP? I am in my early fifties with no dependants and have
taken early retirement. I am a basic rate taxpayer.
* You seem to have had a quick change of mind about what investments
best suit your needs, but it can be expensive to change horses in
mid-course.
Given your objective of long-term growth and your statement that you
do not need the money in the foreseeable future it would have been
better had you purchased investment and unit trusts instead of insurance
bonds.
You have given us only limited information about your financial
circumstances, except that you took early (very early, in fact)
retirement and you are a basic rate taxpayer.
It may be that you have other savings and investments, since you do
not need extra income at this stage. If so these should be taken into
account in determining the most appropriate investment strategy for you.
Investments bonds have an inferior performance record to investment
and unit trusts, and it is regrettable that some financial advisers
recommend putting such large chunks of money into them without regard to
the desirability of having a decent spread of interests.
Since, however, you only bought your bonds in September you have
hardly given them a chance to perform for you, and you would incur
substantial buying and selling costs by switching.
Despite this, you may want to bite the bullet, but an alternative
would be to run down your exposure to the bonds gradually and use the
proceeds as they come in to build up a portfolio of investment and unit
trusts. A spread of up to 10 might be appropriate for funds of around
#20,000.
* I would be glad to have your advice on the following. Between 1970
and 1990 I was employed in what was then West Germany by various German
companies. During this period I paid quite a substantial sum into their
state earnings-related pension fund. I returned some four years ago and
have since been in employment with a local government authority and am a
contributor to their superannuation scheme.
My question is since I have no intention of ever returning to Germany
at this late stage of my life would it somehow be possible to have my
pension rights transferred from Germany and invested in some form or
other in this country, or would it be advisable to leave them be until
retirement.
* As far as we are aware it is not possible to do this and even if it
were it would probably not be a good idea. To have part of your eventual
pension paid in German marks will be a valuable asset which you should
hold on to.
When you retire you will be invited to supply details of your
contributions to the German state scheme. Then the DSS here and its
German counterpart will swap information on your contribution record and
each country makes two calculations. Each works out the amount of
pension payable under its own scheme only.
Secondly, your records are combined and each country works out what
would be payable if your contributions in both countries had been paid
into its own pension scheme. Each country would pay a pension in the
same proportion to the contributions received by its scheme.
In other words, if your German contributions represented a third of
the total contributions made there and in the UK then a third of your
pension would come from Germany. The results of the two calculations are
compared and the one which produces the highest pension selected. The
German portion of the pension would be paid direct by its pension
scheme.
* My self-employed brother in his late thirties has a personal pension
plan with Standard Life. He has contributed #2400 since inception four
years ago. The present value of the plan is #2600 with a transfer value
of #2150.
In view of this performance, I have suggested that he might want to
consider an alternative investment such as a low-running cost Alliance
PEP. He cannot afford the #100 monthly contributions of the new
investment trust pension schemes. Would you agree with this suggestion
how we should handle the pension?
* The Standard Life policy has performed disappointingly because of
the heavy initial costs of setting up the plan and because investment
returns have been lower than they were in the 1980s, which were
exceptionally good years.
The policy is now over the hump of the charges and should now perform
better. Standard Life has a good track record and your brother should
stick with the policy which must be viewed as a long-term investment.
When he is able to pay more towards his pension he should certainly
consider a low-cost personal equity plan as this can be a valid
alternative to a personal pension policy. The advantages of having a
lump sum at the end which can be turned into tax-free income can offset
the benefit of tax relief on pension contributions.
* I have a portfolio of shares and unit trusts, worth about #220,000,
which has built up well since I inherited it nine years ago. I have just
retired and my stockbroker has recommended that the bulk of my #75,000
pension fund lump sum should be invested in gilts to give me income. I
know little about the risks and rewards of this type of investment, and
wonder if I would be wise to accept my broker's advice?
* If you need extra income to enjoy your retirement you should accept
your stockbroker's advice. Returns of over 8% can be obtained from
investing in Government stocks. This contrasts with the 4% average
return on equities. Investing around 25% of your total capital in gilts
would be consistent with running a balance portfolio.
Conventional gilts offer a relatively high fixed income. Their market
price fluctuates, mainly in accordance with perceptions on interest
rates and inflation.
In this sense they vary from building society deposits where you
cannot lose any of your capital. Gilt-eged investment can result in
profits or losses, though these are usually lower than with equities.
If gilts are bought at or below #100, risks are minimised since the
Government is guaranteeing to repay the #100 in full at the redemption
date. A spread of maturities and dividend payment dates is desirable.
The gilt-edged market can ensnare the unwary, and it is wise to be
guided by professionals who understand it. More than any other type of
stock market investment it is essential to take advice.
Another option is to review your portfolio of equities to raise the
overall yield. This would be most likely to be appropriate if its
current yield was below the market average.

THE Apollo Training Week, which introduces aspiring tournament
professionals to the trials, tricks, and treats of the PGA European Tour
trade finished at the San Roque Club, near Gibraltar this week with one
of those contests which sets experts at one sport in competition with
those of another.
Thus Steve Backley, the former javelin world record-holder, Mick Hill,
the current British champion and their trainer John Trower took on a
representative selection of golfers in trying to hit full toss the
100-yard distance marker on the practice ground by respectively throwing
and hitting balls at it.
Although denied one of the golf shaft manufacturers' other products,
the javelin athletes came closest, in a strong left-to-right wind, to
striking the target. Deadlock was broken in a sudden-death free-for-all
by Swedish golfer Kenny Cross, although what it all proved was difficult
to determine.
* THE view of a golf course from fairway, rough, bunker or green is
very different from the one developed outside the ropes. Having played
Valderrama for the first time this week, this observer is now in more
sympathy than he once was with those players who toil in the Volvo
Masters each October.
Shots have to be hit either to avoid being stymied by the welter of
cork oak trees, with their insidiously spreading branches, or to be on
the ''right'' side of the hole with such unrelenting accuracy that
scores in the high 70s and low 80s by professionals are understandable.
There also came the realisation that the task of moving large
galleries in pursuit of few games in the 1997 Ryder Cup match will need
much thought and probably more expenditure. Bottlenecks abound but John
O'Leary, of the European Tour Board, is confident that both
contingencies will be met.
* WITHIN 48 hours of Severiano Ballesteros having been denied relief
from a hole at the base of a tree at the eighteenth in the final round
of the latest Volvo Masters, on the grounds that there was no evidence
it had not been made by a burrowing animal, the offending cavity had
been filled in.
Inspection of the site the other day appeared to disclose that the
culprit had returned. There were two distinct depressions, apparently
dug by a dog, who left no calling card but someone with a sense of
humour had scratched into the earth the letters GUR.
* DUFFY Waldorf posted a seven-under-par 65 to take a three-stroke
lead among the early finishers yesterday in the second round of the
$1.2m Hawaiian Open in Honolulu.
His 133 total put him three strokes ahead of John Morse (65), and
Clark Dennis (68). Chip Beck, 66, and Brian Henninger, 65, were at
seven-under 137. Mark Wurtz was on 138 and Keith Fergus shot a 72 to be
in a five-way tie at 139.
Joint first-round leader Jim Furyk was among the late starters along
with Swede Jesper Parnevik, who opened with a 70, and Northern Ireland's
David Feherty (78).
* BETH Daniel shot a one-over 73 yesterday to take a one-stroke lead
over first-round leader Barb Mucha after two rounds in the LPGA
Tournament of Champions in Orlando, Florida. Another stroke back were
Dawn Coe-Jones and Swede Liselotte Neumann. Leading scores (Americans
unless stated):
142 -- B Daniel 69, 73.
143 -- B Mucha 68, 75.
144 -- D Coe-Jones 74, 70; L Neumann (Sweden), 73, 71.
Other scores included: 147 -- H Alfredsson (Sweden) 74, 73. 156 -- T
Johnson (Britain) 76, 80.
* AMERICAN Ron Whittaker shot an eight-under par 64 at the Durban
Country Club yesterday to take a one-shot lead over Briton Malcolm
Mackenzie (63) at the halfway in the South African Players'
Championship. Leading scores (S Africans unless stated):
132 -- R Whittaker (US) 68, 64.
134 -- M MacKenzie (Britain) 71, 63.
136 -- T Johnstone (Zimbabwe) 68, 68.
137 -- W Schutte 69, 68.
138 -- W Westner 70, 68; J Kingston 69, 69.
Other British scores: 139 -- J McHenry 69, 70. 142 -- C Davison 68,
74; D Gilford 70, 72. 143 -- D Crawford 75, 68. 147 -- S Henderson 75,
72; H Clark 72, 75.

FOUR young Scots were included in the six-strong team announced
yesterday by the British Ski Federation for the European Youth Olympics
in Andorra next month.
The lucky 16-year-olds are Tessa Pirie, Michael Berkeley, Ross Green,
and Ross Baxter, all members of the KPMG Scottish team. They will be
joined by two 15-year-olds from England, Luther English and Sophie
Ormond.
Pirie's selection marks up another milestone. After three weeks'
training and racing with the Scottish team in France, where she worked
hard on her technique, she returns home today to catch up on her
schoolwork, having made her best world-ranking FIS points result yet.
She is expected to be selected to the British Alpine team for next
season, after she leaves school.
The youngsters will compete in all three disciplines at the Olympics
-- Super-G, Giant Slalom, and Giant Slalom.
* AMERICAN Ellen Breen remained undefeated among the women and former
world champion Rune Kristiansen, of Norway, finally got back on track
yesterday in the third Free-style World Cup ballet competition of the
season at Breckenridge, Colorado.
Breen, the defending champion, won for the third time this season,
scoring 26.90 points to defeat the Swedish duo of Annika Johansson and
Asa Magnusson.
Kristiansen compiled 26.10 points against 25.00 for Fabrice Becker
(France) and 24.70 for Heini Baumgartner (Switzerland), who maintained
his season lead.

WORLD snooker champion Stephen Hendry extended his unbeaten run to 13
matches with a victory over Ronnie O'Sullivan in Birmingham last night.
The in-form Scot gave himself a twenty-sixth birthday present by
beating O'Sullivan 5-3 in the quarter-finals of the #300,000
Liverpool-Victoria Charity Challenge.
Hendry, who now faces fellow Scot Alan McManus in the
best-of-11-frames semi-final tonight, was 3-1 down at the interval.
The world champion fired in a 106 break on the restart and included
further runs of 46, 58, and 36 in the following three frames as he
guaranteed at least #15,000 for his charity, the Downs Syndrome
Association.
McManus, back on form after a lean few months since his Dubai Classic
triumph in October, progressed with a 5-1 victory over John Parrott.
The world No.6, who has now secured a donation of #15,000 for his
designated charity, the Abbeyfield Development Trust, champion,
dominated the opening two frames before Parrott took the third in one
visit to the table with an 82 break.
McManus moved 3-1 ahead at the interval with a run of 46. The killer
blow for Parrott came in the fifth frame, when he escaped from a snooker
with a swerve shot, potted the last red, but went in-off.
A yellow-to-black clearance eventually gave McManus a 4-1 lead and he
finished Parrott off with a 60-break in frame six.
Rejuvenated Terry Griffiths beat Steve Davis 5-2. In the semis the
47-year-old former world champion will play the man he defeated in that
1979 final, Dennis Taylor, who beat Willie Thorne 5-1.
* ALEX Higgins's hopes of a trip to the Far East in March were dashed
after a 5-2 defeat by unknown Nick Walker in the sixth qualifying round
of the Kloster Thailand Open in Blackpool yesterday.
Scottish teenager John Higgins moved into the last 64, beating
Midlander Adrian Rosa 5-2. Other sixth-round results:
P McPhillips (Sco) beat S Lanigan (Eng) 5-1; M Johnston-Allen (Eng)
beat M Macleod (Sco) 5-2; S Lee (Eng) beat C Small (Sco) 5-2; M King
(Eng) beat B Snaddon (Sco) 5-4; S Taylor (Eng) beat D Henry (Sco) 5-3; W
Jones (Wal) beat A Fleming (Sco) 5-4; S Murphy (Ire) beat E Henderson

Motherwell 0, Hibernian 0
A DRAW at home marked an improvement for Motherwell, who had lost
their three previous matches at Fir Park, but their failure to produce
their best also marked the end of their premier-division challenge.
The same applies to Hibernian, whose own hopes of glory have been
killed off by an inability to perform outside their own patch.
All season they have managed only four goals away from home, hardly
the stuff of champions.
Motherwell and Hibs, who have been running neck and neck behind
Rangers, finished the night only a point closer to the defending
champions, but by the time the dust settles at the end of this
afternoon's matches, the Ibrox side could be 14 points in the lead.
Of course, Rangers will first have to beat Falkirk at Brockville, and
that will not be a straightforward task.
The likelihood is, however, that Motherwell and Hibs have probably
undermined their own threats which were dying in any case, and it has to
be said they are both lacking the cutting edge which wins titles.
Motherwell could not argue with that since they have now lost 11
points from their last four home matches.
Their manager, Alex McLeish, dropped keeper Steve Woods, whose form of
late had been less than inspiring, and presented Scott Howie, a #150,000
signing from Norwich City last October, with the opportunity to make his
debut.
The Fir park side also had Brian Martin and Jamie Dolan back in
defence and midfield respectively.
Motherwell might have scored after only four minutes when a slick
manoeuvre carried them down their left flank with the ball ending up in
Rob McKinnon's possession. He clipped a low cross over just in front of
Hibs' defensive line, and Billy Davies, arriving at speed, connected
well but his shot was blocked by Jim Leighton.
A few minutes later Paul McGrillen's powerfully struck shot whistled
over Leighton's bar. The keeper had a sharp glance at his team-mates,
who were looking shaky to say the least, but there was nothing soft
about Pat McGinlay when he stood his ground as McGrillen tried to run
past him and ended up on the turf nursing his jaw.
Referee Les Mottram went to take a look and his judgement that nothing
untoward had happened was greeted with derision. However, Motherwell's
supporters were silenced in 16 minutes when Kevin McAllister's corner
from the left was missed by Howie.
The ball fell to Steven Tweed whose attempt at goal was cleared on the
line by Billy Davies, but only as far as the same Hibs player, who tried
again. Davies saved Motherwell a second time by heading clear.
Leighton then had to make saves from Paul Lambert and Tommy Coyne
before Howie's goal came under threat. Gordon Hunter' shot hit Dolan and
the rebound was swiped over by McGinlay.
It was only temporary respite and Motherwell soon had the ball back in
Hibs' box where panic set in as after a poor clearance landed at
McKinnon's feet. The fullback thumped the ball twoards Leighton, who
could only parry the shot and Lambert found himself in front of a gaping
goal.
His own surprise denied him and he hit the ball wide and just before
half time, Leighton had to rush to the edge of his box and clear from
McGrillen.
Howie made an equally important save seconds later from Michael
O'Neill.
The pace was not as frantic in the second half, but Motherwell were
still creating slightly more than Hibs, who seemed to be having
difficulty in coping with the wind, which when not swirling, was blowing
against them. The Fir Park side were still trying to press forward at
every opportunity, but on one occasion they were stopped rather crudely
when Graeme Mitchell fouled Lambert. The Hibs defender was booked and
once the ball started rolling again Motherwell were quickly back on the
offensive forcing some erratic defending.
They were not being helped by some wayward finishing and McGrillen's
miss from just inside the box -- he thumped the ball almost vertically
and the wind carried his shot harmlessly behind -- was appalling.
Perhaps if he had scored, or even hit the target he would not have been
taken off in 73 minutes to be replaced by Steve Kirk.
The closest anyone came to was when David Farrell's cross from the
right was headed towards goal by Darren Jackson and Howie fumbled,
knocking the ball out only a yard to Keith Wright. He tried a header,
but this time Howie made a good save.
MOTHERWELL -- Howie, Shannon, Krivokapic, McCart, Martin, McKinnon,
Lambert, Dolan, Davies, McGrillen, Coyne. Substitutes -- Kirk,
McSkimming, Woods.
HIBERNIAN -- Leighton, Miller, Mitchell, Tweed, Hunter, McAllister,
Farrell, McGinlay, Jackson, Wright, O'Neill. Substitutes -- Evans,
Findlay, Reid.
Referee -- L Mottram (Forth).

MOST of the clubs at the top of the second division continue to be
concerned about their lack of consistent scoring.
Stenhousemuir are the leaders, but have scored just 24 league goals --
and only the bottom three in the division have fewer. 'Muir have to wait
for Tom Steel while Clyde's doubt is over their influential Keith Knox
as they prepare to travel to Ochilview.
Morton's scoring problems do not seem to be improving. The Greenock
team wait for Derek Lilley and Peter Cormack for the game against
Berwick who will be without the injured Mark Wilson.
East Fife have scored 24 goals at home but only seven away and they
are on the road to day. The Fifers who have signed Alex Hamill from
Cowdenbeath, travel to Stirling, who have midfielder Tommy Tait
suspended.
Meadowbank's new signing Colin Harris will play against bottom club
Brechin.
Queen of the South have Kevin Hetherington suspended along with fellow
defender Brian McKeown. They face Dumbarton, whose Colin McKinnon may
not have recovered from a back injury.
Third division leaders Forfar will be without suspended defender Eric
Archibald. Otherwise they have a full squad for the home game against
Queen's Park, whose defender Graeme Elder is ruled out by injury.
Alloa have Willie Newbigging and John McCormack back in defence for
the visit to Albion Rovers.
Cowdenbeath goalkeeper Neil Russell and 24-goal Mark Yardley will miss
today's game against Ross County, while managerless Arbroath visit
Caledonian Thistle.
Two Tennents Scottish Cup replays go ahead today.There's a real
Highland battle in prospect when Huntly take on neighbours Keith, with
the winners being able to look forward to a home tie against Burntisland
Shipyard.
Whitehill Welfare have a second crack at Montrose after last week's
goalless draw at Rosewell. The further incentive for the Midlothian
team, following the cup draw last Saturday evening, is that they can
expect a sizeable number of Hibs fans to make the short journey for the
third-round tie, if Welfare get through.

THE Football Association announced yesterday that Arsenal star Paul
Merson could be playing again in the next few weeks, but have laid down
stringent conditions to monitor his continuing recovery from addiction
to gambling and alcohol.
Six weeks ago Merson entered a rehabilitation clinic after confessions
that he was a gambler and an alcoholic, and had taken cocaine. But an
official FA statement yesterday said that their medical advice was that
drug abuse had been only a minimal problem in Merson's case.
The player broke down in tears as the FA announced he would be able to
play again in less than three weeks -- provided his satisfactory
progress continues as an outpatient.
But the 26-year-old England internationalist has been warned by the
Football Association he will suffer disciplinary action ''of the
severest kind'' if he goes back to his old ways. This would appear to
suggest that his career could be over if there is any slippage on his
part.
He will be continually monitored by medical experts and must attend
Gamblers' Anonymous and Alcoholics' Anonymous.
The FA laid down six points for his complete integration back into
football life:
* He will be able to train with Arsenal as from next week.
* His medical progress will continue to be monitored by specialists.
* His progress towards full fitness will be monitored by the club.
* He will be subject to random drug-testing.
* He will attend four meetings a week with support groups for the rest
of 1995.
* He will return to his rehabilitation clinic once a week with his
wife for counselling.
David Davies, the FA's head of Public Affairs, announced: ''According
to the experts he has been suffering over several years from an
addiction to gambling and alcohol and as a result his life has
degenerated into chaos.
''Drug abuse is not the heart of his problems, although the FA's
commitment to fight the evil of drug abuse remains absolute.''
A sobbing Merson said at a press conference in London: ''I have messed
up my life. I am an alcoholic. I cannot have another drink ever, but
these last six weeks are the hardest I've ever known and I've got to
believe I've grown up at last.
''My life was going nowhere but at last -- and thanks to all the
support I've had -- I'm starting to grow up.
''As soon as I accepted the problem it began getting better, but the
last six weeks are the hardest thing I've ever known.
''I've got to thank a lot of people for their support -- my family,
Arsenal, the FA, and even the Press for leaving me alone the last six
weeks.
''My life is simple from now on. I've got to go to 'GA' and 'AA' and
report regularly to the clinic. That's all it will be.
''My wife expects our third baby in six weeks' time so that will keep
me busy as well.
''I can't preach to people in my position but all I would say is that
it only gets worse until you recognise the problem.''
Arsenal manager George Graham said: ''I'm delighted to hear that all
the expert advice indicates how positive and strong Paul has been. The
first step is to get his life back in order, and football is secondary.
But, hopefully, he will soon be able to play again. I'm very
optimistic.''
Merson's discharge from the addiction clinic came on a day when Graham
signed two new strikers for #4m, Luton Town's John Hartson and Ipswich's
Chris Kiwomya.

VIKING Flagship can defy top weight and repeat last year's win in the
Victor Chandler Chase today at Ascot.
Only three horses have managed to slip past the champion two-miler in
the past two years and, although one of them, Uncle Ernie, reopposes, he
is right out of form and should not prove a threat.
By contrast, Viking Flagship has looked unbeatable in his two outings
this term, most notably when running away from Travado in the Tingle
Creek Chase first time out.
Martha's Son has yet to be beaten over the larger obstacles and gets a
lot of weight from the selection, but this is a far stiffer test than he
is used to and he may not have the pace to win this.
Southolt showed a lot of promise in the Mackeson last November before
a jumping error put him out of contention and he beat Monsieur le Cure
for third last time out at Cheltenham.
The Mar Lodge Chase represents a substantial drop in class for him and
he can break his duck for the season.
David Nicholson and Adrian Maguire should be in luck later in the
afternoon with Brownhall in the Peter Ross Novices' Chase.
This seven-year-old hit the deck on his first outing over fences but
has done nothing wrong since, rattling off a hat-trick with victories at
Leicester, Huntingdon, and Kempton.
That latest success was in the Grade 1 Tripleprint Feltham Chase, in
which he jumped his rivals into the ground to beat Mad Thyme by 20
lengths.
At Cheltenham, all eyes will be on Mysilv as she returns to the scene
of her Triumph Hurdle success, which capped a hat trick of wins for the
young mare.
Her seasonal reappearance looked better than the final placing would
suggest as she went well until the home turn and she should strip fitter
for the run.
It would need a dramatic drop in her form for her to be troubled by
today's moderate rivals in the Bromsgrove Hurdle.
Native Pride looked back to his best at Kempton's Christmas meeting
when he had a decent field strung out behind him.
Kim Bailey's stable is in top form and his gelding can follow up in
the Hall of Fame Chase.
Mere Class turned in a good performance last month on his first run
for a year and was beaten only a length, but on a line through
Willsford, he has something to find with selection.
The Ladbroke looks as hard to call as ever, but Jim Bolger's Riszard,
once a Royal Ascot winner, looks a good each way prospect.

HUNTLY'S manager Steve Paterson has told his players they face one of
the biggest matches in the club's history in the Scottish Cup today.
The Highland League champions take on neighbours Keith in a second
round replay, and, with the winners at home to Burntisland Shipyard in
the next round, the Huntly manager reckons there is a clear path to the
cup's last 16 if they win at Christie Park.
Keith will give a debut to keeper Ross Cathcart, who signed a
one-month deal from Ross County. He takes over from the injured Ian
Thain.
One other replay goes ahead today. Whitehill Welfare have a second
crack at Montrose after last week's goalless draw at Rosewell. The
winners are at home to Hibs next time.
Meanwhile, most of the of the clubs at the top of the second division
continue to be concerned about their lack of consistent scoring.
Stenhousemuir are the leaders but have scored just 24 league goals --
and only the bottom three in the division have fewer. 'Muir have to wait
for Tom Steel while Clyde's doubt is over their influential Keith Knox
as they prepare to travel to Ochilview.
Morton's scoring problems do not seem to be improving. The Greenock
team wait for Derek Lilley and Peter Cormack for the game against
Berwick, who will be without the injured Mark Wilson.
East Fife have scored only seven goals away and they are at Stirling
today. The Fifers have Alex Hamill, signed from Cowdenbeath, while
Stirling's Tommy Tait is suspended.
Meadowbank's new signing Colin Harris will play at Brechin, who may be
without defenders Frank Conway and Brian Mitchell.
Queen of the South have Kevin Heatherington suspended along with
fellow defender Brian McKeown against Dumbarton. Third division leaders
Forfar will be without suspended defender Eric Archibald for the home
game against Queen's Park.
Cowdenbeath goalkeeper Neil Russell and 24-goal Mark Yardley, sent off
in the Cup defeat at Cove, and will miss today's game against Ross
County, whose midfielder Robbie Williamson is doubtful. Managerless
Arbroath visit Caledonian Thistle.

FRENCHMAN Pierre Lartigue moved closer to a second Paris-Dakar rally
title by winning the twelfth stage in the Guinean forest yesterday.
Lartigue, last year's winner, was fastest in his Citroen in the day's
muddy, 628km haul from Bakel in Senegal. Team-mate Ari Vatanen of
Finland trailed him by 2min 20sec.
Fourth place allowed 1993 winner Bruno Saby, driving a Mitsubishi, to
take second place overall from team-mate and fellow Frenchman
Jean-Pierre Fontenay, who lost time because of a broken radiator.
With two days remaining, Lartigue has an almost impregnable lead.
Three times winner Stephane Peterhansel of France, riding a Yamaha,
took the lead in the motorcycle section by winning the stage by more
than 19 minutes from overnight leader Jordi Aracarons of Spain.
Peterhansel, handed a 10-minute penalty for receiving illegal
mechanical assistance during a refuelling stop on Thursday, is 6min
53sec ahead of Cagiva rider Arcarons overall. Standings:
CARS
1, Pierre Lartigue (France) Citroen 58hr 56mins 08sec; 2, Bruno Saby

FYNEGOLD, a gold exploration company with interests near Tyndrum, has
been bought by a Canadian group in a deal worth more than #2m.
Caledonia Mining Corporation of Toronto has agreed to acquire Fynegold
for C$4.25m and 500,000 Caledonia shares. The transaction is expected to
be completed within two weeks.
Fynegold has precious metal exploration and development licences and
rights covering approximately 60,000 acres in the central highlands,
stretching north from Loch Fyne for a distance of about 25 miles.
It has just completed a feasibility study for the development of a
mine at Tyndrum, where exploration and underground development work has
outlined proven, probable and possible reserves of 750,000 tonnes at
7.99 grams per tonne gold and 42.99 grams per tonne silver.
Caledonia said it considers the potential for finding additional
reserves in the area to be very good.

NEWS that outgoing Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini was to be Italian
Prime Minister-designate was welcomed in the currency markets and the
lira ended near its high point of the day.
Mr Dini stressed that the next Italian government would tackle the
budget deficit, pensions and electoral reform which was what the market
wanted to hear.
The Spanish peseta also improved on its previous levels following
widespread talk of Spanish intervention to support the battered
currency. There was no confirmation from the Bank of Spain.
Sterling was again out of the spotlight and ignored
worse-than-expected UK trade deficit data for October. Several important
UK economic pointers are published next week.
The pound was over half-a-cent cheaper than the dollar at $1.5675 but
rose almost a third-of-a-pfennig.

ROLLS-ROYCE'S East Kilbride plant is to share in new contracts worth
#150m which the aero-engine manufacturer announced yesterday.
The maintenance operation, Rolls-Royce Aero Engine Services, has been
awarded the work in contracts lasting five years.
East Kilbride will do overhaul work on Tay and V2500 engines used in
10 Fokker 100 and two Airbus A320 aircraft, which are owned by China
Eastern, an airline operating out of Shanghai, and Airtours, the UK
holiday operator, respectively.
Maintenance work on RB211 jets used in TriStars operated by American
Trans Air, a Minneapolis carrier, will be carried out at Rolls-Royce's
Derby location. The group's East Kilbride site employs about 1500
people.
''We are delighted that three major operators have all displayed such
confidence in our service and capability by opting to place long-term
contracts,'' said Bert Beattie, managing director of Rolls-Royce Aero
Engine Services.

HAMPDEN might well be the spiritual home of Scottish football, but
Celtic manager Tommy Burns had to admit yesterday that it is not home
for the club using it as a temporary base this season. ''The pitch is
lovely for playing good football, and there are no excuses for not
playing well on it,'' he said, ''but it is not the same as at Parkhead.
The atmosphere is different.''
The manager was at pains to emphasise that none of the team's problems
could be put down to being decanted while their house is redecorated,
but he did add that everybody looked forward to getting back to Parkhead
next season.
He points out, too, that visiting teams like the idea of a day out at
Hampden. That is not to say he expects anything other than one of the
victories his team have found in short supply when they run out this
afternoon against Kilmarnock. If it is achieved, it seems likely to be
done by an extremely inexperienced line-up. Burns reported six virus
victims yesterday, all very doubtful, and four or five young men who
were reserve players a few weeks go could make up the bulk of the side.
The illness has hit Brian O'Neil, Peter Grant, Tony Mowbray, Mike
Galloway, Paul Byrne and young keeper Stewart Kerr. Burns did not sound
optimistic that any would be fit, but is hopeful that if he brings in
more bright young men to the side they will do just as well as Brian
McLaughlin, Stuart Gray and Jim Slavin.
He adds Garry Carberry and Chris Hay to the squad and it is possible
both will take part.
Also back in the running today are Mark McNally, after injury, Tosh
McKinlay, Charlie Nicholas, Willie Falconer and Simon Donnelly. And
Burns must choose a partner for new boy Pierre van Hooydonk, who has
given the fans such a lift.
Burns also said there was ''nothing happening'' in response to reports
of a swop deal involving Willie Falconer going to Killie and Andy Millen
moving to Parkhead.
Kilmarnock have been one of the many teams who have done well at
Hampden against Celtic, but manager Alex Totten thinks they can do even
better. ''I believe if we keep our concentration all the way through we
can win.'' Killie will be without Neil Whitworth, who is suspended, but
Mark Skilling is back and Tom Brown returns to the squad.
Rangers manager Walter Smith will not be asking Maurice Johnston, who
has been the subject of interest from Watford and Airdrie, to return to
Ibrox for a second stint in an Ibrox shirt. ''I did give it serious
consideration,'' he said, ''but I felt it was not a step in the right
direction. I don't like going back for someone who has been here
before.''
One of those Smith did make an exception for in that context, Trevor
Steven, is in the squad for the game at Falkirk for the first time this
season after having recovered from a long-term injury, but at best he
will be a substitute.
In the team will almost certainly be another man who has not been fit
for action for a while, keeper Ally Maxwell, who has not played since
early August. Charlie Miller, who has missed a couple of games, will
also be back but, otherwise, the side will be much the same as drew with
Partick Thistle last week.
That means the list of absentees continues. But there was good news of
Mark Hateley who will not now need an operation on his groin injury. He
could be back in full flow in a fortnight. Ally McCoist is also two
weeks away from a return, and the same could be said of Gordon Durie
who, apart from being injured, also happens to be suspended for two
games.
Basile Boli should be fit to play next week, while the same applies to
Richard Gough. And Alexei Mikhailchenko will be fit to start playing
again in a couple of weeks. Young striker Kevin Fotheringham is brought
into the squad as a reward for encouraging reserve displays.
Falkirk will be without injured Joe McLaughlin and suspended David
Weir but will not lack confidence on their own patch.
Hearts manager Tommy McLean would like to see his team today complete
what has been a good week by making amends for the thrashing his side
received from Dundee United when the teams meet at Tynecastle.
Having beaten Motherwell and drawn with Celtic, Hearts seem in good
fettle to improve greatly on the 5-2 defeat by United two months ago.
John Millar replaces the injured Scott Leitch.
United, who have not won a league game at Tynecastle for almost 10
years, have Billy McKinlay and Juan Ferreira in their squad, but neither
is likely to play.
Aberdeen manager Willie Miller may recall captain Stewart McKimmie for
the match against Partick Thistle at Pittodrie if there is no reaction
to his ankle injury.
Thistle will be without suspended Roddy Grant, but Wayne Foster may be
back.

SAATCHI &amp; Saatchi shares dragged themselves off the floor yesterday,
encouraged by news of an account win.
They closed 5p up at 102p after its American-based Bates Worldwide
network won the account for Lucky Strike cigarettes from BAT Industries.
The deal is thought to represent billings of $100m and revenue of $10m
for Bates.
Bates is the group's most profitable network.
Meanwhile, Maurice Saatchi was taking a relaxed attitude to the writs
served by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to try and prevent him setting up his rival
agency. His spokesman, Sir Tim Bell, commented: ''I think the writs are
more for publicity purposes than anything.''
He added that Maurice would be issuing counter-writs. The group is
seeking injunctions to prevent Maurice and the senior executives who
have defected from soliciting clients or staff and to seek damages for
conspiracy to injure the group.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi expects to be in court this month but if it is
denied an injunction it might still press for damages.

<HEADLINE>Continued export growth fails to stop UK trade deficit widening    US sales show first fall for eight months</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FINANCIAL markets on both sides of the Atlantic received a modest
boost from the first fall in US retail sales for eight months.
The unexpected development was seen as a sign that the American
economy might at last be slowing down in response to six increases in
interest rates in 11 months.
Earlier another set of UK trade figures, featuring continued strength
in exports, did nothing to stop the London equity market drifting lower
in response to the currency turmoil associated with the financial crisis
in Mexico and the political upsets in Italy and Spain.
There was speculation in the City that the FTSE-100 share index, which
at one point posted a drop of 16 points, would soon fall through the
3000 mark.
But sentiment changed quickly when the US sales figures were published
in the middle of the lunch hour. The Footsie ended the day 15.1 points
higher at 3048.3 with Wall Street over 20 points ahead.
The New York market was looking for a rise of 0.7% in retail sales
last month, but instead they fell by 0.1%. In addition, the November
increase of 1.2% was revised down to just 0.2%. Even so sales jumped by
7.6% for the whole of 1994, the biggest gain for 10 years.
The December figure was marked by weakness in cars, building materials
and clothing. Reduced demand for big-ticket items pointed to belated
success for the Federal Reserve Board's tighter monetary policy.
It is always dangerous to read too much into one month's figures,
especially retail sales where the initial survey has only 50%
penetration and subsequent revisions can be greater than the monthly
changes.
The Fed is still expected to raise rates again after its open market
committee meets at the end of the month with employment data still
indicating robust activity. Some of the dollar's weakness this week can
be attributed to fears that the Mexican crisis might incline the central
bankers to stay their hands.
The UK is not as far down the road as the US in the process of using
higher rates to take some of the heat out of the economy, though an
unexpected drop in industrial production in November could herald a
slower pace of activity.
Buoyant exports, especially to EU countries, were the most noteworthy
feature of global UK trade figures for October. The deficit widened from
a revised #549m to #644m, but the shortfall, excluding oil and erratic
items, edged lower to #929m.
By value underlying exports rose by 7% in the latest three months and
were 14% higher than in the same three months a year ago. Imports
advanced by 3% and 9.5% respectively.
By volume exports posted gains of 7% and 13% respectively on the
three-monthly comparisons, but the bulk of this was accounted for by an
upsurge in business with the rapidly recovering EU economies, where
growth rates of 9.5% and 20% respectively were recorded.
But there are signs that the devaluation effect is beginning to wear
off 25 months after sterling was forced out of Europe's Exchange Rate
Mechanism. Import volumes increased by 2.5% in the latest three months
and 4.5% in trade with the EU.
James Capel's Adam Cole reckons that hopes of further significant
improvement in the UK's trading accounts are based on wishful thinking,
but the strength of exports last year has eaten into the visible deficit
to such an extent that fears of traditional balance of payments
difficulties impinging on economic performance are well wide of the
mark.
In fact, Britain's current account has moved into the black for the
first time in seven years. In the third quarter of last year strong
invisibles converted a #1500m visible deficit into an #846m surplus on
the current account.
This made the Treasury's Budget-time forecast of a #4000m current
account deficit for the whole of 1994 look unduly pessimistic.

BRITISH Telecom is to realise #1100m from selling its small stake in
the American telecoms giant AT&amp;T through an underwritten share offering.
The 35,859,000 shares came into the group's ownership when AT&amp;T took
over McCaw Cellular Comunications, a US portable phone company in which
BT bought a 17% stake in 1989.
This takeover was completed last September and BT chairman Sir Iain
Vallance indicated at the time that it was not its intention to hold on
to these shares for long. With the American stock market holding firm,
BT has decided to go ahead and sell them.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been appointed joint global
co-ordinators and lead managers for the international offering which
will take place later this month, depending on market conditions.
The McCaw stake was taken when BT was feeling its way in overseas
expansion but did not lead on to much. However, the group is making a
reasonable profit on its investment. Judging by the present share price
of AT&amp;T, the shares are worth some #1100m, compared with the #960m it
paid for the McCaw investment.
However, BT will be able to show a much larger book profit than this
suggests as it had written off the goodwill element relating to the
McCaw purchase. On this basis, the surplus is #520m.
The money realised will reduce BT's debt from #5500m to #4400m and
free resources for other uses, such as BT's European expansion and its
multimedia ambitions. The balance sheet will retain investments worth
#2090m.
One use for the cash will be to support BT's recently announced link
with the German Viag company. This is a joint telecoms venture which
will absorb hundreds of millions of pounds in coming years. This deal
was better received by the stock market than BT's ill-focused early
moves overseas, including the McCaw purchase.
Viag is an industrial company which has only just moved into telecoms.
With its expertise, BT will be the dominant party in the new venture,
which hopes to take 15% of the German telecoms market. There is
something of a scramble to take advantage of the liberalisation of this
market, Europe's largest.
The monopoly operator, Deutsche Telekom, has a heavy debt burden and
is thought to charge relatively high prices so taking market share away
from it should not be difficult.
Further afield, BT has also recently signed a #215m partnership deal
with the Australian Government under which it will locate its
Asia-Pacific systems engineering centre in Sydney and encourage local
companies to become BT suppliers. This will place the group in a strong
position to gain an operators' licence when the Australian telecoms
market is opened to competition in two years time.
At home, another investment priority is the development of multimedia
services, such as video-on-demand, home shopping and interactive video
games. This will develop into a major market, though there is doubt over
how much BT will be allowed to participate in it. Because of its market
dominance, BT is banned from selling mass market broadcast services, but
there is uncertainty over the exact definition of this.

PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome was dealt a blow yesterday when a joint
US advisory committee recommended against official approval for
Wellcome's biggest-selling drug, the anti-herpes treatment Zovirax, to
be sold without a prescription over-the-counter.
It remains to be seen whether the US Food and Drug Administration, the
licencing authority for medicines in the US, decides to ignore the
advice. Although typically it has tended to follow the committee's
advice. There are thought to be serious concerns over whether people
will be able to diagnose the condition themselves.
It is possible that Wellcome could try to persuade the US regulatory
authorities to think again but another meeting is unlikely to take place
before six months. The refusal throws into doubt the terms of Wellcome's
agreement with Warner-Lambert, its new US partner.
City analysts had feared that the approval would not be given, dashing
potential sales of between #300m and #500m a year. The market for
over-the-counter (OTC) Zovirax is estimated to be worth around $400m
(#255m) per year. OTC Zovirax is available in the UK and has sold well
in the anti-cold sore market.
Along with other pharmaceutical companies who own major blockbuster
drugs, Wellcome is keen to expand the profitable life of its drug
portfolio through line extensions and different formulations. Zovirax is
due to lose its patent protection in several key markets in the next few
years. The US Zovirax patent is due to expire in April 1997 paving the
way for a flood of cheaper imitations. Wellcome makes almost half its
sales in the US.
Without OTC Zovirax, Paul Diggle, SG Strauss Turnbull's healthcare
analyst, believes that Wellcome could see its earnings growth decline
from 1997 onwards. He estimates that growth would decrease to 6% from 7%
in 1997 and to zero from 3% in 1998.
Given the consolidation currently taking place in the pharmaceutical
industry, smaller companies on the world stage such as Wellcome are seen
as perennial bid targets. Yesterday's US decision will reignite
speculation about Wellcome's long-term independence.
Wellcome shares were unsettled by the news emanating from the US and
dropped 15p to 664p. Following the US announcement some analysts were
recommending that investors switch out of Wellcome into either Zeneca or
SmithKline Beecham shares.

RICHARD Fromberg bids to become the first Australian to win a pro
tennis title on home soil for six years when he faces American Patrick
McEnroe in the final of the New South Wales Open today. The last
successful Australian was Mark Woodforde in 1989.
Fromberg reached the final with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Italy's Renzo
Furlan yesterday and now meets McEnroe, who will be chasing his first
singles title after seven years on the tour.
* CLARE Wood, Britain's top player, beat Australian Louise Field 6-2,
6-3 in the first round of the women's qualifying competition at the
Australian Open in Melbourne yesterday.
Wood, from Brighton, will now meet American Audra Keller today and
must win three matches in all to qualify for the main competition, which
begins on Monday.
* PETE Sampras staved off a strong challenge from Stefan Edberg
yesterday to advance to the final of the Colonial Classic at Kooyong. He
won 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2 and meets American Michael Chang in today's
final.
Boris Becker pulled out of the third-place play-off against Edberg
with a knee complaint.
* MARK Petchey bowed out of the Indonesian Open yesterday -- at the
hands of the player he must face in the first round of the Australian
Open next week. The British No.2 from Essex lost a quarter-final 6-3,
4-6, 6-4 to Radomir Vasek of the Czech Republic.

BRITAIN'S bid to host rugby's 1999 World Cup faces opposition from
Australia, New Zealand and Japan, who yesterday announced that they will
make a joint effort to keep the event in the southern hemisphere after
South Africa stage the event this year.
Representatives from the three countries' unions met in Sydney
yesterday and agreed to lodge a formal bid, putting their plans before
the International Board by February 14.
It will be based on a 20-team competition in four pools, with the
final being held at Sydney's new 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium, while
Britain's plans have the tournament being staged in England and Wales.
The alternative has one pool based in Japan, giving that country 10
matches plus a quarter-final, and one pool based in New Zealand plus a
quarter and a semi-final there. The remainder would be in Australia.

<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of the farmers' unions in Scotland, England, and
Wales, won an agreement in Brussels yesterday for a Europe-wide approach
to the current problems over the transport of live animals to Europe.
Farmers leaders in Britain have consistently argued that the solution
to the present problems lies in persuading other members of the European
Union to adopt standards similar to our own.
UK Farm Minister William Waldegrave has put forward a set of
guidelines, and has indicated his willingness to seek the co-operation
of the authorities in Europe to monitor the actions of British drivers
during the Continental leg of their delivery journeys.
Mr Tom Brady, chief executive of the National Farmers' Union of
Scotland, was present at yesterday's meeting with representatives of
European farmers' unions.
He welcomed the decision to make a united approach to the Council of
Ministers, pressing for progress on the issue of animal transport.
When the Farm Ministers met at the end of last year, they failed to
win any agreement on the issue, and the feeling then was that little
further progress could be expected during the French presidency. Mr
Waldegrave admitted that animal welfare was not as serious an issue with
some of the European partners as it was in Britain.
The united front with the European farmers' unions is restricted to
conditions of transport, and does not cover the controversial issue of
the use of crates to raise young calves for the veal trade.
Mr John Ross, president of the NFUS, said that farmers in Scotland
would have no objection to a review of the present laws covering the use
of crates.
The problems posed for dairy farmers faced with the prospect of an
interruption to the export of calves to Europe, will be taken up with
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister Sir Hector Monro at a meeting with
the NFUS next week.
It is estimated that about 500,000 calves a year are exported from
Britain to Europe. The Scottish figure would be about 40,000, or perhaps
less because of the beef finishing tradition in Scotland.
At their meeting with the Minister, the farmers' representatives will
be pressing the point that the present disruption to the export trade is
putting farmers' livelihoods at risk. In addition, they will raise with
the Minister the question of compensation for income lost.
Earlier this week, calf prices at Swansea rose from #30 to #90, on the
news that it was planned to establish an air ferry service from Swansea
Airport.

TOM McKean returns to the job he does best today, when he races the
800 metres in the West of Scotland indoor championships at Glasgow's
Kelvin Hall.
The former World and European indoor champion came close to quitting
last autumn following a dismal Commonwealth Games. Stepping on a razor
and slicing his foot the week before the Victoria final was the
unkindest cut in a catalogue of minor injuries that troubled him all
season.
''I lost eight weeks out of 15 from May to August,'' said McKean
yesterday. ''Nothing major, but they combined to ruin my season -- the
worst I've had. Yes, I did think about quitting. But I took six weeks
off, sorted my body out, and had some great physio from the Scottish
team's Joan Watt.
''Now I am looking back at the best winter I have had in years. No
niggles, no injuries, just consistent good training. It's been
brilliant. Injuries destroy your confidence, and confidence is what
breeds success.
''I'm just looking to win the district title, to blow out the cobwebs.
It will be my first race since Victoria, and I hope to go on to run some
international races indoors.''
McKean's plans include next weekend's Scottish indoor championships,
and the UK selectors know he wishes to race against France at the Kelvin
Hall, and the USA in Birmingham. ''But no matter how well I run -- even
if I were to break the world record -- I will not do the world indoors
in Barcelona,'' he says.
His wife, Yvonne, is expecting their second child in five weeks, and
he adds: ''Having a good outdoor season is the most important thing for
me. I have no sponsorship of any kind, and need a good season to land
some help.''
Today's race, his first in the colours of Lanark and Lesmahagow, the
club he has joined after his split with Lucozade Motherwell, will be no
walkover. It promises to be the event of the day.
He faces one reigning world champion, 17-year-old Boclair Academy
pupil Andrew Young, who took gold at 800m in the World Schools
Gymnasiade last year, plus the fourth and fifth-ranked Scots outdoors
last year, Strathclyde student Ewan Calvert and Clydesdale's Grant
Graham.
Commonwealth Games women Alison Grey and Hazel Melvin look title
certainties in shot and high jump respectively.
In the East championships tomorrow all eyes will be on Doug Walker,
the New Year 110m sprint winner, who runs his first 400m in more than
five years. ''I broke 50 seconds at my school,'' sports, and had already
run five 100m races that day,'' says Walker. ''But I was competing in
800m and cross country then. I had some endurance background. Now I have
none, and 400 metres seems an awful long way.''
Mel Neef, the Scottish women's indoor champion over 400, and European
and Commonwealth finallist at that distance last year, drops down to
contest the 60 and 200m tomorrow.
* FINANCIAL constraints with Grampian Region and Aberdeen City Council
have forced the cancellation of the city's festival of Road Running, one
of the highlights of the Scottish athletics calendar.
The event brought some of the world's leading athletes to the north
east, including Khalid Skah, Ismael Kirui and Steve Cram, and provoked a
memorable acrimonious head-to-head between Liz McColgan and Yvonne
Murray.
''We intend to put our money into the grass roots, and are looking to
appoint a sport-specific development officer for athletics,'' said a
city spokesperson, Jenny Selbie.
Grampian had a three-year contract with the promoting company, Nova
which has now expired.
The Aberdeen 10,000 metres will still go ahead, however, and the city
is to back the Four Nations championship for people with disabilities
(June 25 and 26) for the first time.
* THE sports goods company, Reebok, is investing #25,000 in eight UK
cross-country events, including the Scottish national championships at
Perth on February 12, which will receive #600 plus numbers, bibs, and
course marking tape. The first event in the package is today's
inter-county championships at Luton.
The Scottish money, though welcome, will make only a small dent in the
sport's #100,000 deficit of income over planned expenditure. Painful
surgery on fixtures is imminent.
* DIANE Modahl's club will boycott a top cross country championship in
Portugal next month -- in protest at the country's role in her four-year
ban for drug-taking.
Sale Harriers, who remain convinced of the 800m runner's innocence,
have competed in the European women's club event for the past 13 years.
Modahl tested positive at a track meeting in Lisbon and her sample was
analysed at an International Olympic Committee-accredited laboratory
there. Last month, two testers from the laboratory failed to appear to
give evidence to the British Athletic Federation disciplinary hearing
which found her guilty.

COLIN Parker and Kate Milligan kept the Lion Rampant flying at
Scotland's first race meeting of the year at Musselburgh yesterday.
Parker, based at Kettleholm near Lockerbie, registered a double with
Trump and Boarding School, who both carried the colours of his principal
patron, Ray Anderson Green.
Trump rattled a four-timer when drawing right away in the Harcros
Handicap Hurdle to score by eight lengths.
The success hoists Parker's son, David, to the top of the amateur
riders' table with seven winners to his credit.
Boarding School, who unshipped his rider on his last visit to the
course, made no mistake this time in the Whiteadder Handicap Chase.
Newton Stewart-born Milligan had earlier secured the second winner of
her career with Fair and Fancy in division one of the Dyewater Maiden
Hurdle.
The Middleham trainer spent a number of years as assistant to Micky
Hammond before taking out her own licence last summer.
Meanwhile, three of the winners at Southwell yesterday showed what a
change of stables can do for a horse.
Battle-hardened pair Hawwam and Sudden Spin recaptured former glory
days but Portend had shown little before joining Mansfield trainer Roy
Bowring.
Bowring bought Portend for only 650 guineas out of Steve Kettlewell's
yard at the last Doncaster September Sales.
The gelding has won both his races since and wasn't hard pressed here
to beat Cheerful Groom by six lengths in the Ryegrass Handicap.
Hawwam rolled back the years to win the Cowslip Limited Stakes, his
first win since joining Preston trainer Eric Alston, by three-and-a-half
lengths from Orthorhombus.
Another revitalised horse, Sudden Spin, turned Division One of the
Buttercup Amateur Riders' Handicap into a near-procession. The
five-year-old lost his form for Jack Berry last season but, following a
move to Steve Norton's Barnsley stable, has landed a couple of races
over hurdles recently.

THERE will be no premature celebrations, of course, but it is
difficult to imagine Stirling County being overtaken in the chase for
their first division one title should they defeat Hawick at Mansfield
Park this afternoon.
Scotland winger Kenny Logan returns as the leaders seek to protect a
four-point lead at the top.
Stirling have had a nasty habit of losing their momentum in the second
half of the season and Hawick, for whom Jim Renwick is pulling a few
backroom strings, are notoriously mean at home.
The Greens will be boosted by the return of international flanker
Derek Turnbull, back after a spell in the ''cooler.''
It will be interesting to compare the talents of County's Ian Jardine,
required by his country against the Canadians next week, and Tony
Stanger, who is determined to make his way as a centre but, as yet, to
convince the selectors. I am sorry Stanger is not being given a run in
the A team.
If Stirling were to slip up, the main beneficiaries would be
Watsonians, who surely must be expected to triumph over lowly Stewart's
Melville at Inverleith. Scott Hastings, without whom no rugby story is
complete these days, returns at centre for the visitors.
Sadly there is still no sign of Douglas Wylie in the Colleges' side,
and coach Finlay Calder knows time and points are running out quickly.
Most new caps take off the Saturday before an international, but not
so the Dundee High School FP lock, Stewart Campbell. ''The club are
going for a place in the new first division next season and I want to
help them achieve that,'' he says.
Dundee have seven points and think 12 will be required. They are at
Gala today where Campbell can resume acquaintance with Gregor Townsend,
who will be on the same side against Canada.
The selectors might be forgiven for keeping a close watch on events at
Meggetland where six of the squad are on duty in the Boroughmuir
encounter with Melrose. Five are in Melrose colours including half-backs
Craig Chalmers and Bryan Redpath.
One internationalist who has been given the cold shoulder of late is
Boroughmuir's Derek Stark. Yet he remains the fastest wing in the
country and a couple of tries would remind influential people of that
fact.
Heriot's winger Peter Hewitt has assured me several times that he has
made his farewell appearance in the seniors. Never one to turn down a
call to arms, however, he is back on his old beat to face Currie at
Goldenacre.
It is desperate days for the visitors who prop up the table. They will
be encouraged by the return of skipper Ally Donaldson but I can't see
them making much headway.
GHK need to get back on the winning trail against Edinburgh
Academicals if they wish to stay with the big boys. There are few bigger
than Alan Watt who is, once more, asked to serve in the front row, and
deserves a medal.
West of Scotland and Jed-Forest are also gasping for points which
might make their clash at Burnbrae a tense affair. The boot of David
Barrett could be the home team's trump card.

MARK Ramprakash heads the cast list in Bangalore today when the young
Test cricket hopefuls of England A aim to prove they are ready to rise
up out of the ashes of England's Australia campaign.
Middlesex batsman Ramprakash has been given the key No.4 position in
England A's first of three five-day Tests against India A.
And John Emburey, his Middlesex colleague, and now in India as part of
the Whittingdale coaching scheme, reckons that Ramprakash has the
ability to become England's premier batsman.
Former Test off-spinner Emburey is looking for Ramprakash to dominate
more at the crease.
Ramprakash has the pressure of knowing he must show once and for all
on this tour that he is Test class.
The early signs, both in his batting and in his off-field disposition,
are that he is mentally atuned to the task ahead.
Ramprakash said: ''I have to make the most of my opportunities here.
I'm very happy with the way things are going. I have Test experience to
draw on, but I feel it is a case of relaxing more in the pressure
situations.'' Team:
England A -- N V Knight, M P Vaughan, J E R Gallian, M R Ramprakash, A
P Wells (captain), P N Weekes, D G Cork, P A Nixon (wicketkeeper), I D K
Salisbury, G Chapple, R D Stemp.
* ENGLAND'S Under-19 side ended the first day of their first Test
against the West Indies in Port of Spain on 230 for six after captain
Marcus Trescothick won the toss and opted to bat.
The pitch took spin early on and Somerset's Trescothick was caught for
seven with the score on 13 before Yorkshire pair Anthony McGrath and
Chris Schofield put on 146 for the second wicket.
McGrath's 79 and Schofield's 83 put England in a strong position at
tea, but then some excellent spin bowling took its toll.
* ENGLAND manager Keith Fletcher has given his players three days off
before they travel to Melbourne to start practising for the remaining
Tests.
They also have a four-day game against Victoria in Bendigo, which
starts on Friday.

THE Inland Revenue are to appeal against an English High Court ruling
that they have been exceeding their powers in seeking information from
auction markets on livestock sales by farmers.
The Revenue were asking for financial details, and the names and
addresses of vendors.
The Lancaster Farmers Auction Mart Company claimed that the Revenue
were not entitled to demand that information, and defended their
position in Court. Their action is now regarded as a test case, with the
outcome affecting farmers and markets throughout the United Kingdom.
Mr Richard Gaskell, of accountants Scott and Wilkinson, Lancaster,
confirmed that they had received notice that the Revenue would appeal
against the High Court decision. ''Our lawyers are now investigating the
possibility of this appeal being taken directly to the House of Lords,''
he said yesterday. ''We are determined to proceed with the case, because
we feel we are right -- and they are wrong.''
The Lancaster Market claim that, while the Revenue have extensive
powers to gather information about the affairs of a taxpayer, they must
first obtain an order from the Commissioners for Income Tax -- and
satisfy the Commissioners that there is a reasonable cause for doing so.
''Throughout the country, inspectors of taxes have been obtaining
information from auction marts, either by serving statutory demands for
these particulars, or threatening to do so,'' said a spokesman for the
Lancaster Mart.
''They wanted marts to submit every year details of every transaction
carried out during the year.''
The market company received advice from a QC specialising in tax
affairs that the Revenue did not have the powers they were claiming, and
were not entitled to demand the information. ''The directors took the
view that, while they would always meet their legal obligations, the
considerable cost in supplying the information on a voluntary basis was
not justified
''Furthermore, they felt their customers would consider it improper
for the auction mart to supply details of customers' business dealings
to the Inland Revenue.''
A hearing before the tax commissioners in London found in favour of
the auction company, and the Revenue lost their subsequent appeal to the
High Court. Accountant Richard Gaskell said that the original hearing
before the commissioners had cost the mart about #7000.
In the High Court appeal, costs had been awarded in favour of the
auction market. If the company had to meet their own costs in a House of
Lords hearing, these would be considerable, he said.
Their lawyers were, however, trying to establish if they could adopt a
mechanism which meant that the House of Lords costs would be met by the
Inland Revenue, whatever the outcome, because the market company had
twice won their case at a lower level.
The company claim that if the Revenue's arguments were upheld, all
businesses which act as agents -- including banks, building societies,
and solicitors -- could be compelled to disclose all transactions. This
could involve an enormous additional workload, and a breach of client
confidentiality.

NOT too many footballers would have left the old What's My Line panel
struggling to identify their occupation. There is an inevitable body
language, a demeanour, and a kind of footballese which invariably
betrays the ball-player's day job. But none of that is easily detectable
in the quiet, gentlemanly bearing of the young man who today plays his
last game for Rangers.
Pieter Huistra, who will be 28 next week, will leave for Japan at the
end of the month to take up another challenge, but it is unlikely that
he will be asked to prove himself on a tougher stage than the premier
division, where he has played for the past four-and-a-half years.
Slight, almost delicate looking, and wholly composed, Huistra seemed
about as suitably bred for the rigours of Scotland's macho football as
Placido Domingo for Runrig. Pieter not only survived, but won many
admirers for his skill and even more for his determination to succeed as
a Rangers player.
That application has been part of his make-up since he began playing
the game in the streets of Goenga in northern Holland. ''It was in the
early seventies, when everybody in Holland wanted to play football.''
Those were the great days of Ajax and Feyenoord's European triumphs as
well as the blossoming of the best team never to win the World Cup.
Yet, if he was captured by the football virus, there was no football
heritage to trace in the family. In fact, none of his three brothers
took up the game seriously and his father chose a much more hazardous
way to make a living. He is a journalist.
But, even if his parents were happy to see him developing his skills
as a player, they insisted that he pay due care to the academic side of
growing up and he collected the equivalent of seven highers. He tried
university, where he studied biology, in Groningen, but lasted only one
term. ''It was not for me and, anyway, by then I was ready to become a
full-time footballer.''
He had played for Groningen for three years, then a year with Veendam
before joining Twente Enschede who, before his time, had beaten Rangers
in a European tie. After a couple of years there, he had agreed a deal
with PSV Eindhoven, but it was called off when Twente asked for too much
money. ''I was annoyed, but decided to stick it for another year. Then
Rangers came in.''
He had heard about Rangers and Celtic, as well as Aberdeen where Theo
Snelders had blazed a trail. ''I knew about Scottish football, but I
didn't have a clue about what it was like.'' He was craving for what he
calls a ''real football atmosphere,'' and found it in abundance at
Ibrox. ''It was even better than I had imagined.''
Signed in August, 1990, for #300,000, Huistra, naturally, is grateful
to the man who bought him, Graeme Souness. And he has good cause to be
thankful. ''People might not realise it, but I was involved in every
game when he was manager. I was never out of the 13.
''You always have a good word for the manager who buys you, but I got
on well with him, and I always felt he had a lot of confidence in me.''
He did find the pace and ferocity of the Scottish game fairly
daunting, but reckons playing on the wings was a bit less demanding than
elsewhere. ''Also, when I was with Twente I was a marked man every week,
because by then I was playing for the Dutch international team. So I was
used to getting a lot of kicks. Not much changed in Scotland, but I had
to adjust a bit more to the pace and to learn to jump in the air to head
the ball.''
Some folk, even his admirers, would suggest he never did get the hang
of that part, but he does get annoyed when critics say he can't defend.
''I don't understand why people here think you have to be throwing
yourself into tackles to defend. You can defend much more effectively by
covering here, or there, by shepherding a player away from the danger
area and preventing an attacker getting the ball.''
He has enjoyed a more involved midfield role this season, but would
tell you that this was the one he played in Holland.
He and wife Mirjam, along with son Erik, have fitted in happily with
life in Scotland.
''People were friendly here, in Glasgow especially, from the
beginning, as long as you make an effort. You have to adjust a bit, but
not so much, when you have come from Holland.''
He had the advantage of speaking the language or, at least, so he
thought. ''I spoke a bit of English, so I was not worried, but it took
me quite a while to understand Scottish.'' However he works out at going
to Japan, he knows he is unlikely to have judged it as brilliantly as he
did his Scottish venture.
In his time here, which coincided with what might have been part of
the finest era in Rangers' history, he has won medals for four premier
division championships, two League Cups, and a Scottish Cup.
''It has been a wonderful time to be part of a club with such a big
tradition and history. But it has been like being one of a family. I
suppose it helps when you are winning.''
He would not deny that he was disppointed when it became clear he
would be allowed to leave Ibrox. ''I guess I knew last season when I was
not getting into the team. Walter Smith has to change the club and bring
in new players. It is almost a new team. I have seen a lot come and go
since I came here.''
He is also frank enough to say that if he had been offered a new
contract at Ibrox he would have signed it immediately. ''But I have been
fortunate in many ways to have been here this long. The fans have been
good to me from the start.''
He would recall with great pleasure playing alongside Mark Hateley and
Ally McCoist, and his recent rapport with the new star turn, Brian
Laudrup, has been rewarding. ''He is an exciting player and although
people thought we would be rivals for the same position, it has worked
out that we both can play with each other.''
Pieter has no doubts that Celtic's new man, Pierre van Hooydonk, will
enjoy his time in Scotland. ''He is a good player and he will do well
with Celtic. They needed somebody up front.
''He just broke through when I left Holland, but I heard about him.
The fact that he has a cap is enough to say he must be a good player.''
How much the new Parkhead man will relish the Old Firm contests
remains to be seen but Huistra won't forget them quickly. ''I enjoyed my
first one, which was probably my best, but when I realised what it was
all about then maybe I got a bit caught up in it.
''But we had a good record when I played against Celtic and I don't
expect I'll play in a game like it again. I know the hype all week got
us excited and looking forward to the match.''
He is such a professional that he will not treat his final game for
the club, against Falkirk at Brockville today, as anything special, but
recognises that it is the end of a memorable part of his career.
''The last game you play for any club is a bit sad and it will
certainly be that for me.''
Mirjam agrees. ''I will be sad to leave Scotland,'' she says, in a
delicious hybrid of an accent which combines her native Holland and
downtown Glasgow, ''but we are looking forward to the challenge in
Japan.''
Her husband has a two-year contract there, where he hopes to continue
learning about the game. ''I don't know what I will do after that, but I
might come back to Europe.'' He knows there is one place he can be sure
of a welcome.

ARE you dreading your latest credit card bill? Do you wish you could
swop your cheque book for one with a happier ending?
Official figures showing how much we all spent in the run-up to
Christmas are due next week. Opinions are divided on how big the
last-minute shopping spree turned out to be, but what is clear is that
many of us will be moving into 1995 with a large millstone of debt
hanging around our necks.
Many feel the gloom over consumer spending has been overdone -- a view
that is certainly supported by the most recent figures on store card
spending.
Plastic cards issued through large retail chains are usually
overshadowed by the more widely-used credit and debit cards, but they
appear to be increasingly popular with shoppers.
New borrowing of #527m on store cards during November last year showed
a massive 65% jump on the previous year and was even higher than 1993
Christmas spending figures.
''It's a sign of how bargain conscious shoppers have become,'' says
the Finance &amp; Leasing Association (FLA) which produced the figures.
''Store cards were heavily marketed at the beginning of last year when
new cardholders were offered discounts on their first purchase and
they've gone on to use their cards more and more.
''Shoppers feel they're getting added value through special offers
like the chance to attend sale previews before the general public,
special late-night shopping evenings and reward schemes for regular
customers,'' says the FLA.
The Sears card, accepted in a wide number of High Street outlets,
including Adams, Wallis, Dolcis and Richards, has been running a reward
scheme where shoppers qualify for a #5 voucher for every #100 charged to
the account, for example. A new scheme is expected soon.
Store cards can make customers feel they are in a privileged position
-- like members of a special club -- but whether the costs of membership
are really worthwhile is another matter.
Some store cards are, of course, vital if you want to use credit in
particular shops. Marks &amp; Spencer and the John Lewis chain still don't
accept cards like Barclaycard or Access, but don't abuse their monopoly
power by charging excessively for credit.
The John Lewis card is particularly good value. Its monthly interest
charge is just 1.39%, amounting to an effective annual rate of 18%. That
compares with almost 1.6% a month (or nearly 22% APR) on Access and Visa
cards at the Bank or Scotland and the Royal Bank, for instance.
At M&amp;S the charge is higher -- 1.7% a month if you repay by direct
debit (an APR of 22.4%) or 1.84% for other types of repayment (an APR of
24.4%).
Other cards look far less appealing. The Laura Ashley card charges
2.2% a month for extended credit, amounting to an effective rate of
almost 30%.
If you're a store card addict it makes sense to take a critical look
at what you get for your money -- particularly in the light of rumours
that the Government is planning to slap a #10 tax on each credit card we
hold.
It could well be worth amalgamating what you owe under the umbrella of
one low-cost card, for example. Taking out a personal loan or arranging
an overdraft can also mean big savings on expensive credit card debts.
Credit card balances can be transferred to the Royal Bank's special
Mastercard, for example, and repaid at the rate of 1.14% a month, an APR
of 14.5%. The interest charge rises to 1.25% a month (16% APR) if you're
transferring less than #1000 worth of debt. There's no annual fee on the
card.
A personal loan may cut costs too, but can be inflexible. If you repay
a fixed-term loan early there's often a redemption penalty. This could
amount to one or two months' extra interest or a proportion of the
interest and charges you would have paid if the loan had run its full
term.
Loans are typically available over six months or up to five or seven
years and there are usually no arrangement fees. Generally speaking, the
more you borrow, the lower the interest rate -- 13.3% at the Clydesdale
for loans over #5000, for example, up to 29.9% at Chartered Trust for a
#500 loan currently.
Look carefuly at the cost of adding ''credit insurance'' to a personal
loan to maintain the payments if you're unable to through illness or
unemployment. It's not cheap and can bump up monthly payments on a
typical #2000 loan by around 15%.
Arranging an overdraft in order to repay expensive credit card debts
can be worthwhile, but avoid going into the red without permission --
the extra costs of bank charges and higher interest make unauthorised
overdrafts a very expensive borrowing option indeed.
There are some real New Year borrowing bargains to be had on
interest-bearing current accounts. Nationwide Flexaccount customers, who
also have a Nationwide mortgage, can arrange an overdraft with a monthly
cost of just 0.7%, an effective yearly rate of 8.74%.
The cost is not much higher for current account customers with the
Alliance, Abbey National and Woolwich building societies (between
9.1%-9.5% annually) -- and there are no transaction charges either.

MARTIN Scott, who was on the bench during the Scotland A team's
confrontation with the Italians last week, gets his first game for
Orrell this afternoon after having moved there from Edinburgh Accies
just before Christmas. The game is against Leicester, and the crowd will
be around 11,000. The match is sold out. How life changes.
Last week, the news broke that Gregor Townsend has signed forms for
both London Scottish and Northampton, and Andy Nicol departed for Bath,
joining a celebrated list of Scottish rugby players in England, the most
recent of whom are Derrick Paterson and Rob Wainwright.
So why go? ''Look,'' said Scott, at home after a gruelling session,
''in Scotland I could honestly say that I was getting only one hard game
in four. I'm down here to test myself against top-class players every
week. I am not surprised at Gregor Townsend moving, either.''
He cites the approach of his new masters. ''Take tonight, for
instance. My car wouldn't start -- so they sent a taxi. Can you imagine
that happening in Scotland?
''Everybody down here is really into their weights. I go with Dewi
Morris. When we get to training on a Tuesday night there is an edited
video of Saturday's game on TV in our changing room, and we watch that,
and talk about it, before we go out. The attitude is professional. So
much preparation goes into each game.''
We know the attitude is professional, but is the rest?
''I spoke with Eric Peters, and he, like me, says there is no money at
his club. But we know it's down here all right, no doubt about it,'' he
says. ''Orrell isn't a rich club, so we don't have too many well-off
rugby players, but you can get all the kit you want, and, like Scotland,
there are the sponsored cars and individual deals to be had for lots of
lads in England.''
That professionalism comes easy in a part of England that has, on its
doorstep, a plethora of rugby-league clubs, and Orrell have frequent
liaisons with Wigan.
''Frano Botica comes down to train us -- he's amazing -- and we learn
a lot from them, and their training routines, in general,'' he says.
''That's why everybody at the club is so big into the weights, and the
power running, all from league rugby.''
My first real sight of Scott was when he scored a try for Edinburgh
Borderers in a surprise win over David Sole's World Cup team as they
prepared for the 1991 tournament. It was raw and rich potential that was
tapped only when Scotland toured Australia and he won his two caps.
Since then there has been a lean spell.
The well-worn Scottish practice of discarding players who had forced
their way into a side on tour came into force when Scott was displaced
in further A games by Gala hooker Ian Corcoran.
''It has been frustrating. I didn't seem to be getting selected, and
there have been injuries. Even now, I haven't been to a single session
in preparation for the World Cup, so that's why I'm keen to improve,''
he says.
''In comparison to the English boys, I suppose they're bigger, and I
get much lower than them in training, but I'll see how I get on against
Leicester. They seem to stay on their feet longer, and maul, whereas I
tend to get down early and ruck. What strikes me is that they don't seem
that much better than the lads I played with at all. They're just bigger
-- bigger and stronger, I suppose.''
Scott is network manager with the Army, looking after all their
communications systems in the north of England, and, like all of the
players who have taken the A74 south, the job -- it being an amateur
game, of course -- was as important as the rugby. For Scott, the job
also meant promotion.
I think that it is sad that our players feel they have to go down to
visit our English pals to get decent competition. But, for goodness'
sake, we don't even appear to make the effort to keep them. All we do is
shrug our shoulders.
Scott agrees and adds: ''So far it has all worked out pretty well. I
hope that I can hold my place in the team. The competition down here
will be immense. And . . . no, I don't think I'll be back for a while.''
I shrug my shoulders. I give up.

START the New Year with a new savings account. There are still too
many people not keeping a watchful eye on the interest they are getting
on their savings.
Indeed, according to the latest issue of Which? magazine, around 20
million savers are losing a total of #800m in interest a year mainly
because their money is left languishing in obsolete savings accounts on
which derisory rates are paid.
Among the low-paying defunct accounts from larger institutions listed
by Which? were the Royal Bank of Scotland's Seven-Day Deposit account
and the TSB's Service and Deposit accounts.
A variety of similar building society accounts were also listed. But
even accounts which are still open are not necessarily giving a good
deal either. Among the ''worst buy'' notice accounts currently on offer
is the Bank of Scotland's Premier Accounts.
There is some debate about whether banks or building societies should
automatically transfer savers' money out of obsolete accounts to new
accounts paying higher rates if they have similar conditions. Some banks
and building societies already do this, but many do not.
The Building Societies' Ombudsman argues that building societies
should inform customers of current rates by displaying them prominently
in branches, for example, and if possible by notifying them
individually. But he puts the onus on savers to keep abreast of interest
rates and transfer their money if necessary.
So make a point of visiting your bank or building society in the near
future and checking out the rate you are getting on your savings. The
odd percentage difference may not sound much but it can quickly add up.
Each 1% difference in the annual rate is worth #10 before tax in the
first year on a deposit of #1000 in the first year. So over five years,
you would be #113 worse off leaving #1000 in an account paying 2% rather
than in one paying 4%. And on larger amounts the losses will obviously
be much greater.
If you find that your account has been closed to new savers, compare
what is currently being offered to see if you would get a better rate.
But check that the conditions, such as the withdrawal terms, are the
same or, if not, that you are happy to say give longer notice.
If you have lost interest as a result of not switching earlier and you
think your bank or building society has failed to keep you informed
about savings rates, it is worth complaining and asking for
compensation.
Make a point also of checking what other institutions have to offer
even if your present account is still open. Rather than traipsing round
the High Street or scanning the ads, the easiest way to find out where
you can get the best savings rate is to go to your library and look at
the latest issue of Which? or, for an even more comprehensive listing,
find out if your library has Moneyfacts, a monthly guide to savings
rates.
Check that you have the right account to meet your needs. Generally
the more notice you can give before withdrawing money, the higher the
rate of interest you'll get on your money.
Larger amounts also attract higher rates of interest, but interest
rate tiers differ from one institution to another, so if you are topping
up your account and maybe entering a higher rate bracket, it is also
worth looking around.
Have you taken advantage of TESSAs yet -- the five-year tax-free
savings account offered by banks and building societies. These usually
pay good rates of interest on relatively modest amounts and you can
still withdraw your money if you need to early and pay tax.
If you need instant access to your money, it is worth considering a
postal account. They usually pay higher rates than similar accounts in
the High Street because of the lower cost to the building societies of
operating them. Admittedly you can't walk into a branch and get your
cash immediately but it will come by return of post.
A word of warning, however, if you have an account with the Halifax or
the Leeds Permanent these should not be switched for the time being
because you may qualify for a bonus when the two societies merge.
Of course, when you review your savings, you should not stop at your
bank and building society accounts. Remember to check out things like
National Savings certificates which go on to a much lower interest rate
when they get to the end of their original term.
Inflation-linked certificates continue to be index-linked but miss out
on extra interest unless you switch them into the current issue.
Then there are personal equity plans to consider. Remember you can
switch your investment to a new manager without losing tax advantages.
The latest PEP performance tables published by London-based financial
advisers Chase De Vere will enable you to compare how your present
managers are performing.
No PEPs have done particularly well over the past year because of the
poor state of the stock market. But if you find your manager's
longer-term results are also poor, making a move now could be
worthwhile.

THE merchant bankers have done their sums -- or most of them anyway.
The personal equity plan managers have sharpened their pencils. The
stockbroker ''share shops'' have dug out their client lists and run off
a whole heap of envelopes. The volcano has erupted on to our television
screens.
The machinery has been cranked up for the latest big privatisation
sale, the offer of the remaining Government-owned shares in National
Power and PowerGen.
It is, as Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers points out,
likely to be the last major privatisation sale. That assumes that the
railways will not make their way on to the bargain counter at least in
the immediate future.
As opposed to the simple ''fill in the coupon and send your cheque''
style of the early privatisation offers, this one follows and develops
the more recent method of using ''share shops'' to handle applications.
Following the policy of encouraging the use of share shops in order to
make people more familiar with them and more likely to return to buy
other shares, the Government again says that as well as incentives,
priority in allocations will be available only to those who register in
advance with a share shop. Registration, it points out, does not commit
you to buy shares.
The sale involves shares currently valued at around #4000m in the two
companies. There will be a big marketing effort aimed at international
and institutional investors but at least 40% of the shares are to be
offered to UK retail investors in the UK public offer.
The public offer part of the sale will be at a discount to the price
finally struck for the institutional sale. That discount will be applied
to the first of the three instalments. For your incentive you are likely
to have the choice of a share bonus, probably one for 10 after three
years, or a discount off the second instalment.
As with the first sale, applications in the public offer have to be
for a package in the proportion of three National Power to two PowerGen
although the shares will be traded separately once dealing starts in
partly-paid form. As with previous privatisations only one application
per person is allowed.
The Government has, however, taken note of criticisms that investors
can be left with very small shareholdings if the issue is a popular one.
So it is repeating the idea of a retail tender offer. This is aimed at
the larger investor and in particular those wanting to put their shares
into personal equity plans.
You can, if you want to make a larger investment, apply for this in
addition to an application in the public offer. Using this method you
apply through a retail tender broker who will submit applications in
either or both companies in your behalf. You can put in your bid on a
''strike price only'' basis and will get your shares allocated at the
same price as the institutions.
There are no discounts or incentives with this offer but it does give
you a chance to get a PEPable number of shares and there will in fact be
preference given to applications committed to a PEP.
Minimum investment in the retail tender offer is likely to be around
#3000 for the first instalment as opposed to something between #300 and
#500 in the public offer.
The retail tender offer idea is catching on. It is thought likely that
as many as 100,000 people may apply using this route compared with
40,000 in the BT3 offers which was the last time it was tried. It made
its debut with BT2 but there was a much smaller response then.
PEPs are also expected to be used on an increased scale. Mr Urquhart
Stewart says Barclays Stockbrokers opened 10,000 PEPs with BT3, four or
five times as many as for BT2 and he expects more this time.
The careful timing of the three instalments to ensure that each is
made in a separate tax year is also seen as a help to PEP investments.
This is not a get-rich-quick offer as the price will obviously relate
to the market price of shares already on the market. But if it follows
form full dividends will be paid even when the shares are only partly
paid which improves the yield (tax-free in a PEP). There is also a good
prospect of a steady increase in dividends over the years.
Barclays Stockbrokers estimates that National Power dividends will
rise from 12.5p net for last year to 14.5p and then 17.2p. For PowerGen
the forecast is up from 12.65p to an estimated 15p and 18.2p. Both
companies are financially strong with little or no debt.
Assessment of political and regulatory risk is a matter of individual
judgment but the market does not seem too worried right now with the
companies priced at yields slightly below the market average.
There are 130 share shops but as these include banks and building
societies there are more than 11,000 High Street outlets. For the retail
tender offer there are 110 brokers, most of them also share shops.
ProShare has produced a guide to using a share shop which you can get
for #1.95 by telephoning 0424 755 755.
Among the useful points it makes are to check if your shares will be
registered in your name or the share shop's nominee and ask what fees
are involved if the share shop uses a nominee (not all do). The ProShare
book has a useful section giving names and details of them all.
An impressive release of power . . . The advertising campaign for the
remaining Government-owned shares in National Power and PowerGen has
erupted on to our television screens

THE old adage that to travel hopefully is better than to arrive
certainly does not apply to modern-day travel. ''To arrive without
dreading the return journey'' might be more appropriate. But there are
some ways to make the journey more bearable.
The importance of choosing your seat on the plane has already been
outlined. You should also consider becoming a vegetarian for the
duration of the flight; special dishes for non-meat eaters can be better
than the pre-cooked reheated lumps of meat on some airlines, accompanied
by plastic-packaged sauces of indeterminate origin.
Before you even get on the plane, however, there is the problem of
packing. If your children are young, pack a bag of Mothers' Comforts, as
we used to call them. These included, apart from such obvious
ingredients as nappies, made-up bottles, boiled water, tins of baby food
and can openers, plastic spoons, spare clothes, bribes suitable for the
child/children's age such as sweets, the scabbiest cuddly toys in
current favour, a bottle of gripe water, and a roll of loo paper. For
Mum, a couple of miniature bottles of something nice.
When packing your main luggage, do remember that unless you're going
to the North Pole, Sahara Desert, or some former Iron Curtain countries,
most essentials are available in the resort you're heading for, and
casual clothes bought abroad tend to look better and be more suitable
than those you cram into your bursting suitcase.
Since luggage has been known to get lost, the so called ''hand
baggage'' should contain everything you need for 24 hours' survival
after arrival, including lots of empty plastic carrier bags.
On scheduled flights only, there could be a chance of being upgraded
to business, or even first, class. To maximise this chance, arrive just
a little before advertised check-in time, looking immaculate. No jeans,
no sandals, no shorts (the people checking in looking as if they've just
come from the jumble sale are passengers who've paid to travel up
front). Then, if you have no young children, and you smarm the check-in
clerk, you may just be asked if you'd be prepared to be moved to a
higher class.
Once you've checked in, ignore the first call that your flight is now
ready for boarding; wait until the first time they announce that ''. . .
this is the final call for . . .'' then move to the departure gate,
otherwise you just queue for no purpose.
If anything does go wrong on the holiday, don't wait until you get
home before putting in your complaint. Deal with it on the spot, and
watch how other nationalities do it.
The Americans shout, the French scream, and the Germans rumble, but
not the British -- they harbour their discontent until they get home,
when it is too late to do anything about it.
Ask to see your travel company's rep, and go with him or her to see
the manager, where you should be responsible but firm. Remember that
there is a fair chance that the rep is having a big thing with the
manager, so don't assume that you have an ally.
Make a note of your complaint, even ask one of them to initial it, but
usually you'll find that things can get sorted out.
When tipping on holiday, remember to tip early. There's no point in
tipping, generously or not, as you are about to leave, unless you are
sure you are coming back, and the same staff will be there to look after
you.
Apart from the Scandinavians, who don't tip at all, and the Belgians
who tip meanly, watch the Americans; they'll tip everyone in sight on
the day of their arrival, with an implied promise of more to come.
Whether any more is forthcoming makes little difference to the treatment
you'll get.
Once the time comes to leave, there's the packing for home. This is
quite different from packing at home, especially if you're on a holiday
where you must check out at midday for a midnight departure.
Load as much as you can into your main luggage, but keep everything
for your comfort in hand luggage; the plastic bags you brought are for
the wet bathing cossies and towels you'll be using up to the last
minute. Don't wear your clothes suitable for the Scottish climate until
you are almost ready for landing -- so keep those in your hand luggage
too.
And as for travelling home with children? Repeat items listed above as
Mothers' Comforts. And don't worry -- it'll soon be over!

There is only one way to see this small but beautiful Hebridean island
of Vatersay, decides Bruce Sandison, and that's to take a trek right
around it
I FIRST visited Vatersay by open-deck boat from Castlebay on Barra,
before the building of the present causeway. Prior to its construction,
Calum Macdonald, then MP for the Western Isles, said: ''It would be a
human tragedy if the Vatersay islanders were evacuated like the people
of St Kilda in the 1930s. This should never happen in the 1980s.''
Nor did it, but many have mixed feelings about the long-term effect
this new ease of access will have on the traditional way of life on this
beautiful Hebridean island.
Vatersay is most notorious for the land raid which took place there in
1908. Then it was owned by Lady Cathcart who had inherited the island
from the infamous Colonel Gordon of Cluny, the architect of the
heartless clearances of the late 1800s.
Lady Cathcart had never visited Vatersay, but when 11 Barra men
started farming on the island, she called in the police. The men were
arrested, convicted, and imprisoned in Calton Jail, Edinburgh. Public
opinion was outraged and the men were quickly released. In 1909, the
Scottish Office bought Vatersay from Lady Cathcart and turned the island
over to crofting.
The island is separated from Barra by the Sound of Vatersay,
white-wave-capped, emerald and azure shallows dominated by ragged
Heishival Mor (190m), the highest point on Vatersay. The principal
township is to the south, across a narrow isthmus, at the end of the
only road on the island.
On either side of the isthmus lie two magnificent beaches; soft,
yellow sand, backed by wildflower-rich dunes enclosing crystal-clear,
blue waters, black-bobbed with busy fishing boats.
The island school sits above the north end of the east beach and as I
passed, at lunchtime, the children eagerly investigated my purpose.
Vatersay has been home and haven for man for thousands of years, as is
evidenced by archaeological excavations at Uidh and by the Pictish
Symbol Stone found near the old church at Sumula on the remote island of
Pabbay to the south.
These southern islands, Sandray, Pabbay, Mingulay, and Berneray, are
now uninhabited, abandoned in 1934, but they may still be visited by
boat from Castlebay.
Walking the coastline of Vatersay is a full-day expedition. From
Caolis, hike west to Traigh Varlish, then climb south-east to the summit
of Heishival. The view is outstanding: north to Heaval (383m), towering
over Kiessimul Castle in Castle Bay; south across an island-clad
water-wilderness; and to the east, a distant prospect of Sgurr Alasdair
(3309m) on Skye.
Continue half a mile south-east, then descend to the grey monument
above the golden crescent of Bagh Siar sands. The moor falls to
sea-level by Bagh a'Deas, a lime-rich machair strand, leading north to
the metropolis of Vatersay: a few houses, church, burial ground, shop,
and playing-field. From the township, walk east to the long beach
fringing Vatersay Bay and north over the sand to the schoolhouse.
Find the road at the end of the beach and walk back to Caolis. Along
the way, look out for the wreckage of a Second World War aircraft, bits
of which are still scattered on the hillside by the track before the
right turn to Uidh. Bear left here and skirt Cornaig Bay to end a
glorious, unforgettable Vatersay day.

Three adventurers have ridden to the rescue of our film industry --
but do they know what they have let themselves in for? Sara Villiers
digs into making of Shallow Grave
ONE FOR all and all for one? Well, everyday folks may not brandish
swords and sabres any more, but in some ways these days are more
cut-throat than any The Three Musketeers had to deal with. Solidarity?
Friendship? Loyalty? Nice try but no cigar. Move over Porthos, Athos,
and Aramis. Meet David, Alex, and Juliet, (anti-) heroes of Shallow
Grave.
A modern-day tale of cynical chums, Shallow Grave chronicles the
fluctuating relationships between the aforementioned trio,
twentyyouknowwhats who share a flat in Edinburgh. Plunged into a moral
dilemma when their new flatmate Hugo departs this earth leaving a
suitcase of cash stashed under his bed, the threesome opt for the
criminal option.
Punting a putative Shallow Grave at the Edinburgh Film Festival two
years ago, Glaswegian doctor John Hodge described his story as one of
''love, trust, and friendship'', adding the more fashionable addendums
''sex, violence, evil, greed, anger, betrayal, death, dismemberment, and
disposal''. The latter litany was modish enough to secure interest and
the readies. Producer Andrew Macdonald got #850,000 from Channel 4, with
the Glasgow Film Fund chipping in the necessary #150,000 top-up.
The flag for the Scottish film industry was duly dusted down and
raised and screeds of newsprint and more ''digging'' puns than you could
shake a spade at have since been devoted to the progress of Shallow
Grave, from news stories on its funding structure, to location reports
from the studio set in an Anniesland warehouse, to the amusingly
contradictory reviews which greeted its first screening last August at
the Edinburgh Film Festival.
Critics were divided but the audience cheered and Philip Thomas,
editor of the movie magazine Empire, predicted that Shallow Grave could
pick up the kind of cult following which Reservoir Dogs enjoys. The
script is hardly as tart as Tarantino's but it is a lively, compulsive
thriller which should hit the mark with its young target audience.
Director Danny Boyle whips the plot along with an aplomb which belies
the fact that this is his feature-film debut, while the Edinburgh-based
flat (shot in Anniesland) in which the majority of the action is set is
improbably chic but a sumptuous treat to look at. Torture and terror
abound but even its grandest guignol shouldn't heave up the popcorn;
this is stylised splendour and violence.
New Zealander Kerry Fox rests on her Angel at my Table laurels with a
rather lacklustre performance as Dr Juliet, Ewan McGregor (Scarlet and
Black, Lipstick on your Collar) proves he's more than teen heart-throb
fodder, investing the sarky Alex -- why, oh why, are hacks always
portrayed as conniving, drunken smartasses? -- with a good dose of
likeable humour, while Christopher Eccleston (Let Him Have It, Cracker)
brings muscle in more ways than one to the more complex character of
David, the accountant.
Boyle frightens an audience out of their socks, never mind their
seats, with a few brilliant shock shots but the flatmates' descent into
mistrust and betrayal is hardly surprising. Any trio which fuels its
secret pact with a few glasses of vino rather than the obligatory filmic
motif of a blood-brother bond of pricked thumbs is bound to come
unstuck, and deservedly so, with much weeping, teeth-gnashing,
hair-pulling, and chaps crucified to the kitchen floor.
One for all and all for one: except for younger brothers.
The search for finance for Shallow Grave was originally filmed as a
10-minute video diary for Edinburgh Nights by Andrew Macdonald and his
younger brother Kevin. The plan was for a co-production but while Andrew
had built up credentials working at the National Film School and on
Revolution, Venus Peter, The Big Man, The Advocates, and Taggart, it
soon became obvious that the prospect of the relatively inexperienced
Kevin directing a million-pound film was a no-no.
Andrew dumped him for Boyle, who had theatrical kudos from the Royal
Court and the RSC, and more crucially, televisual acclaim with Mr Rose's
Virgins and episodes of Inspector Morse. Perhaps this move was a homage
to the filmic motif whereby the younger brother is always left behind --
and then has to sneak after his sibling, watching the ensuing exploits
from behind the bushes.
Which is just what Kevin did. He promptly secured a commission from
BBC Scotland's Ex-S strand to film a documentary on the making of the
film. ''Instead of suing the hell out of him,'' Kevin snarls, but not
very convincingly, ''I decided to exact my revenge by filming Andrew
producing his first feature film. To catch him in the act of digging his
own grave.''
Kevin insists that his film is not pure PR whitewash and certainly it
entertainingly captures some embarrassing moments -- most notably when
Andrew blanches on camera at the discovery that 18 rolls instead of 18
boxes of 400ft film had been budgeted for, causing A Serious Financial
Problem -- but there is obviously no emnity between the brothers, and
its forthcoming broadcast is a masterly piece of hype.
''Of course there is no bad feeling over Kevin not directing the
film,'' grins Andrew. ''He knew ages ago that it wasn't a serious
consideration.'' Happy to condone an irreverent record of the
film-making, Andrew allowed behind-the-scenes filming but now grimaces
over the finished result. ''I hate it,'' he says. ''It's obviously
tongue-in-cheek but I can't watch it.'' No doubt this is because he
features most prominently in the documentary, unable, like the others,
to shoo his brother away.
Kevin is no Paxman, nor Nic Broomfield. Pestering Kerry Fox to
describe her character she simply mutters: ''I don't really know, she's
mysterious,'' and appears more preoccupied with fussing over how to wear
her hair in a ceilidh scene. However, Kevin niggles away at his brother
throughout the six-week shoot, tracing his evolution from initial
exuberance to exhaustion. By the third week Andrew looks dangerously
thin, eliciting concerned remarks from all around him.
''I'm feeling fine. I'm in very good health,'' he wearily tells a
colleague. Kevin gleefully exploits the situation -- ''You look tired,''
he badgers. ''No, I'm all right,'' Andrew insists, attempting a strained
smile. The camera zooms in on his sunken eyes and taut cheekbones. Kevin
gets his kill. Andrew snaps: ''That's enough of this. I just can't be
bothered.''
High points of the documentary are Chris Eccleston musing ''I've got a
sore throat'' -- you'll have to see the film to get the joke -- and
Scotland On Sunday's arts editor, Richard Mowe, leaving the press
screening at Cannes, telling Kevin: ''It's dire. It's awful. I've never
seen such a load of old garbage.'' Even more entertaining was Mowe's
recent description of his comment as ''a mischievous anecdote to the
luvvy atmosphere of its hothouse Cannes baptism''.
None the less it does seem surprising that the Beeb thought the making
of Shallow Grave merited a documentary, especially considering Ex-S has
already shown a film-of-the-film, on The Priest and The Pirates, in this
series. The perils and pitfalls of both are interesting stuff but get a
grip, we're not talking Apocalypse Now.
But full marks to Kevin for pre-empting this cavil by comparing his
documentary with Theresa Coppola's Hearts Of Darkness. With a tongue so
firmly in cheek it's surprising he doesn't drill a hole right through
his face, he says: ''I wanted to make something similar about Shallow
Grave, except in Glasgow, without the jungle and the helicopters,'' Now,
that's what I call mischievous anecdote.
One for all and all for one: Perhaps Quentin Tarantino has had a lot
to do with it, but suddenly the movie mags are concentrating less on
stars and more on the movers and shakers. The publicity for Shallow
Grave has not featured the trio of Eccleston, Fox, and McGregor but that
of MacDonald, Hodge, and Boyle.
It was they who took the bow at the charity premiere of the film in
Glasgow last month, chumming around at the party afterwards; three
thirtyyouknowwhats in casual but cool attire, Boyle with his quirky
quiff, Hodge in skinhead and permanently startled expression, and the
assured, smiling Macdonald.
He's got a lot to smile about. The trio are the new kids on the block
and everyone wants them to come out to play. They are quick to play up
their matey image, insisting they intend to work together on future
projects.
It's not so much hot air. The film may be a blood-red spectacle but
before opening Shallow Grave is already in the black and has paid back
the Glasgow Film Fund's investment, having secured an early $2million
deal with Polygram, which is distributing the film in seven countries,
including the US. It has already attracted interest in Hollywood and
Macdonald has received blind offers for their next project and had
discussions with producers like Scott Rudin from Paramount (The Firm and
The Addams Family), Richard Zanuck (Jaws, The Sting), and Mark Johnson
(Diner, Rain Man).
Recognising that they're now at what could be the most pressurised
point of their career, and trying not to be too weighed down by the
burden of the future of the Scottish, and indeed British, film industry
on their shoulders, they plan to up the ante and make a $10m
transatlantic movie, with location scenes shot in America and studio
work in the UK.
Hodge has written a script draft for the ''romantic comedy thriller'',
A Life Less Ordinary, and Macdonald hopes to secure box-office names
like Johnny Depp and Patricia Arquette for the leads -- but they're
certainly not buying into Hollywood wholesale. ''It's a romance but one
with a twist, more Blue Velvet than Four Weddings and a Funeral,
explains Macdonald. ''With heads in swimming-pools.''
Watery Graves? Sounds as if the gruesome array of hacksaws assembled
for Shallow Grave might just come in handy. Macdonald tightens his lips.
They want to play the project close to their chests before pitching it
at Robert Redford's Sundance festival for independents, in Utah, at the
end of January.
What Macdonald is insistent about is that the deal comes as a package;
the script, Macdonald, Hodge, and Boyle. Macdonald has been influenced
by the work of his grandfather Emeric Pressburger, screenwriter and
long-time collaborator with Michael Hill, and is a great believer in
ensemble work.
''I'm very committed to that. It was the way my grandfather worked and
the way people like Billy Wilder or Hitchcock worked. We want to work on
contemporaneous issues with people of our own age -- exactly the way
Woody Allen works.''
But surely, as Shallow Grave so vividly demonstrates, a three-way
alliance can become very fraught? As John Hodge muses: ''Triumvirates do
form unspoken alliances, with the power shifting back and forth to
whoever has money, influence, or even a sense of humour at any
particular moment.''
''Well, yes it can be, it could all go wrong, we could end up like Mia
and Woody . . . '' Macdonald's voice trails off nervously but then
concludes on a resolutely upbeat note: '' . . . but that's all part of
it and you can have very productive times and periods when it can work,
and work very well.''
Sure. One for all and all for one and all that. But, a word in your
shellike, boys. A spot of thumb-pricking wouldn't go amiss.
* Digging Your Own Grave, BBC1, January 17. Shallow Grave is now on
general release.

The joyful song of this thrush carries a long way in the bleak winter
months. But don't let it fool you. This is a bold bird with murderous
habits, warns Hugh Ouston
ON New Year's Day 1900, Thomas Hardy was listening to a mistle thrush
before he penned the words: ''And all at once a voice arose/among the
bleak twigs overhead/in a full-hearted evensong/of joy illimited?''
From the start of the year you can hear its far-carrying song, usually
from the top of a high tree, further away than you think. And it sings
in the teeth of January gales and rain -- and at evening when poets go
out for walks -- which makes it so conspicuous in midwinter and gives it
one of its best-known alternative names -- storm cock.
It's a big, bold bird, paler and more heavily spotted than the song
thrush, and if you see it closely enough the spots on its upper chest
are fan-shaped. The birds you see now may well have come down to lowland
Scotland from the higher ground and some come over for the winter from
northern Europe.
A bold bird indeed: during the winter individuals or a pair will
defend a berry bush such as a big garden holly, driving other thrushes
away to be sure of a winter-long larder. Mistletoe berries are another
favourite. The eighteenth-century naturalist Thomas Bewick thought that
they could only germinate if they passed through the bird's digestive
system. This is what gives it its Christmassy common name.
In East Lothian it is prosaically called the ''Big Mavis''; in Buchan,
more romantically, the ''Hillan Piet''. You will hear a football rattle
noise and see the flash of white underwing as it flies across park or
field; the song thrush's armpit is brown and those of the winter
visitors, redwing and fieldfare, red and grey respectively. A bold bird
indeed and an aggressive one, for it eats not just seeds but insects,
worms, and occasionally the nestlings of other birds -- a gruesome
surprise but how well-suited to the bird that sang in the twentieth
century.

The Scilly Isles are famed for their daffodils, beaches, and the
facilities offered to divers by the many wrecks around their shores.
Allan Rogers savours all these attractions and more
THE figurehead of the lady in the green dress fascinated me. She was
like a ghost from the past and it was hard not to think of the men who
had followed her to their deaths. She was as trim and fresh as when she
and her ship had sunk nigh on 200 years ago. I came face to face with
her at ''Valhalla'' in the Abbey Garden at Tresco in the Isles of
Scilly.
Beyond the buffers where the train stops at Penzance I headed for the
sea and after making my way past the sellers of crabs, mussels, and
prawns I boarded the Scillonion III, the daily ferry to the Isles of
Scilly. When we were out to sea I bought a Cornish pastie and went up on
deck to enjoy both it and the view. Above the squawking of the seagulls,
a commentary from the bridge pinpointed harbours and lighthouses as they
slipped by. It added a bit of local colour to the trip. The voice
belonged to the First Officer, who was firmly of the opinion that you're
not a true visitor to the Scillies unless you go by sea. He was
justifiably proud of his ''lovely little run'' along the Cornish
coastline. ''And now,'' he said, ''we're getting out into the Atlantic
where the English Channel and the Bristol Channel cross so we're
starting to get a little bit of a tumble in the water.''
The ''tumble'' in the water was a classic bit of English
understatement and as we heaved through turbulent lumps of sea that
Cornish pastie was having a bit of of a tumble in my tummy. The ''local
colour'' was getting decidedly green but the pastie was still with me
when we sailed into quieter waters in the centre of the Scilly Isles.
We tied up at Hugh Town on St Mary's and I came ashore to a place with
its character pleasantly preserved and took my bearings by the shops and
pubs. All had nautical names above their doors. There was The Cornish
Trader, The Sandpiper, The Mermaid, The Atlantic Hotel, and The Bishop
and Wolf -- a pub named after the famous lighthouses. A board outside
promised ''good pub grub'' and priced the home-made cottage pie at
#3.95.
The main attraction of the place lies in exploring the ''off islands''
and their fine beaches. You can reach them by taking the little launches
that each day ferry visitors from the harbour, but first, I wanted to
get to grips with St Mary's, so I took the guided tour round the island
on the little red bus.
Vic's Tour stops frequently to show you the sights; it has to, with
only 11 miles of gently winding lanes you'd soon be back where you
started from if it didn't.
Driver Bruce Maple's commentary has more than a touch of humour to it:
''In the winter we do the flowers, in the summer we do the tourists.''
Years ago the flowers came to the islands through a shipwreck. The
islanders salvaged a cargo of ''onions'' which turned out to be
inedible, so they threw them away. They weren't onions and the next
year, up came the flowers. It became a major business almost by accident
thanks to William Trevelyan, who was out walking at Rocky Hill Farm and
found a host of wild daffodils. He put them in a hatbox and sent them
off to Covent Garden in London. They sent back a load of money because
they were early and out of season. Soon everyone was running around with
hatboxes.
The islanders are now busy with the flowers through September to
March. They might look pretty to the tourist but it can be hard work, as
Bruce Maple puts it: ''I'd like to have a word with that fellow William
Wordsworth about his poetry. Down with your head between your knees and
your bum stuck up in the air's not so lovely!'' What makes it all
possible is the Gulf Stream and the pleasant mild climate. Flowers seem
to be popping up everywhere, even between the rocky walls of the narrow
lanes in the town.
The Scillies attract people who like the quiet beaches and a
particularly fine strand on St Martin's is listed as one of the top ten
beaches in the world. Most of the islands, only five of which are
inhabited, have about seven or eight beaches and the longest it would
take you to walk from one beach to another would be about 20 minutes.
Bird-watchers flock to the Scillies to catch a glimpse of rare birds
blown off course during their migration and the islands are also very
popular with artists. It's a good place to learn if there's a Van Gogh
in you busting to get out. If you fancy dabbling in watercolours there
are organised holiday courses, or you can fix up half a day's
instruction when you arrive.
It's easy to find Joe Browning's little gallery and studio. It's just
off the ''Thoroughfare'' in St Mary's overlooking the bay. Boats bob at
anchor outside providing a ready-made subject to paint. From amid the
paints he pulled out two glasses and as he poured us sherry, as he
enthused about his lot. ''I teach the local kiddies on Saturday
mornings, it's hard work but it keeps them out of mischief. During the
week I deal with holidaymakers in the summer and locals in the winter .
. . for #10 I give a whole morning's tuition, that includes all the
materials for the whole afternoon as well. I guarantee people can learn
something. If they don't, they can have their money back. I teach them
how to do watercolour and then finish off by painting a landscape
straight out of the window here.''
I looked out the window and wished that I had a morning or six to
spare. I really wanted to stay and paint boats.
On a blackboard in Main Street there's a list of the day's boat trips.
You can choose from Tresco, St Agnes, Samson, Bryher, and St Martins.
There are others that will take you to see the Bishop Rock Lighthouse
plus seals and birds along the way.
I joined the holiday population in the morning drift down to the
harbour for the migration to the islands, found a sheltered spot behind
the wheelhouse on Ben Babcock's boat, and settled down to enjoy a trip
to Tresco. We hadn't travelled far before I was pushed gently but firmly
from my seat by a large friendly dog called Skipper. Ben might have been
steering the boat but Skipper left you in no doubt as to who was in
charge.
Two passengers in green cagoules tightened the drawstring on their
hoods and for a moment looked not unlike a pair of Ninja Turtles. The
boat was full and other small craft were heading to the different
islands. There are about 140 islands and a considerable number of rocks,
so it's comforting to note that each boatman has to pass five tests set
by the Council of the Isles of Scilly.
The storm clouds had passed over and the sun was shining when we
landed at Tresco. A pair of children from a neighbouring island wearing
bright orange lifejackets clambered from their boat and ran to a waiting
tractor. They certainly had a colourful way of commuting to school.
Back in 1834 Augustus Smith started the first compulsory education in
Britain on the Scillies. A penny a week was charged to go to school,
twopence a week if you didn't go! All the boys learned navigation and
most did well. Ships coming down from Liverpool would recruit them and
they earned their living as crew and sometimes as captains of
ocean-going vessels. Many brought back plants to the Abbey Garden at
Tresco.
The garden is a magnificent affair, containing about 28,000 varieties
of plant spread over 17 acres. The four south-facing terraces give
separate mini ecological zones. At the top it's hot and dry in the
summer and down at the bottom it's moist and damp.
Ron Geadle gave up a career in medicine to become one of the six
gardeners and we followed him along terraces crowded with plants from
the Canaries and Australia, passing Bird of Paradise flowers with bright
beaks, like Triffids waiting to strike. We looked up at eucalyptus trees
with fragrant bark and sniffed lemon-scented geraniums. Down from the
Neptune steps and under the giant tree ferns we went, until we reached
Valhalla, an open-sided building that houses a collection of ships'
figureheads.
They have been lovingly restored and maintained by the National
Maritime Museum. Many more must still lie beneath the sea. In the past
200 years there have been 600 recorded wrecks and when underwater
archaeology groups go down they came across wreck upon wreck three or
four deep around some of the lodges where ships have foundered. The
figure of 600 must be a gross underestimate of what has really happened,
many ships having gone down without being registered at Lloyd's.
From the ramparts of the 400-year-old Star Castle Hotel in St Mary's,
where I was staying, I could see the light on the Bishop Rock Lighthouse
seven miles away. Coming from New York it's the first warning of land
you get after 3000 miles at sea. At 170ft high it's the tallest offshore
light in the world. Completed back in 1856, it took eight years to
build. There is no doubt that it was sorely needed. The area is a
massive graveyard of ships, many of them dating from the seventeenth
century.
If you want a relic from a wreck, follow the road behind the town's
main beach until you come to a shop with a full-size ship's figurehead
above its door. It's one of the places where finds from the old wrecks
are offered for sale. Much of it is in silver coins, doubloons, and
dollars from HMS Association, a ship which was once instrumental in
capturing #3m in gold and silver from a Spanish fleet. It sank in 1707
along with four major ships of the British fleet when they were
returning from a blockade of Toulon. More than 1800 men drowned in what
was reckoned to be the worst naval disaster in British history.
It is not only ships that make an unexpected landfall on the Scillies.
Winged creatures do it too. Unlikely birds turn up and their arrival
brings extra business to the hotels and guest-houses. The main season
for ordinary holidaymakers is from March to September, people from all
walks of life, but in October you get the rare breed, the bird-watcher.
They are known as ''tickers'' and ''twitchers'' because, I'm told, when
they hear there's a bird round the corner that they haven't yet seen
they start twitching -- and then when they see it they tick it off in
their books. A boatman recalled their enthusiasm and dedication: ''They
were almost like lemmings on the end of the pier, we'd got 900
bird-watchers over to Tresco by nine one morning.''
If you're keen on making the most of the flora and fauna, it's worth
visiting the Church Hall on St Mary's for an evening slide show on the
wildlife. It's given by Will Wagstaff of Island Wildlife tours. There is
something happening in St Mary's every night -- lectures on diving and
marine life, Scilly through the ages, Elizabethan music, and on
alternate weeks you can see a play or a variety show.
One very popular outdoor entertainment is gig racing. The gigs were
pilot cutters -- the first man to reach a ship needing a pilot would get
the job, so they used to race each other. Over the years the boats
almost disappeared (only four remained), then somebody had the bright
idea of starting inter-island gig racing. It became a fast-growing sport
and now they have them all over Cornwall. Each Friday evening during the
season you can follow the racing. They're best seen from on board the
launches that travel alongside.
The marine slide show tempted me to look into the wonders of the deep.
I joined Mark Groves of Island Underwater Safaris for a three-hour
diving experience. We waddled into the sea and stuck our heads below the
surface. I was completely decked out in a frogman's outfit, with lead
weights and a cumbersome air tank that threatened to invert me. After
some rapid and panicky breathing, things calmed down and I was able to
turn my attention from survival to looking at the wonders of the deep
and shaking hands with a few crabs.
Around the islands the waters are clear and you can see a tremendous
variety of marine plants and animals. It was quite a change from
snorkelling, in that with the tanks you didn't have to keep coming up
for air. If you found something that interested you, you could stay and
look at it. I began to understand how people became hooked on diving and
why, with all the wrecks around, the Scillies were so popular.
The other memory was the return trip back to the mainland. We flew on
an eight-seater Britten Norman Islander. The flight to Land's End
aerodrome at St Just took only 15 minutes, but it gave us a brief last
look at the scattering of islands that we had enjoyed and a dramatic
view of the waves crashing round the Longships Lighthouse. When we came
down to land on the grassy airstrip at Land's End I really wanted to
head for the boat and start all over again.

Scottish Television personality Kirsty Young tells Alison Kerr her
favourite films
SCOTTISH Television's star newsreader Kirsty Young has been gracing
our screens on Mondays and Fridays with her prime-time discussion show,
Kirsty. More used to putting someone else in the hot seat, she claims to
have found the favourite-films question one of the toughest of her
career. So she gave us her shortlist:
''Husbands and Wives and Hannah and Her Sisters (both directed and
written by Woody Allen). I loved Husbands and Wives because I thought it
was so truthful and accurate. It showed all the grey areas in marriage;
all the difficulties people go through because relationships are hard
work. I loved the searing humour in it, and I really liked how it was
filmed with the wobbly hand-held camera. Hannah and Her Sisters was also
great fun, and had some brilliant lines -- Woody's Jewish mother
ordering his father to 'tell him why there's a god', and his reply: 'I
don't even know how the can-opener works'!
''Anything by Mike Leigh -- Naked, Life is Sweet, High Hopes, etc. The
only film I've been to see recently was a special screening of Naked at
East Kilbride. I'd already seen it, but I went again because Mike Leigh
was giving a talk afterwards.
''Glengary Glen Ross I love too, principally because of the David
Mamet script and the performances by Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. Pacino
used to be a big favourite of mine. Which explains the next choice.
''The Godfather trilogy. I'm afraid I can't help but be seduced by it,
by those images. Although having seen Scorsese's Goodfellas, I have to
say I preferred it.''
Kirsty added: ''The movie playing at my Fantasy Filmhouse would star
(in order of billing): Alison Steadman; Michelle Pfeiffer; Jeff Bridges
(I'd watch him paint a wall); Jack Nicholson; John Malkovich; David
Thewlis, and Al Pacino (at the bottom because he's on his way out from
being a favourite).
''Martin Scorsese would direct and I'd have Woody Allen and David
Mamet as writers. It would be a black comedy set in New York, with a
strong, funny plot, some romance (maybe between Michelle and David
Thewlis?) and a happy ending, but definitely not a sickly sweet one like
Sleepless in Seattle's.''

Tourists often blow hot and cold over Scandinavia because of the high
cost of living there. But, says Doreen Taylor-Wilkie, with a little
careful planning most costs can be cut
HOW often do you hear someone say: ''I'd love to go to Sweden . . . or
Norway . . . or Denmark, but Scandinavia is just so expensive!'' Yes, in
some ways, so it is, but that reputation is often exaggerated. In any
case, there are a lot of tips for cutting the costs which all the old
hands use.
Tourism in Sweden had a big boost when the country devalued at the
same time as Britain, and a further fall in the krona means that British
visitors now get nearly 30% more Swedish currency for their pound, at
something like 13 kronor to the pound sterling. Coupled with recent
reduction in MOMS (VAT) on tourist services, particularly hotels, from
21% to 12%, it has given a noticeable help with costs.
Though Denmark and Norway did not follow suit in devaluing, the
tourist industries of all three countries are making valiant efforts,
not just to keep costs down, but to cut them. Travelling all over
Scandinavia last summer, the price-paring was noticeable.
To tackle the most conspicuous price first: alcohol is undoubtedly
dear, particularly in restaurants and hotels. In proportion, this
applies especially to wine, which many restaurants mark up rigorously to
try to help the cost of spirits, even if only minimally. That is why you
may see a Norwegian party, say, sitting in one of the restaurants
overlooking Bergen's beautiful harbour and drinking spirits with a meal.
It may be pricier but it is better value.
The reasons for these costs are historical, dating back to a time of
strong teetotal lobbies -- Norway even had a spell of prohibition which
merely had the usual effect. Influenced by this drive to cut drinking,
Scandinavian governments put heavy taxes on alcohol and the Swedes and
Norwegians decreed that the state would buy and sell alcohol as a
monopoly.
This does not mean that hotels and licensed restaurants do not provide
alcohol, but for direct buying, Sweden has Systembolaget's alcohol
shops, and Norway's are Vinmonopolet. It may feel a bit like buying your
drink in a chemist's but Systembolaget has wine from around 30 Skr a
bottle (less than #3) and Norway's wine is around #5 a bottle upwards.
The Danes have a freer attitude, and prices are nowadays not that much
above many British hotels. As well, Danes are copious beer drinkers and
are one of the few nations I have seen drinking beer for breakfast!
The best advice is to take in the full alcohol allowance for everyone
travelling, and make pre-dinner drinks a room party.
In a curious way, Scandinavian meals come in the wrong order for
British stomachs, as most of the bargains come early in the day. Hotel
breakfasts, almost always included in the room rate, are splendid, a
slightly smaller version of the famous Cold Table, starting with
herring, eggs, cheeses, cold meats, cereals, yoghurts, sour milk, bread,
rolls, and fully cooked breakfast-style dishes such as sausages, bacon,
and so on.
At lunchtime, look for the notices dagens ratt (in Swedish, slight
variations in the other languages) which means dish of the day. This is
an ample one-course meal, with which you also choose a salad to start,
and follow it with coffee at an all-in cost. The price is rarely much
over #5. In many cafes, a single cup of coffee may at first seem pricey.
But it is usually possible to refill your cup without additional cost,
or for a small extra charge.
In the evenings, top, and even medium-range a la carte hotel and
restaurant meals are undoubtedly pricey. It is much cheaper to eat at a
pizzeria, Chinese or Indian style, or at one of the usual burger bars.
Later in the evening, the best place for a quick snack is one of the
streetside sausage vans (polsevagn in Denmark, which claims to make the
best sausages though all three countries have tasty specimens). These
vans and similar kiosks often also sell grilled chicken and hamburgers,
the best anywhere. Sometimes, you can even find chips!
Almost without exception, Scandinavian hotels are comfortable, with
high standards and good service, but their full rates are never cheap.
The trick is to realise when full rates do not apply, for hotels are
very much directed at business clients. When the great Scandinavian
holiday weeks -- late June to early August -- send Swedes, Norwegians,
and Danes dashing for their summer houses, to swim, fish, sail, walk, or
just laze, city hotels may reduce their prices by as much as half.
Special weekend package rates also offer good bargains.
Various Scandinavian hotel chains also offer discount cards and bonus
passes which cut costs and, from May to the end of September, Norway has
a Fiord Pass, costing around #5, which guarantees reduced rates at some
300 hotels around the country. The Scandinavian Bonus (cost around #14)
has a list of 180 hotels throughout the area at good rates from April to
October.
Self-catering is excellent, often in private summer houses when a
family is not using it. Norway, in particular, has a fine range of small
wooden houses -- hytte -- for weekly rents, designed for people who want
to get to know a smaller area well, rather than spend their time
driving. The Lofoten Islands, off the northern coast, have cabins,
called rorbu, once used by fishermen from other parts of the west coast
who came north for winter cod.
Youth hostels are also good, varying from manor houses to city-centre
and purpose-built modern hostels. They cater for every age, with two and
four-bedded rooms, also family rooms, and self-catering facilities. Many
also serve meals and snacks. In comfort, they equal a modest guest-house
or bed and breakfast accommodation. Members of other countries' hostel
associations qualify for cheaper rates. Campsites, whether simple or
luxurious, are excellent, usually rated by a ''star'' or similar system.
Farmhouse holidays are good value and Denmark, particularly Jutland,
makes a speciality of them. Guests live en famille, can take a hand with
the farm work, and Sunday dinner with the host and hostess sitting side
by side at the head of the table is a bit of real Denmark. Again the
standards are high, and I once visited a farm that had used its profits
to provide an indoor swimming-pool for family and guests. Denmark's inns
(kros) are also good value, and offer a system of Kro-Checks, bought in
advance, which allow you to roam at will and book from one kro to the
next.
All three capitals, and many other main cities, run a special discount
card scheme -- such as the Stockholmkortet -- lasting from one to three
days, and on sale at tourist offices. It gives major savings on public
transport, over a wide area around a city, free entry to most museums
and for one or two sight-seeing tours, and big reductions on others,
plus parking privileges.
Scandinavia is a vast area, reaching away up and beyond the Arctic
Circle in Sweden and Norway and southern Denmark touching North Germany.
Motoring, however, is not necessarily the cheapest way to go. Unlike
Britain, Scandinavia never made the mistake of running down its public
transport services, and has very good rail networks and long-distance
buses, which can be more economical than a car. Where the railway stops,
local buses take over, making it relatively simple to reach the smallest
villages.
There are good discount offers such as the Scandinavian Scan Rail Pass
which is valid for unlimited travel during any five days within 15 days.
It also gives discounts on certain ferry and bus routes. Unless you are
a backpacker travelling on foot, Scandinavia will never be cheap. But
one of these Scan Rail Passes, plus a Scandinavian Bonuspass for
accommodation, could make a journey in these countries where nature has
not yet lost out to people, an affordable, as well as an enjoyable
prospect.

The prospects of an end to strife in neighbouring countries have
heralded a marked increase in tourism for Zimbabwe, finds Kirsty Scott
TOURIST industry officials in Zimbabwe say the country increased
earnings from tourism by 20% in 1994, due in part to neighbouring South
Africa's transition to democracy. More than one million holidaymakers, a
record number, visited Zimbabwe in 1994, most of them from South Africa,
followed by Europe, the United States, and Japan, the Zimbabwe Hotel and
Restaurant Association said. Peaceful elections in neighboring
Mozambique and prospects for the end of 19 years of civil war in Angola
also helped to increase tourism, the association said.
The group, which represents most of the nation's hotels, said it
expected tourism earnings of $100 million, compared to $83 million in
1993.
Zimbabwe has several famous attractions, particularly Victoria Falls
and Lake Kariba in the north. Formerly white-ruled Rhodesia, the country
has been relatively stable since becoming black-ruled Zimbabwe in 1980.
* IN AN effort to boost its flagging tourist industry, Taiwan is to
extend the period that foreigners from 12 chosen countries can stay
without visas from five days to 14.
''Some relevant offices are still preparing final documents and we
hope the new regulation can go into effect in January,'' said the
official in the Foreign Ministry's visa section. The 12 countries are
Britain, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.
Facing a decline in foreign tourism, Taiwan eased rules in January
last year to allow citizens from the 12 countries to visit the island
without applying for visas. The number of foreign tourists rose 16% to
1.41 million in the first eight months of 1994 from the same period last
year and tourism bureau officials have attributed the rise to the easing
of visa requirements. The number fell to 1.85 million in 1993 from 1.87
million a year earlier.
Taiwan has strict visa regulations remaining from its martial-law
period, which ended in 1987. Most foreigners must apply for visas before
coming to the island, although some can obtain transit visas at Taipei's
international airport.
* MEANWHILE, Lebanon has sent a team of security experts to Washington
to try to have a nine-year-old US travel ban on the country lifted.
Officials say the mission, to be headed by Beirut's ambassador to
Washington, Riad Tabbara, is seeking to assure US officials that
security measures at Beirut airport and Lebanon in general are
sufficient for American citizens and aircraft to return in safety.
Washington imposed the travel ban in 1985, at the height of Lebanon's
1975-90 civil war, after Muslim guerrillas hijacked a Trans World
Airways airliner to Beirut, killed a US citizen on board, and held its
passengers hostage.
The Beirut Government hopes to be able to persuade Washington to lift
the ban to pave the way for the return of American business and to allow
US contractors to take part in Lebanon's multi-billion-dollar
reconstruction programme, which includes a number of tourism projects.
Under the ban, which prevents US citizens and planes travelling to
Beirut, Lebanon's national carrier, Middle East Airlines, is also barred
from flying to and from the United States and selling tickets there.
* THIS is the year of the short-break holiday. More and more holiday
destinations and individual tourist operators are realising that Britons
are taking their main holiday overseas but will manage to fit in one or
two short breaks during the year. The industry is also taking a closer
look at what it has to offer to children.
Some of the children-friendly mini-holidays on offer around the UK in
the coming months include a trip to Nottinghamshire to relive the story
of Robin Hood at The Tales of Robin Hood in Nottingham, The World of
Robin Hood near Retford, or the popular Sherwood Forest Visitors' Centre
at Edwinstowe.
Several hotels in the region are offering Robin Hood rates with
special deals for children, and many let children stay free if they
share their parents' room. The Holiday Inn Garden Court Hotel, Castle
Marina Park, Nottingham, has large family rooms available. Children aged
less than 11 years eat free from the table d'hote menu and each adult
booking means one free child's breakfast. Robin Hood rate is #29.50 per
person bed and breakfast. Brochure/bookings 0602 500600.
The Evesham Hotel, Cooper's Lane, Off Waterside, in Evesham, is one of
the few country hotels to have won awards for food, accommodation, and
the treatment of children. From the moment youngsters receive the
hotel's cartoon brochure, they know they are in for a treat. For
instance, the somewhat unorthodox swimming-pool lifeguard is a
full-sized stuffed gorilla. Accommodation is set at #55 per person
half-board, while children pay #3 for each year of their life.
Newcastle-upon-Tyne has the North of England's first art gallery
designed specially for children. This is at the Laing Art Gallery and
contains a ''soft'' play area, jigsaw puzzles, distorting mirrors, and
picture games.
In Whitby, on the Yorkshire coast, the owners of Prospect Villa Hotel
go out of their way to provide a home away from home, caring for the
needs of families and adult groups. It is a Victorian townhouse with
good access to the sea and moors and offers four-course evening meals.
Midweek three-day break costs #57.95 per person half-board, with
children at 60% of the adult rate. Brochure and bookings: 0947 603118.
* FOR those tempted to try their hand at the increasingly popular
pastime of horse riding, Dartmoor National Park, often thought of as
England's final remaining wilderness area, offers a range of facilities
and accommodation to suit all ages and levels of experience.
At the village of Lydford, Lydford House country house hotel offers
good standards of hospitality combined with the facility of its own
riding stables within its grounds. Private lessons in the outdoor school
are with qualified instructors, helping riders to brush up on
fundamental skills before venturing out for exhilarating rides on
Dartmoor. Short breaks cost less than #100, including two nights'
accommodation (with free upgrade to four-poster room if available),
three-course dinners and full English breakfast, plus the riding, and
they are available until May 1995.

They're wonderful creatures and may even help to save their world, but
it'll be through sheer charm and not because of any mystic hippie hopes,
warns Anvar Khan
I DIDN'T swim with any dolphins. The much acclaimed ''dolphin
experience'' is for hippies. Dolphins are large, powerful creatures, the
sea a chemical soup, these are the facts. Looking to dolphins for
spiritual medicine is sad and backward. There's no proof that they can
help. But still they enjoy a great press. Thousands testify to their
healing power. So this member of the media corps decided to find out
why.
Man is still enjoying a long-term relationship with dolphins. He
actively seeks them out; they appear when they feel like it. He does all
the work; they make an entrance. Dolphins have a huge sense of
themselves. Hollywood egos. No wonder. In ancient Greece, around 2000
BC, they were revered as gods and there was a death penalty for killing
one.
This, in essence, is the problem. Dolphins are stars and they know it.
They have the same look as the butler in a whodunnit murder mystery, as
if they are quite happy to know something you don't. Dolphins are
painfully intelligent. The dolphin stare is heady, and fans believe its
intensity expresses a deeper wisdom, but it's just method-acting.
Dolphins are fantastic showmen, they are impressive mimics. When a
dolphin looks right at you, it is his blatant curiousity which burns a
hole; the look in the eye is rudely primeval.
But hippies and pilgrims insist that dolphins are the new demi-gods,
an antidote to the modern others; materialism, technology, insularity.
Frustrated Westerners are rebelling against their own, civilised culture
and rooting about allegedly primitive tribes instead. In Aboriginal
culture, dolphins are said to exist to help humans in their evolution.
Dolphins are not reluctant heroes. They shoulder the responsibility of
being superior with a quiet dignity. They bear up well to the job of
carer. It's only part-time after all. But God help the whole species if
they ever haplessly maim anyone. Idols can fall, especially when they're
set up so high.
There was no-one in when the Orca I, driven by Bill Fraser, the head
of Dolphin Ecosse, drove a motley crew of tourists and myself out on to
the pendulous waters of the Moray Firth. Without taking on the issue of
their supposed telepathic powers, dolphins surface when you've lost all
hope of seeing them. A bit like waiting for a bus. It's plain sadistic.
Dolphin lovers explain this behaviour away by aligning it with the force
of good. Apparently dolphin tardiness is their way of showing us that
grasping doesn't get you what you want. I played it safe. I pretended
that I didn't need to see them. But I wanted to, and I did.
They can play. All dolphins do is play. They swarmed towards the boat
from all sides of a grey, Scottish sea. It was teeming with them. People
swung from one side of the deck to the other. Cameras flashing, videos
on autostart, cheering and whooping. The dolphins were outriders; we,
the presidential campaign. You don't need a circus when there's so much
personality in the wild.
We'd paid our money, a tenner a ride, and we wanted a show. The
dolphins performed; noblesse oblige. They swam like bullets under the
hull, I've never looked so fondly at my feet. Their smiling, chubby,
snub-nosed, teardrop forms birled eight feet into the unimpressed, grey,
dour jock air. They juggled fish on their beaks before dining. They
rolled over on their sides like barrels of beer over the fingertips of a
line of draymen. They clowned, they jeered, they disappeared, and came
back again. A synchronised symphony of complete and utter fan-dancing.
Oh, yes, dolphins are special. They're aggressive, they're alive,
they're 12 feet, 661 pounds of fun. And they just want to play.
Without preaching, it must be a sign of the innate frustration and
discomfort that a growing number of people are feeling, that they are
pinning their hopes for a better world on a member of the animal
kingdom. But forgetting the subjective emotional guff, which is
effectively the same publicity codswallop self-help novels and lifestyle
gurus hand out, on how one swim or meeting can change your life for the
better, if there is one thing that dolphins can be accused of, it is of
being the most fantastic ambassadors, of doing the most amazing PR for
the protection of a world we don't know, and the upgrading of the one we
do.

THE Securi Petit rape alarm can be worn, pendant fashion. It's the
size of a powder compact. It can be concealed inside a shirt or coat. In
an emergency, a 122-decibel high-frequency siren is activated by pulling
the cord at the base of the alarm. It costs #12.95.
Given the state of the nation, given the rise in crimes against the
person over the past 12 months, as indicated by the Home Office
Statistical Bulletin 6/94, it is possible that in the future carrying a
personal alarm may be the norm. Society has changed. At one point
high-street store staff were behind the counter, now they are all over
the shop, isolated. The Royal Mail take the issue of personal safety so
seriously that they have issued their unsupervised staff, postmen and
women, who work on the streets with emergency alarms. Alarms are now
used commercially, by anyone who could be at risk. This is an inevitable
development. But who would carry an alarm out of choice and why?
''Ask the poor lassie who's been raped'' (D E, supervisor)
''An alarm depends on noise to make another member of the public aware
that someone's being attacked, but what if you're in your home, or in a
lonely place? What happens then?'' (Shona Mack, student)
''I wouldn't wear a rape alarm day in, day out, only if I had to go
somewhere secluded. Rape is a violation of a very private part of your
life, it's used as a method of degradation. We've heard how Serbian
soldiers use it against women in Bosnia. But I'm not quite in that state
of fear, where I'd carry it around constantly'' (Annette MacMillan,
secretary)
''Most rapes are carried out by people known and trusted by the
victim'' (Mona Child, singer and waitress)
''If a lassie turned up on a date with me wearing a rape alarm, I'd be
gobsmacked. I'd be forced to crack jokes about it, all night, to break
the ice'' (Steve Borland, sales rep)
''I think the only reason that a woman would carry a rape alarm is if
she had been attacked before'' (Barbara Gillies, administrator)
''The police recommend the principle of carrying an alarm. The basis
of its work is not stopping the attacker dead in his tracks, but
alerting potential witnesses. Attackers do not want other people to
recognise them. If a woman is being stalked then setting off the alarm
will draw attention. The problem with conventional alarms is that they
are inconvenient to carry. The Securi Petit emergency alarm is worn
around the neck. Any other alarm on a string would be an illegal weapon
because you could be strangled with it'' (Victor Rosewell, managing
director, Audio Optics Ltd)
* The Securi Petit alarm is available direct from Audio Optics Ltd, PO
Box 3033, Wokingham RG11 4QQ.

BY Inuit standards, it was a three-dog night last night in Alaska.
Cold, among the first nation of the North American continent, is
traditionally measured in much more practical terms than by thermometer.
Conditions are frequently judged by the number of dogs required
indoors, overnight, among the wife and weans, to heat the living
accommodation.
The temperature around the Trossachs probably did not rate more than
one dog, but there will be 500 huskies on the hoof there today, and from
Loch Ard to Alaska, sled-dog mushers are keeping a weather eye open.
Among the forests outside Aberfoyle, 80 teams are contesting the
British championships this weekend. Snow will be a luxury. In its
near-certain absence, huskies will tow wheeled tricycle rigs along dirt
trails in a series of heats of six miles.
But for David Milne, from Dundee, who lines up for the 300-mile Copper
Basin race, near Glennallen, some 150 miles north-east of Anchorage, it
will be a little cooler. There was a foot of snow by Hallowe'en, and the
rivers were already frozen. Snow is now metres deep, and the temperature
is 50 degrees below freezing. Mercury freezes at minus 38 degrees
Farenheit.
Milne, a 32-year-old accountant, finished third when sled-dog racing
was a demonstration event at the Winter Olympics in Albertville three
years ago. He has forsaken his desk on Tayside, however, for the lure of
the wilderness in order to fulfil a lifelong ambition. He wants to
contest the 1158-mile Iditarod, arguably sport's most demanding event,
which begins in March.
To qualify, he must complete the Copper Basin event with his team
intact. If any animal dies on him before Tuesday's scheduled finish,
Milne will automatically be forced out of the race, and debarred from
the Iditarod.
Such rules have been imposed in response to animal humane society
activity in recent years, following a spate of fatalities provoked by
unscrupulous mushers pushing their draft dogs too hard in pursuit of
enormous prizes and commercial rewards.
''Rick Swenson, the record five-time winner of the Iditarod, who
employs me as a handler and trainer, has never had an animal die in
harness,'' says Milne, who looks after the 140 dogs at Swenson's
kennels. They cost more than $50,000 dollars to feed annually, never
mind the vet bills.
Swenson currently enjoys a three-year, $2m pet food contract from
Eukanuba on the back of his dogs' success, but faced with that, and a
$50,000 first prize for the Iditarod, unprincipled opportunists have
pushed animals beyond their limits.
There are random urine and blood tests on every team in the Iditarod,
and the first 10 teams are dope-tested. The mind boggles over the image
of yellow snow packed into test tubes, but that is the reality. ''If you
think it is hard to obtain a urine sample from an athlete, imagine what
it is like from a dog that has run nearly 1200 miles,'' says Milne.
There are two types of mushing: sprint and endurance, and doping has
always been banned in the latter. Until five years ago, mainlining --
injecting dogs immediately before races -- was legal in sprinting, and
using steroids to treat injured dogs remains legal under certain
circumstances.
''Although there are some people I would not work for, the majority
abide by the rules,'' adds Milne, who has put the animals through some
2000 miles of training. He can recognise them all by sight, and calls
them by name. ''We love them, and there is no way we are going to kill
them. Neither Rick nor I are in this to make money. A dog handler is
like an athletics coach, the dogs being the athletes.''
His responsibilities include teaching pups basic skills: fitting their
first harness, teaching them not to chew it, not to jump over the dog
next to them, to stay on the one side. He takes them camping for the
first time, away from the kennels. ''I let them get experience of
drifted snow, of ice, teach them not to be afraid to swim overflows in
the ice. It can take 15 hours a day. But it is not work. It is a love.''
His concern over the 300-mile race is that his team does not run on to
a moose cow with a calf. ''That's the musher's biggest fear,'' explains
Milne. ''A moose does not differentiate between a wolf pack or dog team.
She will attack either.
''But even if I lost a dog to a complete accident, such as run over by
a drunk driver -- a common hazard in Alaska -- I would be forced out of
the race, and consequently out of the Iditarod. If the mandatory
veterinary checks showed I had abused a dog, I would be banned ever from
racing again.''
So if Milne finishes with a healthy team, he will become the first
Scot ever to race the Iditarod. He was given the job by Swenson because
of his skill with animals, learned initially from his parents Charles
and Margaret, who are retriever enthusiasts.
He has a special visa from the US Immigration and Naturalisation
Service, as a world-ranked sportsman -- the one for which European
metric mile champion David Strang did not qualify.
''Racing Rick's second team in the Iditarod is an investment for the
future,'' he says. ''Dogs are uncanny. They learn the way. One year
Swenson was running blind, in a storm. He believed the trail was to the
left, but the lead dogs, who had run the course before, pulled right.
Five miles down the road he came to the check point.''
Which explains why a good lead dog can change hands for $7500. All
animals in a top 16-strong racing team would be worth at least $3000 a
head.
Milne has costed his Iditarod bid at #6900, and hopes to find a
backer. But even without one, he is committed. In addition to the #1000
entry fee, food and snacks for the dogs, plus their blankets, harnesses,
and medication, is budgeted at #1900. Other necessary items include 3000
velcro bootees, to protect the dogs' feet, costing 50 pence each, and
100 lithium batteries for the sledge headlamps, costing a further #1000.
He will go through 60 pairs of gloves and 40 pairs of socks (#300) and
personal food and drink costing #1000.
But he will view every penny well spent if he can tame the snow
wasteland of Alaska.
That is a world which those competing in the Trossachs forests this
weekend, in the fifth of seven heats in the Bakers Complete British Sled
Dog Racing Championships, can only dream about.
''There are no cash prizes,'' says organiser Ron Goldie, who keeps 10
Siberian huskies at his home near Milton of Campsie. ''We have rejected
that because we don't want people pushing the dogs too hard. They come
first, the sport second.
''So though we have the facility to dope test dogs, we have never felt
it necessary. A very good dog would fetch #400 here.''
But his team can reach speeds of 26mph, on wheeled rigs with special
brush bows -- a kind of cow-catcher, which throws the dogs aside if they
are overrun.
With no chance of a moose loose at Loch Ard, the biggest likely
wildlife threat is a squirrel. ''I have had seven dogs and their
harnesses wrapped round the bottom of a tree, barking up at one wee
squirrel,'' he says.
''All for a nice trophy and five minutes of glory.''

ARGOS, which is breaking new ground with involvement in the power
generators' privatisation share sale, yesterday revealed a healthy sales
boost in the run-up to Christmas.
The catalogue-shopping chain said pre-Christmas trading had been 17%
better than in 1993, while there had been a steady growth of 6% in sales
during the whole of last year on a comparable basis.
An increase in store openings led to overall sales 13% above the
#1100m worth of turnover achieved in 1993.
Chairman David Donne said: ''This strong performance reflects our
strategy of providing the consumer with a wide range of competitively
priced merchandise, supported with more catalogues and a successful
advertising and promotions programme.''
Argos, which has been chosen as a share shop for the PowerGen and
National Power share offer, will be announcing its results for 1994 on
Monday, March 20.

CONFIDENCE among firms in the financial services arena has
strengthened for the ninth consecutive quarter, the latest CBI/Coopers &amp;
Lybrand survey reports, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Overall business volumes rose broadly in line with expectations in the
final quarter of 1994 and a further pick-up is expected in the coming
three months, though expectations are less positive than they were in
the first half of last year.
Finance houses recorded the strongest increase in optimism, no doubt
reflecting hopes for higher consumer spending in the months ahead. This
would only be a continuation of the present trend as firms in this field
saw the industry's highest rise in volumes in the second half of 1994.
The latest survey also points to banks and to a lesser extent general
insurers as seeing higher volume. Life insurers, on the other hand, saw
the largest falls in activity along with insurance brokers and
securities traders.
This is not surprising given the pensions mis-selling scandal and the
start of full commission disclosure from the beginning of this year.
Securities traders have been hit by low trading volumes in the stock
market.
John Hayes of Coopers &amp; Lybrand commented: ''The survey pinpoints the
diverging fortunes of the different sectors within the financial
services industry. The banks largely believe that they have identified
what they need to do to move forward in 1995, while in other sectors,
particularly life assurance and building societies, uncertain industry
prospects are creating confusion and concern about the future.''
Building societies showed one of the sharpest falls in confidence in
the survey.
Overall employment in financial services rose for the third
consecutive quarter, the latest showing the fastest growth since 1990.
But this is not expected to last, with most employers seeing a downturn
in the current quarter, particularly those in the insurance sectors.

Travelling seems fraught with pitfalls, but when you get it right you
know you've arrived. Julie Davidson and Jill Crawshaw offer some of
their favourite tips
THE other week, standing in a check-in queue at Harare airport, I
picked a lock with the smallest blade on my pocket-knife. The catch on
the lock had snapped, trapping my air ticket and passport in the smart
leather ''travel organiser'' gifted to me by a tour operator. ''I told
you so,'' I told myself. ''Never travel with anything which locks, and
don't forget your Swiss Army knife.''
Locks on suitcases are more trouble than they're worth. Little
treasures should go into hand luggage, leaving anything else to the
mercy of baggage handlers who, if they're dishonest, are master
locksmiths anyway. Pocket-knives may earn you a frisk at security, but
you won't be suspected of anything more serious than following fashion.
But over the years the voguish Swiss Army knife has been more than a fad
for me. Its corkscrew function has been invaluable in hotels -- why pay
service rates on wine when you can smuggle in your own?
There is a whole industry in ''travel accessories'', most of which you
can do without. I've learned the hard way. I once paid #20 for a
lightweight ''travel handbag'' bought by mail order from a catalogue.
Its scrappy cotton dimensions stored a tube of suncream and a pair of
sunglasses and not much else -- unlike the cheap and cheerful cotton
rucksacks you find in street-markets or ethnic crafts shops.
Pack pocket torches and opera glasses. These are ideal if you want to
appreciate church art for illuminating niches and bringing ceiling
frescos within reach. And if you're a wildlife tourist who likes to read
in bed, stand-up flashlights are essential in tented camps and game
lodges, where electricity is either weakly generated or non-existent.
Overnight flights call for other strategies. Don't lumber yourself
with the full toilet kit from your suitcase, but bring your own socks
and eye mask and put together your own version of the dinky
complimentary kits supplied to business-class travellers. (Some
airlines, but by no means all, now provide similar hand-outs for economy
passengers.) Like British Airways you can get the mini-toiletries from
the Body Shop and keep them in a leak-proof freezer bag.
We can all live without washing our faces and brushing our teeth for
12 hours, but it's hard to face the following day without sleep. Don't
just settle for non-smoking or aisle seats at the check-in, but ask for
a bulkhead seat or one beside an emergency exit, where there's most
legroom. If there are none left, don't give up. Check the availability
of spare seats when you're in the air and don't feel you must stick to
your allocated number. Nag the cabin crew who, once they've served
dinner, tend to disappear into their little curtained galley until
breakfast time.
The happiest discovery on a wide-bodied aircraft is four empty seats
where you can stretch out -- better than an upgrade which, despite
rumours to the contrary, you won't get by telling lies unless it suits
the airline, who may have overbooked economy. Even bona fide travel
writers on economy tickets find it virtually impossible to talk their
way into business class unless authorisation is ''in the computer''. And
on most charter flights the seating is, in any case, one class.
Then there's packing, which doesn't always get easier with experience.
I'm still struggling to get the balance right between ''smart casual'',
as the Americans define informal evening wear, and sloppy casual;
especially in the tropics, where the humidity wrecks clothes and I
always seem to have too many long-sleeved Indian cottons for the
mosi-blighted nights and too few T-shirts for the action-packed days.
Then I look at the laundry charges and feel guilty relief; in Third
World hotels they're shamefully low, and some African safari camps
include free laundry services in their rates.
One thing you don't need to pack in the tropics is hair conditioner.
Hair-washing in Bali or Belize is transforming. Uncontaminated by
chemicals, the filtered rainwater in your hotel shower gives lustrous
body to your limp, polluted capillaries. I don't know why Anita Roddick
hasn't shipped home tankfuls of tropical rainwater and sold it in gallon
containers over the counters of the nation's high streets.
As for those mosquito-blighted nights -- take the little menaces
seriously in malarial areas (globally there are a million deaths a year
from malaria) and stock up on prophylactics. No anti-malarial drug is
foolproof, so the best defence is to get bitten as little as possible.
You can buy effective insect repellent and saturated wrist and ankle
bands from Masta, the retail outlet of the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT.

* SCOTTISH dairy farmers are increasingly expressing concern, so far
in private, at the long term prospects of their shareholdings in
Scottish Pride -- the former commercial arm of the Scottish Milk
Marketing Board.     Since vesting date on November 1, 1994, the shares
-- which opened at 43p -- have fallen to 34p. This represents a sizeable
loss of equity for farmer shareholders who, on average, each hold 1400
of the 30,000,000 issued shares. In financial terms, this means that a
stake at November 1 which was worth #6000, is now only valued at around
#4600.
Scottish Pride has a number of legal actions pending against it,
including a #6m claim by CWS and St Ivel over an alleged loss of assets
in the winding up of the Galloway Cheese Company in Stranraer.

A CHINESE woman has been credited with one world record in the pole
vault, while being denied another because of a positive drug test. The
International Amateur Athletic Federation said yesterday that Sun
Caiyun's vault of 4.05m in May 1992, at Nanjing, was being recognised as
the first women's world record in the event. Since she was only 18 at
the time, the jump was also ratified as a world junior record.
Sun was also in line for a share of the world indoor pole vault record
with a jump of 4.08m in March, 1994, at Karlsruhe, Germany. But the IAAF
said the feat was not recognised as Sun tested positive for ephedrine at
the meet and was suspended for three months. Nicole Rieger, of Germany,
who vaulted 4.08m at the same meet, was credited with the record.

LIFE begins again at almost 30 for Ian McCall today as a Hamilton
Accies player. But where playing in the red and white will feel strange
at first, the voice behind the instructions from the bench certainly
will not.
This will be the third time manager Iain Munro, who persuaded McCall
to join Accies after Falkirk had agreed to give him a free transfer, has
been connected with the midfielder. The first time was at Dunfermline,
when Munro was coach, and before McCall moved to Ibrox for #250,000, and
the second time was when the player, who had returned to East End Park
from Bradford, moved to Dundee when Munro was manager there.
McCall, who has signed until the end of the season, said: ''I'm very
happy. Under Iain, I won a championship medal with Dundee, and reached
the Skol Cup final with Dunfermline.
Munro said yesterday: ''I have always admired the skill of Ian.
Falkirk are involved in the type of premier-division battle which does
not always lend itself to his type of play. He now has a platform again
from which to demonstrate his ability.''
McCall's first test will be at Firhill against bottom club Stranraer,
who still have Steven Cody suspended, and they will be without the
injured Darren Henderson.
Leaders Dundee take on promotion challengers Airdrie in the top match
of the day at Dens Park. Jim Duffy's side snatched a late draw against
St Johnstone in midweek, and the manager probably will give striker
Gerry Britton -- substitute on Wednesday -- a chance to team up with
young Jim Hamilton for the first time from the start. Airdrie stand by
the men who defeated St Mirren.
Dunfermline have goalkeeping problems for their visit to Love Street.
Ian Westwater, who was due to return in place of Jim Will, was injured
in training, so the Fifers will not have a keeper on the bench. If
necessary, midfielder Paul Smith will stand in. Tommy Harrison, signed
on a free from Hearts, joins the squad with the absent Ivo Den Biemen
having to return to Holland because of family problems.
Saints rely on youth again, with Brian Smith (18), Stuart Taylor (19),
and Jamie Fullarton (20) all certain of a place as the Paisley side try
to ease clear of the relegation zone.
Ayr United have Duncan George suspended, and Vinnie Moore, who would
have been his replacement, is injured. Hugh Burns, however, is back in
contention after suspension for the visit of St Johnstone to Somerset
Park. Saints, who are looking much more settled, have one or two knocks
to worry about, but they hope to field the side who got that 2-2 draw
against Dundee.
Still out, though, will be striker Paul Wright, who yesterday refused
an offer which would have made him the highest-paid player ever at
Perth. Instead, the striker, recently recovered from a knee injury which
kept him out for more than a year, signed a one month's contract.
Raith Rovers want to make it five wins in a row when they face
struggling Clydebank at Stark's Park. Raith, who have striker Ally
Graham suspended, will bring back Steven Crawford. Bankies, whose
experienced all-rounder Colin Harris moved to Meadowbank Thistle on a
two-year, player-coaching contract yesterday, have Scott Murdoch
doubtful because of a cold, and full back Paul Agnew still missing,
injured.

IT may appear churlish to point a finger at a Scotland A win over a
country that has qualified for the World Cup, but the quality of
spectacle set before a sporting and patient audience hardly did justice
to an historic occasion at McDiarmid Park.
For the considerable cost of a stand seat nowadays, the supporters are
entitled to more than a dour diet of ruck, punt and penalty attempts.
Much of the forward play did lift the spirit with its cohesion and
momentum. Kevin McKenzie clearly has imbued his frontal colleagues with
his own indomitable spirit, so that they outplayed the Italians not
least in so often getting the initial nudge when they clunked together
at ruck and maul.
Some of the forward drives, in which a revitalised Damian Cronin threw
his hat into the ring, were reminiscent of that early Finlay Calder
inspired tidal wave with which the Scots set their benchmark in the
Grand Slam triumph over England in 1990.
That made it all the more frustrating that such limited use was made
of the ball won. The hope must be that Craig Chalmers will get his
selections right, Gavin Hastings will take up the attack gauntlet, and
Gregor Townsend will have the chance to prise a gap or two so that the
seniors might produce a more rounded strategy against Canada next
Saturday.
It was sad that two of the sharpest wings in Scotland, Craig Joiner
and Cameron Glasgow, hardly received a pass whereas Italy's wider spread
drew such applause as to hint that for many of the game's adherents,
winning is not all that matters.
Playing against the Italians can be akin to taking on Langholm in rain
and slosh at Milntown. They are practised at making it difficult for
opponents to stitch together lengthy spells of action, adept at
preventing or slowing down opposition breakdown ball, which explains
their concession of so many penalties.
They use the offside line as a friendly ally and not only clutter the
midfield, but possess acceleratory pace along their backline as to be
able to place quick pressure on opponents seeking spread.
From one scrummage Eric Peters, then Stewart Campbell, made crashing
dents in the gain line, yet even as they thus sucked in some of the
detached brethern, there remained a flotilla of five Italians, like
flagships at a naval review, positioned line abreast on the open side.
Yet there is nothing new in such blocking operations, and not only did
the Italians manage to bring their wings into the play, but Massima
Bonomi, with clever adjustment in running angle, penetrated Scotland's
midfield as prelude to the Italian try.
Rugby league players face line abreast defences all the time, yet make
handsome breaches because handling is their bread and butter and they
take ball at pace. Nor is anything more likely to wreck continuity of
action than a whole series of lengthy penalty kicks at goal taken
instead of occasional quick tap restarts.
Whereas the Italians used their full back, Luigi Troiani as both extra
man and decoy, there wasn't much opportunity of assessing Rowen Shepherd
as an attack full back. Twice when he intruded at pace he was ignored.
The same could be said of a similar effort by Fergus Wallace, who
inserted himself so frequently into the action points. The cheeky little
punt of exquisite touch with which Wallace surprised the nation, if not
himself, did find the touch from which Peters scored. Yet Shepherd was
up and another overlap beckoned.
Such opportunities are few and far between and so have to be snapped
up by players switched on to using their hands.
That exciting young talent, Joiner, must be hoping the ball will come
his way in advantageous circumstances more against Canada. He drew
attention to his defence reliability but what did we see of his elusive
running and use of the ball? Just one intrusion led him into a three-man
Italian ambush.
Scotland A and their coaches, David Johnston and Hugh Campbell, have
worked hard towards spirited success against South Africa and Italy that
has boosted morale, but higher ambition has to be pursued, so that
victory might be achieved with more style and panache.
It was the French philosopher Jean Lacourte who once said: ''Our rugby
must be released from its prison into the liberty of self-expression.''

January 13.
I was not surprised to hear that the Japanese had not been invited to
the VJ-Day celebrations. Many must be asking why a reconciliation is out
of the question. Last year's D-Day commemoration illustrated the
Government's lack of sensitivity to the feelings of war veterans. It
seems unlikely that the Japanese were snubbed to spare the feelings of
the PoWs and their families.
As the 50th anniversary of the end of the war approaches a new battle
has begun. The Second World War in the Pacific is being replayed. This
time round it is not on the bloody beaches of the islands or in Japanese
cities. There is a battle for the legacy of the war being fought in
newspaper columns.
It's a battle to show that the Allies fought a just war in the
Pacific. If it is true that the Japanese were more barbaric than any
other nation in the conflict, then any action taken by the Allies is
morally justifiable. In this context the bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki appears as an act of humanitarianism. In all the column inches
dedicated to the subject of war crimes and barbarism the use of atomic
weapons against Japanese civilians is omitted. The ''civilised'' nations
of the world seem to have been swept by a collective amnesia. The No
More Hiroshimas initiative has been launched to jog our memories.
At 8.15am on August 6, 1945, a US Air Force bomber destroyed the
Japanese city of Hiroshima with a single atomic bomb. Three days later
the city of Nagasaki suffered a similar fate. About 200,000 people were
killed by the two bombs. Nobody knows the exact figure because many
casualties disappeared without trace. Some were melted by the heat. Some
were burnt in the fire that blazed for three days after the bombing.
Many thousands died later from the painful and lingering effects of
radiation. Harry Truman described the event as the ''greatest thing in
history''.
This was probably the single most barbaric act of the Second World War
and yet it is rarely discussed. Truman and Churchill justified the act
by saying that it forced the Japanese to surrender and therefore saved
Allied soldiers' lives. Others have argued that by bringing the war to
an end the bombings saved the lives of many Japanese. However, it is
well documented that the US intelligence knew that the Japanese were
ready to surrender. I have always refused to accept the idea that the
Japanese are so culturally different from us that they would have
continued the war indefinitely.
If we want to ensure that young people are educated in the horrors of
war the testament of the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is as
important as the memories of British prisoners of war. Over the past few
years the Japanese have apologised for their part in the war. But no-one
from Britain or America has ever apologised for the bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The fact that the Japanese embassy is happy to be excluded from VJ-Day
activities does not detract from the problem. Young people are not being
given a complete picture of the barbarism of the war. This selective
history can only add strength to the prejudices that already exist
against the Japanese and the people of Asia. Much of the barbarism of
the Second World War was justified on the basis that foreigners were
different, that their lives were less important than our own.
Some people say Hiroshima could never happen again, but as long as we
divide people into separate camps, the civilised and the uncivilised,
any act of aggression is deemed justified. Once we start to realise what
ordinary people have in common across the world, then we will have the
basis for peace. I am not sorry that the Japanese will not be at the
VJ-Day jamboree. But I would feel far happier if nobody attended at all.
Perhaps we could all more usefully spend our time campaigning against
the militarism taking place in the here and now.

January 12.
David Spaven is looking for evidence that the majority of people on
the South Side of Glasgow favour the M77 extension (January 12). I have
collected convincing data.
At the end of last year I surveyed a sample of my clients on the
matter. Over 60% of them supported the new road.
The vast majority of those who voted Yes cited the easing of
congestion as the main benefit, with others adding that it would improve
access to the city centre, Edinburgh, and Ayrshire. Six simply replied,
''It's the best thing that could happen to the area.''
Local businessmen like myself are more closely in touch with local
feeling and opinion than imported protesters.
My survey adds to our other knowledge and it is clear that the sooner
the M77 extension is built the better. It will be for the greater good
of the greater number.

KING Solomon was once faced with the difficult task of adjudicating
which of two women was the true mother of a baby. Both claimed maternal
rights with equal vehemence. ''Saw the baby in half,'' Solomon said,
whereupon the true mother gave up her claim. Solomon's ploy worked --
her compassion identified her. The true mother could not bear the
thought that her rightful claim would threaten the life of her baby, and
the story ended happily with the baby being returned to its true mother.
Today the matter could have been decided one way or the other by
examining the genetic fingerprints. But the story is not only about
deciding maternity rights; it is about human attitudes to solving
disputes, not all of which admit such a neat solution or can be decided
by a forensic test.
What about the babies in Bosnia or Chechnya who are caught in the
crossfire? Where does their birthright and their future lie? Surely not
in a mass grave, but that is where it will end if the warring factions
cannot live and let live.
Or let us bring the matter closer to home. We live in a system of
political union (the UK and EC) which does not always work to our
benefit in Scotland. In order to coexist we make compromises, accept
inequities, and await improvements. We are not justified in tearing
apart society or starting civil war in order to assert our claim of
right. Instead we choose debate and consultation before we embark on
constitutional change.
That is as it should be, and thankfully as it stands this week in
regard to our position in the UK and the EC.
Vehement views
Whatever conclusion is reached, inevitably some will have to live with
a solution which they did not desire. Will they accept it or will they
demand the rights of another mother country and threaten the baby's
life?
It is not only constitutional questions which demand compromise; the
reason I have raised the topic is because of the prevalence of the
''true mother'' syndrome in all kinds of issues. Abortion, animal
rights, gay rights, disabled rights, and the M77 are but several
high-profile topics which attract vehement views.
This is partly because of the way people involved have chosen to
promote their cause, putting principle before pragmatism. However I am
conscious that these groups may look like militant minorities, but their
attitude seems to be inherent in the Scottish character.
Churches are particularly adept at bringing it out, and I don't mean
the big issues of life and death. It is an attitude of mind. What
hymnbook is used, or whether the congregation stand for the entry of the
Bible, or what size of communion cup is used and whether it should
contain wine -- these are the stuff of which dissent is made, and
dissent is the one industry which has failed to decline in Scotland.
Even lapsed Protestants nurture thrawn dissent as a kind of virtue.
''You'll no get me daein' that!''
A terrible thought struck me last week. When it comes to vehemence
about constitutional matters, Bosnia and Chechnya are a bit like our own
dear Scotland 300 or 400 years ago. This, of course, is not politically
correct in that it implies I am suggesting Scotland is hundreds of years
ahead of these countries in terms of civilisation.
The difference is that we tend to be vehement about luxuries like veal
and ramps for wheelchairs. They saw the baby in half while we argue over
whether the baby's bathwater will pollute the environment. It has to be
progress.
Spiritual crisis
Nevertheless, the overt unhappiness within our society is a disturbing
trend, as John Macleod and Steve Bruce pointed out on the opposite page
earlier this week. The former highlighted the growth of grouchiness and
the latter the prevalence of discontent despite an enormous leap in our
standard of living.
Taken together they pinpoint a spiritual crisis which is unlikely to
be solved by constitutional reform or better job prospects for the
disabled or saving calves from a cruel death. I am not belittling any of
these aims (indeed I find all of them totally worthy) but they need to
be seen in context.
The context is an existential crisis in Europe and North America. Its
civilisation has peaked -- in biblical terminology it has been through
the desert period, arrived in the Promised Land, survived the
rough-tough period of the judges and the corruptness of divine-right
kings, only to have been absorbed into an empire which has grown rotten
and corrupt and whose people are diverted by bread and circuses.
Into such a world came Jesus of Nazareth 2000 years ago. We have not
progressed. Only the clock has revolved around to the same place. We
have a better welfare system than the Roman Empire but still cannot
bring ourselves to adopt the Christian principle that compassion is the
first and last principle.
It may not help us to decide what form of government to adopt, but it
sure beats sawing children in half.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has astonished the United Nations
and Western leaders by ordering 12,000 or more UN troops from Croatian
territory. The dangers of this situation are obvious. His aim is to
regain control over the one-third of Croatia which was seized by Krajina
Serbs in 1991 and which is currently patrolled with gentle irrelevance
by UN units. However, an assault by the Croats on Krajina Serbs is only
too likely to bring in Bosnian Serbs, Belgrade Serbs, and the former
Yugoslav Army. If this is brinkmanship it is being conducted on the edge
of a particularly nasty abyss. Undoubtedly it is wrong-headed,
dangerous, and irresponsible, but it should not be unexpected. The fact
that Western leaders have been so obviously wrong-footed by Tudjman's
action illustrates yet again the failure of attempts to comprehend local
politics. Much of this can be characterised by superficial Western
attempts to put black or white hats on Balkan politicians. These have
been an idiotic exercise in self-delusion.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia richly earned his black hat as
one of the most single-minded fomenters of the war in former Yugoslavia.
His belated recognition of the damage done to Serbia by sanctions led
him to soften his position and earn a grey hat. His opportunistic
imposition of sanctions on fellow Serbs in Bosnia led to warm
appreciation of him as a ''peacemaker'', and a white hat. All of this is
nonsense, as was the change of hat for Tudjman who was correctly
identified originally as a neo-communist conservative with despotic
instincts on the side. He was responsible for the destruction of the
Croat-Muslim agreement in Bosnia but his acceptance of the US-brokered
deal which reunited Croats and Muslims in Bosnia earned him a snowy
white hat. His Government hawks were reined in, the IMF was welcomed to
Croatia, and the European Commission patted him on the back. Now he is
in deep disfavour once more, with German, American, French, and British
officials haranguing him in private and Sir Michael Rose pointing out
bleakly that the departure of the UN from Croatia would make the Bosnian
operation even more problematic.
It is true that unpleasant people must be dealt with pragmatically in
the course of trying to secure peace, but it is wise to remember that
Balkan politicians are every bit as pragmatic and usually twice as
nasty. Tudjman has been propelled into this attempt to regain lost
territory partly by the fact that several areas of Croatia want more
autonomy from his Government. Unless he can demonstrate control and
success quickly, that process will accelerate. His army is stronger now
and he feels the time is ripe for the military option. The UN, with its
hapless attempts to keep the peace in former Yugoslavia when no proper
peace existed, is powerless in this situation. The international Contact
Group, which promoted a peace plan for Bosnia which it is now engaged in
watering-down because of Serb objections, must bear some of the blame.
Only committed, relentless bullying of Tudjman by Western leaders might
force him to change his mind. What comes after that, or even before it,
is anyone's guess.

FRAMLINGTON has launched its personal pension and free-standing AVC
plans which are designed to be flexible and have low charges.
The plans will carry a flat rate annual fee of #100 in the first year
and #50 thereafter plus a 5% charge on each contribution to the plan,
reducing to 3% for amounts of #2000 or more, plus a 0.4% annual
management fee.
The policies are sold direct so carry no commission charges.
Contributions can be monthly or annually and can be stopped and
restarted at will. There are no transfer penalties for early opting out.
SAVE &amp; Prosper has announced terms of another guaranteed stock market
bond which will provide a guaranteed 30% return over 5[1/2] years plus
the potential of up to 75% growth, depending on the performance of the
stock market.
M&amp;G has launched a range of pension plans with a clear charging
structure. Initially 100% of all contributions are charged to the
policyholder's account and charges are deducted from this so that it is
clear exactly what the charges are.
TOWRY Law has produced a free booklet on financial questions affecting
the over-55s and a copy can be obtained by calling a freephone number,
0800 521196.
GT Management is to launch a High-Yield Fund to take advantage of the
new PEP rules announced in the Budget. It has been launched in advance
of April 6, when the rules take effect, to counter the possibility that
corporate bonds and convertibles, on which the new PEPs will be based,
will rise in advance of the start date.
The fund will offer a gross yield of 8[1/2]% and unitholders can
switch into a GT PEP in April without charge. Minimum investment is
#1000 and the charges are 4% initially and 1% annually, taken from
capital.

SCOTTISH Livestock Services have purchased the top Charolais bull,
Garner Editor, in a private deal at an undisclosed price. He was sired
by Brigadoon Ulsterman, out of Beeford Angelina.
Garner Editor progeny have had a string of successes in the last two
years at the Scottish Agricultural Winter Fair, the Royal Smithfield
Show, and other major events. At the recent Garner herd dispersal, many
of his half-sisters made high prices, including the 17,000gns female
record for the UK.
Mr Ian Millar of Lochend Farm, Port of Menteith, originally purchased
Editor at the Perth bull sales.
Jack Lawson, managing director of Scottish Livestock Services, stated:
''Artificial insemination is growing in popularity among beef herds.
Sires of this proven calibre are just not available for natural
service.'' Semen from Garner editor is now available with no further
royalties for pedigree breeding.

IN HIS interview with The Herald at the beginning of this week, Angus
Grossart, chairman of the trustees of the National Galleries of
Scotland, expressed his confidence in the ''delivery factor'' associated
with the city of Glasgow: if the city wants something to happen, it
moves heaven and earth to make sure that it does. That does not quite
square with the 44 years it took to construct a building to house the
collection of Sir William Burrell, but more recent arts capital projects
have had a better notion-to-realisation time. The impetus provided by
the city's annus mirabilis produced the concert hall and the refurbished
McLellan Galleries, and the empire of museums and galleries director Mr
Julian Spalding has continued to expand with the highly praised St Mungo
museum and now the conversion of Stirling's Library into a gallery of
modern art. None of these, however, is deemed to have significantly
altered Glasgow's position in Glasgow Development Agency's notional
league of European cities in the way that the presence of a national
institution would do. While the commitment of the trustees to a Glasgow
site (now widely expected to be the post office building in George
Square) has never wavered since they made that decision -- in the face
of strong opposition from Edinburgh and a lukewarm response from the
Scottish Office -- the fear in Glasgow has been that the proposal was
becoming so diluted that the city's National Gallery would be an
institution not worthy of the name.
What emerged at Thursday night's open meeting in Glasgow University's
Bute Hall was the public face of the Glasgow ''delivery factor''.
Misgivings were cast aside as the lure of a real prize once again
glinted before ambitious eyes. Despite the rearguard action being fought
by certain individuals from the capital, it was clear that there is more
common ground than disagreement between the trustees and those whose
co-operation and political will will be necessary to bring the proposal
for a National Gallery of Scotland in Glasgow to fruition. However, city
council leader Mr Pat Lally is quite correct: that name will not do,
unless the longer-established building on the Mound acquires the suffix
''in Edinburgh''. Working titles have a way of passing into common
parlance and if the new gallery is to show the best of Scotland's
creativity in the past two centuries -- as the meeting appeared to
resolve -- its name should reflect that. Herald readers will doubtless
have their own opinions on that.

The seeds of the successes of the Glasgow International Folk Festival
were sown in a German barracks, as Andrew Young discovers.
THERE were not many singing the praises of Charlie Harrigan when he
took over the running of Glasgow International Folk Festival six years
ago. He had arrived, guns blazing, criticising petty in-fighting that
had been tearing the scene apart. Some of the things he was quoted as
saying in a Herald article in 1989 caused a furore that rattled on in
the correspondence columns until it reached its must-cease-by date.
No-one likes criticism, particularly folk folk in a world of cosy
sentimentality. He sees that article as a catalyst that broke down
frontiers -- eventually.
The folk scene had been on the decline from its high of the fifties
and sixties. In Glasgow it was a financial mess. Harrigan will tell you
he must have been mad to touch it when he still had his day job as
something in computers. He was a hopeless organiser. But he was prepared
to learn. He brought in Simon Leslie Carter who showed him how to get
his act together.
Now the festival is running to budget. Has done for the past four
years. Carter, with 25 years' experience as something in Middle East
oil, was an outside force who could view things dispassionately. He
introduced the missing factor, one that was alien to most folkies: sound
business practices. He has gone on to other things, but the pattern he
set is still being used.
With Harrigan at the helm, the festival became artistically broader,
more interesting each year. You never knew what idea he was going to
pursue next that would give that added frisson. MP Tony Benn as half a
double act at the Tron. The Asian community is now involved.
People are actually saying nice things about him behind his back these
days. Admittedly it was something of a back-handed compliment when Billy
Connolly told Melvyn Bragg on The South Bank Show that Charlie Harrigan
was one of the people who never let him forget that his roots were in
folk.
But Dougie MacLean, one of Scotland's heroes, is unstinting: ''There's
so much talk in this business and very little action. Charlie talks. And
acts as well. His enthusiasm has never faltered. Every time I meet him
he's got some new plan up his sleeve. That's great.'' It was his
never-ending enthusiasms that made some of the more jaded souls regard
him as naive. He was that rarity, someone who looked forward in an art
form that was about looking back.
Three significant things he regards as ground-clearing happened to
Harrigan in 1994. He became unmarried, for the second time. He reached
the big 40. And he cast off the good suits he wore as a computer
salesman, enabling him to concentrate full-time on what he really loves
-- folk.
Legend has it that his first wife was Miss Calgary Stampede. Close,
but wrong. Her name was Janice and she was one of the girls taking part
in the Medicine Hat Rodeo, a run-up event to ''the greatest show on
earth'', 150 miles due west in Calgary. They spent their honeymoon in a
log cabin at Ghost Lake on the Stoney Indian reserve on the foothills of
the Rockies. He seemed drawn to places with interesting names and
romances that would fall asunder, as though fate had in mind that songs
might be written.
Rab Noakes, singer, administrator, festival board member, a man with a
homespun way with words, says: ''I've kent Charlie for a long time. He's
a guy of some hidden depths, never to be underestimated.'' At the time
of the stampedes in the mid-seventies he was actually in the army, based
in Germany, on temporary posting to Canada. On leaving Paisley's
Camphill Senior Secondary, he enlisted for 22 years, with a six-year
opt-out clause.
Initial training was at Middle Wallop, Hampshire. With REME (Royal
Electrical and Mechanical Engineers) he was a hopeless spanner bender
but was taught to chart unscheduled faults in aircraft.
He was posted to Germany in 1971 when the old red bear of Russia was
still a menace. There was no English-language television or videos. Just
the SKC -- Services Kinema Corporation. So there was a huge demand for
live entertainment.
He sang, played guitar. Eventually took over the running of a
folk-club in the Naafi at Bunde. The seed was planted that now
flourishes in Glasgow.
In his travels, the small world thing was constantly brought home to
him. In Medicine Hat he had appeared on stage with Billy Connolly who
was doing one of his strolling gigs. Ian Hamilton, QC, the Stone of
Destiny man, was practising law there at the same time.
Artists he was booking in Germany included Hamish Imlach and Alex
Campbell. Also Cilla Fisher and Archie Tresize, now of The Singing
Kettle. It was Imlach who first gave him the definition of a
folk-singer: Someone who stays in bed all day, then goes out at night
and sings about work.
It turned out to be a glorious spring and summer in 1977. He made
friends, naturally, with island musicians like Norman Johnston and Calum
Iain MacCorkindale. And he remembers exactly where he was when they were
lighting bonfires the length of the land in celebration of the Queen's
Silver Jubilee. He was taking part in a ceilidh in the courtyard of a
doughnut-shaped mansion belonging to the local lord on North Uist.
He and Janice emigrated to Calgary. He got a job selling computers for
a major North American conglomerate. On the side, he hosted a wee
programme on QCTV, Channel 13. Dougie MacLean, recently back from
appearing at Carnegie Hall, New York, made his North American debut on
the show. The studio door was always open for Scots -- such as the
Tannahill Weavers from Paisley.
He returned to his own folks in Paisley in 1980 after his first
divorce. His dad was janitor at Paisley Grammar School watching people
like Andrew Neil and Sheila Douglas passing through the gates. He did
regular performing stints in Oslo and at Norwegian ski resorts. Tich
Frear was on the same trail. But it was one big party and eventually he
had to pull himself together. A series of more computer-related jobs
followed, several of them high-flying.
He met his second wife, Janet, in Babbity Bowsters, in Glasgow's
Merchant City. They were married in 1987. She had been a jobbing
scientist, working part time for her PhD. After graduating as Dr
Harrigan she went off to a university job in Sweden. He reckons the 1989
festival cost him about #2000. And his involvement with subsequent
festivals probably cost him his marriage, too.
Glasgow's Year of Culture, 1990, marked the upturn. It showed a slight
deficit that year but has been on target since then. He praises Bob
Palmer, director of performing arts, for pulling the various festivals
together, providing Glasgow with continuity of entertainment through the
tourist season. And, with no false modesty, he prides himself in always
being a man of vision.
He has had ideas that have stirred interest. Such has getting Tony
Benn at the Tron doing readings about 1000 years of injustices, to
musical accompaniment from Roy Baillie. The Jaleo Flamenco Ensemble from
Seville was a complete knock-out, and now fills the Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall. Lonnie Donegan was brought back to his home town.
Harrigan is also performing more again. There is another double act,
Harrigan and Hotchkiss -- Gordon Hotchkiss is a concertina player and
Paisley town-planner.
Harrigan sees the folk label as now covering a very broad church --
appropriate, as the hub of the festival is now the Tron, which was a
church -- encompassing the whole of world music. It is more acoustically
based than during the eighties when it was all technology. And he
welcomes a spirit of co-operation with the new directors of Mayfest and
the Glasgow Jazz Festival.
Instead of slagging each other off, the directors are ''putting bits
of glue between the festivals'', working towards a city product,
something close to the heart of Pat Lally.
Harrigan will tell you he never got higher than sergeant in the army
and never endeared himself to the computer bosses because no-one could
put a collar on him. Now he is his own man.

History judges Mary Queen of Scots harshly and Elizabeth I of England
with favour. But what were the circumstances that contributed to their
fate, and to what extent was their gender a handicap? John Macleod
investigates the lives -- and loves -- of both women.
JOHN KNOX once said that ''to promote a woman to bear rule,
superiority, dominion or empire above any realm, nation, or city, is
repugnant to nature, contumely to God, a thing most contrarious to His
revealed will and approved ordinance; and finally it is the subversion
of good order, of all equity and justice . . . ''
The Reformer had reason to grump. When he penned these words in 1558,
beginning his celebrated First Blast of the Trumpet Against the
Monstrous Regiment of Women, it seemed ladies of a peculiarly thrawn
type had seized control of the known world. His native Scotland quailed
under the regency of Mary of Guise, widow of King James V; and she ruled
in the name of her teenage daughter, newly wed in France. In France the
ferocious Catherine de Medicis dominated the wimpish princes about her.
And in England, Mary Tudor was busy barbecuing Protestants.
Are women well suited to wield authority? The question itself, in
1994, veers on blasphemy. The girls have demanded liberation, and got
it. Virtually no sphere of life, save perhaps the ministry of certain
churches, is barred to them. Professions that were once deemed male
bastions -- the law, medicine, the groves of academe, the Civil Service,
Parliament, the media -- are now well-stocked with females.
Yet it remains striking how few positions of importance in these
fields are held by women. Only a handful have ever sat in the British
Cabinet. There are few woman judges, few woman editors; has there ever
been a female Permanent Secretary? For 40 years we have had a woman on
the throne. We survived a decade with a woman as Prime Minister. But, as
far as true practical authority is concerned, the female of the species
has a long way to go.
In Knox's day, queens were no mere ornaments. These queens were
executives. In an age to which equality, popular liberty, and even
religious tolerance were virtues wholly undiscovered, monarchs and
monarchy mattered.
Two queens were to govern neighbouring realms. Both had close ties of
blood. Both ruled at a time of much tumult and excitement; the
Renaissance had spawned the Reformation, and European monarchs suddenly
found themselves personally in charge of national religion.
These two women viewed each other with considerable emotion -- fear,
envy, curiosity, spite, and contempt. But to the day that the one sent
the other to the block, Elizabeth I and Mary Stuart never met. History's
failure to stage that spectacular encounter spoils the romantic inside
each of us. Yet it adds a frisson to the debate: how did the two compare
as sovereigns -- and did their sex have anything to do with it?
WE ARE apt to view Mary Stuart as a hapless, doomed heroine, wronged
by all about her, at length destroyed by her own kinswoman. But to judge
history by such factors is quite irrational. These women were heads of
government. On their competence and character rested the wellbeing of
their nations.
By all logical criteria, Elizabeth was by far the greater. She died,
old and full of days, the awe of the world, leaving England more stable,
more prosperous, and more mighty than she had found it. She was the last
true medieval monarch. Mary Queen of Scots was entrusted the real power
for less than seven years; so incompetently did she exercise it that she
spent her final two decades in exile and jail. Mary Queen of Scots got
her head chopped off. That is scarcely an impressive achievement.
They were closely related. Henry VIII, Elizabeth's father, was brother
to Margaret Tudor, consort of James IV and Mary's grandmother. Both
Elizabeth and Mary were tall for their day -- at five foot eleven
inches, Mary would be a tall girl even in 1994 -- red of hair, fair of
face, and both admired for their long elegant hands. They shared the
customary graces expected of young noble women. They were skilled
musicians, singers, versifiers; and they were fluent in several
languages.
Their divergent fates cannot be blamed on differing circumstances. If
anything, Elizabeth's childhood was much the more traumatic. Mother, and
step-mothers, died suddenly; two were beheaded. Treason plots in the
reigns of her siblings -- the Somerset affair under Edward VI; the Wyatt
revolt under Mary I -- both threatened her position. Her half-sister
clapped her for a time in the Tower, and came close to ordering her
execution.
Mary Stuart lost her father when she was only seven years old. Before
her fifth birthday she was dispatched to France, betrothed in all but
name to the Dauphin. The next 14 years, until the agonising death of her
boyish husband, were as dull as they were frivolous.
Nor can we blame genetics. Elizabeth's father was a tyrant and her
mother an equally ruthless woman -- if ultimately a loser. Mary Stuart's
line, though unfortunate -- a succession of Stewart monarchs died young,
leaving infant successors and long minority reigns -- were gifted
people. Mary of Guise was a skilled operator and something of a wit. She
spurned an offer of marriage from Henry VIII with the dry remark that,
despite her tall body, she had a small neck.
The fact remains that Elizabeth was a magnificent politician. Mary was
lousy. Elizabeth was a great Queen. Mary was a disaster. Elizabeth had
character; Mary had little, and this we shall now explore.
She was, in truth, more French than Scots. When she returned to assume
personal rule, in 1561, she had been in France almost as far as she
could remember. And she had been raised, from infancy, to see her life's
destiny as Queen Consort of France. She had been encouraged entirely to
forget she was Queen of a realm in her own right. Call it brainwashing;
but, for Mary Stuart, like the French court, Scotland was a remote,
half-barbarous realm.
Not only had she blithely signed away her birthright on marriage. It
was bad enough that the public treaty of betrothal conferred the Crown
Matrimonial on Dauphin Francis; the private treaty -- which the Scots
delegates never saw -- conferred the Scottish crown and succession on
the Dauphin and his family, in the event that Mary died without issue.
But, from the day of her widowhood, throughout her personal reign -- and
until the last fatal weeks of her life -- Mary then centred her
ambitions on the English succession. She dared to adopt English arms on
the death of Mary Tudor -- an insult to Elizabeth and a direct threat to
Scottish interests.
At the time she married the Dauphin, and lightly resigned so much,
Mary was 16 years old. The contrast with Elizabeth is instructive. She
was only 15 when Thomas Seymour's conspiracy -- to seize control of
Edward VI and make wife of Elizabeth -- was exposed. Elizabeth stood in
peril of position and life. Yet she stood up coolly to interrogation.
She refused to sign a false confession. She fought for the liberty of
staff who had shown her loyalty.
Both women, by the lights of their day, exhibited piety. Elizabeth
despised the Mass and stood for what we would now call Low Church
Anglicanism; Mary went under the axe exulting in Catholic martydrom. But
Elizabeth had no doubt of her duty as a ruler -- to impose a national
religious order; to establish unformity of established religion, while
allowing a degree of private liberty. (It was not until late in her
reign, excommunicated by the Pope and with Spain out to destroy her,
that she sanctioned a deplorable persecution of Roman Catholics.) Mary
was a convinced Romanist. Yet she made no effort to impose the old faith
on Scotland.
To our day this seems admirable; in that time it was irresponsible.
Kings were expected to set a consistent line in faith. Mary's conduct in
this regard was manifest evidence of weakness. It puzzled the French,
angered the Spanish and infuriated the Pope.
The list may be continued indefinitely. From the moment of accession,
Elizabeth created the Council of England in her own image, with men
whose loyalty she trusted; yet, with particular maturity, she
deliberately encouraged those such as Burghley and Walsingham to speak
their mind before her -- even in dissent. Mary, arriving in Scotland,
scarcely altered the council she inherited -- packed as it was with
ideological opponents, timeservers, and empire-builders. Elizabeth made
attendance at council a matter of conscience. Mary seldom bothered to
go.
Elizabeth, of course, never married; all her days, then, she left her
statesmen in a lather of uncertainty over the succession. But she did
not bring her country into the bondage of a foreign prince. Nor did she
risk marrying into the English nobility -- a sure recipe for faction.
Nor -- above all -- did she put herself, and her considerable talent in
statecraft, at the mercy of a mere husband.
Mary, as we have seen, was happy to bring Scotland under France. When
she married Darnley, she brought the realm under an unstable drunkard.
Scarcely a tear was shed for the wretch when he died in the chaos of
Kirk O'Field. But Mary quickly made scandal from crisis. She made the
barest pretence of mourning. Within weeks she married the Earl of
Bothwell -- the chief suspect in Darnley's murder.
She was incurably romantic, a tool of her own emotions. Whether the
notorious ''Casket Letters'' were forgery or no, there can be no
doubting her infatuation with Bothwell. Nor is the endless debate over
Kirk O'Field of edification. If Mary knew of the plot in advance, she
was a murderess as unprincipled as she proved incompetent. If she did
not, she showed herself wholly out of touch with affairs; tout Edimbourg
knew of the conspiracy.
One man, and one man alone, kept Mary in her position -- her bastard
half-brother, the Earl of Moray. Moray was perhaps the best of all the
Stewarts -- brave, resourceful, profoundly principled. He had done much
to protect Mary from her own folly. Now her continued reign imperilled
the state itself. So Mary was overthrown and the infant James VI crowned
in her stead.
There remained the escape from Loch Leven. Even in 1568 -- so
unpopular was the regime, so reluctant were Scots to depose their lawful
sovereign, and was not Bothwell now rotting in a foreign jail? -- men
rallied to the fugitive queen's cause; she could have regained the crown
without much difficulty. Instead she drove boldly too close to Glasgow,
fought and lost a totally unnecessary battle at Langside, and then --
ignoring every dictate of common sense -- fled straight to England.
Had she stayed in Scotland, her cause was still viable; at worst,
captured, her life was safe. Had she made France, she would have found
at least a haven and perhaps help. In England, she found only prison and
a distant, enraged cousin whom she now acutely embarrassed.
There remained two decades of house-arrest, in which time Mary
forfeited what slender grasp of political reality she had ever
possessed. In 1586 she fell readily into the supervised honey-trap that
was the Babington conspiracy; she rapidly committed to writing her
delight in the proposed assassination of Elizabeth, and in 1587, tried
and condemned -- and before Elizabeth could change her mind -- Mary
Stuart forfeited her life.
Romance cannot hide the reality. She was more unfortunate than
Elizabeth, more beautiful than Elizabeth, more sickly than Elizabeth.
But Elizabeth, old ruthless hag that she became, was by far the abler
ruler. She loved power, and was fascinated by the art of politics; for
Mary, power meant only baubles and status. In prison, after 1568, it was
not the loss of her throne on which she harped to her jailers, but the
theft of her jewels.
ELIZABETH I was, perhaps, the last woman to wield such power in the
British Isles until Mrs Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979. There
have been, since, other queens regnant; but by then the English Civil
War, and the Revolutions of 1688-89, had created a limited monarchy;
today Britain is a republic in all but name.
Our queens had one obvious difficulty: they were unable, by virtue of
being women, to take the field. Elizabeth, in fact, had an excellent
grasp of military affairs, field tactics, and overall strategy. Yet she
had to watch helplessly as her officers defied orders and botched simple
assignments; the successes of Drake against the Spanish, and the
destruction of the Armada, veil the reality that almost every martial
effort in Elizabeth's reign ended in failure.
Further, Mary and Elizabeth had each to confront the implications of
their personal sexuality. Was it possible, then, for a queen regnant to
marry? History suggests not. Mary Tudor degraded England -- and lost
Calais -- for Philip of Spain. Elizabeth chose to be the Virgin Queen.
Mary's husbands, and Mary's alleged lovers, threatened the order of her
kingdom and destroyed her reputation.
Elizabeth Tudor, and Margaret Thatcher, and many another, demonstrated
that women can -- in given circumstances -- wield power effectively. The
differing psychology of a woman, as Thatcher found with her Cabinet, can
be an effective weapon in argument. Sexual appeal, of the sort wielded
by Eva Peron or Imelda Marcos, could be deployed with care. There is
also the She-Bear element: the utter ferocity, the incredible
concentrated passion with which a woman can pursue an aim, in defence --
or pursuit -- of mate and offspring.
Yet the paradox that haunted Mary and Elizabeth abides; that for most
women, professional success -- and the attainment of power and status in
their own right -- depend on postponing, if not indeed forgoing, sexual
expression, marriage, and children.
The Virgin Queen proved great. All her correspondence with her
wretched cousin exudes a patronising air that descends, eventually, into
open contempt. Yet, when word was brought from Scotland that Mary had
borne a child, Elizabeth briefly crumbled. ''The Queen of Scots is light
of a bonny son,'' she cried, ''and I am but barren stock.''
To the loser in history, one lonely triumph. With Elizabeth died in
1603 the last descendant of Henry VIII. And she was succeeded by that
same ''bonny son''; he, and all his successors on the throne to our own
day, prince upon prince, owed that place to the blood and genes of
unhappy Mary Stuart.

ONE of the best books of 1995 is bound to be John Nunn's latest book,
John Nunn's Best Games (#17.99, Batsford). The good doctor (PhD in
maths), one of England's leading grandmasters, is in my view Britain's
foremost writer on chess. Once again he has successfully mixed fun with
instruction in a book which is both a joy to read and also immensely
didactic.
Nunn's book analyses 40 of his best games in the period 1985-1993. It
begins where a previous book Secrets of Grandmaster Play ended, in the
middle of the annual Wijk an Zee tournament, in early 1985. It takes in
games against the world's top players, including the occasional lesser
foe -- I am one of Nunn's victims in a game played in the 1985
Bundesliga.
Characteristically objective, and absurdly modest at the same time,
Nunn omits one of his wins in this period against the current FIDE world
champion, Anatoly Karpov. The great Russian blundered badly in time
trouble, so the game is not good enough to meet Nunn's high standards.
Every game in the book has been chosen to illustrate the best in
chess. Nunn's analysis is, as ever, fresh and thorough. He provides
fascinating insights into the psychological aspects of the game and the
off-the-board world of the globetrotting professional grandmaster. This
book is well worth the admittedly rather steep cover price.
The New Bogo Indian (#10.99, Cadogan), by Shaun Taulbut, is a
commendable new openings book, which explains how to play one of Black's
best defences against 1 d4. Here is a forceful demonstration of the
merits of the defence in one of the main lines.
White: S. Skembris
Black: A. Belyavsky
Igalo 1994
Bogo-Indian Defence
1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nf3 Bb4+ 4 Bd2 Qe7 5 g3 Nc6 6 Bg2
The main alternative is 6 Nc3, after which the most solid reply is 6 .
. . d5.
6 . . . Bxd2+ 7 Nbxd2
Black has good equalising chances in this line because White's knight
is forced to the rather passive square d2 rather than c3. If 7 Qxd2,
intending 8 Nc3, 7 . . . Ne4 8 Qc2 Qb4+ is good.
7 . . . d6 8 0-0 e5 9 d5 Nb8 10 e4 a5 11 Ne1 0-0 12 Nd3 Na6 13 a3
White controls more space and plans further expansion on the queenside
with b4. However, with his bishop hemmed in by his many pawns on white
squares, White may be vulnerable to just the sort of queenside
counterplay Black shortly stirs up in this game.
13 . . . Bg4 14 f3 Bd7 15 b4 c6!
This is an important improvement on 15 . . . axb4 16 axb4 c6 17 dxc6
bxc6, previously known in this position, after which the open a-file
acts in White's favour.
16 Qb3?
White should still play 16 dxc6. Now Black exploits an opportunity to
bring his queen's knight and bishop to life via the b5 square.
16 . . . cxd5 17 cxd5 axb4 18 axb4 Nc7 19 Qb2 Bb5 20 Ra3 Rxa3 21 Qxa3
Ba6 22 Rc1 Nb5 23 Qa5 Nd4 24 Bf1 Nh5!
Now Black prepares to open play on a second front, the kingside. His
queen threatens to penetrate on the black squares via g5 and he also
plans . . . f5, opening up prospects for his rook on the f-file.
25 Nf2 Be2 26 Rc3 Qg5 27 Qa2 f5 28 exf5!?
White's position is lifeless. Perhaps 28 Bg2 was a little better, but
Black has all the play in any case.
28 . . . Qxf5 29 Bg2 Nf6 30 Rc7?!
In great difficulties, White understandably tries to make an active
break for counterplay. It loses quickly.
30 . . . Bxf3 31 Rxb7 Ng4 32 Nxg4 Bxg4 33 Nf1 Ne2+ 34 Kh1 Bf3 35 Nd2
Nxg3+ White resigns
Or if 36 hxg3 Qh3+ and mates.

Some may have come unstuck since, but 1981 was definitely the year of
the double-act, discovers David Belcher.
SOME of the romantic partnerships consecrated so joyously in 1981, as
pictured here, lasted longer than others. The marriage of Mr and Mrs
Chuck Windsor rather famously fell by the wayside, unlike the
enduringly-happy act of union between Mr and Mrs Jim Sillars.
Perhaps passion is strongest when it goes unrequited, which maybe
explains the lasting celluloid lure of Gregory's Girl, released the same
year. In Bill Forsyth's movie John Gordon Sinclair failed to impress the
footballing object of his desire, Dee Hepburn. All these duos feature in
tomorrow's second edition of Time of Your Life, Scottish Television's
look back at our lives and times in the eighties.
Additionally, the programme will be employing archive footage in order
to recall the martyr's death of IRA hunger-striker Bobby Sands and the
assassin's attempt on the life of Pope John Paul II.
1981 was a year of appearances and disappearances. Alcohol was
thankfully banished from Scottish football terraces, hastening the
game's progress into the twentieth century, while oor verra ain Sunday
Standard made its debut.
And what soundtrack will be playing tomorrow evening? Simple Minds and
Aztec Camera are still around in 1995, although with line-ups vastly
reduced from those which recorded Love Song and We Could Send Letters
respectively. Sheena Easton has survived, unlike the James Bond movie
series for which she provided the theme to For Your Eyes Only.
In contrast, Ultravox are no longer lurking with the type of
portentous synth-pomp which made Vienna less a waltz, more a plodding
square-dance. And Altered Images altered so much that they dissolved
entirely. Their cutey-pie anthems, Happy Birthday and I Could be Happy,
linger on nevertheless.
Oddly, Time of Your Life can find no room for Hold Me, a blues-belting
marriage between B A Robertson and Maggie Bell which distinguished the
charts in 1981. We will be able, however, to grind our teeth to a song
by one of Scottish showbiz's longest-lasting marital double-acts: the
Krankies, whose Fan-Dabi-Dozi was less than fan-tabby-tastic.

TRAWLING the backwaters of Scottish history as I do for forgotten
scraps and snippets, I've occasionally been asked which year has
provided the most successful haul, a catch to savour. Difficult one
that.
Perhaps surprisingly, when you consider all the excitement which
punctuates Scottish history, my selection would have to be the year 1820
-- 12 months which, from a newsman's point of view at least, have all
the action you could ask for.
This particular year George III went to his ancestors at Windsor, and
a plot to blow up the Cabinet, the Cato Street Conspiracy, was foiled.
But two very different, yet sadly almost forgotten events, the so-called
Radical Revolt and the Persecution of Queen Caroline, grabbed the
attention of the Scottish public.
Although the Cato Street Conspiracy, an ''armed and desperate scheme''
to overthrow authority and establish a republican government failed, it
reflected a feeling of discontent throughout the United Kingdom,
particularly in the poorer industrial areas.
On April 1, 1820, in Glasgow, Paisley, and surrounding villages
posters appeared calling on folk to rise and effect a reform of
government by force if necessary. An immediate strike was also called
for and this does appear to have met with some success, 60,000 workers
withdrawing their labour for a week. On the other hand, the rising
itself has been described by historians Donnachie and Hewitt as ''a
pathetic and misconceived escapade -- the result of false information
and poor leadership''.
On April 25 a party of about 50 radicals, mainly weavers, armed with
pikes and muskets, marched from Glasgow. It appears they were told they
would be joining a force several thousand strong in seizing the Carron
Iron Works with its stock of artillery.
However, the authorities soon got word of the march and a party of the
10th Hussars and the Stirlingshire Yeomanry overtook the insurgents at
Bonnybridge. The radicals found a position behind a wall, fired off a
few shots but were quickly overwhelmed by the cavalry. Nineteen men were
taken prisoner. A handful were injured. The battle -- or rout -- of
Bonnybridge was over.
In a separate but equally unsuccessful ''rising'' weavers from
Strathaven in Lanarkshire marched northwards towards Glasgow to team up
with other radicals. As they went they entered houses along the way,
according to the indictment, and carried off firearms by force and
intimidation.
Andrew Hardie, a Glasgow weaver, John Baird, a Condorrat blacksmith,
and James Wilson, also a weaver, from Strathaven, were hanged. Nineteen
men were transported to Botany Bay and after being pardoned in 1835 went
on to help shape New South Wales, clearly men of principle.
But what of the hounding of poor Queen Caroline, whose name does not
spring immediately to mind in a century so completely dominated by
Victoria? Here we have a drama every bit as juicy, intriguing, and, it
has to be said, newsy, as any of the shenanigans of our present royal
family. Watch this space.

Veterinary science has changed a lot since James Herriot first
traipsed the Yorkshire Dales. Ninian Dunnett talks to three modern
practitioners.
FULL of enthusiasm for ''country air, country people, country ways'',
the well-scrubbed young vet in the coffee advert sets off to his first
job. And, of course, this abiding romantic myth comes to us from Alf
Wight, the Scottish writer who remains the world's most famous vet in
his print and screen incarnation as James Herriot.
But increasingly Scotland's 300 veterinary practices are more likely
to resemble Abervet, on the south side of Aberdeen; urban in
surroundings, handling nothing bigger than a dog, and bristling with
hi-tech medical machinery. Veterinary medicine in Scotland is in fact
party the result of a reaction against the Herriot industry's
sentimental enthusiasms.
Many more women now train to be vets, and the field encourages
increased specialisation, but something has been lost. There is no
shortage of vacancies in veterinary practice around the country.
Started by 49-year-old David Wilson 10 years ago, Abervet employs
three veterinary nurses, receptionists, and a book-keeper in addition to
its three vets. The surgery boasts its own operating theatre, X-ray, ECG
and other scanning machines and equipment which can analyse blood
samples in minutes.
D W: ''Before I started here I was in a minority in a mixed practice;
one small-animal vet with three large-animal vets -- and I had some
differences of opinion with the others. Large-animal practice is purely
dictated by economics; if a cow is not economical to treat, it doesn't
get treated.
''But I do hysterectomies on hamsters. Actually we do quite a lot of
little furry animals, because there's not that many people interested in
them. I had hundreds of rabbits and guinea pigs and things as a boy and
people don't realise how significant things like rats or ferrets are to
children.
''So I've made a bit of a speciality of that. Mice are much more
difficult to anesthetise than people -- if you want them to wake up
again -- but the surgery can be very rewarding, with special small
surgical tools.
''I spent a lot of time as a child on an uncle's farm, and in the
past, most vets were either sons of vets or sons of farmers. But there's
not many of those now. The emphasis on academic standards for entry to
the training is influencing the type of people who are becoming vets.
When somebody comes here for a job, I'll say: 'Do you have a dog? Do you
ride?' And quite a few have absolutely no experience with animals, how
they think and how they behave.''
Julia Mitchell, 24, joined the practice on graduating 18 months ago.
J M: ''Looking back, compared to what life's like now, it was absolute
hell when I started here. You get taught everything in theory and
suddenly you have 10 minutes with that dog you know nothing about. It
took me about six months to actually get happy with it.
''But, in fact, so many people get fed up with this sort of work
because in a lot of it the dog walks in and before the owner opens his
mouth you know what it's going to be. But a few times a week you'll get
the really good cases -- thyroid problems and endocrinal things, and I
also like dermatology and some of the cardiology.
''You do have long-term cases you get very attached to. And I find it
very hard if it comes to the time you have to put them to sleep. I
generally get one of our nurses to help with the owners. It's the
hardest decision they'll ever make, and a lot of people feel they've
killed their pet.
''But it alters the way you think. If you can put an animal out of its
misery, and let it go with dignity, why can't we do it with humans? I
always say to my mum: 'Oh I'll put you down, you won't have to suffer .
. . ' It's a standing family joke. 'You'll be no trouble to me!'
''People can spend hundreds of pounds easily on long-term cases. We
had a dog hospitalised for a week recently, and the bill for that was
nearly #1000, though fortunately the owner was insured. And you do get
people who are hypochondriacs for their dogs. A lot of sick dogs, it's
actually the owner's problem -- but generally they don't want to see the
young thing, they'd rather see the person they think of as God (my
boss), so that's all right.''
Originally from Ayrshire, Patricia Wood is 45.
P W: ''I suppose I was a stereotype of somebody who wants to work with
animals. My parents had a place with five or six acres, and a few cattle
and a horse and dogs and chickens. I started at Glasgow University, then
I got married to a vet, and I've always worked part-time.
''Small animals are now done on an appointments system and there's
quite a lot of women do that. You have full-time nurses and
receptionists with you all the time, and you're not like the rural vet
out in his car making house calls.
''It wouldn't really work with my husband's job, if I was full-time as
well -- we'd hardly see each other.''

Music and theatre he could relate to but pictures meant nothing --
until he found Aboriginal art. Now he has a whole collection, as Clare
Henry discovers.
ONE day in November, 1988, in New York, a friend took Donald Kahn to
see an exhibition, Dreamings: The art of Aboriginal Australia. Kahn was
by no means a keen gallery-goer. ''Theatre, yes, since I was a little
boy, courtesy of my parents. Growing up in New York there was always
plenty of that. I discovered music at university and I like opera -- but
pictures? No, I'd never had an interest.'' But when he came upon the
Aboriginal show it had a profound effect.
''I saw the exhibition three times. The paintings were extraordinary.
Very, very beautiful. They impressed me to a degree I had never
experienced. Their most prominent characteristic was utter conviction.''
On his last visit he made his decision. ''I wanted to get some for
myself; their quality was so out of proportion to their price. Mine
might not be in the same league as those in that museum show, but I'd
try.''
He also decided then and there to build a collection that would tour
key venues world-wide. ''At first it felt a bit like taking on an
ambition to become an astronaut. But I went ahead and did it.''
Kahn's wife Jeanne is equally passionate about the paintings. ''The
minute we saw them, we knew they were important. Even if you didn't know
much about painting, you sensed that. We quickly discovered how to
winkle out what I call 'decorator' Aboriginal art. We learned fast.''
They began straight away by buying from New York's Tambaran Gallery
where Kahn found his first five pictures by the Western Desert artists
Pansy Napangati, Sonda Nampijinpa, Brogus Tjapangati, Ronnie
Tjampitjinpa and Frank Tjapangati.
The modern Aboriginal movement began in 1971 when a young Australian
teacher encouraged elders of the Papunya community in Australia's
Northern Territory to paint traditional subjects on canvas or board
rather than, as through the ages, on large natural surfaces such as rock
faces, the ground, or the human body.
The work of these desert artists can be seen as a kind of symbolic
landscape painting recording the Tjukurrpa or ''dreamings'' of ancestors
who travelled the land long ago. The dot patterns which make up the
pictures constitute the topography or iconography of a 50,000-year-old
Aboriginal tribal philosophy.
Kahn admits Pansy's five-foot acrylic, Kungka Kutjarra in Winpirri
1988, is his all-time favourite. Its star-spangled subtle blue brown
pattern of dots depicts designs associated with the Winpirri rock hole
far north-west of Alice Springs. The women are shown as U shapes; the
central roundel is the rock hole with the jagged lines depicting water
running down. Sinuous red lines represent surrounding sandhills while
the bursts of yellow stand for spinifex grass, in flower after the rain.
''It's all very marvellous. She's a great painter; bred in the bone.''
Strangely, in such a macho society, women artists have come to the
fore in a spectacular way, often in old age. Emily Kngwarreye, now 80,
started painting only 10 years ago. Louise Napaljarri Lawson, now in her
late sixties, is the senior woman at Lajamanu, and an important figure
in ceremonial life there. Women generally have only been painting as
artists in their own right since the early 1980s, but Pansy began in
Papunya in 1970, learning by watching older artists such as Johnny
Tjupurrula. ''My own interpretation of the matter,'' says Kahn, ''is
that once the Aboriginals began to work on board or canvas instead of
rocks, sand mosaics or body decoration; as soon as it was down to
individual effort and did not depend on group dynamics -- that was a
liberating influence for women. They can do their own thing and avoid
the male-dominated rituals and ceremonies.''
In London they sought out the main Australian art dealer and so met
Rebecca Hossack, now ''a close friend; a great pal. I was anxious to get
a painting by the major figure of the Western Desert, Johnny Warrangula,
whose work had so impressed me in the very first exhibition, and by a
marvellous coincidence she had received a letter the day before offering
a key work. Thus Kahn bought a pale concentric-circle concoction titled
Water Dreaming 1988, plus eight other pictures including work by Emily
and Louise.
But his main clutch of works came from a trip to Australia six months
after the project started. Ironically, it began badly. ''I arrived in
Sydney full of enthusiasm but, to my dismay, didn't see anything I liked
in the private galleries. I began to think my fascination for Western
Desert painting was a mistake.''
He was on the point of abandoining the search. ''I had travelled
10,000 miles only to find it had lost its magic.''
A last-minute contact, a German artist recommended by family friends,
saved the day. He put Kahn in touch with Felicity Wright, arts adviser
in Yuendumu, north of Alice Springs, who was taking paintings to exhibit
in Melbourne. Kahn flew immediately to Alice Springs to preview the
show. There in Wright's hotel room, with pictures unrolled across the
floor, he bought another 13 works, eight by women artists. He also
witnessed a sand-painting ceremony where a group of men created a
landscape covering 10 x 20 yards with earth, charcoal, and bird down.
''They sang and danced the story into being but when finished, the work
was gone. That's part of the ceremony.''
Kahn then travelled to Melbourne, Adelaide, and back to Sydney where
Norbett Knwerraye's magnificent 16ft-long painting, Five Stories, was so
large it had to be unrolled on the pavement for viewing.
For someone who had no previous history of collecting, Kahn has done
well, amassing what museum experts and gallery directors call ''a bloody
good collection of top quality; the best stuff by key artists''. The
collection has already toured to the Lowe Art Museum, Miami; Museum
Villa Stuck, Munich; Carolino Museum, Salzburg, plus museums in Tel
Aviv, Prague, and Warsaw.
Millionaire Kahn, who was in the publishing business before designing
computer systems and now ''watches his investments'', currently lives
between London and Salzburg. What will happen to the painting after the
tour?  ''We don't think it will ever finish. Aboriginal painting never
gets out of date; never goes out of style!''
At home in Salzburg they have pictures by the Austrian Paul Flora and
in the London flat just one Aboriginal work, by the best-known artist
Clifford Possum, who was received at Buckingham Palace on the occasion
of his 1990 London Hossack Gallery show. ''I also have a pair of white
tennis shoes that Clifford dotted up and gave me! He's a great fella.
I'm going to frame those shoes!''
The collection is now complete, Kahn says. With 34 paintings, it's of
a size to tour, yet gives an overview of Western Desert painting. So why
did he do it? ''The quality of the work speaks for itself. And showing
your collection in important museums and galleries is quite a thrill. A
lot of very wonderful things have happened; things that stem from the
collection. And I wanted to make a little mark by collecting something
excellent and allowing people to see it.''
* Kahn's collection can be seen at Edinburgh's Fruitmarket Gallery
until January 28.

Every pursuit needs a good foundation, and cooking is no exception.
Catherine Brown and illustrator Fiona Taylor get right back to basics.
I FIRST learned about stocks at Ross Hall Scottish Hotel School. The
foundations of cookery -- fonds de cuisine -- were simmered and stewed
for days in huge pots with tons of bones and vegetables and a tap at the
bottom to draw off the stock. Our catering lecturer, the late Ted
Renolds, joint author of The Chef's Compendium (1963), used to talk of
them giving ''body'' as well as flavour to everything we cooked.
Renolds, needless to say, was a perfectionist. The relentless accuracy
of his palate always sussed out those who had taken a short-cut.
''What did you use for stock?'' he would growl. ''This tastes like tap
water!'' For him, careful building on sound foundations revolved around
a system which started with a good stock. Fonds de cuisine were not a
dumping ground for leftover kitchen scraps but carefully balanced
recipes, made from fresh bones and vegetables with appropriate herbal
seasonings. For consommes there would be even more care and elaborate
clarifying with whites of eggs.
While this is fine if you cook for a living in a restaurant, the home
cook must readjust the catering concept of fonds de cuisine. Reach for a
stock cube? Get out the largest pot in the house and fill it with bones,
meat, and vegetables for a simple Scottish broth? Or hunt out some other
ingredients and methods which will give both body and flavour to soups
and sauces more simply and speedily?
Renolds was a hero who will be remembered for his distinguished
palate, attention to detail and kindly character beneath a gruff
exterior, but he belonged to an era of slavish attention to French haute
cuisine. The cooking world has become more eclectic. Cooking explorers
have gone in search of other means of achieving perfection and the
French no longer have the monopoly.
Concentrated savoury extracts to reinforce the flavour of foods which
are used in the East are based mainly on soy beans and fish. Pungent
South-east Asian fish pastes are difficult to find in Western shops but
miso is more available. Of Japanese origin, it is an ancient method of
salting and fermenting soy beans with a special mould and a grain such
as rice barley or wheat, then ageing the resulting paste for several
years.
Each region has its own traditional type of miso, ranging in colour
from light cream to tawny brown to deep chocolate. The flavour varies
according to the type of grain, but it should have a wine-like pungency.
Some versions are thick and smooth, while others are more chunky.
Nutritional yeast extract, not the same as baker's yeast, is a more
modern concentrated flavouring -- developed by nineteenth-century
scientists Pasteur and Liebig, it is now made in a variety of commercial
forms.
MISO VEGETABLE SOUP
Ingredients to serve 6-8:
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
Half a head of celery, plus leaves, finely chopped
8 oz (250 g) mushrooms
3 carrots, diced
1 tin chopped tomatoes
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
2 oz (50 g) brown rice
2 oz (50 g) bulgur wheat
1 tin cooked beans
Salt and freshly ground white pepper
Cold water to cover
2 tablespoons dried herbs: basil, tarragon, oregano or summer savoury
1 heaped tablespoon Japanese miso
Method: Heat the oil in a large pan and add the onions. Cook until
lightly browned. Add celery, mushrooms, carrots, and toss in the oil for
a few minutes. Cover and leave cooking over a very low heat for a few
minutes, stir again and add tomatoes, yeast, soy sauce, rice, bulgur,
beans, salt and pepper and herbs. Cover with water and bring to the
boil. Simmer until the rice and vegetables are cooked. Add the herbs.
Remove some of the soup to a bowl and mix with the miso to a runny
paste.
Pour into the soup, adjust seasoning and serve.
ARABIC LENTIL AND CUMIN SOUP
Ingredients to serve 4-6:
12 oz (400 g) green or brown lentils
6 pints (3 litres) water
4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 onions, finely chopped
1-2 teaspoons ground cumin (or cinnamon)
Freshly ground black pepper, about half a teaspoonful
Salt to taste
Method: Wash the lentils and put into a large pot. Add the water and
bring to the boil. Meanwhile heat the oil in a large frying pan and add
the onions. Cook until lightly browned, stir in the cumin (cinnamon),
salt and pepper. When the lentils are soft, remove from the heat and
puree in blender. Return to the pan and add the onion seasoning. Adjust
the consistency. It should be fairly thick. Simmer for 10 minutes and
serve hot or cold with toasted pitta bread.
CARROT AND BACON (MICROWAVE/PROCESSOR SOUP)
Ingredients to serve 4-6:
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
3 oz (75 g) streaky bacon, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 lb (500 ml) carrots (or other root vegetables)
1 cup (8 fl oz/250 ml) water
Milk to adjust consistency
Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste
1 ripe avocado pear
Method: Put the onion, bacon, and oil into a large bowl, cover and
microwave on high for six minutes. Remove and add the carrots
(vegetables) and water. Cover and microwave on high for another 10
minutes, or until the carrots are soft. Puree in blender. Adjust the
consistency with milk. Serve with finely chopped avocado.

Turn the other cheek to those winter blues and early-morning greys --
Jean Donald explains how the old ways are the best.
THE festive season is long past now, but you're still feeling the
after-effects -- which, if you're not careful, can seem to drag on to
the spring. You managed only a few hours' sleep last night, your skin
feels tight, your mouth is dry, and you've an hour before you leave for
work. But don't depair.
Mary Queen of Scots was hooked on red wine as a facial tonic but there
are traditional remedies that go back even further -- a bath laced with
a few drops of frankincense oil has proven therapeutic effects on an
overtaxed system.
It also has a soothing and elevating effect on the mind. Both
frankincense and myrrh are distilled from the resin of shrubs grown in
the Middle East, are best known for having been the very first
Christmas-time gifts, and are widely used both in medicine and in the
world of cosmetics.
Frankincense was worth more than gold to the early Egyptian, but now
it is available at more realistic prices, around #5.30 for an organic
variety for instance. The woody, spicy oil can also be used as a room
fragrance if mixed with a little water in a bowl.
Geranium, pine, orange, and mandarin oils are also known for their
enlivening effect on the body -- and the mind. Aromatherapist Maggie
Tisserand suggests a bath topped up with rosemary, juniper, and fennel
oil if you are suffering from a hangover rather than tiredness.
If you can bear it, cold water, even just on the feet, will get the
circulation going though the Tisserand remedy of a body scrub made from
20 drops of rose oil, 5ml of ojoba, and 50ml of almond oil sound more
attractive.
A splash of rose water or mineral water sprayed on the face is far
more gentle than tap water. You can add lavender oil and geranium, 10
drops of oil to 50 ml of water, to the water to make it more of a
treatment.
Dehydyrated complexions are well catered for by cosmetic companies. No
7's new Replenishing Serum, #12.50 for 50 capsules, should keep you
going over the party season and Clarins' Beauty Flash Balm, #15, is a
failsafe morning pick-me-up. Finally, keep make-up simple, and make sure
you apply it on cool, slightly damp skin -- hold a cool damp flannel
against your skin for a minute if need be.
* FRANKINCENSE oil is available from good health shops including
Quality Deli and Health Foods in Douglas Street and the Kelvin Pharmacy
in Hyndland Road, both in Glasgow. Mail order from Aroma-Therapy
Supplies, 52, St Aubyn's Road, Fishersgate, Brighton BN4 1PE (tel
0273-412139).

BREAKFAST may never be the same again. Philips, the domestic appliance
manufacturer, and Alessi, the Italian family firm renowned for top
design, have collaborated on an innovative set of kitchen appliances.
The citrus press, coffee-maker, toaster, and kettle make up a friendly
family of gadgets that will make the kitchen an altogether happier
place. In dramatic new shapes and colours, the Philips-Alessi range may
well set a trend for other appliance makers to follow.
The Philips-Alessi juice extractor best shows the combination of
styling and technology, and attention to detail. The juicer's unique
pressing system uses an 80-watt motor, which means you can get through
oranges effortlessly and quietly -- quite a consideration if you are
hungover or have light sleepers in the family. The stainless steel spout
can also be closed off so that it won't drip juice on the table top.
The kettle has come a long way: from the burnished copper on the range
in ''below stairs'' kitchens to shiny stainless steel on fifties
Formica. The microchip and new heat-resistant plastics changed the look
of kettles forever in the eighties with the upright jug kettle that
dominates the market today.
Each piece in the Philips-Alessi range has a beautiful curved profile
with burgundy highlight, but the kettle's distressing shade of green may
take some getting used to.
''The kitchen used to be the heart and soul of home life,'' says
Stefano Marzano, senior director of Philips Corporate Design and
co-ordinator of the Philips-Alessi project. ''The trouble is, the
twentieth-century pursuit of efficiency and hygiene has turned the
kitchen into little more than an impersonal food factory. The
Philips-Alessi line is an attempt to bring back a more humane feel to
the kitchen, by providing tools which are not only efficient but which
also fit in with the age-old culture of cuisine and mealtime
socialisation.''
If the Philips-Alessi kitchen range has a fault it may be its vaguely
retro appearance -- not quite deco thirties, not quite streamlined
fifties. But at least in the coffee maker and kettle there is a touch of
post-modern wit. While the latter has the appearance of an eager
penguin, the former's two parts ''snuggle up to each other like cuddly
pets'', according to the manufacturer's blurb.
* The Philips-Alessi line is available through House of Fraser,
Buchanan Street, Glasgow: Nice House, Princes Square, Glasgow: InHouse,
Wilson Street, Glasgow, and Howe Street, Edinburgh. The kettle costs
#89.95; coffee maker #139.95; toaster #99.95; citrus press #79.95.

Kenneth Wright welcomes the trend towards pubs that make their own
beer
LONG experience of browsing and sluicing in the pubs of Germany has
made Mr Hoppy weel acquent with the national phenomenon of the Brauhaus,
or the pub that makes and sells its own beer on the premises. The beer
always tastes grand, and would taste better if such pubs weren't -- I
don't know why -- generally staffed and patronised by the sort of guys
and dolls who feel that the late Herr Schicklgruber was a much
misunderstood man, and that foreigners have a bit of a cheek coming over
there and drinking up all that good German ale.
It's a trend -- the in-house brewing, not the politics -- that Mr
Hoppy's been glad to see catching on in Scotland in the last year or
two, what with the Uisge Beatha in Kelvinbridge, the Physician and
Firkin in Dalkeith Road, Edinburgh, and most recently the Brewhouse in
John Street, Glasgow, formerly the John Street Jam bar and restaurant.
The Jam was a decent place in its upwardly-mobile heyday of around 1990,
but the failure of the Merchant City project to turn Glasgow's city
centre into left-bank Paris pulled it socially and commercially downhill
in recent years, and it's no bad thing to see something new have a try
on the old John Street church site.
First impressions of the Brewhouse are of an atmosphere more akin to
Glasgow 1975 than 1995, but that's not necessarily any bad thing in this
hungover decade of auld claes and parritch. Live rock and blues music of
the up-and-at-them style is a regular feature, which is not so
surprising in the context of the pub's shrine to the late Glasgow rocker
Alex Harvey. The in-house beers are all well worth trying, as well as
the good selection of guest ales, and one thing you can say about a
brewery pub is that you know where at least some of the beer came from.
Good luck to it.
And now, the winners of the Beers of All Nations prize that we ran in
December. Worthy winners all -- if for nothing else, then for letting us
know just how much controversy and variety of opinion exists over the
identity of the oldest pub in Glasgow -- are Edward ''Big Drouth'' Burns
of Muirpark Street, Elliot Crowe of Newton Mearns, and John Macdonald of
Hillhead. I don't know whether any of your nine different nominations is
the right one, but 10 out of 10 for imaginative speculation. Each of you
will shortly be receiving a World Beer Gift Case from Christopher
Columbus Ltd, containing 10 bottled ales of wildly varying styles and
strengths: don't try to drink them all in the one night.

Conrad Wilson serves up the flavour of an Italian restaurant guide.
WHEN visiting France, people whose priorities are wine and food
invariably arm themselves with Michelin, Gault-Millau, or one of the
other established bibles of the gut. But what of Italy?
The assumption is that the only guides worth buying -- if, with luck,
you have heard of them -- are those edited each year by the venerable
Luigi Veronelli, much admired by traditionalists for their accurate
information and sturdy bindings (the 1995 diptych, just out, is the
first to be published in paperback). Veronelli's supremacy, however, has
recently been challenged by so many other guides that it is hard to
decide which of them to stuff into a shoulder-bag.
Regular usage has convinced me that the annual Gambero Rosso (or ''Red
Crayfish'') guide is the one to go for. It may be less detailed about
wine than Veronelli, but it certainly tells you which restaurants will
serve you an interesting well-priced bottle to accompany your
freshly-made ravioli with rabbit and wild mushrooms. Moreover it is
visually enticing, with information clear enough to be understood even
by people who don't read Italian. Its symbols are more user-friendly
than Michelin's, and -- this year -- more than 270 coloured maps
pinpoint the main restaurants, streets, and places of interest in each
town.
Complete with a natty little plus-or-minus quality/price register for
every restaurant (suggestive of a petrol gauge on the dashboard of a
car), this is a guide that is absolutely state-of-the-art, putting its
British equivalents to shame, and brilliantly enough devised to make
even Gault-Millau look to its laurels. Costing only 32,000 lire (about
#13) for almost 800 pages, it is wonderful value and the sooner a
British edition is printed the better. With a separate annual wine guide
published in conjunction with Slow Food Editore -- an Italian outfit I
praised in a previous column -- access is given to just about all we
need to know about the state of Italian gastronomy.
What Gambero Rosso doesn't mention are the types of virgin olive-oil a
restaurant uses, or the range of grappas available as digestivi. For
this kind of information you really must resort to the meticulous
Veronelli, whose fine detail is a lesson to the British guides -- or at
least to British restaurants whose choice of olive-oil might barely be
fit to name in print.
Yet a browse through Valvona &amp; Crolla's latest wine-list -- available
from its glorious Italian cavern at 19 Elm Row, Edinburgh -- provides a
reminder of the enormous range of Italian wines (and, indeed, olive-oils
and grappas) that can now be bought in Britain. Conspicuously absent (or
so it seems) are the products of the ''flying winemakers'' so popular
with Britain's supermarkets and high-street chains, but largely
irrelevant to Italy itself. There is more than enough in Valvona &amp;
Crolla's 31-page booklet to show what Italian wine is really like,
whether it be the 17 Barbarescos with which the list kicks off (at,
admittedly, premier-cru-claret prices) or the Selvapiana olive-oil (#79
for a generous five-litre can) with which, on page 29, it reaches its
gastronomic climax.
By any standards this is a stupendous list, particularly strong in the
#3.90 to #7 range, though some of Italy's dearer wines are experiences
worth spending a bit extra on.

Lesley Duncan hears the saga of one woman's efforts to bring the
Vikings to life.
WITH a surname like hers, Margaret Elphinstone sounds as if she has
stepped from the pages of The Lord of the Rings. There is nothing fey
about the novelist, organic gardener, and Strathclyde University
lecturer, though the writing on her blackboard may be as mysterious as
runes to undergraduates of this post-grammar era. ''Its only has an
apostrophe when it's it is,'' says the chalked message. Quite.
The last students of the afternoon have quit her eyrie, six floors up
in the Livingstone Tower. ''I find at the end of a teaching day I can
hardly talk,'' she says in her cheery English accent, ''which is agony
for me because I talk a lot!'' She submits good-naturedly to quizzing
about her new book, Islanders, recently published by Polygon.
Islanders deals with the life of Viking settlers on twelfth-century
Fair Isle. It is a tour de force in its imaginative projection into the
past. The transitional period when Christianity has almost ousted the
old Norse gods and the Vikings are forsaking pillage for agriculture
has, of course, already attracted the Orcadian master George Mackay
Brown. He sees with the eye of the poet; Margaret Elphinstone with a
perhaps more practical perspective.
Her teenage heroine, Astrid -- sole survivor of a shipwrecked vessel
fleeing the sacking of Dyflin (Dublin) -- is the catalyst of a plot
sustained for more than 450 pages by idiosyncratic characters and
fastidiously researched historical and geographical detail.
Has Margaret Elphinstone had a long obsession with Vikings? ''Oh yes,
it goes back to the 70s,'' she explains, ''when I was working in
Shetland Library.'' Her background in English studies at Durham
University had also included ''a bit about Icelandic literature''.
There is a puzzling map at the start of the book. The land contours
look vaguely familiar but as though through an upside-down mirror.
Place-names such as Noreg, Groenland, Faereyjar, and Orkneyjar are half
recognisable. Could this be a Tolkien-style imaginary world? Not at all.
It's simply northern Europe and the north Atlantic seen from the
viewpoint of Vikings looking south.
Margaret Elphinstone is fascinated by the theme of the outsider. The
shipwrecked Astrid is viewed somewhat askance by the Fair Islanders. But
she is also presented as a spirited girl. She is by no means the only
woman of strong personality in the book. Is Margaret Elphinstone
pursuing a feminist agenda here? ''I think that's putting it too
overtly,'' she replies, adding that one of the things she hopes she has
shown is how men's lives and women's lives were in balance in the
community of twelfth-century Shetland and their different roles very
necessary to one another.
''One of the things I've noticed about Viking myth is how male it
is,'' she says, both in terms of Shetland itself and from the point of
view of people further south where the Vikings were seen as pirates and
raiders who sacked monasteries: ''It's always men who do that.'' In fact
the Norse communities back home were 50% women: ''You don't hear much
about them.''
She points out that in some ways Norse society was less rigid than,
say, feudal England, and that women could play a part, though not an
official one. Women didn't go to the Thing -- the Norse community's
meeting place cum parliament. The women in Islanders ''don't have
official power but they have a lot to do with how things happen''.
Is this not entering the realm of how things ought to have been rather
than were? Elphinstone is quick to reply: ''I hope not. The sagas are
full of powerful and extremely daunting women.'' She cites the vengeful
Bergthora of the Njal Saga and four-times married Gudrun of the Laxdaela
Saga who confesses on her deathbed to treating ''him worst whom I loved
the best''.
The Vikings have Elphinstone firmly in their grip. Her next novel will
pursue them further back -- to the tenth century and the Vinland
voyages. It will be narrated by a woman. Elphinstone herself was in
Newfoundland and Labrador last summer exploring sites described in the
Vinland sagas. This coming summer she will visit Greenland and revisit
Iceland. ''It's really important for me to go to places that my books
are about.''
There are two books which she is deliberately not reading meanwhile --
George Mackay Brown's Vinland (though the New World section of it is
surprisingly brief) and a book about Eric the Red's daughter. On the
other hand she is philosophical about writing in a popular area: ''Think
how many novels there are about Mary Queen of Scots -- to which I shall
not add!''
Margaret Elphinstone's two earlier novels have been classified as ''a
kind of fantasy''. But her first book (co-written) was not fiction at
all but about organic gardening. It was penned in Galloway where she was
working as a jobbing gardener. With Scottish ancestry on her father's
side and ''a lot of my mother's background Jewish'', she was brought up
in the south and west of England, and has understandably ''quite a
complicated notion of nationality and belonging''. Be that as it may,
she has opted for life in North Britain. A recent move from Edinburgh to
Ayrshire has given her the pleasure of a garden of her own again and
Culzean down the road.
Islanders by Margaret Elphinstone is published by Polygon as a
paperback original at #9.99.

SOME cite the bawdy prose of Boswell as Scotland's sexiest body of
work. But the first and -- tragically -- last novel by Sarah Munro
(1960-94) is bawdier than Boswell. Before Chips on my Shoulder is
posthumously published I, courtesy of Black Dog Press, can quote from it
exclusively in The Herald.
Chips on my Shoulder opens by introducing the author: ''I'm not going
to go on about having a hard life and therefore having had to do what I
had to do. I grew up in Glasgow, which has a hard reputation but soft
touches. I was not exactly hard up. My father owned a chip shop so my
mother had money to tart herself up and my father loved it. Loved her
tarty outfits more than her as I did. I used to totter about in her high
heels before I even came up to her stocking tops.''
Sarah attended a girls' school in Glasgow. ''It was,'' she says in
Chips on my Shoulder, ''a school for scandal for Catholic girls who felt
hellish most of the time. We were threatened with hellfire for sins we
could hardly conceive of committing. We were told of the menace of men.
By the time I left school, at 16, the only men I knew were my father and
my father's customers in the shop and I did not feel menaced. When I
helped out in the chip shop, the male customers were polite, even when
drunk. 'A fish supper, darling,' they would croon in their melancholy
manner. Most of our customers were Catholics. They ate a lot of fish.''
After school, Sarah went to Glasgow University to read English and
found herself surrounded by Scots: ''I was, though I say it myself, a
good-looking girl. I had long bottle-blonde hair and a figure fine
enough to turn heads and raise temperatures.''
For reasons given in the novel, she dropped out and turned on to drugs
and drink and prostitution. She made a lot of money from a lot of men as
she explains in Chips on my Shoulder. I cannot quote the most revealing
passages in a family newspaper but, believe me, the erotic prose is
astonishing.
Readers will enjoy the orgasmic moments as much as Sarah did once upon
a time. Alas, Sarah's orgasmic moments were increasingly ticked off by
the time she took over drink and drugs. She tried being treated for
depression but the treatment distressed her. For better or worse she
decided to end it all, including her novel, by taking more drink and
more drugs.
As her remarkable novel ends on a suicidal note I give her the last
word: ''I have the bottle of pills in front of me as I write this. And
the bottle of booze. This is no cry for help. I'm beyond help. I don't
care who finds these words, don't care what they do with them. I don't
care about tomorrow. Tonight is my last night. This, at last, is the
end.''

Peter Haining (ed.) A SHERLOCK HOLMES COMPENDIUM (Warner, #6.99).
* THIS delightful collection of Sherlockiana is proof positive
(Watson) that the idea of the greatest detective of all the ages being
merely a fictional character is a canard, believed only by the canaille.
The distinguished assemblage of authors, games players, critics, and
academics who have contributed to this volume know for certain where he
was born, lived, and died, and, what is more, can prove it. There is an
essay by Franklin D Roosevelt, claiming Holmes as an American, a
spiffing story by P G Wodehouse explaining why Holmes was in fact
Moriarty, and the thoughts of Basil Rathbone on his meeting with Dr
Watson in Central Park, New York. There is even a leader from the Times
claiming that the great man never said: ''Elementary, my dear Watson''.
He did, many times, but never to the Times, or to that charlatan Arthur
Conan Doyle. For Holmes people, this is indispensible. For those yet to
be converted -- ''Education never ends, Watson''.
Gordon Legge. I LOVE ME (Who Do You Love?) (Polygon, #8.99)
* HAVING graduated through various combos like the punk rock outfit
Banana Vomit and Goth ensemble Essence of Hamburg, Deek is keen to get
out of the cabaret scene and back into a real band. Meanwhile, his peers
are dealing with life in a small Scottish satellite town the best way
they can, usually with the aid of jazz cigarettes and Special Brew.
Legge's second novel occupies the same terrain as The Shoe: the rigours
of ageing, out-of-touch families, and nowhere-slow McJobs are offset by
casual sex, football, and an endless chain of daydreams. Gentler than
contemporaries like Irvine Welsh, Legge's vision is Ealing-like in its
shoulder-shrugging wistfulness.
Edward Toman. DANCING IN LIMBO (Flamingo, #5.99).
*WHEN his Protestant newsletter goes the way of all flesh, Oliver
Cromwell McCoy revives a radio transmitter left over from the Titanic
and proceeds to preach the risen Lord to the people of Ulster. But his
enemy, Cardinal Schnozzle O'Shea, plans to go several better with an
evangelistic television chatshow to be hosted by the finest-looking
priest in Ireland, Frank Feely: the scene is set for a battle in which
the finer points of theology are as sounding brass and tinkling cymbal.
With a Waughian eye for cant, Toman details modern Ireland in all its
chameleonic hilarity.
Christopher Coe. SUCH TIMES (Penguin, #6.99).
* ''YOU smell of chlorine.'' As great romantic lines go, the first
words shared by Timothy and Jasper aren't exactly in the Now Voyager
stakes. The bath-houses of New York in the 1970s were not hotbeds of
sentimentality; they were, however, the breeding ground of a virus that,
20 years later, has killed Jasper and debilitated Dominic, Timothy's new
lover. A landmark in a wasteland, Timothy outlives and outloves his
partners, and reflects on how a generation defined by free love is now
defined by the price it has been forced to pay. Coe writes with numinous
elegance of his lost world and the emotional pile-ups caused by Aids.

John Wells. PRINCESS CARABOO: Her True Story (Pan, #4.99).
* THIS is a fascinating tale of duplicity and obsession, the duplicity
being that of Mary Baker and the obsession that of the author. In 1817 a
young girl wearing a turban was found wandering near Bristol. She
appeared to speak no known language, but through a series of
coincidences bolstered by her charm and allure, she was launched on
English society as Princess Caraboo, who had been captured by pirates in
what she called Javasu and had swum ashore when their ship was near
England. She was, in fact, just plain Mary Baker, a silver-tongued
vagrant whose own story is much more interesting than the fictitious
princess's. The author traces her life from birth to death, speculates
creatively on her motivation, and confesses to being half in love with
her himself. Not the book of the film by Michael Austin, but the true
story behind it.
Giovanni Verga. SHORT SICILIAN NOVELS (Dedalus, #6.99).
* REGARDED in Italy as their greatest writer next to Manzoni, Verga is
best known abroad for Mascagni's opera Cavalleria Rusticana and
Visconti's film La Terra Trema, although few could tell you the author
of their originals. These naturalistic tales from 1883 are an
understated depiction of peasant life reminiscent of Thomas Hardy:
underlying the stories is a social awareness of the tribulations of the
people, beleaguered by each other, natural forces, Church, and State,
but Verga allows the reader to provide the moral himself. This
translation by D H Lawrence is at times stilted, but the portrayal of
life's little ironies survives the bumpy journey intact.
Elizabeth Smart. ON THE SIDE OF THE ANGELS (Flamingo, #5.99).
* A FOOTNOTE to one entry in these journals serves as a loud warning
to the reader: ''Smart is using amphetamines for writing,'' it says.
''Much of what she writes under their influence is incomprehensible.''
This could apply to a fair proportion of her work, from the notebooks
she used as first drafts for fiction to her famous By Grand Central
Station I Sat Down and Wept, which laboriously describes her obsessive
love of the poet George Barker. While Smart's prose has flashes of
lyrical beauty, On The Side of the Angels details her personal demons
with such solipsistic intensity that it only occasionally rises above
the level of sixth-form swoonings; the result swings between the pompous
and the mundane.

Toyah Willcox has a new incarnation as Peter Pan. But she and David
Belcher are never-never going to hit it off as long as virtual reality
remains an obsession.
TANTRUMS in the nursery. Ungainly shouting. Little fists clenched
tight; little heels dug in. Attention-seeking histrionics. Stubborn and
senseless arm-waving.
I didn't want to, but I couldn't help it, honest. Some things seem to
float back to the surface of your mind no matter how hard you try to
stop them. And in this case all these things are accompanied by a shrill
and emblematic refrain. Aye, right enough, hen, it's a mysteree, it's a
mysteree . . .
And what is the source of this mystery? Me and my preconceptions about
the musico-thespian whirlwind that is Toyah Willcox. There we were, me
and Toyah grabbing a hurried lunchtime half-an-hour together last week
in the backstage canteen at Chichester's Festival Theatre, and I'm
trying desperately to forget. To be open-minded. To forgive.
Specifically, I'm trying to banish my shuddering memories of the
pre-pubertal musicality which characterised Toyah in her initial
incarnation, back in 1980. A diminutive figure with stiffened orange
hair, Toyah surfed truculently atop the new wave with such lumpy anthems
as It's A Mystery, I Want To Be Free, and Thunder In The Mountains.
What did she sound like? Overblown. Childish. Pesky. Distorted. As
welcome as chunder in the fountains. In fact, Toyah was like Kate Bush
with busted tone and volume controls. Yup, that bad.
Another of Toyah's songs was Be Loud, Be Proud (Be Heard). ''Be good''
never entered into it. Additionally, groaning cinema-goers wondered if
there was no start to Toyah's talents as she wandered, got up as a
malevolent punk sprite called Mad, through Derek Jarman's tatty ode to
the Sex Pistols, 1977 and all that, Jubilee.
To her credit, Toyah would like to forget this era, too. ''Every
newspaper headline about me still has 'punk-rocker' in it somewhere.
After 20 years.'' Yeah, right, bit of a liberty, I agree.
Like wow, if we were all pinned inescapably to our pasts circa 1980,
blimey, instead of being a lantern-jawed two-fisted news-buster, I'd be
a smudgy geezer with an ineffectual moustache, maroon acrylic waffle
jumper, devil-may-care pixie boots, and my mum's kitchen tablecloth
slung over my shoulders in a poor approximation of Spandau Ballet!
A truce is necessary. Yet having been declared, it lasts barely three
seconds. My fault. My ill-devised opening question is about Peter Pan,
the 90-year-old children's entertainment created by Forfarshire loon J M
Barrie, in the title role of which Toyah has trod the boards with
commendable gusto in Chichester for six weeks. Later this month, it
starts a short spell in Auld Reekie.
Not got a great theatrical heritage, Peter Pan, has it? Lulu's panto
footsteps are not lastingly deep ones . . .
''Oh yeah, Lulu. And Bonnie Langford,'' Toyah says, regarding me over
the top of her spectacles with steely contempt. ''But they were in the
Broadway version, the Mary Martin version. Ours is a new, very English
adaptation which is pure to the J M Barrie story. Margaret Lockwood,
Maggie Smith, Margaret Rutherford . . . they've all played Peter Pan.
''Peter Pan was first created in 1904 by the top theatricals, the
elite. It was the start of panto in a sense, but only because it was
such a technically-complex show that there were scene changes which took
30 minutes and so they brought on acrobats and jugglers to fill these
intervals.
''But we're not panto. There's no dame. There's no talking directly to
the audience. It's a children's drama, and you have to do it to the
utmost of your abilities because you are addressing theatre's potential
audience.''
Whoops. Got it all wrong. I apologise. Let's begin anew. At the start
-- who were your idols when you began performing? Actors or musicians?
Have you ever felt confusion about which field you want to be seen to be
in?
''My idols were Diana Rigg, Billie Whitelaw, plus Marc Bolan, Alice
Cooper, and David Bowie. I always wanted to sing, but found myself at
the National Theatre when I was 18, where I started music because there
were all these great musicians around me.
''But life should be challenges and what you enjoy rather than what
people think of you. Actor? Musician? Actor-musician? This is not my
problem. It's a media disease because the media has to categorise
people, and I need the media for what I do . . . but I work all the
time, touch wood.''
Yet how does it feel to have had chart success, and then not to have
it, no matter how good you feel yourself to be? To know that you can
work as hard at your music as you can and still to miss the moment,
which is what pop is about.
''You're putting your foot in it now,'' Toyah is scolding me
gleefully. ''I've been in the charts across the world in the past 12
months. In Germany. In Japan. On an indie level in America. My last LP,
Dreamchild, which was re-mixed by DJ Tim from Utah Saints, is on four
different indie labels.
''But yeah, moments come and go all the time. Radio 1 think you're too
old, or you don't fit their image. But it's not my problem. Why care if
someone likes what you do or they don't? Either you're working from the
heart or you're trying to impress someone else.
''If it's from the heart, success doesn't come into it.''
Record company definitions of success are anathema to Toyah. ''I got
fed up being signed to majors who wanted me to be the latest thing . . .
whatever it was that was in the charts at the time. In 1985 I remember
CBS wanting me to be like Tracey Ullman. Most incongruous. At 26, I was
under pressure about my looks, my weight, what designers I wore . . .
'What's this got to do with the music?' I asked them.
''I got into music for expression. Because I liked singing. Not to be
in the charts. These days I can sell a guaranteed number of LPs, maybe
20,000. Sell 10,000 and you've covered your costs; anything more is
profit.
It's become a cottage industry. I do it. Fish does it. My husband does
it.
''Soon we'll be selling LPs on Internet, using CD-ROM. We send it down
the line, and you get a DAT/CD-quality recording that you pay for by
credit card.''
Mention of new technology leads us to workaholic Toyah's thrusting,
now-a-go-go life as a film producer, with five projects at various
stages of development . . . and all of a sudden she lets slip the one
phrase I am unable to take at face-value: virtual reality.
Whenever I hear these words -- virtual reality -- all I can think of
is actual untruth. Yes, I know: I am meant to join the rest of the
twenty-first century in hailing virtual reality as a triumph of the
cyber-space info-tainment highway . . . but virtual reality just means
obvious fib.
So OK, theatre's a fib, too. But at least folk get to choose whether
or not to believe in the stuff they see in the theatre, or suspend their
disbelief about it. Whereas yon virtual-reality stuff, with its
mind-invading technology, actively seeks to enmesh us in its bogus web,
forcing us to participate in it. Doesn't it? Maybe. Or am I a Luddite
fuddy-duddy technophobe, cleaving pointlessly to the outmoded? Possibly.
Not that Toyah has any such doubts or fears. About anything. No time
for it. Jings, Toyah's only got time for one band now, the Toyah Band,
where there used to be three at once. There was Kiss of Reality, who
were jazz, and there was Sunday All Over The World, which Toyah did with
her husband, chronic guitar-noodler Robert Fripp, creator of ambient
sound for four decades. In 1995 she can only spare a bit of time in the
summer for a few live gigs.
Toyah and her husband are so busy, in fact, that their marriage
remains a fleeting, long-distance one. Home for both partners is
Salisbury in Wiltshire, although Fripp is most often in the US,
currently assisting at the birth of a King Crimson album. Wiltshire is
where Toyah most often is, when she's not touring the UK as a stage
actor, or doing TV, or some gigging.
And all the time she's not on stage or TV Toyah will be fielding
calls, giving good phone as you must in the filmbiz. She leapt pell-mell
into movie-making last summer, forming British American Productions with
Paul Springer, whose CV includes Star Wars and whom Toyah had met when
being a dog in The Ink Thief for children's telly.
There are two regular BAP films in pre-production: Toyah is executive
producer of File Under Deceased, starring Lysette Anthony; she is
co-producing Sigusa, to be directed by Alex Cox. And then there are the
three other BAP movie projects which lead us back to the complete
fabrication which is . . . virtual reality.
Toyah is cagey about two of her VR projects, one of which she will
direct. ''BT is developing an interactive TV channel, and they have
approached us and Peter Gabriel to develop some ideas. But it's a
highly-competitive world.''
What Toyah can mention is Travelling Light. ''Sony have given us #3m
to film it. It's a -- what's the word? It's a synergy . . . 40% music
and 60% action. I'm executive producer and one of the stars. There's me,
and Sam Fox, and Yazz. We're the main characters.''
Sam Fox? The Sam Fox? The born-again booby-babe? Yazz? The
stratospheric shrieker with a rude noise for a name? I utter neither of
these damning statements, instead smiling a glassy smile, trying and
evidently failing to look polite, and Toyah is regarding me frostily
over her spectacles again, and I realise that we are back almost where
we began, in inhospitable territory.
Hey-ho. Me and my blinkered preconceptions. Maybe I should face some
facts about my own critical limitations, realising that the curmudegeon
who will not allow change in others has his eyes bound with a
virtual-reality representation of his mum's kitchen tablecloth.
So, er, as you played Mad in Jubilee and Monkey in Quadrophenia, what
character's name would best sum up Toyah Wilcox?
''Schizo. Although my husband calls me Petite Cheval.''
Oh aye . . . petite what?
''Little Horse.''
Toyah Wilcox, little horse. In fashion; out of fashion; always
devising a demand for herself. My Little Pony, gone but not forgotten.
Public approbation is indeed a mystery.
Peter Pan, starring Toyah Willcox and Frank Finlay as a palpably
decent Captain Hook, begins its five-day, eight-performance run at
Edinburgh's Festival Theatre on Tuesday, January 24.

THE ornamental border had an important role in Victorian design. Used
in carpets, mosaic floors, furniture, soft furnishings and sometimes
even clothing, the decorative border drew its design elements from
classical sources -- particularly architectural and geometric. Bands of
stylised flowers, leaves and other botanical specimens were also
popular.
No longer an intrinsic part of an object, today's ornamental border is
presented as the finishing touch -- and, in some cases, a method for
creating an illusion. Whether you stencil it or buy it as tiles or a
wallpaper roll, the ornamental border can be used to advantage and for
many different effects.
Victorian homes, for example, often had hallway dados, sometimes wood,
sometimes heavily embossed paper, then painted and finished with a
wooden strip edging. The same dado effect can be recreated by decorating
your hallway with contrasting paint and paper: a dark, striped paper
below, with light paint above.
In between comes the ornamental paper border -- to add additional
decorative emphasis to the division. Move the decorative border further
up the wall and you can pretend you have a picture rail -- another
optical illusion which will bring down the height of a too-tall ceiling.
Use two borders -- one half way and the other at ceiling height -- to
really emphasise a patterned paper.
Bathrooms too have traditionally featured a tiled or wooden area
installed half-way up a wall and behind the bath, while kitchens were
often painted with a practical gloss on the lower half of the wall and
eggshell above.
The wide availability of decorative paper borders gives every home
owner the opportunity to not only recreate some of the Victorian
interiors but also to experiment. Decorative edgings can be used in many
different situations -- to recreate Georgian-style panels on a painted
wall; to decorate a folding screen; to outline an unusual architectural
feature or bedroom window; to edge a kitchen shelf; to liven up a
children's room; or as an added frame around a hanging mirror. The
applications are endless.
If you wish to give the illusion of architectural detail, then try one
of the ornamental paper borders sold by Laura Ashley. Available in a
variety of colours, including a Victorian-style dark green, this
''Architectural'' range features a vine winding around a column. They
are well teamed with a dark-striped paper for a hallway dado. Their
''Egg &amp; Dart'' border in stone, reminiscent of plasterwork, would add a
subtle architectural touch at ceiling height.
Laura Ashley also provides a selection of decorative paper borders for
children's rooms -- borders wide enough to give the feeling of a mural.
Choose from a country farm scene, the Owl &amp; Pussycat, the alphabet, a
circus or Noah's Ark and team up with co-ordinating paper. If you have
time to spend and want to try a stencilled border instead of one in
paper, then Laura Ashley can also provide with you the equipment for
these: they sell brass border stencils with shells, ducks, vines or
roses, plus a selection of paints.
Crown Wallcoverings also give you ample opportunity to provide that
finishing touch with ornamental borders. Their design of swimming
dolphins adds a real nautical touch to the bathroom while a colourful
border of fruits is well suited to the kitchen. Crown have decorative
paper borders especially for children's rooms -- including a bright
parade of hippos, crocodiles and lions and a selection of floral and
geometric edgings which can be co-ordinated with their papers.
The beauty of the decorative wallpaper border is that it is easily
applied -- giving maximum effect for little effort. What is more, it
gives the opportunity to link contrasting papers and paints and add
additional design.

For those who are in the market for converted agricultural buildings,
more grist to the mill is being offered by a Perthshire estate agent.
Bidwells is currently marketing three substantial properties which
have been carved out of a stone steading near Coupar Angus.
Wester Leys Steading benefits from a beautiful rural location on the
edge of the Sidlaw Hills and each unit has a courtyard set ting and
panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.
''Great care has been taken to retain original features of the
property,'' says Bruce Osborne of Bidwells. ''The former mill ring, for
example, now forms an impressive circular living room in the largest
dwelling.''
Each unit will be completed to a high standard of workmanship, with
particular attention being paid to stonework finishes.
Unit 1 has four bedrooms, Unit 2 has three bedrooms and Unit 3 has a
total of four bedrooms - two on the ground floor and two at first-floor
level.
Each unit is constructed principally of stone under a slate roof, and
each has an area of private garden and a garage.
The steading is set on the edge of the Hallyburton Estate, about three
miles south east of Coupar Angus. Dundee and Perth are within a half
hour's drive.
The area is on the edge of the Vale of Strathmore, with easy access to
woodland and hill walks in the Sidlaw Hills and the spectacular feature
of Lundie Craigs immediately to the east of the property.
Offers are invited from #110,000 for each dwelling.

KEEP warm this winter with furniture and fabrics inspired by the
American West. Natural fabrics and finishes are essential to the look,
with wool, cotton, and wood playing key roles. Colours should be muted
with the odd splash of primary tones.
Coarse textures, heavy-weight fabrics and solid furniture are very
effective and are available in a number of the larger chain stores'
collections. Habitat has a wide range of soft furnishings which are
ideal for the look.
In the lounge, the wool blanket stitch cushions (#20) combine grey
with red and navy. The Fort Worth gun tuft wool rug (#249) will add
warmth and texture to any room. Wool blankets -- in natural, navy, and
mustard -- have blanket stitch detail and add a cosy dimension to most
bedrooms. Rag rugs are economical and colourful. You can pay as little
as #4.90 for the Jeksen rug at Ikea.
Cotton gingham, particularly blue or red, goes perfectly with
patchwork. Marks and Spencer offer a wide range of bed linen which
complements the look perfectly. The blue and white gingham check range
is clean, crisp, and reasonably priced at #20 for a single duvet cover.
The collection of patchwork quilts (from around #95) are hand-made and
come in yellows and blues and pastel shades. The prairie range of
bedlinen is inspired by an American country look with a strong folk
influence. A bright and cheery print on a white background, the pattern
is also available in lamp shades and borders.
Designer bedlinen may sound an extravagance but, if you are looking
for something extra special, ''West'' by Chevignon of the French Linen
company was designed in France but captures traditional American style.
Native hearts and flowers are featured on a natural background on one
side and hearts on the other.
The bed linen is versatile and colourful with a double duvet cover
costing #89 and a pillowcase #19. Large pillowcases are also available.
Not just for the braves, ''Chiquito'' is inspired by the traditional
blankets of the American Indian, using a subtle combination of red,
brown and blue, on a natural background.
For the final luxurious touch, the ''Michigan'' robe, complete with
the Chevignon logo embroidered on the back of the ''Oregon'' patchwork
quilt style, is ideal for lazy Sunday mornings. The full range is
available at Frasers.
Bedroom furniture should incorporate simple shapes and natural
finishes if you decide to use the American West look. Ikea's Natura
bedroom range comes in lacquered grey and brown. It works well with
gingham or plain white. A bed frame costs #201 and a wardrobe #159.
Kitchen furniture is sturdy and basic. Scrubbed wooden tables which
double for food preparation and dining are an economical buy which
should last a lifetime. Ikea's Nostalgia collection comes in grey/brown
stain or natural spruce and is practical and affordable. The Nostalgia
kitchen table costs #358 with chairs at #63.
The American kitchen would not be complete without the smell of
freshly ground coffee. The Lakeland Plastics traditional cast-iron
grinder in the original Salter design can be adjusted for fine or coarse
coffee. The company also stock a wide selection of freshly roasted
coffee beans which you can keep in the refrigerator or freeze until
ready for use.
Look out for traditional white crockery. Habitat's white porcelain
range is simplicity itself. A 20-piece box set cost #65. A mug costs
just #3.50. Team with Marks and Spencer traditional stainless steel
cutlery set with the melamine handles (#35 for a 24-piece set). Look out
any traditional lace tablecloths you have, plain or embroidered. They
will complement the look perfectly.
Marks and Spencer's Cornelli table linen is made in 100% cotton and
hand-embellished. One tablecloth cost #38, and a set of four matching
napkins #15.

THE qualities associated with hardwoods -- solidity, warmth, quality
and craftsmanship -- lend themselves beautifully to the work of many
contemporary furniture designers and craftsmen.
''In terms of form, hardwood is strong wood which allows designers to
create more expressive designs and cleaner lines -- shapes can be
curvier and planes thinner,'' said a spokesman for Habitat. Its Holst
table in maple is the store's best-selling piece of hardwood furniture
and is handsome, functional and relatively inexpensive, while their
custom-made furniture in beech, cherry, and oak sell steadily at the top
end of the range.
If you are considering buying hardwood furniture but are concerned
about the environmental issues, it's well worth investigating the
sources of the wood. Terms like ''renewable sources'' and ''managed
sources'' could be virtually worthless, particularly when applied to
tropical hardwoods, so look for a company with credible and
well-developed policies on environmental issues. Designers and retailers
know that public concern about the environment plays a big part in the
market equation, so you should be able to find out where your purchase
has come from.
Habitat, for instance, is a founder member and co-signatory to the
World Wildlife Fund for Nature 1995 Group, which aims to phase out the
use of woods which don't come from well-managed forests by the end of
1995. Meanwhile, the company buys from accredited sources or uses timber
which is widely available from regions where forests are not in decline.
They also work with local experts and specialist organisations to put
the Forest Stewardship Council's Forest Management principles into
practice.
The American company Charleston Forge approaches the problem by using
only cherry wood and solid oak from well managed local sources in a
range of furniture encompassing dining room tables and chairs, kitchen
furniture and sumptuous occasional pieces. The wood is given a
distressed finish in the factory, and used with heavy, antiqued pewter
and wrought iron. The range is available in this country through
Lewis's. Their best seller is the Charleston Forge baker's rack, which
costs #595. Its solid construction and capacious shelving make it an
eminently practical piece of furniture, ideal for a spacious kitchen.
The Forest Stewardship Council is currently paving a pathway through
the minefield with its plan to certify timber from sustainable sources.
In the meantime, Friends of the Earth recommend asking questions. Is the
furniture made from tropical hardwoods and, if so, is the wood from a
plantation or from virgin forest? You may not always get satisfactory
answers, but at the very least, you remind your supplier of the public
concern surroundign the destruction of the rain forests. When in doubt,
try to stick to temperate hardwoods like maple, cherry, cedar, beech and
oak, and avoid tropical hardwoods, particularly Brazilian mahogany.
Hardwood furniture is incredibly strong and durable -- a good piece
should last for generations. Its inherent strength and versatility,
however, are not the only reasons for the increasing use of hardwood in
modern furniture manufacture. Fashions come and go, but a very broad
split developed some time ago between predictable pine and stark, trendy
metal. The end result was limited, tired and boring -- for designers and
consumers alike.
For an illustration of the way in which the inventive use of hardwood
can provide a stunning alternative, take a look at the ''River'' modular
storage collection available from Inhouse in Glasgow and Edinburgh. A
range of units built in curvy, rippling shapes from glass and beech
veneer, they are stained or painted in a range of colours. Like all the
best contemporary hardwood furniture, it manages to look exciting and
modern without sacrificing the pleasing warmth that comes with organic
shapes and materials.
The current interest in colourful and adventurous wood stains and
finishes may also have played a part in reviving interest in hardwoods.
The aforementioned Holst table, for instance, is available in natural,
blue or green finishes. ''Aesthetically, our customers are excited by
the range of colours and textures which the use of hardwood makes
possible'', said the Habitat spokesman.
Habitat are by no means the only ones to exploit the variety and
visual appeal of hardwoods. Grange's collections are made almost
exclusively in French and American cherry wood, for instance, but their
range of nine finishes, distinguished by the degree of waxing, polishing
and distressing involved and by natural variations in the colour of the
wood, makes for a varied collection. The company also produces the
''Shaker'' range in sycamore. Functional, well crafted and solid, these
pieces are pulled back from austerity by brightly coloured wood stains
and a beautifully deep, saffron stain on cornices and interiors.
Enjoy choosing and buying your hardwood furniture and remember that,
properly managed, the felling of hardwood timber need not be harmful to
the environment. In fact according, to Friends of the Earth, a revived
Scottish hardwood industry might be very good news for a country with
more than its fair share of gifted crafts people and neglected or
mismanaged land.
Any landed, principled entrepreneurs out there?

THERE was a time when few gardens would be without chrysanthemums of
one sort or another. Nowadays, you don't see many around, except perhaps
at show time.
For the life of me, I cannot understand why more chrysanths are not
grown. In addition to a magnificent show in the garden, they cut
beautifully and will outlast many others in the home. They keep my wife
happy.
It is true they can be a bit pernickety to grow, but nothing that
should tax a reasonably keen gardener. Take a lot of strain out of
things by buying young plants in February or March, or larger ones for
setting out in April.
The alternative is to overwinter what are called the chrysanth stools.
Use a cold frame or cold greenhouse. If you leave the plants out of
doors, they will either rot with the cold and damp, or the slugs will
gobble them up.
I grow early flowering chrysanths. Any time during January or
February, they will send out masses of new, fresh growth from the base
of the plant. You can root these with ease.
Take the small shoots at about 4-5in long. Remove the lower leaves.
Trim the cuttings below a node.
It is perhaps not a good idea to be too smart in taking cuttings
during January. The danger is you can end up with overlarge plants. For
most early flowering types, taking cuttings in February or March is soon
enough.
Root the cuttings round the edge of a pot, with a bit of warmth at a
convenient window sill. Ideally, use a propagating case or bench.
Cuttings may wilt a bit and look sorry for themselves but, provided
there is enough warmth, they will pick up.
Many gardeners use a rooting hormone, liquid or powder, though they
aren't really necessary. With a sandy compost that is well drained, the
cuttings should root naturally enough.
You will soon know when they ''take', as growth will freshen up. Then
is the time to remove the cuttings, and pot them up in 2-3in pots with a
good compost. Take care not to snap off the new roots.
From there it is a question of growing them on, very slowly, in a cool
atmosphere with sufficient moisture to keep them going. Aim to plant out
about mid-April.
While show enthusiasts have a precise programme of stopping and
selecting, you don't need to worry about anything like this with the
general range of spray varieties.
If plants get too leggy, nip out the growing point. This encourages
side shoots to grow. The bed for planting out should be well dug and
manured. They like nothing so much as well rotted manure, down below the
surface. It is also a good idea to add about 4-5oz per sqare yard of
base fertiliser.
Put plants about a foot apart each way. Use 5ft canes, immediately
they are set out, and tie plants loosely with soft twine.
That is all there is to it. Perhaps a bit of extra feeding now and
then. Possibly reduce them to three to five side shoots per plant.
I get mine from the well-known firm of Woolman's. Send or phone for
their colour catalogue and you will learn a lot about chrysanth growing.

WINTER months can mean waking up to streaming windows, wet walls, and
the musty smell of clothes being ruined inside damp wardrobes. You
cannot warm up the weather to dry the excess moisture which causes
condensation: you can, however, take some steps to reduce the problem in
your home.
The air in a house is usually warm enough to hold all the water, even
though we make so much of it by breathing, cooking, and using baths and
showers.
When the air temperature falls -- particularly at night during the
winter -- the air cannot hold so much water. The excess is deposited as
condensation on cold surfaces.
There is usually no single cause of condensation and no simple cure.
You may need to tackle air temperature, humidity, insulation and poor
ventilation to banish dampness. Altering your lifestyle can also work.
Here are some common symptoms of condensation, the causes and the cures:
* Symptom: Generally damp walls and windows. Cause: The room may
simply be too cold. If you raise the temperature it will dry out.
Sometimes householders cause the problem by turning off radiators in a
seldom-used room to save money. Cure: Taking the chill off the room
should work, but do not use an oil heater. They produce a lot of
moisture.
* Symptom: Damp and mould patches on the ceiling, with tell-tale lines
where the roof timbers lie. Cause: Condensation loves cold walls and
ceilings -- the lines on the ceiling are caused by the relatively warm
roof timbers. Cure: Insulate the loft, or tile the ceiling with
polystyrene tiles.
* Symptom: Damp patches surrounding window frames. Cause: A ''cold
bridge'' from the outside of the house is chilling the area around the
windows. Cure: Try lining the area around the window with polystyrene
sheeting.
* Symptom: A line of moisture up a wall on a ceiling or wall,
following the pipework. Cause: The cold water pipes are chilling the
area around them. Cure: Lag the pipework where possible.
* Symptom: Streaming windows. Cause: Windows are the first place
condensation is likely to form because they are exposed to the elements
and are very thin. Cure: Add an additional layer of glazing. If
condensation occurs between two layers of glazing, insert silica gel
crystals in the gap to absorb moisture.
* Symptom: Damp patches behind bedroom furniture. Cause: You may have
placed the furniture too close to the walls, producing chilly spots of
dead air where condensation occurs. Cure: Pull the furniture away from
the walls a few inches to improve air circulation.
* Symptom: A musty smell inside built-in wardrobes. Cause:
Insufficient ventilation is causing condensation. Cure: Fit small vents
at the top and bottom of the wardrobes. In severe cases fit a small
airing cupboard heater.

THE fate of the spare room is always problematical: dismal and
unwelcoming guest bedroom or musty, box-filled glory hole? It needn't
be. With a little imagination it can become the favourite room in the
house.
The spare bedroom has traditionally been an unused space in the house.
A repository for unwanted furniture like granny's old wardrobe, it can
make for chilly accommodation for overnight guests. Due to its main role
as a dumping ground for unwanted or ''tired'' furniture, the spare room
almost inevitably has little character of its own.
Some spare rooms were once lived in by children, now grown up and gone
from the home, and have the atmosphere of a kind of frozen shrine,
undecorated since last lived in and filled with ageing teenage
memorabilia.
Call it what you will, the back, spare, or box bedroom can, however,
provide fertile ground for experimenting with interior design techniques
and here you can take risks that you wouldn't dream of in any other part
in the house.
The key to transforming a spare room is to get rid of the bed. It is
seldom used, and can easily be replaced with a futon or sofa bed. With
the cumbersome and space consuming bed gone, a whole range of
possibilities opens up.
Perhaps one of the most common uses to which the revamped spare room
can be put is the home office or study. A place to do business in the
domestic setting is increasingly important given the increase in the
number of people working from home.
This can also be ideal for a quiet space for working on home accounts
and is a haven for children's homework projects. Having a special room
dedicated to study, free of the distractions of the TV, can help put
children in the right frame of mind to work. It also makes an ideal
hobbyist's or dressmaker's workroom.
Shelves, a desk and a filing cabinet are all you need to make an
efficient office space in your home. Many stores including Habitat, Muji
and Ikea now produce attractive office type furnishings -- chairs, desks
and storage units. You may save money, however, by going direct to
office supply shops.
Another alternative for the spare room, now increasing in popularity,
is to use it as a quiet sanctuary for exercise or meditation. Cumbersome
weight training equipment or a cycling machine can be located out of
harm's way. Those who want to exercie can do so in peace without
disturbing the rest of the family. For the body-obsessed, a wall covered
in mirrors can give an effective illusion of being at the gym.
More and more people are turning to meditation and other spiritual
pursuits. These are most effective if they are performed regularly in
surroundings conducive to peace and restfulness. The spare room makes an
ideal such retreat. A totally different atmosphere can be created from
the rest of the house by the use of decor and lighting.
A soft wash of one colour on walls, ceiling and woodwork can give the
feeling of being enclosed in a warm, protective cocoon. Effective
colours include soft lilac, or light blue, one of the traditional
colours of spirituality.
A windowless boxroom can easily be turned to advantage to create a
photographic darkroom or even converted to a sauna. Another alternative
is to convert it from chaotic junk room to carefuly planned storage
room, where everything is in a known place.
Carefully labelled industrial shelving can help, and a surprising
amount can be stored in this way, thus helping to remove needless
clutter from the rest of the house.

ALTHOUGH cyclamen can be available in beautiful flower for most of the
year, using sophisticated breeding methods, they are a main favourite of
the festive period.
Most are probably bought or given as presents, and end up in the
rubbish bin. This is a great pity. They are corm-forming plants -- the
fleshy, round bit of tissue from which leaves and flowers develop.
Commercial growers have given up growing plants from corms. Cyclamen
can be raised quickly from seed. However, that is no reason why corms
cannot be saved around the house.
A major reason for their demise is haphazard watering. If water is
applied on top of the corm, this invariably encourages rot, after which
there is little hope of survival.
Watering should be carefully applied to the compost -- not the corm --
until flowers begin to fade, and should gradually be withheld until
foliage dies back.
All that is necessary then is to keep the corms reasonably warm and
dry. This can be done under the bench in a greenhouse, or in other
suitable places. The corms can be knocked out of their pots and stored
in dry peat, or forest bark. For that matter, they can be kept in a
brown paper bag. They must be kept frost-free.
That is it until around September, when the corms are set out in
sufficiently large pots using a good quality potting compost. The corms
are only half buried and induced into growth under reasonably warm
conditions, such as a light window in the home, or on the bench of a
heated greenhouse.
If you fancy your chances with the corms, it is an interesting
experiment, and the resulting blooms are well worth the effort.

A FEW degrees can make a vast difference in plant growth rate, in
porches, conservatories or greenhouses.
Most gardeners try to economise with heat. Yet, there is a critical
level below which plants may survive but not really grow.
This does, of course, vary with species. I have some campanulas and
begonia semperflorens in my south-facing front porch.
Without any heating, it averages around 40 degrees Fahrenheit and goes
below that on cold nights. My plants were surviving but none of them
were at all happy.
There was little new growth, or flowering, in the case of the
begonias, and the campanulas were beginning to die back considerably.
It was only when I put in a thermostatically-controlled heater,
averaging around 45F, that I noticed a profound difference in growth
rate.
There was a fair bit of new growth and a degree of flowering with
begonias. If the growth continues, they should give quite a show in a
few weeks.
I have a 1.5kW conventor heater in the porch, with a built-in
thermostat. I reckon it is on for only a few hours a night, and off for
the rest of the day.
That is especialy so when there is a bit of sunshine around. The
running cost should not be more than, say, #1 a week.
To my mind, that is not a lot to pay for a lot of colour, and the
family like it too, when they come to visit.
Longer days and more light does have a part to play. A bit of heat can
make a great difference. Providing the very minimum can be a great bonus
to plants.
I had a wander round the Kibble Palace in Glasgow's Botanic Gardens
the other day. Many shrubs were flowering, including camellias. It made
me think of spring, just around the corner.
It's not so much a case of waving a magic wand, just giving plants
what they need to do more than merely survive.
Don't grudge your plants that bit of heat. Whether in a palace, or
your own front porch, it will keep them, and you, a lot happier.

THE recent high winds have left their usual trail of destruction.
There are twigs and branches all over the place. Pergolas and interwoven
fencing have also suffered, particularly when the fencing has not been
fully anchored into the ground.
There also the inevitable blowing over of roses, or young trees not
adequately staked.
High winds can often put paid to polythene-covered structures. After a
hard blow such as we have had, one begins to think seriously about the
importance of shelter.
Privet hedging is a bit of a nuisance, in terms of cutting and
trimming, but it takes a lot to beat it as an effective shelter. If you
do have a hedge, it can be readily thickened by taking hardwood cuttings
now and popping them into the ground. There is usually a high percentage
of success.

THE business of running a garden centre is a bit like a perpetual
motion machine fuelled by the changing seasons.
Just as soon as the festive decorations were taken down, Andrew Duncan
at Milngavie was off to an exhibition at Harrogate to purchase stock for
next Christmas. But depsite rushing about, he told me me was very happy
with the level of trade over the season, having twice sold out his stock
of pot plants.
Another garden centre boss, David Clark, seemed happy too. He is busy
planning for an international garden centre conference to be held in
Scotland in two years. All selling centres are looking forward to the
new season, and hoping the weather will be a bit more accommodating than
1994.
Soon the new season seeds will be on display. All should be date
stamped, to ensure the public get value for money in respect of seeds to
produce a high germination.
Stocks of containerised shrubs will shortly be augmented with a vast
range of species and varieties. And according to rosarian Alistair
Urquhart, roses are climbing back into popularity after a bleak period.
There was a lot of black spot, but Alistair finds the public
appreciate that spraying the ground with Armillatox in March, followed
by regular fortnightly spraying of Roseclear or Systhane can keep bushes
free of this blight.
Stocks I saw at Alistair's and elsewhere looked excellent. He was
saying that sections of the trade did the industry no favours at all in
selling tender plants out of season. Foisting poor quality plants on the
general public is just not on.
Though I found the general consensus of opinion on the start of
another gardening season, weather permitting, centred on March, really
keen gardeners are on the move well before then. Some of the first off
the mark are those who like to raise their own vegetables and flowers
from seed.
In recent years, there has been a tendency to buy in seedlings, with
VAT on fuel discouraging the heating of greenhouses.
I also asked centre operators about stocking up on peatless compost.
The answer seemed to be ''yes'', but with considerable reservations. It
takes time for gardeners to adjust to a new technique in terms of
watering and feeding.
I expect the trend to peatless compost to be long-term. It will
happen, inevitably, and too will join the peatless brigade but only to a
certain extent. And I feel many gardeners will adopt a similar attitude.
On the equipment side, there are a number of interesting developments.
The grow-pot, which is a modified ring system, would seem to be firmly
established. Having tried it, this past year, I was happy with the
results.
I see solar-powered lawnmowers are on the horizon. I sincerely hope we
get enough sun to use them. Lightweight cultivators to take the effort
out of digging or forking are expected to enjoy a booom. It would be
worthwhile looking at this in collective terms, spreading the cost.
With these exciting prospects ahead, little wonder I am looking
forward to the new season.

THE SPIRIT OF BRITAIN: An Illustrated Guide to Literary Britain By
Susan Hill and Piers Dudgeon.
Headline, #19.99 (pp 224).
NOTHING becomes a book like a good piece of landscape, and it is a
rare patch of earth that has not at some time become a book, good or
otherwise.
The English Lakes are Wordsworth Country, like it or not; Hardy has
''Wessex''; tourists are invited to infest ''Bronte country'', ''Burns
country'', or (from the sublime to the meticulous) the innocent
buildings where Stevenson, or Dickens, or Shakespeare lingered, however
briefly. Postcards are generally available, books less common.
Stratford upon Avon is perhaps the epitome of
literature-as-scenic-heritage. A pretty town mutated into a hideous
tourist ''experience'', it exhibits, for the majority who fail to attend
an actual play, that impulse to taxidermy never far from the surface of
British culture. Visitors may be hazy about the Shakespearean texts, and
few much care about the writer's linguistic debts to Warwickshire or its
landscape's role in several of the comedies, but they know a shrine when
they see one.
The mania may be regarded as a kind of cultural decadence, or simply
the consequence of having altogether too much history. Britain's
landscapes -- for there are many of them -- are multi-layered. The
London of Dickens is no longer visible yet it maintains a ghostly
presence. Wordsworth's Lakes are littered with modern ''conveniences''
(prophetically, he abhorred the coming of the railways) yet somehow
maintain their identity. Warwickshire may be said to owe as much to
George Eliot as to Shakespeare and would, today, be unrecognisable to
both, but something of each somehow persists in its scenery.
That something, conventionally identified as the spirit of place, is
not best served by the heritage industry yet it is, as Susan Hill points
out in her introduction, profoundly important to writers. In several of
Hardy's novels  Dorset is as much an actor as any of the characters.
Stevenson, who never shirked the duty to invent, was conscientious in
his reporting of Highland landscape. Places are inspirations,
touchstones, historical records, repositories; they have an identity --
a voice, if you like -- all of their own. More to the point of this
book, writers have helped to make them what they are.
The Spirit of Britain appears at first glance as an appealing coffee
table book but is actually fairly ingenious. Hill and Dudgeon avoid many
of the conventional choices (notably Shakespeare) and prefer to locate
the writers in the places themselves, however obscure, rather than tour
the shrines and museums. Glasgow, rarely on the literary tourist's
itinerary, is illustrated, for example, with quotations from writers as
diverse as Smollett (1771) and McIlvanney (1977). Stevenson's Kidnapped
route is well-explored but the account of Buchan's Galloway is, if
anything, more entertaining.
Much is unfamiliar. While Shropshire is given over, unsurprisingly, to
Houseman, Hereford and Worcestershire are represented by Langland's
Piers Ploughman and the mystical Thomas Traherne. Berkshire,
predictably, has Cookham Dean, inspiration for The Wind in the Willows,
but Tayside, in the form of Dalguise, is depicted merely as an
inspiration for Beatrix Potter.
The scope for quibbling is vast.
One serious objection, hard to justify whatever one's political
preferences, is the omission of Northern Ireland. The difference between
'Britain'' and ''United Kingdom'' is clear enough, but the exclusion of
the province raises a question about the coherence of the whole project.
Does Shetland (here represented, irritatingly, only by MacDiarmid) have
any real connection with Suffolk? Are the Mearns really in the same
literary country as Dorset? What is this Britain? And why, to quibble
again, Shetland but no Orkney, unless it be that editor and compiler
know nothing of George Mackay Brown, a writer utterly of one place?
Why the Pentlands but not Perthshire? Why Manchester at all? Any book
of this sort will summon such objections, but the extent to which
private literary landscapes, the stuff of art, become merely picturesque
raises interesting questions. Might it not be the case that with
tempting, well-illustrated books such as this lazy readers claim places
from writers, and thus erode, if only imaginatively, the qualities that
attracted them in the first place? Literature, like the past, is another
country.
Better that it were not pillaged.

NEW year, new horizons. And new horizons don't come much more
promising than those in Argyll, one of Britain's great undiscovered
gems. The locals claim that the old county of Argyll has more coastline
than the whole of France -- not so surprising when you look at a map and
begin to calculate the long fingers of inlet, peninsula, and sea loch
which dig deep into the West Coast all the way from Arrochar down to
Campbeltown and back north to Oban and beyond.
Estate agent D M Hall has two Argyll properties which could provide
those new horizons on Scotland's West Coast. John Coleman of D M Hall
says that many Scots want to change their city lifestyle for the
tranquillity of the countryside, but even when you can afford it, it is
only luck if the right house is on the market at the right time.
''When such a property becomes available beside a loch you really do
have to be quick,'' he says.
He believes that he has two such special properties for sale, each of
which is set above a sea loch with private access and fishing rights.
Woodlands was built about 100 years ago and is on the eastern shore of
Loch Goil, about a mile from the village of Lochgoilhead. It is a
stone-built house with strong Italian architectural influence, including
distinctive overhanging eaves supported on timber pillars, and cast-iron
balconies to the front of the house.
It has a sitting room, dining room, study, kitchen and utility room,
five bedrooms, and two bathrooms. It comes with more than an acre of
ground which runs down to the shore of the loch where there is a
boathouse and garage, some 50 metres of loch frontage, fishing rights
and boat mooring.
The property is being marketed at offers over #195,000.
Further west, not far from the fishing village of Tarbert, is Escart,
a small West Coast estate with great views down West Loch Tarbert. The
property has about 164 acres of productive parkland and hill grazings,
woodland and shore, and is located in a very attractive part of the
Kintyre Peninsula.
The stone house has a slate roof, large farmhouse kitchen, sitting
room, dining room, seven bedrooms, two bathrooms.
The gardens contain some of Argyll's famous standing stones, Stone Age
artefacts which attract thousands of visitors to the county every year,
and which the agent says have ''assisted greatly'' Escart's bed and
breakfast business.
Behind the house is a range of traditional farm buildings. There is
also a small cottage which requires renovation.
The property is for sale in four lots. Lot 1 consists of the house,
buildings, cottage, and 40 acres and loch frontage, and has an asking
price of over #250,000.

COLORED PEOPLE By Henry Louis Gates Jr.
Viking, #15 (pp 216).
IN his autobiographical novel Henry Gates, a Professor of English at
Harvard, has ''tried to evoke a colored world of the fifties, a Negro
world of the early sixties, and a black world of the later sixties, from
the point of view of the boy I was''. He prefers the term ''coloured''
to ''African American'' because it conjures up his mother's voice and
the ''sepia tones'' of his childhood.
Gates wants it both ways. He wants ''to experience a humanity that is
neither colorless nor reducible to colour . . . Bach and James Brown.''
He recalls that during the composition of this book in Italy he sat in a
sidewalk cafe and a group of black men walking by nodded to him in
silent and subtle communion, ''passing boats in a sea of white folk''.
Gates is both thrilled with the solidarity offered by this mute
exchange and acutely aware of the exclusive nature of such
identification. He juxtaposes his father's caution against the cop-out
of clannishness with his own daughter's embarrassment at her father's
acknowledging a ''complete stranger'' on the street. Later, Gates
reminds us of the first question people around him asked after Kennedy's
assassination: ''Was he colored?'' Like Mike Tyson and O J Simpson, a
coloured perpetrator ''could implicate the entire race''. This
collective guilt is the chilling counterpoint to that warm glance of
recognition.
Gates draws on a rich storehouse of memorable reminiscences that fuse
personal and political experience. He tells how his gifted older brother
was refused a prize because the hotel where the family were to stay for
the ceremony was segregated: ''no matter what you did or how you did it,
it didn't matter because it was their world, their sea, and their tide,
and your little black ass was about as significant as a grain of yellow
sand''.
Another significant episode occurs when Gates is rushed to hospital
with a dislocated hip. The doctor cannot find the source of the pain,
but during his examination he discovers that the boy wants to be a
doctor when he grows up, and quickly concludes that the ''injury'' is
psychosomatic, brought on by the youth's vaulting ambition: ''Back then,
'overachiever' designated a sort of pathology: the dire consequence of
overstraining your natural capacity. A coloured kid who thought he could
become a doctor -- just for instance -- was headed for a breakdown.''
Although ''doctors were sacred, and their word was scripture'',
Gates's mother -- a towering figure who glowed at the words of Malcolm
X, yet was a much called-upon expert in hot-comb hair-straightening --
made her own diagnosis. Reluctant to have her son crippled by prejudice,
she took him to another infirmary 60 miles away, where he had three
operations in the next year for a slipped epithesis. We do not learn
whether the first physician ever found a cure for his all too common
ailment, underachieving for others.
In Scotland, where affirmations of identity are increasingly viewed
with suspicion, where sympathetic literary representations of the past
are frequently dismissed out of hand as kailyard, where local heroes and
local colour are air-brushed by what Gates has elsewhere termed the
''racism of universalism'', his evocation of ''sepia time'' in a small
town, and his celebration of being ''coloured'', however qualified and
complex, is a breath of fresh air, as honest and unadorned as the films
of Bill Douglas.
The way that Gates works through the tensions and contradictions that
beset any marginalised individual or community lends great power to his
prose, which, in the context of a complacently deracinated modern world,
aches with authenticity. Colored People is a moving, magical blend of
love and anger, sentiment and soul. Identity doesn't have to be all or
nothing. Gates has it both ways. Bach and Brown, in fact.

SUNRISE WITH SEA MONSTER By Neil Jordan. Chatto &amp; Windus, #9.99 (pp
183),
THE opening passages can be confusing. Uncertain images, cross, merge,
and dissolve into separate locations as a series of episodes flare and
disappear.
They are visual, strong, and colourful. They are beautifully written,
introduce the characters and their story, and though the initial
arrangement seems random and hinders the narrative, these episodes can
also be clear and individually compelling.
The early pages and their bright visuality would make a wonderful
opening sequence for a film. Neil Jordan won an oscar for his screenplay
of The Crying Game; he wrote and directed such films as Angel, Company
of Wolves, and Mona Lisa. We therefore expect his novels to be visually
inspired, filled with good dialogue, atmosphere, and cinematic
references, capable of being translated straight on to the screen.
We would not expect such command of language. His descriptive prose
and characterisations are superb. There is no key, no moment of clarity;
it simply develops. We grow used to the style, to the spare, clear
language that holds the book together and disguises Jordan's compelling
gift as a storyteller.
The title story in his first collection, Night in Tunisia, was hailed
by Sean O'Faolain as ''one of the most remarkable stories that I have
read in Irish storytelling since, or indeed before, Joyce.''
Many of that collection's preoccupations have surfaced in the films
and later novels. But seldom have they been so clearly delineated as in
this new book. Dance bands and politics, seaside towns and fairgrounds,
surprise and boredom, love and casual treachery appear in one form or
another.
The problem with the opening is that it plays with time. The incidents
seem unconnected, leaving the reader with nothing to grasp, neither date
nor reference. There is a feeling of uncertainty rather than mystery. We
are unfamiliar with the characters and do not know their locations.
The story gradually emerges. It is set in Ireland between the 1920s
and the 1940s and in Spain towards the end of the Civil War. It is
essentially a story of multiple betrayal told through a series of
flashbacks. If Jordan's slow fade into story has its drawbacks, the
stealthy way characters and their histories are revealed more than
compensates. The story is narrated by Donal Gore whose father is an
Irish political collective, a Protestant who became a Roman Catholic
Republican gunman, finishing his career as a Minister in the Dail.
Donal is in prison during the Spanish Civil War. The initial
flashbacks are slivers of memory that sustain him: setting fishing lines
on the beach with his father, his mother's illness and death, music
lessons with his future stepmother. He seems to have inherited personal
and national betrayal.
He is released from prison by a German officer who expects him to spy
out of gratitude. Back in Ireland his father has changed. The early
images and their unity are mocked by betrayal as Donal's father is taken
beyond language.
Jordan's achievement would challenge any film-maker. It is founded in
the hopeless relationship that develops between Donal and his father,
the triangular relationship between Donal, his father, and stepmother,
and their setting in a background of political deception and betrayal
that brings a welcome realism to the mythologies of Irish politics.
Donal's random treachery and the damage he inflicts on his father are a
neat reversal of how father/son relationships are usually portrayed.
The stealthy way the story unfolds is punctuated by specific events
whose significance could easily be lost. ''Then, on the day after De
Valera presented his condolences to the German embassy on the death of
Hitler I resurrected my father'' is the final chapter's opening
sentence.

CHRIS BOYCE casts a critical eye on books for computer buffs
THERE'S a common misconception among the ''computerate'' that print is
a dying medium. If you ever talk to them, ask how many books on the
Internet they've acquired over the past year and watch them frown.
The Internet, the international network of computer networks, has not
only been expanding prodigiously but has generated something of a
publishing shockwave. In 1994 literally hundreds of volumes crashed on
to the computer-section shelves of bookshops all over the world.
This creates an embarrassment of abundance. Should you simply be
looking for a good introduction, there are two I'd urge you to consider.
For some time it was rumoured that ''Wavey Davey'' Winder, one of the
UK's home-grown 'net gurus, was writing a book. All You Need To Know
About The Internet is here at last and the wait has really been
worthwhile. This is the introduction I'd give my nine-year-old daughter
or my 90-year-old granny. The text is limpid, splendidly organised, with
plenty of examples and mini-directories listed for every facility he
mentions. There's even software included. This is simply the best.
Alternatively there's Ed Krol's The Whole Internet User's Guide and
catalogue. This has been a standard introduction for new users since
1992. It is aimed at the inexperienced, like Winder's book, but goes
deeper. Since it is 544 pages long, this is what you'd expect. Again,
you should consider this one very seriously.
The new edition is greatly expanded and covers among other things
World Wide Web, the major Internet phenomenon of the past year.
The Web, or WWW, is a vast complex of linked documents. Its great
advantage is that with the proper tools, like Mosaic or Cello, it is
possible to browse this rapidly growing library, following words
highlighted in the text of the documents themselves. As these documents
can carry pictures (some even have sound!) this is a very popular way to
work with the Internet.
Now something strictly for the serious surfers. As its title suggest,
Bill Eager's Using the World Wide Web is devoted entirely to WWW. Let's
say you're familiar with the 'net and want to start writing your own
''home pages'' or find out as much as possible about Mosaic, Cello and
other Web browsers. This is the one for you with clear text, good
images, and lots of examples.
Although the principal point about the Internet is its international
flavour, too much published material is US-oriented, reflecting the
'net's origins, perhaps, but often irritating. Two books which
counterbalance this are Ivan Pope's Internet UK and Sue Schofield's The
UK Internet Book. Both are worth casting an eye over if you feel phobic
about the New World.
Finally, what do you do when you just want to have fun? Well, first of
all you take a look into Andy Eddy's Internet After Hours. Then do fun
things like subscribing to the Scottish country dancing mailing list at
the University of Frankfurt, adventure your way through MUDs (Multi User
Dungeons), and bump into some other adventurers out there in cyberspace
or natter away in real-time to anyone who shares your interests on the
'net equivalent to CB radio, IRC (Internet Relay Chat).
Whether you're a complete newbie or a seasoned cyber-surfer, The
Internet Golden Directory is a yellow pages to what's available and
where to find it. It neatly complements the general introduction type of
book as these can hardly give much space to the mass of material
available out there. Interestingly enough, it is actually marketed in
the USA as The Internet Yellow Pages but over here they had to change
that as BT has the words ''Yellow Pages'' trademarked! Again, this is a
must.

SIX foot two, eyes of blue, Arnold Schwarzenegger's after you. It
doesn't quite scan but you get the nub of the gist; the gravamen of my
jib being that another cinematic effulgent from the Austrian Oak has
arrived in its rightful home -- the video emporium -- as keen-eyed and
gambolling as a Christmas puppy in its desperate desire to please at any
price.
No more post-modern, self-referential shenanigans a la Last Action
Hero for this little baby; none of Terminator 2's pinko liberal hogwash
about promising the nine-year-old hero he won't kill any baddies before
going on to shoot them in the legs and then disgruntedly muttering
''He'll live . . . ''
No siree, Bob. Guns. Big guns. Guns pointed wantonly at wrong-doers
and discharged without due care for whether their heads explode or not.
Big cars driven recklessly at speed in the direction of oil tankers.
Hilariously improbable weaponry like bazookas drawing beads on
helicopters above thronging city streets. The stuff that made Arnie what
he is today.
All of which makes True Lies (rental, cert. 18) a thrilling two hours
worth, albeit the kind of guilty thrill that can be matched only by
calling California from someone else's phone or taping Supermarket Sweep
to watch in the evening.
Shamelessly ''adapted'' from the French flick La Totale and directed
by Terminator helmsman James Cameron, it starts with a coy little
hommage to the James Bond series, as Arnie, in the guise of super-agent
Harry Trasker, emerges from a fountain, sheds wetsuit to reveal
immaculate white tux, and swerves with forged invite into a hyper-swank
diplomats' ball, there to impress the foxy female constituency with the
fluidity of his two-step, his fluency in Peruvian, and his all-pervasive
air of elegantly cosmopolitan mystique. Then things start exploding.
The hilarious hinge upon which the plot swings like a barndoor under
mortar attack is that Harry's wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) remains unaware of
hubby's vocation in life, believing him to be a computer operator. Oh,
the hilarity of those ''Good day at the office, dear?'' ''It was murder
. . . '' exchanges, hilarity further compounded when Mrs Trasker herself
gets enmeshed in espionage activities at the behest of a strange man she
meets in a Chinese restaurant.
Naturally, the paths of the spying spouses cross in the field of
combat, occasioning the most startling scene in the picture, in which
hubby captures wife and anonymously interrogates her on her marital
fidelity. The French being the French, La Totale handled the combination
of psychological sadism and comedy with a certain Gallic naturalism;
here, in the land of popcorn and Saturday-night dates, the scene comes
across like a crass boy's fantasy and sours the taste of what is
otherwise an exhilarating, gloriously trashy confection.
Philip Roth's claim that Schindler's List amounted to little more than
''emotional pornography'' leapt from the news pages recently. The remark
jarred because not only are we used to hearing the film receive
unanimously rave notices but, as a Jew, Roth is the last person from
whom we'd expect to hear such a ringing denunciation for so obviously
sincere a film.
Perhaps that was Roth's point: the universal and obligatory fawning
over any representation of the Holocaust is in danger of hardening into
a kneejerk acceptance, preventing the kind of serious, objective
discussion that oxygenates our concept of freedom.
All things considered, however, Schindler's List (rental, cert. 18)
remains a startling piece of work, as much for its shoddy, cinema verite
style as for the clarity of its message. Nobody who witnesses the
gas-chamber scene, with the camera being herded alongside the victims,
will ever again regard the Holocaust as a distant, irrelevant nightmare
from another age.
Finally, it's a sad goodbyeee and a predictable paraphrasing of E J
Thribb along the lines of Farewell then, Peter Cook/You never really
fulfilled your early promise/That's what they're all saying to Britain's
most natural and subversive funny man who shuffled off the mortal thingy
this week.
As memorials go, Peter Cook Talks Golf Balls (retail, #12.99) isn't
the most distinguished but, as Cook adopts the personas of three
lunatics all obsessed with what Mark Twain called ''a good walk
spoiled'', it gives an idea of the splenetic wistfulness that fuelled
his best work. There's nothing here that reaches the heights of Cook's
failed football manager Alan Latchley, who deathlessly declared:
''Football is about nothing unless it's about something. And what it's
about is . . . football!'' Now that's comedy.

CHRISTINA ROSSETTI: A LITERARY BIOGRAPHY By Jan Marsh.
Jonathan Cape, #25 (pp 634).
AS so much of her private life remains shrouded in mystery, Christina
Rossetti (1830-94) is an ideal subject for speculative modern
biographers. William Rossetti only knew his sister was ''ill'' in the
summer of 1845. Christina's latest biographer, Jan Marsh, thinks she
knows better. Christina had a severe nervous breakdown.
Christina destroyed many personal papers so modern biographers lacking
information have to use their imaginations. Lona Mosk Packer's Christina
Rossetti (1963) claimed Christina had an affair with Scottish painter
William Bell Scott though no evidence supports this supposition.
In Kathleen Jones's Learning Not To Be First (1991), Christina becomes
a Victorian version of Sylvia Plath, inflicting violence on herself in
fits of passion. Speculating on Christina's development between the ages
of 13 and 18, Jones acknowledges ''it is difficult to discover exactly
what happened'' yet discovers a psychosomatic condition which
emotionally exhausted Christina and encouraged her to hide her anxiety
behind the barrier of her Anglican faith.
Marsh easily outstrips Packer and Jones in speculation. Having
established, in her own mind, that Christina had a breakdown in 1845 she
seeks to explain it by asking leading questions about incestuous abuse:
''Did Christina's father in his despair make sexual advances or requests
she could not refuse?'' Was Christina unwillingly implicated in some
sexual activity at the age of 12 or 13 that left a permanent sense of
guilt? Even though ''direct evidence is lacking'', Marsh is sure
incestuous abuse occurred and affected Christina's character.
Let us focus on some facts that inform Christina's astonishing
creativity. She enjoyed a positively artistic family environment: her
Marsh-maligned father Gabriele, a lapsed Catholic who earned his living
as Professor of Italian at King's College, London, wrote poems; her
mother Frances was the sister of Byron's travelling physician John
Polidori, author of The Vampyre; her maternal grandfather Gaetano
Polidori was an author.
Christina became involved in an influential artistic movement. Of the
original seven members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood two were
Christina's own brothers, Dante Gabriel and William, and James Collinson
became her fiance in 1848, the year the PRB was founded. Known as the
High Priestess of Pre-Raphaelitism, Christina supplied the Victorian
face of the Virgin Mary by modelling for Dante Gabriel's The Girlhood of
Mary Virgin (1849) which also featured Christina's mother as St Anne. As
Christina's sister Maria is identified as the nun in Charles Collins's
Convent Thoughts (1850-1) this completes a remarkable trio of early
Victorian icons.
It was the piety of the PRB and Dante Gabriel's vision of Christina as
a meek madonna that encouraged the fanatically religious Collinson to
regard her as the perfectly virtuous woman. A Catholic convert, he
rejoined the Anglican communion after Christina declared she could not
marry a Roman Catholic. In 1850, however, Collinson reconverted to
Catholicism and resigned from the PRB as he felt he could no longer
associate with a movement that eschewed his faith. Collinson had chosen
his Christ rather than his Christina.
Marsh interprets the end of this affair as another traumatic shock for
the long-suffering poet. Christina's engagement and heart had been
''cruelly broken''; her love for Collinson ''had to be revoked and
suppressed''; she was overwhelmed by ''shock and distress''. The notion
of Christina as a fragile icon shattered by the men in her life does not
take enough notice of the strength of her poetic imagery.
On April 27, 1859, Christina completed Goblin Market, a tale of two
sisters -- Lizzie and Laura -- tempted by the forbidden fruit of the
goblins. While it can be read as a celebration of a courageous sister,
for Lizzie leaves ''the evil people/Worn out by her resistance'', Marsh
opts for a simplistic sexual approach: ''the goblin assault on Laura is
a seduction, while that on Lizzie is attempted rape'' and, of course,
the poem draws on ''childish memories of sexual desire and perhaps other
arousals''. Or perhaps not. Goblin Market is too subtle a poem to be
psychoanalysed by a biographer committed to a theory of sexual
repression.
Christina left brother William to sum up her life and he tried to be
truthful in his memoir of 1904 but William's work does not satisfy the
modern appetite for scandal, hence the school of speculative
biographers. Marsh is a fine scholar who, following modern fashion,
spends too much of her talent searching for guilty secrets.

ACCORDING to the latest audience ratings -- and thanks to Radio 1's
sharp decline -- Radio 2 is now the most popular of all the BBC's
domestic radio networks; but that still doesn't prevent the old Light
Programme from turning in an alarmingly patchy performance, particularly
in the evenings. Last Wednesday night, for example, I listened in strict
succession to the first in a new series of World-wide Concerts
(traditional Jewish song, musically fascinating, dismally presented), to
a programme on the singing pubs of
Cornwall (miserably short of relevant musical history and background),
and to Anita Bhalla's British-Asian show, Across Two Cultures, which
featured an intelligent and completely fascinating interview with the
Indian-born, Birmingham-based storyteller, Vayu Naidu; and you could
argue that one serious cultural hit out of three programmes is not a bad
rate.
But there was something about the other two shows that I found
disturbing, as if the producers were spoiling quite an impressive
programme-making ship -- a lot of information-gathering, performing
skill, effort -- for want of a ha'porth of analytical tar, of really
penetrating explanation of what these musical phenomena mean and where
they spring from. The very same fault is weakening what should be one of
Radio 2's most interesting current efforts, a Thursday evening series
called From Taunton to Tennessee and Back in which Ashley Hutchings,
''the doyen of English folk'', explores the cross-fertilisation of
British and American folk music.
Once again, a huge amount of fascinating material is assembled; this
week's programme dealt affectionately with the Appalachian journeys of
the Edwardian folk-song collector Cecil Sharp, during which he
discovered a whole strand of lost English folk culture surviving in the
new world. But the script slithers about like a jelly, lost for want of
a stout historical framework, a sense of context, and a firm storyline.
The confusion between ''English'' and ''British'' folk culture is total,
and the lack of precision about the origins of the material infuriating.
I cannot imagine, for instance, how it is possible to play a piece of
Midwestern choral music whose only surviving British relative is the
strange, wild-sounding, Gaelic psalm-singing of the Hebrides, without
even mentioning that living tradition.
I wonder if there were any black exponents of the British folk
tradition in the Appalachians. No doubt there were; as the BBC's man in
Washington, Gavin Esler, pointed out this week -- in a sharp Radio 4
documentary that revealed him as a clever interviewer and a strong
storyteller -- there were certainly plenty of black cowboys, although
they always somehow reappeared as white men in the Hollywood films based
on their adventures. In fact, the more one
learns about the politics of race in North America, the more one
wonders why the level of black rage and alienation is not even higher
than it is, and this week I kept coming across programmes that threw a
fitful light on the subject, from Radio 4's intriguing double bill of
Monday Plays about LBJ and the Great Society -- the great moments of
anti-racist legislation in the 1960s -- to Radio Scotland's sharp little
programme Future Perfect, in which Professor Sheila MacLean of Glasgow
recorded Steve Jones, Britain's most famous geneticist, frankly
describing the history of genetic sciences, with special reference to
Nazism and other theories of racial superiority, as ''outrageous and
disastrous''.
No doubt, though, about the most shocking fragment of race politics
broadcast this week; it came in Radio 4's PM programme, which saw fit to
broadcast the police tape of the voice of the late Nicole Simpson,
murdered wife of the famous O J, making a desperate 911 emergency call
during one of her ex-husband's attacks on her. I don't know about the
ethics of broadcasting such material although I suppose it has been in
the public domain in the United States for months; nor have the courts
decided whether to admit it as evidence in Simpson's murder trial. But
what is astonishing, given the existence of this harrowing tape, is that
O J is apparently still a folk hero for many millions of Americans, his
terrible and perhaps murderous rage against the pretty white woman who
left him simply excused or ignored. What a legacy, what a disaster; and
what a miserable reaping of a whirlwhind of hate that was sown too long
and too hard, and now cannot be stopped.

AT last. A soulmate for Prince Charles; and a personality whom many
regard as the BBC's biggest single asset. David Attenborough is having
conversations with and about plants.
Among the perceived eccentricities of the Prince of Wales, his
relationship with his garden is the least mockable. What gardener
doesn't talk to the plants, even if only to curse the intransigence of a
dandelion root? What gardener hasn't complimented a clematis on its
runaway energy or silently apologised to the rose bush undergoing
secateurs surgery? Within their own terms, plants are sentient; they
respond to stimuli, and maybe they even respond to the human voice.
Whatever the range of their communication skills they won't find a
finer interlocutor than the boy David, whose peripatetic passion for
natural history has given him the secret of eternal youth. Age barely
withers him as he moves between desert and rain forest, ice-cap and
volcanic ring. The Private Life of Plants (BBC1) has been three years in
the making, yet David seems to have shed them rather than put them on.
It's now 16 years since his epic Life On Earth, and he looks only a
little chunkier, a little more crumpled. Is it something to do with
crossing and re-crossing all those time zones?
There is, perhaps, a certain archness about the title of his latest
oeuvre, but that's television for you. Even plants must be made sexy. As
it happens, I'm of the opinion that plants are naturally sexy,
especially when their activities are recorded by time-lapse photography:
all that writhing and arching and swelling and exploding, like the
demented imagery of a Ken Russell movie. As for the foxglove, opening
its lips to receive the questing bee -- its eager promiscuity was
downright embarrassing as David described the ingenuity of seed
dispersal.
We haven't even got to reproduction, but the visual potential of this
exquisite and improving genre of soft porn is already breathtaking. Do I
sound a little feverish? Perhaps because I had my first experience of
the use of time-lapse photography in nature study at an impressionable
age, when my hormones were starting to rage. Second-year botany, and
Miss Grant set up the projector and showed her class of 13-year-olds a
film of nasturtium seeds germinating. In those innocent days we couldn't
even make a metaphor of the thrusting roots and the unfolding shoots,
but we sensed excitement in these voluptuous images. Next week, Growing
-- ''a look at some of the extraordinary ways in which plants gain
nutrition and protection . . . '' I can't wait.
Cinematically, The Private Life of Plants was to Treasures in Trust
(BBC1) what Federico Fellini is to James Ivory. Edward Mirzoeff, who
produced and directed this reverential tribute to the National Trust in
its centenary year, ain't neither, but he has more in common with
Ivory's safe, over-controlled camera work than with Fellini's dangerous
wizardry. This film had so many dull sequences of shots of Trust
property that you felt crushed by Adam cornices and smothered by
herbaceous borders. Much of it looked like a promo video for the charity
which is the country's most successful, harvesting over #70m a year;
which all goes to show that the British care even more about bricks and
mortar and chunks of land than they do about animals.
I declare a prejudice against the National Trust and its Scottish arm,
who get no money from me, and who manage to irritate me almost every
time I step on their property. They prohibit too much (look what
happened in the Mirzoeff film when they took over a fanciful house in
Devon; the people who came to wonder at its feather-and-shell
ornamentation can now admire it only by remote control camera). They
have silly rules. (Trust teashops aren't allowed to serve ''foreign''
food like lasagne.) They blight the landscape with their self-promoting
sales points, pimping for members like brogue-and-Pringle versions of
the Tenerife time-share tout.
Aware that the Trust has its critics, this 75-minute essay made some
weak efforts to give the hostile their say. The hunting controversy was
rehearsed, confirming impressions that those who attack and those who
defend field sports are equally disagreeable, but the more interesting
questions about the values of its aims and methods were only feebly
pursued. By and large, Mirzoeff did for the Trust what he did for the
Queen in his last BBC film, Elizabeth R: doffed his cap to both of them.
Which, if nothing else, shows consistency, as HM and the NT are part and
parcel of the same heritage industry.
Scottish Television have come up with a good wheeze, if shamelessly
derivative. The Time of your Life is a tartan update of The Rock and
Roll Years, BBC1's bebopping raid on the actuality archives. Scottish
have pinched the formula and put a kilt on it, taking the 80s as the
decade for their eight-part series and setting the Scottish dimension to
the music of local bands and singers.
Some intimation of the potential for bathos in this idea is contained
in the Cowcaddens press release: '' . . . a momentous decade in Scottish
history which included such cultural landmarks as the Falklands War, the
era of Thatcherism, Live Aid, the death of football legend Jock Stein,
the Graeme Souness era at Rangers, and the marriage of Prince Charles
and Diana Spencer.''
I leave it to readers to identify the peculiarly Scottish cultural
landmarks in that list, and ask if we can't do better than that over 10
years. Happily, the first programme was willing to range outside the
policies of Parkhead and Ibrox in its search for cultural landmarks, and
after a brief look at the international headlines of 1980 -- Ronald
Reagan in office, the Iraq-Iran war, Zimbabwe's independence -- brought
the domestic scene into focus to the sound of Barbara Dickson, Spandau
Valley, B A Robertson, and Sheena Easton.
Nineteen eighty. It seems but a blink ago: the year the national steel
strike brought out the Ravenscraig workforce, the year male
homosexuality was decriminalised in Scotland, Bill Forsyth's first
feature film was released, Hercules the Bear escaped in Benbecula, the
Alexander Keilland oil rig capsized in the North Sea, the Singer factory
closed in Clydebank. Michaell Kelly was Glasgow's Lord Provost, George
Best was playing for Hibs, Alan Wells won Olympic gold in Moscow, and
Jimmy Boyle and I got married. Although not to each other.
The huge appeal of these fast-food servings of recent news-gathering
with their pop-music garnish is that they make you feel part of history.
They slot you into the global continuum and prove your existence. I
can't get enough of them. ''January, February, la-la-la-la-la . . . '' I
can't wait for someone to start on the 90s.
Bad Boys was bad news for Ian Pattison fans, who include me. There
were some good moments -- Anne Marie Timoney's barmaid seeing off
troublesome customers with a Magnum-style handgun and the comment, ''all
this for #2.40 an hour'' -- and there were some good performances, but
it didn't add up to much more than what it was: an extended television
commercial whose characters are ciphers representing suave Glaswegian
villainy and chirpy Cockney knavery. Back to Govan, Ian.

SOME films start off promising much, and then fail to deliver, a bit
like a truncated roller-coaster ride which sends one hurtling down and
fails to send one hurtling back up to hurtle down again. Roland
Emmerich's Stargate (PG) is such a film. The first half-hour setting up
the story is terrific, but once the adventure begins, while the
individual incidents are efficiently enough managed and the special
effects quite impressive, the whole thing rapidly goes downhill. Largely
this is due to the lack of both plot and characters with any substance,
beyond such authority the stars can lend their roles. One starts to feel
cheated. As Peggy Lee used to sing -- Is that all there is?
The film opens in 1928 in Egypt with the discovery of a mysterious
round stone covered in hieroglyphics surrounded by a metal ring near the
Pyramids. What can this ''machine'' be for? Then we move to the present
day. An eccentric but brilliant Egyptologist (James Spader, gently sexy
in granny glasses, with long blond hair forever getting in his eyes) is
hired by a strange old lady, Viveca Lindfors, to decipher the thing.
Being terribly, terribly brilliant he does in two weeks what has
defeated everybody else for almost 70 years. The machine proves a kind
of combination lock or star gate, through which it is possible to travel
to another planet. Beam-me-up-Scottie stuff.
The US army, which is funding the project, takes over and Spader,
along with a tough colonel Kurt Russell, going through the macho motions
in a pasteboard role and an assortment of very thick soldiers, open the
the star gate. They find themselves on an Earth-like planet inhabited by
ancient Egyptians. It seems an alien life force came to Earth to escape
catastrophe, assumed human form, turned itself into the Sun God Ra,
taught the ancient Egyptians how to do amazing things, and then
transported lots of them through the gate to this planet as slaves. Jaye
Davidson of Crying Game fame, sporting an assortment of very pretty
frocks, plays the alien, more Mince the Magnificent than Ming.
Russell and Spader have some entertaining adventures, and the special
effects are good, but there is no story in which to take an interest.
Nothing that happens thereafter lives up to the promise of that superb
first half-hour and the result, a kind of extraterrestrial King
Solomon's Mines, is definitely not another Star Trek.
Best film of the week, one of the best we shall see all year, Louis
Malle's Vanya on 42nd Street (U), contains one moment of pure celluloid
magic. This record of a production of Uncle Vanya directed by Andre
Gregory, which he had been rehearsing with some actor friends as an
acting exercise for years, was shot by Malle in the derelict New
Amsterdam Theatre over a two-week period.
It opens with the actors turning up for another ''performance''. We
meet them in the street, follow them into the theatre, watch them take
off their street clothes, have a coffee, settle down to chat, and then
the conversation between two of them, Larry Pine, all raddled
matinee-idol good looks, and Lynn Cohen, seamlessly turns into one
between Dr Astrov and the old Nurse. Real life becomes the play. It is a
breathtaking moment, cinema used as it should be, and there is not a
special effect in sight.
Wallace Shawn's Vanya is impressive in spite of there being something
too comic, too lightweight about his personality for the role. The
women, however, are perfectly cast. Julianne Moore, gorgeously sexy and
sad, is the haunted Yelena wooed by both Vanya and Astrov, while Brooke
Smith, although far from plain, makes the hapless Sonya one of life's
natural victims. The forceful, colloquial translation is by David
Mammet.
Roger Avery's Killing Zoe (18) has Quentin Tarantino as one of its
executive producers, probably the only reason for giving it anything
other than a video release here since it is over a year old. A
thoroughly nasty little film, it stars Eric Stoltz, an actor who should
know better, as an American thief called Zed who goes to Paris at the
invitation of an old friend called Eric, Jean-Hugues Anglade, to help
his gang rob a bank.
On his arrival his taxi-driver suggests a wife for the night. Zoe
(Julie Delpy) turns up at Zed's hotel-room door and proves a whore with
a heart. She falls in love with her jet-lagged trick, only to be thrown
out when Eric arrives, and takes him off for a night of debauchery round
the cellars of Paree doing drugs with his fellow robbers.
The next day, high as kites, they attack the bank at which Zoe has a
day job as a teller. An orgy of unpleasant violence follows as things
spiral out of control. Avery worked in the same video store as Tarantino
and co-wrote True Romance and Pulp Fiction. On this evidence one would
not know because he does not have Tarantino's way with violence.
Some films should be avoided at all costs. This is one of them. One
watches, but that is about all one can say in its favour. The acting is
minimal.
There is violence in plenty in Hal Hartley's quirky, utterly charming
Amateur (15), but it is violence used for a moral purpose, not there
just to stimulate jaded palates. A man (Martin Donovan) is found lying
unconscious in a New York street by a young woman (Elina Lowenstein).
She runs away. He awakes and goes to a coffee shop where he meets
Isobelle Huppert, an ex-nun trying to earn a living writing pornography,
who claims to be a nymphomaniac, although she is also a virgin. How can
that be? She is fussy.
This odd couple -- he is suffering from amnesia -- fall slowly in
love. But who is the man? Why are people looking for him? It turns out
he is a vicious, evil, crooked pornographer pushed from the window by
the young woman who ran away, whom he had debauched and turned into a
notorious blue-movie star.
Hartley's films tend to meander. This one moves briskly and poses all
sorts of fascinating questions about human nature and personality. As an
amnesiac the man is kind and and gentle. With his wits he is depraved
and cruel. Which is the real man? The crook or the amnesiac.
The nun too has tried to change, to become something she is not and
cannot be, while the wife, also trying to escape her grimy world, cannot
resist attempting to make some money. She tries to sell some of his
tapes to some business associates of her husband and her inept double
dealing leads to death.
There are moments to treasure in Nostradamus (15), a truly terrible
life of the great sixteenth-century seer, notably the credit announcing
that Rutger Hauer is ''The Mystic Monk''. Not a fun person, Nostradamus
kept foreseeing disasters -- or clips from the BFI newsreel library. He
seems to have had a blind spot when it came to this film, however.

Items of indispensable smart knowledge.
IT'S a bold man who takes on the toy giants and wins. But that's just
what American Joel Glickman did. At a wedding reception six years ago
Joel was bored and ended up playing with drinking straws. He came up
with a wonderful invention -- a toy construction system to rival Meccano
and Lego (still the brand leader in the multi-million dollar UK
construction toy market). So, K'nex was born.
Glickman trawled the toy manufacturers looking for a deal to no avail.
He finally put his idea into production at his own expense and took it
direct to the toy stores. After an astronomically-successful first year,
and a host of ''best toy'' awards, the toy companies began to take
notice. Earlier last year, Glickman signed a lucrative international
deal with toy giant Hasbro.
By 1992 K'nex was the biggest Christmas seller at Toys ''R'' Us, the
American toy store chain. And now K'nex (called the toy construction
game of the nineties) is available in Britain.
Each set has a variety of colour-coded pieces -- rods, pulleys,
connectors, wheels and corner sections which snap together. ''There's
maths, logic, physics, and geometry involved, the kids pick up that as
they play,'' says Joel. It is also easy to add working parts like
winches or elastic band ''engines''. The K'nex slogan is ''if you can
imagine it, you can build it''.
The permutations of what children can build is virtually limitless --
from carousels to spaceships, tractors to windmills. Each set comes with
a book full of fun projects for all age groups from six upwards. Parents
will also be glad to hear that the K'nex pieces come in their own sturdy
storage box -- no small consideration when the largest kit contains 1800
pieces.
Another advantage of K'nex is that projects can be large, height does
not limit the construction rigidity. ''We've built cranes that are 10
feet in height with an eight-foot boom,'' says Glickman.
Many parents and educators have been worried about the advent of the
interactive video game and CD-ROM rotting the brains of children. Are
construction sets old-fashioned and on the way out? Glickman thinks not:
''Kids are coming back from the screens. Kids are naturally creative. At
a recent toy fair there were all the free video games they could play,
but then they would come to look at K'nex and play with it for hours.''
Joel Glickman, who studied fine arts and has his own injection-moulded
plastics company, always knew that a high-quality plastic, manufactured
to precise specifications, would mean success. K'nex can be snapped
together and taken apart almost endlessly without loss of play value.
* K'nex is available in all good toy shops.

LOOKING through my 1995 calendar, aside from Old Camperdown and I
celebrating our silver wedding in June, I note that the coming year is
filled with anniversaries. It is 700 years since King John Balliol of
Scotland and King Philip of France formed the Auld Alliance whereby, for
a time, citizens of the two countries enjoyed dual citizenship.
In 1695, John Holland, an Englishman, founded the Bank of Scotland, a
year after William Paterson, a Scotsman, founded the Bank of England (I
note that nobody is commemorating Paterson's initiation of the Darien
Scheme, also 1695). And 250 years ago, on July 23, 1745, Prince Charles
Edward Stuart arrived on the Isle of Eriskay commencing the second
Jacobite Uprising.
Major Brian Leishman, one of my old dancing partners, tells me that
the first and last of these anniversaries are to be celebrated at this
year's Edinburgh Military Tattoo, of which he is commercial director. At
the same time, I'm informed that Brigadier Melville Jameson,
Camperdown's dapper chum from the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, whose
family home is at Blairgowrie, has been appointed to succeed Major
Michael Parker as the tattoo's producer.
I was terribly pleased to hear this news as I've always thought Mel an
absolute genius ever since he was just a young officer in the Royal
Scots Greys and had the idea of mixing up military brass and pipe bands
to record that wonderful version of Amazing Grace. Many was the night
Camperdown and I would sit and listen to this, holding hands in front of
the fire in the great hall of the castle after dinner, humming along to
the music as we sipped our Glenmorangie. I can't wait to see what Mel
might dream up for the tattoo in August.
Back in the very early 70s, Mel's lovely wife, the former Sarah Walker
Munro, used to cook lunches for Richard Demarco, that entrepreneurial
Italian Scot, when he had his art gallery in Edinburgh's Melville
Crescent. I imagine the name Melville must now be as significant for her
when she finds herself in Edinburgh as Camperdown is for me when I visit
Dundee.
As you probably know, Camperdown is a bit of a Burns buff and, if I
might say so, nobody, but nobody, can begin to equal the old boy's
rendition of A Man's A Man For A' That, which has become his party piece
at the many Burns Suppers he is called upon to address. For my part, I
have, on occasion, been complimented for my reply on behalf of the
lassies, although in no way can I be said to compete with Lady Dunpark
-- the widow of the late law lord -- who lives in Edinburgh, and who is
famous in the Burns context for her inimitable rejoinder: ''His sins
were scarlet, but his books were read!''
On Thursday next, Camperdown and I have been invited, quite out of the
blue, by John C Struthers, to a Burns International Festival launch
dinner being held at the Moat House International, Glasgow. The purpose
of this party, which promises to be quite an extravaganza, is to kick
off a whole series of events commemorating the poet's death 200 years
ago. According to the promotional leaflet, the focus of these activities
will be in the south west of Scotland -- ''the peaceful rural Eden of
Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire which gave life and livelihood to the man,
shaping his attitudes and work''.
One must observe, however, that the idea of world-wide satellite
links, recitals, concerts, a son et lumiere, mini festivals and rock and
pop, does all sound rather commercially led. It does seem a long way
from our modest little local celebration in the village hall where Bobby
Williams-Busby, our factor, addresses the haggis, Ochiltree, the head
keeper, recites Tam O'Shanter from memory, and Dawkins, our chauffeur,
and Mrs Paterson, our housekeeper, sing Ae Fond Kiss together in a duet
which brings tears to the eyes.
Don't misunderstand me, one does feel it only right to make a fuss
about Robert Burns, but considering he died in July 1796, one can't help
feeling that next week's do does seem a little premature. That aside,
I'm very much looking forward to re-encountering one of my great
pin-ups, John Cairney. I was devastated when I was told that he and
Alanna O'Sullivan, his pretty actress wife, had moved permanently to
live in New Zealand. Do you know, I've never understood why they didn't
make a film about Burns with John in the leading role when he was young
enough to play it.  But then I suppose they didn't make one about
Shakespeare either.
Also entertaining us on Thursday will be Peggy O'Keefe, Elaine C
Smith, and Mary Sandeman, who sings all those Gaelic songs so sweetly,
and is a great heroine of Mrs Bogie, our cook, who herself once won a
silver medal at the Mod.
I'm sure it was she who dressed up in a kimono and momentarily back in
the 70s topped the pops with a record about some Japanese chap (Mary,
that is, not Mrs Bogie), but the old boy says I'm talking nonsense.
Infuriatingly, I spent most of yesterday up in the attic rummaging
through old singles trying to prove him wrong. Sometimes I do so wish we
hadn't gone over to compact discs!

AYEAR ago Sandra Begg was making casts and one-off planters and pots
based on gargoyles and mythological figures. A lot of her time and
energy was spent in the casting and moulding process, although she
wanted to devote herself to more creative work.
Now she has sold the rights to some of her most popular designs so
that, while somebody else concentrates on ''mass production,'' she is
free to work on new sculptures.
''I was at a craft fair and my stall was really busy. Someone came
over and we struck a deal,'' she says. She confesses that having someone
take over the manufacture has not meant a huge influx of extra cash.
Many craftspeople are not in the business to make a fortune, but do it
for the enjoyment and, hopefully, remain self-sufficient.
Last winter, Judith Bell was selling novelty polar fleece hats shaped
like those worn by the king, queen and jack on playing cards. The hats
proved popular, especially among the exuberant ski crowd. Now she's
enjoying another season selling mainly through travelling craft fairs
organised by the Northern Craft Fair Organisation (NCFO).
The image of crafts has changed over the past 10 years. The line
between craft and design is more blurred than ever. ''Arty crafty'' no
longer connotes earth mothers making corn dollies as couthy ''home
handicrafts'' are being edged out.
Richard Green, who runs the NCFO, is committed to expanding the appeal
of good design and craft in Scotland. He vets merchandise which sells at
his fairs.
''My general feeling is that for Scottish craftworkers, takings are
down on last year by about 15-30%, but I don't think they're going down
any more,'' he says. ''Of course, some people buck the trend because
they're making something people want, or are just being more
efficient.''
As conflicting reports about the green shoots of recovery continue,
the recession is still a factor. Around the end of 1992, many
wholesalers and retailers began cutting back on their buying and this
had a knock-on effect for individual craftspeople.
There are signs that this caution is lessening. The annual Highland
Trade Fair held in Aviemore was the best attended of recent years.
Exhibitors were up by 10% and the profile of international buyers had
also risen.

THE next time someone accuses me of being technophobic or even
Luddite, I am going to hand them a copy of an American magazine called
Child (now available in Scotland) and see if, after reading it, they
don't feel like smashing every video machine and home computer in sight.
Although it claims to be ''the essential guide for today's parents'',
a thorough examination of this glossy publication leaves you in no doubt
that Child is little more than an advertising vehicle for the makers of
a bewildering range of electronic entertainment and software, all of it
promising to ''introduce your child to a whole new world of creativity
and fun''.
Alphi the Robot will ''talk kids into learning''. Winnie the Pooh and
Thomas the Tank Engine videos will ''give your kids the gift of play''
and ''entertain your child with important life lessons'' while Tiger
electronic games ''offer kids a real sense of achievement'' because they
are ''designed to meet their educational and emotional needs''.
In the world of Child magazine's advertisers, electronic nurturing can
begin virtually at birth with ''interactive, developmental and fun''
videos which ''engage baby from two months''. Its Sleepy Time includes
an audio tape of lullabies ''to establish a restful mood'' while Potty
Time allegedly makes toilet training so much fun that children simply
''beg to watch it''. (Not forgetting the latest CD-ROM blockbuster What
is a Bellybutton?)
There's even a video which shows kids how to bake bread and an
electronic doll which can ''teach your baby to talk and talk and talk''
-- good grief!
But why wait until the baby is born before plugging him or her into
electronic technology? Using something called an embryonic subjective
education device, you can ''increase your child's learning ability by 20
to 25%'' while it's still in the womb.
The message from the manufacturers of this electronic gadgetry is
clear: you can have your cake and eat it. You can have kids and work
endless overtime to pay for the stylish accessories, all advertised in
Child, that go with them -- like a glossy mini-van with concealed
storage bins, individual cup holders, leather upholstery and fold-down
seats; the Ralph Lauren cashmere romper suit, at #130, and an essential
#500 worth of baby travel gear . . . provided, that is, you load up the
family VCR and home computer with the appropriate videos and software.
The message to lazy, inadequate or selfish adults (hands up) is
equally clear: why spend time ''parenting'' when there is a piece of
technology ''designed by experts who know how kids learn and what makes
them tick'' which can do the job better than any ordinary mum or dad?
The editorial content of Child, so seamlessly interwoven with the
glossy ads that you can hardly tell where one begins and the other ends,
tells quite a different story.
A host of psychologists speak out against parents who ''spend more
time on their jobs or special interests than with their children''.
They warn ''don't let new toys be stand-ins for what your child really
wants -- your love and attention''.
In their opinion, ''children need lots of one-on-one interaction with
parents or other caring adults and lots of hugs, warmth and
communication''.
They reckon that reading to your child from good, old-fashioned books
and playing simple board games with them is far more beneficial than
hours spent in front of a flickering screen.
''Television,'' say the American experts ''is no substitute for you.''
Britain, of course, has its own home-grown range of magazines devoted
to child-rearing. Parents is one and, glad to report, it's a much more
down to earth, low-key publication, with advertisements geared to the
necessities of life such as nappies, push chairs, and cough medicine
rather than rampant consumerism.
Interestingly, though, there are a greater number of adverts in the
British magazine for products which deal with the more negative aspects
of early parenthood, such as tension headaches and sleepless nights. It
seems that, on this side of the Atlantic, we're inclined to reach for
the medicine bottle to cope with infant wakefulness. In America,
presumably, they just plug in the computer.

Is Glasgow's recovery grinding to a halt because surrounding
communities are better placed to attract jobs?
SEVERAL hundred businessmen and women gathered in Glasgow this week to
hear an upbeat message about the city's prospects. The occasion was the
launch of a glossy new publication called Metropolitan Glasgow, compiled
by Insider Publications for Glasgow Development Agency and Glasgow City
Council. It describes in glowing terms how ''Glasgow has undergone one
of the most radical restructurings ever faced by any local economy''.
Emphasis is firmly on good news and the message to foreign and British
companies is that Glasgow is the place to be.
As a marketing effort it was impressive but it tells only half the
story. One of those quoted in Metropolitan Glasgow, Steve Inch, head of
economic development for the city council, was telling the other half
late last year when he gave evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into UK
regional policy.
The submission represented a damning indictment of regional policy as
it operates in Scotland. Its main claim is that Glasgow is failing to
attract new investment and is losing existing companies to surrounding
enterprise zones and new towns which are able to offer bigger
incentives. And this is despite the fact that Glasgow still suffers from
a number of complex and intractable problems.
These include the city's unemployment rate which has been consistently
higher than all other surrounding districts added together. The biggest
headache is the large number of middle-aged men out of work. Last July
male registered unemployment in Glasgow District was 37,000, the
capacity of Hampden Park. In 1991, 45,000 fewer people (the capacity of
the new Ibrox) were employed full time in Glasgow than a decade before.
At the same time the level of grant payments through the Government's
Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) scheme has been lower on a per
capita basis than in surrounding districts.
In addition, there has been a dramatic contraction in the city's
manufacturing base, which is forecast to continue.
Steve Inch's case to the Industry Select Committee was that Glasgow
can't tackle the weaknesses in its local economy without a bigger share
of the Government's regional assistance cake. ''Regional policy itself
is not flawed but all sorts of other things have come into place,'' said
Inch. The two which most concern him are enterprise zones and new towns.
The range of special-assistance programmes they can offer is damaging
Glasgow, he said. MPs were told that to add insult to injury Scottish
Office agencies, such as Locate In Scotland, appeared to ''steer''
inward investors to locations outwith Glasgow unless they were in the
service sector.
The Scottish Office vigorously refutes this, as does Scottish
Enterprise. ''Companies coming to Scotland often want to locate on
greenfield sites with room for expansion,'' said a Scottish Office
spokesman. ''We don't force anyone to go anywhere. We look at what they
need to do their business but the final decision rests with them,'' said
Scottish Enterprise, which runs LIS.
Inch is not convinced: ''We're sure there's a degree of preferential
treatment for new towns and enterprise zones. ''In Lanarkshire, it's
factory accommodation built or underwritten, with tax incentives and
rent holidays. In the new towns it's high-quality accommodation at
competitive prices. If Fuji comes along, LIS won't plug Glasgow.'' is
particularly galling is that three of the four sites currently being
promoted by Glasgow Regeneration Alliance, a partnership between GDA,
GDC, Strathclyde, and Scottish Homes, are greenfield.
Glasgow is not only failing to attract inward investment beyond the
service sector, it is also continuing to lose the few manufacturing
companies left here. Heatovent, which exports its heaters throughout the
world, was based in Glasgow for over 50 years. Last year it moved to
East Kilbride.
Chairman Tom Duffy said: ''We were desperate to relocate in Glasgow
but they were unable to come across with the sort of package we needed.
As soon as we told Lanarkshire Development Agency, it was on our
doorstep, giving us information about every factory of the size and
shape we were looking for. Once we found what we wanted in East Kilbride
the development corporation there helped us get a #300,000 RSA grant.
Glasgow couldn't compete. I know of at least another seven firms who
have moved out of Glasgow for the same reason.'' Since moving to East
Kilbride, Heatovent has increased its turnover by #800,000 and taken on
35 more employees.
This uneven playing-field is not the only problem with Government
regional policy, according to the GDC.
''As a Development Area, the whole of the Glasgow Travel to Work Area
(TTWA), of which Glasgow District is a part, benefits from the highest
levels of Government assistance to industry,'' said the Scottish Office
spokesman. Inch believes that the whole TTWA concept is flawed because
it is too big and fails to take account of weaknesses in the public
transport network.
''You can't expect somebody from Easterhouse to work in Cumbernauld
when the only way to get there by bus is via the city centre,'' said
Inch. ''More emphasis needs to be placed on creating employment in
places accessible to the unemployed,'' he told the committee.
Secondly, derelict land is a growing problem in Glasgow. It is being
created at twice the rate of being cleared up. Yet while a dedicated
land renewal agency (English Partnerships) is tackling this problem in
the South, Scottish Enterprise has been running down its commitment to
treating derelict land. The Scottish Office pointed out that #9m is
being made available to GDA to clear brownfield sites for housing in the
next three years but Inch said this money should also be available for
industrial sites.
Thirdly, GDC told the committee that there seemed to be a much clearer
focus on cities in England and Wales. By contrast, the Scottish Office
and its agencies seem to regard Glasgow as ''a post-industrial,
service-based city facing an inevitable decline as a location for
manufacturing activity''. Scottish Office policy is accelerating this
decline, according to GDC's submission. If this is the case, Glasgow --
with decreasing employment and falling population -- is bucking the
European trend towards re-urbanisation. And what of GDA's grandiose
vision of Glasgow at the top of Europe's second division of major
cities?
I put this to the Scottish Office. This was their somewhat cryptic
reply: ''No discrimination is made between inner and outer areas across
the Glasgow TTWA. In five years to September 30, 1994, 179 offers of RSA
worth #57m have been accepted by companies in Glasgow District. Over
#10m of these were to 37 companies in Central Glasgow with post codes G1
to G4.''

Jennifer Cunningham reports how the disabled lobby is gearing up for
protest over a 'half-measure' Bill
DISCRIMINATION against disabled people is the sort of emotive, social
issue on which the electorate expects MPs to vote according to
conscience. Since it is not that simple, the wheelchairs of protest will
be rolling again next month. In every city in Britain, most noticeably
outside Parliament, thousands of people whose lives are affected by a
physical or mental disability will congregate to claim their rights to
an unfettered chance of a job or an education or just a viewing of the
latest blockbuster film.
Lawrence Nugent will be protesting from his wheelchair in the centre
of Glasgow on February 9. A construction worker for most of his 53
years, he now works with the Glasgow Coalition of Disabled People.
Increasingly restricted by spinal arthritis over the past 10 years, he
says: ''I've been thrown on the scrapheap. I could do office work, but
no-one wants to know. Discrimination is a way of life. Officials need
more training to deal with disabled people. I was offered a house on the
11th floor of a multi-storey.''
This week's attempt by the Government to placate the disabled lobby
without unleashing even more powerful protest from employers is shaping
up to be another vote-loser.
Britain's thirteenth attempt to introduce anti-discrimination
legislation on behalf of disabled people last summer added one more
banana skin to the pile which toppled Government Ministers.
More importantly, the practical effect of the hoohah about Lady Olga
Maitland and the Minister Nicholas Scott, being discovered to have
misled the House was that the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill
introduced by Dr Roger Berry ran out of time and disabled people still
had no recourse against discrimination.
This week the new Minister for Disabled People, William Hague,
introduced a Disability Discrimination Bill. It proposes to make it
illegal for employers of more than 20 people to discriminate against
disabled people and requires shops, restaurants, pubs and cinemas to
spend between 5% and 10% of their rateable value in making ''reasonable
adjustments'' to provide disabled people with access to their premises.
So far, so good, but the Opposition is crying foul and the disabled
lobby is revving up for protest.
Politically, it is a question of timing. The Second Reading of the
Government's Disability Discrimination Bill is scheduled for January 24.
On February 10, a Private Member's Bill dealing with civil rights for
disabled people, introduced by Labour back-bencher Harry Barnes, is due
for its Second Reading. It is largely a resurrection of the Bill which
was scuttled by the Government last year. Most significantly, it
proposes the establishment of a commission which would have a remit to
end discriminatory practices comparable to those of the Equal
Opportunities Commission and the Race Relations Board, with the same
powers to back individuals who wanted to take cases to tribunals. The
Hague proposals would instead establish a Disability Council, which
would be an advisory body and not an enforcing one.
Harry Barnes sees the Government's proposals as a deliberate
half-measure. ''Their Bill defines disabled people in specifically
limited terms. For example, they must expect to be disabled for a
minimum of a 12-month period and only certain illnesses count as
disabling. It also lists specific areas in which less favourable
treatment is actually allowed. This Bill contains whole waves of
exemptions; it is very limited in scope -- yet we are talking about
something which affects 10% of the population.
''My Bill would establish full civil rights for disabled people. There
must be procedures to give the legislation its own dynamism and a
Disability Rights Commission to ensure that rights can be enforced. The
Government is proposing to establish an advisory Disability Council, but
the person given the role of advisor would be the Social Security
Minister. It would be far from an independent commission, three-quarters
of whose members would be disabled and whose very existence would roll
back the boundaries,'' he said.
The evidence from the previous attempts shows that in a free vote, his
civil rights Bill would receive a majority in both Houses. Can the two
sides get together? Tom Clarke, Shadow Minister for Disabled People,
will put it to the Shadow Cabinet next week that they should not oppose
Hague's Bill, on the principle that half a loaf is better than none.
Harry Barnes has not yet given up hope that his strong hand will
extract more from the Minister, with whom he wants a meeting before
January 24.
''We have support not only from the Labour Party but from a wide
grouping of Opposition parties. The sponsors include Margaret Ewing of
the SNP and Dafydd Wigley of Plaid Cymru -- it also has cross-party
support among the Northern Ireland MPs. Barnes's Conservative sponsor,
Richard Body, is one of those currently without the whip. A number of
Tories who supported Roger Berry's Bill which was scuttled last summer
have held back from committing themselves to Barnes, because they had
been attempting to influence the Government's own Bill. It is not yet
clear how many of them will be satisfied by the Hague proposals, but the
party arithmetic is different this time.''
The figure of #17 billion claimed by the Government and some employers
as being required to implement the Civil Rights Bill is scorned by Tom
Clarke. He said: ''We are not expecting miracles. We are not saying that
every building in the land has to be accessible within five years. We
want all new buildings and all modernisation of old buildings to include
wheelchair access and have other aids, for example for deaf people,
where appropriate. Many changes require very little.''

THE fate of Mr David Blair, the suspended chief executive of Lochaber
District Council, will not be known until next week, despite the
council's disciplinary sub-committee spending 11 hours hearing his case
on Thursday.
An announcement had been expected at noon yesterday, but the committee
issued a statement saying it was seeking further clarification on a
number of points of evidence presented at this week's meeting and at the
earlier meeting on December 16.
Council chairman Mr Neil Clark said yesterday that, once these matters
had been considered, an announcement would be made on Tuesday or
Wednesday.
Mr Blair was suspended in September following a report from the
council's internal auditors on council contracts dating back five years.
The report does not point to financial irregularities but is thought to
concentrate on Mr Blair's management regime.

A SHERIFF yesterday told a schoolboy who made dirty telephone calls to
female classmates and sent them obscene letters that he would like to
send him to jail but could not under present legislation.
Scott Fleming, 17, of Strathmore Drive, Cornton, Stirling, admitted 13
charges of making silent and obscene telephone calls and seven of
sending condoms and pictures of a penis through the post.
Sheriff Colin Stein placed Fleming on probation for two years and said
he was prevented from jailing him because he had been charged with
statutory offences, rather than with breach of the peace.
The sheriff told depute fiscal Lorraine Glancy: ''I wonder if in
future consideration would be given to bringing charges of this sort
under the common law offence of breach of the peace, whereby the full
range of disposals are made available to the court.''
Miss Glancy said Fleming, now at university, was caught when police
set up wire taps on the phones of some of his victims, all fifth-year
pupils.
Stirling Sheriff Court heard he telephoned seven girls and made
photocopies of a penis and sent them and the condoms to five girls. Miss
Glancy said Fleming's campaign took place between May and July last
year.
Sheriff Colin Stein was given a letter from one of the girls, who said
she was so upset by Fleming's calls that she failed one of her Highers.
Defence agent Mr John Barr said most of the calls were made during ''a
three-week period of shameless and disgraceful behaviour by a young man
who had never been in any bother before''. He said there was no
psychological explanation.
''He found himself in a cycle of behaviour and couldn't get out. He
was pleased to be caught before he could cause further distress and
upset to people,'' said Mr Barr.

<TEXT>
A HIGHLAND musician, who severed a finger in a gardening accident last
year, has dedicated his first album to a doctor for saving his career.
Nairn solicitor Mr Ian Hardie, 42, is a well-known fiddle player in
Scottish folk circles, having played solo and for groups including Jock
Thamson's Bairns on TV and radio.
However, last summer he thought his fiddling had come to an end when
he sliced off the third finger of his left hand while cutting a hedge
with an electric trimmer.
Mr Hardie said: ''It is the most important finger to a fiddler. I
couldn't believe my own stupidity. I thought my life was over. I love
playing the fiddle and I couldn't imagine life without it.
''The finger was just hanging there by a piece of skin. Fortunately, I
had the presence of mind to plunge it into a bag of ice and I drove
round to the nearby hospital.
''The finger was sewn back on by Dr Morag Maclean and her staff at the
Town and County Hospital in Nairn. Her skills ensured my skills survived
and I owe her a tremendous debt of gratitude.
''Therefore, I have dedicated the album to her as a token of my
thanks.''
The album, by trio Highland Connection, which is released on CD and
cassette today, was recorded at Phil Cunningham's studios, near Beauly,
outside Inverness.
Recording had to be delayed for two months until Mr Hardie regained
the dexterity required for playing. It was due to be finished last July
but the accident put back completion to September.
The basis of the album, Gaining Ground, is a suite of music composed
for Ross and Cromarty District Council for a music exhibition in 1993.
But other self-compositions have been added by Mr Hardie and his
colleagues, Janice Clark, of North Kessock, and ''Dagger'' Gordon,
formerly with the group Black Donald.
Dr Maclean was unavailable for comment yesterday. She has moved from
local practice in the Nairn area and is believed to be preparing for a
trip to South Africa.

<HEADLINE>Super quarry 'would undermine micro-algae plan'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980369622</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MICRO-ALGAE development by an international drug company could be a
''sunrise'' industry which would put the Western Isles at the forefront
of chemical technology.
However, the presence of a #70m coastal super quarry proposed for
Lingerbay -- with risks of pollution from ballast water -- would rule
out a Harris development which could provide up to 60 jobs.
This was stated yesterday by Dr David Horrobin, chief executive of
Scotia Pharmaceuticals, which already operates a factory at Callanish in
Lewis.
He was giving evidence on the 37th day of the public inquiry at
Stornoway into the super quarry proposal by Redland Aggregate at
Lingerbay which is in a national scenic area.
Dr Horrobin told the chief inquiry Reporter his company spent #14m
annually on research and development.
He explained that one of the raw materials Scotia used for
pharmaceutical manufacture was fish oil. It now had to import that from
South America, Thailand, and South Africa but supplies were beginning to
fail. It was thought that within five to 10 years there may well be no
fish oil industry left.
He said Scotia extracted from the oils two compounds known as
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DNA). Its
Callanish factory, which employed 40, used the pure EPA and DHA to make
a range of different drug substances.
Dr Horrobin told the inquiry EPA and DHA were not made by the fish but
derived from the food chain. Even plankton did not make EPA and DHA.
They got these chemicals by eating plant-like organisms called
micro-algae which required no feeding.
He added: ''Thus, if the marine micro-algae could be cultured in large
quantities, then Scotia could by-pass the whole food chain. Scotia has
linked up with a French company, Heliosynthese, which is expert in
micro-algae and their culture. The two companies are funding a joint
research programme which is in three phases, each of which will take two
to three years.''
There would be two pilot plants, one probably in the Western Isles,
and one in France. Each site would employ five to 10 people. If the
projects were successful, they would proceed to full-scale plants.
Each would employ between 20 and 60 staff.
Dr Horrobin said Scotia was looking for a site separate from Callanish
because they deliberately did not allow their sites to grow too large.
He said: ''We would like to set up an operation in Harris. We are an
international company. We will proceed with the development whether the
quarry goes ahead or not. If the quarry goes ahead, we would not put our
plant in Harris or the Western Isles. We are aware of all the assurances
about this but any risk for us is too great. We are being actively
pursued by the government of New Zealand and Tasmania.''
Under cross-examination by Mr Roy Martin, QC, for Redland's, Dr
Horrobin said: ''We believe a super quarry is not an appropriate
development for the Western Isles because we believe it will have a
disastrous economic impact on the Western Isles.''
He said he was aware of the proposed car ferry service between
Leverburgh and North Uist and that would also have an effect on the
choice of site.
The inqiry resumes on Tuesday when there will be evidence on the third
topic which will deal with the social and economic effects of the
planning application.

* THIS is a true story. I was in New York city 18 months ago on
holiday and got on a bus going downtown, as they say. After seating
ourselves, my daughter pointed to a sign stating that if a wheelchair
passenger got on the bus, we must move.
The notion that anyone in a wheelchair would try to get on a bus in a
place like New York seemed preposterous. After all, I'd seen how even
elderly people and mums with pushchairs can be treated on the buses in
one of the friendliest cities in the world (that's Glasgow, by the way).
I could just imagine how bus drivers in the Big (Bad) Apple would react
if someone in a wheelchair tried to flag them down. And, anyway, how
would they get a wheelchair on to a bus in the first place?
I had hardly finished reassuring my daughter that we would not need to
move -- the notice was obviously a sop for the disabled lobby -- when
the bus stopped and the driver appeared at my side. I caught the words
''Wheelchair passenger, you'll have to move'', and then gawped as he
opened the exit doors in the middle of the vehicle and pressed a button
which transformed the steps into a lift which brought the wheelchair
passenger level with the doorway.
The driver flipped up the seats we had vacated and secured the chair
with clips. The procedure took about five minutes, and I didn't detect a
sigh or grimace from either driver or passengers during the operation.
It seemed that a wheelchair on a bus was an everyday occurrence in
Manhattan, or had we stumbled on the city's one and only specially
adapted public transport vehicle?
Apparently not. When an Edinburgh woman, Katie Widdowson, visited New
York recently with her brother, who is confined to a wheelchair, they
found the city so accessible to the disabled that Andrew experienced
more freedom than he had since breaking his neck in a rugby accident
over a decade ago.
Katie said: ''All the buses in Manhattan have wheelchair spaces and it
was a form of transport we used the whole time we were there. It's a
great way to see the city.''
A spokesman for the New York-based Society for the Advancement of
Travel for the Handicapped said that since the introduction of the
American Disability Act of 1990 it has become a legal obligation in the
United States for new public transport vehicles to be fitted with access
for the disabled.
''In Manhattan itself,'' he added, ''an increasing number of subway
stations are also being adapted for disabled use.''

A FIVE-YEAR-OLD girl was fighting for life after undergoing the latest
in a series of liver transplants. Tamara Rainey, from Belfast, underwent
the 10-hour operation at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. ''She's a
real fighter, it's amazing she's come through this,'' said her mother,
Marina. Tamara underwent the first of her transplants in October 1990.
She was well enough to start school last September but soon afterwards
her health deteriorated and doctors decided she needed another liver. In
the previous operations, she was given a cut-down organ but this time
she received a whole liver which is believed to have come from a
four-year-old.

A LORRY loaded with live calves was turned away from Swansea Airport
yesterday after animal rights protesters crawled under its wheels.
One man chained his neck to the axle while others climbed on to the
roof of the cab in a bid to stop the 150 animals being flown to Europe
in the latest demonstration against live animal exports. Police pulled
protesters from beneath the lorry after it was stopped on a main road
500 yards from the airport's main gates.
Animal rights campaigners claimed a victory when the lorry turned away
to return the animals to the Welsh farm they had come from. The
protesters pledged to continue their 24-hour vigil at the main gates of
the airport, as a Russian-owned transporter plane stayed on the tarmac.
The Farmers' Union of Wales is planning to transport live calves to
the Continent from Swansea in an agreement with an Irish export firm.
The move follows the ban on live animal exports by leading ferry firms
which came into effect in the autumn.
The lorry turned away yesterday after Mr Gareth Wardell, the Labour MP
for Gower, West Glamorgan, stepped in to negotiate for both sides at the
scene of the dispute.
Mr Wardell, who has called for the FUW to scrap its plans, said:
''This is a huge victory for the protesters and for the good common
sense of the owner of the animals.''
Protesters fed the calves with bottled water as the lorry blocked
traffic on the main road leading to the airport. Police moved in to pull
them from under the lorry as the blockade became deadlocked.
No fresh attempt to transport the calves was planned yesterday, but
the FUW said the plan to fly animals from Wales will go ahead.
Meanwhile, animal exporters will be able to keep British calves out of
Dutch veal crates under a new scheme announced last night.
Dutch meat industry chiefs said they would guarantee to send imported
British calves only to farms where they have room to forage.
The move, announced by the Meat and Livestock Commission, which said
it had been pressing its Dutch counterparts to do more to keep British
calves out of crates.
''They have guaranteed that all 180,000 calves exported annually from
Britain will be able to go into loose boxes if that is what the
exporters want,'' an MLC spokesman said.
The crates, where calves are kept chained in semi-darkness with no
room to turn, have been banned in Britain since 1990.
Earlier, Mr William Waldegrave, the Agriculture Minister, failed to
placate animal welfare lobbies despite voicing strong opposition to
European veal rearing practices.
At a Whitehall meeting, Compassion in World Farming, which has
organised the protests at Shoreham, demanded that Britain should
unilaterally ban export of calves to the notorious crate system.
However, Mr Waldegrave said such a move would fly in the face of
European law and insisted change must come through a European Union
accord.
Meanwhile, the Department of Transport said yesterday the
livestock-carrying plane which crashed in Coventry killing five people
was flying illegally.
The Air Algerie Boeing 737, leased by Phoenix Aviation to take calves
abroad for slaughter, should have had a department permit to carry
livestock. But the department said: ''No permit was applied for and the
Transport Secretary (Mr Brian Mawhinney) has asked for a full
investigation.''
Phoenix's flights from Coventry airport to Amsterdam and Rennes, in
northern France, had been stopped by Coventry City Council last
November. But Phoenix had obtained a High Court order which enabled
flights to start again in mid-November.
A Transport Department spokesman said: ''We were contacted by Coventry
airport in November and we told them and Air Algerie that a permit was
required. But no permit was applied and the Department was not aware
that flights had resumed.''
The department emphasised that the investigation into the matter was
completely separate from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry
into the crash on December 21.
The Air Algerie plane was returning from a calf-carrying mission to
Amsterdam when it hit an electricity pylon, clipped the roofs of houses,
and crashed into a field near Coventry airport.

As torrential rain continues America's Far West plunges into economic
chaos and personal tragedy. Ros Davidson reports on the growing
devastation.
WITH more heavy rain and thunder predicted for California, flood
damage in the Far West is almost certain to exceed $300m. Ten people
have been killed and thousands evacuated in the 10 days of torrential
rain that pummeled the state from the forests of southern Oregon to the
deserts of Palm Springs.
An estimated 3000 people are homeless as more storms approach from the
Pacific Ocean. Yesterday morning President Clinton expanded the number
of disaster areas to 34 counties, more than half of California, the
nation's most populous state.
But even with the federal reimbursement, taxpayers will probably have
to bail out the rest of the victims anyway. Many people are uninsured
for flooding because government and insurance officials simply do not
implement laws requiring it.
Flood preparation is also generally inadequate, as voters and
politicians think short-term to save money and taxes.
Swollen rivers started to rise again in California yesterday as
another storm hit the north, said news reports. According to preliminary
estimates, damages in the state's $20 billion agricultural industry are
extensive. Along with Florida and Texas, California is the country's
leading producer of fruit and vegetables. In one county alone, damaged
crops will cost $22.7m.
Orange County, already bankrupt because of risky investments of public
money, also lost between 50% and 80% of its strawberries.
Since January 3, news reports have focused on flooding in Los Angeles,
which has displaced movie stars and swamped the coastal town of Malibu
with mud. But the northern state has actually been harder hit -- and is
forecast to be drenched again with rain this weekend.
Resorts on the Russian River north of San Francisco were virtually
washed away. Vineyards in wine country of Napa Valley are sodden.
On Friday California's state capital, Sacramento in the northern
Central Valley, was facing severe flooding as another swollen river
crested in rain that continued to fall. Much of the Sacramento River,
the state's largest, has already flooded into the cradle of California's
multi-billion dollar agribusiness industry.
Near the Oregon border, authorities called in National Guard and
California Conservation Corps crews because of health hazards from
hundreds of sheep and dairy cattle that drowned in floods from the Eel
River. A major road was jammed yet again the same day by a rockslide
near Silicon Valley.
In San Francisco, the world's Aids capital, blood banks announced an
urgent blood shortage because donations were halted during the storms,
which also came during the yearly shortage of blood donations because of
flu and the holidays.
And another flash-flood and mudslide warning was issued yesterday by
the National Weather Service for the wine-producing Napa and Sonoma
Counties north of San Francisco. Although vines are now dormant and
mostly planted on slopes, soil may be washed away and the phylloxera
pest -- already ravaging the crop -- could be spread to more wineries.
Still, damage was also severe in the south. The city of Escondido
warned its 165,000 residents that drinking water is contaminated. The
main street in downtown Santa Barbara, a town of surfers and the rich,
is also still awash with water.
As the damage is assessed across the state, local and federal
officials are struggling with the beginnings of another flood -- of
requests for emergency reimbursement. Clinton's declaration of federal
disaster opens the way for low-interest federal loans and grants of up
to $100,000 to victims, a tiny amount in a region that has the highest
property values in the country.
Fewer than half of the buildings in some areas have flood insurance.
Only about 220,000 people in the entire state have such coverage, while
nationally fewer than one-fifth of the 11 million families who live in
threatened regions are covered.
The government has promised $5m in funding for flood-damaged roads,
which include the main north-south artery Highway 101 and the Pacific
Coast Highway in Malibu, Santa Barbara and at Bodega Bay north of San
Francisco. But some freeways even now are still being repaired from the
earthquakes in San Francisco in 1989 and Los Angeles in 1992.
As one sub-tropical storm after another hit California's 30 million
residents during the past 10 days, rainfall was 17in in Santa Barbara
and 13in in Malibu. Gusts reached nearly 100mph atop Mount Templeton
northwest of Los Angeles late this week.
Major freeways and airports were closed and power was cut from
hundreds of thousands of customers. At one point, 95,000 homes in Los
Angeles and 258,000 near San Francisco had no electricity.
The Golden State seems oddly disaster-prone, because of its size and
variety of territory. And Los Angeles, San Francisco and Silicon Valley
are also more newsworthy than most places subject to floods, quakes,
riots and forest fires.
Ironically, the storms hit as federal emergency chief James Witt was
visiting Los Angeles to discuss the recovery from the Northridge
earthquake a year ago, on January 17. State emergency officials were in
LA too, planning an anniversary conference.
Flooding is the most severe in California in nine years, but only the
worst in a year and a half for the entire country.
In 1993, the Mississippi River broke its banks in the Mid-West. ''The
floods caused about $300m worth of damage in 24 counties, and we believe
this disaster will exceed that,'' says Tom Mullins of the state Office
of Emergency Services.
Nine years ago northern California's floods along the Russian River
cost $374m and killed 11 people. But those floods were far more
localised. This week's are swamping large cities, freeways, vineyards
and farms.

In view of reported inaccuracies regarding Dr Banda's medical
qualifications it would seem important at a very difficult stage in this
old man's life to put the record straight.
Dr Banda graduated doctor of medicine (MD) at Meharry Medical College,
a black institution in Nashville, Tennessee, in May, 1937. This basic
American degree was not recognised as a qualification to practise in the
UK.
Early in 1938 he enrolled at the non-university college of medicine in
Edinburgh (there were also two such colleges in Glasgow, Anderson's and
St Mungo).
He was exempted from most lectures in view of his American
qualifications and was able to spend time reading, attending
demonstrations, and watching surgical operations by Sir John Fraser and
his colleagues.
During his three years in Edinburgh there was time also to develop
further his church and active political interests. In due course he was
awarded by examination the Scottish colleges' Triple diploma of LRCP
Edin, MRCS Edin, &amp; LRFPS Glasg, with its licence to practise in the UK.
George Hume mentions Banda being in his late eighties (January 9).
This is in line with the official Malawi Government's birth year of
1906, which is almost certainly erroneous. Banda himself has admitted to
1902 being ''more or less correct''.
His maternal uncle, the Rev Hanock Phiri, as well as two other old
men, who remembered Banda as a child living on the outskirts of Kasungu,
recalled back in 1968 that the 1898 Angoni rising at Fort Jameson not
far from Kasungu took place about the time of Banda's birth.
So he is unlikely to be 89, but possibly 93 and quite likely 96 or 97.

You report that embarrassed Edinburgh institutions and individuals
linked to Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda are endeavouring to distance
themselves from the one-time despot of Malawi (January 9).
Dr Todd (late of Renfrew and a former missionary doctor who died a few
years ago in his 94th year) employed Dr Banda as a locum in the early
1930s. He also employed a Dr Currie at the same time as a locum. The
latter became the medical officer of the leprosarium in Malawi about
1959 and while serving in the Colonial Service I used to visit Dr Currie
and his wife.
Dr Currie related how Dr Banda visted the leprosarium to open a new
addition to the building. All the staff were lined up to be introduced
to Dr Banda who shook hands with them all except Dr Currie whom he
ignored.
Dr Currie spoke to the Kamuzu later and reminded him that they both
served as locums under Dr Todd in Renfrew. Suddenly the face of Dr Banda
lit up and he recalled their meetings in the early 1930s.
As a schoolboy I remember seeing the Kamuzu doing his rounds on foot
in the 1930s. I also knew some white-faced Christians who slammed the
door in his face.
On my arrival in Nyasaland in 1959 I was surprised at the unpopularity
among the whites of the Church of Scotland and especially the then
Moderator (Lord George MacLeod).
It should also be noted that the Church of Scotland paid little or no
heed to the minority report submitted by the late Dr Robert Sheppard of
Lovelace (South Africa) which stated clearly that he did not think the
Africans of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland were fit to govern
themselves.
This minority report formed part of the Monckton Commission which
recommended the dissolution of the Central African Federation under Sir
Roy Welensky.
On my return to Nyasaland in 1963 I wrote to your paper warning of the
dangers ahead in Nyasaland. It is now past history and it has proved the
saying that the African in Africa, due to one-man-one-vote-majority
rule, was freed from the colonial and earthly yokes.
It should also be borne in mind that Dr Kamuzu Banda was trained in
Ghana by Nkrumah to govern Nyasaland. Both were prison graduates.
Nkrumah is now dead and his own countrymen were loath to allow his body
to be buried in Ghanaian soil. Dr Banda is now being treated in much the
same way by Malawians -- the people hate him.
Sir David Steel recently stated that Dr Banda had #2000m stashed away
for a rainy day -- the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh may yet
receive donations!

Our telephone was out of order from December 30, 1994, to January 6,
1995. I was told by a BT representative on 151, ''Our technicians are
off duty until January 4, 1995.''
In such circumstances the aged, the infirm, and the sick, if living

Other utilities provide an emergency standby service on public

I had hopes for Scottish rugby in 1995 despite John Beattie's
tergiversations, Brian Meek's witty bar-room reminiscences, and Bill
McMurtrie's exposure of a dithering establishment.
I sat down to BBC's Rugby Special hoping to feast upon the first of
many victories for Scotland in the new year, but a great ''roast beef''
marked Souster took away all my joy as he quickly disposed of a notable
win for a senior international side, a praiseworthy triumph for the
Scottish schoolboys over the Welsh -- ''It would help to atone for their
defeat by the Australian schoolboys'' -- and failed to mention the
Border League.
We were entertained by English club rugby and muddy Welsh fisticuffs.
Is this to be our diet in World Cup year?
What is the point of having regional sports programmes if we cannot
have informed enthusiasm for Scottish sport? Are we likely to get that
from our English friends?
Bill Johnson, Iain Anderson, John Beattie, Andy Irvine, Gordon Brown,
etc, have already distinguished themselves in rugby presentation. There
are many literate Scots ex-players who would light up our TV screens,
Finlay Calder for example.
Yet we are left with a third reserve who have as much to do with
Scottish rugby as a flat pint of mild and bitter.
How can the flower of Scotland grow in England's market garden?

On December 23 we watched, on Ceefax on TV, the changing flight
information at Glasgow Airport as we were awaiting the arrival of a
passenger via the Shuttle from Heathrow.
All flights were being delayed by several hours until suddenly at
19.20 BBC alerted us that flight BA 4962 was to be arriving at 19.31. We
live 20 minutes from the airport. A quick shift over to STV, which is
the recommended channel if you phone Glasgow Airport, told us that the
same flight was to be arriving some two hours later.
At 21.50, when my son phoned from the airport, he told us that he had
just been advised that the plane was being de-iced at Heathrow and would
be airborne soon. It eventually touched down at 23.45.
Is this a cunning plot by the Car Parks Association of Glasgow Airport
to soak unsuspecting Ceefax viewers by keeping them in the car park for
hours longer than they intended in order to raise money to rebuild
Parkhead?
We all appreciate that weather conditions affect travel, but a public
service is either a service or it is not. I suggest that those who
provide such a service are best judged when the going gets difficult. If
they cannot provide a proper service then they should move over and let
someone else who can.

I wonder if football writers and commentators might be persuaded to
water down their adulation of Brian Laudrup just a little.
He is by world soccer standards a very good player, but this constant
and extravagant eulogising of his talents simply focuses unwelcome
attention on our own low level of attainment, and we are already too
well aware of our deficiencies in this area.
Jeremy Bates would no doubt also have his standing artificially
inflated if he were to play his tennis at Newlands or Craiglockhart.
This is not intended as iconoclasm. The man is unquestionably gifted,
but as he continues to prance and cavort among the ranks of the inept,
let it be recognised that while his game may be on a higher plane, he is
not from another planet.

IT LOOKS as it if was easier to expel the Tory rebels than it will be
to get them back into their party. Earlier in the week they demonstrated
their essential political identity by supporting the Government in key
votes. They are not permanent rebels, but disaffected supporters. They
have a capacity to delight their opponents and hurt their colleagues --
witness Mrs Gorman's remarks about an ''immature group at present
running the country'' -- but they are one-issue rebels, whose views have
been mismanaged by the Cabinet and their own Whips and who need wooing
rather than the political strangulation which exasperation might
otherwise reserve for them. They have an unusual clout because of the
Government's small majority, but that hardly justifies the inept tactics
which first put them into the cold as a group. The Whips are now charged
with ''divide and rule'' following an attempt to bring back only one
clutch of them. From a Tory point of view the sooner they are all back
the better. Excluding some -- no matter how few -- simply keeps
rebellion alive. One rebel may be dismissed as a maverick, an ornament
to tolerance even, the sign visible and unmistakable that the party is
broadminded. That argument (which might even have elements of truth)
falls away once more than two are involved. Kicking the nine out was a
blunder, and failing to get them back by inept handling merely compounds
the initial error.
When Disraeli insisted, ''Forget your principles, stick to your
party'', he was deploying one of his favourite techniques, making
political truth easier to swallow by coating it with cynicism. A
two-party system can only work if participants regularly surrender much
of their independence. The price is demanded not just by the Whips, who
are only the organs of the majority of their colleagues, but by public
opinion which prefers to believe that parties are, as their stereotypes
proclaim, bodies of like-minded people united by principle to oppose
somewhat similar monoliths with very distinct -- and publicly damaging
-- notions. The reality is very different and far more interesting, but
when it is challenged openly, trouble is inevitable. The nine Tory
rebels offer a case in point. They show how useful the adhesive of party
loyalty is. Like water, sand, and cement, the constituents are simple --
similarity of temperament, force of habit, and ambition. When the mix
itself dissolves, whole structures can fracture and defy quick repair.

THE CONSTITUTION
THIS week England woke up to realise that The Constitution will
dominate the next General Election campaign, as each party digs into its
chosen trench. The Prime Minister elevated the issue to the top of the
agenda, believing it could unite his party in readiness to confront
opponents head-on. The Secretary of State for Scotland is a frontline
officer in this battle, whose growing significance has prompted a change
in his style. Presiding over a largely alien political landscape has in
the past made Ian Lang far more consensual, even conciliatory, on a
range of issues than his English colleagues. But on the constitution
there is no middle ground. His claims for Taking Stock failed to
convince the 80% of Scots favouring some kind of parliament on Calton
Hill. So he must sell the merits of the status quo, fly the Union Flag,
and disparage any perceived tinkering with the sacred constitution. This
makes for far tougher language, more bellicose rhetoric. As the debate
bubbled up at Westminster, he talked to Scottish Political Correspondent
Robbie Dinwoodie at Dover House.
* YOU seem to relish the fact that the constitutional question is
being made a major issue in British politics.
* I am convinced that the Labour Party's devolution case is bogus,
that it doesn't stand up to scrutiny. They know that too, which is why
they are trying to say that the debate has moved on. The truth is that
the debate has never been answered by them. They have not answered the
West Lothian question. They haven't addressed the issue of why Scots
should pay more in taxation than the rest of the UK.
* OR less? The plan is for the Scottish Parliament to have power to
raise or lower income tax by 3p.
* There is no question of them paying less because, if they cut
taxation in Scotland, the Chancellor will cut the benefits coming from
the UK. It's inconceivable that we would be allowed to enjoy higher
spending in Scotland of 20 to 25% a head, which is what we have at
present, while at the same time paying less in taxation. Let's live in
the real world, shall we?
The consequences of higher taxation would be dramatically bad. Inward
investment would dry up overnight. The consequences of constitutional
uncertainty would dry up investment. Companies would move south.
Americans and Japanese and other foreign countries would cease to choose
Scotland as their preferred location.
* SURELY there are sound arguments for decentralisation?
* It's very important that we should not confuse devolution and
decentralisation. I'm strongly in favour of decentralisation. It's the
sort of thing we have been doing in setting up health trusts, which the
Labour Party wants to abolish or take over through local councils. It's
the sort of thing we have been doing through reducing central taxation.
It's the sort of thing we have been doing through denationalisation,
reducing bureaucracy and state control.
Our whole ethos is governed by a wish to decentralise, in contrast to
the Labour Party which has always -- because it's endemic, it's inherent
in socialist philosophy -- wanted to centralise and control from the
centre.
The whole nationalisation programme took control of great rafts of
Scottish industry out of Scotland and centralised it in Whitehall. I'm
in favour of decentralisation and our track record justifies that.
* BUT are you not decentralising by quango, rather than democracy?
* Quangos, which incidentally we have almost halved in number since
coming into office, are another way of Government divesting itself of
the decision-making process. The decisions that are taken at present by
so-called quangos are decisions which in the past were taken by faceless
officials within central government.
But that is quite different -- worlds apart -- from the constitutional
game that the Labour Party is playing, which is one of centralising
power in Edinburgh in a Parliament that would concentrate power in such
a way as to increase the totality of bureaucracy and government, that
would undermine the powers of local authorities in Scotland, and that
would lead to extra taxation, regulation and control from a Parliament
in Edinburgh on top of the existing Parliament at Westminster. That
isn't decentralisation at all.
* NORTHERN Ireland has been promised a referendum. We have had them on
Europe and on devolution in the past. Given the wish of the majority for
change in Scotland, why not test this now?
* How can people judge its merits if all they have is this vague,
meaningless, phrase. The (European) referendum was taking place on the
basis of us negotiating entry and passing an Act of Parliament and, it
is true, we had referendums in parts of the UK before, one in Northern
Ireland, one in Wales and one in Scotland, but these were on specific
propositions. That is perfectly legitimate.
I am not averse to a referendum. Indeed we fought to have it included
in the 1978 Scotland Act. But a referendum can only make sense in my
view when there is something to refer to it. That means the detailed
work, the negotiation and the legislation has to be worked out and
clearly debated and decided upon and then the package is put to the
electorate to ratify.
* BUT you are saying that, as long as Conservatives hold power, there
will be no scheme, therefore nothing to put to the people?
* That is correct. We are not planning the kind of major changes in
the constitution that would justify it. But the Labour Party must come
clean on this issue and agree that they will hold a referendum on the
proposals that they have for constitutional change if they carry them
through. It would be unthinkable to allow these changes to go through
without the ratification of a referendum.
* LABOUR and the Liberal Democrats say they have got a scheme, worked
out through a lengthy process in the Scottish Constitutional Convention.
* Absolute baloney!
* IN that case, why not test it at a referendum and beat it?
* If it has been worked out, why doesn't Tony Blair know what the West
Lothian question is?
* AS I understand it, the answer is that so-called asynchronous
devolution has worked elsewhere, Spain being the example.
* That is no answer at all. All these simplistic comparisons with the
constitutions of other countries which bear no relation to the
constitution of the UK and which in many cases have not worked well
where constitutional change has been introduced, go nowhere at all
towards answering the question. To say that the Labour Party has thought
through all the detail of these proposals is absolute rubbish. Let's see
these details. Why can't they answer the most elementary questions about
them?
* THEY say they are about to come forward with a scheme for
decentralised, democratic government in England.
* Well, I shall await it with interest and so, no doubt, will the
English. On the one hand we have Harry Ewing claiming to answer the West
Lothian question by setting up assemblies in England, and on the other
hand we have members of the Labour Party in England claiming that these
regional assemblies are really just going to be gatherings of existing
public bodies all brought together under one roof.
The plain fact is they haven't the faintest idea what they are
contemplating for England. They committed themselves to setting up
regional assemblies where people want them.
They have no idea what their powers will be, what the membership will
be, what the boundaries will be. I can see enormous numbers of
difficulties and no benefits at all. Certainly, it doesn't begin to
counterbalance what they are threatening Scotland with.
* ON all indications -- polls and General Election results -- most
Scots are not pure Unionists. They want to see some change from the
status quo.
* Most people in Scotland want to feel that Scotland is getting a fair
crack of the whip, that Scotland is getting the best possible
Government. It's like asking people if they are in favour of sunshine
and apple pie. You tend to get the answer yes.
But when people look into the detail and realise that what they are
actually being offered is an extra layer of taxation and bureacracy, an
additional layer of government, centralisation of some local government
powers in Edinburgh, and the weakening of Scotland's place at the United
Kindom's Parliament -- and these are just some of the issues that emerge
as soon as you lift the lid on all this -- then they begin to think
twice. That is what has happened in the past.
We were told in 1978 that Scotland was screaming out for devolution.
When it came to the referendum fewer than one third of the Scottish
people actually wanted to vote in favour of it.
* A MAJORITY of those who voted, voted in favour . . .
* But that was because the referendum required a 40% threshhold and
those who were campaigning in favour of it said if you don't vote it
counts as a no, so a lot of people didn't vote.
* WHAT about Lord Home saying don't vote for this scheme because we
will give you something better.
* Lord Home had no official status in the Conservative Party or the
Government and what he said about it influenced, I would guess, a very
small number of people.
The fact is that the Labour Party told us that everyone in Scotland
wanted devolution and when it came to the crunch very few did. Fewer
than a third of the total electorate took the trouble to go and vote for
this devolutionary programme which we were told everybody wanted. Now
that was for an assembly without tax-raising powers. What do you think
would be the issue if they came along with an assembly with tax-raising
powers?
* IS your position not a Catch 22? You are saying the scheme is flawed
and people would vote against, but you are saying as long as you have
your way they will never get an opportunity to decide?
* That is right. I am inviting people to cast their vote in the next
General Election for a party that is determined to maintain Scotland's
place in the United Kingdom rather than jeopardise it in the long term
and damage it in the short term with higher taxation and more
bureaucracy.
* DOESN'T Labour's constitutional plans for Scotland play into your
hands by keeping down support for independence? If Tam Dalyell and
English Labour rebels wreck their party's plans for a devolved
Parliament, is there not a likelihood of a resurgent SNP?
* There may be that possibility, but this is too central and
fundamental an issue to resolve in terms of short-term party advantage
and I don't see it in terms of party advantage. I do see it very
strongly in terms of principle and I believe that the devolution policy
of the Labour Party is unworthy in itself of Scotland.
The Liberals have a different approach. The Liberals have an approach
that is federalist. That at least has some kind of philosophical
coherence. I believe it is wrong, I believe it is unwanted, I believe it
is irrelevant but it is at least intellectually more credible.
The devolution policy of the Labour Party is not a coherent and
credible alternative form of government for Scotland within a unitary
system. It is ersatz, it is bogus and ultimately it is unviable, and
therefore it is only one remove from separation. If we are going to face
separation in Scotland I would rather face it head on and argue the case
head on. Again, at least you know where you are with the separatists.
They want to break Scotland off from the rest of the United Kingdom.
The great danger that I see at the moment is that too many of my
countrymen may be lulled into thinking that devolution is a soft option,
an easy answer, without realising the trap that it brings with it.
* WHAT about those in your own party who support devolution.
* You could count them on the fingers of one hand. There are very few,
very few indeed. I believe the vast, overwhelming majority support the
view that I take. We are the Conservative and Unionist Party. It is
absolutely central to our being.
It is also good, economic, sound sense from Scotland's point of view
to remain the UK. We can't go on deluding ourselves that we are being
deprived at a time when we are getting more than 20% per head of the
UK's exchequer spent in Scotland. We are doing dramatically better in
spending terms in Scotland than England. Let's not delude ourselves and
pretend otherwise.
It is always easy to stir up a sense of dissatisfaction and grievance,
of calls for more democracy. There is a democratic deficit, people
claim. The reality is that there isn't. We have local councillors, we
have Members of Parliament, we have Members of the European Parliament.
What is achieved by creating another layer of democratically-elected
individuals, other than more bureaucracy, more government, more expense,
more taxation and less clarity and efficiency.
* HAS Taking Stock run its course?
* One thing that Taking Stock does is to demonstrate that the UK
constitution is an organic thing. It is something that can evolve,
develop and change over a period of time. I believe it should only do so
gradually. An inherent strength of is it that it can change, but it
should only do so gradually and organically.
I think it also demonstrates our willingness to make changes where
these can be seen to deliver an advantage and where they do not
undermine the central core of the integrity of the UK and its
Parliament. I think that the changes that we have produced, although not
individually dramatic, cumulatively add up to quite a substantial
change, the benefits of which will come through over time and not
overnight.
For example we have given a broad range of new powers to the Scottish
Grand Committee. It can now meet in other parts of Scotland than
Edinburgh. It can take the second readings of Bills and we have done
both of these things in the last few months and will do so again. It can
now have adjournment debates, it can have question sessions, it can have
statements from Ministers, it can have the opportunity to question a
Minister from the House of Lords, which in the past has never been
possible.
These are all developments which cumulatively add up to a substantial
change in the handling of Scottish business. Most of them have not been
implemented even once, but will be over the next few months. Therefore,
over a period of time people will become more aware of this important
committee handling a range of Scottish business in a way that is more
accessible and more visible to the people of Scotland.
* BECAUSE of the large degree of cross-party consensus during the
Scottish Grand Committee's consideration of the Children's Bill, you
were asked to forego the use of English Conservative MP's to maintain
your majority. You refused. Why?
* That is an issue for the Westminster Parliament and not just for me.
It is important that the Government has to be able to command a majority
for its legislation, otherwise Parliament cannot operate, and we would
adhere to that principle.
But I did introduce, and I think it has been a helpful innovation, the
Special Standing Committee procedure for Scottish legislation which will
enable that Bill to be scrutinised in Scotland by a special standing
committee taking evidence from expert bodies and voluntary bodies and
other interested participants in the welfare of children.
That is before it goes into committee and therefore the benefit of
that process will be to make the committee debates more informed and
lead to a better bill. This is something which is based on consensus. It
is a cross-party thing. I don't seek party advantage out of it, but I do
seek better legislation out of it.
* WHAT about something more permanent? Say, the Scottish MPs meeting
one day a week in Scotland to conduct Scottish business?
* The difficulty of that is you would then have a situation where
Scottish MPs would be prevented, or would have to make a choice between
Scotland and Westminster. There may be important Scottish business
handled at Westminster on those occasions, and therefore there is a
limit to how far you can carry this process.
But, if there are other alternatives for evolution of the constitution
in a way that will help Scotland, then of course I am willing to look at
them. Although we made 50 specific announcements in our White Paper, the
changes that we have made are not conclusive and there may be others to
come.
THE HCI AFFAIR
NHS was helped
ONE of the major scandals of 1994 was the collapse of the Health Care
International private hospital at Clydebank, built amid political
acrimony after the outlay of huge sums of public money.
Some #27 million of public funding, plus #10m spent in site
preparation, had been spent when the receiver was called in -- but the
Government has attempted to play down HCI as a political issue,
insisting that, as with all inward investment projects, some succeed
while others fail.
* WHAT about the damage of the HCI affair against the backdrop of
continuing problems in the NHS?
* HCI is not an issue of the health service. Not a penny of health
service money went into it, it does not undermine the health service,
indeed it has helped the health service quite considerably . . . well,
helped it to reduce its waiting lists at the margin.
HCI was an inward investment case. The company decided 10 years ago to
come to Scotland. They negotiated over the late eighties and,
ultimately, were offered financial assistance on exactly the same basis
as the scheme operated throughout the whole of the UK, processed on an
automatic basis by officials of the Scottish Office and the Treasury,
and with the agreement of the Department of Health on those health
matters that had to be considered.
That is one case which then ran into difficulties -- out of 350 that
have come to Scotland in the last five years. It has to be seen in the
context of the whole inward investment effort. We are processing cases
at the moment at a rate of almost two a week. The vast majority of these
are extremely successful.
They are not all of a comparable scale. There have been bigger
investments than this, there are two at the moment going ahead. There
was the Motorola announcement recently of a #250m project on top of
another #250m they had just completed. There is the NEC commitment of
half a billion pounds to a silicon plant in East Kilbride.
There have been other bigger ones in the past, so it fits into the
general picture. And it is one which, on the face of it -- and I hope it
turns out that way -- is going to have a future.
* WERE mistakes made?
* That will emerge from the National Audit Office scrutiny, which I
welcome and which I have made absolutely clear to the department that it
has to be very fully and openly co-operated with. I have already sought
to explore the way in which the department handled this seven or eight
years ago when they were processing it, and make sure that all
procedures were properly followed and, so far as I am aware, no serious
mistakes of any kind have been found.
* BUT procedural and administrative, rather than political, in which
case the buck would stop on your desk.
* It isn't a political issue. We are all agreed that we want to
attract new jobs to unemployment blackspots. We set up an Enterprise
Zone in Clydebank to recognise the degree of difficulty there was in
attracting employment to that area. This was a project which indicated
up to 1800 direct jobs and a large number of indirect jobs. I hope that
we will now achieve those. We are some way towards it, but there is
still a very considerable way to go.
* INVOLVING more public money?
* No there won't. An offer has been made. Most of the offer has been
taken up. If the remaining jobs are created, then the company will be
able to claim the remaining assistance that has been offered.
COUNCIL REFORM
Local lift-off
THE Government has embarked on a huge upheaval in local government,
tearing down a system erected 20 years ago and replacing it with a
single-tier set-up. Mr Lang explained why this was a change worth making
and a risk worth taking.
* LOCAL government reform is bound to involve a degree of short-term
disruption in advance of any possible long-term gains. Does that pose
political problems?
* It might do. That is always the difficulty you face when you take
decisions to restructure things or develop things in a long-term way.
But that is not a reason for not doing them.
We set out to reform local government because we believed the present
system could be improved upon. Indeed the other parties did too. They
were all in favour of single-tier local government although they now
choose to forget that fact.
But I believe the benefits can flow through quite quickly, given a
positive approach to the new structure from officials, local government
and the new councillors. I believe that positive approach will be
forthcoming. There are considerable benefits in improved efficiency,
local accountability and a scale of local government that people can
identify with more readily. The boundary issue is one on which the
Government has now been vindicated. I think the map that we drew . . .
has the support of most sectors of the community.
* LOCAL authorities have had success in using the system of notional
capital receipts -- borrowing against future commercial rental income --
to fund new developments.
* I am glad the Government has been able to play its part in helping
all these things to happen.
* WHY close the door then?
* It's a very limited door. They are not precluded from carrying on
these kinds of ventures in the future, but what we are doing is simply
closing what in other quarters would be termed a tax loophole in the
sense that it is a notional receipt which local authorities have been
able to convert into a capacity to spend capital. It isn't actual cash
in the hand that they have. It is a device that they have been using.

LABOUR SPLITS
Blair's root failing
* UNDER John Major's leadership, the party which always prided itself
on loyalty has been riven by a series of damaging splits, culminating in
the rebellion by the Euro-sceptics and the withdrawal of the Whip. While
the Cabinet has smouldered with tensions between Thatcherite hardliners
and the leadership -- and the Conservative Party at large has threatened
to tear itself apart over Europe -- Tony Blair enjoyed an extended
honeymoon as new Labour leader.
That honeymoon is emphatically over. He has had to declare war on his
traditionalists over Clause 4, is fighting to keep devolution-sceptics
on side, and his normally smooth-running publicity machine has suffered
embarrassment of late. There is an audible sigh of relief from the
Tories that at last they have something to get their teeth into, and Mr
Lang has shown particular appetite for the task.
* IT must be encouraging for Conservatives to see signs of division in
Labour ranks for the first time under Tony Blair.
* The Labour Party has been walking on clouds for the last six months,
clouds largely generated by their own hot air and they are now
discovering that you can't . . . just get away with empty phrase-making
and wish lists.
You have to spell out proper policies, these policies have to be
thought through and tested, and that is the experience that Tony Blair
and his colleagues are now coming up against. You have this absurd
pantomime over their education policy over the last week or two when
they did the fastest U-turn in history on VAT and charitable status on
private education and graduate taxation. We have the reality coming home
to Mr Blair that on Clause 4 his party is still adhering to its fixed
principles, even if he is not.
* IF he comes through the Clause 4 battle successfully, will that not
make him an even more fomidable opponent?
* He won't have won by the spring, whatever winning means, because
there is a whole range of policies which his party has not begun to
spell out yet, and we are going to continue to press for answers on all
Labour's policies between now and the General Election.
He is offering no alternative to Clause 4. If he were offering an
alternative creed or alternative faith, some kind of coherent philosophy
into which all the policies fell into place, then it would be
understandable what he was doing. What he is doing, though, is applying
an ad man's philosphy to a political faith which has motivated his party
since birth. That ad man's philosophy has no roots and no credibility.
TORY FORTUNES.
Party's support will rally before poll that matters
THE MONTHLY opinion polls carried out by System Three for The Herald
since 1974 chart an alarming picture of decline for the Conservative
Party in Scotland.
Last June saw the party's rating plummet to a 20-year low of 10%, and
the average for the year was also unprecedented, at just 13% --
apparently indicating more than a simple case of mid-term blues.
Mr Lang insists that Conservatives have a record of returning to the
fold at General Elections -- giving the party more than two years to get
the economy on the mend and his party back up to the 26% they polled in
the last election. He discussed his party's standing, gave his views on
the economy, and answered speculation about his own future.
* HOW do you account for your current low rating in the polls in
Scotland?
* People read too much into them and forget that swings right
themselves, and that at General Elections traditional party loyalties
re-emerge. The picture that suggests our support is at half what it was
at the last General Election, and that therefore we are going to be
wiped off the face of the map, is a totally misleading one.
It's like saying when you get a by-election with a 26% swing against
the Government that, if this were repeated at a General Election, there
would be no Tories left in the country.
The reality is that it isn't going to be repeated. It never has been
in the past. It is a particular low but it's not very far from where we
were in the last Parliament at one stage -- only a point or two of a
difference -- and that's against the background of our support in the
rest of the United Kingdom having just about halved in opinion-poll
terms, so you have got to see it in a UK context. I am confident that
the economic cycle is moving very strongly our way and that the benefits
of what we are doing, the painful and difficult decisions we have had to
take, are yet to come. People will look back on our total achievement.
* WHAT if the recession ends but prosperity grows unevenly, leaving
the poor further behind?
* I don't accept that. So far as measurement of poverty is concerned,
because benefit levels have increased and these are used as the
yardstick, it is deemed that more people are poor because they are below
the higher levels to which benefits have moved. I don't believe that
absolute poverty has increased and, so far as homelessness is concerned,
the number and standard of house in Scotland has risen substantially in
the last few years.
But there has been a breakdown in family, and much of the homelessness
which exists is the product of broken homes, broken marriages and the
like.
* SURELY homeless people begging in the street must have at least a
psychological impact?
* I don't think the degree or extent of that has risen dramatically,
nor do I think it is a sound measurement of the state of an economy. But
on the economic cycle generally I do believe that, not only has Scotland
improved relative to the rest of the UK, but also that the UK has
improved its position substantially, relative to the rest of Europe.
We are now much more competitive than we were. We are much stronger
based. Of course, there is fragility in some aspects of the economy, but
let's not write down the quality of our achievement thus far, which is
markedly better and stronger than the economy which we were operating in
Scotland 10 or 15 years ago.
* HOW low can Tory support fall and still legitimately govern
Scotland? A single Conservative MP?
* I don't accept the hypothesis. This is exactly the sort of question
we were being asked two years before the last General Election, and we
gave our answer on polling day, and we will do the same again.
* THERE has been much recent speculation about your own position,
suggesting you may be moving on to another Cabinet post.
* Endlessly. I'm not sure whether it is wishful thinking or whether I
should take it as flattery. But realistically I have a big job as
Secretary of State for Scotland, I am fully stretched doing it, I have
made it clear before that I find it a very rewarding job, and I believe
that the policies I am helping to deliver in Scotland are leading to
worthwhile results. It is the best job any Scottish politician could
aspire to and I aspire to no other.
The media love speculating on personalities and people. I choose to be
flattered by the references, which I regard as wishful thinking, but I
don't take it very seriously.
* EVEN when the speculation goes as far as discussing your successor?
* Then I suppose I should start looking over my shoulder and worrying
about the threat! But the field is not a large one. Any one of my
colleagues could be Secretary of State for Scotland and would do the job
well in a variety of ways, but there isn't a large number of them.
* SO why is Michael Forsyth's name coming up?
* Michael is a Minister of State who has served as such in three
Government departments with considerable skill and distinction and he
has very great qualities which are widely recognised and he is a great
asset to the party.
I certainly don't seek any change and I don't see a very obvious
probability.
* IS a snap election a real possibility?
* Let's not forget that we were elected with a small majority in 1992.
We made a dramatic recovery of our political fortunes when John Major
became Prime Minister in order to achieve that, but it was a small
majority.
We have well over two years legitimately left to us. An awful lot can
happen in that time, and I see number of very promising trends moving in
our direction.
* BASED on what?
* Based on the economy, based on the failure of the Labour Party to
offer a coherent alternative.

A MAN who crashed his car through the gates of Buckingham Palace has
mental and medical problems, police said last night.
The 21-year-old student drove 300 miles from Wakefield, West
Yorkshire, before plunging his car into the famous wrought iron gates at
the top of The Mall early yesterday.
One gate buckled and toppled on to the blue, X-registered Volkswagen
Scirocco and the other was slightly damaged. However, the man was
unhurt.
Scotland Yard said that he had been detained under the Mental Health
Act and taken to a psychiatric unit.
''He has been sectioned under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. He
has not been charged, and he is being taken to a psychiatric unit,'' a
spokesman said.
It is understood the man was driving at more than 50mph up the Mall.
Without braking, he careered round the Victoria Memorial in front of
the palace and ploughed straight into the heavy gates.
A palace official said: ''It was amazing that he was not hurt. He was
driving very fast indeed.''
No member of the royal family was in residence. The Queen was staying
at Sandringham, her Norfolk home.
Inspector Jon Newman at Charing Cross police station refused to say if
the crash was an accident, saying that he did not know if the man
intended to harm himself.
The matter was out of the hands of police after the psychiatrist's
assessment and a charge of criminal damage was unlikely to be brought as
the crash could not be proved to be a deliberate or reckless act, he
added.
The gates were installed in 1911 as part of commemorations for Queen
Victoria, who died 10 years earlier.
A palace spokesman yesterday said it was impossible to put a cost on
the damage to the gates, but that contractors were already inspecting
them and assessing the repairs.
Flatmates of the student in Wakefield said yesterday he was a quiet,
bookish man, studying English, who enjoyed playing pool and squash but
had no strong political views.
He reportedly showed no signs of depression when he returned from
Wakefield college on Thursday and dumped his bags in the hallway of the
digs he shares with three young women.
The three, who refused to be named, spoke through a slightly ajar
front door of a rented house in Pinderfields Road, Wakefield.
They said he had lived in the house since joining the college as a
mature first-year student in October, but returned home to Liverpool for
Christmas.

<TEXT>
A 42-YEAR-OLD man, who was so obsessed with a schoolgirl that he
booked a wedding reception and sent her the details, has been put on
probation for three years.
Philip Canali, who was convicted of a sex offence involving the girl,
now 15, in 1988, sent her letters and cards saying that he loved her and
wanted to marry her.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday, Sheriff D W McIntyre put Canali,
of Clovenstone Gardens, Edinburgh, who had earlier admitted a breach of
peace, on probation with an added condition that he must not contact the
girl.
''This has been a most bizarre offence,'' he told him.
The charge stated that Canali:
* Sent postcards saying he had been watching her.
* Had letters passed to her at school saying that he loved her and
wanted to marry her.
* Sent her a card saying he had booked their wedding and that he would
die for her.
* Booked a wedding reception at a hotel and had the wedding package
and brochure sent to her.
Canali, divorced with two sons both older than the girl, was jailed
for a sex offence involving the girl in 1988.
Depute-fiscal Isabel Clark told an earlier hearing that three years
later he sent her a card from Blackpool saying he had seen her and that
he ''loved the white band in her hair''.
Other letters were given to fellow pupils at her school to pass on.
One contained a photograph of her house signed by Canali.
Solicitor Ms Jacqui Cunningham said that Canali had a ''strange
compulsion''.
She said: ''He is coming to terms only now with the fact that this is
a very odd fixation for a 42-year-old man to have.''
Canali was warned by the sheriff that he could be jailed if he
approached or contacted the girl.

AN UNEMPLOYED clerk was placed on probation for one year yesterday for
sending offensive messages and material through the post to leading
politicians.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that Douglas McKinlay sent the parcels to
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, Minister Allan Stewart, Mr Phil Gallie, the
Conservative MP for Ayr, Lady Naomi Hirst, wife of Sir Michael Hirst,
chairman of the Tory Party in Scotland, and Cumbernauld's Labour MP
Norman Hogg.
McKinlay, 43, of Carrington Street, Woodlands, Glasgow, admitted
sending threatening, abusive, and offensive messages and material
through the post to the politicians.
Defence solicitor Mr Lewis Wilson told Sheriff Archie Bell that
McKinlay had become angry at Government policy and the lack of action by
Opposition MPs. ''He nows apologises unreservedly to his victims.''
McKinlay also admitted to contacting companies, pretending to be his
victims, and getting them to mail unsolicited items to them and making
telephone calls to their private lines during which he either whistled,
made offensive remarks, or just remained silent.
The charges named the Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, his wife, Venetia,
and daughter, Caroline, among McKinlay's victims.
A further two Labour MPs, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson
and Mrs Helen Liddle, MP for Monklands East, received abusive letters.
During an earlier court appearance Sheriff Gerald Gordon, QC, heard
that McKinlay had started his campaign in 1991. It ended last year when
police monitored his telephone calls.
Sheriff Bell said: ''Politicians have to put up with enough criticism
without being persecuted in this way.''

A MAN has died following an operation which resulted in a surgeon
being suspended.
Mr William Callachan, 69, of Auldhill, Bridgend, West Lothian, died
last Friday in St John's Hospital, Livingston, a month after a colostomy
operation.
A widower, he is survived by his daughter, Wilma, and sons, Mark and
Jim, who have now taken legal advice pending investigations by the
hospital and the procurator-fiscal.
''We are led to believe that there are certain things surrounding my
father's operation which led to a chap being suspended,'' Mr Jim
Callachan said yesterday.
Consultant general surgeon Mr Gerald Davies, 47, was suspended on full
pay on December 17 by the West Lothian NHS Trust pending an internal
inquiry.
The procurator-fiscal at West Lothian, Miss Linda Ruxton, said it was
reported to her last Friday as a sudden death which might be associated
with a surgical operation.
She instructed an independent pathologist to conduct a post-mortem
examination, the results of which came in on Monday. This attributed
death to a pulmonary embolism, venous thrombosis in lower limbs,
recurrent cancer, colostomy after bowel obstruction, and coronary artery
atheroma.
''I am awaiting a full report from the post-mortem and I will then
make further inquiries which will include speaking to the relatives,''
she said.
However, there have been question marks over the way the hospital has
handled the incident.
By the middle of this week, the hospital was still denying any
knowledge of the patient having died, despite the fact that it had
reported the fact to the fiscal four days earlier. Its general services
manager, Mr Graham Young, who acts as press spokesman, said on Tuesday
that he was not aware of the patient's death.
Mr Young said yesterday he had not been informed by other hospital
officials until Wednesday evening. ''In this instance, they felt that
there was no real need for me to know,'' he added.
Last night, Mr Robert Stevenson, secretary of Lothian Health Council,
said: ''We are extremely concerned at the recent turn of events at St
John's. It is of crucial importance that this investigation is carried
out as quickly as possible and the full facts are made known.''

<HEADLINE>West's wife is accused of tenth murder</HEADLINE>

THE Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday it would press on with
charges against Mrs Rosemary West despite her husband Frederick's
apparent suicide.
It added a tenth murder charge to the list. Mrs West, 41, was accused
of the murder of her eight-year-old stepdaughter Charmaine, Frederick
West's eldest daughter from his first marriage who was born in Scotland.
Gloucester builder Mr West apparently hanged himself on New Year's Day
in a prison cell in Birmingham, where he had been on remand charged with
murdering 12 people, including Charmaine and his first wife Catherine,
25.
A spokesman said the CPS would seek Mrs West's committal to trial
before magistrates in Dursley, Gloucestershire, on February 6.
''The Crown will seek Rosemary West's committal to the Crown Court on
a total of 10 charges of murder,'' the CPS spokesman said.
Committal proceedings are expected to last a week before chief
metropolitan stipendiary magistrate Mr Peter Badge decides if a case has
been established to send her for trial.
But Mrs West's lawyer, Mr Leo Goatley, has said he would argue that
charges against the mother of eight should be dropped because her
chances of a fair trial had been prejudiced by media coverage of the
case.
Mr Goatley was with Mrs West yesterday at Pucklechurch remand centre,
near Bristol, where she was charged with murdering Charmaine between May
1, 1971, and December 31, 1971.
He said she replied: ''I am innocent.''
Charmaine was born in Coatbridge on March 22, 1963. She was placed in
temporary council care at the age of seven after the break-up of her
parents' marriage, but she was returned to Mr West after he remarried.
Charmaine's body was discovered by police in May under the concrete
floor of a kitchen extension at 25 Midland Road, Gloucester, where Mr
West had lived with Catherine.
The 12 murder counts against Mr West included nine victims whose
remains were found in February and March 1994 in the house and garden of
25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester.
He was also accused of the murders of Charmaine, Catherine and family
nanny Ms Anne McFall, 18. The remains of Catherine and Anne were found
in adjoining cornfields at Kempley, a mile from Much Marcle, West's home
village.
* Cheltenham solicitor Mr Howard Ogden, who represented Mr West
between February and August last year, was yesterday granted a renewed
High Court injunction banning a former clerk at his firm from disclosing
or publishing confidential information obtained from clients.
Mr Ogden brought the case against Mr Scott Canavan to prevent him
approaching newspapers with details of interviews with Mr West.
The injunction was granted by Judge Sir John Wood at a private
hearing. Mr Canavan was not represented although he was served with
notice of the hearing.
Meanwhile, professional disciplinary proceedings against Mr Ogden over
allegations that he tried to sell Mr West's life story stand adjourned
until November. Mr Ogden is strongly contesting the case.

<FLAG>DEPARTMENT USELESS INFORMATION,</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>980369646</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE department of Useless Information was last week largely
Misinformation and we will tell you why. A sudden spirit of wilfullness
came over us at the festive period. We could hardly resist the
misspelling of wur music critic's name which is, of course, Tumelty.
This was quite simply because Michael was failing to return the
Department's call over the origin of several nice wee tunes.
A reader wrote that Happy Birthday to You had figured in a Mozart
symphony. This turns out to be utterly wrong, though the reader's
insistence that another famous and most sung song -- Here Comes the
Bride -- is from Wagner's Lohengrin is absolutely correct.
Happy Birthday, Tumelty tells me, was written by Clayton F Summy, head
of a Chicago publishing firm established in 1988. ''It is said that two
little old ladies from Idaho presently own the copyright and, therefore,
every time it is sung in public you are breaking the law''.
Thank you, Michael. But perhaps you haven't got it entirely right. The
Department's information from Gammond and Fox's nearly definitive
History of Popular Music (1958) states the song was written by Mildred
and Patty S Hill, of New York, and published in 1935. The copyright will
remain till 2010 when this editor will celebrate his 67th birthday and,
if you will believe that, you will believe Tumelty at that.
But you can believe Tumelty when he tells you that Stravinsky filched
it in a little orchestral prelude he wrote for conductor Pierre
Montreux's 80th birthday in 1955. He did not mean it.
''One of the players had just become a daddy so the band played it.
Igor, who did not know the piece, thought the band was taking the piss
out of him and stormed off in a fit of pique''. I thought music critics
wrote their letters in black tie and not in such salty language.
By the way, For He's a Jolly Good Fellow, writes Jean-Paul Sadie, of
Paris, France, was originally the French Malbrouk. This cannot be true.
There are no jolly good fellows in France and we all know that.
The Department was soundly thrashed by several correspondents over its
intentional faux pas concerning the parentage of Hoagland (Hoagy)
Carmichael's classic song, Stardust. Mr Jim Campbell, of Robroyston,
admitted we had come close to the lyric-writer.
His name was Mitchell Parish and he wrote many lyrics including
Sophisticated Swing and Sweet Lorraine. Colleague and fellow sports
writer Ken Gallacher points out Mr Parrish also wrote Sophisticated Lady
and was for many years a lyric writer for Benny Goodman.
Gallacher also gives the editor of the Department more information
than you can deal with this week and we will most assuredly return to
this topic except we have to note that one of the biggest name-drops the
Department has ever encountered comes from this Gallacher of Lenzie.
Hoagy at first tried the song out as an up-tempo number before slowing
it down. Gallacher said: ''The song was rejected by the Dorsey brothers,
Bix, Goodman, and Bud Freeman who told me this story.'' Aye Ken, at
first Jimi Hendrix wisnae happy with the Urban Voltaire's version of Hey
Joe. Right.
But to last week's stoatir. What is the longest word in the English
language you can get out of the top line of letters on a typewriter,
that line being QUERTYUIOP? Mr Michael Warren, a teacher, of Stranraer,
came up with the answer but added another.
''For many years, I cherished 'typewriter' as a peculiarly apt
10-letter example. This won until a precocious first-year pupil gave me
'proprietor'.'' Michael says another pupil once came up with
''proprietory'' but knocked it back on the basis that ''we can all well
do without one more Tory''. Too true, Michael.

THE last chapter in the gruesome story of family murder in the Channel
Islands was closed this week when Scots couple Nicholas and Elizabeth
Newall were buried in St Andrews.
The former teachers were bludgeoned to death by their eldest son,
Roderick, who last year was sentenced at Jersey Royal Court to two life
sentences after he admitted to the killings. Their other son, Mark, a
financier, was jailed for six years for his part in helping to dispose
of the bodies and cover up the crime.
The couple -- whose bodies had lain in a shallow grave for six years
in a field near the island's Greve de Lecq beach -- were buried in a
single casket in St Andrews Western Cemetery. They had first met in the
town while teaching at New Park School and enjoyed a gregarious,
outgoing life together.
The quiet, private committal ceremony came more than seven years after
the Newalls disappeared from their bungalow on Jersey following a family
celebration on October 10, 1987.
The couple were declared dead ''beyond all reasonable doubt'' on
January 3, 1991, by Jersey Royal Court, but it was not until the winter
of 1993 that their remains were recovered by police. Their sons
inherited an estate which is believed to be in the region of #1m.
Last month, the Newall's relatives withdrew a civil action designed to
disinherit the brothers, following an inquest verdict of unlawful
killing.
Mr Stephen Newall, twin brother of the murdered man, who lives in Rhu,
Dunbartonshire, and Mrs Newall's sister, Mrs Nan Clark, had asked for
injunctions of all relevant assets from the couple's estate.
Dates for a hearing had been set but they decided to abandon their
fight after a visit to Roderick in prison.
Thursday's memorial service was led at St Leonard's Parish Church in
St Andrews by Mr Stephen Newall's minister, the Rev David Clark of
Helensburgh's West Kirk, and was attended by family and close friends.
Mr Clark said last night: ''At long last, it was the opportunity for
them to be decently buried and with some dignity. It is over seven years
since the whole thing happened.
''After the coroners were finished in Jersey, they were then able to
release the remains and the Newalls were finally buried.''
The minister said the committal had been attended by Mr Stephen Newall
and Mrs Nan Clark. The later tribute was attended by family and friends.

CALEDONIAN Publishing Ltd, which publishes The Herald, the Evening
Times, and a range of magazines including Scottish Farmer, is to
co-develop multi-media management and archiving with Diwan Science and
Information Technology Ltd of London.
The project, which will deliver state-of-the-art database management
for multi-media publishers of all kinds, is based on Diwan's new Maps
technology (Media Archiving and Publishing System).
Caledonian will be first to benefit from the development when a new
picture and text database becomes operable later this month.
The installation will be the first of its kind at a major British
newspaper and marks a diversification by Caledonian into new media
technologies.
The company's chief executive, Mr Liam Kane, said yesterday: ''As a
by-product of introducing electronic pagination to both our newspapers,
we have assembled a highly-skilled information technology team. This
joint development by Diwan and the Caledonian team is the next step
along the road to integrated multi-media publishing, a road that all
publishers must take in the near future.''
Dr Ali Assam, Diwan's development and marketing director, said the
company looked forward to providing ''a complete media management
solution to Caledonian and to developing the latest solutions for the
publishing industry in association with Caledonian's technical staff''.
Diwan's Maps manages and archives news agency and scanned photographs,
text, document files, and video images from a range of sources including
satellite and dial-in services.
The system will be used at Caledonian initially to establish
navigational links between newspaper pictures, articles, and images of
published pages and later to play a significant role in the development
of on-line information services.
Dr Assam added: ''Our approach puts a complete story with all related
media at the publisher's disposal. This greatly simplifies tasks such as
sub-editing, archiving, and information retrieval.''

BRITISH Telecom and Glasgow District Council leader Pat Lally
yesterday appeared to have a crossed line over moves to split the city's
telephone book in two.
Councillor Lally issued a statement saying that he had been informed
that BT's plan to produce separate directories for north and south of
the Clyde had been ''put on hold'' and that the situation would be
reviewed later this month. ''On behalf of the people of Glasgow, I
greatly welcome this change of heart,'' he declared.
However, a spokeswoman for BT said that publication of the two
directories for Glasgow would still go ahead. What was being
reconsidered was the distribution of the books.
''There are elements of the distribution that we want to fine tune in
light of a meeting we had with the council this week,'' she said.
That meeting took place on Thursday and Councillor Lally later accused
BT of being ''very unwilling'' to consider the suggestion that, if two
directories were published, both should be issued to every phone user.
But BT rejected this allegation at the time, saying nothing had been
ruled in or out.

FOR as long as I can remember the Royal Lyceum has eased its audiences
into the spring season in as gentle a way as possible. Post-panto,
port-hangover, it's as if we're not quite ready to cope with anything so
heavy as serious drama. Ernest Thompson's On Golden Pond fits in with
the pattern.
It's not without its substance either. Thompson creates such an
amiable environment in his portrait of the onset of old age in a
lakeside summer house that you hardly notice him dropping in taboo
topics like sex, senility, and death -- and getting a laugh out of them.
He might fight shy of delivering the real emotional punches, but he gets
pretty close on the odd occasion when his deadpan characters ease off on
the wisecracks and face up to the truth about themselves.
Caroline Hall's well-rounded production is full of movement except for
the occasional touching moments of still contemplation, and the acting
is hard-nosed and punchy in a likable kind of a way. A buoyant Eileen
McCallum and a quick-witted Thane Bettany play the retired couple, she
in her late sixties, he facing 80, with a youthful sprightliness that
belies their characters' ages, contrasting amusingly with the
world-weary, hunch-shouldered teenager Bill (James Mackenzie).
Maybe it won't change your life, but it could stir up your evening.

THE Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland is to
fly to Malawi on an official visit next week as the country's former
president and one-time Kirk elder, Dr Hastings Banda, faces
murder-related charges.
It is less than two weeks ago that Dr Banda, who studied medicine in
Edinburgh, was placed under house arrest accused of ordering the murder
of four of his Cabinet Ministers.
Last night, Church officials denied it would cause any embarrassment
to the Kirk or the Rt Rev James Simpson, who will spend 18 days in the
central African state from January 18.
The Rev Jim Wilkie, the Kirk's Africa secretary, said yesterday the
visit had been arranged nine months ago.
He said: ''There were no plans for a meeting between the Moderator and
Dr Banda.''

<HEADLINE>Row threatens liquidation of Westscot</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A BITTER row has erupted, threatening the liquidation of Westscot
Homes, one of the Glasgow-based assured tenancy companies launched in
the late 1980s under the Business Expansion Scheme.
Nine significant shareholders in Westscot, collectively controlling
around 14% of the equity, have called for an extraordinary general
meeting seeking the voluntary winding up of the company and the
appointment of Mr Bryan Jackson, of accountants Pannell Kerr Foster, as
liquidator.
The move is being resisted by Westscot's board, chaired by Mr John
Loughray, a former Stakis director. The managing director is Mr Euan
Wallace, whose property company acts as managers for Westscot's
portfolio of 42 flats and houses. Westscot and Euan Wallace &amp; Partners
share the same Glasgow address.
In a letter to Westscot's 330 shareholders calling the meeting for
February 3, but urging shareholders to vote against the special
resolution, Mr Loughray said: ''This requisition is an unnecessary
expense for the company and an ill-timed diversion of our time and
energies.''
Ostensibly, the nine dissident shareholders, who include two of Mr
Wallace's former partners, are arguing that, after six years, during
which BES companies like Westscot have not delivered the large tax-free
returns originally envisaged, it is time to look for an orderly exit for
shareholders.
They are also pointing at the #60,000 a year Euan Wallace &amp; Partners
earns under a property management contract for Westscot's properties in
Glasgow's West End, Stirling, and Edinburgh.
In his letter, Mr Loughray said: ''The fees paid to our managers and
secretaries stand comparison with any of our competitors of a similar
size.''
Last night, Mr Wallace accused the group seeking liquidation of having
another agenda. ''We believe this proposal cannot be in the interests of
all our shareholders. Having been aware they would make this move since
last October, we cannot but conclude that they have a hidden agenda.''
The dissident shareholders include Mr Wallace's two former partners,
Mr David MacNab and Mr Stewart McAlpine, Mr Mario Romano, a
restaurateur, Mr Stanley Gauld, a car dealer, and Mr Tom Lenehan, a
Glasgow accountant. Some of them are being advised by Mr David Low, the
financier who featured in the Bremner saga a few years ago and, more
recently, played a key role in ousting the old Celtic board.
When the first BES assured tenancy companies were launched in 1988,
many of the prospectuses predicted large tax-free returns and a ready
exit five years down the line. An individual could invest up to #40,000
a year and get tax relief at their top marginal rate. A 40% taxpayer
investing #40,000 would, in effect, pay only #24,000.
With property values apparently on an ever-upward path, BES companies
were predicting double digit returns on their investments. Because the
assets were houses, there was a ready exit after the minimum five-year
period set by the Government to qualify for tax relief on the investment
and a disposal free of capital gains tax. The houses could then be sold.
The original Westscot prospectus, it is claimed, made clear at the
outset that its intention was not to liquidate after five years but to
use the BES relief to build a lasting property company.
But, like other such BES vehicles, the gap between predicted returns
and later reality has proved substantial. The property slump in the
early 1990s has seen some English BES companies write down their assets
to a fraction of their original cost.
Westscot has done rather better than that. It offered its shares at
125p, raised some #2.5m, and, after a revaluation last year, has a stock
of properties now valued at about #3m, producing rents of around
#250,000 a year. But profits in 1993 and 1994 were running at only #3021
and #27,261, respectively, before tax.
On a net asset value (NAV) basis, that original 125p investment in
Westscot is now worth around 132p a share. But experience in other BES
wind-ups suggests that, even in an orderly liquidation, the proceeds
realised would be at a significant discount to NAV, perhaps a discount
as big as 35% or even 40%.
The Westscot board says recent changes on the tax treatment of mergers
of BES companies have reopened a number of avenues the directors were
previously pursuing to allow the company to continue in existence, while
creating an exit for shareholders who want out.

WOMEN'S football, which is already on the increase in Scotland, is to
be further encouraged by the appointment of development officers.
The #13,000 posts, initially for one year, are to be set up in Central
region and Aberdeen. They are being funded by the Scottish Women's
Football Association through grant aid from the Football Trust. They
also have council support.
Girls' and women's football has just squeezed into the Scottish Sports
Council's top 10 of participation sports.
''There has been a massive increase in the past year and we have come
out of nowhere,'' said Ms Maureen McGonigle, the executive administrator
of the SWFA.
She said they would be looking for people with the SFA coaching
qualification C licence.
''There are only 16 women in Scotland with the higher B licence and we
thought C was appropriate. Obviously, it would be nice to fill the posts
with women.''
She said Aberdeen was a major area for the women's football in
Scotland with good clubs and good backing. Central region had been
selected because of the interest spread over a number of small area
there.

CELTIC Connections will have to go some to top this one. After
Sunday's triumphant return of Relativity it was tempting providence to
hope that this, probably the most keenly anticipated concert in the
series, would live up to expectations. But it did that and more.
Moving Hearts played a groove which, typically, sounded like they were
expecting the late Miles Davis as a special guest.
It wasn't the same band that recorded their classic, The Storm.
Captain Donal Lunny was missing. But he was there in spirit and
represented by his gorgeous Tribute to Peardar O'Donnel with Davy
Spillane's uillean pipes teasing out a melody fit to make you cry.
Talk about working an audience. For 45 minutes they hovered as if
stalking their prey, with drummer Matt Kelleghan subtly kicking the
elegiac Finore along and picking up the beat as Titanic eased into its
restrained hoedown of a finale. Then, to finish, they played The Lark, a
medley of glorious tune after glorious tune which almost imperceptibly
increased in intensity until the whole hall was rocking and the smiles
in the press row resembled Tony Blair's Spitting Image puppet.
Standing ovations are almost the norm at concerts these days. But the
one this masterly display earned was sincere and the two encores that
followed only reinforced the belief that sleeping dogs shouldn't always
be allowed to lie.

Rome, Friday
ITALIAN President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro today asked former Treasury
Minister Lamberto Dini to form a government, resolving a political
crisis that began when Silvio Berlusconi resigned as Prime Minister last
month.
Dini, who spent his career in the banking world before entering
government last May, pledged to form an administration of technocrats to
tackle the budget deficit, overhaul the pension system, and carry out
electoral reform.
Dini, 63, told reporters: ''I'm about to form a government which will
be free of party political ties. In substance, it will be a government
of technocrats.''
He added that the Government must produce a budget package to sustain
Italy's economic recovery and boost employment.
Dini accepted the nomination as Prime Minister-designate with the task
of forming a government. He will take office only after he has assembled
a Cabinet and won the backing of Parliament in a confidence vote.
The nomination of Dini ends a bitter political crisis provoked by the
resignation of billionaire businessman Berlusconi on December 22 after
only seven months in office.
Berlusconi, another political neophyte who stormed to victory in
General Elections last March, was brought down by a mutiny by his
Northern League coalition partner.
The coalition parties who remained loyal to Berlusconi's Freedom
Alliance demanded that Berlusconi must be reappointed or snap elections
called.
The League, plus opposition centrist and leftist parties, said that a
broad-based institutional government must be formed to pass key
institutional reforms.
Dini did not specify whether he expected his government to be merely
an interim one in the run-up to early polls, or to last longer.
Berlusconi, in an initial reaction to Dini's appointment, repeated his
call for early elections.
''Only a rapid return to the ballot box will create a coalition
government which is capable of ensuring full stability and political
authority,'' said Berlusconi.
''The idea of a brief truce, guaranteed by a government of
technocrats, can only be of use to the country in this framework,'' he
added.
Dini, who will head Italy's 54th government since the Second World
War, told reporters he would seek to ensure equal representation in the
media for all political parties.
Berlusconi owns three national television channels and his critics say
this makes a fair election campaign impossible.
Gianfranco Fini, leader of the far-right National Alliance and a
staunch Berlusconi ally, said that a Dini government would be the
prelude to early elections.
However Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, the man who did most to
unseat Berlusconi, said that elections were remote.
''So much water will flow under the bridge before elections are held
that Berlusconi will die of boredom and old age,'' said Bossi.
The former communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) indicated that
it would be prepared to back a Dini government providing it were
non-partisan.
Dini, who is not a member of any political party, has a far lower
public profile than the ever-smiling Berlusconi.
He is the second leading figure from the Bank of Italy to be selected
to be premier in the past two years. Former bank governor Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi was press-ganged into leading the country in 1993 at the height
of its corruption scandals.
During his seven months as Treasury Minister, the pale-faced Dini
backed strong measures to control inflation and reduce one of the
world's largest state debts.--Reuter.

A VIOLENT schizophrenic, who slashed a patient in a doctor's surgery
in a terrifying knife attack, was yesterday ordered to be detained
without limit of time in the State Hospital, Carstairs.
Following the attack at the surgery in Church Street, Coatbridge,
police took the unusual step of naming Michael Ferguson and issuing a
picture because of the danger he posed to the public.
Ferguson, 26, has previously absconded from a psychiatric hospital
where he was a patient following a court probation order, the High Court
at Edinburgh was told.
Ferguson, of no fixed address, admitted assaulting Mr Sean Pearson,
25, in the surgery on May 16 last year to his severe injury, permanent
disfigurement, and the danger of his life.
Mr Pearson needed treatment for a stab wound to his chest and 21
stitches for a face wound. He will be scarred for life.
At the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday, psychiatrists told Lord
MacLean that Ferguson is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.
Dr Janice Duncan, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the State
Hospital, said Ferguson suffered from delusions. He had told her that he
carried a knife when he felt threatened.
In her opinion, he represented a danger to the public because in the
past he had not been prepared to co-operate in his treatment and
suffered from an illness which could result in him behaving
aggressively, particularly as he was carrying a weapon.
Dr Duncan told the court that she had considered a claim by Ferguson
that he was faking his symptoms, but adhered to her diagnosis that he
was a paranoid schizophrenic.
Mr Alan Turnbull, Advocate-depute, said that Ferguson had a lengthy
list of previous convictions, including crimes of violence, for which he
had been jailed.
He argued that to protect the public from ''serious harm'' a
restriction order must be placed on his release and that it should be
without limit of time.
Mr Graham Robertson, defence counsel, told the court there was a
possibility that Ferguson could be transferred out of Carstairs within
six months if he made progress.
He argued that a period of three years would be long enough for
psychiatrists to exercise control over Ferguson's care and management.
Lord MacLean decided to make a hospital order without limit of time
since it would enable doctors to keep Ferguson under surveillance and
make sure that he took his prescribed medicine if released from
hospital.
The restriction without limit of time means that, if Ferguson is
allowed out of Carstairs at some point in the future, doctors will be
able to monitor his condition and recall him to hospital if he fails to
take his medication.

Minneapolis, Friday
THE daughter of assassinated black separatist Malcolm X may have been
lured into an alleged plot to kill her father's enemy -- Nation of Islam
leader Louis Farrakhan -- by a man seeking to stop the Government from
investigating him, it was reported today.
The ''hit man'' Qubilah Shabazz allegedly tried to hire was an
informant in a 1978 bombing plot in New York and a member of the Federal
Witness Protection Programme, according to sources close to the
investigation.
Shabazz's lawyer, Scott Tilsen, told the the Star Tribune newspaper in
Minneapolis that the man's actions amounted to ''enticing, seducing, and
luring her into the plot''. Tilson added that they acted to ''get out
from under an investigation for something totally unrelated''.
The Justice Department, which yesterday announced a nine-count
murder-for-hire indictment against Shabazz, has refused to reveal the
hit man's name or any details about him.
A source close to the case identified the man as Michael Fitzpatrick,
an informant in a 1978 bomb plot by Jewish militants against an Egyptian
tourism office in New York. It said he entered the Witness Protection
Programme afterwards and had lived in the Minneapolis area for years.
Tilsen told reporters that Shabazz had known the man since childhood.
He also said she claimed to be innocent of plotting to kill Farrakhan 30
years after she witnessed her father's assassination in 1965 when she
was four years old.
Her family has long blamed Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam for
Malcolm X's death -- something he and the group have steadfastly denied.
Shabazz, 34, was freed on bail of $10,000 (#6600).
News of the indictment stunned black communities in the US where
Malcolm X and Farrakhan are both held in high regard. Black leaders
urged against a rush to judgment.--Reuter.

A MINISTER has issued his congregation with street maps pinpointing
the homes of lapsed members.
The maps come with letters from the Rev Peter Youngson, urging regular
attenders to visit former church-goers and persuade them to return to
his services.
One lapsed Kirk member, Ms Agnes Cooper, said: ''This is very annoying
and I was not aware it was happening. It's my business whether I go to
church or not and nothing to do with anyone else.''
The map was drawn up after a census of his congregation carried out
over a four-week period at St Andrew's, Kirriemuir, Angus. Those who
attended filled in forms detailing their names and addresses.
Mr Youngson, 60, then consulted records of congregation members' names
and addresses. He ran off copies of a local street map and highlighted
all the homes of his congregation by ringing their addresses with a red
pen.
Those who had attended during the census period were singled out with
a red dot. Therefore, those who did not attend regularly stand out.
In his letter, he said: ''You will see there are a large number of
members, many of whom don't often come to church.
''You might decide to contact other regular worshippers in your
vicinity and arrange to get together to consider what can be done about
the folk who don't attend. You could make a point of trying to get to
know them better. You could try to tell them something of the real
crisis we know St Andrew's is facing.''
Mr Youngson, minister at the church for seven years, said the move
''gives regular attenders the chance to find out about neighbours they
did not realise were members and for them to tell their neighbours about
the crisis we're facing''. He added: ''Unless they use us more, we could
face closure.''
The presbytery clerk of Angus, the Rev Robert Ramsay, said: ''We've
received no complaints about what Mr Youngson has done.''

A JEWELLERY shop manageress and a police officer who continued to
challenge gunmen despite being shot yesterday received bravery awards at
a ceremony in Glasgow.
Ms Isabelle Anderson, 29, of Glasgow, and Constable Brian Williams,
36, of Clarkston, were among 18 people, including 12 police officers,
who received the Strathclyde Regional Medal for Bravery from Councillor
William Perry, the local authority's convener.
Ms Anderson was shot in the leg as she tackled a masked man who had
ordered her at gunpoint to fill a sportsbag with jewellery in July 1993.
She continued to wrestle with her attacker after being shot and
managed to get him out the door of the jewellers in Argyle Arcade,
Glasgow, where she began screaming. Two other men grabbed him until
armed police arrived.
The shot left her with 36 abrasions on her leg. She said: ''I think it
was fear that made me do it.
''He entered the shop, pointed a sawn-off shotgun in my face, and
said: 'Put the gold in the bag'. I took it and walked towards where the
jewellery was, but then turned and just grabbed the gun and tried to
point it to the floor.
''He then fired a shot through my skirt which hit my leg.'' Ms
Anderson said she kept trying to grab the gun which the man was forcing
into her stomach. She struggled with him out on to the street and began
screaming.
''The next thing I knew there were a couple of men helping me. I was
told the gunman fired a second shot, but I didn't hear it in the
excitement.
''By that time, I was very tired. The men managed to get the gun off
him and within a few seconds armed police had arrived and made an
arrest.''
The gunman was later jailed for seven years at the High Court in
Glasgow.
Ms Anderson has also received a special commendation from the chief
constable of Strathclyde and a certificate of commendation from Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang.
Mr Williams was shot in the hand while pursuing a gunman who had shot
dead an Asian shopkeeper and attempted to rob a bakers in Main Street,
Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, in May, 1993.
The gunman pointed the gun at the police officer's head but he put his
hand up to protect himself and the bullet was deflected by his
watchstrap.
Mr Williams, who is married with a two-year-old son, said he had not
had a full night's sleep since the shooting.
''I ran after him and he turned round and shot at me but missed,'' he
said.
''Then a woman shouted 'Don't shoot the policeman' and he turned the
gun off me and shot her through the legs.
''I went for him again and got within about 10ft of him when he
pointed a .44 magnum revolver at my head and pulled the trigger.
''I just put my hand up. It was an instant reaction. Fortunately, the
bullet was deflected by my watch strap.''
The gunman was later jailed for life at the High Court in Glasgow.

Washington, Friday
HERE'S a depressing piece of news: the American 1996 presidential
campaign is getting under way. One leading Republican candidate has
dropped out of the race, two others are about to announce their
candidacies formally, and a handful of others are hovering in the wings.
Meanwhile, President Clinton's supporters are scurrying around telling
everyone that there is no chance, none at all, that some other Democrat
might run against him.
Two-year campaigns are now the norm. Mr Clinton is president today
because he started running immediately after the party convention in
1988, assuming that Michael Dukakis was going to lose (he did); and kept
it up through 1991, the year of the Gulf War, when other possible
Democratic candidates concluded that George Bush was unbeatable.
Mr Clinton looks exceedingly vulnerable now, so why has Dick Cheney,
former White House chief of staff, congressman, and secretary of
defence, bowed out? The same reason that Jack Kemp, another former
congressman and member of the Bush administration, is having second
thoughts: he needs to raise at least $50,000 (#33,000) a day for the
next year to stand a chance.
Mr Cheney couldn't face the endless procession of fund-raising events
he would need, and Mr Kemp doesn't feel up to it, either. The two who
seem determined to run are Senators Phil Gramm of Texas and Bob Dole of
Kansas.
Senator Gramm has already raised a great deal of money and is on the
fast track to acquire the rest of it in plenty of time for the
primaries. He is, so far, the most prominent right-winger in the race.
Senator Dole is Republican leader in the Senate and can probably raise
the money because of that fact.
As for Dan Quayle, former vice-president and best-known light-weight
in American politics, he is recovering from having his appendix out but
will probably get into the race this spring and will be followed by
Lamar Alexander, a former governor of Tennessee.
The looney-tunes, people like Pat Robertson and Pat Buchanan, may once
again produce a candidate this time, but it doesn't look as though they
will have much more than nuisance value, like last time.
What is striking about this list is that there is not a strong
candidate among them. It is very consoling for Mr Clinton.
Mr Gramm is a dour, dull fanatic, quite lacking in even the quirky
humour that kept Ross Perot afloat as a candidate in 1992.
Mr Dole has been running since 1976, is the last veteran of the Second
World War in national politics, and showed in 1988 that he is not good
at presidential races.
Mr Alexander is running on the simple slogan that all our problems
stem from congressional corruption and his proposal is: ''Cut their pay
and send them home.'' That will not echo so well among Republicans now
that there is a Republican Congress.
On the other hand, really obscure southern governors have made it to
the White House twice in 20 years, so don't count him out. Don't count
Dan Quayle out, either. A lot of people out there like him and he might
well win the nomination by default. Mr Clinton says a little prayer
every evening that he will.
However, one of those potential candidates is already making far more
news than all the other party leaders combined, and the first ''Newt for
President'' buttons have already appeared. Later this year, when the
Republicans grow desperate, they will start nagging Newt Gingrich to
give up his new position as Speaker of the House and run for president.
He doesn't rule it out. He loves being Speaker, but it is quite
possible that in six months he might try to trade up -- and he is one of
the two men who could probably raise the necessary money in a last,
sudden rush.
The other is Colin Powell, former chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff, who is in the position of General Eisenhower in the late 40s:
both parties would like to nominate him for president.
No-one knows what party he votes for. He is tabula rasa on whom party
dreamers can sketch the outlines of the perfect candidate. He makes Bob
Dole (not to mention Bill Clinton) very nervous.
No-one has yet come out to say the president cannot win and that the
party needs a new candidate -- partly because there are only two
conceivable alternatives, Al Gore and Colin Powell. Mr Gore will stay
loyal, and General Powell is writing his memoirs (for a $6m advance) and
won't commit himself: but it could happen, if this year goes really
badly for Mr Clinton.
Washington is full of the sounds of battle in Congress, as the new
Republican majority struts its stuff, but the wheel of American politics
is already turning, and the ritual of speculation, conspiracy, ambitions
frustrated, and wild hopes is upon us again. Watch this space.

Dhaka, Saturday
MORE than 100 people were feared killed when two passenger trains
crashed head-on in northern Bangladesh.
Rescue services had retrieved 20 bodies from the mangled wreckage of
the trains, but the death toll was expected to rise to more than 100 in
the disaster, which occurred last night in Dinajpur district, railway
officials said.
About 150 other people were injured in the crash near the town of
Hilly. A fast-moving passenger train bound for south-western Khulna
collided with a stationary local train packed with passengers, first
reports said.
''Immediate rescue operations have found more than 20 dead bodies from
the crumpled railway wagons and it is feared that the death toll may go
up to well over 100 when all the debris is sifted through at the site,''
one official told reporters.
The officials could not immediately say what had caused the crash.
They were trying to organise the rescue with the help of local villagers
and police.
In January, 1989, a total of 135 people were killed and more than 1000
injured in Bangladesh's worst rail disaster when two packed express
trains crashed head-on.--Reuter/AP.

MANILA: Police are looking for 20 foreigners allegedly involved in a

Philippines capital reported that the group was led by an ''Arab
electronics expert'', a 26-year-old Pakistani born in Kuwait of
Palestinian parents and trained in Libya and Syria. He was said to have
escaped a police raid on a flat near the Papal Nunciature, where the
Pope is staying. The Pope arrived in Manila on Thursday to a tumultuous
welcome on the first leg of his 11-day Asian tour.

<RECORDNO>980369664</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE jury in the trial of two suspected IRA terrorists was yesterday
told a ''hidden agenda'' was being followed in the gathering of evidence
against one of them.
Defence counsel Mr Michael Mansfield, QC, accused police officers and
the Army of following the agenda as they built up their case against
Scotsman Mr Hugh Jack.
It is alleged Mr Jack helped plot a bombing campaign with his
co-defendant and when the plot was discovered he tried to hide the
evidence -- a bag of explosives and detonators -- in woods near his
workplace.
A bag was found in Gartinny Woods, outside Mr Jack's home town,
Sauchie, near Alloa.
But in his closing speech to the jury, Mr Mansfield denied it was
placed there by his client.
As he picked through the evidence, he spoke of witnesses being
''economical with the truth''. He said there was clear evidence of the
''hidden agenda'' as investigators tried to connect Mr Jack with the
holdall, which was discovered three days after his arrest.
Throughout the trial, Mr Jack has claimed he was an innocent dupe,
unaware of the activities of Mr Robert Fryers, who was a guest at his
flat at Lochbrae, Sauchie.
Mr Fryers was arrested on July 14, 1993, in Hendon, north west London,
with a 2.5kg bomb in his bag.
No evidence has been given in his defence although he denies
conspiring to cause explosions.
Yesterday, Mr Mansfield replayed clips from an MI5 surveillance video
which had been set up to monitor the comings and goings at Lochbrae.
The Crown claims this shows Mr Jack leaving his flat with ''the
holdall'' on the day of Mr Fryers's arrest.
But Mr Mansfield claims the bag shown is in fact a black plastic bag
containing wellington boots and other items.
He reminded the jury that two police officers, who were also watching
the front door from a surveillance car, only spoke of ''a bag'' in their
first reports.
Detective Constable Forest Sloan and PC Douglas Telfer later claimed
the bag was a holdall but Mr Mansfield questioned their evidence.
As for the discovery of the bag, Mr Mansfield said the officer
supervising the search of the area around Gartinny Woods and the
Gartmorn Hill Turkey Farm, where Mr Jack worked, had ''opened a tin of
sardines''. Mr Mansfield reminded the jury all contemporaneous notes of
the search had been destroyed.
Mr Mansfield asked the jury to consider why Army chiefs who supervised
soldiers in the search had not been called to give evidence.
He then reminded the jury no traces of explosives had been found on Mr
Jack when he was arrested.
Mr Mansfield said his client admitted driving Mr Fryers to public
phone boxes miles from Sauchie to make calls and to receiving phone
calls from Mr Fryers in the same way.
But Mr Mansfield maintained this was because Mr Jack had been told Mr
Fryers was on the run from moneylenders in London.
The trial continues.

Sarajevo, Friday
THE big powers raced today to win support from the Serbs for the
latest Bosnia peace moves as a fresh crisis loomed with Croatia's
decision to throw out UN peacekeepers.
On top of that, UN efforts to bring together the warring Bosnian sides
ran into yet another obstacle when the Bosnian Serbs refused to allow
commercial traffic into Sarajevo.
Meanwhile UN officials saw little chance that Croatia would change its
mind on expelling 15,000 UN troops. They said its ultimatum left little
room for manoeuvre and that they had already started preparations for
the withdrawal.
''We are working on the assumption that the Croatian Government's
decision is final. The assessment is that we will not have a job to do
after March 31 and we cannot wait till then to do preparations,'' said
UN spokesman Michael Williams.
The Security Council was to meet later to discuss President Franjo
Tudjman's decision. He told UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
that the partition of his country by rebel Serbs who have seized tracts
of land was untenable, and that UN troops served only to solidify Serb
gains.
Serbs in the Krajina region of Croatia hold one-third of the country
and Tudjman's Government has no control over them.
A UN spokesman warned that withdrawal from the four UN Protected Areas
controlled by Serbs could run into difficulties.
''It will be extremely difficult for us to leave in a clean manner
from UNPAs if the local population opposed it,'' he said. ''The pressure
on Serbs will rise if we pull out.''
The leader of the rebel Krajina Serbs, Milan Martic, said Tudjman's
move was intended to push the Security Council into exerting pressure on
them to accept a bad deal.
He said the Serbs would gladly allow the UN troops to stay on their
territory, but also promised the local population that the local Krajina
army was capable of defending itself if the peacekeepers left.
UN officials fear the departure of the UN force could not only trigger
a fresh war with the rebel Serbs and involve the rump Yugoslav army, but
could also jeopardise the latest general ceasefire in Bosnia's much
bloodier conflict.
In Bosnia, envoys from the five-nation ''Contact Group'', which
includes Britain, met Bosnian Serb military and political leaders into
the evening to try to persuade them to accept a modified peace plan.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said the talks were overshadowed
by a Security Council decision to ''punish'' Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia
by denying them shipments of oil from Serbia.
Nevertheless Karadzic added: ''I am afraid the last seven or eight
months have been in vain, but I hope the upcoming four months will
result in satisfactory steps.''
The warring sides in Bosnia have signed a four-month ceasefire
intended to provide a pause for peace talks.
The envoys from Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and the United
States briefed the Muslim-led Bosnian Government on the peace plan
yesterday and were due to hold more talks in Sarajevo tonight.
The plan is now being called a starting point for further negotiation,
instead of the ''take-it-or-leave-it'' deal originally presented.
This has dismayed the Bosnian Government, which says it will not let
the Big Powers retreat from the plan in order to appease the
Serbs.--Reuter.

surgery after bad luck turned into a fortune. A week ago a drug addict
stole #1000 worth of tickets from Cortes in Madrid. He was forced to

Later, however, police caught the thief and recovered the tickets which
included winning numbers worth a total of #250,000. The windfall means
that Cortes can now take his six-year-old son Luis to hospital in

can't say whether he moved it all in one go or a bag at a time, but
there were 119 big bags of hash in his larder,'' said a police
spokesman.

Moscow, Friday
RUSSIAN artillery blasted the devastated capital of separatist
Chechnya and the Kremlin said only a few stubborn pockets of rebel
resistance remained.
Correspondents in Grozny said Russian shellfire struck even the few
remaining areas previously untouched by the laborious drive to capture
the city launched after a disastrous New Year tank-led assault.
Television pictures showed huge blasts wrecking the city's bus
station, from where city residents had been fleeing to mountain
retreats. Apartment blocks were ablaze.
''In two days of constant bombardment, everything that was left to
destroy has been destroyed,'' said a reporter for Ostankino television,
cowering in an courtyard with shattered beams and concrete slabs around
him.
Today's fighting was some of the worst since President Boris Yeltsin
sent troops into Chechnya on December 11 to crush the region's bid to
throw off Russian rule.
Increasingly confident Russian Government statements said the
Kremlin's troops controlled most of the centre of what had been a city
of 400,000.
The Defence Ministry said Russian forces had captured the Chechen
Government headquarters, a ''key target'' next to separatist leader
President Dzhokhar Dudayev's palace.
Justice Minister Valentin Kovalyov said Russian troops were meeting
resistance only from the palace -- symbol of Chechen resistance -- and
three other buildings in the city centre.
''Defence Ministry units will finish their task of disarming illegal
armed groups in Chechnya within one week,'' Kovalyov told a news
conference.
Government statements have proved to be exaggerated or false in just
over a month of fighting. However, Russian forces appeared to be making
good progress towards capturing the city and ousting Dudayev, who
proclaimed Chechnya independent in October 1991.
In a further sign of a decisive Russian offensive, a military source
told Interfax news agency a column of 77 armoured vehicles and 59 troop
carriers was heading for Grozny from neighbouring Ingushetia as
reinforcements.
The military campaign, its mass destruction and bloodshed have
gradually persuaded Western countries to temper their reluctance to call
Moscow to account for fear of undermining Yeltsin.
US President Bill Clinton called on both sides in the conflict ''to
stop spilling blood and start making peace''. His Defence Secretary
William Perry said the fighting could generate instability in other
Russian regions.
In Moscow, the lower House of Russia's Parliament, the State Duma,
called overwhelmingly on Yeltsin to stop the conflict and come up with a
peaceful settlement. A lone MP voted against.
Yeltsin ignored a similar appeal late last year.
Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev defended the campaign, in a speech in
Novgorod, north-west of Moscow, saying the path to national unity
''sometimes leads through tragedy and blood''.
''We are not the first or the only ones to spill blood to keep our
state intact,'' he said.
The country's human rights commissioner, Sergei Kovalyov, the most
vocal opponent of the Kremlin campaign, said Russian shelling sought to
''crush the people and destroy the city''.
''But seizing a wrecked city is only the beginning of the Chechen
conflict with Russia or even, if you will, a Caucasus war,'' Interfax
news agency reported him as telling reporters in Ingushetia.--Reuter.

GOVERNMENT hopes of quickly reuniting the nine Euro-rebel MPs with the
rest of the parliamentary party are likely to founder over a Commons
vote on fishing next Wednesday in which few, if any, of the rebels are
expected to support Ministers.
Other Conservative MPs, furious at the admission of 40 additional
Spanish fishing boats into Britain's traditional west coast fishing
waters, could also decide not to back the Government when its
negotiating tactics come under fire in a debate initiated by the Labour
Opposition.
Most of the rebels indicated that they thought the right approach by
the Government would be for the Chief Whip, Mr Richard Ryder, to call
them in together and discuss their concerns about the Government's
policy towards the European Union.
The Prime Minister, after earlier suggesting that a lengthy period of
loyal voting would have to precede restoration of the party whip, took a
softer line last weekend, talking in terms of weeks rather than months
for a reconciliation.
Eight of the rebels lost the whip when they failed to support the
Government in a vote on a Bill increasing Britain's payments to EU and
the ninth, Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston) voluntarily resigned
the whip.
Recent opinion polls have shown that the perception of the
Conservatives as disunited has grown among voters, and party organisers
are anxious to put that right. However, the Cabinet itself is divided
between Ministers who argue for a speedy return for the rebels and those
who believe they cannot be let off lightly for refusing to support the
Government in a vote of confidence.
Conservative Central Office denied a BBC radio report that there was a
plan to bring five of the rebels, who last Wednesday voted with the
Government to keep its majority of one on the Commons Standing
Committees, back into the parliamentary party by the end of this month.
It was suggested that each of the five was to be allocated a
back-bench Tory MP as a ''nurse'' to keep them informed of business
arrangements and encourage them to make their peace with the Government
whips.
Apart from the fact that all the rebels have regular contact with
other Conservatives MPs and have no difficulty keeping track of
important votes, they have shown no anxiety about remaining in the
wilderness for some time longer.
Indeed one, Mr John Wilkinson, MP for Ruislip-Norwood, said on BBC
Radio Four's World At One progamme that, as a recent newspaper opinion
poll showed that the rebels enjoyed 62% support in their constituencies
while the Government's national rating was at 18%, ''I think they should
join us rather than we joining them''.
Although they insist they are not an organised group, the rebels
regularly meet to consult on tactics, and will resist any attempts to
split them. It has been suggested that the five who backed the
Government in the committee numbers vote would have a better chance of a
swift return to the ranks than the four who did not.
Mrs Teresa Gorman (Billericay), who abstained, said: ''We want the
whip back, but want it back together. I think most of my male
colleaugues are men who can be trusted, and we are staunch patriotic
Conservatives.
''We are one group of people who have been foolishly treated by the
very immature group of people who are running the country at the
moment.''
Mr Wilkinson said the whip had been removed in an ''unprecedented and
irrational manner''. Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North) who abstained in
Wednesday's vote said: ''There's going to be no prospect of divide and
rule. We are where we are because we have taken a very strong view on a
point of principle and we will stay together on that point of
principle.''
The rebel thought keenest to have the whip restored is Mr Nicholas
Budgen (Wolverhampton South West) who may have been the object of a
reference by Mr Marlow in a radio interview that there was a possibility
that one of the group would return to the fold ahead of the others.
However, next week's vote on fishing looks more likely to emphasise
Tory disunity on matters European.

AN EAST Kilbride hill walker was found dead yesterday near the summit
of Ben More, near Crianlarich. The body of Mr William Cameron, 61, of
Coleridge, Newlands Muir, was found by members of RAF Leuchars mountain
rescue team .
A team member said it looked as though Mr Cameron, described by his
family as ''an experienced hillwalker'', may have slipped. Conditions on
the 3852ft mountain are understood to have been wet and windy on
Thursday.
The cause of his death has not yet been established. A post-mortem
examination is expected to be carried out today.
He is the second person to die in a Scottish mountain accident this
year. Mr William Stewart, 44, from Lauder, in the Borders, was killed on
January 2 when he slipped and fell several hundred feet on Stob Diamh,
Ben Cruachan, near Dalmally, Argyll.
Relatives of Mr Cameron, who worked with Scottish Nuclear before
taking early retirement, travelled to Stirling Royal Infirmary yesterday
to identify his body. They were too upset to speak last night.
One of Mr Cameron's daughter's, Sheena, is understood to have raised
the alarm at about 8pm on Thursday when he failed to return home from a
lone walking expedition.
Police found his car parked at the bottom of Ben More and members of
Killin Mountain Rescue Team began an immediate search of the area. But
it was called off about 11.30pm.
A police spokeswoman said about 70 rescuers resumed the search
yesterday at 8am. They were joined by a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter
from HMS Gannet in Prestwick.
Meanwhile, Mr Andrew Ogilvie, 27, from Thornwood Road, Glasgow, was in
a stable condition in Vale of Leven Hospital, Alexandria, yesterday
after fracturing his pelvis in a 40ft fall on Ben Ime, near Arrochar.
He had been rock climbing with his companion, Mr Ewan Robertson, of
Eaglesham, on Thursday when he fell after being struck by a small fall
of ice and packed snow. Mr Robertson, who was unhurt, raised the alarm
at a farmhouse.
Rescuers carried Mr Ogilvie down the mountain to a Sea King rescue
helicopter from Prestwick which flew him to hospital.

AN OIL tanker which developed a 30ft crack in its bow after leaving
Shetland for the United States was last night being escorted to safety.
The Norwegian-registered Mimosa, which left Sullom Voe on Wednesday
carrying more than 330,000 tonnes of crude oil, is being accompanied by
a Stornoway-based Coastguard tug and will be taken to Lyme Bay off the
Dorset and Devon coast.
Irish authorities gave the Mimosa orders to keep 65 miles away from
their coastline and sent one of their naval vessels, the L E Eithne, to
shadow the tanker.
The Eithne's commander, Mr Frank Lynch, said there was no evidence of
pollution. ''Every precaution is being made to ensure there is no
leakage.''
The British Marine Pollution Control Unit was also closely monitoring
the situation.
The crack is in the plating on the port side of the forepeak tank,
below the waterline. This tank had been empty, but an estimated 8300
gallons of seawater has already flooded through the crack.
A Clyde Coastguard spokesman said they would remain in contact with
the tug which would escort the tanker all the way to Lyme Bay.
The tanker is 362 metres long with a 60-metre beam and a draught of 71
metres. She carries a crew of 31.
There are unconfirmed reports that the Mimosa was hit by an Exocet
missile during the Gulf War, and that it went to Dubai for repairs last
summer.
The Coastguard tug is one of two commissioned by the Government for
stand-by duty to deal with any emergencies with shipping off the British
coast, following the inquiry by Lord Donaldson into the Braer Disaster
in Shetland.

THE leader of Tayside Regional Council has called for the introduction
of a means test to stop wealthy landowners receiving public grants.
Mr Ewan Dow made his call after his council backed an application by
the Duke of Atholl to seek #400,000 in forestry grants to plant mixed
woodland on his 135,000-acre Perthshire estate.
Mr Dow said the council's planning committee, which unanimously
supported the application, had no choice because the application fitted
in with planning policy.
However, the duke's request for aid to plant trees at Glen Bruar near
the Falls of Bruar beauty spot has sparked a political storm.
The duke is one of Scotland's richest men with a personal fortune
estimated at #140m.
He was granted public money in 1992 when he applied for grants of
#300,000 to restore a nine-acre garden at his family seat at Blair
Castle.
Mr Dow said last night: ''Personally, I deplore the means tests which
are inflicted on the poorest and needy in our society. But this would
seem to be a case where there is a crying need for such a test.
''It is unfortunate that public bodies which want to support
environmentally-friendly tree planting have to consent to handing over
huge sums of public money to people who are fabulously wealthy.''
Scottish forestry workers leader Mr Hugh Wilson, of the Transport and
General Workers Union, added his voice to the protest.
He said, ''The duke may be the president of the National Trust for
Scotland but he obviously believes that charity begins at home. These
large sums of public cash should be used to develop the nation's
Forestry Commission assets and not to pander to wealthy aristocrats.''

A PATIENT at Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary, believed to be an
elderly man, has died of a rare form of Legionnaires' disease.
Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary NHS Trust said last night that
the patient, whose identity was not revealed, had also been suffering
from other ''very serious'' medical conditions and was likely to have
had the Legionnaires' infection at the time of admission to the
hospital.
In a statement released last night, the trust said: ''Appropriate
investigations by the Department of Public Health Medicine at Forth
Valley Health Board are in hand to identify any possible source of
infection in the community.''
The statement added that the particular type of organism involved is
''very rare'' and stressed there is no known case of person-to-person
transmission in Legionnaires' disease.
A spokeswoman for Forth Valley Health Board said the Department of
Public Health Medicine was working with Falkirk District Council's
environmental health department and an investigation has begun to
establish the source of the infection.
The spokeswoman added: ''Following notification, the environmental
health department have now arranged for appropriate water samples to be
submitted to Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, and further information will be
given as the results of tests become known.'' The results are expected
next week.
A 78-year-old man died following an outbreak of the disease in the
west of Edinburgh last month.

DETECTIVES investigating the murder of a man in the East End of
Glasgow earlier this week are calling on a bus passenger, who may have
important information, to contact them.
Strathclyde Police said yesterday that they have established that a
bus operated by Whitelaw Coaches a shooting in Tollcross Road at about
7.25am on Wednesday. The bus was the 345 service from Strathaven to the
centre of Glasgow.
Police said it appeared that a man, who later alighted from the bus in
George Square, Glasgow, spoke to the driver about the shooting and have
urged him to come forward.
They also appealed to any other bus passengers who might have seen
anything about the shooting to contact them at Shettleston police
office.
Mr William Dearie, 32, was waiting for a lift to work near his home in
Tollcross Road, near Parkhead Cross, at about 7.25am on Wednesday when a
gunman ran up and shot him in the back. He was taken by ambulance to the
Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, where he died later.
Detective Superintendent John Campbell, who is leading the inquiry,
said: ''There were a number of buses passing at the time and we would
urge anyone who saw anything suspicious to contact us immediately.''
He said that the police had so far received a good response from the
public.Pedestrians and people travelling through the area were stopped
and questioned by police officers on Thursday morning.
Mr Campbell added: ''Several people have been interviewed and have
given us some valuable information.''

STRATHCLYDE'S 400,000 pensioners went to war yesterday in an attempt
to save their right to concessionary travel.
They are worried that large parts of the region will be cut off from
cheap fares on the buses, trains, and ferries when local government
reform in Scotland comes fully into operation next year.
Under the changes, the present Strathclyde Passenger Transport
Executive will be replaced by a new Passenger Transport Authority.
The Scottish Office is currently consulting with interested parties
over the boundary for the new transport operation but Strathclyde
Elderly Forum fears that Ministers have already decided to go for a
solution which will mean large parts of the region will be left out of
the PTA.
Yesterday, a delegation from the forum, led by the Labour MP for
Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, Mr George Foulkes, met Scottish
Transport Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton in Edinburgh. During an
hour-long meeting, they insisted the new PTA should cover the whole of
the existing region.
Mr Foulkes, chairman of the All Party Pensioners Committee, said the
Minister had told them that there had been wide consultation and that a
decision should be announced in April.
However, the impression was that most of South Lanarkshire, East
Ayrshire, including Kilmarnock, and most of South Ayrshire, would be
left out of the new structure.
''At present, the elderly in Strathclyde enjoy one of the best
concessionary schemes in Scotland. They can travel 10 miles on buses,
trains, and ferries anywhere in the region for just 25p. It is vital
this provision be maintained.
''The fear is that if the whole of Strathclyde is not included in the
new PTA boundary, smaller authorities outside the designated area may
not be able to afford to subsidise a concessionary travel scheme. In the
rural areas, this would result in the elderly becoming even more
isolated,'' he said.
The Scottish Office denied last night Ministers had already made up
their minds about the boundary and said Lord James would consider the
points made in reaching a decision.

A 24-YEAR-OLD woman yesterday told the High Court in Edinburgh of
death threats made to her as she was stabbed and raped.
The woman claimed that minutes before being raped in a hotel chalet
she was stabbed in the abdomen and her intestines were ''hanging out''
during the sex attack.
She told the court that her alleged attacker, Mr Wayne Williamson,
sneered when she told him she was in agony with the pain of her wound
and continued the attack.
She alleged he told her ''I could not give a f..k what I did to you.''
She also alleged Mr Williamson told her he would kill her if she
screamed.
She told the court: ''He put his full weight on me. I cannot describe
the pain I felt on the injury. It was horrendous. I did not know whether
he had the knife in his hand. He could have finished me off.''
She alleged that Mr Williamson had come to her chalet after midnight
as she was preparing for bed. She said she knew him and let him in so
that he could talk over his problems.
She told the court that he left soon afterwards but returned later and
said he was looking for a lost key. She added that, when she went into
the chalet to look for it, Mr Williamson entered behind her and she saw
he had a large hunting knife in his hand.
She added that she tried to get hold of his other hand and they began
struggling. She said she felt a burning ache in her abdomen. The woman
told the court: ''I knew that my days were numbered and that he was
setting out to kill me. The next thing I remember was lying sideways
across the bed on all fours. I was waiting for the knife going into my
back to finish me off.
''I looked down to see what was the burning ache and I actually saw my
intestines lying in my hand.''
She said Mr Williamson was a hotel worker at the Gretna Hall Hotel,
Gretna, Dumfries.
Mr Williamson, 25, described as a prisoner at Dumfries, denies
assaulting and raping the woman in a chalet at Gretna Hall Hotel on
September 26 last year. He has also denied breaking conditions of bail.
Dr John Burnett, 24, a senior house officer at Cumberland Royal
Infirmary, told the court that he examined the woman in the accident and
emergency unit at the hospital.
He found that she had multiple stab wounds. They included two wounds
in the lower abdomen and one under her right breast.
Dr Burnett said it was very obvious that part of her intestines were
protruding from one of the abdominal wounds. The woman was operated on
immediately and then was in intensive care.
The trial before Lord Mayfield continues.

<HEADLINE>Ex-welder plans to reclaim estate properties in Strathclyde. Title winning tactics earn #440,000</HEADLINE>

A FORMER North Sea welder, who bought an estate title in the
North-east for #8000 and has since netted around #440,000 profit by
reclaiming properties on it for which the owners did not have proper
title, is planning to do the same in Strathclyde.
Mr Brian Hamilton said he had already bought his second estate title,
although he declined to name it, and anticipated the return would be
similar to the one in Huntly.
He said no-one had been evicted as a result of his actions and no
individual had lost money. ''Insurance companies lost money but they
insured the risk and that is the business they are in,'' he said.
Yesterday, he won a court battle with Grampian Regional Council over
the ownership of a former school and schoolhouse.
A judge ruled that Mr Hamilton, of The Park, Cammachmore, Stonehaven,
has established a claim to the site of Lesmore School at Rhynie,
Aberdeenshire.
Mr Hamilton has already received #125,000 in compensation from
Grampian Regional Council over a piece of land and schoolhouse at
Kinnoir, near Huntly, which the council had sold. He has been awarded
vacant possession of two houses at Longhill and reached an out-of-court
settlement with an insurance company about a schoolhouse at Cairnie and
one at Drumblade.
In the latter cases, he also claimed title to the schools, which were
in operation. He said yesterday he had subsequently granted title of the
schools to the regional council for a nominal fee.
Mr Hamilton said that in relation to Huntly Estate he had carried out
research on the titles and had entered agreements with the former owners
to recover their properties.
''I did all the work and took all the risks and my risks have been
rewarded,'' he said. ''To get involved in any court action is a big
risk. I researched the properties, found out who the former owners were,
and came to an arrangement with them. If I could do it, so could have
the regional council.''
In the latest case, Lord Clyde heard at the Court of Session that in
1858 the fifth Duke of Richmond and Lennox conveyed the land to trustees
so that it could be used as a school for the poor, for the residence of
a teacher, and for no other purpose.
The school and schoolhouse were built on the site and were in use
until 1963 when Aberdeen County Council decided that it should close.
The site was initially leased, then sold by the council to a local
farmer and through him, in 1986, to the late Mr David Thow. Since that
time, the buildings have been used for storage. Mr Hamilton argued that
after the closure of the school, ownership of the site reverted to the
Duke of Richmond and his successors.
He said that in 1936 it had been included in land sold by the ninth
Duke to Garnet and William Lambert, from whose executors he had acquired
it in 1991.
He asked Lord Clyde to declare that he was the true owner, but this
was disputed by Grampian region and by Mr Thow's beneficiary, Mr John
Thow, of Milton of Lesmore, by Huntly.
The council claimed that the school had not been included in the deal
between the ninth Duke and the Lamberts, through which Mr Hamilton based
his claim.
However, Lord Clyde ruled that on the information placed before the
court the school site formed part of lands which passed through the
Lamberts to Mr Hamilton, which made him the successor to the original
granter of the deed of 1858.
Mr Hamilton had established that he was now the owner of the land.
Mr Hamilton said yesterday he believed the property could be worth as
much as #50,000, perhaps even more but that he had only seen it from a
distance around three years ago. It was on an ''idyllic spot''.
The region had given a guarantee of good title to their purchaser, who
was now dead, and they could offer his beneficiaries compensation or
purchase the property from Mr Hamilton.
Mr Hamilton said that if people were prepared to buy and sell
properties they did not own, then they were taking a risk. He said the
only individuals who might suffer as a result of his actions were those
who had not bought in good faith.
''I have one case just now where a person purchased for about one
quarter of the market value because there was no proper title.'' He said
it had to be remembered that every time someone sold a property which
was not rightly theirs, ''there was a loser''.
He said the publicity which had resulted from the Huntly Estate had
led to a number of people contacting him on a very regular basis and he
was involved in a number of projects throughout Scotland.
''People are very interested in their own property,'' he said,
''Especially if someone else is occupying it.''
Mr Hamilton said that initially he had identified potential estates
through ''basic research, hard work and a variety of sources''. More and
more now he was contacted by estate owners who wanted him to look at
their holdings or even solictors who asked him to become involved for a
client.
He believed there could be unclaimed assets on many Scottish estates,
and by estates he meant anything from a house and garden to 20,000
acres.
''I suppose you could liken me to the golfer to whom a reporter once
said: 'You're a very lucky golfer' and he replied 'Yes, and the more I

but on some the lawyers had been spot on and and kept meticulous
records.

THE Prince of Wales encountered a touch of romance, albeit of the
Mills and Boon variety, when he officially opened the #6.5m A K Bell
Library in Perth, yesterday.
On his tour of the building, he stopped to talk to Mrs Doreen
Laughlin, and Mrs Elizabeth Southwood, of WRVS, manning their stand
beside the M &amp; B section, where he picked up a copy.
Mrs Laughlin said later the Prince had asked whether she ever read
them. ''I told him 'Certainly not', and he laughed. We explained that we
helped deliver books to the housebound,'' she said.
It was perhaps an unfortunate stop for the Prince. Alongside his
selection, The Pirate, were such as A Trusting Heart, Gracious Lady, and
Temptation. In the adjoining aisle were books on Diana.
It was his first visit to Scotland since the Parker Bowles divorce
announcement. He was welcomed by Lady Provost Mrs Jean McCormack, and
stopped to talk to several people in a crowd of about 100, one of whom
presented him with a red carnation.
In the library, before unveling a plaque, he accepted gifts from the
pupils of Caledonian Road-Craigie Primary Schools, for Prince William
and Prince Harry.
Later, he walked to the Caledonian Court Housing Association
development, a complex for the physically handicapped.
En route, he again stopped on several occasions to talk to people.
No-one in polite Perth wished to ask about the future of the monarchy
and the latest revelations that Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles is to divorce.

A federal structure for the United Kingdom would be one of three
options more logical than Labour's proposals for Scottish devolution, Mr
Rifkind will claim tonight.
In his contribution to the Government's intensifying attack on
constitutional change, the former Scottish Secretary will accuse Labour
of pursuing a dishonest policy, dictated by short-term political
opportunism.
Mr Major's promise to MPs to fight devolution ''lock, stock, and
barrel'' has prompted his Ministers to embark on a sustained campaign
aimed at unifying the Tories behind the Union.
On Thursday, Mr Rifkind was cited by Labour in the Commons as one of
the ''dangerous teenage madmen'' in the Cabinet who in the 1970s
supported devolution for Scotland and a federal solution for Britain. In
December 1976, Mr Rifkind resigned as Scottish Conservative spokesman on
devolution over Mrs Thatcher's decision to vote against it.
His speech tonight to the Angus East Conservative Association will be
his first public statement on devolution since the issue exploded at
Prime Minister's Questions this week.
Mr Rifkind plans to accuse Labour of pursuing an illogical policy and
will say: ''The logical choice is the same today as it was in the 1970s.
Britain can continue to be a unitary state; alternatively there could be
a federal structure for the whole of the UK; or the Union could be
terminated.''
He will suggest that the constitutional change Labour is proposing
will make Scotland the most heavily-taxed part of Britain and lead to
poor government and nationalist mischief.
Last night, at least six Ministers were speaking out against Labour's
proposals in speeches across the country. All emphasised the threat to
the Union posed by reforms which one described as ''sheer folly''.
However, Mr Major's claim that the British people would resist any
change in the status quo was weakened yesterday by a Gallup poll
published in the Daily Telegraph which showed support among voters for a
Scottish parliament at 51%. The poll also found 42% believed devolution
would lead to the break-up of the UK.
Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell said Labour was tinkering with the
constitution for party political advantage. ''Their proposals to
introduce devolution in Scotland and Wales would build dangerous new
pressures into the constitution,'' he said.
Welsh Secretary John Redwood called for clarification of Labour's
proposals, which include assemblies for the English regions. ''Will
Scottish and Welsh MPs still be able to vote and discuss English issues?
Would North-east England's MPs be able to vote on southern English
issues?''
Labour Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said Labour proposed to
introduce democracy into the regional offices set up by the Government
to administer the English regions.
Social Security Minister Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish said Labour's
plans would mean the end of England. ''At one time, their ambition was
limited to giving Scotland and Wales the dubious pleasures of an
expensive devolved parliament and government, but no more,'' he said.
''England is to have the policy as well; but not as England. Oh no,
farewell England. Welcome 10, 12, or even 15 regional parliaments and
governments each, like Scotland, with its own premier.''
He said one Labour MP, Mr Doug Henderson, had suggested regional
assemblies in England with equivalent powers to the Scottish parliament.
''So all subjects devolved to the Scottish parliament will be devolved
to Wales, and to a network of regional parliaments and governments here
in England.''
Labour responded by pledging to take the fight to the Tories over
devolution. Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''We have
forced the Prime Minister to concede ground over a Scottish
parliament.''
In the Commons on Thursday, Mr Major accepted that his party had
offered a Scottish assembly in its 1974 General Election manifesto, but
said it had not included tax raising powers.
''By implication, John Major effectively conceded that the main issue
which divided Labour from the Tories on a Scottish parliament was not
the principle of having one in the first place but on whether or not it
would have tax-raising powers,'' Mr Robertson said.
For the SNP, Mr Alex Salmond said he had received answers to the
questions on Labour's devolution package he had put to Mr Robertson
nearly three months ago. Mr Salmond said they proved Mr Robertson had no
confidence in Labour's policies.
''In response to the straight question of where he would wish to
represent his constituents -- a Scottish assembly or a Westminster
parliament -- George Robertson refused to give an answer.
''How can anyone in Scotland have any confidence in Labour's
devolution scheme when Labour's Scottish spokesperson point-blank
refuses to give it his own personal vote of confidence?''
This weekend, the SNP will write to all Scottish Labour MPs to ask if
they will give up their seats in Westminster when a Scottish parliament
is created. The party plans to publish the answers.
Liberal Democrat spokesman Mr Menzies Campbell will today write to Mr
Major warning that his refusal to consider reform will lead to the
break-up of the UK.

THE financial director of Murray International has left the
Edinburgh-based group by ''mutual consent'' for personal reasons, the
group said yesterday.
Mr George Freeland, 43, of Edinburgh, who has held the post for almost
five years, is to pursue a management consultancy career with small to
medium-sized businesses.
He said: ''It was a very amicable separation based on a personal
decision on my part to enter into the market.''
Mr Freeland joined Murray International in July 1987 and worked in
operational divisions of the group, such as office equipment and
electronics, before moving to the group headquarters as financial
director in a corporate capacity in March 1990.

THE troubled scheme to build a restaurant and bar complex on the site
of a bandstand in Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow, took a decisive step
forward yesterday when the developers, who received a building warrant
for the work just hours before a licensing board hearing, also had their
drinks licence renewed.
The board decided to renew the provisional drinks licence, awarded to
Glasgow-based Bandstand Properties last year, after hearing of the
company's success in obtaining the warrant from the council's building
control department.
They were also told that construction of stage one of the project, a
pub, cafe, and restaurant, is now scheduled to begin in August.
Stage two, a covered bandstand arena with capacity for 1400, will
follow, the company said yesterday.
Within seconds of licensing board chairman Councillor James Coleman
confirming the move, a protester, Ms Jean Charsley, of Hillhead
Community Council, called for the decision to be postponed. Another
protester, Mr Andrew Wilson, had discovered the building warrant lacked
a signature, without which, they claimed, it was not valid.
Ms Charsley's challenge was ruled incompetent by the board chairman.
A council spokeswoman last night confirmed the building warrant had
not been signed, but said this was of no significance.
Mr Douglas Dagleish, solicitor for Bandstand Properties, said his
clients had obtained the necessary certificate of completion from the
district council's building control department.
Mr Ed Gillett, spokesman for the Kelvingrove Park Action Group, said
the campaigners would continue their efforts to defend the park against
what they saw as desecration.

GLASGOW Airport last night suffered its second blow in the space of
three days when another leading airline announced that it is withdrawing
direct weekday flights to a major European destination.
Lufthansa, the German airline, said it was axing its non-stop weekday
flights from Glasgow to Frankfurt from March 27. The mid-day flights to
Frankfurt, one of Europe's most important financial centres, would be
replaced with morning and evening feeder flights to Manchester where
passengers would be able to connect with five Lufthansa flights to
Germany and one to Austria.
However, in recognition of the expanding German and Scottish tourist
markets, the airline said it would continue to provide direct flights
between Glasgow and Frankfurt on both Saturdays and Sundays.
Lufthansa's move follows Air France's decision on Wednesday to drop
its daily service from Glasgow to Paris as part of a worldwide effort to
improve its faltering finances. Air France said it would continue to run
its flight from Paris to Edinburgh.
To soften the blow to Scottish businessmen, Lufthansa said the
connections through Manchester would improve on March 27, with weekly
flights to Munich being increased from six to 12 and Vienna services
rising from six to 11.
A Lufthansa spokesman said: ''Lufthansa is confident that the
increased frequency of services will be well accepted in the market
place. These changes form part of Lufthansa's strategic concept to build
up the transfer possibilities between Scotland and Germany.''
Scottish Airports, which runs Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen
airports last night said Lufthansa's decision was regrettable but did
not represent a severe blow to Glasgow Airport, which is undergoing a
#110m redevelopment.
Mr Sandy Ferrar, head of public affairs at Scottish Airports, said:
''It is disappointing, but we are delighted that a toe-hold is being
maintained on the route with a code-share with Business Air which means
that Lufthansa will still operate out of Glasgow at weekends.''
Echoing the comments of Mr Vernon Murphy, managing director of
Scottish Airports, who earlier this week advised businessmen to use
international air services out of Scotland or risk losing them, Mr
Ferrar said the move was directly linked to the failure of the business
community to use the Glasgow-Frankfurt route and make it financially
viable for Lufthansa.
''We did not invest #40m into the new international departure lounge
and pier -- the latest stage of the redevelopment programme -- on the
strength of one or two carriers being there or not being there,'' he
said.

SCOTTISH Tories who support constitutional change can expect to be
whipped into their party's new hard line Unionist stance as Ian Lang
warms to his role as the chief critic of devolution.
In a week when the constitutional question has shot to the top of the
Westminster agenda, the Scottish Secretary gave an interview to The
Herald which highlighted his complete conversion to the Unionist cause,
burying any suggestions that he has previously been open to the idea of
its reform.
He laid into the Labour and Liberal Democrat plans for a Scottish
parliament but also fired a clear warning to his own party members that
they would be expected to support the party onslaught against
devolution.
In dismissing Tory devolutionists as people who could be ''counted on
the fingers of one hand'', he made clear that the battleground in the
run up to the next General Election -- which he stressed would be fully
two years away -- would be one which permitted no neutrality on the
constitutional question.
One senior Scottish Conservative, Mr Struan Stevenson, has already
publicly recanted his long-standing support for a Scottish parliament at
a time when he has been selected for the safe seat of Dumfries, vacated
by Sir Hector Monro.
Mr Lang said of the remaining Tory devolutionists: ''You could count
them on the fingers of one hand. There are very few, very few indeed. I
believe the vast, overwhelming majority support the view that I take.''
He condemned Labour and Liberal Democrat proposals for a Scottish
parliament, saying: ''The devolution policy of the Labour Party is not a
coherent and credible alternative form of government for Scotland within
a unitary system. It is ersatz, it is bogus, and ultimately it is
unviable and, therefore, it is only one remove from separation.''
His attack will be reinforced tonight by a former Scottish Secretary.
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind will claim a federal structure for the
UK would be one of three options more logical than Labour's proposals
for devolution.
Mr Lang rejected as ''absolute baloney'' the claim that the Scottish
Constitutional Convention had produced a workable scheme. ''I am
convinced that the Labour Party's devolution case is bogus, that it
doesn't stand up to scrutiny,'' he said.
''The truth is that the debate has never been answered by them. They
have not answered the West Lothian question. They haven't addressed the
issue of why Scots should pay more in taxation than the rest of the
UK.''
He went on: ''The plain fact is they haven't the faintest idea what
they are contemplating for England. They committed themselves to setting
up regional assemblies where people want them.
''They have no idea what their powers will be, what the membership
will be, what the boundaries will be.''
Rejecting the aspirations of Scots for better governance, he said:
''It's like asking people if they are in favour of sunshine and apple
pie. You tend to get the answer yes.''
On Labour's recent performance under Mr Tony Blair, he accused the new
leader of leaving his party rootless. ''You can't just get away with
empty phrase-making and wish lists.''
He went on: ''He is offering no alternative to Clause 4. What he is
doing, though, is applying an ad man's philosphy to a political faith
which has motivated his party since it birth. That ad man's philosophy
has no roots and no credibility.''

SCOTLAND'S other national drink company admitted yesterday that jobs
will be lost following an announcement it is to centralise its three
Scottish factories.
A G Barr, the maker of Irn Bru, is set to move its three production
units in Glasgow, Wishaw, and Falkirk to a site at Westfield in
Cumbernauld.
Just days ago the company, which has an annual #87.94m turnover,
announced it had increased its annual pre-tax profits by a record 63%.
It has also recently taken over the Orangina franchise for the UK.
Sales and distribution will continue at the three sites, with the head
office remaining in Glasgow. Other production facilities -- at Atherton
and Mansfield -- will be unaffected.
The company, which has a workforce of 1161, said yesterday none of the
three sites can provide the size of area needed to ''ensure we can both
increase our capacity while achieving the highest levels of quality and
efficiency''.
A spokeswoman said it was impossible to say how many redundancies
there would be as a result of the move. Employees were being briefed
about the situation.
''We naturally hope that a high proportion of the staff who are
ultimately required at Cumbernauld will be transferred from within our
existing employees in our current production locations,'' she said.
The company expects to obtain a property of 107,000sqft which will be
upgraded and ready for the installation of three high speed production
lines by September 1995.
Labour MP Mr David Marshall, whose Shettleston constituency takes in
Barr's site at Parkhead, Glasgow, said last night he was shocked by the
news and would be writing to the company chairman to obtain further
details.
A spokesman for Glasgow Development Agency said last night: ''It is
obviously disappointing for Glasgow when a long-standing company such as
A G Barr decides to move its manufacturing facility out of the city.''
