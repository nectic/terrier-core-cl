EUROPEAN CUP-WINNERS CUP
JOE Royle has called on Everton fans to make Goodison Park an
intimidating arena for today's European Cup-winners' Cup opponents, KR
Reykjavik.
Everton lead 3-2 from the first-leg in Iceland and have slashed prices
in the hope of confronting their part-time opponents with a wall of
Mersey sound, generated by a near-capacity crowd.
''We need to make Goodison a hostile place,'' said the manager.
''Reykjavik are used to playing in front of crowds of one or two
thousand but it will be different this time.
''We need to unsettle them as soon as possible and the fans can play
their part. They have waited for us to get going first this season. Last
year the crowd made their presence felt from the first minute and we
need them to do that now.''
Royle's appeal indicates that he is not taking Everton's passage to
the second round for granted against the schoolteachers, computer
technicians and students of Rekjavik, who have already qualified for
Europe next year by winning their domestic cup competition again.
After three successive Premiership defeats, a goalless Coca-Cola Cup
scrap at Millwall and a scare in Iceland, Royle's caution is
understandable -- especially as he will be without captain Dave Watson,
who has a stomach muscle strain.
Dave Unsworth, a first-leg penalty scorer, will return after being
dropped and then suspended as Everton defend an unbeaten 10-match record
in the competition.
Meanwhile, holders Real Zaragoza and fellow Spanish side Deportivo
Coruna both have significant injury absentees for their first round,
second leg home matches.
Zaragoza striker Fernando Morientes, who scored in the 2-0 first leg
victory against Inter Bratislava two weeks ago, is having treatment in
the Netherlands for an injury to his left leg.
Deportivo Coruna will be without Brazilian midfield international
Mauro Silva when they take on Apoel of Nicosia after a scoreless draw in
the first leg.
In Italy, Parma coach Nevio Scala will rest Bulgarian striker Hristo
Stoichkov and Gianfranco Zola against FC Teuta Durresi of Albania,
according to the Gazzetta dello Sport daily newspaper. Parma lead 2-0 on
Zola's two first-leg goals.
AEK Athens' Serb coach Dusan Bayevic said his side would be at full
strength but would take nothing for granted against Sion of Switzerland
despite a 2-0 first leg win.
Israel's Maccabi Haifa will make several changes after their 4-0 first
leg defeat by Portugal's Sporting Lisbon.
Uruguayan international Edgardo Aldinofi is likely to play in midfield
while first-string defender Moshe Glam is set to win back his place in
an effort to contain dangerman Pedro Barbosa, who netted a hat trick
when the sides met in Lisbon.
Feyenoord Rotterdam of Holland, comfortable 7-0 first-leg away winners
over Dag Liepaja of Latvia, will save several key players for the league
match against PSV Eindhoven on Sunday.
Borussia Moenchengladbach travel to Macedonia with a 3-0 cushion over
Sileks Kratovo.

STAKIS Glasgow City is the newest hotel in town and when it is opened
officially on Tuesday by Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish
Enterprise, it will be the Stakis organisation's third fully operational
establishment in the city centre.
Conveniently situated at the Cambridge Street end of Hill Street, a
minute away from the Sauchiehall Street shopping precinct, it is a
quality three-star hotel with a continental touch, catering for the
price-conscious business and leisure market.
For Stakis plc, 1995 has been a growth year on the hotel front in
Scotland. In February the 74-bedroom four-star Stakis East Kilbride,
with one of the largest hotel leisure centres north of the Border, was
acquired from its former owners for #4.7m.
At the end of May the #7.2m 134-bedroom Stakis Edinburgh Airport hotel
commenced trading and was officially opened by Her Royal Highness the
Princess Royal on July 17. The next day, July 18, the #4.2m Stakis
Glasgow City hotel opened its doors in Garnethill and has gone from
strength to strength from that moment on.
Designed by Stewart Watt Limited, the Glasgow-based property
development company, the Stakis Glasgow City takes into account the rich
artistic heritage of the area with Glasgow School of Art further up the
hill and the famous Willow Tearooms of Charles Rennie Mackintosh just
around the corner.
The open-plan ground floor encompasses the comfortable public lounge
with sumptuous settees, the aptly-named Gallery Bar and the 70-seater
Gallery Bistro. The ivory-painted walls are hung with stylish prints and
pictures. The hotel's three meeting and function rooms -- the ground
floor Cadell and the first-floor Hunter and Peploe -- celebrate the
Scottish colourists.
There are 93 bedrooms on seven floors, including 12 family rooms and
two rooms adapted for the disabled. The hotel is wheelchair-friendly
with ease of access from outside. One third of all rooms are designated
non-smoking and there are braille push buttons in the hi-tech, stainless
steel lifts.
All rooms are light and airy with secure door entry. They contain en
suite bathrooms, direct dial telephones and terrestrial and satellite
colour TV. An added attraction is a free copy of The Herald for every
guest.
The tariff for a city centre hotel of the Stakis Glasgow City's
quality is reasonable, offering special value-for-money to families, as
children up to the age of 15 stay free. Family rooms are ideal for two
adults and two children. Corporate single rooms are #49.50, doubles
#59.50, and a hearty Scottish breakfast is an additional #4.95. Weekend
rates start from #30 per person including breakfast.
There is a laundry and dry cleaning service, express check-out can be
arranged and there is a secure public car park adjacent to the hotel.
Ciosa Dallas has been general manager of the Stakis Glasgow City since
January, the first woman to be appointed to this senior post by the
company in Scotland. Before joining Stakis Hotels she worked in a
prestigious country house hotel on the outskirts of Edinburgh which led
to her appointment as front office manager of the Stakis Dunblane hotel
for two years.
Corporate business is a very important aspect of the weekly programme
at the Stakis Glasgow City. Like most Stakis hotels it offers Assured
Meetings, a package that guarantees purpose-designed, air-conditioned
meeting rooms and training facilities, incorporating the latest
audio-visual equipment, natural daylight plus secretarial support.
Break-out rooms are available and the daily delegate rate of #27.50 and
the 24-hour delegate rates of #76.50 single and #56.50 sharing a twin
are highly competitive.
The ground floor Cadell Room can accommodate 35 theatre-style and 20
boardroom-style. The first-floor Hunter and Peploe Rooms can each
accommodate 24 theatre-style and 16 boardroom-style. All rooms have the
flexibility to cater for private functions or dinner parties, with
special menus prepared on request by head chef Greg Ward.
In the Gallery Bistro lunch is served from 12.30pm until 2pm, and
dinner from 6.30pm until 9.30pm. The Gallery Bar's blackboard menu has a
selection of baguettes and baked potatoes with a variety of fillings.
The wide and varied menu, with vegetarian choices, as well as offering
traditional Scottish dishes includes cuisine from around the world, all
at reasonable prices.
Since opening in July, the Stakis Glasgow City hotel has already
established itself as a part of the city's hotel skyline, with a relaxed
and comfortable atmosphere which has proved popular with business and
leisure travellers.

On the day that the Scottish Church Census is published, Steve Bruce
examines the implications for the country, clergy, and congregations as
the tide of mainstream Christianity continues to ebb
ONLY in the modern world can we divide the Godly and the unGodly and
count them. In the Middle Ages religion was not particularly a matter
for the individual. Scotland was then a Christian society rather than a
society of Christians. The Church, supported by the monarch, glorified
God on behalf of the people. In so far as anyone cared what ordinary
people thought, they were expected to attend church for the important
festivals, to accept the Church's moral and social discipline, and to
allow the Church to sanctify such important community events as births,
deaths, and weddings.
A vague Christianity was universal. Everyone understood that there was
a God who made the earth and who would judge them and that the Church
controlled the means to appease God. Most people knew the basic prayers
and most had frequent recourse to the supernatural for help in this
life. Holy water was sprinkled on cattle and on fields to help them
prosper. Marital problems were solved with a donation to this saint;
health problems with a pilgrimage to that shrine.
The Reformation in the sixteenth century was far more than a change in
religious ideas. The Reformers fundamentally altered the nature of the
individual. By insisting that the religious virtues of the pious could
make no difference to the souls of the awful, Martin Luther made each
person solely responsible for his and her fate; sponsoring monks to be
religious on your behalf was no longer an option.
At the same time, the individual acquired a new right: the right to
discern God's will and to face God without the mediation of the clergy.
It took centuries for the full implications of this new individualism to
be worked out but a genie had been released and it could not be stuffed
back into the bottle. Once people got in the habit of defying their
religious masters, they asserted and gained the right to other sorts of
freedom.
An immediate consequence was the fragmentation of Christendom. The one
Church became a series of national churches and within each state
competing sects proliferated. The first response of the state church was
always to coerce the dissenters -- Red Coats and penal laws -- but this
did little to dissuade the nonconformists and the magistrates gradually
lost the taste for trying to enforce religious orthodoxy. The penal laws
were ignored and dissent flourished.
So long as there was one national church, its privileges were
uncontentious but with three and four and five organisations all
claiming to be the one true church, it became politically difficult to
justify a system which allowed one of those organisations to fund itself
by taxes, to organise and staff the national school system, or to be
responsible for social welfare and moral discipline.
In an increasingly democratic and individualist society, which in
theory accords equal weight to the preferences of every individual,
counting those preferences becomes important and the results of such
counting figure high in debates about public policy. By the middle of
the nineteenth century, arguments about privileges of the state churches
and about religious freedom were raising questions about just how many
people adhered to the national churches.
The result was the first and only state-sponsored survey of religion
in Britain (which unlike Northern Ireland, does not have a religion
question in its regular decennial census). The 1851 Census of Religious
Worship was a majestic work. Questionnaires were sent to the clergy of
all known congregations asking for the numbers of those who attended
each service held on March 30. Returns were had from over 85% of known
places of worship.
When the figures were published, they severely dented the prestige of
the Church of England by showing that half of the country's Christians
worshipped outwith the state church. Figures for Scotland were greeted
more calmly. The departure from the Kirk of the evangelicals who formed
the Free Church just eight years earlier had already told Scots that
their national church no longer spoke for the bulk of the people.
Although it was waning rapidly, the power of the Church of England was
such that the Government never again repeated the church census.
Periodically there were small-scale local surveys of attendance but it
was not until the late 1970s, when a private organisation, MARC Europe
(which later became Christian Research) shouldered the mammoth task,
that national surveys were again undertaken.

BRITAIN'S challenge for the Sunday's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe swelled
to five after Strategic Choice impressed in a gallop yesterday.
The Irish St Leger winner pleased trainer Paul Cole sufficiently to
earn his place alongside Lammtarra, Balanchine, Pure Grain, and Luso in
the Longchamp spectacular.
Owned by Martyn Arbib, Strategic Choice will run in the same colours
as Snurge who twice contested the Arc, finishing third behind Saumarez
in 1990.
''He worked very well,'' said the trainer. I didn't ask him to do very
much but he appeared to be in good form.''
The four-year-old has top-class form, having finished third behind
Lammtarra in the King George but he then flopped in soft ground at
Baden-Baden, conditions he looks set to encounter in Paris.
''It's not going to be easy, said the trainer. ''The English always
over-rate their chances. We are up against a lot of soft-ground
specialists, especially Carnegie.''
Pat Eddery was switched to Irish Derby winner Winged Love yesterday as
his original mount, Valley Of Gold, was withdrawn in favour of the
Rothmans International. But if rain persists in France there is a
prospect that the ex-champion, who has won the Arc four times, may have
to sit out the big race.
Anthony Stroud, owner Sheikh Mohammed's racing manager said: ''Winged
Love does not want it heavy and there is every chance that Eddery could
be watching the race from the stands.''

TWICE they fell behind, and twice Rangers fought their way back into
contention in an enthralling Champions' League tie at Ibrox last night,
but, despite their resilience and the strength of their desire, a share
of the spoils might not prove enough when it comes to the final
reckoning.
Rangers needed to win their first Group C match on home turf after
having lost in Bucharest a couple of weeks ago, but at least Walter
Smith's side managed to restore much of their pride which had taken a
battering in recent weeks and their first point might well inspire them
to even greater work before they take their leave of this tournament.
Juventus, who beat Borussia Dortmund two weeks ago, again won
comfortably last night against Steaua Bucharest, and are confirming
their status as favourites to win Group C with consumate ease while the
German champions, who were not as good as the pre-match publicity,
nevertheless might just have emerged as second favourites to qualify for
the quarter-final stages although they were pushed hard at Ibrox.
Rangers must now take at least a draw in Dortmund as well as beat
Steau at Ibrox to have any possibility of reaching the quarter-finals
and, even then, they must hope Steaua and Dortmund damage one another.
After having taken an early lead through Heiko Herrlich, Dortmund may
have reckoned their work was over for the evening, especially since
Rangers had an unfamiliar look.
Injury and suspension denied Smith the use of David Robertson and Alan
McLaren respectively and the manager had to come up with a peculiar
defence.
Stephen Wright was deployed in the middle of the back line along with
Richard Gough and Gordan Petric and Alex Cleland, purchased last year as
a squad player, found himself starting at left full back.
On the opposite side, Gordon Durie was required to shuttle up and down
between right back and the right wing.
Brian Laudrup partnered Ally McCoist up front, but the Dane was rarely
seen and did not reappear after the interval -- he damaged an ankle --
with his place being taken by Ian Ferguson, who made a vital
contribution, scoring Rangers' second equaliser which gave his side's
fans, who made up the vast majority of the 33,209 crowd, renewed
anticipation.
However, despite a determined and entertaining second half, the Ibrox
side had to settle for the draw and will awake this morning to the
realisation that they will have to do even better from here on in. Yet,
in the misery of knowing this makeshift side's best was not enough,
there were heartening signs.
Paul Gascoigne played his best game for Rangers to date and Charlie
Miller, who took it upon himself in the first half to maintain a
midfield challenge, will emerge from such company better and stronger.
This is the Gascoigne who can excite and thrill and from whom younger
players can learn.
Also, Gough again demonstrated that he is by far the best defender in
the premier division, although it is unlikely the Scotland manager,
Craig Brown, who watched the match will respond by inviting the Rangers
captain to rejoin the national squad.
Gough, in fact, dragged his side back into contention with a splendid
header after 62 minutes from a Gascoigne free-kick on the left and the
goalscorer continued to inspire those around him to greater efforts.
Gough surged forward with purpose at every opportunity and he had
Dortmund's manager Ottmar Hitzfeld out of the dug-out roaring at his
players, who found it impossible to subdue Rangers.
They still lacked subtlety and the Germans were more comfortable on
the ball, but they can use this performance as a platform on which to
build and face the remainder of their group games with greater optimism
than had been evident after the match against Steaua. One wonders what
might have happened had they attacked Borussia from the beginning, but
at least Smith knows his side are moving in the right direction.
That did not seem to be the case in 18 minutes when Herrlich was able
to rise to a delivery from the right by Stefan Reuter, who was allowed
free passage by Cleland. Herrlich, too, was given space by Wright and
the German was able to select his spot -- Andy Goram's right-hand corner
-- and put his team ahead.
When Rangers went in at the break they didn't leave behind much hope
for their supporters, but, with Ferguson on and Gough and Gascoigne
resolved to turn the tide, they pushed the Germans back.
Gough's goal suggested a home win was possible, but the elation which
had brought Ibrox to colourful life subsided six minutes later when
Martin Kree, who had stolen forward from the back, was allowed to dart
among Rangers' defenders and head in an Andreas Moller corner from the
right.
Again the Ibrox side had given away a soft goal, but the inspiration
being provided by Gough, who had been a doubtful starter because of a
leg injury, remained a powerful force and Rangers would not be pushed
back and they equalised again.
Stuart McCall's corner went to Gascoigne, his shot was deflected back
out, and Ferguson's looping header drifted over defenders and into the
net after 72 minutes.
Before the end McCall's fierce drive had to be punched away by
Borussia keeper Stefan Klos and a match which was in German control in
the first half almost ran away from them completely.
It might well have done had shots by Miller and Cleland on either side
of the break not found the bar and a post.
Rangers introduced Ian Durrant for Durie, who had beenbooked.
RANGERS -- Goram, McCall, Gough, Wright, Petric, Cleland, Miller,
Gascoigne, Laudrup, McCoist, Durie. Substitutes -- Durrant, Ferguson,
Murray, Brown, Thomson.
BORUSSIA DORTMUND -- Klos, Kohler, Kree, Freund, Cesar, Sammer,
Reuter, Zorc, Ricken, Moller, Herrlich. Substitutes -- De Beer, Schmidt,
Berger, Tretschok, Sosa.
Referee -- J Uilenberg (Holland).

RANGERS' captain courageous Richard Gough told the Ibrox support last
night: ''We can still qualify from this Champions' League section.''
Gough spoke after the dramatic draw with German champions, Borussia
Dortmund, at Ibrox.
And Gough, who had passed a fitness test in the morning, declared:
''If we play with the spirit we showed tonight, then there is no reason
why we cannot qualify.
''There will be a battle for the second place -- Juventus are well
ahead already and they were always favourites to be first. Between
ourselves, Borussia, and the Romanians, there will be a dog-fight.
''Borussia played an open game tonight, they will play the same way in
Germany. So shall we. We have no reason to fear them.
''I believe that we can give Juventus problems in Italy and certainly
give them the same here here at Ibrox. It is not inconceivable that we
can qualify when you see the current situation. Remember that there are
three points for a victory.''
Gough had only one disappointment from last night. He pointed out:
''We should not have lost that second goal. We had defenders there, and
it should have been cleared. At 1-1, we were the only team who were
going to win and then we lost a very bad goal. It was shocking.''
The Germans put a brave face on things, but behind the scenes they
remain worried by the tenacity of the Scottish champions.
While their coach, Ottmar Hitzfeldt, claimed: ''We should have won''
-- others in the Borussia camp were concerned that their team lost their
way against the Scots.
Said Hitzfeldt: ''I thought that we did enough to win the game,
especially the way we played in the first half. When Julio Cesar went
off injured after half-time we had problems. We slept a little and this
allowed Rangers to come back. This was still a better result for us than
for the Scots.''
There was a contrasting view from Ibrox manager Walter Smith who said:
''I was disappointed that we did not win the game. We had enough chances
to do so and we lost two bad goals.
''I think all the games in this Champions' League section are going to
be very close. People may want to write us off -- but that is not the
way it is. We can still qualify.
''I thought that Richard Gough was superb. He passed the fitness test
in the morning and then went out and showed the kind of ability that we
know he possesses.
''As for Paul Gascoigne, I thought this was the best game he has
played for us.

JUVENTUS, with Alessandro del Piero in magnificent form, made it two
wins in two Champions' League games with an emphatic 3-0 victory over
Steaua Bucharest in Turin last night.
Angelo di Livio, del Piero, and Fabrizio Ranvanelli scored in a
14-minute spell either side of the interval to put the 1985 European
champions clear at the top of Group C.
Del Piero, who scored in the 3-1 win against Borussia Dortmund in
Germany two weeks ago, made the first goal after 35 minutes when his
cross on a counter-attack set up the strike by midfielder di Livio.
Four minutes later del Piero cut to his right from the far corner of
the penalty area before curling the ball over the outstretched fingers
of Romanian World Cup goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea.
An over-anxious Ravanelli squandered a chance after 37 minutes when he
fired wide from three yards with only Stelea to beat. But he made up for
it four minutes into the second half when he headed home an acute-angled
cross from Gianluca Vialli.
Vialli himself shot wide from close range in the dying minutes.
The match had been evenly balanced until di Livio broke the deadlock
when he met del Piero's cross at the far post.
Steaua striker Ion Vladoiu had a chance after 15 minutes but sent a
Iulian Filipescu cross wide.
That turned out to be the best chance for Steaua, who succeeded
Juventus as European champions in 1986 when they became the first club
from the former Soviet bloc to win the trophy.
Portuguese internationalist Paulo Sousa directed a fast,
well-organised Juventus midfield but Vialli and Ravanelli passed up
several gilt-edged opportunities.
Three Juventus players and one from Steaua were booked.

* WORLD motor racing champion Michael Schumacher escaped unhurt
yesterday when his private car ran into the back a lorry on the motorway
near his home outside Cologne. He parted on good terms with the truck
driver after giving him his autograph.
Schumacher said he had been fiddling with his radio and failed to
notice that the truck had come to a halt in heavy traffic. Schumacher,
who appears in television advertisements for advanced motoring courses
including skid techniques, tried to swerve around the lorry on the hard
shoulder but still clipped it, crumpling the left wing of his car.

ROY Aitken will today make Paul Bernard his first major signing for
Aberdeen. The manager was locked in talks last night with the player
after having agreed an #800,000 fee with Oldham.
Club secretary Terry Cale said: ''We have accepted Aberdeen's offer
and Bernard is now up there discussing personal terms.''
The former Scotland under-21 star, who has been signing weekly
contracts at Boundary Park in readiness for a move, will not be
difficult to deal with.
Before heading north, the midfielder admitted: ''I have been waiting
for this call for weeks after hearing of Aberdeen's interest. I need a
move to a bigger club to satisfy my ambitions, and Aberdeen certainly
comes into this category.
''I know Tommy Craig's methods from Scotland's under 21s, and I am
looking forward to working with him again.''
Aitken, who would only confirm the bid for Bernard, has not been slow
to use the cash generated by the Pittodrie club's share launch to
strengthen his side.
With #1.5m still in the kitty, the Dons boss will bring in new players
in the coming weeks to build a side capable of bringing sucess back to
Pittodrie.

SCOTLAND have been forced to make a number of late changes for their
matches against Ireland in the shinty/hurling internationals at Fort
William this weekend.
In the senior squad, Allan MacKechnie of Glenorchy replaces the
injured Gordon MacIntyre (Oban Camanachd) and Allan MacInnes (Glasgow
Mid Argyll) has been called in to replace Oban Camanachd's Dave McCuish.
In the under-21 squad, Fraser Inglis, recovering from an appendicitis
operation, has been replaced by James MacDonald of Tayforth, a former
Caberfeidh player.
The Scots, as ever, face a huge challenge, with the under-21 squad in
particular facing a daunting task. Of the Irish under-21 players, Frank
Lohan and Stephen MacNamara played in the All-Ireland final.
In the senior squad, several players are already well known to the
Scots, none more so than Brian Corcoran, the hugely talented young star
who won the medal as man of the match in the under-21 match in Galway
last year.
The under-21 match is due to start at 2pm, with the senior game
following at 3.45pm.

JOHN Ngugi, the former Olympic 5000 metres gold medallist and
five-times world cross-country champion, will require a substantial
confidence injection if he is to keep a race date in Edinburgh on Sunday
-- his first contest in more than three years.
Kenyan Ngugi, who maintains he never used drugs, but declined a dope
test, was reinstated in May under ''exceptional circumstances'' after he
had served 27 months of a four-year ban. He is due to race in the
10,000m BUPA Great Caledonian Run this weekend, but has been intimidated
by interest generated by his comeback.
Reporters at his home in Nyahruru, where he runs a wholesale store,
were told yesterday: ''I am not ready now . . . the aim is December,
then the world cross-country championships, then prospects for an
Atlanta gold.''
He said he was troubled by a knee injury, and that if he went to
Edinburgh at all, it would only be to sign autographs.
But his agent, John Bicourt, insisted last night that Ngugi had
already made the four-hour trip from his home, at 8000ft, near Thompson
Falls, to Nairobi, en route for Britain, and would arrive today.

LIKE every other manager, Jimmy Nicholl has his dreams but, perhaps
unlike most, the Raith Rovers leader does not indulge in fantasies too
often. His visions are simple, worthy, and attainable, like the picture
he has in his mind's eye about Rovers' next venture in the UEFA Cup.
''I can see them getting off the plane in a big city, going to a great
stadium to play against a big European team, floodlights blazing, dew on
the grass, and thousands of our own supporters watching. That is what I
want for these players,'' said Nicholl.
''It is a picture which has every prospect of coming into real focus,
because the odds are good that Rovers, after their narrow success over
Akranes, will come up against one of the more renowned Contintental
clubs when the draw is made in Geneva tomorrow.
Nicholl, as ever, will prime his team for whatever exercise befalls
them, but his rationale in wanting a major name is understandable. ''We
have got past a team from the Faroes and one from Iceland, and I know
people will shrug their shoulders and say: 'So what?' But if we had gone
out against one of them, it would have been a terrible disappointment.
''If we are to go out of this tournament, then I want it to be against
a big side. There are 31 other teams left, with about seven of them
weaker teams that I would rather not meet. It is time for our lads to
get the chance against some glamorous side.
Nicholl also is very keen to let Raith players enjoy a little taste of
the kind of major stage excitement that he experienced so often with
Manchester United, Rangers, and Northern Ireland. ''Remember, some of
these lads were earning #50 a week as part-timers here five years ago.
Some people will say I am being defeatist talking about going out, but
surely reaching the last 32 shows that we will think about getting into
the last 16.'' The financial lift that would result in a big draw may
not be far away from the manager's thoughts, either. Certainly, chairman
Alex Penman knows what a major attraction could mean, especially as he
ponders the prospect of redeveloping Stark's Park next year. The plans
are that north and south stands will be built, beginning in March, and
eventually finishing with an 11,600 capacity stadium.
His own preference would be a German team and a full house at Easter
Road, one of two likely alternatives to Stark's Park if a big crowd is
expected. The other is Murrayfield, and if that were to be the venue, it
would be a historic day for Rovers and Scottish football. No Scottish
soccer team, as the rugby folks would put it, has ever played in that
impressive stadium.
* PETER Schmeichel yesterday reflected on the magic moment that so
nearly wrote a glorious page in the Manchester United history books and
claimed: ''It wasn't really a risk -- and I'll do it again if I have
to.''
The Danish keeper lent his 6ft 4in frame to the United cause to
amazing effect as he headed home a Ryan Giggs corner to level the UEFA
Cup first-round tie with Rotor Volgograd.
Schmeichel's astonishing seven minutes as a green-shirted striker was
not quite enough to complete what would have been one of the greatest
ever European comebacks, and United went out on the away goals rule.
Said the keeper: ''We had to score two goals in the last seven minutes
so the decision was made for me,'' said Schmeichel. ''I couldn't lose
anything because it didn't really matter if we lost 3-1, 4-1 or 5-1, and
there were two defenders back to cover for me.''

<HEADLINE>Burns warns his men not to be caught at the back. Celtic manager puts case for the defence</HEADLINE>

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns was genuinely excited yesterday at the
prospect of European glory nights returning to Parkhead -- even though
he agreed that the high expectations of the fans will be one of the
major dangers in tonight's European Cup-winners' Cup first-round,
second-leg match.
The Scottish Cup holders won the first leg against Dinamo Batumi in
Georgia and the 3-2 scoreline two weeks ago suggests that victory will
belong to Burns and his men again tonight at the new-look Celtic Park.
However, the Celtic manager tempers his anticipation of a European
comeback in front of the club's own support with a degree of caution.
Manchester United's defeat was mentioned as well as the other away
victories scattered across the Continent in UEFA Cup games on Tuesday
night.
These results caused Burns to stress yesterday: ''We cannot go
charging forward without any thoughts of defence. The worry for us is
that we can be our own worst enemies. The players could get carried away
by the support and the atmosphere they will create and forget about a
proper defensive set-up.
''That is something we will have to guard against. It is, after all,
only common sense, because while we have done the most difficult part of
the job the tie is not over.''
Yesterday, as the players got down to their final preparations at
Seamill, Burns was still unable to finalise a team because of the
injuries to his three major signings.
He admitted that he would not have all three players for the game and
had accepted that. So, while Dutchman Pierre van Hooydonk may yet make
it, the German, Andreas Thom, and midfield player Phil O'Donnell could
be sidelined.
Burns maintained, however, that Saturday's premier division game with
Rangers would not affect any decisions he would make before tonight's
match.
''The priority is to be in the draw for the second round of this
tournament when it is made on Friday,'' he said. ''We are only at
half-time in the game and we have to make certain of going through.
''There have been many great European nights here and we want to have
more. I enjoyed many as a player and, now, as a manager I would like to
see these players enjoy some.
''Two weeks ago I went into Europe with them for the first time and I
was impressed by the way they went about their work. There were real
difficulties surrounding the game but the players ignored the off-field
problems and simply got on with the job. I could not have asked any more
from them.''
Celtic went into that game with injuries, just as they will tonight.
But they could have van Hooydonk back and they will have skipper Paul
McStay, who has an added edge to his game following ankle operations, in
midfield.
Burns believes that the enforced lay-off at the beginning of the
season has given his captain a new urgency. ''There are times when a
break can help a player and allow him to return with his batteries
recharged. That is what has happened with Paul. Now, he is raring to go,
and that is a bonus for the club.
''He has been in the engine-room of this team for a long time and it
says a lot that he can still show an appetite for the game.''
The other Scotland midfield player, John Collins, is listed in the
20-strong squad Burns took to Seamill. He is, says the manager, ''a
genuine contender'' to play in the game even though suggestions that his
Parkhead career will soon be over grow more persistent by the day.
Burns also mixes several young players along with his established
first-team men and the manner in which some of them performed in the 4-0
victory over Hearts at Tynecastle will not have harmed their cause.
Brian McLaughlin and Simon Donnelly look sure to play tonight. So,
too, will Peter Grant, who will be suspended for the Rangers match, and
his experience will be vital as Celtic attempt to add to their lead
without giving the Georgians any chance of wresting the initiative away
from them.
Even with their injury problems, the Celtic squad seems too strong for
Batumi and with the proper, professional approach advocated by Burns I
believe Celtic will win again to confirm their superiority.
Meanwhile, Burns confirmed that Dutch right-back Gerry de Jong is on
trial at Celtic Park. The 30-year-old has won eight caps for Holland and
spent most of his career with PSV Eindhoven until moving to Cannes for a
spell in the French first division. He bought his release from Cannes
and is now a free agent. Celtic squad:
Marshall, Bonner, Kerr, Vata, Hughes, Boyd, McKinlay, Donnelly, Grant,
McStay, McLaughlin, Walker, Hay, Falconer, Gray, Mackay, Thom, van
Hooydonk, O'Donnell, Collins.

Livingston 1, Stirling Albion 1
(After extra time)
(Stirling won 4-2 on penalties)
STIRLING Albion advanced into the semi-final stage of the Challenge
Cup after a penalty shoot-out at Meadowbank last night.
After the scores had finished 1-1 after extra time, Stirling booked a
semi-final slot against Stenhousemuir by scoring with all four of their
penalty kicks.
The home side had a poor start in the shoot-out, with Jason Young and
Grant McMartin missing the first two kicks, and Stirling powered through
with successful kicks from Tommy Tait, Willie Watters, Paul Roberts, and
Colin Mitchell.
Stirling dominated normal time. Horace Stout produced a couple of fine
saves to deny Stirling during the time -- from Andy Paterson and
substitute Watters.
Livingston took the lead in extra time when Gordon McLeod fired home
at the second attempt. Then Stirling equalised after 114 minutes through
Joe McLeod.
LIVINGSTON -- Stoute, Williamson, Duthie, Davidson, Graham, Smart,
Alleyne, Harvey, Callaghan, McLeod, McMartin. Substitutes -- Sorbie,
Young, Bailey.
STIRLING ALBION -- Monaghan, Paterson, Gibson, Mitchell, McQuilter,
Tait, McInnes, Deas, McCormick, Taggart, McLeod. Substitutes -- Watson,
Watters, Roberts.
Referee -- G Clyde (Bearsden).

SO, it would appear that Glasgow is, after all, miles better. The
three Craig boys -- Mark, Richie, and James -- are to leave Hawick and
return to West of Scotland.
It was an amazing story in the first place as the ambitious sons of
former Celtic footballer Jim Craig left West in a cloud of dust for the
Borders in the hope, and belief, that the knowledge they would get there
would outstrip anything that they were taught in Glasgow. The Hawick
tradition, and the pull of Jim Renwick as backs coach, did the trick.
Now, Hawick sit bottom of the league.
Mark Craig, the eldest and, therefore, the elected representative of
the three, told the Hawick committee last night that the brothers were
to depart.
''It didn't work out. It just hasn't been what we expected,'' said
Mark. ''We are not enjoying it and the rugby side hasn't worked out
either. We have to admit that it was a mistake on our part.''
Mark, who appeared to have fallen out with the West of Scotland club
with his comments earlier this year, phoned Sandy Service, the club's
coach, to ask if the three 'Lisbon Cubs' could return.
''We have been very lucky that there was no bitterness on Sandy's
part,'' said Mark. ''I have to admit that I expected him to have some
bad blood about it, but there wasn't, and he said we could come back.''
Service, a man who has seen a thing or two in his life, seems happy to
have his prodigals return: ''I am delighted to have the three lads back
at the club,'' he said. ''I understand that they will be training at
Burnbrae on Tuesday, and I know that they are ambitious individuals. But
I must say that they will need to battle hard to get into the team, and
this adds to our strength in depth.''
The decision to exit Hawick stage left doesn't appear to have been a
spur of the moment thing, and we can only feel sorry for what are
effectively three city boys thrust into the small community of a Border
town. They have found it hard, and none of the three have been regulars
in the Hawick side.
''I have to admit that it has got to the three of us down here in
Hawick,'' said Mark. ''The people have been great, but it's a small
place and it's not for us. It has been playing on our minds. I have been
playing in the Hawick Trades 2nds to make things worse. We just have to
learn from this, and get on with it at West. We have been lucky that
Sandy has been so understanding.''
What a story this has been. Richie is to quit his job at a hotel,
James is hoping to get a transfer from college, Mark, in sales, is happy
to be based in Glasgow.
They have been sharing a flat in Hawick. This Saturday, father Jim
will bring a big van down to load up their possessions, they will watch
West play Kelso at Poynder Park, and then it's up the road to home. Good
to have you back boys.
OUR spies tell us that Cecil du Plessis, the South African fraud squad
detective who is now back playing his rugby on South Africa's eastern
seaboard after having been the subject of a report to the procurator
fiscal in connection withan alleged drink-driving offence in the sunny
east-end of Glasgow, was never entirely happy with his lot at the
neglected wastelands of GHK.
He complained about his accommodation. ''I am not happy about the
flat,'' said Cecil in a typically frivolous South African sort of way.
''Well,'' replied his nameless confidant at the bar. ''You've got a
door, haven't you?''
''Yes,'' replied Cecil.
''And you can walk out of it into the fresh air any time you want?''
asked our long-standing GHK member.
''Agreed,'' said du Plessis.
''Think,'' continued the GHK oldie. ''That was more than Nelson
Mandela ever had.''
Ah, the lasting benefit of political sensitivity is all around us,
especially at Old Anniesland. We will be interested to see whether GHK
fork out some more money for his air fare back. Although, obviously, my
friends, they would never do that as they are not allowed to pay for his
flights. Imagine suggesting that in the first place.
STICKING with commercially aware GHK in this modern rugby world that
is obsessed with money, not only do they have Harper McLeod to guide
them legally, but they have Andy Little as director of rugby to make
sure that the players all look smart and attractive on match days.
On his insistence, the boys have to wear GHK ties for special
occasions, no matter whether it is stuffing Stew-Mel or going down
embarrassingly to West of Scotland.
Recently, he lined his team up for an inspection, whereupon his eyes
rested on one Alan Watt, who was, quite obviously, not dressed for the
occasion. He handed Watt a tie.
''You owe me #7.50,'' said Little. ''Thanks,'' replied Watt. ''Just
take it out my trust fund.''
AYR rugby club, those famous chaps from Millbrae who have the dubious
honour in world rugby of declining the services of New Zealand world
beater Josh Kronfeld because they felt they didn't have space for him in
the side a year ago, were joined by Bay of Plenty back-row man Aaron
Irwin last week.
Irwin, a more than capable utility back-five player, once hacked off
two of his fingers with a chain saw. It's a shame really. How well he
would have fitted in with the dirty sods of the Jordanhill pack of
yesteryear. Wonderful memories.

SCOTLAND'S dominance of the #32,600 Saga International Open continued
in Preston yesterday when the second round got underway.
Cumbernauld's Hugh Duff and Midlothian's Paul Conlan both eased
through to the quarter-finals, but there was disappointment for
Bainfield's Alex Marshall who threw away a great chance of beating Mark
McMahon from Hong Kong.
Marshall took the opening set 7-4, and then missed a last bowl draw in
the second that would have given him victory.
Duff, the world champion in 1988, had to battle hard before seeing off
a determined challenge from Crown Green man Robert Hitchen, Duff finally
wrapping up a 7-6, 3-7, 7-5 win. Scottish champion Paul Conlan survived
a disastrous start to beat Belfast's David Corkhill in three sets.
Corkhill, a former Superbowl winner, capitalised on a nervy start from
the Midlothian man to take the opening set 7-0 in just three ends but
Conlan squared with a 7-3 win in the second.

CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE ROUND-UP
Rosenborg 2 Blackburn 1
ALAN Shearer remained in defiant mood last night despite Blackburn's
2-1 defeat against Rosenborg in a Group B match in Trondheim.
The English side looked to have resurrected their European dream when
Mike Newell scored after 63 minutes, equalising a goal from Karl-Petter
Loken on the half-hour mark.
But Rosenborg took the points when Stale Stensaas fired home the
winner with just four minutes remaining to leave Blackburn still looking
for their first Champions' League point after two games.
However, Shearer refused to concede that Rovers will not grab one of
the top two group places. ''We're not out of it yet,'' he said.
''There's 12 points to play for and we'll fight to the end.
''But we're disappointed to have conceded a late goal after getting
back into the game. When we got the goal there was only one team going
to win it, but we got hit by a sucker punch.''
However, one man who was not in Norway for Rovers' important tie was
Kenny Dalglish, the former manager chosing instead to travel to Fir Park
to watch his son, Paul, play for Celtic against Motherwell.
Two goals from Finland's Jari Litmanen helped Ajax to a 5-1 away
victory at Ferencvaros, while troubled Spanish champions Real Madrid
stayed in contention in Group D by beating Switzerland's Grasshoppers
2-0.
Spartak Moscow had to withstand a fraught final 10 minutes to gain a
2-1 success against Legia Warshaw in their Champions' League, Group B,
match in the Russian capital last night.
Spartak maintained their 100% in the group thanks to goals from Yuri
Nikiforov, with a penalty after 14 minutes, and Sergei Yuran just after
the interval.
The Polish side reduced the arrears five minutes from time with a
header from defender Marek Jozwiak and then pounded the Russians' goal
but there was no more scoring.
In Portugal, Aalborg, who replaced Dynamo Kiev inthe tournament, went
down 2-0 against Bobby Robson's Porto, boith goals coming from Rui
Barros.
Germany's Werder Bremen proved far too strong for the Irish
part-timers of Glenavon in a UEFA Cup tie, Bremen winning 5-0 on the
night and 7-0 on aggregate.

MORE often associated with royalty and rigorous outdoor activities,
Gordonstoun has shed its past image to emerge as one of the top rugby
schools in Scotland this season, judging by their results in the early
part of the session. These include wins over Merchiston (20-5) last
Saturday, Morrison's Academy (47-0), and, on Tuesday, Stirling County
under-18s (29-11).
''This is the strongest side we have had,'' admitted Chris Barton, the
master in charge of rugby at Gordonstoun,.
''We have a big pack that allows us to win a lot of ball,'' said
Barton, who has three Scottish Schools representative players -- Fergie
Gladstone, Tom Lightoller, and Stuart Linden -- in his side.
Gladstone, one of the successes of the Schools side last season, plays
at No.8 for Gordonstoun but hopes to revert to the blind-side flank
position internationally.
It is noteworthy that the burly back-row forward, a descendant of
Prime Minister Gladstone, packs down alongside one of royal lineage --
Peter Phillips, the son of the Princess Royal.
Phillips, who was among the try scorers for Gordonstoun on Tuesday at
Forthbank Stadium, is described by Barton as ''very athletic and a good
all-round games player''.
Gordonstoun's form this year has certainly been helped by their
pre-season tour to Australia where they won four of their six matches
with victories over Northern Territory under-19s in Darwin, Anglican
Grammar School in Brisbane, Kings Paramatta and Scots College in Sydney.
Barton acknowledges that despite the good start there are some tough
matches ahead for Gordonstoun who he says ''are keen to develop quality
fixtures -- even if that means a lot of travelling''.
Travelling is also a necessity for that other north-east stronghold of
schools rugby, Robert Gordon's College, who, despite the current hype
surrounding the game, are now the only school playing rugby in Aberdeen.
But at least the College are upholding the tradition of rugby in the
Granite City with some improved performances, the best being their 29-26
win over Stewart's-Melville College last Saturday.
''We had a couple of lean seasons but we now seem to have turned the
corner. Prospects look good for next year and the year after,''
predicted Andy Dougall, the former Glasgow centre, and now in charge of
rugby at Robert Gordons.

TV packages are fine, but it has to be separates if you want a system
to blow your socks off
THE big decision is, do you buy separate components or go for an
all-in-one package comprising a large-screen TV with a built-in surround
sound amp and speaker system (the equivalent of the choice between hi-fi
separates or integrated midi/mini music centre)?
As usual, it is not clear-cut and both ways have their advantages.
With the separates option you get a tailor-made system which is also
versatile, allowing you to connect other hi-fi components such as a CD
player, radio tuner, cassette player, and turntable. The amp is likely
to pack a punch and the speaker system can be as good as your budget
allows or chosen to suit your decor. The downside is the expense and the
added hassle of cabling.
Remember you can also use your present hi-fi amplifier if you upgrade
it to an AV amp by adding a Dolby Processor -- usually a Pro-Logic
decoder.
As a supplier of Laser Disc machines, AV amps and other home
cinema/hi-fi separates, Bill Cochrane is in no doubt: ''You can't get a
silk purse from a sow's ear.
''TV packages are fine, but it has to be separates if you want a
system to blow your socks off. Most of the hi-fi companies are now
producing high-quality decoding equipment because they are already
involved in high-quality hi-fi and they see a marketplace crying out for
home cinema.
''There's more choice and a wide variety of prices, and the cost of
adding home cinema into an existing set-up is becoming ever cheaper. I
would say you are talking about a good-quality minimum of #500 -- #250
for a Pro-Logic decoder and centre and rear speakers at #250 as well.
That's giving you good kit.''
The advantages of buying a TV with Dolby Pro-Logic built in are cost
(systems are available from just #800) and convenience. Everything comes
in one box and cabling is kept to a minimum. However, the system is not
likely to be as powerful as a separates system and also lacks the
versatility. But if you don't want to integrate your hi-fi with your
surround sound system, it could be your best choice.
If convenience and economy outweigh other considerations, and you
decide to go for a TV with built-in Dolby Pro-Logic, obviously it's the
picture and sound quality that count. If you don't want to set up a
complete five-speaker system, make sure the TV features operating modes
suited to the number of speakers you intend to use. Then you need to
consider whether you want other facilities, such as TeleText.

TONY Gagliano has focused on the lengthy first division campaign which
lies ahead for Murrayfield Royals, thankful that their Benson &amp; Hedges
Cup campaign is behind them.
Royals were the whipping boys of round-robin qualifying Group A,
losing all eight games. Their shot-shy forwards produced a meagre 25
goals while the defence leaked a staggering 98.
But the Italian-American and his team-mates remain optimistic that
their losing streak can be halted when they square-up to sides of the
same calibre in the league.
''We were up against premier division sides in the cup and you have to
remember that this team was created out of almost nothing during the
summer after the previous club, Racers, withdrew from competition.
''The cup was always going to be a learning process and, hopefully,
the lessons learned will be carried over.''
Royals league odyssey opens on Saturday with a trip to Telford Tigers,
and 24 hours later they entertain Bracknell Bees.
Other first-division action features a home double-header for Paisley,
who host Bracknell on Saturday and Peterborough on Sunday, while
Dumfries Vikings square up to Peterborough Pirates on Saturday before
travelling to Manchester the following day.
Scotland's only premier-division club, Fife Flyers, entertain Cardiff
Devils, who are expected to ice former Kirkcaldy favourite Steve Moria.

If you want a mind-blowing experience when you're watching a film on
TV then home cinema is the answer
CUT to the chase. You're watching the film Speed; you've become so
engrossed that it's as if you're in the passenger seat of the parked car
on screen. Suddenly and instinctively you are forced to duck as an
airborne vehicle roars into view in the top of your windscreen and lands
in the road in front of your bonnet.
The realism of the screaming engine as it passes overhead and the
sickening crunch as the car suspension bottoms could surely only be an
edge-of-the-cinema-seat experience, a product of the big screen's
sophisticated surround sound. In fact, you're seated firmly in your
favourite armchair, gripping your Nicam video controller, and revelling
in the comfort of your own home.
Welcome to the home cinema club; the electronic home entertainment
industry is taking off.
''If you want a mind-blowing experience when you're watching a film on
TV then home cinema is the answer,'' said Bill Cochrane of Laser Audio
at St Marnock Place, Kilmarnock.
''Home cinema is something new. People have had video and TV, but home
cinema is the concept of taking the visual aspect of things and,
crucially, the sound aspect -- actually utilising the information that
has been end-coded on to the film sound track by the engineers -- and
combining them.
''You can either buy a TV package, or combine your TV and hi-fi,
either by converting your present hi-fi amplifier or buying a new
amplifier that does both. You can also create surround sound by adding
extra speakers.''
''Until recently, very few people ever thought of connecting the audio
outputs of their video cassette recorder or TV to their hi-fi. All they
did was switch on the TV, and when they couldn't make out the dialogue
they just turned it up -- which didn't help. But if you connect the
audio output of the VCR or whatever into your hi-fi system the sound is
transformed, which proves that the sound quality is there, but the
speaker on the TV is the limiting factor.''
The arrival of Nicam TVs and videos, which can decode stereo signals,
was the first step on the road to true home cinema. This brought
much-improved sound quality.
Now the new surround systems add hi-fi clarity and volume levels, with
floor-shaking subwoofers, which handle the very low bass frequencies
like the drum rolls and the Terminator 2-type explosions, for those who
really want to blow their minds.
All the top manufacturers have moved into home cinema with TV packages
with or without separate components.
''It's big in America and, like everything else, it then finds its way
across the Atlantic to London and works its way up the country.
So what's all the fuss about? As Bill Cochrane said: ''I went to a
home cinema demonstration and they showed the film Clear and Present
Danger in which the law enforcers blow up a drug baron's mansion. I was
sitting in the front seat and I'm not kidding, the shock wave from the
explosion burst right over the top of me, literally lifting the hair on
my head.''
Here are some ways to build a home entertainment system:
* A modern television with Scart and composite video inputs is a must.
Go for a screen size of at least 25in. You can choose a Nicam Digital
Stereo model, or a conventional TV if your VCR has Nicam and if
amplification is to be handled externally. Route the stereo sound from
your Nicam TV or VCR through the amp of your hi-fi system for excellent
stereo effects with Nicam digital stereo broadcasts and hi-fi stereo
video-tapes and Laser Discs*.
If you want to get into surround sound, you can go for a TV with a
built-in Dolby Pro-Logic amp and external speakers.
At the top end of the market, you could consider replacing the TV with
a projection system, or a rear-projection television.
* To add surround sound to your system, expand your stereo amp by
adding an external processor. For the full surround sound effect, you
then need to add a centre ''dialogue'' speaker and rear ''surround''
speakers, and maybe a bass subwoofer.
Another route is to replace your amplifier altogether with an
integrated AV (audio-video) amp. The advantage is that the amp can then
perform video switching functions.
For top quality you can opt for a six-channel system conforming to the
THX standard.
* An all-in-one solution adds Dolby Pro-Logic Surround Sound and a
high-quality Laser Disc* video source to your system.
* A Laser Disc machine plays 12in discs, similar in appearance to
domestic hi-fi CDs, which provide higher-quality digital reproduction.

FRASER Walker, the 1994 Commonwealth Games medallist, aims to begin
the most vital six months of his career with seven victories at this
weekend's Larkhall Open Meet.
The Scot, who trains with Warrington Warriors, ended a long, lean
period by winning the 200 metres medley at the British national
championships in July, and is now focused on regaining his British team
place for both the world short-course championships in Brazil in
December, and the Olympics in Atlanta next year.
''I feel I've got a point to prove and that is why I've changed my
plans and decided to try and get into the world short-course team,''
said Walker, a silver medallist at the inaugural championships two years
ago.
Despite having been dropped from the Scottish side that competed in
this summer's Canadian championships, there is little doubt that, along
with European championship medallist, Graeme Smith, Walker is the
leading Scottish hope to make the Olympics.
Walker's weekend programme includes the two breast-stroke, two medley,
two free-style, and the 100m butterfly events.
Milngavie and Bearsden's internationalists Forbes Dunlop and Tom
Griffith are also in a strong line-up, while Scottish squad member
Kirsty Hope will be chasing several women's titles.
The Scottish inter-district championships -- for non-Scottish squad
swimmers -- takes place on Saturday at Glenrothes.

Visual Arts
ONE'S immediate impression of this exhibition of toys and sculptures
by Czech artist Trejtnar is of a jumble of bizarre objects. Trejtnar's
carved and painted wooden figures fight for space among the
gallery-cum-shop's selection of handcrafted candlesticks, designer
clocks, and jewellery.
In terms of showing off Trejtnar's faintly disturbing creations to
their best advantage, it's not entirely successful, but as gallery
manager Susan Barnard points out, Studio One is primarily a shop, with
the exhibition space growing from the commercial operation.
Trejtnar's work is very much of the Eastern European tradition of
slightly sinister animation and puppet theatre. This finds its
best-known examples in the disturbing imagery of film-maker Jan
Svankmajer, or more popularly in such imported children's TV series,
screened in the late sixties, as Tales from Europe.
Trejtnar is patently steeped in his country's traditions of visual
theatre, having trained, served his apprenticeship, and worked
extensively in Prague's arts and drama schools, theatres, and animation
studios.
His work undoubtedly shares something of the grotesque surrealism of
Svankmajer et al. One ''toy'', a beautifully carved express train, is in
fact part train, part-pity-me-looking-human, painted in glowing
psychedelic hues: Thomas the Tank Engine on mind-altering substances.
Not, I would suggest, the ideal Christmas stocking-filler for a small
person!
My particular favourites: The Fishing Man, with evil's shark's-head
feet, and the succinctly-titled Long Shoe Lace, a two-foot high wooden
figure with pinhead, enormous shoes, and long laces by which he
struggles to drag himself forward, seemed most successful in striking a
balance between the poles of humorous whimsy and sinister grotesquery.
Until September 30.

Express Tour victory of the season, while her England team-mate Caroline
Hall, the 21-year-old Bristol player, chases her second win this year.
Defending champion Corinne Dibnah will start among the favourites. The
33-year-old Australian, who also won the event in 1991, beat Scotland's
Dale Reid at the second play-off hole to triumph last year.
Other former winners teeing off at Ill Picciolo -- a new venue for the
event -- are Florence Descampe, of Belgium, (1990) and Spaniard's Xonia
Wunsch Ruiz (1989) and Amaia Arruti (1993).

RADIO is a much more visual medium than television. I was driving
along the Dublin-Naas road yesterday listening to the Gay Byrne
programme on RTE during which a woman attending a ploughing competition,
of all things, was being shown a copy of the magazine Playboy.
The reason for this soon became clear. After 36 years the Irish
Republic is lifting its ban on this publication and it will be on sale
to citizens of all ages next week. So what did our lady make of it all?
There was a rustle of pages as, presumably, she flipped to the
centre-fold. ''Would you let your husband see that?'' inquired the
presenter.
''Sure,'' she replied, ''he sees a lot better in the bedroom every
night.'' I just managed to keep the car on the straight and narrow.
The decision to uplift the ban was taken by the Censorship Appeals
Board which consists of two women and three men, chaired by a former TD
(MP). They were unanimous but the public reaction was mixed.
A spokesman for the Christian Solidarity Party declared the issue was
''very serious and a threat to family life''. The Irish Council for
Civil Liberties said the ban was ''silly'' and it was glad to see it go.
But Ms Olive Braiden of the Rape Crisis Centre insisted Playboy was
part of ''a continuum of pornographic-style material that led to the
abuse and subjugation of women. It portrays them as sexual objects and
leads men to think they can have power over them''. I haven't seen a
copy for years but it certainly never did that for me, I must confess.
On the radio show the vote was 9-1 in favour of allowing the public to
make up their own minds. ''You can send for it by post at the moment,''
one pointed out, bringing back memories of the plain, brown envelope.
Does the un-banning of a magazine in Ireland have any political
significance? Yes, I think it does, seen against the background of
social change in the Republic which has a knock-on effect throughout the
whole island. If the South can move into the twentieth century maybe the
North will be reassured.
Officially suppressing images of the nude body served only to create a
furtive, neurotic attitude to sex in Ireland and many psychosexual
problems flowed from that. Abuse, incest and deviancy tended to be
hushed up. Those days are gone; not even men of the cloth can hide their
sins any more.
A much more serious test of the ''new Irish'' attitude will come this
November when the country votes, yet again, to decide whether to
legalise divorce. The Government Coalition parties, Fine Gael and
Labour, are praying for a ''Yes'' vote, the main opposition Fianna Fail
are content ''to let the people decide'' and the Catholic Church is just
praying.
''They had better not try to lecture anyone about moral issues this
time,'' a female journalist told me. ''Not after what their lot have
been proved to be doing!''
Starting with the Bishop of Galway, who suddenly had to admit he had a
son in America, there have been a string of cases involving priests up
to no sexual good, according at least to the doctrines they seek to
impose upon others. In the latest ''shock'' revelations it has been
revealed that the Bishop of Ferns, Dr Brendan Comiskey, has clocked up
75,000 air miles on six holidays to Thailand in the last two years.
It is not quite clear why His Grace finds the Thai scene quite so
stimulating but he was once reportedly detained at Bangkok Airport while
under the influence of strong drink. Hard to believe, really.
The Church's opposition to changing the divorce laws may be put by
laymen but the case will lack nothing in its fervour. Gerard Casey, a
leading figure in the ''No'' camp gave notice of the kind of argument to
be expected last week.
''Marriage, as it currently exists in this country, is a permanent and
exclusive union of one man and one woman, constituted by the complete
and unconditional gift of each to the other. Once divorce is introduced
it has the effect of making all marriages conditional affairs.''
That is powerfully-put baloney but it serves as a frightener to many.
So too does the old scare about the division of assets, notably land in
this country, following a break-up.
Yet thousands of marriages still come apart, even without divorce, and
couples are left in a loveless limbo. Even more significant, perhaps, is
that many people do not get wed at all.
The number of marriages in the Republic has dropped by 31% in the past
20 years. Over the same period there has been a huge increase in births
to non-married people, from 3% to nearly 20%.
Those figures alone should provide a good enough case for allowing
divorce but no-one is complacent about the result. After a thoroughly
nasty and divisive campaign in 1986, the cause was lost and there are
many who believe it will be a close vote once more.
The events of the next two months will be thoroughly monitored in the
North. Maintaining peace on this island is not just about silencing the
guns. It is also necessary to reassure the Unionists that any political
change does not condemn them to co-operate with a country which denies
basic rights to its citizens.
Permitting divorce, or even the sale of Playboy, is unlikely to bring
dramatic changes of attitude but it does mean there is less to complain
about.
In the meantime we wait, with bated breath, to see who will be brave
enough to be the first Irish centre-fold!

FOR years the issue of a dedicated dance base in Glasgow has been
chewed over at meeting after meeting. Tonight at 6pm in the Tramway
there's to be another. Chaired by the CCA's new director, Penny Rae --
who has worked extensively in various areas of dance development -- it
will be an open forum for forward planning. There's no formal panel
setting the agenda with personal woes or requirements.
The starting point for tonight's discussion is the statement --
contained in the Scottish Arts Council's current corporate plan -- that
one of the key issues for 1995/96 is the establishment of a dance centre
in Glasgow. They have earmarked cash towards this -- around #6000 to
begin with -- and this will be matched by Glasgow's department of
performing arts and venues.
Already there has been a self-generated initiative from within
Glasgow's dance community. The Glasgow Dance Project has recently been
running classes -- both professional and public -- in Maryhill Community
Central Hall. Prior to that, Rosina Bonsu ran the Dance Bothy at
Strathclyde Arts Centre. Both schemes came up against familiar
stumbling-blocks: the space was not their own -- activities had to fit
in with the building's other uses -- and there was no-one actively in
charge and there all the time.
So what are Glasgow's dance makers looking for? A rehearsal room with
good technical facilities? A resource for professionals or part of a
wider provision that includes the community?
Prioritising between needs and desires can be a real struggle, and
alongside all the ideals, of course, is the current reality of what is
on offer: some #12,000 and the use of an interim space from within the
DPAV's spectrum of property.
Woodside Halls has, I believe, been suggested as a possibility. Penny
Rae -- and the various representatives from the SAC and DPAV -- are keen
to hear from the dance-makers how they feel this initial provision
should be used. What, for instance, are the feelings about using a
sizable chunk of the money to fund a feasibility study that might
attract greater subsidy from bodies such as the Lottery Fund?
Hope to hear conflicting views at tonight's discussion. For that would
mean that the diversity of voices already within the city had chosen to
turn up and speak up at a meeting which is happening because dance
matters within this city.

Dublin
SCOTLAND'S Sam Torrance, one of the heroes of the famous Ryder Cup
victory last weekend, was an angry man yesterday.
Slammin' Sam, current leader of the Volvo European Order of Merit, is
still waiting to be invited to play in the World Matchplay Golf
Championship at Wentworth on October 12 to 14 . . . and he wants to know
why.
''Others have received their invitation -- why not me?'' said
Torrance. ''They surely cannot ignore me after all that has happened
this season. I sat around all day yesterday waiting to hear. I am
extremely annoyed.''
He has every right to be. The organisers of the event are the Mark
McCormack owned IMG company, who have issued several controversial
invitations, usually to their own clients, in the past.
They insisted yesterday: ''The field is not set yet. We will not
confirm who is playing until after the German Masters on October 6.''
But earlier they had indicated the participants would be invited after
the Ryder Cup. It also is known that Costantino Rocca and Colin
Montgomerie have already been asked to take part.
The snub has merely increased Torrance's determination to stay atop
the order of merit. He resumes that battle today when he lines up for
the #650,000 Smurfit European Open at the K Club, just outside Dublin.
After the historic Ryder Cup triumph, the excitement is still rippling
through the European golf scene, and nowhere is that more apparent than
in Ireland, home of the match-clinching hero Philip Walton.
When the team plane touched down at Dublin Airport there were
thousands of jubilant supporters to welcome them.
Ireland's best-known gambler, J P McManus, paid a fortune just to
journey to and from America with Bernard Gallacher's side. And tickets
for this week's event are much-prized possessions.
Ten of the 12 men who represented Europe will play at the K Club, only
Nick Faldo and Seve Ballesteros are giving the tournament a miss. In
addition, one of the vanquished Americans, the popular Tom Lehman, is in
the field.
Torrance's main challenger for the top spot in the order of merit is
his countryman, Montgomerie. So far Sam has earned #619,138, while Monty
is just #29,082 behind him.
The first prize in the Irish competition is #108,330 so the positions
could be changed by Sunday night.
''He is relentless -- he will chase me all the way to the line,''
declared Sam. ''But I am still on a high. Anyway, I'm prettier.''
Montgomerie restricted his comments to saying he liked the lay-out of
the course. Designed by Arnold Palmer, it measures 7159 yards and, with
winds of 50mph yesterday, was certainly providing a stiff test.
Bernhard Langer spoke for many of the European team when he said: ''We
are tired, but after the 1991 Ryder Cup I managed to win the German
Masters the following weekend. It doesn't take too long to get down to
business again.''
Lehman, who also will play in the German event, has arrived with his
wife, Melissa, daughters Rachael and Holly, plus two-month-old son
Thomas Jr.
''I wish we could play the Ryder Cup all over again next week,'' he
admitted. ''Two years is a long time to wait for revenge.
''But we have to put all that behind us now. I am happy with the
course here, it is very American and I feel quite at home. It would be
some consolation if I could become the European champion.''
David Gilford is the holder of the title and is going for a hat trick.
Those looking for a fresh, non-Ryder Cup participant on whom to put
their money might risk a wager on the young man who won this
championship in 1979 by seven clear shots.
He tells me he is just about ready to win again. His name is Sandy
Lyle.
* SCOTLAND squad member Les McLaughlin will be hoping to complete a
notable treble in the Martell Cognac Scottish Club Championship at
Cochrane Castle on Sunday.
The man who caddied for Stephen Dundas in the US Masters in 1993 was a
member of Cowglen's winning side in the tournament in 1988 and '89 and
now with partners Colin Carson and John McDonald, is aiming to pick up
the silverware again.
Other strong challengers could well be Blairgowrie, Irvine, and Moray,
who will be attempting to take the title north for the first time.
Competing clubs are:
Blairgowrie, Broomieknowe, Camperdown, Cowal, Cowglen, East Kilbride,
Greenock, Irvine, Kelso, Milngavie, Moray, Murcar, Pitreavie, Stirling,
Stranraer, Tulliallan.

PEOPLE can be so ungrateful, really. All those crabbit critics peeving
on about the Lottery. So grudging in their admiration for the ingenuity
of inventing a tax so popular people line up to pay it on a Saturday
night, and curse and rail when the machines go down, a tax so simple
that even schoolchildren slink off for pay-as-you-rob amusement amid a
litter of torn up Scratchcards.
No wonder Mrs Bottomley's exasperated. What the carpers fail to
appreciate is the brilliance of the scam.
Of course the lottery makes the poor poorer! That's the beauty of it.
It shouldn't take two British Medical Journal researchers to irk
Virginia Bottomley by telling her that Lottery spending is highest among
the poor, and linked to lack of education and increases with rising
unemployment. She only has to read Adam Smith.
He it was who described lotteries as a ''tax on all the fools in
creation.'' But what does he know? He's dead and therefore unable to
thrill at the futility of blowing a week's benefit on Scratchcards or
tuning in to a demented Anthea-led greedfest on Saturday nights.
Any fool knows people don't want to pay taxes or VAT on fuel bills or
dentists' fees or prescription charges. But call your fun tax a harmless
wee flutter and your fools are duped into cheerful giving, and giving
again. And surely any fool can see the benefit of the lottery's function
as a national panacea, replacing religion in our age of secularism, as
an addictive opiate.
What the moaning minnies don't appreciate is that if the gamblers took
time out of the lottery queue to weigh up the the real odds, their true
prospects in life, they might be inclined to revolt -- or at least vote
-- instead of being kept in a perpetual state of futile hope.
Anyway, how else could the repulsive mix of greed, envy and naked
covetousness that passes for a political culture be so easily
inculcated?
Today the National Lottery Charities Board, that big, fat, fickle
finger in the sky, will hope to pacify the critics with an announcement
about where the lottery grants to charities will be spent and who is to
get a share of #150m.
The first bundle, it's been promised, will go to improve the quality
of life of people who are disadvantaged by poverty. Since the speciality
of the lottery is to extract money from people with none to spare, it's
only fair. Only killjoys would suggest handing it back to the poor
suckers who shelled it out.
You will be pleased to hear that a 94-year-old, one-legged ex-soldier
eking out his last years in an eventide home funded by the sale of his
former council house, a Mr Herbert McFadzean, is hoping for a grant of
#19m to gift to the nation the contents of his correspondence file with
the Department of Social Security over its refusal of an attendance
allowance for his blind wife. It also includes his pre-1945 letters to
his mother from a TB sanitorium asking her to sell his granny to pay the
fees.
A Lottery spokesman said that as a fine example of the rise and fall
of the welfare state and the almost forgotten use of a neglected form of
tax to fund it, the award might qualify for a national heritage grant.
Such has been the success of the Lottery that, I believe, strenuous
efforts could be made to extend the concept. All this fuss about funding
a National Health Service, for instance, might be solved at a stroke
(just so long as it's a minor one): Scratchcards could be given away
free at birth.
In the event of medical emergency, a quick rub might reveal a pair of
matching hernias, entitling you to a truss. Four gets you the op, while
three would definitely qualify you for a place on the waiting list to
get on the waiting list.
Scratch for a couple of hearts and you get the by-pass. Rub off the
bonus point for a transplant. Unlucky losers might die but since the
odds are stacked against them anyway, what's the difference? You can
mock. But I suspect that even now in Tayside's health trust someone is
yelling ''Eureka''.
Some say the country's obsession with the lottery is unfairly blamed
for all manner of ills. There is now firm evidence that the vast amount
of friction given off when rubbing Scratchcards may be responsible for
the expanding hole in the ozone layer.
Greenpeace, I can reveal, are devising plans to send a bunch of men in
hooded shellsuits to storm newsagents' and supermarkets to halt the
explosion of a dangerous environmental and cultural pollutant. They are
thought unlikely to survive.
What do you mean you don't believe me? Why not, when you go on
believing that the Finger Fairy will deliver you a jackpot for the price
of a pound?

Opera
THE last time the young company, Opera on a Shoestring, appeared at
the Cottier Theatre -- with La Traviata during Mayfest -- they packed
the place, night after night. The singers must have been disappointed,
then, with the surprisingly thin turnout last night for their new show,
a gala presentation of opera extracts. Poor or inadequate publicity was
suggested as a possible reason.
A pity, because, in a sense, the company was breaking some new ground
last night. Well, maybe not new, but certainly -- in terms of operatic
pops shows -- relatively unfamiliar.
In fact I don't think I've heard some of the numbers they sang last
night in this context. They included the ultimate melter, the sumptuous
trio for female voices from the last act of Richard Strauss's Der
Rosenkavalier (tear-jerkingly sung by Gillian Taylor, Christina
Dunwoodie, and Margaret Izatt). It was also in this number, where
pianist Julia Lynch was a bit tentative, that the overall sound
suggested that the piano lid might usefully be opened a notch -- these
are big voices, and they need a full accompaniment.
More rarities -- and beauties -- in this pops format were the love
duet from the end of Act One of Verdi's Otello (in which Dunwoodie and
tenor Luigi Corvi will have you reaching for the tissues again),
followed by Dunwoodie's spellbinding account of Desdemona's Willow Song.
The wonderful quartet from Fidelio and the sextet from Lucia di
Lammermoor came into the same category.
The rest of the show contains the old warhorses -- from Puccini to
Delibes and Mozart -- with the company, including the irrepressible
Graeme Danby, the intense tenor Campbell Russell, and sonorous baritone
Ivor Klayman, in fine form. Same show tomorrow night, 7.30pm.

SO somehow last night Seal's taken these three half-decent songs
hostage. Will he let them live? One, the courtly Kiss From A Rose, he
sets free with its features intact. Another one, Crazy, gets the
clapalong treatment -- the audience all wantonly incited to put their
hands together above their heads to give the song a right cabbaging.
Nevertheless, at the end it's still got a faint pulse.
What Seal does to Killer, though. O-o-o-o-o. Nasty. Killer gets slowed
down, over-inflated, and horribly smeared with bad guitar. It's a goner.
Never stood a chance.
You have to look on the bright side, though. At least the other nine
or 10 songs Seal churned out last night never felt a thing, what with
them being corpses already. Sad, flavourless, mid-paced things they
were.
Rock'n'roll? More plod'n'platitude, thud'n'blunder, plus Seal's reedy
voice and his non-specific rock-star movements. Here a detumescent
snake-shimmy, there a vague crowd-wards extension of the arms. Lyrics
from the problems page of a D C Thomson teeny-mag, too. No-one
understands. Don't be so hard on yourself. Hold on to love.
''Seal? Oh, he's right up there in the pop pantheon -- alongside
Howard Jones, Nick Kershaw and Chesney Hawkes.'' So my companion
sniggered at the evening's conclusion. No . . . that's not actually
true. I didn't take a companion with me last night. I couldn't find
anyone whose existence was so devoid of form and meaning that they'd go
along.
But yon Seal does make Howard Jones seem like a superior artistic
being. A deadly talent indeed.

GLASGOW'S shortage of top class office space will continue well into
next year, warns a leading commercial property agent. With demand
increasing, the city's limited supply of Grade A space has been further
reduced.
If development momentum is to be maintained, work must start soon on
the 126,000 sq ft planned for completion next year. Launching his firm's
latest Glasgow Office Market Bulletin, Craig Ritchie of surveyors
Richard Ellis said: ''Compared with 1994, take-up this year has been
very healthy and, on the back of steady demand, development has awoken
this year.
''But the shortage of Grade A space will continue well into 1996.''
Speculative completions in the city this year will total some 142,600
sq ft, a significant increase on last year's 11,000 sq ft. With demand
increasing from the banking, finance and insurance sectors, some 307,000
sq ft was let in the city in the first six months of this year -- a 32%
increase on 1994. Two Grade A units in Tay House were let to the Royal
Bank of Scotland and the Offshore Supplies Office.
The largest letting was of 51,710 sq ft of Grade A space in the
Grosvenor, Gordon Street, to Scottish Amicable Investment Managers.
As a result of these and other deals the city's office stock is at a
five-year low, with some 1.2m sq ft currently available, of which only
156,000 sq ft is classified as Grade A by Richard Ellis. Three high
quality speculative office schemes are nearing completion in the city
centre, but although their specification is good and they are
well-located, with floorplates of under 8000 sq ft they will not reach
Grade A definition.
The report also reveals that at #17 per sq ft, top rents in the city
have not moved for the last two years, having peaked at #18.50 in late
1992. In the investment market, capital transactions totalled some #26m
in the six months to June, a 13% increase on the second half of last
year.
Investors continue to be attracted by prime buildings with good
covenants and long leases. They are also prepared to look outside the
prime core. But despite of the lack of prime product, investors are
still wary of getting involved in speculative funding.
Record rental deal in Argyle Street
A record rental deal has put Argyle Street back on top of Glasgow's
retail league table. In an off-market transaction, UK retail chain
Allsports has agreed to pay #153 per sq ft for the Etam unit opposite
Marks &amp; Spencer. The previous best rental for Argyle Street's prime
pitch was around #128 per sq ft.
The Etam unit is owned by Great Universal Stores, which bought out
Etam's lease to conclude the deal. It is understood that Allsports,
represented by surveyors Morgan Martin, faced tough competition from
Clinton Cards, with a #140 per sq ft bid.
Letting agents were Colliers Erdman Lewis.
The deal demonstrates the determination of major southern-based
retailers to find outlets in Glasgow. The city has a reputation for
strong sales levels, even during the current downturn.
Allsports will move into the Etam unit on 17 November.
Meanwhile, Montagu Evans has announced three new lettings at the
former Arnott's store on Argyle Street. Shelley's Shoes is paying
#220,000 per annum for 6200 sq ft of space on three levels. Nike is
taking 2500 sq ft on the ground floor at a rental of #275,000. Jeanster
is paying #145,000 for a 2600 sq ft unit on two levels.

AS Clare Henry suggests in her article on Open Doors Day, it's quite
the most brilliant idea ever (September 16)
All sorts of interesting buildings are open for the public to visit,
but who knows about it? Is Saturday morning not a bit late for
organising what you're doing for the weekend? There's not nearly so many
open on Sunday.
Who are the organisers encouraging to visit Glasgow's finest
buildings? It isn't exactly well-advertised. I found out by chance as I
have for the past two years.
This is far too important an event to be open doors only to the
in-club.

Andrew Douglas finds a new recognition of the high standards expected
in the tourism industry
THE long hot summer that has now burned out encouraged many who had
not booked holidays abroad to stay at home. And as the last-minute
reductions to exotic parts were ignored, those left at home took stock
of the scenery, attractions and flavour of their own country.
Day trips to the seaside, the hills and country brought the
realisation that much had changed in the way of better service, and
hoteliers and restauranteurs were determined to please. Scotland was
steadily being perceived as a country that had awoken as a leading
contender in the arena of serious visitor attractions.
But the splendour of Scotland need not be dismissed to a pile of
summer snapshots in the back of a drawer. Many of the country's visitor
attractions are open all year round, and those which close by the end of
September are extending their season by a couple of months.
Specialist holidays that cater for the golfer or the fisherman are
well established throughout the autumn and winter, and many hotels and
guest houses link up with golf courses to provide competitive packages.
The fishing and shooting fraternity often benefit too, from a hotelier's
links with the local laird.
If enjoyment of scenery, whether mountains, sea, or loch is what you
want, then Scotland is unsurpassed. Spectacular views are what Scotland
can offer and in autumn the changing colours of the hills, and the blaze
of heather is comparable to New England forests of golden hue. The
rivers may be a little fuller, the waterfalls a little angrier, and the
sea a little louder but the hotels you drop into on your travels through
great glens and beneath the shadows of rugged peaks will give you that
same warm welcome whatever the season.
And if Scotland has revealed a little more of itself in the past few
years, then it is in the quality and the standard of its food. A
gourmet's mecca would be no exaggeration to describe what this country
can offer. Aberdeen Angus beef, freshly caught salmon and trout,
venison, game pie and local cheeses followed by a few drams and some
buttered bannocks. And it need not be a luxury hotel that is the sole
provider of such fare, for many of Scotland's B&amp;B landladies are
excellent cooks and have created their own recipes using local produce.
But choosing which direction to go may be the most difficult decision
to make. In the next month or two there are many attractive and
interesting events being held around the country.
Clydesdale District Arts Festival is being staged at venues throughout
the region and farther south in the Borders, Kelso races get into stride
as does the Borders festival. At Gatehouse of Fleet the carnival
atmosphere continues with an Oktober Beerfest.
At Perth theatre the autumn season gets under way, and Inverness is
visited by the Moscow Festival Ballet. Music is in abundance with
festivals in Aviemore, Lerwick and Aberdeen; jazz it up in Dunoon or
make for the Royal National Mod in Golspie.
For sports enthusiasts try the Tiree Wave Classic, a surfing
competition that lasts for one week or visit St Andrews for the Dunhill
Cup. A car rally goes on for three days round the island of Mull, but if
energy is no problem there's the Great Glen Relay Running Race between
Fort William and Inverness.
The cities are not without their own attractions and in Glasgow the
Modern Homes exhibition will draw the crowds as will the Scottish Motor
Show at the SECC. At the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh, Rik Mayall
appears in Bottom while Phantom of the Opera is being staged at the
Playhouse. Murrayfield sees the clash between Scotland and Samoa. In
Aberdeen, the university's quincentenary celebrations get under way,
while fireworks light up the sky in Skye, Motherwell, Bridge of Allan
and Forres.
Scotland is a country full of contrasts from the remote, rugged and
barren landscapes of the north, where sheep outnumber man by 1000 to
one, to the Solway coast, warmed by the Gulf Stream and where
subtropical plants flourish amid a lush greenery that is prolific with
dairy herds.
In a country with a rich historic past there are still many museums
and visitor centres where the Scotland of old is brought to life. Many
visitor attractions are open all year round, perhaps with restricted
times throughout the winter, but many do close and it is worth checking
before making a long journey.
The Scottish tourism industry has moved quickly in anticipation of an
upturn of visitors during the autumn, and has introduced a package in
association with many businesses to offer discounts. More than 500
tourism businesses are taking part in the campaign to increase autumn
tourism in Scotland.
With the acquisition of an Autumn Goldcard, the holidaymaker will
benefit from a whole range of worthwhile discounts whenever they see the
Autumn Gold sign. Travel by bus, train and plane will be reduced by up
to 50%. Hotels are offering special packages such as three nights for
the price of two or complimentary meals.
Many of Scotland's places of historic interest, which often close at
the end of September, are staying open longer and are offering
incentives to visit. Among those taking part in the scheme are British
Airways, British Midland, Stagecoach, Scotrail and Intercity, Stakis,
Thistle and Lovat hotels and Historic Scotland.
The Autumn Gold offers will be valid from Friday September 29 to
Thursday November 30. To receive a free Autumn Goldcard and a brochure
listing a selection of the offers available phone Autumn Goldline on
0345 511511 or write to Autumn Gold, c/o Holiday Scotland, FREEPOST,

CONSTRUCTION
DESPITE difficult trading conditions in the housing and construction
markets, Tarmac managed to increase its underlying operating profits by
23% to #50.2m. However, a #45m exceptional item relating to the loss on
the sale of its building materials, clay bricks, and pavers business to
Ibstock, dragged Tarmac into a #16m pre-tax loss.
There was no news on the sale of the housing division, the UK's second
biggest housebuilder, although chief executive Neville Simms said ''a
number of approaches'' had been made. A trade sale or financial sale
could be on the cards but Mr Simms said there would be no rush to sell
the business. It is expected to fetch around #300m. A prospectus
accompanying the sale is due to be published within the next few weeks.
In the first six months of the year lower volumes and prices resulted
in the housing division's profitability dropping from #18.9m to #8.7m.
There are currently few signs of recovery in the housing market with
underlying net reservations down on the same period last year.
The construction business did well to contain its drop in profits to
#800,000 at #2.9m. A smaller road building and maintenance programme was
largely to blame for the shortfall. Mr Simms said he thought
construction margins had gone ''through the trough''.
Indeed, Tarmac has witnessed an improvement in the quality of its
forward order book, benefiting from its spread of regional offices. The
Government's Private Finance Initiative is expected to have an
increasingly positive impact on Tarmac's construction division. It is
currently involved in contracts to build a prison and a small hospital
and is optimistic about its chances of winning a major road contract.
While housing and construction remain difficult areas for the
business, there are some optimistic signs for the future. The building
materials sector performed strongly helped by higher prices. Tarmac's
American business is starting to make a growing contribution to the
group's profitability. Tarmac has high hopes for its French business
which is expected to be one of the recipients of the housing disposal
proceeds.
The group's cash position deteriorated in the first half partly due to
delays in payment from public sector clients. This led to an increase in
borrowings which is expected to partially unwind in the second half.
Overcapacity remains a problem for the entire building and
construction industry and so Tarmac's decision to dispose of its housing
business makes long-term financial sense. The group's future growth is
expected to come from an expanded aggregates business and the provision
of a broader range of professional services.
The interim results were in line with City expectations, but in the
absence of any news on the sale of the housing division, the shares
slipped 2p to 88p.

I WRITE to endorse the concern of Mr George Robertson, the Shadow
Secretary of State for Scotland, about abusive language in politics
(September 25). I also wish to tackle other forms of political abuse
because of their more than probable encouragement of the lunatic and
violent fringes.
The electoral system of first past the post with its cynical
concentration on marginal areas, eg the Essex man, has virtually
disenfranchised the North of England, Wales, and Scotland.
A Government with a philosophy rejected by these areas has imposed its
policies and may continue to do so by careful targeting of marginal
seats. The situation in Wales and Scotland is particularly acute with
Ministers of State appointed by a political party rejected by both
nations.
The cover-up of shady arms deals by classifying the information as an
official secret is an abuse of democracy unworthy of the Mother of
Parliaments. The Nolan Committee is another example of the official
cover-up of probable scandals with its subsequent de-authorisation by
the party of government.
Monklands District Council has followed the Westminster pattern with
its Black report. Sovereignty is now the prerogative of the majority
party.
A system of proportional representation ensures government of all the
people, by all the people, and for all the people without revolutionary
changes like nationalisation, subsequent denationalisation,
privatisation, educational and health reforms, reforms of local
government, etc (many subservient only to the political ideology of the
majority party and with their respective quangos).
Government by majority rule in Britain has become a dictatorship
imposing on communities open-cast mining, extensions to quarries,
motorways through woodlands, dumping of oil platforms, storage of

More and more groups without an effective voice in the decision-making
process are driven to public protests. Only proportional representation
can ensure law, order, and democracy.

Sydney, Wednesday -- Media magnate Rupert Murdoch's family stake in
his global media empire News Corporation has fallen to a historic low as
the group whips up new capital in a drive to expand the company, a stock
exchange notice today showed.
Murdoch's family shareholding in News Corp has dropped to 30.89% from
32.63%, according to a notice lodged with the Australian Stock Exchange
by Murdoch's personal holding company, Kayarem Pty Limited.
Australian-born Murdoch has seen his family stake in News Corp dwindle
steadily from 45.9% in 1989. But he has maintained a firm grip on
control of the far-flung media group which he inherited from his father,
Sir Keith, in 1952.
Analysts said the drop in Murdoch's personal shareholding reflected a
rapid expansion at News Corp and a swift increase in equity capital
since 1991, when the company nearly sank under debts of A$10bn (#4700m).
News Corp's tie-up with US long-distance telephone company MCI
Communications, announced in May as a move to expand the group into
multimedia operations, contributed to the dilution of News Corp
shareholdings in the past year.
That deal landed MCI with about 155 million News Corp Ordinary shares
when the US$2000m alliance was sealed in early August, which analysts
said diluted shareholdings in the company by 4% to 5%.
''The lower family shareholding is a reflection of the increase in
News Corp's capital base rather than anything else,'' said Nola Hodgson,
media analyst at ANZ McCaughan.
But the analysts said Murdoch appeared determined to retain a large
slice of shares in News Corp's A$23bn (#10.65bn) newspaper, film and
broadcasting empire to pass on to his four children. They doubted his
stake would fall much further.
''I would expect any further selling by Murdoch or his family to be
very small and on the fringe. There may be some more dilution, but I
also think that will be minor in the greater scheme of things,'' one
Sydney-based media analyst said.

NORMAN Hogg's smear on the SNP is a blatant attempt to whip up fear of
independence among Scotland's minority communities. Such gutter tactics
by Labour should have no place in Scottish politics (September 25).
Mr Hogg writes: ''The first requirement of nationalism is a definition
of who qualifies to be a citizen. It inevitably means that some are
excluded.'' Rather than a description of an independent Scotland, this
sounds like a very accurate account of the present UK arrangements -- in
other words, British rather than Scottish nationalism.
SNP policy is that there shall be an automatic right of citizenship to
everyone resident in Scotland -- wherever they are from -- as well as
everyone born in Scotland. The SNP's civic nationalism is an inclusive
message which appeals to Scotland in all her diversity.
My colleagues and I joined the SNP because we identify with Scotland
and her democratic rights. There are many different identities in
Scotland but what we all share is our stake in Scottish society.
Mr Hogg and his party would do far better to assert this point rather
than indulge in ill-advised fearmongering about independence.

ON several occasions Strathclyde's highways committee was warned about
the danger to pedestrians at the junctions of Paisley Road and Glebe
Street, in Renfrew, after a man was killed.
Now a woman aged 83 has been killed trying to cross at this junction.
District councillors have drawn attention to the need for a pedestrian
crossing at this junction, churches have asked for a crossing, likewise
schools. But here is the reply from SRC's principal traffic engineer:
''We carried out pedestrian and traffic surveys in Renfrew but results
showed that the levels in Glebe Street did not warrant a crossing''.
This man is telling the citizens of Renfrew, who have to use this
dangerous crossing perhaps three times per day, that a crossing is not
needed.
In the last month three elderly persons have asked me to post letters
in the pillar-box over the road. Let this official look at the empty
shops on the other side of the junction and ask why they are empty. The
reason is that citizens will not cross to shop in them.

<HEADLINE>National Consumer Council takes radical line. Call for CAP support cuts and end to quotas</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS, FARMING EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>976158895</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE National Consumer Council has called for further radical reforms
of the European Common Agricultural Policy, including a sustained
programme of cuts in support prices until they are in line with
realistic world market levels.
At the same time, they suggest, quantity restrictions such as quotas,
should be phased out and import levies reduced.
In a report published yesterday the council argues for the abolition
of the ''green'' monetary system so the programme of price cuts is not
undermined.
It also suggests that responsibility for policy on direct income
support payments should be devolved to member states. Compensation
payments of the kind introduced under the MacSharry reforms should be
replaced by environmental management payments ''so that farmers are paid
for providing environmental services that society values rather than
receiving a payment to compensate for past subsidy''.
Lady Wilcox, chairman of the NCC, said: ''As taxpayers we are still
footing the bill for storing surpluses, dumping them on world markets
and destroying perfectly good fruit and vegetables. We are paying twice
over -- once as taxpayers to support the CAP regime and then again as
consumers through higher food prices.''
John Ross, president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland,
described the NCC report as ''yet another call for agriculture to be
subject to a totally unsuitable dose of free market economics''.
The council seemed to be unaware that beef and cereals mountains no
longer existed, he said. Cuts in support prices had already occurred.
The proposed policy of replacing EU support schemes with
nationally-determined direct aid to producers would run the risk of
diminishing the competitive position of British producers and
undermining the principle of the Single European Market.
''Our priority is the future well-being of Scottish agriculture, and
its remote and fragile areas,'' he said. ''We understand the pressure on
the CAP for change but the 1992 reform, which provided direct payments
as compensation for cuts in support prices, has brought much-needed
stability. We do not want this jeopardised by ill-considered calls for
change.''
In a review of the workings of the CAP, the report suggests the
pattern over the past 30 years has been one of increasing production
combined with relatively stable -- or in some cases decreasing --
demand.
''In the short to medium term, therefore, reforms need to succeed in
reducing over-production, rather than relying on lower prices to
stimulate demand.''
Dealing with cereals the report contends that many years of too high
levels of support have resulted in severe over-production, and the
MacSharry reforms, while a move in the right direction, are unlikely to
bring production into line with either domestic consumption or the
competitive world market.
On dairy products the recommendations are for a close alignment
between EU prices and world market prices, the phasing out of quotas and
reduction of import duties.
A significant cut in beef prices is also advocated -- more than those
agreed under the MacSharry proposals -- along with the phasing out of
compensatory premium schemes. A similar phasing out of premium schemes
for sheep is called for, replaced where necessary by direct payments --
particularly environmental management payments -- not linked to
production.
Looking ahead to the implications of the eastwards extension of the
European Union, the report suggests that the role of the EU in helping
countries such as Poland and Hungary develop their agricultural sectors
-- without repeating the mistakes of the CAP -- could be more valuable
than almost any amount of other aid it could give.

WHEN I returned to jail, after parole of some 15 years, not much had
changed -- except two things. This short-sentence jail (up to 12 months)
had been upgraded physically -- new gymnasium, showers in all
dormitories, plus a very positive attitude of rehabilitation by the
prison service, but there were more prisoners, and they were worse.
Formerly, a chaplain could expect some respect and work on it, now the
prisoners blamed society for all their ills. The chaplain's wastepaper
basket, by tradition changed from ''Chaplin'' to ''Charlie Chaplin'' was
no longer a joke, but a real commentary on our role.
What do I make of it, the crime-punishment-prison scenario after
another (nearly) three years having been coaxed as a retired minister to
another ''stretch''?
The three most frequent questions which prisoners (officially
''inmates'', to themselves ''cons'') ask are: ''Why do you come here?''
''Why are you here?'' and ''Do you like coming here?''
The answers are: ''The Church has sent me.'' ''I am here to show you
the way to a better life.'' ''No.''
Some disappointment is evident when I give the last reply and I have
to say with courtesy: ''I don't like jails.''
Now, I have to say two things. My knowledge of jails is limited to
this one and to conversations with other chaplains and reading all the
literature which has come to hand. I have read that some jails are more
progressive than ours and others are extremely harsh and inhuman in
other countries.
As a chaplain I must look for the best in every prisoner and, in fact,
this is the policy of the Scottish Prison Service. Sometimes I find this
hard to bear, as other prison officials must do also.
As a minister in the East-end of Glasgow for 33 years I met worthy
people who had good and satisfying lives on their small earnings or
pensions and I cannot accept the oft-repeated plea of prisoners who
shoplift or housebreak to provide for themselves or their families.
And yet!
I believe that we must do more, much more, to provide employment for
those willing to work, and that extreme wealth and poverty must be
abolished in order to create a more just society and one where the
temptation to crime is reduced.
What do I think of prison as a useful way of combating crime?
Not a lot, and I share this opinion with the general public and some
experts. It is reported that it costs #26,000 pa to keep a convict in a
Scottish jail, plus the cost of keeping their families. As 70-80% return
regularly through the ''revolving door'' it does not seem very
cost-efficient.
Do I have any magical solutions to the problem?
First, I would save money by stopping the absurd practice of remand
prisoners, whereby about 50% are freed later after wasting time and
money in jail.
Secondly, I would stop imprisonment for small fines of some #100 or so
and deduct this from social benefits.
Otherwise, are jails necessary?
I am not in favour of lashing women to death for adultery or cutting
off hands for thieving but I do believe that some violent categories of
criminals must be locked up for as long as is necessary for the public
safety.
The three traditional reasons for ''custodial sentences'' are
punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation, and I believe that they are
still valid.
Regarding the first, I believe that the public would be satisfied if
our jails could not be compared to comfortable Butlin-style camps. In a
recent tabloid report my jail was pilloried as one in which there were
luxury-style sports, eg canoeing and hill-walking etc. A prisoner said
to me solemnly: ''This report will give us a bad name, and it's not
true.''
With regard to deterrence, the academics claim that the abolition of
capital punishment has made no change to the incidence of murder. This
may well be true of the past but what of the present and the future with
the escalation of violent and gun crime?
Rehabilitation, called reform in former times. This is the great
thrust today and, as a chaplain, I must give it my whole-hearted
support. The old policy of the prison service aimed to return the
prisoner to a ''good and useful life'' on discharge. Time will tell, and
may it be so.
* Bill Crombie is part-time chaplain at Low Moss Prison, Bishopbriggs.

COMPETITION COUNTDOWN
THE clock began ticking yesterday for 40 young managers who are taking
on this year's Scottish Executive Challenge, a competition organised by
the Institute of Management.
The managers, who are all under 35, were divided into four teams at a
ceremony in Glasgow and each team was given four months to answer a
question of strategic importance to the Scottish economy.
These range from ''Is discrimination a dirty word?'' to ''Why don't
you train somebody?''
The winning team will be chosen in March by a judging panel headed by
Sandy Findlay (pictured above), executive chairman of plant hire firm
Hewden Stuart.
The competition aims to encourage personal development, networking and
managerial effectiveness among the participants, each of whom will
receive #100 worth of book tokens.

The Kremlin old guard in new clothes: Anne Simpson concludes the
series with a warning of the dangers when anarchy rules.
CORRUPTION, purges, executions, the boot of the Militia at dawn on the
stairs . . . such tyrannies employed against them by the highest never
reached the Russian people as the whole story, the honest story, or even
the main story. Instead they were doctored into meaningless news items
obscured in the party's small print. Meanwhile something
incomprehensible but close to the terrible truth was spread by the
murmur of a secret witness, or found in a historian's cryptic footnote,
long hidden in a drawer.
And then came glasnost in 1985, dynamiting the vaults which held the
horror tales and allowing the refusenik to shine. The Soviet media,
previously no more than a glum mouthpiece for Communist sermons, was
suddenly energised by investigative fervour, provoking, accusing,
denouncing, and embarking on intense discussion about how capitalism and
democracy might evolve into something more noble than in the West.
But in the 10 years since journalists and intellectuals were in the
vanguard of change much has been so shaken that there now exists no
social infrastructure at all. As a result, the gangster tycoon
flourishes as do the private-sector millionaires while the majority of
people suffer near penury, their diet consisting of what they can grow
and store.
So, has anything really altered? The Soviet Union always had its mafia
operating under cover of Communist bosses, ensuring everyone -- the
Militia, party officials, farm and factory workers -- was answerable to
its protection scams. And the Kremlin, too, always robbed the system,
mocking the comrades by stacking up the riches. The only obvious
difference now appears to be the noise of fury: Russia reverberates with
condemnation, crowds gathering daily in Moscow's Pushkin Square to shout
out the names of plundering billionaires and bureaucrats of cunning
greed.
The media, however, have largely lost their clout, silenced by bribery
or increasingly worried by signs that censorship may be renewed.
Amid the ferment caused by instability a familiar spectre is
re-emerging. Ever since the Chechen war sent Boris Yeltsin's popularity
into even deeper decline the Kremlin has become both paranoid and
increasingly authoritarian.
It justifies this on the grounds of Chechen terrorism in the capital
but many analysts believe that there is a return to old-style Soviet
politics with the President in the middle and four or five powerful
groups around him.
''We get hints of how it works,'' says Michael McFaul at the Moscow
office of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ''but we are
not privy to the inner workings in the way we were two or three years
ago''.
To Russians, and particularly to the committed journalists among them,
the pattern is eerily recognisable. ''It's a gradual restoration of the
former KGB but this time in new clothes,'' says an ex-member of the
security service, ''maybe not to its full omnipotence but in terms of
its structure and importance to Yeltsin's rule.''
Certainly at the heart of government there is a struggle between
vested interests, the chief of which are the raw-materials lobby and
industrial/military lobby.
The first, representing fuel, timber, and diamonds, and the ores which
are so plentiful in Russia, is Chernomyrdin's club. A recent recruit to
politics, he made his own fortune in Gazprom, a privatised company for
the extraction and distribution of gas. On Yeltsin's orders he recently
formed a Government party in the hope of dominating the parliamentary
elections in December, but already its slogan, Russia is our home, has
been derided and rendered Our home is Gazprom by the cynics.
The industrial/military lobby, on the other hand, seems rich only in
grievance, having suffered rapid contraction and no investment with the
loss of traditional markets for military exports, the one industry in
which the Soviet Union led the world. Well-clad now, in its London
tailoring and exhibiting the tastes and manners of international
sophisticates, the surviving KGB has kept tabs on the lot, causing the
present, uneasy power group to fear retribution and jail should it fall
from office.
If December's polls did bring a change of Government, these
politicians would immediately seek immunity from prosecution and, of
course, the freedom to hang on to their very serious money bolted away
in so many Western banks. But there are those who claim that the Kremlin
no longer cares about public opinion, either at home or abroad. Yevgenia
Albats, author of a book on the KGB, comments wearily that: ''the
tragedy is people here will accept this because everyone is so sickened
by politics''.
Even so, McFaul argues that if the elections, and presidential poll
next June, take place peaceably then it will be a giant leap forward in
stabilising a free society. ''December will be the first time the
bureaucrats put themselves up to be tested, and the people know they
have a choice. Unlike some Americans I don't believe Russians are
genetically programmed to reject democracy.''
But that might still be proved a minority view. Many analysts consider
that a new leadership would be furiously nationalistic and one goaded
on, this time, by the intelligentsia. ''Professors, doctors of science,
and the like, have not been adept at turning themselves into
entrepreneurs and they are now paid less than bus drivers,'' says one
political analyst. ''These were the very people who constructed
perestroika, but now they say that was a terrible mistake, and they
regard America as just another bandit from a rival kiosk.''
Does all this bode well for the fascist Zhirinovsky? Russian-watchers
believe the reverse, for by his own conspicuous rush to money and his
ugly addiction to throwing public punches the radical rightist is now
mostly dismissed as a pitiful clown. Interestingly it is the moderate
Communist leader, Gennadi Zynganov, who appears to offer most hope,
anticipating that from December's parliamentary race a broad coalition
will emerge, including ''all responsible'' factions rather than a
one-party dictatorship.
But Zynganov's devotion to pluralism remains untested, and while the
new elites and members of the old nomenklatura band together, or fight
to the death, in pursuit of capitalism, the rural communities, as ever,
reap a bitter harvest. In primitive markets and with clapped-out
machinery, the relatively small number of private farmers struggle to
pay their way while the drive to break up vast collective farms has
stalled. And, as livestock is drastically reduced, milk and meat
disappear from the Russian diet.
Affluent Muscovites, of course, shop at Tesco, housed in the former
KGB privilege store. There they purchase foreign groceries and good cuts
of foreign meat, but the poor rely on third-rate scraps from China, and
the world-war rations of bread and potatoes.
''Life has become a monster,'' says the father of a friend. This
cultivated and humorous man, just 60 and a former ambassador, is now
expected to live on a pension of $45 a month. All his savings have been
absorbed by medical treatment for his wife who, one year ago, suffered a
series of grave strokes.
There is pain and bewilderment in both their faces but today, at the
much-loved, old dacha, its floorboards creaking under the high jinks of
grandchildren, there is also a moment when the sadness of forbearance
lifts and you glimpse the Russian gift for bringing out of a store
cupboard the preserves of joy and candour, resilient irony and spiritual
hope which are still shared only among the intimately trusted.
We are in the garden, surrounded by birdsong, soaring birches and
pines, and in the distance there is the racket of pit bull terriers
guarding one of the hideous mansions built by a New Russian. ''This used
to be a place of small fences and neighbourliness,'' says the father,
''but now the rich surround themselves with a Kremlin wall, and
sometimes you even hear the crack of gunfire.''
On the table today there is a late summer feast -- onion soup,
barbecued lamb, shashlik, mixed salad, sweetmeats, wine and fragrant
tea. Each dish has been conjured up from nowhere by a different member
of the family, and in the course of the meal someone remarks that one of
the New Russian mansions has been built by a police chief who now finds
himself next door to a top dog in the mafia. There is laughter at the
thought of their protecting one another. A metaphor for modern Russia,
but an old joke all the same.
With its immense natural resources and well-educated population,
Russia is, in one sense, fabulously rich, and it isn't accurate any
longer to regard apathy as its narcotic. For all its disorder, Moscow is
exciting. Young people fizz with initiative and drive while, at the same
time, wanting to safeguard their tradition of learning and great
artistic heritage. But caught up in this spasm of shoot-outs, its
millions of decent citizens know that the anecdote recounted in the
forest is a reminder and a warning. Anarchy is not an effective
government, and some day its overthrow may drag the people back into old
Russia's other kind of malice and assault, that closed world drained of
freedom.

BALL clay producer Watts Blake Bearne is beginning to motor. Its
half-time pre-tax profits are up 19% to #6.11m due to expanding exports
from the UK and, more important, from Germany into Italy and Spain.
New technology means ceramic tiles need to be fired only once so
production costs have dropped, enabling exports back into Germany to
rise signifcantly.
WBB is the world's largest operator in this specialist sector and has
signed a joint-venture agreement with a Ukrainian company, further
tightening its grip on global supplies of high quality clay.
New chief executive Graham Lawson, who came from the borax division of
RTZ, expects the United Clays subsidiary in the US to increase
profitability thanks to management changes and later help consolidate
the industry there through acquisition -- it is already the largest
player.
Full-year profts should increase from #9.88m to about #12m, leaving
the shares of this unique company trading at 14 times likely earnings.
The snag is that Sibelco of Belgium has a 48.6% stake which it can
raise by 1% annually. But it is thought that even if it does gain
control, it will want to maintain the WBB Stock Exhange quotation.
The interim dividend has been raised 13% to 4.4p.

ALL judgments are difficult, that is why judges should be people of
the utmost probity and why it is all too easy to jeer at them.
Nevertheless judgments must be made and the condemnation of Britain by
the European Court of Human Rights over the Gibraltar shootings deserves
to be examined with honesty and in a mood of reflection. The MPs who
predictably spluttered yesterday about the desire of the British public
to give medals to the SAS men who killed the IRA terrorists were, as
usual, both close to the mark and very far from it. The British people
understand perfectly well, as did the judges in the Strasbourg court,
that the IRA members had travelled to Gibraltar with the intention of
setting off a large bomb which would kill many people. Their car bomb
was found later by Spanish police and it is self-evident that many
believe that those who take up bombs and guns cannot complain if they
die by them. Yet this is to miss the point of the judgment. The soldiers
involved were cleared by the judges who said that responsibility must
lie with their superiors, and thereby the Government, for failing to
prepare the operation properly and to ensure that the soldiers were
accurately informed.
Why the terrorists, if believed to be heavily armed, were allowed on
to a tightly-packed place like Gibraltar in the first place is
unanswered. Doubtless we will never know but, it is important now to
look ahead and in that respect two major problems are evident. The first
concerns the European Court of Human Rights which, by delivering such a
close decision and one which overturns an earlier ruling by the court's
own commission, finds itself in difficulties. The court has shown itself
to be divided on an important case. It may well be respected around the
world but its effectiveness and authority must be diminished by the
divisive nature of the vote on this particular issue.
The second problem concerns the attitude of the British Government. To
say that the judgment is incomprehensible and defies common sense is all
very well, but the underlying attitudes of some members of both the
Government and the Tory Party are disquieting and based partly on
ignorance. The court has nothing to do with the European Union but is an
arm of the European Union. Nor is it a European imposition, being based
on the European Human Rights Convention which Britain signed in 1951 and
in which Sir Winston Churchill placed great importance. Now we find that
certain Tories are angry about the convention on human rights and might
argue for withdrawal. Mr Heseltine, at his party-political worst
yesterday, would not rule that out and Mr Redwood, inevitably, has his
doubts. For Britain's sake and reputation, that must not happen.

IN his usual arrogant way Alex Salmond continually claims he beat
George Robertson in the so-called great debate on devolution (September
26). That is not the view of people who spoke to me about it. They felt
that, while Salmond was certainly the master of the slick phrase, George
Robertson won the argument hands down.
No doubt Alex Salmond thinks that if he claims it often enough people
will begin to believe he really was the winner.

I WAS interested in the powerful case made by James Hunter, in his
John McEwen Memorial Lecture, for the implementation of the proposals
made by the Crofters Commission in 1968 for the wholesale conversion of
crofting tenure to owner-occupancy with the common grazings passing into
the hands of trustees on behalf of crofters (September 22).
It was a matter of great regret to me and my colleagues on the
commission that neither the Conservative nor the Labour Governments of
the period were prepared to implement the proposals, in spite of the
massive support they had from crofters.
Before submitting formal proposals to Government the commission tried
to democratise the toothless Crofting Act of 1955. The Act empowered the
commission to appoint crofters as assessors to advise on local issues
but we took the view that crofters hand-picked by the commission lacked
authority, however estimable they might be as individuals.
We stood the Act on its head, invited the grazings committees to
nominate their own representatives, and then complied with the Act by
formally appointing them as our assessors.
In this way we knew the proposals had the solid backing of more than
100 of the crofters' chosen leaders. Today the support from crofters
would be even greater.
The 1968 proposals were not made in emulation of Ireland. We came to
the problem by an entirely different route. In 1968, with the Highlands
and Islands Development Board in place, new opportunities were opening
up for development in tourism and other activities.
Crofters had a statutory right to engage in such activities but,
without the protection of ownership, they could only safely do so with
the landlord's consent and at the landlord's price. The 1976 Crofting
Reform Act removed some of these anomalies but left the job half done.
The Irish studies which I carried out with the late Donald MacCuish,
the commission's secretary and legal adviser, and principal architect of
the 1968 proposals, were directed to finding out whether the Irish
legislation contained any mistakes which we should avoid.
We learned that great difficulties had arisen from the Irish
legislation because shareholders in common grazings became pro indiviso
proprietors, all of whom had to be consulted -- even if they had
emigrated or disappeared -- before significant changes could be made.
It is possible to argue for or against communal ownership of the
common grazings on social and practical grounds but the legal lesson
from the Irish experience is imperative.
I wish Jim Hunter well in his new crusade.

THE proposal of the governor of Hong Kong that the Hong Kong Chinese
should be given rights of residence in the UK may absolve him from blame
for an act of great wickedness.
To have kept the Hong Kong Chinese community in colonial subjection
for 156 years only to hand them over, without consent, to the
ideological tyranny and inevitable physical oppression of the Chinese
communists is a gross violation of their human rights.
We know that on and from July 1, 1997 the communist Chinese will do
what they choose with the Hong Kong Chinese including the dispersal of
perceived dissidents to Labour camps throughout China for indoctrination
and elimination.
To pretend that this will not happen is British hypocrisy at its
worst.

I AM amazed by the use of emotionally overloaded and biased language
in coverage of the Bosnian conflict.
That there is a double standard is obvious from the testament of the
different sides. The term ''ethnic cleansing'' is used exclusively to
describe the actions of the Serbs.
In the recent Croat/Bosnian Muslim offensive they are said to be
''liberating'' land when in reality there is no difference between this
and ''ethnic cleansing''.
This also suggests that the Serbs are occupiers being driven back as
opposed to occupants being driven from their homes.
The effect of this language is to demonise the Serbs, and the
portrayal of the conflict in black and white prevents understanding of
what is really going on.

WILLIAM Docherty wrote that Ian Bell and Ruth Wishart ''peer at the
human condition through the cataract of secularism . . . '' which,
according to him means that these journalists ''promote individualism''
and ''undermine human solidarity'' (September 23).
In the same issue, T M Riddell wrote that it was necessary ''to
confront the propagation powers of self-sufficiency by a combined
campaign of all the elements of Christ's Church''.
As a secular humanist I can only say that I believe in the essential
interdependence of human beings and I do not regard humanism as a
licence to adopt a selfish and hedonistic life stance.
People who believe that their faith is ''the one true faith'' and who
confine their search for truth to a single source are much more likely
to cause divisions in society than are people who believe that mankind
must solve its problems without relying on divine intervention.
If we are ever to build a truly multiracial and multicultural society,
people will have to be free to adhere to any faith or none, and the
common bonds of citizenship will lie in the secular area.

DAVID Dimbleby has apparently inherited the instincts of a member of
the English establishment -- close ranks and put a frightener on the
peasantry as a first move when his interests are threatened (September
22).
He is probably right when he says that Scots independence is not on
the agenda south of the Border, for the English electorate needed four
elections and 15 years to discover what a terrible mistake they made
with Thatcher.
He fails, however, to take into account the English Tory MPs who have
a well-earned reputation for avarice and ruthlessness and who are at
present, having sold almost everything including the family silver,
scrabbling around at the bottom of the barrel desperately seeking the
next tax sweetener with which to bribe the electorate.
Is it not beyond belief that Scotland is being subsidised by #4
billion or #8 billion or 16%, or whatever the latest guess may be, but
these honourable gentlemen are not baying for Scottish independence?
We should not forget the comparable examples of Denmark and Finland,
and most of all Norway, which is also a small nation with a (carefully
husbanded) oil resource.
If it is true that the Scots need subsidising, as they have no control
over their own affairs then this can only be attributed to Westminster
mismanagement and exploitation.
In short, as Mr Swinney of the SNP has said, the Scots can't afford to
stay in the Union.

TAKING part in a recent conference in Aberdeen with the theme of ''The
future ain't what it used to be'' gave me cause to think more about how
we plan ahead.
It is something we all do, despite the urgent always having to take
precedence over the merely important.
Methods vary -- some people make more time for planning and do it in a
very structured way; some use the back of an envelope; others still do
it more instinctively. All approaches have their attractions, depending
on the type of organisation and the environment involved.
All require us to make assumptions about the future. However, the
increasing speed at which things happen, the growing impact of events in
other parts of the globe and ever more startling leaps in technology
mean the future certainly ain't what it used to be; it is much more
uncertain.
As a result we need to become a bit more sophisticated in the way we
think about and plan for the future. This doesn't mean looking for even
more accurate ways of prediction. As one astute strategic planner once
put it: ''He who lives by the crystal ball soon learns to eat ground
glass.'' But it does mean being able to consider a variety of ''what
ifs''.
It requires the flexibility and open-mindedness to be able to consider
the possibility of certain events taking place and the ability to react
rapidly if and when they do. The ability to respond appropriately and
speedily will give significant competitive advantage.
So what has all of this got to do with Europe? You are probably tired
of people like me telling you that the European Union is an increasingly
important factor in all our lives -- I'm sorry, but it is.
Consider the following. More than 50% of Scotland's exports go to
other EU countries; EU membership is critical to our success in
attracting inward investment, and the EU spends in excess of #500m a
year in Scotland on areas such as regional and agricultural support.
Thus the plans of all organisations in Scotland will be increasingly
affected by the European Union and its development. For some this will
be at a macro level, while for others it will involve issues specific to
individual sectors.
Over the next few months I plan to use this column to explore some of
the broader ''what ifs'' concerning the EU and the business world. My
aim is to help in preparing for the future, not to pass judgment about
whether certain issues are good or bad.
I will try to draw attention to the possibility that some things may
happen and maybe offer an opinion as to how likely they are. I will,
however, keep in mind that a mouthful of ground glass is to be avoided.
At a broad level, the future of the European Union involves questions
about its further integration and expansion -- in the popular shorthand
of Brussels, its depth and width. Will the EU become deeper and/or
wider, and if it doesn't develop far or fast in either direction, can it
tread water? In particular, I will look at how the following issues
evolve and how they will affect business in Scotland:
* The future of economic and monetary union -- Will the planned single
currency come to pass? If so, when? How many countries will participate?
What effect will this have on the single market? How will this affect
our ability to export to the rest of Europe and attract inward
investment?
* The review of the Maastricht Treaty in 1996 -- What are the options?
Will member states agree to an increase in the areas for common EU
policies, for example energy and tourism?
Will there be more decisions taken by a majority vote in the Council
of Ministers, or will unanimity among members still predominate? Will
the parliament be given more powers? How could changes in the way the EU
organises itself affect the business environment in Scotland?
* The expansion of the EU to eastern, central and southern Europe --
How many members will the EU have early next century -- 15, 20, 25?
Which countries will be involved? Will they include, say, Poland,
Hungary, Romania or Cyprus? What is a likely timetable? What conditions
will existing members demand? What effect will it have on regional
policy?
What effect will it have on the Common Agricultural Policy? What about
trade and investment flows? And the competitiveness of Scottish
companies?
This analysis won't make accurately predicting the future any easier.
However, I hope it will help in planning how to cope with the various
scenarios that involvement in the European Union might throw at business
in Scotland.

WHAT patently absurd nonsense Norman Hogg, the incredibly pompous
Labour MP for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, consistently talks in his
increasingly desperate efforts to discredit the SNP (September 25).
''The first requirement of nationalism,'' he sonorously intones, ''is
a definition of who qualifies to be a citizen.'' Strangely enough, this
is also the first constitutional requirement of any genuine liberal
democracy anywhere else in the world.
Time and again the SNP has made it crystal-clear that we are not
interested in an exclusively ethnic -- or even cultural -- definition of
Scottish nationality but solely in an essentially political or civic
definition.
Mr Hogg may sleep easy in the knowledge that the right to vote in an
independent Scotland would be automatically accorded to every adult
resident regardless of racial or national origin who is not disqualified
by any of the existing statutory disqualifications.
In this respect the SNP's criteria for Scottish citizenship are in all
probability no different from the criteria for participation in
elections to the proposed devolved Scottish parliament, as already
approved, presumably, by the Scottish Labour Party as well as by their
Liberal Democrat allies in the Constitutional Convention.
Mr Hogg is, however, right about one thing. Scottish Nationalism is
indeed a dangerous development -- at least for him. It might well cost
him his Westminster seat at the next General Election.

THERE are growing hopes that restrictions on the export of live cattle
could be lifted next year as the number of BSE cases in Britain
continues to drop dramatically.
It could give a major boost worth millions of pounds to the beef
cattle trade in the south of Scotland over the next few years.
The number of new cases of BSE in Scotland over the past two years has
shown big falls and there are signs that the German cattle industry is
keen to see the export market opened up again.
The epidemic which swept the country over the past decade led to the
loss of millions pounds in export trade, especially for the Galloway and
Highland breeds where hundreds were shipped to Germany in the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
Galloway cattle exports alone to German and other European countries
were worth more than #5m in the 1980s and early nineties as more than
5000 head were purchased and shipped abroad.
Last year the number of new BSE cases in Scotland was down by 40% to
1694 compared with 2736 in 1993 and the trend this year has continued
downwards.
In December the EC Standing Veterinary Committee acknowledged the
continuing improvement by lifting the requirement for six years' freedom
from BSE on the farm for animals born after January 1, 1992.
Now German agricultural authorities are looking for exports to be
restarted next year as the panic over the BSE problem reduces and there
is general acknowledgment that the ban on feeding ruminants meat and
bone meal has worked.
Norman Wintner, divisional veterinary officer with the Department of
Agriculture at Dumfries, said the drop in Dumfries and Galloway had been
significant. ''The epidemic in this area peaked in 1993 when there were
638 confirmed cases,'' he said. ''The following year there was a 42%
reduction and up to June this year there were 119 cases investigated
which is 47% of the number reported in the same period last year. The
number in beef cattle breeds has been very small with most of the cases
in dairy cattle.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said the epidemic had been two
years later in taking off in Scotland and was now running its course.
* DAIRY farmers in South-west Scotland have been invited to a meeting
tonight by Milk Marque who are hoping to recruit producers north of the
Border. They have no Scottish farmers on contract at present but do sell
milk in bulk in Scotland and have empty tankers returning south.

SCOTLAND is no longer a Christian nation, indeed probably hasn't been
one for a very long time. That statement will be seized upon with
perverse delight by those who have faith but are possessed with feelings
of doom about its prospects, and with genuine delight by atheists who
are as bad as the worst sort of nationalists when it comes to requiring
the face of an enemy to grind into the dust. Nevertheless, it is still
true. To justify it is to indulge in definitions and only the most
general are usefully applicable here. A person who assents to the claims
of the Christian faith (the real ones, and not just the ones the man in
the street thinks apply) and who is involved in the life and worship of
a church is a Christian. The person who lives a good and decent life,
who attends the great religious rites of passage (birth, marriage and
death with the odd Communion service flung in) and who does not beat his
wife, children or dog is not a Christian. That is the large majority of
the Scottish people and to surprising numbers of them it will be the
greatest shock to be told that they are not Christians.
This is the fault of the Church of whatever denomination. They all
have basically the same rules but they have all failed to make clear to
their public, inside the church walls and outside, what it means to be a
Christian. It has all become soft, hazy, socially worthy, flowery-hatted
and intellectually flaccid. That is just one side of the Church. For the
other side it has become happy (as in fixed-grin), clappy, youthful,
''relevant'' and intellectually vapid. In between, there are bastions of
muscular faith and honesty. It need not be like this, for the truth
about real church allegiance could be liberating. Like alcoholics, the
Christian churches must be honest about their position before they can
start to build once more.

MURRAY Split Capital Trust's underweight positions in the buoyant
banking and pharmaceuticals sectors were partly responsible for its
under-performance during the 12 months to end-August.
Net assets edged up 1.8%, from #25.6m to #26.1m, while the Kleinwort
Benson TOPSI 100 index of higher yielding shares rose 3.2% and the
All-Share index advanced 5.7%.
The dividend was raised for the first time since the Glasgow-based
trust's launch in July 1991, with excellent dividend growth in the UK
market and healthy revenue reserves cited as the reasons.
Murray Split's total payout is 2.4% higher at 10.85p, after a final
dividend of 2.9p.
Holders of capital shares, the net asset value of which declined by
4.6% to 213.5p, obviously bore the brunt of the under-performance. Net
asset value per income share was unchanged at 51.6p, with nav per
zero-dividend Preference share up the usual 11.4% at 155.9p.
The Murray Johnstone-managed trust's overweight position in
medium-sized companies, which benefited performance in the previous 12
months, went against the fund in the year to August.
Since January, the trust has been reducing its exposure to early
cyclical stocks, selling holdings in ICI, English China Clays, GKN and
Smiths Industries.
Believing the market has taken an overly pessimistic view of consumer
dependent stocks, it has bought Allied Domecq, House of Fraser and
Kingfisher.

BAILLIE Gifford Japan Trust was hit by the Kobe earthquake and the
strong yen during the year to August 31.
Net asset value (nav) fell 11.6% to 678.4p per share, closely
following an 11.7% fall in the Tokyo stock exchange index of leading
shares in sterling terms, but out-performing a 23.8% fall in Japanese
second-line stocks.
''We have obviously had a relatively good year, even though the market
as a whole is down,'' said fund manager George Veitch.
About 40% of the #74.6m trust was hedged against a fall in the yen and
this softened the impact of the currency's recent nosedive.
But nav continued to decline during September, hitting 653.6p
yesterday as the yen's plunge outweighed gains on the Tokyo stock
exchange.
The Baillie Gifford Japan Trust was geared up to 9% in early August
with a 12-month loan of around one billion yen.
Mr Veitch said most of the money had already been invested, with the
trust sticking to its preference for medium-sized firms in the
electronics, hi-tech and miscellaneous manufacturing sectors.
It remains underweight in the troubled financial sector, he added.
Earnings per share declined to 3.41p from 3.54p, but as usual it paid
no dividend.
Dividend yields in Japan are traditionally low at around 0.7% to 0.8%
so all Japanese investment trusts concentrate on capital growth instead.

A POOR response to yesterday's #3000m gilts auction, which knocked
more than a point off Government stocks, was the major factor in the
second sharp fall in the stock market in less than a week. (Friday's
relapse was largely blamed on currency turbulence).
A 38.3 drop in the FTSE-100 share index to 3485.0 left the market
nervously poised below 3500 for only the second time since August 18.
The auction was covered 0.99 times, the first time City pundits could
remember one being underfunded. The City had expected this month's
auction to be covered between 1.5 and 2.0 times.
But it is clear that institutional investors do not like what is
happened to the public finances. With five months of the fiscal year
gone there is little sign of any improvement and the Treasury's own
forecast of sharp reduction in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
this year may end up a piece of wishful thinking.
Revenues have simply not been matching official projections, largely
because of the slowdown in economic activity, particularly in the retail
sector.
Already the Bank of England has been forced to step up its financing
programme to fill the gap, but institutional appetites have been
dampened by the inevitable pre-Budget speculation on the extent of any
politically motivated tax cuts in November's Budget.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, is adopting a
cautious tone and may even consider a populist windfall tax on utilities
to help him out of his difficulties.
Increasingly it looks, however, as if his hands are tied behind his
back. Not only are the public finances failing to respond fully to the
drastic surgery of previous Budgets, but sterling too is coming under
pressure again as the dollar retreats from its summer highs against the
Japanese yen and the German mark.
The foreign exchange markets also reacted adversely to the weak demand
in the gilts auction. The trade weighted index ended the afternoon 0.5
point lower at 84.2, leaving it worth nearly 5% less than it had been at
the start of the year.
But it would be a mistake to become too sanguine about the prospects
for the UK equity market. Interest rates look like peaking at a much
lower level than had been feared earlier because of the slowdown in
activity, though this will also act as a restraint on corporate
earnings.
At current levels the UK market offers much better value for money
than its international competitors, most of which also took a battering
yesterday, and the gap between the Footsie and the Dow Jones in New York
is historically high.
Data needed
SCOTTISH Enterprise chose a new art gallery in Leith yesterday to
launch what could be a valuable addition to the scant data we currently
have on the performance of the Scottish economy.
Could be. But the picture painted yesterday of Scotland's booming
business birth rate has a half-finished, but heavily-varnished look
about it.
There's no point boasting that Scotland's four clearing banks opened
more than 11,000 new business accounts in the first six months of this
year unless we get some equivalent hard data about how many accounts
were closed in the same period.
If more people are being forced out of business than are taking the
plunge, the Scottish economy is going backwards. To be fair to it,
Scottish Enterprise recognised that when it first set its millennial
business birth rate target at 25,000 more businesses than existed when
the initiative was launched.
The problem, we are told, is getting the banks to agree a meaningful
measure of company death rates. Some business accounts can lie dormant
for years after a business has effectively ceased trading. Then there's
the category of ''bad and doubtful'' accounts. But are those the banks
place in intensive care heading for the recovery room or the morgue?
''It may sound as if we are being very defensive. But we want to give
you a meaningful figure'', said the clearing banks' spokesman Alan
Scott. Mr Scott also cited the different computer regimes in each of the
banks for the failure to agree when the last nail has been hammered into
each corporate coffin.
He told us that, currently, business births exceed business deaths by
a significant margin. And, as trusting folk, we believe him. But if the
new data is to occuply a respected place in charting the path of the
Scottish economy, we need to see the other half of the picture painted .
. . in clear and unambiguous numbers.
Midas touch
CAMELOT is justifiably proud of its success in making the National
Lottery such a major money spinner for Good Causes and the Treasury.
That organisation benefits from both its 12% levy and, more subtly, also
not having to pay out for national treasures such as the Churchill
papers.
With sales in excess of #3700m annually, Camelot is legally entitled
to a post-tax return of up to 1% or about #75m annually at the pre-tax
level.
That augers well for the shareholders, particularly Cadbury Schweppes
which has a 22.5% stake and so can look forward to perhaps around #17m
of associate company income and nearly as much as that in cash dividends
as Camelot will see a sharp fall in future capital expenditures with
little need for retentions. It has effectively reached maturity with the
future addition of another 10,000 shop outlets to raise the total to
more than 35,000 not that heavy a financial burden.
Cadbury has, therefore, more than compensated itself for any drop in
income from confectionery and soft drinks while software and systems
specialist GTech will also receive a similar income flow as well as
about #20m of annual royalty fees.
But sadly for them, the franchise runs out in 2002 unless renewed and
so a flotation is in practice out of the question. However, it would
require a major upset for the franchise not to be retained and so
Camelot could achieve near utility status in City terms. Playing the
lottery is entirely voluntary so there can be no complaint about the
level of profitability unlike the privatised utilities where there is no
choice.

NATIONAL LOTTERY
NATIONAL Lottery organiser Camelot has the size of the weekly jackpot
under review but seems unlikely to alter the prize distribution soon.
There have been many calls to reduce the payout, perhaps in line with
the football pools which rarely pay out much more than #2m to a single
winner.
However, in Holland, Sweden, and one Canadian province where the prize
was capped, there was a sharp drop in sales and the limit was
subsequently removed.
In practice, the average jackpot is #750,000 with 20% of the winning
numbers held by syndicates which are currently out-performing individual
participants in the share of prizes.
Camelot chief executive Tim Holley said yesterday that sales of the
main lottery had settled to a remarkably consistent pattern. About 50%
take place on a Saturday and run at about #64m weekly with an
approximate #1m variation.
But when there is a roll-over of the prize money, sales rise by
between 15% and 20%. In contrast, sales of the instants or scratch cards
have peaked. They did reach #44m but have since fallen back to about
#26m and this will most likely prove the more difficult sector in which
to maintain momentum.
Annualised lottery sales are running at about #5500m and Mr Holley
does not expect them to expand significantly in future.
Although Camelot, which is owned by a shareholder consortium
comprising Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue, ICL, Racal and GTech of
America, has no say in how the money is distributed, it is believed to
be concerned at the way some awards have been made -- particularly the
#12m for the Churchill papers and the near #70m eventual distribution to
the Royal Opera House.
Socio-economic groups AB -- which constitute 20% of the population --
buy 17% of the mainline tickets. But it is feared they will prove much
more sensitive than others to how the money is distributed.

CONSTRUCTION
BOARDROOM changes at the troubled Costain Group -- including chief
executive Peter Costain stepping down to become non-executive deputy
chairman -- and reduced half-year operating losses from #15.1m to #5.9m,
cut no ice with the market where the shares fell 9p to 69p.
Alan Lovell steps up from finance director to become the new chief
executive and three new executive directors have been appointed.
Management action taken in the US to reduce costs and increase
productivity, including substantial job reductions, has returned the
coal operations to a profit of #700,000 after a loss of #16.9m for the
same period last year. By the end of 1994, losses in the US operation
had grown to #182m. However, the company is predicting rising profits
and positive cashflow in the future.
In engineering and construction, Costain was in the red by #3.7m in
the first half after last year's profit of #4.6m, hit by business
development costs.
This was after the release of #2.5m of the #15m provision made against
the Channel Tunnel contract which the board regarded as justified.
Eurotunnel's recent claim against the TML consortium ''simply signals
the extent of Eurotunnel's desperation and, if pursued, will be rejected
and met with substantial counter-claims against Eurotunnel,'' Costain
said.
Chairman Sir Christopher Benson is able to point to an 11% increase in
the engineering and construction orderbook to #529m at the year-end. And
the performance should improve in the second half, though the timing and
settlement of major accounts will be a major factor.
Generally, business remains extremely competitive around the world and
Costain is again passing the dividend.

A HUGE shake-up in management responsibilities at Scottish Amicable
has resulted in Mike Smith resigning as general manager for operations
by ''mutual consent''.
This follows the shock announcement on Monday that investment chief
Graeme Knox was leaving SAIM, the investment management subsidiary, and
also resigning as a director of the life company.
Mr Smith is being succeeded by Jim Mitchell, who moves from heading
corporate services, and is in turn followed by Jim Martin who is in
charge of human resources.
In a formal statement, ScotAm managing director Roy Nicolson said that
in terms of service the benefits of the new approach had taken longer
than expected to emerge. Accordingly, it was felt necessary to make a
number of management changes.
No-one was available for comment at ScotAm last night.

<HEADLINE>Construction firm set for market capitalisation of #77m. Morrison floats shares at 115p</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MORRISON Construction Group yesterday priced its shares at 115p each,
giving the Edinburgh-based company a market capitalisation of #77m at
flotation.
The timing of the announcement was unfortunate since it coincided with
a clutch of downbeat trading forecasts from other leading companies in
the construction sector -- Tarmac, Costain and Beazer.
But Morrison has a wide spread of activities and an aggressive
approach to seeking new contracts and it is confident of maintaining its
strong performance to date.
The company has raised #20m net of expenses through a placing with a
wide range of institutions which include Standard Life, Prudential
Assurance and fund manager Gartmore.
''A sufficient number of opportunities are currently being pursued to
generate projects in which the new capital can be profitably invested
within 12 months without increasing the overall risk profile of the
group,'' said chairman Fraser Morrison.
Bill McCall, an analyst with broker Tilney in Edinburgh, described the
strike price of 115p as ''fair''.
''Times are hard in the building sector, but Morrison has managed to
carve out quite a profitable niche,'' he said.
Morrison has steered clear of speculative developments which have
proved the downfall of many other construction companies, and Mr McCall
noted approvingly that it often cuts the cost of tendering by forming
joint ventures.
The #20m of new shares placed with institutions and a further #5m
being sold by the company's present owners will begin trading on the
Stock Exchange on October 6.
Following the flotation, the directors of Morrison, their families and
associated trusts will hold 61.8% of the company's issued shares.
Morrison has forecast a pre-tax profit of #3.1m for the six months to
September 30 -- more than double the #1.5m achieved in the first half of
last year.
But finance director Keith Howell cautioned that its historical
tendency to make most of its profits in the second half of the year
would be less pronounced than usual.
''We expect the bias towards greater profits in the second half to
continue, but it will not be as pronounced as last year,'' he said.
Morrison made a pre-tax profit of #7.6m in 1994-95 on turnover of
#218.4m.
There was no dividend forecast, but the company said in its flotation
prospectus that it would have expected to pay a dividend of 4.26p per
share for the year to March 31, when earnings per share totalled 10.22p.
This gives the shares a theoretical yield of 4.6%.
Mr Howell said the group's development teams, which scour the UK
looking for business opportunities before tender documents are
published, had identified about 30 new projects to follow up.
These range from pre-funded projects such as the new building for
Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary to design, build and operate schemes for
roads in southern England.
Morrison would not charge motorists tolls for using such roads, but
would receive ''shadow toll'' payments from the Government, indexed to
traffic levels after completion.
Other projects in the pipeline include a series of design, build and
operate water and sewage projects in Scotland.
These illustrate Morrison's joint-venture approach. It has teamed up
with North West Water and the US engineering giant Bechtel to bid for
the contracts.
The group's aggressive methods of hunting for new business recently
led to charges that it had received a head start in bidding for the
headquarters for the future North of Scotland Water Authority in
Inverness.
The Herald reported last month that Morrison had been given
specifications for the #2m building and had lodged a planning
application for it before other potential bidders had received the
details.
However, a Scottish Office inquiry cleared the company of any
wrongdoing.
Morrison is active in four main areas -- building and property
development, civil engineering, utilities and energy, and house
building.
Most of its business is in the UK, but it has a growing presence in
Kuwait, Russia, Azerbaijan and Germany.
The company was founded in Tain in 1948 by Alexander Morrison, the
father of the present chairman.
In 1974 an 80% stake was sold to Consolidated African Selection Trust.
The firm then passed through the hands of several owners before Fraser
Morrison and his younger brother Gordon bought back control in 1989.

IT seems extraordinary that, without a ceasefire and with fighting
raging, the combatants in Bosnia have managed to reach some sort of
agreement on a document which seeks to define the future constitutional
arrangements for the country. The talks in New York, brokered and driven
by the United States, are a triumph of hope and determination. Their
arrangements may be full of problems and without guarantees that
anything agreed will actually take place but, as Warren Christopher said
wisely, they represent an important point psychologically. That said,
the agreement will be exceedingly difficult to implement. It hinges on
the determination of the Bosnian Muslims in particular that Bosnia
should remain as an independent and centrally governed state comprising
Bosnian Muslim, Croat and Bosnian Serb regions. The Bosnian Serbs are
just as determined that the authority of central government shall be
minimal, thus preserving much of the power of their own ethnic Serb
region. This is not a recipe for future peace, and its problems are
compounded by the extreme complexity of the agreed power-sharing
formula.
Both future parliament and presidency are divided into the obvious
three groups. The trick is to devise a system which will give each some
power but prevent one group halting all legislation. The fact that all
three parties have agreed to the formula suggests that there are
expectations that it will work, but it will be difficult. In effect just
one group, if it objects to a policy, can bring government to a halt and
though we hope devoutly that the agreement will prove effective there
must be doubts. Mr Clinton, however, is pleased. With Mr Perot muddying
political waters and confusing the right, a foreign policy success is
that much more important to his re-election hopes. Now he has two,
though of the two the Middle East is likely to prove more durable.

IF Christian statues can weep what's wrong with Hindu statues
drinking? But why milk? Why not a good swally, like an 18-year-old malt.
Religious statues seem twee in their manifestations. Milk has a gentle
image. The milk of human kindness and all that, though this is cow's
milk they're swallyin', and weeping signifies sorrow or sympathy.
But there must be times when the Deity gets cheesed off with antics
that deserve something more condemnatory than tears or milk. He could
make a statue urinate as a sign of his contempt for the fleshpot
materialism so rampant in today's world.
Maybe He has and it was hidden by respectable adherents because
statues are not supposed to pee in public, and anyway a urinating statue
has less box-office appeal than one that weeps. Such believers would
turn God into a kind of candy-floss celestial impresario. A mixture of
Mary Poppins and Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Such a god would be a dead loss. I prefer the Christ who stormed the
temple and couped over the tables of the money changers. He wasn't
respectable, kept the company of publicans, befriended a lady of the
night, and would have been more at home in the company of Rab Nesbitt
than He would the average Kirk elder. He was also a subversive to boot.
Why should God do tricks to sustain the faith of the faithful? What
kind of faith needs buttressing by having Him act like a cosmic Paul
Daniels? What evidence is there that He ever did? The case for divinely
inspired healing places is not helped by the fact that there is no
record of anyone going into these places with one leg and coming out
with two.
In the New Testament we read of a man beseeching Christ: ''Look upon
my son . . . And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out;
and it teareth him that he foameth again . . . And Jesus said . . .
bring thy son hither . . . And as he was a coming the Devil threw him
down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the
child, and delivered him again to his father.'' This affliction the
youngster suffered from we now know as epilepsy.
Contrast this with Hippocrates writing 400 years BC about the same
illness: ''Men regard its origins as divine from ignorance and wonder,
since it is a peculiar condition and not readily understood. Surely then
this disease has its physic and causes whence it originates, even as
have other diseases, and it is curable by means comparable to their cure
. . . Such things are divine or not -- as you will, for the distinction
matters not -- nor is there need to make this distinction anywhere in
nature, for have not all a physic which can be found by those who seek
it steadfastly?''
There is no proof of the veracity of biblical miracles unless you
believe in the absolute literal truth of all that is written in the good
book, which means we would have to rewrite the physical history of the
planet, for Earth would then be only a few thousand years old, and not
the millions of geological science.
Mainstream Christianity believes in the allegorical and not the
literal truth of the Bible. Jesus Christ did exist. He was just over
5ft, dark, and slightly stooped, yet we've got Him looking like a young
Peter O'Toole with the disposition of a delegate to a Liberal Democrat
conference.
Jesus was a member of a Jewish sect, the Essenes, who lived in highly
organised groups and held all property in common. The message Christ
preached in the Sermon on the Mount was Essenian. His belief that we
were all children of the same heavenly Father was a revolutionary
doctrine in the context of the Roman Empire, based on slavery.
Jesus Christ must have been an outstanding preacher. His message comes
powerfully down through the ages and is more relevant today than ever
before. For Him it was how you treated others that mattered: ''What you
did unto the least . . . you did unto me.''
Try judging our political masters by this standard. What have they
done unto the poor, the mentally sick, the weak and defenceless except
make them poorer, sicker, weaker and more defenceless?
I find it impossible to believe in a supreme being who made the world
and invented phlegm. But I know why believers believe and sometimes wish
I could too. If some believe their statues are getting tore into milk,
then so be it. If I ha'e doots, then so be it, but we can agree that
children everywhere should get the milk they need.
Believers and non-believers, might not agree about heaven, but we can
agree not to make Earth a hell. No messiah will save the environment,
that our greed endangers. No saviour will save our economy and give it
moral purpose. We have to do it for ourselves.
In the film Viva Zapata! Marlon Brando playing the peasant leader who
became President is resigning because he fears that power is corrupting.
His lieutenant tells him, ''Our people need a strong leader'', and
Zapata replies, ''Only a weak people need a strong leader, our people
must learn to be strong''. That is true of all peoples. And ''strong
leader'' is a euphemism for actual or apprentice despots. From Herod to
Maggie.
Every time I board an aircraft I wonder. Flying tenements. For humans
who lived in past centuries such a phenomenon would be a miracle to
surpass anything. Maybe God gave us the capacity to work these miracles,
but we have to make them work for the good of everyone. Here the words
of Christ come into play. ''What you do unto the least of men you do
unto me,'' and me, and you.

BEAZER Homes had plenty to be pleased about in the year to June, but
since then it has joined the general mass of housebuilders in talking
about reservation falls of up to 15%. Only Barratt seems to defy gravity
in the sector, achieving a 6% gain in the last two or three months.
The historic figures show pre-tax profits up from #33.9m in the nine
months to June 1994 to #55.7m with an underlying advance of about 23%.
The company which was floated off by Hanson in March 1994 at 165p
achieved a record 6679 completions, raising overall market share from
3.6% to 4.2%. That showed the impact of the acquisition of both Walker
Homes and John Mowlem Homes.
As these brought in a substantial number of partnership or social
housing units, Beazer saw overall group selling prices ease marginally
to #61,900, although open market sales were 3.5% better at #67,300.
Chief executive Dennis Webb is expecting something in excess of
#70,000 in the current year as the number of social units falls off
sharply.
The build in Scotland rose by 52% to 1032 units, taking market share
up by half to 7.4% helped by Walker doubling its contribution to 326
houses.
The toughest area was North-east England, although Mr Webb wants to
expand there and seems quite happy to acquire assets from conglomerates
wanting to quit housebuilding.
He has been optimistically building up the land bank despite expecting
margins in the current year to fall from 13.9% to about 12% as he has to
raise the discount to buyers.
The dividend total has been raised 8.3% to 5.85p to put the shares at
145p on a 5% yield.

NEW BUSINESSES
SCOTTISH Enterprise claims Scotland's business birth rate is booming,
citing new statistics prepared in association with the country's four
clearing banks.
The figures suggest that 5677 new businesses were created in the first
three months of this year, and a further 5353 in the second quarter.
The businesses were predominantly in the general services, retail and
catering sectors, which together accounted for 82% of all new business
in the first quarter and 83% in the second.
The totals are based on people opening new business accounts with the
four Scottish banks -- Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland,
Clydesdale and TSB -- during the periods and are modified to take
account of anyone moving from bank to bank or opening multiple accounts
for a single business.
They span everything from sole traders to limited companies, but
exclude new businesses banking with non-Scottish banks or with building
societies. Despite that, the authors claim their figures, which are
validated by the University of Edinburgh, account for some 96% of all
business accounts opened.
The figures are broken down into nine regions, with Glasgow and the
South-west showing 2098 business starts in quarter one and 1861 in
quarter two. Starts in the Edinburgh, Lothian and Borders region jumped
from 961 in the first three months to 1268 in the April-June period.
The biggest surprise from the regional breakdown is that the North,
which covers the Highlands, recorded 681 starts in the first quarter but
only 279 in the second. The regions used reflect banking structures, not
local government areas.
The new statistical series, which will be published quarterly from now
on, is designed to give a more comprehensive ongoing picture of
Scotland's business birth rate than has been available up to now from
VAT or Companies House registrations.
The new barometer, as SE's business development director Russel Griggs
calls it, is needed if the enterprise network is to measure progress
towards its target of increasing the rate of new business creation by
50% by the year 2000.
But, since that objective implies creating 25,000 net additional new
businesses by the end of the century, the figures released yesterday
cover only half the story. So far the four banks have been unable to
agree on a common measure of the death rate among Scottish companies,
represented by the closure of accounts.
Mr Griggs is hopeful that agreed closure figures will be available
from next year, allowing the new index to reflect the net (births minus
deaths) picture. But, at the launch of the new statistical series in
Leith yesterday, Alan Scott, secretary of the Committee of Scottish
Clearing Banks, was more non-committal.
He did, however, insist that the death rate among Scottish businesses
was currently ''significantly lower'' than the birth rate.

DESPITE being hailed as the great British white hope in the jazz
world, Glaswegian Carol Kidd says: ''I don't really see myself as a jazz
singer.'' She just likes to sing, and she just happens to do it
phenomenally well.
A more apt job description would be balladeer, since it is the slower,
more romantic and personal numbers which best showcase the Kidd voice; a
voice which won her the gig of a lifetime -- opening the 1990 Ibrox
concert by one of her idols, Frank Sinatra.
Kidd is not really a jazz fan either. Ask her about musical heroes and
the names that keep popping up are Judy Garland, Peggy Lee, and Sinatra.
What appeals to her about them is how they styled their material. Their
influence is evident in her work: her eloquent descriptions of what she
admires about their singing could easily have been written about her.
''I love how Lee handles a ballad: she's so straight. There's no
nonsense with her; it's pure voice. Frank Sinatra had an enormous
influence on me because of the way he uses his voice -- he never throws
a note away; every note counts.''
Carol Kidd was born and brought up in the East End of Glasgow, and
was, she says, always singing. ''I come from a big family, and had the
old tenement style of upbringing where you had all your cousins and your
aunties and your uncles living around and about you. We were always
having get-togethers and sing-songs and I was the life and soul of every
party -- from the age of four. Those were the days when they had
backcourt concerts and I used to dress up like Carmen Miranda. My daddy
would stand me up on a table and get me to sing, so it's always been a
natural thing for me to do.''
The greatest single influence on her was possibly her mother. ''She
absolutely lived for the movies. Twice a week without fail we'd go to
see things like The Wizard of Oz or Doris Day movies -- anything with
music and dancing in it. I used to walk down the street totally
convinced that I had an orchestra playing at my back -- I could hear it
-- and I thought: 'If Doris Day can do it, I can do it.' ''
Kidd's mother was also extremely supportive of her desire to compete
in the talent contests that were all the rage when she was 10 years old.
She had only one serious contender for the first prize in these contests
-- another East End 10-year-old who later changed her name to Lulu.
''Every talent contest I went to there was Lulu with her mum. It got
to the stage where I would win it, then she would win it . . . and we
decided that what we should do was have her go as far away from the east
side as possible, and I'd stay where I was.''
The Kidd repertoire was gleaned from the radio. ''If a song came on
and I liked it, I'd go out and search for the record.'' It just so
happened that the first record she bought was a jazz one: Ella
Fitzgerald's Manhattan. ''That was one of the grown-up songs that I
learned and sang all the time. So I was getting into a jazz feel,
without realising what it was -- to me it was just a good song.''
It was also coincidental that what Kidd was naturally inclined to do
with a song -- sing it straight then bring more of herself to it through
improvisation -- was, by definition, exactly what jazz singers do.
And so Kidd found herself in The West Coast Jazz Band at the age of
15. The other members of the band were all aged about 20, and Kidd had
to be chaperoned everywhere, until she married the trombonist, George
Kidd, two years into her stint with them.
By the time she was 19 she had two children and was singing seven
nights a week. Not only was her routine exhausting, but she found that
the trad jazz genre had a limiting effect on her singing. ''It can
become quite tedious. There's not much you can do with numbers like Bill
Bailey, and I really wanted to sing proper songs, so the band didn't
really suit me.''
In the early 1970s, Kidd dipped her toe into the cabaret circuit but
quickly withdrew it again. In 1980, after a four-year hiatus, she was
invited by the vibes player Jimmy Feighan to replace his band's singer
at the Kelvin Lorne's Saturday lunchtime slot. She went along to
audition, and stayed with the group for eight years.
That gig proved to be the launch-pad for Kidd's singing career.
Working with a regular band allowed her to forge a relationship with the
individual musicians, in particular with the pianist Sandy Taylor.
''Sandy and I hit it off straight away, and there was this telepathy
thing going on which was very special. For the first time, I felt I had
an identity.''
From the band emerged the trio of Taylor, bassist Alec Moore, and
drummer Murray Smith, and with them, Kidd began to carve a niche for
herself in the jazz scene.
In 1984, Kidd and Murray Smith clubbed together to finance her first
album. The master tape was sent to Linn Products to be pressed, and they
were so taken with it that they offered to take it over and pay for a
follow-up. As her name became known, she began to command bigger
audiences, and found herself being booked into larger venues.
By this time, she and her family had moved from Scotstoun to
Garelochhead, where they ran a hotel. ''We just slipped into it,'' she
says. After another four years, the Kidd marriage was over (they had
split up just after acquiring the hotel), and she made the momentous
decision to leave Scotland for Cambridge to be with her new, and
current, partner, John. Although in retrospect it looks like a
calculated career move, it was actually a huge gamble: Kidd had to leave
all her musicians behind and find a new trio.
It paid off with dividends: Kidd's 1990 album, The Night We Called It
a Day -- her first with fellow Scot Dave Newton (piano), Allan Ganley
(drums), and Dave Green (bass) -- was directly responsible for securing
the Sinatra gig, and acclaim from beyond Scotland.
Her previous records (she has, with one exception, recorded an album
every year since 1984 for Linn) all sell well; especially All My
Tomorrows which features When I Dream, which was one of former hostage
Terry Waite's Desert Island Discs. What next, the world?
Actually, yes: next week, after a one-night stand with the City of
Glasgow Philharmonic at the Royal Concert Hall, Kidd and her 12-man band
embark on a six-date tour of China -- the first time in 40 years that a
British artist has performed in that country. Not bad for someone who
admits that she's ''never taken it seriously''.
* Carol Kidd and the City of Glasgow Philharmonic Orchestra, Glasgow
Royal Concert Hall, Sunday at 7.30pm.
Those were the days: Carol Kidd recalls the backcourt concerts of her
childhood when she dressed up like Carmen Miranda. ''My daddy would
stand me up on a table and get me to sing, so it's always been a natural
thing for me to do.''

POWER STRUGGLE
SCOTTISHPOWER'S bid is worth more to Manweb shareholders than the
Chester-based company's defence package and ''rump'' value, broker
NatWest Securities said yesterday.
The Glasgow-based utility is offering 11 shares and #61.70 for every
10 Manweb shares.
Analysts at NatWest's Edinburgh office point out that the 617p per
share cash element of the ScottishPower bid has a greater value than
Manweb's defence package, which is worth 605p to institutional
investors.
Using as a comparative the market valuation of Northern Electric,
which has embarked on an exercise similar to Manweb's own defence plans,
NatWest believes a post-defence Manweb share would be worth less than
1.1 ScottishPower shares.
Electricity analyst Adam Forsyth said Northern Electric's share price
would have to rise by about 20% for there to be more value in holding
Manweb than in accepting ScottishPower's bid.
Ironically, with ScottishPower shares having fallen heavily yesterday,
losing 10[1/2]p to 343p, the company's cash-plus-shares bid was worth 8p
less than Manweb's 1002p closing price.
However, Manweb's share price reflects the possibility of a ''white
knight'' bid and NatWest is comparing ScottishPower's cash-plus-shares
bid with Manweb's defence package and rump value. The Glasgow-based
utility is offering an all-cash alternative of 990p.
Manweb plans to give shareholders a special dividend of 50p per share,
a payout of 203p associated with the company's restructuring, a
Preference share worth 125p, and another 172p through distribution of
its stake in the National Grid.
Institutional investors, which own the bulk of Manweb, would receive
total tax credits of 55p per share, related to the special dividend and
National Grid distribution.
These tax credits would not apply to private shareholders and unit
trusts.
NatWest recommends that, in the absence of a white knight bid, Manweb
shareholders should accept ScottishPower's #1100m offer.
However, with Manweb still in ''substantive talks'' with a potential
overseas bidder, widely believed to be US power company Pacificorp,
NatWest obviously advises shareholders to wait until next week.
A white knight has until October 6, the end of the 60-day offer
period, to make a rival bid.
If Manweb was to announce that its talks with the potential overseas
bidder had come to nought late next week, the Takeover Panel might allow
shareholders time beyond October 6 to decide whether to accept the
ScottishPower offer.
ScottishPower is making no secret of its ability to counter any white
knight bid and is probably capable of increasing its offer by about
#1-a-share. However, it is giving no clues as to whether it would want
to do so or whether it would look elsewhere for an acquisition.
A company spokesman said yesterday: ''ScottishPower is a strong
company with considerable financial resources. However, until such time
as there is a rival offer on the table, there is no decision to be
made.''

THE plight of poor old Kilmarnock FC (no, we really mean it) has us
turning to thoughts of possible investors and the means by which
government could assist them. Perhaps a call to Madrid and the state-run
Argentaria Corporation Bancaria de Espana might help.
This estimable bank has, it seems, set up accounts in which the
dividend on a three-year deposit is determined by the standings of
Spain's 22 first division teams. With a minimum deposit of 200,000
pesetas (about #1000) a client chooses the team he believes will finish
top.
According to reports, picking the league champion earns a 13% return.
A second, third or fourth place realises 11%, while depositors can get
8% if their team avoids relegation (Hearts fans please note).
All in all this, it seems to us, this offers the ideal solution for
loyal supporters wishing to put their money where their mouths generally
are. Of course, steps would have to be taken to prevent Mr David Murray
from ending up owning the whole bank, but you have to draw a line
somewhere.
Patriot games
AND SO we fall to Perth, where there is a disturbance at the City
Halls.
Something to do with independence, we gather. Or is it devolution? Or
both perhaps? In any case many fine people are having a wonderful time
pretending that these questions matter not at all to their undying
friendship and their unshakable unity in the struggle to achieve one, or
the other, or perhaps both. Everybody in the SNP is in agreement about
everything, which is very agreeable.
The Diary found it fascinating, however, that so many leading lights
thought it necessary not only to pop out of the auditorium for discreet
chats with lone journalists but to leave the building itself when the
compelling need to express their absolute support for Alex Salmond
overcame them.
Perhaps they just wanted a little fresh air. Or perhaps -- we await
advice -- it is the inalienable right of every prospective parliamentary
candidate to reiterate his total approval of the leader's tactics in the
privacy of a busy street far from the presence of other patriots who
might just be interested in new definitions of loyalty. Thus refreshed,
they can then return to the hall and help out with the next standing
ovation for the convener.
A list of trust-them-with-your-life sorts is, needless to say,
available.
One for the book
''THE trouble with writer's block is that it never gets written
about.''
Author Robert Harris mournfully explaining on the BBC's Omnibus why
his latest novel is only 18 months late.
* A BILLBOARD for A Certain Tabloid: ''Frank Fearless Free''. Good old
Frank . . .
* THEY don't write headlines like that any more. Well they do,
actually, and in more than one of the English prints: ''Estefan survives
fatal crash'', they said. And for her next trick . . .
Soft spot
A FINE city, Perth, boasting a one-way traffic system standing
comparison with the most baffling the world has to offer and many fine
shops. One such, we could not help but notice, sells children's wear. We
also could not help but notice that it rejoices in the name
Koo-Chee-Koo.
Fortunately, lunch had not yet been taken.
Gotcha
STILL in Perth, there was a disturbance concerning the SNP and the
domestic media. How different the behaviour of Scotland's many friends
overseas.
Thus, at a small party to celebrate the opening of her new
constituency offices on Friday night, Perth MP Roseanna Cunningham
recalled being belittled by the Observer for a post-by-election claim
that news of her victory would echo around the world.
Someone should calm her down, the Sunday had suggested. Ha! retorted
the MP, in so many words, producing in evidence front-page reports in
papers as far away as Australia.
To support this position Alex Salmond then flourished a copy of the
English-language Buenos Aires Herald. Sure enough: ''Scot Nats Win''
said the front-page report date-lined, with exemplary expatriate
simplicity, ''Perth''.
The Diary notes, for no pressing reason, that on the morning after the
conference ended neither the Independent on Sunday nor the Sunday
Telegraph, to name only two, had a single word to say, either good or
bad, about the SNP.
Argentina 1, England 0 . . .
Branching out
SOMETHING very like nostalgia afflicted old Edinburgh lefties in Perth
as Alex Wood, former Labour leader of the capital's district council,
took to the stage.
Woody, having concluded during the Great Poll Tax Wars that up with
the People's Party he would no longer put, struck out on his own for a
while, founding and fronting a worthy socialist grouping known in
certain Edinburgh circles as the ANP (Alex's New Party). This proved
short-lived, and last week found the wee man among the Nats.
What struck some people forcibly was not the many sensible things that
Alex had to say -- nothing new there -- but the fact that they were
exactly the sort of things he has always said. Woody, one of Edinburgh
Labour's more memorable champions, hasn't changed at all.
All of which might just tell us something about the party he left
behind, no? In any case, we look forward to a frank exchange of views
when someone next tries to call Mr Wood a tartan Tory.
Strong stuff
STILL, the cause marches on. We know this because a pub (otherwise
known as the ''International Press Centre'') close to the City Halls was
last week stocking two guest ales.
One, at a mighty 5.2%, was named ''Independence''. The other, a
watery, puny froth of no intellectual consequence weighing in at a
pitiful 4.2%, laboured under the name ''Devolution''. And as though to
disprove wrong all the dire Unionist predictions of the frightening
price of Independence, it only cost #1.10 a pint. Not quite ''Free by
93'', but close enough.
Meanwhile, and contrary to anything Margaret Ewing might inadvertently
have suggested, at the International Press Centre you don't have to wait
50 years to be served.

Bessie Delany, centenarian author, born in North Carolina, September
3, 1891, died in New York, September 25, 1995
BESSIE Delany, who with her sister Sarah found fame after the age of
100 as co-author of a best-selling African-American memoir on life
before the Civil Rights era, died at her home in Mount Vernon, New York,
on Monday aged 104.
Their reminiscence, Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100
Years has become a high school and college text and sold more than
900,000 copies in 1993. It has been translated into four languages and
is the basis for a Broadway show.
Annie Elizabeth Delany was one of 10 children who grew up in Raleigh,
North Carolina, where her father, a former slave, became a school
vice-principal and the nation's first elected black Episcopal bishop.
In their twenties, Bessie and Sarah moved to New York City, where they
attended Columbia University. Bessie became a dentist and opened a
clinic in Harlem. Sarah became the first black domestic-science teacher
in the city's public schools.
Despite such relative privilege, Delany did not escape the segregated
South and narrowly escaped a lynching for talking back to a white man.
''It was a hard life, but it was a sweet life,'' Bessie Delany said in
1993.
She and her sister, known as Sadie, lived their lives together, except
for a period when as young adults they taught in different parts of the
South. They spent the last 38 years in the New York City suburb of Mount
Vernon. Both celebrated their birthdays this month; Bessie turned 104 on
September 3, and Sadie 106 on September 19.
''When people ask me how we've lived past 100, I say, 'Honey, we never
married; we never had husbands to worry us to death','' Bessie Delany
would quip.
Bessie Delany's sister said of her: ''Especially the last couple years
she has been having a ball, between the play and books, she has been
having the time of her life.''
In addition to her sister, Bessie Delany is survived by 14 nieces and
nephews.

John Brunner, science fiction writer and visionary; born, Oxfordshire,
September 24, 1934, died, Glasgow, August 25, 1995
TWENTY years ago the first public road-sign to the information
superhighway went up. It was called The Shockwave Rider (1975) and it
was written by John Brunner who died in Glasgow during last month's
World Science Fiction Convention.
In this book Brunner predicted that by the end of the century there
would be a vast network of computers accessible to a large proportion of
the general public and capable of carrying complex electronic viruses.
At the time the book was dismissed by some as being technically unsound.
Such things as computer viruses were regarded as very far fetched as was
the global-scale network he envisaged.
Born John Killian Houston Brunner in 1934 in Preston Crowmarsh,
Oxfordshire, he was educated at Cheltenham and wrote his first novel at
the age of 17, using the pseudonym Gill Hunt.
He went on to write more than 80 books and was rewarded with numerous
awards and honours, among them the Hugo Award in 1968, the most coveted
in science-fiction, the British Science Fiction Award, and the Prix
Apollo.
Today he is still criticised but not for being far-fetched, rather for
being the ''father' of the computer virus. The argument is that had The
Shockwave Rider never been written we would not have today's lucrative
virus-protection industry. This is, of course, nonsense.
John Brunner's worries about what we now call the Internet were 20
years ahead of their time. He was concerned about how it might be used
and abused by those in power and what new dangers might lurk within it.
In this The Shockwave Rider is typical of his work. He was a writer
very much concerned with social and moral issues. His science-fiction
was always set on this bedrock as he belonged to the school of SF
writers who regarded the genre as a literature of ideas.
This was not always a popular stance and led to the curious condition
of him being a world-class SF writer who sometimes had difficulty
finding a publisher for his books. In his latter years this was a
particularly pernicious situation.
Never a stranger to controversy, he had left-wing views which were
well known among his friends and associates. His commitment to the
anti-nuclear weapons movement often comes as a surprise to those who
regard science-fiction as a right-wing fictional form.
Indeed his fiction concentrated on many of the issues: overpopulation
featured in Stand on Zanzibar (1968), global pollution in The Sheep Look
(1972), and manipulation of the populace by politicians in Squares of
the City.
His uncompromising criticism of the pseudo-science of such as Erich
von Daniken and L Ron Hubbard was also typical. An individual of high
personal and professional principles he is sorely missed by his friends
and contemporaries. He was married twice, his first wife dying in 1986.
He then married Liyi Tan.

George Dunnet, ecologist and academic; born, Caithness, April 19,
1928, died, Copenhagen, September 11, 1995
PROFESSOR George Dunnet leaves behind him a reputation as one of
Scotland's most distinguished ecologists, respected teachers, and
effective committee chairmen.
His friends remember him as a man with a great sense of humour, a
favourite dinner guest and a person who loved Scottish dancing and
croquet.
Students who might have been intimidated by his mighty academic
reputation found him to be a warm, approachable teacher without a hint
of pomposity.
Born in Dunnet, Caithness, on April 19, in 1928, he married Margaret
Thomson in 1953 and is survived by a son and a daughter. A second
daughter predeceased him.
He was generally acknowledged to be a fine negotiator and committee
man, able to apply his deep understanding of ecology to practical and
policy issues. His most enduring achievement was the establishment of
Culterty, the field station of Aberdeen University's zoology department,
as a centre of postgraduate research and training in ecology.
The field station originated in 1957 when the university was given the
house and its extensive grounds set in the village of Newburgh.
In 1958, Professor Vero Wynne-Edwards appointed Dunnet, who had gained
first class honours in zoology at Aberdeen, followed by a doctorate on
the breeding of starlings in relation to their food supply, to take over
its development.
It was while working briefly at the Bureau of Animal Populations in
Oxford that he married Margaret ''Mom'' Thomson, a fellow Aberdeen
graduate. He then took up a five-year appointment with the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia.
On his return to an Aberdeen University lectureship based at Culterty,
he established research programmes on birds in the Ythan estuary and on
the fauna of the surrounding farmland.
In the 30 years that Professor Dunnet was responsible for the field
station, nearly 100 postgraduates, half of them from overseas, gained
higher degrees there and went on to play an important role in ecological
science in Britain and elsewhere.
While in Australia, Dunnet had worked principally on the ecology of
mammals, but on his return to Scotland he concentrated on the ecology of
birds. One of his most important projects was the study of fulmars on
the Orkney Island of Eynhallow, work which still continues and is
considered one of the most important studies on lifetime reproductive
success of a bird anywhere in the world.
In 1990, the British Ornithological Union presented Dunnet with the
Godman Salvin Medal, and in the same year, the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, of which he was a fellow for 20 years, awarded him the Neill
Medal.
While still an undergraduate, Dunnet published his first paper on the
fleas of British mammals. He continued that work while in Australia and
was to lay the groundwork for research that eventually added more than
40 species and subspecies to the flea fauna of Australia.
Dunnet succeeded Wynne-Edwards as Regius Professor of Natural History
at Aberdeen in 1974 and later served as dean of science.
Ahead of his time in many areas of the practical application of
environmental knowledge, he became one of the first experts to advise
MPs that fish-farming had the potential to cause environmental problems.
He also established and chaired the Aberdeen University Environmental
Liaison Group which, in 1977, evolved into the Shetland Oil Terminal
Group, which acted as a go-between for the oil industry and
environmentalists.
He was again called upon in 1986 to chair the Review Team on Badgers
and Bovine Tuberculosis and his recommendations are still followed
today.
One of his greatest challenges was the chairmanship of the Salmon
Advisory Committee, set up to advise ministers on the conservation and
development of salmon fisheries, which he chaired from its inception in
1986 until his death.
He also sat on the Advisory Committee on Science of the Nature
Conservancy Council, which he chaired shortly before the NCC was
replaced by country agencies which in turn evolved into Scottish Natural
Heritage, an amalgam of the NCCS and the Countryside Commission for
Scotland.
The changes coincided with his partial retirement from university
work, and he became chairman of the NCCS Science, Research and
Development Board, and then became a member of the main board of SNH and
chairman of its research board.
Dunnet felt he had a special role to perform as the only scientist on
the main board of SNH, but to his great regret, felt obliged to resign
because he felt that the voice of science was not being given sufficient
attention.
At the time of his death -- September 11, 1995, while in Copenhagen --
he was retired but continued to advise colleagues on environmental
issues. He was in Denmark to chair an international panel of experts
examining the environmental impact of the proposed bridge between
Denmark and Sweden. He was also an enthusiastic participant in an
Overseas Development Agency project advising the Azerbaijan Government
on how to protect the Caspian Sea during the projected oil developments.

SCOTLAND'S two biggest railway stations are each to get a #1m upgrade.
Railtrack Property, the London-based company which assumed control of
Britain's 13 showpiece rail links earlier this year, will spend the
money on Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central stations.
The work, including major roof refurbishment and reception areas for
European passenger services, will begin next month.
The Waverley refurbishment was welcomed by civic leaders.
City council leader Lesley Hinds said: ''One of the first places
people visiting the city see is the station, and it is important to have
a quality environment. It is also important to the thousands of people
who regularly use the station.''
Around 1000 square metres of glazed roofing over the west end of the
Waverley concourse will be replaced by March next year.
About #250,000 will also be spent on a new reception and waiting area
at platforms 20 to 21, for Euro passengers. The building will
incorporate seating for 70 with toilets, including facilities for the
disabled.
Retail space at Waverley will also be increased with the removal of an
information desk in the middle of the travel centre.
At Glasgow Central, about 500 square metres of glazing over platforms
1 and 13 are to be replaced and #125,000 facilities for European
travellers will be built on platform 11.
The project is part of an on-going programme at Central Station.
Recent improvements have included the installation of an electronic
information multi-lingual tourist terminal, new disabled toilets and a
revamped theme pub.
Mr Peter Monaghan, general manager of Railtrack Property's major
stations division, yesterday welcomed the plans.
''These improvements are part of an ongoing scheme to ensure that
these major stations provide a pleasant environment for our customers
now and into the 21st century,'' he said.
Further approval for the Waverley plans came from Lord Provost
Norman Irons, who said he was ''very pleased'' with the project, and
from the Cockburn Association, a preservation group with a strong
interest in the station.
Spokesman Mr Terry Levinthal said: ''We would welcome the investment
Railtrack Property is making in the station. The work on the roof is
much needed.''

Dorothy Dickson, actress and musical-comedy star; born, Kansas City,
July 25, 1893, died, London, September 26, 1995
DOROTHY DICKSON, who died in London at the age of 102, was a legendary
star of musical comedy in London's West End, a famous pantomime
principal boy, and one of the Queen Mother's oldest friends.
Born in America -- her father was a well known Chicago journalist --
she made her debut on Broadway in 1917 in Jerome Kern's Oh Boy! in which
she danced with her husband, Carl Hyson, then a top ballroom dancer,
whom she had married, at age 21, against her parents' wishes. They
formed a brilliant partnership and other Broadway shows followed,
including the Ziegfeld Follies. In 1921 the British impresario C B
Cochrane brought the couple, who had been running a dance club in New
York, to London to appear in his revue, London, Paris and New York at
the Pavilion.
Dorothy scored a huge success -- Cochrane said her dancing was
''delicate as thistledown'' -- and went on to become a fixture in the
musical comedies of the next two decades. She was famous for her beauty,
her peaches-and-cream complexion, her golden hair, and her sex appeal.
After the Cochrane revue she starred in Kern's Sally, introducing to
Britain his evergreen song, Look for the Silver Lining, which was to
become her signature tune. Her husband, however, was not enjoying
similar success and two years later they separated. In 1936 they were
divorced and she never remarried.
In 1923, when she was starring in another Kern musical, The Cabaret
Girl, she met then then Lady Elizabeth Bowes Lyon who had come backstage
with her fiance, the Duke of York. It was the start of an enduring
friendship with Lady Elizabeth and at Miss Dickson's 80th birthday party
the Queen Mother is said to have entered the room singing Dancing Time,
the hit song from the show, which is one of her favourites.
At the invitation of Sir James Barrie, Dorothy Dickson played Peter
Pan twice in 1925 and 1926, and in 1931 proved herself one of the
classic, thigh-slapping pantomime principal boys with her performance in
Dick Whittington at the Garrick.
In 1937 she appeared in the Ivor Novello hit, Crest of the Wave, which
Malcolm MacDonald -- son of Ramsay MacDonald -- with whom she had fallen
in love, owned up to having seen 14 times.
In 1941, when MacDonald was appointed British High Commissioner in
Canada, he asked her to marry him but she decided she must remain in
Britain. During the war she appeared in several revues, and toured with
ENSA. But her greatest achievement was to set up the Stage Door Canteen
in Picadilly where troops on leave were entertained.
After the war she had straight theatre roles in Maugham's Our Betters
(1946), as a woman with a dubious past in Red Letter Day (1952), and
enjoyed a late success playing a retired musical comedy star in As Long
As They're Happy with Jack Buchanan (1953). But her career was by then
coming to an end, and, although she continued to enjoy the status of
grande dame of the theatre, she retired. She knew everyone, was feted
whenever she appeared, and made her last stage appearance in 1980 at a
theatrical gala celebrating 75 years of Peter Pan.
She is survived by her daughter, the former actress Dorothy Hyson,
widow of Sir Anthony Quayle, and one of her three grandchildren is the
actress Jenny Quayle.

Sir John Orr, senior police officer and sportman; born, Edinburgh,
June 13, 1918, died Edinburgh, September 27, 1995
JOHN ORR was a big man in every sense. A tall, distinguished figure,
he made a sizable contribution to law and order in Scotland and also to
its sporting life.
Educated at George Heriot's School, he joined the former Edinburgh
City Police as a boy clerk in 1937 before being appointed to the regular
force as a constable soon after. Six years later he went into the Royal
Air Force as an air crew navigator, attaining the rank of flying
officer. On his demobilisation two years on, he returned to the police
and rose through the ranks until his appointment as chief constable of
Dundee City Police in 1960.
Eight years later he was appointed to a similar post with the then
Lothians and Peebles Constabulary and in 1975, when local government was
reorganised, he became the first chief constable of the newly formed
Lothian and Borders Police, the second-largest force north of the
Border. This amalgamated Edinburgh City Police, Lothians and Peebles
Constabulary, and Berwick, Roxburgh and Selkirk Constabulary.
During 1969 he served as vice-president of the Association of Chief
Police Officers in Scotland and as president in the association's
centenary year, 1970. He was appointed interim secretary in 1974 and
secretary a year later, in which capacity he continued until 1983.
During his distinguished service as chief constable, Sir John, in the
three forces for which he was responsible, actively encouraged the
development and use of new procedures and technological aids and
equipment as these became available, in an effort to improve working
conditions and the efficiency of the police.
On one occasion in the late 70s his desire to see his officers
well-equipped prompted him to voice fears publicly of a collapse of law
and order. In a stern warning he told councillors that if the force
continued to operate under-strength and under-equipped it would very
soon become impossible to maintain order. He said the law-abiding public
faced a dangerous position and warned the problems would certainly
multiply.
In another example of not shying away from controversy he declared to
an Edinburgh seminar that the country's legal system was fast falling
apart at the seams.
He criticised many established practices which clogged up the
efficient operation of the courts and spoke of the ''frightening
reality'' that for all the declarations by central government, the
surveys, studies, and publications, crime was continuing on a steady
rise.
Away from work, Sir John -- knighted in 1979 after earlier awards of
the OBE in 1972 and the Queen's Police Medal five years later --
maintained a strong interest in sport, in particular rugby. He was
capped twice for his country in 1947 at a time when he was playing for
Edinburgh City Police team.
His first cap came against France in a game which was played on New
Year's Day and which was the first international match after the Second
World War. His second cap was against Wales.
A past president of George Heriot's School FP Rugby Club, he became a
member of the committee of the Scottish Rugby Union in 1960-61 but for
only one year because his police career took him to Dundee. He came back
to the SRU as vice-president in 1974-75 and was appointed president in
1975-76.
Mr Bill Hogg, chief executive of the SRU, said last night that Sir
John had played a major and ''sterling'' role in helping to look after
the hundreds of VIPs who attended the Rugby World Cup in 1991 and the
Rugby World Sevens two years later. ''He was a most welcome visitor to
Murrayfield,'' said Mr Hogg.
Sir John, who was an enthusiastic golfer and gardener, was a member of
the executive committee which organised the Commonwealth Games in
Edinburgh in 1986. He was a popular figure within the Scottish Amateur
Athletics Association of which he was honorary president for six years.
He had a deep lifelong commitment to George Heriot's School, stemming
from his time as a foundationer pupil whose fees were paid because his
father had died.
Sir John is survived by his wife, Isobel, and two children, John and
Margaret. His funeral will take place on Saturday at 11.30am at Juniper
Green Parish Church near his home in the city's Lanark Road. The service
will be followed by a private cremation.

AN attempt to have City trader Nick Leeson extradited from a German
prison cell to the United Kingdom instead of Singapore to stand trial on
fraud charges that led to the collapse of Barings Bank was mounted in
London yesterday.
A private prosecution by bond holders before the City of London
Magistrates Court led to an order that he appears before them on October
30 to answer charges.
As a consequence, Home Secretary Michael Howard will be petitioned to
seek the extradition of Mr Leeson, currently being held in a Frankfurt
jail, to the UK.
The private prosecution declares that the alleged offences were
committed within the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court and that
there is a substantial public interest in their being tried at the Old
Bailey.
Last night it was considered unlikely that Mr Howard would pursue the
matter with great vigour.
Serious Fraud Office investigators have interviewed Mr Leeson, and
their advice is that the Singapore authorities, as prime investigators
into the allegations against Mr Leeson, have first claim on any court
hearing.
Lawyers in the Home Office were in consultation last night with Mr
Leeson's solicitor. However, the indications were that Mr Howard was
under no obligation to seek the extradition of Mr Leeson to this country
as a direct consequence of the magistrates court decision.
Mr Leeson amassed #860m in debts in alleged unauthorised deals. He
left Singapore shortly before Barings collapsed and was arrested in
Germany en route to the UK.
In six days of interviews with officers from the SFO, Mr Leeson did
admit to offences which could be tried in the UK and which could carry a
maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment.
Yesterday, eight summonses on Mr Leeson were issued by the magistrates
court on behalf of bond bearers, who claim crimes were committed.
The summonses allege that Mr Leeson obtained more than #200m by
deception from Baring Securities, claiming that the money was needed to
meet his margin liabilities on Singapore's Simex stock exchange.
A regional court in Frankfurt is due to rule on the extradition
application by the Singapore authorities early next month.

IN what is now an obviously secular society, who worships what, where
and when may seem like a matter of interest only to those worshippers
and to the very small band of committed atheists who can be bothered
arguing about the privileges of religion. But there is a bigger
political issue raised by the Scottish Church Census.
Most nationalist movements rest their claims on the existence of a
supposed ''nation'', with a distinct cultural identity, a common history
and common ancestors. At the heart of the defining culture is a religion
which unites the ethnic group and divides them from their neighbours:
Catholic Poland versus Orthodox Russia. Catholic Croats versus Orthodox
Serbs versus Muslim Bosnians. Catholic Irish versus Ulster Protestants.
Scottish nationalism has always had difficulty with the Scottish
''nation'' or ''people'' because it has been so internally divided;
Highlands and Lowlands; in the Lowlands, Presbyterians versus Catholics.
Very sensibly, the SNP has stayed away from such ethnicity. Scottish
Nationalists emphasise that one does not have to be descended from 10
generations of Scots, and speak Gaelic or Doric to qualify. Anyone who
lives in Scotland is a Scot.
Indeed, the party is so opposed to ethnic considerations that it took
the very rare step of seeking and gaining an interim interdict to stop
people supporting it. Scottish Watch, an anti-English campaigning group,
was banned from distributing literature supporting Roseanna Cunningham
in the Perth and Kinross by-election.
Clearly this civic and inclusive definition of Scottishness is vital
if the SNP is ever going to break out of its rural small-town
Presbyterian culture and not only win Govan but hold it and other
industrial seats where Catholic descendants of the Irish make up a large
part of the electorate.
The secularisation of Scotland will make that appeal easier. With the
Kirk and the Catholic Church losing active members and the vast majority
of the population outside the churches, the Protestant-Catholic divide
will weaken. That increases the odds on a shared sense of Scottish
identity emerging.
But the sword is double-edged. Presbyterianism was one of the last
things that distinguished English-speaking Lowlanders from the English.
Scots are becoming more like each other in their irreligion but they are
also becoming more like the English.

SCOTTISH criminals are forsaking the shotgun for the pistol as their
favoured weapon and are increasingly likely to shoot, according to new
figures.
Recorded offences involving handguns rose nearly 50% last year to 72,
the highest for a decade, and crimes where imitation firearms were used
went up 60% to 139. At the same time shotgun offences were down one
third to 172.
Scottish Office statistics also show that the number of crimes where
guns are actually fired, rather than used to threaten, rose to 384, a
20% increase compared to 1993.
Home Affairs Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said the figures
were a cause for concern.
''Part of the problem is that there are too many unlicensed weapons. I
know that the police act very thoroughly in detecting and confiscating
illegally-held guns and the courts treat very seriously offenders who
commit crimes involving the use of firearms.
''For its part, the Government will be considering the recommendation
of the Firearms Consultative Committee that a firearms amnesty should be
held.''
Gun crimes, excluding air weapons, have more than doubled in the last
10 years, peaking in 1992. Air weapons accounted for more than 1000 of
the 1778 offences last year, but their use has gradually declined since
1985.
Firearms accounted for nine murders, 42 attempted murders and 359
assaults in 1994. They were used in 371 robberies, although fired in
only three of these.
However, the figures show improved clear-up rates by police, up 5% to
44% of recorded firearm offences.
* Lord James yesterday pledged full Scottish Office support for the
new police authorities due to take control next April. Speaking after a
visit to the Lothian and Borders Police HQ in Edinburgh, he said there
would still be eight local forces in Scotland, administered through
joint boards drawn from the 32 new councils.

* THE Scottish Church Census demonstrates what most professional
church people have long known: Scotland is no longer a Christian
country. Only a small proportion of Scots attend church and only some of
them attend the ''national'' church.
This calls into question both the rights and the obligations of the
churches. With so few people sufficiently interested in Christianity to
bother to attend church, why do we still give large amounts of airtime
to Thought for the Day, Prayer for the Day, the BBC's Songs of Praise or
Grampian Television's Reflections?
Why do we give pages of newsprint to the deliberations of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland? Why do we give more attention to the
views of clergymen than we do to those of any other poorly paid
professional group? Why is religious activity tax deductible? Why should
a religious organisation have its separate school system funded by the
state yet retain control over personnel?
There may well be very good answers to these questions along the lines
that ''religion is good for a society even if no-one believes it'' but
''because the churches are popular'' can no longer serve.
That the churches are now small bodies of self-selecting members may
be a reason to deprive them of their privileges but it may also be a
reason to free them from onerous obligations. Very many people who do
nothing to support a church none the less expect to be married and
buried by one and get huffy if the minister or priest is less than
enthusiastic about expending the organisation's resources on
non-members. The AA does not have to rescue non-members. Why should the
Kirk?
It may be humbling for what was once the national church to think of
itself as a sect, like the Baptists, but it may also be liberating.

As the three sides in the Bosnian conflict, under pressure from
America and the international community, try to halt the bloodshed in
the Balkans, Tom Gallagher examines the huge hurdles which lie ahead for
the negotiators
PRESIDENT Clinton was careful to stress after Tuesday's agreement
signed in New York by the parties to the Bosnian conflict that this was
no sell-out. Under it Bosnia-Herzegovina would remain a separate
independent country. However, it took much American arm-twisting to get
the Bosnian Foreign Minister, Mohammed Sacirbey, to attend the talks.
The constitutional provisions thrashed out in New York gave more powers
to the Sarajevo government but they do not overturn the Geneva agreement
of September 8, also brokered by the Americans, which allowed for a
self-governing Bosnian Serb entity.
With war crime charges hanging over them, the rebel Serb leaders,
Radovan Karadzic and General Mladic, chose to stay away from New York
and were represented by Belgrade's Foreign Minister. As American
officials, anxious to allow Clinton to bask in a rare foreign policy
success, accentuated the positive, Sacirbey was glum. He insisted that
the new package accepted ethnic cleansing and might trigger more
forcible removals of populations.
Carl Bildt, the EU negotiator, was noticeably more downbeat than his
American counterpart, Richard Holbrooke, remarking on Tuesday that ''the
more we do, the more we are aware of the magnitude of the task ahead of
us''.
The task has been lightened somewhat by recent military gains by
non-Serb forces who now control about 50% of Bosnian territory, close to
the 51-49 split still envisaged by the American plan. But the major
sticking-point remains the internal frontiers of a Bosnian state divided
between radical Serbs and Croat leaderships and a Sarajevo government
committed to multi-culturalism.
The Holbrooke proposals would leave Karadzic's forces in control of
eastern Bosnia, where some of the worst atrocities were carried out
against Muslims during and after 1992. This once mainly Muslim area,
adjoining Serbia, has been emptied of Muslims except in the besieged
enclave of Gorazde which Sarajevo is determined to retain whatever
Washington advises.
The American plan would not restore Srebrenica or Zepa to Sarajevo
control, the UN-protected enclaves captured by the Serbs in July amid a
welter of blood. Neither would the systematic ethnic-cleansing of
Muslims in and around Banja Luka be overturned.
The Bosnian government will find it hard to accept a proposal which
accepts demographic changes arrived at by force. It is unlikely that the
military would tolerate it. In recent days, the Bosnian army, largely
composed of men driven from their homes in 1992-93, has shown scant
regard for appeals from Sarajevo leaders not to over-reach themselves on
the battlefield. Discoveries of mass graves near the north-western town
of Kluj have made them even more embittered.
The Holbrooke plan might widen splits in the government between those
prepared to settle for a largely Muslim statelet and others who see the
abandonment of a unified, multi-ethnic Bosnia as a betrayal of all that
has been fought for since 1992. Accordingly, Sarajevo is anxious to make
contact with Serb officials, untainted by war crimes, who might be
recognised as an alternative leadership to Karadzic, but it is not
proving an easy task.
Croat-Muslim rivalry over territory also places enormous strain on the
peace process. Croat aggression against Bosnia in 1992-93, shows that
recognising a state does not guarantee its borders. Zagreb called off
its proxy forces in western Bosnia under American pressure and a
federation between Sarajevo and Croat-held Bosnia was agreed in March
1994. But those western areas of Bosnia remain beyond the control of
Sarajevo.
Croat forces liberating towns in western Bosnia this month have raised
Croatian not Bosnian flags.
The city of Sarajevo is the primary contested space which makes a
peace settlement elusive. A divided Sarajevo or an entirely Serb
Sarajevo has always been a major war aim of the Serb extremists.
Arguably, General Mladic's prosecution of the siege was a blunder which
made the Pale Serbs an object of international outrage while not
strengthening their statelet in any way. The Geneva agreement allowed
for Serb withdrawal from land around Sarajevo but Karadzic's forces
actually control large populated areas within the city boundaries and
the future administration of the city will be a major stumbling block.
Holbrooke has brought with him an inventory of proposals as he has
shuttled around the Balkans searching for agreement on frameworks and
general principles. But it is clear that he envisages large-scale
territorial swaps in order to achieve ''defensible'' international
frontiers. Inevitably, this will involve huge transfers of population so
that when the fighting ends, a majority of Bosnians may find that they
are resettled far away from their old homes.
Outside Bosnia, there is the problem of eastern Slavonia, the only
part of Croatia still in Serb hands, which happens to be the most
oil-rich part of the Balkans.
American motives and the depth of their staying-power in the Balkans
are still shrouded in mystery. If the main aim behind Holbrooke's
efforts is to make Bill Clinton more electable in 1996, it will surely
fail and perhaps produce more chaos and suffering than it found. The
Americans will have to back up their diplomacy with economic incentives
and be sensitive to the plight of those refugees for whom no easy
solution is at hand, or else a new generation of extremists will be
born.
They will have to make sure that Bosnia does not become a protectorate
of Croatia and new principles will have to be established in the Balkans
that do not permit land grabs by frustrated states with minorities in
neighbouring territories. The American Congress, in Republican hands,
will also have to like what it sees and agree to the deployment of up to
25,000 American troops to implement any peace plans.
Holbrooke, nicknamed the Balkan Kissinger, and his ''can do'' advisers
are the lineal descendants of a group of young Americans President
Wilson asked in October 1917 to redraft the map of the Balkans.
Believing that the principle of national self-determination could
provide a viable alternative to the Europe of dynasties like the
Hapsburgs, the young Walter Lippmann and other bright Americans got to
work in the New York City Library with maps and piles of statistics.
But the peace settlement they influenced at Versailles created new
ethnic states with downtrodden minorities that paved the way for the
Second World War. If Holbrooke's initiative unwittingly allows ethnic
cleansing to be a routine way of solving territorial or minority
disputes, further tragedy may be hard to avoid which sucks in other
parts of Europe so far unaffected by the Balkan wars.
A lot therefore hangs on the latest attempt by Americans to put the
Old World to rights.

* CHURCH attendance continues to decline. On census day in 1851, about
a third of the Scottish people went to church. In 1984 17% of adult
Scots attended church. Last year it was 14%.
This is still above the English figure of 10% but the annual rate of
decline, with the Kirk losing 2% per annum, is faster than that of the
English churches. If the trend continues, Scotland will soon lose its
claim to be more religious than England.
* THE two major players -- the Church of Scotland and the Catholic
Church -- which between them have over 80% of churchgoers, bear the
brunt of decline but the older small churches (the Free Church,
Methodists and Salvation Army) each lost about 12% of their attenders
between 1990 and 1994.
The main area of growth is in the independent evangelical and
pentecostal milieu. But though the increase in those bodies often called
''house churches'' is impressive, it starts from a very small base and
makes no impact on the overall decline.
* SOME of the decline is natural attrition. About one third of the
missing have gone to meet their maker, but two-thirds have simply
defected.
* THE Protestant churches have a major problem with their fabric.
Church buildings have not been closed in line with the shrinking
attendances. Instead, the same large edifices are inhabited by ever
fewer people. This means that running and repair costs, which increase
as the building ages, fall on ever fewer shoulders. It also means that
many services are profoundly depressing: the echo of the few gladsome
voices a pointed reminder of their declining numbers.
In summary, the Scottish Church Census shows that, while there is some
slight flow in the evangelical and pentecostal wings, Christianity is
becoming ever more a matter for a small band of enthusiasts.

CLEARLY it is possible to be religious without being active in any
formal religious organisation. Opinion polls repeatedly show twice as
many people describing themselves as ''religious'' as belong to
churches. We can reasonably be a little sceptical about such claims. If
I tell you that I am indeed a big football fan but then admit that I do
not support any particular club, have not been to a game for 30 years,
do not watch matches on television, never read the sports pages of
newspapers, and cannot name 10 top footballers, you will begin to wonder
what is involved in my notion of being a football fan.
Further probing suggests that many of the survey respondents who call
themselves religious mean only that they are ''decent''. For a lot of us
a religious person is not someone who believes in the supernatural but
someone who behaves morally and ethically.
To get a clearer sense of how popular is religion, we can draw on
three different sorts of information.
* Church membership records: Protestant churches, because they give
them such rights as a vote for their minister, usually keep records of
members. We can add these up. But the Catholic Church does not have
members; rather it counts all of those whom it has baptised as members
of its community.
Protestant churches differ in the way that membership is defined. In
the Free Church and Free Presbyterian Church it used to be common for
people to attend diligently all their lives and still not feel worthy
enough to ask for full membership. Even in a single denomination,
congregations may differ in how frequently they update their rolls.
* Opinion polls: Since the 1930s the most common source of information
about people's beliefs and behaviour has been the opinion poll. A small
sample of the population is asked a battery of questions and the answers
are taken as representative of the wider society. But, as was
embarrassingly exposed with the poll results before the last General
Election, opinion polls can mislead. The sample might not be
representative of the wider society. And they might not be honest,
either with the person asking the questions or with themselves. We know
that people tend to give the answers that they think are expected or are
acceptable.
A recent American research team went to great lengths to identify
every place of worship in a county of Ohio, sent questionnaires asking
about attendance to each of those churches, and sent observers to count
attenders at those churches which had not sent in their forms. They then
interviewed a random sample of people in the county and asked them about
their church-going habits. Almost twice as many people claimed to have
attended church as actually did so.
* Clergy estimates: The 1851 census asked clergymen to estimate the
attendance at their services. After the results were published the
social reformer William Wilberforce, a keen defender of the Church of
England, tried to diminish the evidence of Methodist success by accusing
nonconformist ministers of exaggerating. Displaying outrageous snobbery,
he said: ''Many of their ministers were not often in the same rank of
life as the clergy of the established church!''
It might indeed be the case that clergymen tend to look on the bright
side, which is why we can have confidence in clergy estimates which show
small and declining congregations. After all, why should they
under-estimate their support?

A 14-YEAR-OLD girl was left untreated in a hospital ward the day
before she died because she was in ''limbo'' between two teams of
doctors, it was claimed yesterday.
Lorraine McGalliard was ''left in limbo between the surgical and
gynaecological teams'' at Glasgow's Stobhill Hospital, according to
General Medical Council barrister Rosalind Foster.
Ms Foster is outlining the case against senior surgical consultant
Robert Dalling before the GMC's Professional Conduct Committee.
If found guilty of serious professional misconduct, Mr Dalling faces
being struck off.
On September 12, 1993, the day before Lorraine, of Kirkintilloch,
died, she was seen by Mr Dalling, who is now charged with failing to
assess and monitor her condition.
Lorraine had been in hospital since the early hours of September 11
complaining of severe stomach pains.
She had already been to the hospital twice before, on September 8 and
9. She had seen her GP five times before that, although previously she
had been very healthy.
Mr Dalling examined her on September 12 in the presence of a senior
house officer at Stobhill, Dr Matt Oakley, who had admitted her.
Ms Foster questioned Dr Oakley, attempting to show how Mr Dalling did
not establish Lorraine's condition for himself, but relied on
examinations by the more junior doctor.
Asked how he explained her condition, Dr Oakley said: ''I would have
presented this as a 14-year-old girl who has come back with a problem of
persistent abdominal pains, reportedly very severe at home.
''No evidence of peritonism, I can't remember exactly what I said,
just the framework.''
He explained that Lorraine had been examined by a gynaecologist the
night before and he told Mr Dalling about this.
He said: ''I said I felt it was a gynaecological problem and the
gynaecologist didn't agree, so we thought an ultrasound would answer the
question.''
Ms Foster: ''Was it your idea to have it on the Sunday?'' Dr Oakley
answered: ''I thought that was reasonable, but I wouldn't arrange it
without Mr Dalling.''
Mr Dalling decided to have the scan done on Monday morning.
Ms Foster asked: ''Were any instructions given by Mr Dalling about
liaising with the gynaecologist?'' Dr Oakley replied: ''I don't remember
specific instructions. I thought they were implied.''
Dr Oakley also confirmed Mr Dalling did not take Lorraine's record on
the round, and made no note of his visit and brief examinination of her.
The case continues.

As New Labour shies away from all things controversial in order to
remain voter-friendly, a new book presents an alternative manifesto
which many on the left might quietly support but dare not advocate,
reports Julia Langdon
THE key to this book is immediately obvious from the title -- Ayes to
the Left. A future for socialism. ''Socialism'' is not, these days, a
word in widespread usage within the modern Labour Party; at least not
among the leaders of ''New'' Labour. Down among the poor infantry it is
all rather different, as we may just see next week in Brighton.
That will depend on the extent to which the conference is governed by
a sense of the coming General Election. It is highly likely that the
political mood will already be set in pre-electoral mode and the
comrades will behave themselves.
Peter Hain has also been very careful not to upset the impression of
calm through which Tony Blair is attempting to cruise towards the
anticipated Labour victory. You can tell that because there are only
three references in the index to Tony Blair and two for Neil Kinnock,
and they are both only mentioned in passing. The likes of Gramsci and
Chomsky get mentioned rather more often. It would be wrong, however, to
infer from this that the book does not contain a personal message for
the Labour leader. That is exactly what it is all about.
It is, in short, a left-wing policy statement establishing the agenda
which Peter Hain, for one, believes the next Labour Government should
pursue and which is implicitly critical of the means by which the Labour
Party has arrived at its present perceived stance in British politics.
Hain is treated with a little gentle scepticism in some quarters of the
left -- where suspicions remain of someone who can today espouse
left-wing policies with such relish having once been a highly prominent
member of the Liberal Party -- but that is not to say that there are not
plenty who will agree with his prescriptions.
This book is also a warning to Mr Blair, and written in blood-red
block capitals, about the problems that lie ahead of him.
In his introduction, Hain describes it as a modest attempt ''to give
confidence in the commonsense of contemporary socialism''. That means to
remind people in the Labour Party that they should not be ashamed to
call themselves socialist. His purpose is to start a debate which will
regenerate the left and while he deliberately avoids direct
trouble-making, his intention is obviously to try to recapture the
policy-making initiative for the left.
He may well be too late for that. As the past year has shown, Tony
Blair's dominance of his party is absolute. There may be those who do
not like it and a few of them have shown as much in the course of the
past summer, but there is little room for dissent in the ''New'' Labour
Party.
And that is the point. The Labour Party appears terrified even of
allowing debate. It is this which Peter Hain wants to correct. As an
illustration of the problem, he cites the vote to change the wording of
Clause Four of the party's constitution last spring. There were many who
may have balked at the idea of giving Tony Blair the support he demanded
but who were persuaded by the political imperative. The Labour Party has
been out of office too long.
So Peter Hain has written Tony Blair's alternative manifesto for him.
He asserts that the present circumstances provide the best opportunity
in 50 years for socialism to win popular support in the democratic world
and he goes on to describe just how this chance should be seized.
His thesis is a libertarian one; not the unrestrained liberty of the
free market but that of libertarian socialism. He believes it possible
for a Labour Government to propound a radical ideology which will be
eagerly grasped by a generation longing for a different approach, not
one which is merely a more socially democratic adaptation of all that
has happened since 1979.
He is somewhat ambitious and very optimistic. The book is a work of
serious political analysis which may be welcomed in some quarters, but
not by anyone looking for an easy read. Even so, it is probably
important that the message he wants to conveyed is published now before
the election campaign is really under way, before a Labour Government is
elected. By then it will certainly be too late, if it is not already. I
suspect that the clock has already struck.
* Ayes to the Left. A future for socialism, by Peter Hain; Lawrence
and Wishart, #10.99.

Anne Johnstone examines why chicken producers, who have so far escaped
the attention of the animal welfare lobby, should now find themselves
targets of a damning report
WE eat 670 million chickens a year in Britain. That's one a month for
every man, woman and child. In recent years poulet a la anything you
like has shot up in popularity because it is generally cheaper, and is
perceived as healthier, than red meat. Also, Britain's booming broiler
industry has managed to steer clear of the animal welfare scandals which
have dogged the livestock industry and battery egg production. No
longer.
Yesterday Compassion in World Farming, the pressure group which
brought us the veal calves saga, gave the chicken farmers a roasting.
Caring consumers, says Joyce D'Silva of CIWF, should boycott all chicken
except free range. The charity is also calling on the Government to
introduce a range of welfare measures. The broiler chicken is the only
one of Britain's factory-farmed animals with no specific laws to protect
it. Yet even by animal standards, the life of a broiler chicken is nasty
and short.
The report, The Welfare of Broiler Chickens, highlights a series of
problems.
Modern broilers are bred to reach slaughter weight in just 42 days,
about twice as fast as 30 years ago. They grow so fast that the legs
cannot support the body and distort. ''We found that about 14 million
are so lame they can only move around the sheds by crawling on their
shanks, using their wing tips as crutches,'' says D'Silva. Professor
John Webster, of Bristol University says: ''This must constitute the
single most extreme example of man's inhumanity to another sentient
creature.''
Researchers have found that about 20% of broiler chickens develop
heart disease. This is also the result of selective breeding and
accelerated growth rates.
''As the broilers grow, conditions become increasingly cramped until
it becomes impossible to see the floor, so thickly is it carpeted with
chickens,'' says the report.
A Government welfare code, which isn't legally binding, and which,
according to the report, is often ignored, lays down a minimum area of
.55 sq.ft for each broiler to live in -- an area smaller than the cover
of a telephone directory. The report calls for lower stocking densities
and wants them to be legally binding.
And there's a specific problem about breeder flocks. Because modern
broilers are bred to grow at a phenomenal rate, in breeder flocks growth
has to be retarded if the birds are to survive long enough to produce
subsequent generations. A study carried out in 1993 found that this was
done by keeping breeders ''chronically hungry, frustrated and
stressed''.
However, this fate may be preferable to that awaiting broilers going
to slaughter. According to the CIWF report about 20 million birds suffer
broken bones in transit. These creatures can't be sold whole for
roasting so are made into portions, according to Joyce D'Silva.
Once at the slaughterhouse, they are hung by the legs and electrocuted
by passing them through an electrically charged bath to stun them. Their
necks are cut before they are plunged into a scalding bath. ''We fear
many broilers may regain consciousness during bleeding out as a result
of ineffective stunning and inefficient neck-cutting. Some may even be
alive on entering the scalding tank,'' says the report, which recommends
a minimum level of stunning current and the severing of both carotid
arteries before scalding.
The impression given by the report is that this is an industry which
operates behind closed doors, largely away from public scrutiny and that
it is one in which the remorseless drive to cut costs has been at the
expense of the birds' welfare.
The Marshall Food Group, Scotland's largest producer of broiler
chickens, denies this. Marshalls employes more than 4000 workers across
Scotland and last year made profits of more than #5m. The company
produces 1.3 million chickens a week. Customers include Marks and
Spencer, Tesco, and Safeway.
''Marshalls works extremely hard to operate to high standards,'' said
PR Rachel Jones. ''We follow the stocking density approved by the Farm
Animal Welfare Council. All our production is independently monitored by
veterinary surgeons. I'm not qualified to comment on the claims about
leg problems. As for broken bones, I think it is very unlikely that this
is a big problem for us. It sounds as if the CIWF report is very
emotive. We keep our chickens warm and safe. They are free to move and
people care about them.'' She said she could not answer specific
questions.
Earlier the British Poultry Meat Federation issued a statement
claiming that CIWF claims were ''seriously inaccurate''. The birds have
to be able to move around to reach their food and water troughs, they
say.
The statement said: ''British chicken producers are working with the
Farm Animal Welfare Council on a long-term programme specifically on leg
strength. Results so far show that the level of leg weakness alleged by
CIWF is hugely exaggerated.''

TRADE union chiefs fear job losses in the NHS in Edinburgh and predict
lay-offs and recruitment freezes in the capital's financial services
industry.
Senior members of the Manufacturing, Scientific and Finance Union,
which has 90,000 members, last night expressed concern over the
possibility of hundreds of job losses at the soon-to-be-built Royal
Infirmary of Edinburgh, due to open within the next five years.
They also spelled out fears over job losses and the general state of
the banking and investment industry.
MSF union boss Roger Lyons and regional officer Ian Fulton will lead a
delegation today to meet hospital chiefs and finance company bosses to
spell out their fears.
Mr Fulton said he was concerned that, of the 5500 people working at
the current Royal Infirmary at the Meadows, hundreds could lose their
jobs when its functions are transferred to a new #140m hospital with the
same name.
The union also said it was concerned about job losses in the finance
industry and disturbed about the impact this contraction would have on
school, college, and university leavers looking for jobs.
Mr Lyons said he would be meeting representatives of Scottish
Provident to discuss the critical issue of job losses.
No-one was available last night at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary to
comment.
A spokeswoman for Edinburgh Royal Infirmary NHS Trust said she could
not comment on the meeting.

Forget Paris (12) directed by Billy Crystal.
On general release.
The Bait (18) directed by Bertrand Tavernier.
GFT and Filmhouse.
Both films open tomorrow.
VERSATILITY is all very well, but sometimes a person can wear too many
hats for their own good. This is certainly the case with Forget Paris, a
romantic comedy directed by and starring Billy Crystal which he also
wrote in collaboration with Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel.
It is at least one job too many, for Crystal starred in When Harry Met
Sally which he also wrote with Ganz and Mandel, but it was directed by
Rob Reiner and the lack of a detached director's eye causes the problem.
Crystal is Mickey, a bellicose thirty-something basketball referee who
goes to Paris to supervise the funeral of his father, a Second World War
veteran who wants to be buried where he fought. The coffin gets lost, he
has to deal with an airline official, Ellen (Debra Winger), and they
fall in love, he being a nice Jewish boy, she a nice Jewish girl. That
they are totally unsuited to one another is by the way.
In due course they return to America, she gets a menial job, has to
put up with his awful apartment and his absences on the basketball
circuit. She insists they buy a house, they try to have a baby, she gets
a good job, he gives up his career to become a car salesman, has to put
up with her senile father, and goes back to basketball.
Can the marriage survive? The trouble is we don't care. Mickey is a
crude, bumptious little creature who behaves so badly the patently
intelligent Ellen would have left him without a backward look. There are
better fish in the Dead Sea, even. Winger, too good an actress to make a
hash of her role, cannot avoid giving the impression that she is
slumming, and has been ill served by the cameraman, Don Burgess. Nobody
is asking for plastic perfection, but making the female lead look
occasionally gormless and frequently plain is unforgivable.
By no means a total disaster, it will pass a wet evening amiably
enough because the script is very funny, although the one-liners,
particularly those allotted to Crystal, pop up so relentlessly that the
effect is rather like Neil Simon on speed. Every time anyone gets
remotely serious the mood is punctured by a wisecrack.
The ingenious framework within which this romance between this
distinctly odd couple is narrated is one of the best things about the
film. Forty- something sports writer Joe Mantegna is waiting in a
restaurant with his fiancee, Cynthia Stevenson, for some friends to join
them to celebrate their engagement.
He starts to tell her how Mickey met Ellen, and as his friends arrive
they take over the story. Since they are played by Richard Masur, Julie
Kavner and Cathy Moriarty this proves extremely entertaining, and the
scenes also provide a break from Crystal's posturing, suggesting that,
had he cast someone else, an actor with charm, as Mickey, he might have
made a better film.
The big question is will Mickey and Ellen turn up as promised and, if
they do, are they still together? But who cares? The reek of missed
opportunities hangs heavy over Forget Paris. Occasionally too few cooks
spoil the broth.
Critical reactions to Bertrand Tavernier's The Bait have been varied.
Some have found it glib and unctious with a tendency to salivate over
the admittedly delicious body of its star, Marie Gillain, a delectable
18-year-old, who takes her clothes off quite a lot. Others, including
the jury at Berlin this year, where it won the the Golden Bear, found it
a powerful account of teenagers living in a morally bankrupt society who
turn without a thought to killing.
It is based on a true case in France about 10 years ago in which two
boys and a girl set out to rob wealthy men and ended up killing two of
them in a brutal and callous manner. Tavernier and his wife, Colo, have
constructed a script which moves slowly and deliberately to its climax,
avoiding sensationalism and keeping the violence virtually off screen
for most of the film. There are no Tarentino-type pyrotechnics, although
in his own oblique way Tavernier makes the violence every bit as
chilling as a full frontal assault on the audience's senses would have
been.
Nathalie (Gillain) is 18, a shop assistant and would be-actress
looking for that lucky break. She lives with her boyfriend, Eric (Oliver
Sitruk), and his less than bright, but devoted best friend, Bruno (Bruno
Putzlu) in a flat provided by her mother. Nathalie spends her evenings
in smart bars and restaurants chatting up older men, recording their
addresses in her diary in the hope that they will be her entree.
Eric's wealthy father, fed up with his idle son's behaviour, has
stopped his allowance, and Bruno is unemployed. But Eric has plans. If
only he could lay his hands on 10 million francs they could all emigrate
to the US where they would make their fortunes with a chain of shops
selling jeans imported from the Far East. It is all, of course, pie in
the sky. Then one day he thinks of a way to get the money. They will rob
someone rich, and where better to find a victim than Nathalie's address
book?
The plan is Nathalie will persuade a man to invite her to his
apartment, then she will leave the door off the latch, the boys will
burst in, tie the man up and rob the safe they are convinced such men
always have hidden behind pictures. They have seen safes like that on
television therefore they exist.
These are children of the television age, materialist through and
through, whose idea of the world is based on advertisements and soap
operas. What they fail to realise is that the men Nathalie meets are not
really rich, but simply middle-aged versions of themselves living on
credit and out to pick up a young, pretty girl if they can. When the
boys find no money things go horribly wrong.
Tavernier cleverly distances the audience from the actual killings,
keeping his camera focused on Nathalie, who has been sent out of the
room in which the two boys are trying to get their victims to tell where
the money is hidden. She sits, listening to her Walkman, shutting out
any unpleasant noises, detached, remote, as if in the anteroom of a
doctor's surgery. Occasionally the door opens, and we get a glimpse of
what is happening, a device which heightens the meaninglessness of it
all.
There is no point to the killings, no excuse. These kids are not
psychopaths, anything but natural-born killers. They come from good
homes, have always had money, have been decently educated, and would
have prospects if they could be bothered to look for work. Tavernier has
taken a cool, dispassionate look at French society -- at European
society -- and found it wanting.

The compulsive need for sex can lead to severe problems, as Francis
Shennan discovers at a meeting of those who are afflicted
EVEN after hearing the phrase half a dozen times, with different names
as those in the room take turns to speak, it sounds strange: ''My name
is Patrick and I'm a sex addict.''
The room is in a church building, equipped with the kind of moderately
comfortable and anonymous furniture you often find in a manse or
presbytery. It is Sunday morning, but this is not a religious meeting.
Today, a half-dozen young men -- though women do attend -- sit around
a long dining table. At intervals are handwritten notices with messages
such as: ''What you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here,
let it stay here.''
The men had arrived mostly singly, greeted each other warmly with
handshakes and ''Good to see you,'' been offered tea or coffee, then sat
down for the formal opening of the meeting.
This is the weekly Glasgow meeting of Sex Addicts Anonymous, the only
group of its kind in Scotland and one of only four in Britain outside
London. Weekly meetings in London are regularly attended by 30 or more.
As the only journalist ever to sit in on this meeting, I will be trusted
to hear information and feelings tha they may not even tell partners and
those closest to them.
It will also force me to question some of my own attitudes, many of
which I share with society at large. It would be easier to scoff, to
make jokes about it, to look forward to some titillation, but that would
be to miss the whole point.
As always, the meeting opens with the reading of a preamble to remind
those present, and to reassure any newcomers, of what the meeting is:
''Sex Addicts Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their
experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their
common problem and help others to recover from sexual addiction. The
only requirement for membership is a desire to stop addictive sexual
behaviour.''
It goes on to explain that SAA is self-supporting through collections
at meetings; it is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics,
organisation, or institution; it is not sex therapy or group therapy.
SAA is, in fact, a recovery group. Although it has no organisational
link with Alcoholics Anonymous, it is based on the same 12 steps. The
steps, drawn up more than 60 years ago, have helped not only alcoholics
to sobriety, but have been adapted to many other forms of addictive or
compulsive behaviour.
As a result, there is now Gamblers Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous,
Over-Eaters Anonymous, and many more. All started in the United States,
and it is easy for Britons to characterise the recovery movement as a
symptom of American self-obsession. Yet there are recovery groups
throughout the world, and few would argue that AA, the best known, has
not had some conspicuous successes in this country.
Sex Addicts Anonymous is, worldwide, one of the fastest-growing
recovery movements, but is probably still years away from social
acceptability. There is general public understanding of alcoholism, but
not of sex addiction -- even in other recovery groups.
Both Willie and Patrick, who has been sober eight years, are
recovering alcoholics and regular attenders of AA meetings. They do not
identify themselves as sex addicts at AA, and both have heard alcoholics
making predictable jokes about sex addiction: ''Hah, wouldn't mind
having that addiction!''
Only two public figures have allowed themselves to be identified as
sex addicts: actor Rob Lowe after a well publicised court case involving
a video and under-age sex; and actor-producer Michael Douglas, who first
admitted to sex addiction while trying to save his marriage.
There are a growing number of books on the addiction, including Out Of
The Shadows and Don't Call it Live by one of the leading writers on the
subject, Dr Patrick Carnes, and the movement's ''big book,'' Hope and
Recovery, written by recovering addicts.
What then is sex addiction? Putting it most simply, it is being hooked
on any sexual behaviour that is compulsive. After the preamble, SAA
meetings have a reading of The Problem, an attempt to summarise the
nature of sex addiction.
''Many of us find that our histories have several characteristics in
common . . . '' it says. ''We lost the ability to trust in others to
fulfil our needs for nurturing and security. To compensate for our loss
we started to develop a reliance on sexual experience as a way of
escaping the pain and emptiness of our lives.
''Some of us feared being sexual at all -- we weren't able to see that
our sexuality was healthy and God-given. Looking for love in all the
wrong places, we became true addicts: promiscuity, dependent
relationships, abusive relationships, pornography, compulsive
masturbation, anonymous sexual encounters, and much more besides.''
This leads to one of the strengths and problems for SAA: the behaviour
can be different for each addict, and what may be unhealthy behaviour
for one may be all right for another.
It is not like AA, where everybody knows what sobriety means. In SAA,
each addict must decide what he or she needs to abstain from. What the
behaviours have in common is that they have become unmanageable. As the
first of the 12 steps says: ''We admitted we were powerless over our
sexual addiction -- that our lives had become unmanageable.''
For Patrick, one of the founder members of the Glasgow group, the
behaviour was cruising for prostitutes, calling sex chatlines, and using
pornography. A young father who works in building services, he was
putting his marriage under strain.
For Derek, who works in entertainment, the problem was casual
homosexual encounters. For Willie, who is unemployed, it was compulsive
masturbation.
For some of the women who have attended the group -- some individuals
sometimes go intermittently or perhaps for a few meetings until they
either draw enough strength or decide it is not for them -- the problems
have tended to be promiscuity or dependent relationships.
After the brief readings, members of the group are invited to ''check
in.'' Although there is no obligation on any of them to speak, they take
turns to report on how they have fared that week: any slips they have
made, any pressures they have been under.
This is the secret of SAA's success. For most, if not all, of the
group's members this will be their only opportunity to open up about
their feelings and behaviour, confident that they will not be criticised
or made to feel ashamed. It is not unknown for a new member to break
down in tears as he has the chance to say what he has never said in his
life before.
Each talks for as long as he wants, without interruption. He knows he
is accepted and that those listening understand what he is going
through. Whether he is heterosexual or homosexual, a womaniser or a
masturbator, though the behaviour is different, the feelings are the
same.
Their addiction is to the buzz that sexual excitement gives. It is
like a chemical addiction but the chemicals are inside their own bodies.
It is sex as a substitute for intimacy. As The Problem described it:
''We could never know true intimacy with another because we were
addicted to the unreal, the chemistry, the intoxication and the
intensity of the pursuit.''
The very shame they feel is likely to increase the habit. Shame makes
them feel isolated and the pain of that will drive them towards seeking
another ''hit''.
By allowing them to open up without being shamed, SAA reduces that
feeling of isolation, allows them to see they have value as individuals
which gives them the strength to counter the addiction.
The meeting may continue with this ''sharing'' or it may discuss a
particular aspect of sex addiction. After an hour and a half, it closes
with the Serenity Prayer used by all 12-step programmes: ''God grant me
the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change
the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.'' Although the
word ''God'' is used in the 12 steps, it is defined as the ''God of your
understanding'' so that no one need feel excluded.
There are handshakes, more tea and coffee, and time for a chat that
seems to include a lot of joking and laughing. People's numbers are
exchanged so there is somewhere to call when someone is feeling
vulnerable and about to slip.
One of the problems of sex addiction is that much of the behaviour
that sufferers want to be rid of may be regarded as normal, at least by
men. An acquaintance who could fairly be described as a serial adulterer
saw nothing wrong in his behaviour as long as no one was hurt.
A conversation with a decorator to get a quote for exterior paintwork
was constantly interrupted by his need to ''check out'' every woman who
walked by. Most definitions would include both behaviours in the
''compulsive'' category.
When newspapers combine topless models with sexual prurience and
erotica is a staple of movies and advertising, you could argue this is a
sexually-addicted society. Rather than an argument for censorship or a
new puritanism, it is an argument for a move from compulsive to healthy
sexual attitudes. Sex Addicts Anonymous is already moving in that
direction.

<HEADLINE>Staff fury over executive's plans. Trust to cut jobs after #1m errors</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>DAVID ROSS, HIGHLAND CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>11</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976158958</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Highland Communities NHS Trust will shed up to 45 jobs and will
consider closing one of four wards in the main geriatric hospital in
Inverness in an attempt to address a deficit of #1.8m.
Its chief executive will waive his performance-related bonus and ask
44 other senior managers to consider doing the same.
Staff last night described the proposals as appalling, and Ross,
Cromarty and Skye MP Charles Kennedy is calling on the Scottish Office
to make up the shortfall. There could be more cuts on the way.
The trust discovered last month that #1m of the deficit had been due
to errors in budget negotiations with Highland Health Board.
Yesterday in Inverness, trust chief executive St John Hattersley
unveiled a programme of economies which could save #1.3m this year.
This included: reprofiling management throughout the trust; a review
of senior managers' pay; market testing of services such as catering,
linen and supplies; tighter controls on overtime, travel and telephone
use; and assessing all vacancies to see if a replacement is necessary.
Mr Hattersley said steps would be taken to ensure that none of these
measures prejudiced patient care. He also explained the need to review
the use of geriatric beds at the Royal Northern Infirmary in Inverness,
saying that three wards would provide enough bed capacity on present
figures.
Mr Hattersley said that he hoped that most of the job cuts could be
achieved through voluntary and early retirement, but conceded that would
probably not be possible.
He said that the trust would certainly be looking at the whole issue
of performance-related pay.
He added: ''I have indicated on a purely personal basis that I will be
waiving any personal right to performance-related pay this year. It has
not actually been formally assessed, so I can't give you a precise
figure for that, but basically I shall be retaining my salary at the
current level (#54,000).''
But Mr Kennedy said last night: ''It is deeply wrong that patients
should face closed wards and that staff are likely to face redundancies
because of what was somebody else's mistake. I intend, when Parliament
resumes in a fortnight, to raise these matters directly with the
Scottish Health Minister.
''There is a clear-cut moral obligation on the part of the Scottish
Office to make good the shortfall, which should have been paid by the
health board to the trust originally. As things stand, innocent people
will suffer.''
Ms Alison Craig, secretary of the joint staff consultative committee,
said last night: ''The staff side are appalled at these proposals, and
are currently setting up teams of representatives to consult affected
staff.''
Meanwhile, Scotland's first NHS hospital trust has been ordered to
bring in financial consultants to help rescue it from a growing cash
crisis.
Bosses at the beleaguered Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust have
until the weekend to sort out their financial affairs, described by one
consultant as an ''absolute mess''.
The trust's finance director, Mr Douglas Lindsay, quit yesterday as it
was revealed the complex is facing losses of at least #2m.

* WE are delighted to report that The Herald Foundation for Women's
Health coffee mornings raised more than #25,000, and thank our readers
for generously supporting the venture.
To date, the Foundation has raised just under #60,000 and is well on
target. Other successful fund-raising events organised by The Herald
have helped to swell the coffers, too.
These include Hamilton Racecourse Ladies Night, which brought in #500,
and the London City Ballet, with a generous #2000. But it was the
contribution from our readers with their coffee morning sessions that
has been the most successful venture so far.
A new clinic at Glasgow Royal Infirmary will open officially tomorrow,
and will be known as The Herald Foundation Clinic for Women. We still
need money to pay for running costs. If you would like to help, please
fill in the coupon on this page.
* THOSE suffering from ME, or post-viral syndrome, are only too well
aware that many people, including some doctors, are unwilling to believe
the condition really exists, which only adds to the stress. So far there
is no known cure, but many people are helped by a range of alternative
and complementary treatments.
To find out more about such treatments, the Glasgow ME Support Group
is holding a special Symposium on Saturday, October 7, in Pollokshaws
Burgh Halls (opposite the Burrell Collection). Doors open 2pm. Further
information from the ME Association, 52 Enoch Square, Glasgow G14AA.
Phone: 204 3822.
It is hoped that by giving and sharing information on what does and
does not work for ME sufferers, more people will be able to begin to
take some control of their lives again.
* SELF-HELP groups on Eating Disorders, Older Women, and Irritable
Bowel Syndrome are among those meeting regularly in the new Glasgow
Centre for Women's Health at 6 Sandyford Place (next to the Eye
Infirmary).
To meet increased demand, opening hours have been extended from 10am
to 9 pm on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. More than 600 women have
visited the centre, which fulfills a number of roles, from purely social
to acting as a resource and information centre. Phone: 0141 211 6700.
* HAVING a child born with a deformed arm, or one that loses it as a
result of an accident, is rare. But both children and parents need
specialist help, and in 1978 Reach was set up by parents of children who
had lost the use of arms or hands. It was formed in direct response to
the development of a new electronically controlled artificial limb.
Today, Reach offers a forum and support group for parents and is holding
its annual general meeting in Glasgow on Saturday, October 14.
This will take place in the City Chambers, and speakers include two
doctors from Glasgow University: John Tolmie, a consultant in medical
genetics and David Stone, senior lecturer in paediatric epidemiology.
The event will also see the launch of a video about Reach. Further
information from the national co-ordinator, Sue Stokes, Reach, 12 Wilson
Way, Earls Barton, Northamptonshire NN6 ONZ; (01604 811041) or Elaine
Clarke, 214 Fenwick Road, Giffnock, Glasgow G46 6UE (0141 620 2238).
* WOMEN worried about breast cancer may be reluctant to go to their GP
to discuss their fears initially, but would welcome the opportunity to
talk about the problem first over the phone. October has been designated
the second annual Breast Care Awareness Month, and the NHS Helpline will
offer free, confidential advice and information on breast cancer each
weekday between 9am and 5pm.
It will also give information on a range of services, including
prosthesis fitting and the Breast Cancer Care Volunteer Services.
Further information from the NHS Helpline: 0800 224488.
* THIN women live longer than those who are obese, and there is no
risk attached to being a bit underweight, says a report in the current
issue of Medical Monitor, commenting on a new American study carried out
on 115,000 women over a 16-year period. It was found that overweight was
linked most strongly with heart disease, but a trend with cancer was
also noted.

TEENAGE rapist Calum McLeod had a history of sexual attacks against a
fellow resident in Creagdhu children's home in the south-west of
Glasgow, a television programme will claim tonight.
Fifteen-year-old McLeod was recently jailed for 10 years following a
string of sex attacks against women and trial judge Lord McCluskey took
the rare step of allowing him to be named despite his age.
Tonight's BBC Frontline Scotland edition will hear a young girl named
in the programme as ''Marie'' say she reported problems to staff at the
Creagdhu home. She claims they refused to act because they could not
control McLeod.
She says that when the staff did act they moved him into the room next
door to her own.
Tonight's film describes one establishment as ''no longer a suitable
place for children to live'' and claims many of the most disturbed
children in Strathclyde are supervised by untrained staff.
Statistics used in the programme indicate that almost four out of
every 10 senior managers in residential care establishments in Scotland
have no qualifications and that only one in eight has received the
recommended training.
The Skinner Report, published in 1992, recommended that 90% of senior
management and 30% of all staff should be qualified to diploma level or
equivalent by 1996.

Frankfurt
A FINANCIAL consultant suspected of hiding tennis star Steffi Graf's
wealth from tax authorities was detained today.
Investigators raided tax adviser Joachim Eckhardt's home near
Frankfurt, searching his office and seizing documents.
''There is a strong suspicion of tax evasion of a particularly serious
nature,'' said Mr Peter Wechsung, state prosecutor in the western city
of Mannheim.
It was reported that Eckhardt was suspected of tax evasion involving
up to #5m.
Eckhardt advised Graf's father, Peter, who managed the world tennis
number one's finances for years. Mr Graf is now in a German jail also on
suspicion of tax evasion.
Mr Graf was placed in investigative custody in August to prevent him
fleeing the country or altering evidence. His daughter is also subject
to a tax inquiry but state prosecutors have said they have no plans to
detain her.
Ms Graf, who this month added the 1995 US Open title to her string of
major tennis championships, has said she entrusted her financial affairs
to her father at the start of her career, and claims she has no idea how
much money she has earned.
State prosecutor Wechsung said a judge would decide later today
whether to remand Eckhardt in custody.-- Reuter.

TWO pilots and 15 passengers landed shaken but unharmed yesterday
after the North Sea helicopter taking them to an offshore rig developed
a severe vibration 55 miles out over the sea and had to return to shore
to make an emergency landing.
The Bond-owned AS332L Super Puma was making a crew change flight from
Aberdeen to the Italian oil firm Agip's Tiffany platform.
It was 15 minutes from the platform -- 140 miles north-east of
Aberdeen -- when the vibration started. Captain John Harrison decided at
8.48am to turn around and head back towards land.
The alert was raised by Bond and three Sea King rescue helicopters,
two from RAF Lossiemouth and one from RAF Boulmer, were scrambled. The
Peterhead lifeboat was also launched to be on standby in case the
helicopter was forced to ditch in the sea.
But Captain Harrison managed to land safely at Longside airfield, near
Peterhead -- the nearest landfall.
The emergency services were waiting as it landed at 9.22am but all 17
men were taken off the helicopter uninjured.
A spokesman for Grampian Police said: ''The helicopter was escorted to
Longside by two Bristows helicopters that were in the area.
''At 9.20am it made a safe landing and all crew and passengers
disembarked safe and well. It was a routine incident.''
A spokesman for Bond said: ''Exact details of the problem are not as
yet known, but are believed to have involved airframe vibration.'' He
said a senior engineering management team was at Longside investigating
the problem.

AT least 70 miners trapped inside two coal mines in eastern India were

''According to official information, last night in the Ajalgunj and
Chaitudih coal mines of the Bharat Coking Coal Ltd near Dhanbad around
70 workers have died over which the governor A R Kidwai has expressed

Bihar chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav demanded that the federal coal
ministry conduct a high level probe into the disaster.
This is the second major coal mine tragedy in Dhanbad since 1975, when
more than 300 miners died after water entered the Chasnala mines.
JOHANNESBURG: Five South African miners were killed and eight others

Jammu
KASHMIRI separatists holding four western hostages, including two
Britons, have obtained medical aid for their captives, according to
Indian officials. At least one captive is believed to be suffering from
snow blindness.
Intelligence sources said the kidnappers had arranged to have
paramedics examine and treat the hostages, although a spokesman for
Jammu and Kashmir state could not confirm that paramedics had actually
been to their mountain hideout.
Paul Wells, 23, from Blackburn, Lancashire, and Keith Mangan, 34, from
Tooting, south London, have been held for more than 12 weeks.
Their health is thought to have suffered from long marches at
altitude, shortages of food, and the cold.
The Al-Faran guerrillas and their hostages were spotted some weeks ago
in Kishtwar village buying sunglasses, shoes and medicine.
0 The kidnappers then arranged to have several local paramedics
examine and treat the hostages in Inshan village earlier this week,
according to intelligence sources.
The BBC reported that three paramedics had been taken by the
kidnappers to a hut where the hostages were being held, and had found
them suffering from various illnesses, mostly caused by the cold.
It claimed Indian authorities took the men up in a helicopter
yesterday to try to spot the hut, but they were said to be unable to
identify it.
However, this was denied by Kulbushan Jandial, spokesman for the state
government.
He added they had ordered all forces to stay away from the group so as
not to put the hostages' lives at risk. ''There's no question of going
in a helicopter and locating them.''
Al-Faran broke off talks with the Indian authorities eight days ago,
the longest gap in negotiations since the men were kidnapped.
Officials said they had been expecting an interruption because it had
become clear the kidnappers planned to move the hostages around the
region.
Mr Jandial said: ''There have been gaps of five or six days before and
they've come back. We hope they will come back in a day or so and we can
continue our search for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.''
In Srinagar, state police chief Mahender Sabharwal said though there
had been no news of the hostages for more than a week, he believed they
were unharmed. ''We have reason to believe they are safe,'' he said.
''We have contacts on different levels.''--Reuter.

United Nations
FRANCE and China, defying world criticism over their nuclear tests,
told the United Nations today that the blasts would go on as planned
before a treaty banning them was concluded next year.
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette and his Chinese counterpart,
Qian Qichen, stood firm in speeches to the UN General Assembly despite a
wave of criticism from Asian and European nations during this week's
meeting in New York.
De Charette said France was conducting a limited series of underground
blasts in the South Pacific so it could then sign a global treaty in
1996 banning all nuclear tests.
''There were some who imagined, and others who wished to make believe,
that we might reconsider such a decision,'' he said. ''This will not
happen. Once again, I repeat this is a final test series, limited to
what is strictly necessary and held under conditions that have been
proved to be harmless.''
China's Qian, whose country has been criticised for continued
underground tests at its Lop Nor test site, said Beijing would continue
to work for a test ban treaty.
''Once the treaty enters into force, China will stop its nuclear
testing,'' he said.
China and France are the only two official nuclear powers -- and
permanent members of the UN Security Council -- to continue nuclear
testing. The United States, Russia, and Britain have continued to
observe a 1992 moratorium.
France, which announced this year it would resume testing and set off
the first blast at the Mururoa atoll this month, argues it must complete
a series of tests to ensure the safety and viability of its nuclear
arsenal.
China says it has run fewer tests than other nuclear powers and
insists it wants to eliminate all nuclear weapons.
Nevertheless, Foreign Ministers from Scandinavia to the South Pacific
at the General Assembly have criticised the continued Chinese and French
tests this week and called on both countries to stop immediately.
While environmentalists say the tests are harmful, many governments
say they also undermine the commitments of the Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT), which is designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon met de Charette in New York
yesterday and said afterwards: ''It was pretty tense and pretty forceful
and I was making it clear to the French that the New Zealand public was
still very angry over this issue.''
* Environment group Greenpeace today vowed to continue hindering
France's South Pacific nuclear testing programme despite the seizure of
its fourth protest ship off the Mururoa atoll blast site yesterday.
''Our spirits are not dampened,'' said spokeswoman Lynette
Thorstensen.
The 40ft Greenpeace yacht Vega was boarded by French military
commandos just days before France was expected to carry out another
underground blast.--Reuter

The target
The three IRA terrorists were planning to bomb the band of the Royal
Anglians, right. The 'soft target' would provide the IRA with a
''spectacular'' and would have been murderon a grand scale.Ian Bruce,
Defence Correspondent, explains why the SAS took the only action
possible when they drew their guns and shot outside a garge in
Gibraltar.
THE three known IRA terrorists shot dead in Gibraltar by the SAS were
planning to detonate a 144lb Semtex bomb in a street crowded with
tourists and local onlookers.
In the best ''soft target'' tradition of the Provisionals, the primary
victims were to be the band of the Royal Anglians, due to play for the
changing of the guard as a public entertainment.
Within the blast radius of the powerful explosive, packed into a Ford
Fiesta which would act as hire-drive shrapnel, were both a school and an
old people's home. It was to have been what the IRA's Army Council
called ''a spectacular''. The aim was mass slaughter. It was to be
murder on a grand scale.
When Farrell, McCann, and Savage died in a hail of expertly-directed
SAS gunfire, they were engaged on a last reconnaissance of the chosen
killing ground. They were hit by 29 rounds from 9mm Browning automatic
pistols. Not a single bullet went astray and no civilians were injured
or endangered.
The Provos issued an immediate bulletin, mourning the loss of three
''volunteers from an active service unit''. The ASU is the classic
terrorist system of operating in three or four-man cells of gunmen and
bombers to minimise the risk of detection. It was an immediate admission
of guilt.
Acting on intelligence from a well-placed informant, the terrorists'
progress had been monitored by the security services from the time they
left Northern Ireland. They were not on a sightseeing tour.
The seven-strong SAS counter-terrorist team had flown to the Rock a
few days earlier. They were to have acted as a snatch team, overpowering
the Provo bombers and handing them over to MI5 for interrogation and
susequent prosecution. The SAS troopers would then have melted away,
their involvement in the operation still secret.
The plan went wrong when the security services failed to locate the
car bomb the IRA intended to use for their latest outrage. Then the
three under observation were seen walking towards the suspected target
area.
When the SAS closed in, it was on the clear understanding that no
chances could be taken. Any of the known Provo ''players'' might be
carrying a remote-control detonation device. All were likely to be
armed.
They were then shot as they turned to face the men bearing down on
them and moved their hands as if to reach for weapons. They were shot
dead to eliminate the risk of a last act of destruction and to avoid a
gun battle in which civilians might have been caught in the crossfire.
It was an act which made perfect military sense. It was not, as
claimed subsequently, a public demonstration of the British Government's
secret ''shoot-to-kill'' policy. No such policy ever existed beyond the
realms of Sinn Fein propaganda.
People are wounded in the arm or have weapons blown out of their hands
only in movies. In real life, anyone training for combat learns that
hitting anything with a handgun beyond point-blank range is a real
achievement.
When circumstances are close-up and personal, anyone planning to stay
alive aims for the centre of the body and keeps shooting until his
opponent goes down and stays down. SAS marksmen are taught that the
minimum needed is the ''double-tap'', two rounds to the head or central
chest.
Harry McCallion, a former SAS trooper who spent more than six years on
counter-terrorist duty in Ulster in the 1970s, explained yesterday:
''The Regiment (22 SAS) killed about 30 known players during the entire
25-year span of the Troubles.
''If we had been acting on orders to eliminate the terrorists, there
would have been 300 dead in short order. We shot to kill in
life-threatening situations and within the restrictions of the rules of
engagement in the province. It is not a game. If the other guy has a
gun, then you waste him. If you don't, he'll waste you.
''But there never was any shoot-to-kill policy outside the law, or any
secret agenda or hit-list. Nor was there any collusion with rogue
elements of the RUC. That's all so much bullshit. We had to account for
every round fired, and we stuck to that directive. The SAS is not a band
of trained assassins. It is a highly-motivated, highly-disciplined,
highly-trained military organisation.''
All governments operate undercover forces of some description. Many,
like the French, have few scruples about following the rule of law. The
sinking of Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior in a New Zealand harbour, and
the infiltration of hit teams into Spanish territory in pursuit of
Basque terrorists bear testimony to that.
The IRA terrorists who died in Gibraltar seven years ago were intent
on killing innocent civilians for mere publicity. It is ironic that
their supporters have now discovered a new respect for life.
McCann, Farrell, and Savage went to the colony with murder in mind.
They were self-confessed members of a terrorist organisation with a
bloody track record. Their fate, while dramatic, seems appropriate. In
the words of the unofficial motto of the Royal Marines, if you can't
take a joke, you shouldn't join.

THE newly-appointed Bosnian ambassador to Britain yesterday predicted
the agreement struck in New York over the future government in his
homeland would be temporary.
On his first visit to Scotland, Professor Muhamed Filipovic said: ''We
consider our people need the peace and, even though we know this peace
agreement is not a proper one and won't last very long, because it is
based on the division of the country and is not good for the situation,
we have accepted it under certain conditions.''
Ambassador Filipovic, 66, a former professor of philosophy at the
University of Sarajevo, said these conditions were that Bosnia remained
united as a country; those involved in war crimes were not involved in
any peace deal; and people were able to return to their homes and
property in peace.
''Under these conditions we are ready to sign the peace treaty, hoping
that the future international development will give us the opportunity
to reunite the Bosnian state and reintegrate Bosnia,'' he said.
Professor Filipovic met Scottish aid workers who have eased the misery
of refugees in Bosnia and the Bosnians who have made Scotland their
second home.
Dr Denis Rutovitz of Edinburgh Direct Aid, who was shot on a mercy
mission to Bosnia in April, said of the ambassador: ''His attitude is
one not of revenge, but of trying to bring about reconciliation and of
persuading people to stay.''

Jerusalem
THE Israeli Cabinet overwhelmingly agreed today to hand over to
Palestinians much of the West Bank it has occupied for 28 years.
After a five-hour debate, members backed the 400-page accord with PLO
head Yasser Arafat by 18-0, with two abstentions.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is due to sign the agreement in
Washington tomorrow at a summit with US President Bill Clinton and Arab
leaders President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan.
A senior PLO official said a problem over the starting date of Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank had been resolved in discussions with
Israel today.
Israeli Police Minister Moshe Shahal said earlier that Israel had been
surprised by the PLO's insistence that Israeli troops begin pulling out
of Arab West Bank population centres within 10 days of the White House
signing.
Shahal said the matter was under discussion with the PLO.
Later, during a stopover by Arafat in London, senior PLO official
Yasser Abed Rabbo said: ''It has been resolved. The Israelis have agreed
to redeploy 10 days after signing the agreement.''
Arafat had said that Israel agreed to the starting date when they
initialled the accord on Sunday, widening 16-month-old self-rule beyond
Gaza and Jericho into much of the West Bank occupied by Israel since the
1967 Middle East War.
Arafat blamed a printing error for the absence of a reference to the
10 days in the accord, copies of which have yet to be made public.
Israel said it would seal off the West Bank from midnight tonight
until early on Sunday, a security measure apparently aimed at preventing
Muslim militants from launching any attacks on Israel to spoil the peace
ceremony.
A week-old closure of Gaza will be extended until Sunday morning, it
said.
Israel's opposition meanwhile reacted angrily to a part of the deal
that will free thousands of Palestinian prisoners in two stages -- more
than 2000 of the 5300 the Jewish state says it still holds.
''In the first wave, about 1300 will be released. I would like to
stress that none has blood on his hands. No-one committed murder,''
Shahal told Israel Radio.
PLO chief negotiator Ahmed Korei said ultimately all would be
released. The accord will be put to a vote in Israel's Parliament on
October 5.
Rabin and Arafat, who sealed a breakthrough accord with a handshake on
the White House lawn two years ago, will be signing a document giving
the one million Palestinians of the West Bank more control over their
lives.
Under the deal negotiated over many difficult months, a pull-out from
six Arab cities and parts of Hebron and more than 400 villages is due to
be completed in six months, followed in 22 days by Palestinian
elections.
The accord allows for the continued presence of the 130,000 Jews in
West Bank and Gaza Strip settlements. The fate of the settlers,
Jerusalem, and Palestinian refugees will be negotiated in final-status
talks due to begin by May 1996.
Mubarak and King Hussein will witness the signing ceremony in
Washington, their countries having already signed treaties with the
Jewish state -- Egypt in 1979 and Jordan last year.
Two other front-line states, Israel's arch-foe Syria and Syria's ally
Lebanon, will not send their leaders.--Reuter.

Sarajevo
PRIME MINISTER Haris Silajdzic
said today that peace in Bosnia could be achieved in weeks if Big
Powers who have have engineered two agreements between the warring sides
maintained their pressure on the Serbs.
''If the international community does not get tricked by Belgrade --
and they're experts in this -- I would venture to say we can have peace
in a matter of weeks,'' Silajdzic told reporters in Sarajevo.
His optimism followed agreement between the foreign ministers of
Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia-led Yugoslavia in New York yesterday on
constitutional arrangements for Bosnia once the 3[1/2]-year conflict
ends.
However Bosnian Serb ''information minister'' Miroslav Toholj
underlined the difficulties ahead, stressing that Bosnian Serbs would
not drop their demand for ties with Yugoslavia, which the Sarajevo
government opposes.
Toholj said the talks with Sarajevo would lead to an end to the war
''because that is what the Big Powers want'', but the peace process
would ''last until the (Bosnian) Serb Republic and the Serbian people
obtain their independence and their right to self-determination''.
Agreements envisage Bosnia continuing as a single state composed of
two linked Serb and Muslim-Croat entities.
However the Bosnian Government had almost boycotted the New York talks
in protest at Serb pressure for the right to a form of federation
between Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serb republic.
Bosnian Government and Serb military envoys met today to discuss
restoring water, gas, and electricity supplies to Sarajevo, cut off by
the Serbs earlier this year.
Today's meeting followed the progress in international mediation and a
two-week Nato bombing campaign which forced the Serbs to remove most of
their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo.
In the absence of any ceasefire agreement, Bosnian army commander
General Rasim Delic cautioned on Sarajevo television that the war was
not over.
''I would prefer to suggest to people that they engage in everyday war
efforts rather than euphorically begin thinking of peace every time
there is some new peace initiative,'' he said.
''That cost us a lot in the recent past. We lost the initiative, we
lost territories, soldiers' morale would drop because everybody would
expect peace to come in two or three days . . . I do not expect it to
come quickly.''
Indeed, the Bosnian Serbs shelled
government defence lines around Sanski Most, Bosanski Novi, and
Mrkonjic Grad in north-west Bosnia last night and this morning.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic praised yesterday's New York
deal, saying: ''Tonight's agreement is a further step in the direction
of peace, and all those who are for a continuation of war will find it
hard to annul the results of the conference.''
And even the Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic, who with
Karadzic has been named as a war crimes suspect, told reporters in Banja
Luka that it was much better if conflict were resolved by peaceful and
diplomatic means.
Bosnia will have one parliament drawing two-thirds of its members from
the Muslim-Croat federation and one-third from the Bosnian Serb
republic.
Serbian nationalists in Belgrade described the agreement as a betrayal
of Bosnian Serb war aims, while ordinary people in Sarajevo were
sceptical that it would succeed.
Meanwhile, French Defence Minister Charles Millon said his government
now had proof that two French airmen shot down during the Nato
bombardment were held by the Bosnian Serbs.
''All procedures have been set in motion so that the Serbian
authorities assure their protection, and then we will see how they can
be brought back to France,'' he said.--Reuter.

Los Angeles
THE prosecution and the defence in the O J Simpson case painted two
very different pictures for the jury today on the accused.
Chief defence attorney Johnnie Cochran said police had used his client
as a scapegoat. But a prosecutor in the football hero's double murder
trial said Simpson stabbed his ex-wife to death because he had a
personal vendetta to settle and he wanted her to know who was killing
her.
''The hate that he has for her
. . . at that time, it is like it flows out of him and into the knife
and from the knife into her,'' Deputy District Attorney Christopher
Darden told the jury, referring to the night of June 12, 1994, when
Simpson allegedly murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
Darden said Goldman, a waiter who was returning a pair of glasses left
at a restaurant by Nicole Simpson's mother, was at ''the wrong place at
the wrong time''.
He said Simpson chose a knife because ''he wanted to make a statement;
he wanted to teach her a lesson; he wanted to let her know; he wanted
her to be there face-to-face to know just who it was who was doing this
to her.
''With each thrust of that knife into her body and into Ron's body
there is a release
. . . a gradual release of that anger and that rage and he stabs and
he cuts and he slices until that rage is gone and until these people are
dead -- and after that rage is gone he is better,'' the prosecutor said.
Simpson might have been ''one hell of a great football player but is
still a murderer'', Darden said.
He said Nicole Simpson's final rejection of him came on May 22, 1994,
when she gave him back a bracelet he had given her as a birthday gift,
but Simpson refused to accept that it was over.
In an effort to dispel any doubts the jury might have about Simpson
being capable of killing his ex-wife while their two children were in
the house, Darden played a police tape from October, 1993, when a
weeping Nicole Simpson told police Simpson had kicked her door down.
Simpson is heard screaming obscenities as she tells the operator the
children are in the house.
However, Cochran said he blamed the police for Simpson's predicament.
''From the very first orders issued by the so-called LAPD (Los Angeles
Police Department) brass, they were more concerned with their own
images. Because of their vanity, they very soon pretended to solve this
crime and . . . implicated an innocent man and they never, ever looked
for anyone else.''
Cochran scorned a prosecution theory that Simpson wore a knitted cap
to disguise himself. Putting on a cap, he told the jury: ''I'm still
Johnnie Cochran with a knit cap . . . O J Simpson in a knit cap from two
blocks away is still O J Simpson.''--Reuter

BRITAIN and Argentina signed an agreement at the United Nations in New
York today to encourage exploration and exploitation of oil and gas
deposits around the Falkland Islands.
The accord, signed by Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and Argentine
Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, comes 13 years after the Falklands war.
The agreement does not address rival claims to the islands.
It provides for the establishment of a joint commission, composed of
delegations from both sides, and co-ordinated activities in up to six
areas, each covering about 1350 square miles.
The commission, to meet at least twice a year, will promote
co-operation between industry on both sides, including the formation of
joint ventures, and submit recommendations for the protection of the
marine environment to both governments.
The Falkland Islands government intends launching a licensing round in
London next week.
In Buenos Aires, the centre-left opposition attacked the deal as an
implicit recognition of British rule in the islands.
Frepaso leaders criticised the Peronist government for ''misleading
public opinion'' by hailing the deal as a first step to recovering the
islands ''usurped'' by Britain in 1833.--Reuter.

The legal consequences
Yet another decison seems to have gone against the Government. Bruce
McKain, Law Correspondent, explains why the answer may lie in our
domestic law.
THERE is a temptation to regard yesterday's decision by the European
Court of Human Rights in the IRA terrorist case as simply the latest and
most outrageous in a series of loony decisions by a bunch of ignorant
foreigners.
We will no doubt be hearing again the question once posed by Tory MP
Ivor Stanbrook: ''Are the Government content that a group of unelected
foreigners should legislate for this country on matters of political and
social conscience?"
And Sir Ivan Lawrence no doubt spoke for many when he said recently:
''I am one of a growing number of people who are getting fed up being
told what to do by Europeans who do not share our history, our culture,
our traditions or the good sense of our courts.''
Even before yesterday's 10-9 decision in Strasbourg, judged by its
consistent losing record at the European Court of Human Rights, the UK
was the guilty man of Europe.
The immediate question is how can this possibly be, since even the
UK's sternest critics would concede that there are many countries whose
human rights record is signficantly worse than our own.
The most obvious answer seems to be that, unlike most other European
countries, Britain has consistently refused to incorporate the European
Convention on Human Rights into our domestic law.
The result is that anyone who claims a breach of the rights and
freedoms enshrined in the Convention -- to life, liberty, a fair trial,
expression of freedom and thought -- is denied a remedy in our own
courts.
Such cases must go directly to the European Commission of Human
Rights, an arm of the Council of Europe. The Commission, consisting of
jurists and legal experts, conducts a fact-finding exercise and tries to
reach an amicable settlement before reporting either to the European
Court or the Committee of Ministers of the Council Europe.
Each member State of the Council of Europe has one judge in the court
and the current UK Judge is 68-year-old Sir John Freeland, a barrister
and former adviser to the Foreign Office.
Ironically, given the UK record since, the Convention on Human Rights
was drafted in 1950 by the senior adviser to the Home Office, Sir Oscar
Dowson, and negotiated though the legal committee by Sir David
Maxwell-Fyfe (later Lord Chancellor Kilmuir) with the backing of
Churchill, Macmillan, and Bevan.
Britain was the first State to ratify the Convention but although it
accepts as binding the rulings of the Human Rights Court, there has been
a determined refusal by successive Governments to make the Convention
part of British law.
The argument is that it would undermine the sovereignty of Parliament
and embroil our judiciary in political controversies which would damage
their independence and with which they are not trained to deal.
It is an issue some British Government will have to face up to and
yesterday's decision may bring the day rather closer.
Jim Murdoch, a senior lecturer in Public Law at Glasgow University's
law school, thinks the quality and importance of the adverse European
rulings against the UK is more important that the sheer number.
''People here are aware of their rights and are prepared to go to
Strasbourg. For example, there have been a number of cases involving the
rights of prisoners in British jails.
''Obviously, conditions in British jails are not as bad as in, say,
Turkey, but, but British citizens are prepared to take cases to
Strasbourg, whereas in some other countries it would be regarded as a
highly risky step.''
He is not overly impressed with the argument that making the
Convention part of our domestic legal system would undermine the
judiciary.
''Judges in a number of other countries do it and our own judges are
are already dealing with political arguments and administrative cases,
which are just as politically sensitive as human rights issues.
''I think incorporating the Convention into our domestic law would
help defuse some of the cases that are going to Strasbourg at the
moment.''
Neither is Jim Murdoch convinced by the argument that ''foreigners''
should not be interfering in our domestic affairs.
''If you believe in the rule of law, that means international law just
as much as domestic law. One point the Eurpoean system is making to
Governments is that their are limits to their authority.''
Given the terrorist background to the Gibraltar shootings, it is easy
to dismiss the decision of the European Court as ludicrous and
impossible to justify.
Bur Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights states:
''Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in
contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force
which is no more than absolutely necessary.''
The ''absolutely necessary'' test is an extremely high one, probably
more exacting than would be demanded by a Scottish or English court.
There is a strong argument that it is the appropriate standard and
that no Government should be able to take away any right, particularly
the most important right, that of life, without passing that litmus
test.

The timetable
A TIMETABLE of the events which led to the European Court of Human
Rights' condemnation of Britain.
1988: March 6: Three unarmed members of an IRA ''active service
unit'', Mairead Farrell, Daniel McCann, and Sean Savage, are shot dead
by undercover SAS men in Gibraltar. Their nearby car is later found not
to contain the expected bomb.
March 8: The day the IRA team had planned to explode a powerful car
bomb near a military guard-changing ceremony. Spanish police find a
Semtex-laden white Ford Fiesta where the trio had left it, in an
underground car park in Marbella.
March 16: A loyalist gunman throws hand grenades at the funeral of the
three in Milltown cemetery, Belfast, killing three men and injuring
nearly 50.
March 19: At the funeral of one of those killed in the cemetery, two
Army corporals who drive into the path of the cortege are pulled from
their car and shot dead by the IRA.
April 28: Screening of the Thames TV documentary Death on the Rock,
with witnesses saying two of the bombers shot dead had been trying to
surrender.
September 6: The inquest on the Gibraltar killings opens. In its
opening days it hears that Savage was shot up to 18 times, Farrell eight
times, and McCann four times.
September 30: The coroner's jury decides by nine-two verdicts that the
shootings were justified. Ministry of Defence welcomes ''clear and
conclusive'' findings, and lawyer for unnamed SAS men says they have
been ''totally vindicated''.
1989: January 26: An independent inquiry clears Death on the Rock
programme of most serious criticisms. Within minutes the findings are
rejected by Downing Street, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of
Defence.
April 6: The National Council for Civil Liberties calls for a public
judicial inquiry into the Gibraltar shootings, saying the inquest may
have fallen short of standards required by international law.
1990: April 22: Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd signs orders barring

Families of the shot
THE families of the three IRA members said the judgment was ''a
complete vindication'' of their long campaign and they were pleased with
the decision.
They expressed disappointment that the court did not award any damages
but said they had undertaken the case in a quest for justice, not money.
They said it was time for a full independent judicial inquiry into the
killings.
The full statement, issued through solicitor Barra McGrory acting for
the relatives of Mairead Farrell, Sean Savage and Daniel McCann said:
''We have now received and considered the judgment of the European
Commission of Human Rights that the UK Government have been found in
breach of the right to life as enshrined by Article 2 of the European
Commission of Human Rights.
''The fact that this Court has not seen fit to award damages against
the Government is of some disappointment to us.
''We find this difficult to reconcile with the finding of unlawful
killing by the court. However, we undertook this case not for money but
in a quest for justice.
''We take this judgment to be a complete vindication of our long-held
belief that the deaths of our relatives were unnecessary.
''Our efforts to have a full independent inquiry into this incident
have been thwarted by the UK Government at every turn from the issuing
of Public Immunity Certificates at the inquest to the abrupt termination
of proceedings in the domestic courts.
''The findings of this court raise serious questions about the
planning and control of this operation and has found it lacking.''
Earlier, Mr Niall Farrell, brother of Mairead, described the ruling as
''a major decision''.
He said the decision was important for the Northern Ireland peace
process because it showed that Britain were ''not honest brokers''.
Mr Farrell added: ''It is now clear to the world that the British
government has blood on its hands.
''It is the establishment of the Council of Europe bringing the
establishment of Britain to court.
''That we even got to court was a huge victory. But that we won is
tremendous,'' he said.
He told Irish radio: ''It will give all those many other families who
have lost people in shoot-to-kill incidents a lot of hope. There's a
whole host of them.
''One thing that has irritated us throughout the whole seven years is
this talk of compensation. There is no way that we could be
compensated.''

The judgment.
The European Court of Human Rights has issued its verdict. Murray
Ritchie European Editor, explains why the ruling means little in
practical terms.
SEVEN hundred years ago William Tell found his place in history
because he was punished by a foreign judge. After yesterday's ruling
against the United Kingdom there will probably be many aspiring Tells
demanding a stand against the European Court of Human Rights.
They will be wasting their breath. There is no chance of Britain
pulling out of the Council of Europe under whose aegis the court
operates.
It might help to point out immediately that the European Court of
Human Rights is based in Strasbourg in France and has nothing whatever
to do with the European Court of Justice which is based in Luxembourg
and is an institution of the European Union.
Yesterday's judgment, however shocking to some ears, was not political
in any overt sense and Britain's membership of the EU is, therefore, not
an issue except in a wildy broad interpretation.
Britain, like all EU countries and others outside the EU, is bound by
the judgments of the court which was set up under the European
Convention of Human Rights. The convention was signed in 1950 after it
was agreed by Council of Europe, founded the year before.
This puts Britain currently in company with 35 other European
countries from San Marino to Germany (Ukraine has just been accepted and
will join soon and the Holy See is an observer) all of whom are sworn to
respect the court's findings.
Britain must therefore bow before European law -- again -- while
indignant Ministers seek comfort in the fact that the ruling means
little in practical terms.
As the deputy prime minister, Michael Heseltine, indicated, Britain
will simply do nothing -- although the usual suspects among the
Europhobes will sulk.
Through the court, the Council of Europe has been credited with making
important advances over the years in the protection of human rights.
States or private individuals who feel themselves let down by the
justice system in their own countries can take their cases to the last
resort in Strasbourg.
The Commission of Human Rights, the level below the court, acts as a
filter, examining their admissibility. An application is admissible only
after all forms of domestic remedy have been tried. Once a case has
passed the to court, the findings of the judges are binding on all
parties.
The Gibraltar case is remarkable firstly because the judges departed
from the norm by overturning the views of the commission which last year
expressed the opinion that Britain had not violated Article 2 of the
convention. The commissioners favoured Britain's argument by 11 votes to
six. The six included the Irish commissioner. When the case came before
the judges, there was no Irish presence on the Bench.
Sir John Freeland, the British judge, supported Britain's case along
with the Norwegian president of the court and a German, Icelander, Turk,
Swede, Finn, Hungarian, and Slovenian. Together they signed a dissenting
opinion.
Europe is fast becoming the last refuge of dissatisfied British
litigants to the annoyance of British judges, notably on the Scottish
Bench, who grumble at their findings increasingly being overturned.
Senior lawyers such as the Lord Chancellor and the Lord President,
Lord Hope, are known to see the advantages of writing the Convention on
Human Rights into domestic law but shy from the idea because it is a hot
political issue. Britain and Ireland remain the only two members of the
Council of Europe to stand back in this way -- and thus invite adverse
judgments on themselves.
Without the Strasbourg court, British prisoners would not enjoy the
right to consult a lawyer or start criminal proceedings without having
to petition the Home Secretary or Scottish Secretary. That was decided
in Strasbourg in 1975.
Birching was outlawed in the Isle of Man three years later and in the
early 1980s the complaints of two Scottish mothers led to the end of the
belt in state schools. The court ruled that while belting was not
degrading, the authorities had failed to respect the philosophical
convictions of parents opposed to corporal punishment.
The court also tightened the state's right to tap telephones and found
that Britain had violated freedom of expression by stopping newspapers
publishing extracts from Spycatcher, the memoirs of a mad British
intelligence officer.
Strasbourg judges stopped a number of interrogation techniques in
Northern Ireland after the Irish government brought a case alleging
torture and inhuman treatment.
In other cases it has found no British breach of human rights. The
Duke of Westminster, one of Britain's wealthiest men, failed to get the
court to find against the Leasehold Reform Act. Sir William Lithgow did
not succeed in challenging compensation paid to shipyard owners by the
Labour government after nationalisation.
The Fayeed brothers failed in their bid to challenge the DTI
inspectors during the Harrods take-over row with Tiny Rowland. Two
British sex change citizens were refused permission by Strasbourg to
alter their birth certificates so that they could marry.
In the Death on the Rock case the British Establishment -- courts,
Conservative politicians and the armed services -- fell foul of Article
2 which, according to the court, ''ranks as one of the most fundamental
provisions in the convention.''
Article 2 states: ''Everyone's right to life shall be protected by
law. No-one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the
execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime
for which this penalty is provided by law.''
It goes on to state the ''deprivation of life shall not be regarded as
inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use
of force which is no more than absolutely necessary''.
Plainly the judges were divided and uncertain about finding against
Britain because of the nature and evil intentions of a group of known
IRA terrorists. But in the end they decided, narrowly, that SAS
execution-style killings were a violation of the right to life, even in
such provocative circumstances, and that a major European democracy
should have known it.
Their judgment will cause ructions because of the principle involved
in the fight against terrorism. The fact that the court also withheld
compensation speaks volumes. After all the fuss has died down nothing
much will have changed.

<HEADLINE>Blaze woman loses court action against fire board</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976158993</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WIDOW who saw her timber house burn down has lost a legal bid to
claim that the part-time firefighters who attended the blaze were
negligent.
Mrs Sheila Duff, 61, raised an action for #34,000 damages against
Highland and Islands Fire Board at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.
Firefighters were called to a chimney fire at a neighbouring home to
Mrs Duff's and left believing it had been extinguished.
While returning to base the firefighters were called back to the
neighbour's home because smoke and flames had been discovered in a
bedroom.
But the blaze flared again, spread to Mrs Duff's home and destroyed
it.
Mrs Duff and her late husband, Kenneth, had rented the semi-detached
Forestry Commission house at Inchree, Onich, in Inverness-shire, for
many years. Then, six months before the October 1986 blaze, they bought
the property.
In a written judgement issued yesterday Lord Macfadyen said that, like
most Forestry Commission houses, the homes were constructed principally
of timber. They were joined by a brick gable, which housed the chimney
stack.
After the blaze it was found that a hole in the mortar of the
brickwork at the chimney flue had allowed hot gases to escape and ignite
the timber.
It was alleged Mrs Duff's neighbour, Mr John Critch, had alerted
firemen to smoke in his bedroom before they left the scene and that they
should have investigated its source.
The fire board disputed the claims and denied liability in the action.
There was evidence that after they contained the initial outbreak the
walls of Mr Critch's bedroom had been checked more than once for ''hot
spots'' but nothing had been found.
Experts explained that the heat from any lingering fire beneath the
floor of the bedroom might not have been detectable by such checking.
Lord Macfadyen said: ''It is in my opinion clear that the firefighters
left Inchree, having extinguished the original chimney fire, but without
extinguishing a pocket of combustion in the space between the living
room ceiling and the bedroom door.''
The judge decided that it was not the firefighters' fault that the
continuing combustion went undetected.
Mrs Duff's home has been rebuilt since the blaze.

SMALL businesses yesterday launched a campaign against metrication law
due to come into force on Sunday abolishing imperial measures in shops.
The Scottish secretary of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mr Bill
Anderson, called upon the Government to allow shopkeepers to continue to
sell goods in pints and pounds.
And he predicted that if supermarkets moved over to metric
exclusively, elderly customers might switch to corner shops prepared to
operate both systems.
The federation, which has 75,000 members throughout Britain, wants
shopkeepers to be given the choice of dealing in metric or imperial
measures, and opposes fines of up to #5000 for those breaching the new
law.
A typical small shop would have to spend an extra #3000 changing
tills, price lists and weighing machines, which could be enough to make
them go bust, said Mr Anderson.
He added: ''There is a feeling in Scotland that we are probably better
able to cope because we were taught the metric system at school
alongside the imperial system.
''However, the whole thing has been dictatorial. There has been a lack
of consultation with business and also a lack of consideration,
particularly for the older consumer.''

SCOTLAND'S 20,000 registered charities are losing out to rogue
charities and the National Lottery, it was claimed yesterday when an
independent commission to look into how charities should be run was
launched in Glasgow.
However, no-one was able to put a figure on the annual losses being
experienced by charities in Scotland -- the UK figure is about #40m a
year.
The commission, set up by the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations, will include MPs, businessmen and academics, and will be
chaired by Mr Arnold Kemp, the former editor of The Herald.
It will look at such questions as:
* Should charitable status, with its tax privileges, be redefined and
who should qualify.
* Should it include fee-paying schools, NHS trusts or universities.
* How will the sector fund its future.
Mr Kemp said: ''It is a matter of some concern that rogue charities
are taking revenue from genuine ones. Perhaps there may be a case for a
centralised dispersing of funds.''
He added that Scottish charities received about #30m a year from the
lottery.
Mr Roger Kent, of the SCVO, said charities in the UK were losing about
#40m a year, but could not put a figure on losses to Scots charities
caused by the lottery and bogus charities.

A DIRECTOR of the company which is trying to run a car ferry service
to Skye admitted yesterday that it will not have a vessel in time for
the toll bridge opening in less than three weeks, but insisted the plan
was not dead.
Mr Peter Findlay, a director of the Skye Boat Company, said yesterday:
''I would have to admit that it looks as though we will not have a
ferry.
''We went down to see Western Ferries last week and they were
interested and had a good look into it. Unfortunately their ferries are
for linkspans and not slipways as we have on the Kyle of Lochalsh.''
Mr Findlay said that it would have cost about #50,000 to adapt a
Western Ferries vessel for use in the Kyle which was too much for the
company to consider in the time allowed. They had other difficulties to
overcome.
''The big problem is that Highland region and the Scottish Office seem
to be doing everything in their power to prevent us operating a ferry.
We have got to come to some agreement with Highland region over the use
of the slipways and they are talking about #60,000.''
Mr Findlay said that the announcement of the toll levels for the
bridge, and the fact that motorists could get over for #2.44 when they
got the discount of buying a book of 10 tickets, also complicated
things. ''It would be very difficult to beat that level of charge in a
commerical operation which was also paying large dues for the slipway.''
He insisted, however, that the project was not dead and that they were
continuing to look for other vessels and examine other options. One
associated idea was to link in with the railways and in the summer run a
high-speed catamaran linking the railheads in Mallaig and Kyle with
Portree.
Meanwhile, Highland Regional Council said yesterday that it would not
be mounting a legal challenge to try to prevent the withdrawal of the
current CalMac ferry to Skye until a public inquiry had been held.
The Skye Bridge Appeal Group had written to the council convener, Mr
Duncan McPherson congratulating him and his councillors on their success
in saving the Fort William sleeper and asking him to take the same
stance on the Skye ferry.
Meanwhile, the Railways Users Consultative Committee for Scotland,
which also represents ferry users, is currently receiving
representations from the public over the withdrawal of the Skye ferry
and will decide later whether or not to call a public inquiry.
A 10-year-old boy from Ratagan, Kintail, has won a schools competition
to open the Skye bridge.Steven Campbell, with Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth at his side, will cut the ribbon on October 16.

A SURVIVAL guide to help doctors out of tricky confrontations with
aggressive patients was launched yesterday by the British Medical
Association.
The 79-page pack, Handling Aggression and Violence in Health Services,
was produced amid growing evidence of doctors being assaulted and
verbally abused in surgeries and hospitals.
A recent report in the medical journal Pulse said 25% of inner-city
GPs had been assaulted in their surgeries.
The guide is intended to be used for one-hour classes for doctors and
other health workers to help them avoid or defuse potentially violent
situations. The BMA hopes that health boards and trusts will buy the #95
pack and set aside time to follow its programme.
Dr Brian Potter, Scottish Secretary of the BMA, said: ''The fear of
violence can be more damaging than the violence itself, which is still
fairly unusual among the thousands of patient consultations that take
place every day throughout the UK, and we hope the pack will give health
care workers the chance to look at this fear itself and give them
mechanisms for coping with it.''
Examples cited yesterday by Dr Potter and his colleagues included:
* Urine thrown over a woman doctor.
* A doctor, seven months' pregnant, pushed down a flight of stairs --
she saved herself by grabbing a handrail.
* A doctor attending a house call forcibly detained and threatened
with the aim of getting him to write a prescription for drugs -- he got
out by calling the police on his mobile phone.
* A receptionist who had something thrown at her by a female patient
after explaining that appointments were running 15 minutes late.
''If someone is intent on violence then, apart from working in a steel
cage, there is not much you can do to prevent it, but in many cases the
episode works itself up,'' Dr Potter said.
''We should not be surprised -- medical practice is dealing with some
pretty raw and traumatic things that are happening to individuals, and
anger is often part of it.''
''It is only the really serious cases that get reported -- there is a
lower level of violence and aggression that we don't get to hear
about.'' Dr Mary Church, from Blantyre, a GP for 15 years, said that,
when she started practising, there was no threat of violence or
aggression during a consultation.
''Now there are times when you do feel uncomfortable, and you have to
recognise that these situations are developing and try to defuse them so
that they do not develop beyond what is simply an unpleasant
interview,'' she said.
A colleague of Dr Church, Airdrie GP Dr Donald MacKay, 56, had no such
opportunity last October when the brother of one of his patients --
nursing a sense of grievance over her death -- burst into his surgery
and knifed him to death.
In 1990, a balding female patient attacked another Airdrie GP, Dr John
Lwanda, with a knife because he had refused to prescribe a wig for her.
He was left with head injuries and a gashed arm.
''It still haunts me, and the scar still itches,'' he said yesterday.
''Preventing these attacks is certainly the best approach, although I
had very little time myself to do anything about it.''
Refusal to grant patients' demands is a frequent source of trouble, Dr
Church said.
''It is often people you are not familiar with, wanting a certain line
of medication you feel is not appropriate, and they can be resistant to
your advice; it is a matter of trying to persuade them that what they
want is not necessarily the best thing for them.''
Patients apart, doctors on night calls are frequently prey to
attackers intent on stealing drugs; the BMA's advice is to cut and run,
taking self-defensive action as a last resort.

THE directors of a Scottish company face possible court proceedings
after bulldozers demolished a listed building without permission.
Only a few weeks earlier, Glasgow's building control department met
with representatives of the What Everyone Wants group. Council officials
at that meeting emphasised that the listed building at Spreull's Court
in the city centre could not be touched by anyone without a specific
warrant.
The project managers, MPM Adams, yesterday blamed demolition
contractors for knocking the building down by mistake.
Mr David Adams, managing director of Glasgow-based MPM Adams, said
neither his company nor WEW authorised the demolition work. He added
that an internal investigation was currently being carried out.
He said the contractors were supervised by engineers, but not on a
daily basis.
Mr Adams said it was too early to say if legal action would be taken
against the contractors but added that every effort would be made to
establish responsibility.
The B-listed building which disappeared in a mass of rubble was
Spreull's Court which lay behind Glassford Street. It was built
originally, about 1775, as a house for a rich merchant.
Its historic value only surfaced when developers started showing
interest, about 10 years ago, in redeveloping the whole area bounded by
Glassford Street, Wilson Street and Hutcheson Street.
In 1991 planning permission was granted for an #8m redevelopment. The
scheme involved maintaining the facade of part of Glassford Street. And
a key condition was that Spreull's Court, latterly used as warehouse
space, should be taken down with each stone numbered and the old house
then rebuilt and restored as an architectural feature of a new courtyard
within the development.
The Glasgow contractors were not available for comment last night.

THE European Commission appears to have resurrected a plan to impose
expensive hygiene checks on fishing boats, long after the idea was
believed to have been killed off by hostility from Scottish Euro-MPs.
According to a letter from farm commissioner Franz Fischler to
Labour's Hugh McMahon, whose Strathclyde West constituency includes
Clyde fishing ports, the planned fees ''are not excessive or
disproportionate''.
However, Mr McMahon last night expressed alarm that the idea had been
revived by the Commission and said he would fight it in the European
Parliament.
''We were assured by the Commission when this raised its head a few
months ago that the idea was being dropped. Now it seems someone has had
a change of mind or has been badly briefed,'' he said.
The SNP's Dr Allan Macartney, who represents the North-east Scotland
fishing constituencies, called for an inquiry into the suggestion.
Earlier this year he won the backing of the European Parliament's
fisheries committee in opposing the plan which, it was estimated, would
cost the Scottish fishing industry #4m a year.
Mr Fischler's letter talks of proposed charges of one Ecu (80p) per
tonne on landing or first sale, the same for the ''inspection of
establishments'' (which are not defined) and the same for checking
products imported at a frontier post.
Earlier this year Mr Fischler announced that he was proposing a new
fishery products directive which would subject fish catches to hygiene
checks which are already carried out free in the United Kingdom.
Mr Peter Crampton, Labour's Euro-spokesman on fish, said at the time:
''Just because Germany charges its fishing industry for hygiene
inspections there is no reason to slap the same charge on everyone else.
The Commission's proposal will cost jobs, cut the prices paid to
fishermen and increase the price of fish in the supermarket. It will do
nothing to improve food hygiene.''
He accused the Commission of being ''underhand and secretive'' by not
first consulting the Parliament.
The idea was believed to be dead after Euro-MPs from all parties
united in opposition at the plan to treat fish catches under rules used
for checking meat and poultry.
The Scottish fishing industry, already in trouble because of dwindling
stocks and facing competition from more Spanish and Portuguese boats
next year, would have been particularly affected by the charges.

<HEADLINE>Census reveals main denominations in Scotland losing a congregation every week. Churchgoing falls by 85, 000</HEADLINE>

CHURCH attendance in Scotland has fallen by 85,000 in a decade,
according to the Scottish Church Census, presenting a challenge to all
denominations.
The 1994 census of all Christian churches showed that only one in
seven adults went to church on October 30, the sample day, compared with
one in six in 1984.
The combined strength of the two largest denominations, the Church of
Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church, fell from 84% of Scottish
churchgoers in 1984 to 81% last year.
The report of the census, unveiled in Edinburgh, said 575,000 adults
and 171,000 children (aged under 15) were in church on census Sunday, or
just 14% of the adult population and 18% of children, compared with 17%
of adults and 19% of children 10 years earlier.
Dr Peter Brierley, executive director of Christian Research, who
conducted the census, covering 4200 churches, called the drop in
attendance ''potentially catastrophic''. He said: ''The future of the
Church in Scotland depends on how churches and individuals react to
these results.''
Dr Brierley said the decline since 1984 was the equivalent of losing
225 people a week. The average Sunday congregation of adults and
children was 222, so Scotland was losing the equivalent of a
congregation every week.
The loss of members breaks down by denomination as 47,500 from the
Church of Scotland (down 18%); 41,000 from the Roman Catholic church
(down 14%); 5500 from other Presbyterians (down 23%); and 3000 from the
Baptists (down 14%).
This was offset by a growth of 7500 members in independent churches
(up 28%), 3500 in other churches (up 18%), and 500 in the Scottish
Episcopal Church (up 3%).
The report said there had been a huge haemorrhage of young people; 34%
of children below nine, and 48% of those aged between 10-19 in 1984 had
stopped attending church by 1994.
Dr Brierley added that there was cause for acute concern that young
people were opting out of church life in Scotland so rapidly. The teens
to twenties drop was identical to that found in the 1989 English Church
Census.
However, the ''good news'', the report said, was that the percentage
of adults attending church in Scotland was still higher than in England
(10% in 1989).
Only the charismatic evangelical churches had seen growth in the
1990s. Overall 17% of churches had attendances grow at least 20% between
1990 and 1994, while 6% saw declines and 77% experienced no change.
In 1994, independent churches had 34,600 members, other churches
22,400, and the Episcopal Church 16,300. The other churches' growth was
due to the Pentecostal churches and seven local ecumenical projects, the
report said. Among the independent churches, most growth was in the new
(or House) churches.
Another piece of ''good news'' was that the percentage of men in
church increased from 37% in 1984 to 39% in 1994. The Roman Catholic
percentage stayed the same, at 43%, but the independent churches saw an
increase from 40% in 1984 to 43% in 1994.
A surprising 14% of churchgoers attended twice on a Sunday compared
with 13% in 1984 but this varied greatly by denomination.
The response of Scottish church representatives yesterday was to see
the census as a spur for change rather than a cause for gloom.
The Rev Fergus Macdonald, general secretary of the National Bible
Society of Scotland, said the churches were presented with a challenge
to break out of their establishment mode and become centres of a deep
Christian spirituality.
The Right Rev James Harkness, Moderator of the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland, rejected Dr Brierley's ''catastrophic'' view without
minimising concern at the findings.
The Church had to go back to its roots and make sure of the way it was
going, learning from the past but looking to the future. It should
recover and recapture its basic confidence.
Mr Harkness said a great deal of work was going on in Scotland to
attract people to church, and he instanced an initiative in
Aberdeenshire where members were calling from door to door. This was one
method that could be used.
Bishop Joseph Devine of Motherwell, president of the Roman Catholic
communications commission, said that the 745,000 people who attended
church was more than the 100,000 people who attended football matches in
Scotland last Saturday.

THE Burns International Festival was yesterday given the royal seal of
approval.
Braving a torrential downpour the Princess Royal, president of next
year's festival, carried out the official launch by unveiling a
specially commissioned statue of Robert Burns and his publisher John
Wilson at the Cross, Kilmarnock.
The bronze monument has been created by Alexander Stoddart as part of
the regeneration of the town centre.
The Princess spent time admiring the work before moving on to the
Grand Hall to meet festival patrons and accept a donation to the
Princess Royal Trust for Carers.
She said: ''It is entirely fitting that this statue should stand so
near to where the Kilmarnock edition was published.
''I wish the Burns International Festival well and feel sure that it
will help in your efforts to boost the economy and tourism in this
area.''
The festival will mark the bicentenary of the bard's death. Its
director, Mr John Struthers, said that more than #150,000 of sponsorship
has been secured from major Scottish companies.
Mr Struthers said that by the end of this year a package of almost #1m
from public and private sources will be in place which will allow a
programme of events to go ahead.
Mr Struthers stressed: ''We have had criticism in the past, much of it
justified, but now we are moving forward.''
At a meeting in Glasgow later the Princess Royal said there was
''considerable scope for improvement'' in the treatment given to victims
of crime in Scotland,
Addressing Victim Support Scotland's 10th anniversary agm, of which
she is patron, the Princess said: ''The service and support given to
victims of crime could be improved. Communication and information is
ultimately important.''
She praised the charity, which has aided 180,000 people in Scotland
since its inception, adding: ''The demands on the police have changed
over the years so that it has become virtually impossible for them to
provide the service and support victims want.

AN industrial tribunal into the sacking of Lochaber District Council's
chief executive was told yesterday that there was no job for him even if
reinstatement were ordered.
The council chairman, Councillor Neil Clark, when asked about the
possibility of Mr David Blair getting his job back, said it had been
filled and there were no suitable vacancies for the former chief
executive.
If reinstatement were ordered, he said, it would be a ''totally
impossible situation''.
''With all the things that have taken place over the last year there
are so many entrenched positions. There is certainly no way Mr Blair
could find a working relationship with the councillors.''
Asked why Mr Blair was suspended on September 13, 1994, Councillor
Clark said: ''There had been maladministration somewhere in the council.
I don't think that can be denied. The head of administration had to
accept responsibility.
''If there was maladministration in the council it would be silly for
the council to allow that situation to remain by leaving him in his
post.''
Asked who was responsible for Lochaber council's insurance, Councillor
Clark told the tribunal: ''The chief executive's department.''
A council internal audit report had noted Mallaig swimming pool wasn't
covered, there were items which shouldn't be included, and aspects of
the motor vehicle insurance seemed unclear.
The tribunal continues today.

BRIAN MacKinnon, the 32-year-old who lived a double life as a
schoolboy to try to restart his medical studies, voluntarily met
officers from Strathclyde Police yesterday.
The meeting at Milngavie police station lasted just over an hour. It
was called to allow Mr MacKinnon to answer questions raised by the press
coverage of the discovery that he had masqueraded as ''Brandon Lee'' to
retake his Highers at Bearsden Academy. Mr MacKinnon was not charged.
''There have been claims in the press that I have two passports and
was involved in a bar-room brawl in Tenerife,'' said Mr MacKinnon last
night. ''Obviously the police wanted to ask me about that. I was happy
to oblige and set the record straight.
''The meeting was amicable and straightforward. I also told the police
that, while at Dundee University last year studying medicine, I received
no grant or financial aid of any kind.''
He added: ''The police were very polite, and when the meeting ended
said they would inform me of the outcome of their inquiries.''
Meanwhile, Dundee University confirmed that a letter of explanation
and apology from Mr MacKinnon -- which The Herald delivered to the
Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry on Tuesday -- would be considered by
the student progress committee this morning.
A statement said the committee would decide on his future at the
university and would send a letter to him this afternoon, with the
decision being made public tomorrow.
Dr Brian Potter, Scottish secretary of the British Medical
Association, yesterday expressed sympathy with Mr MacKinnon's plight and
said he hoped Dundee University would ''take a broad view'' in
considering whether to take him back.
''Practising as a doctor, you have to have a high level of integrity
and trustworthiness, but I would hate to see someone with such a
compelling urge to be a doctor barred because it had led him to enter
this subterfuge,'' he said.
However, a contemporary of Mr MacKinnon's at Glasgow University said
last night that the dons there may have done him a favour by excluding
him from the course.
Glasgow GP Dr John McKinnon revealed that one, possibly two, students
from that year had committed suicide after being exposed to the
sink-or-swim rigours of a hospital residence post.

IDENTITY cards should be subject to ''a realistic appraisal'' of their
benefits and dangers, the Scottish Consumer Council said yesterday.
The consumer watchdog said ID cards should only be brought in if there
are clear, unequivocal benefits for individuals and society.
In a response to the Government's Green Paper published earlier this
year on the possible introduction of ID cards, the SCC said it was
concerned the cards would permit the abuse of personal information.
''In general consumers are happy to trade information about themselves
for access to goods and services,'' said chairwoman Mrs Deirdre Hutton.
''But they should not be expected to trade information without knowing
the reasons for it and the use to which the information may be put.''
The SCC said the question of whether ID cards should be introduced in
the UK was a serious issue for everyone.
''We have studied the proposals carefully and have concluded the
potential benefits are seriously undermined by potential problems of
misuse of information and security,'' said Mrs Hutton.
The SCC said it was worried information could be accessed and abused
by credit reference agencies or debt collectors.

A MARTIAL arts expert who lured two young girls to his flat before
indecently assaulting them has been jailed for 30 months.
Alexander Muir, 30, locked the friends, aged 13 and 14, in his flat
then made them take their trousers off and join him in bed, the High
Court in Kilmarnock heard.
The offences came to light when the weeping younger girl told a
teacher that Muir, a family friend and drummer in a rock band, had made
them ''dog off'' school and go to his Ayrshire flat.
The court heard that Muir ordered the youngsters, who cannot be named,
to decide who would have sex with him first.
He sang and played guitar while they made up their minds.
The 14-year-old told advocate-depute Andrew Lamb: ''He had no clothes
on. He was grabbing and trying to pull my pants down.
''I was crying and he said I was leading him on. He said I had the
body of a woman but was acting like a two-year-old. I went to the front
door but it was locked.''
She added: ''At one point I was screaming at him. I was swearing at
him, saying he was nothing but a bastard.''
A teacher said in evidence that the girls had come to her at lunchtime
on the day of the offences last June 15. ''They told me I didn't know
him; I wouldn't understand their fear of him,'' she said.
Jailing Muir, Lord McCluskey said: ''I have to impose a sentence of
imprisonment in each case.'' He ordered that he should serve 30 months
on each charge, to run concurrently.

SIR John Orr, the often outspoken former Chief Constable of Lothian
and Borders Police, has died at his Edinburgh home after a short
illness. He was 77.
Sir John headed Scotland's second largest police force for an
eight-year period during which, on a number of occasions, he voiced his
concerns publicly about law and order and the state of the country's
legal system.
Last night tributes were paid to Sir John who, as well as having a
distinguished police career, was also a prominent figure in Scottish
rugby. Capped twice for his country he was a past president of the
Scottish Rugby Union.

SIXTY-one Gulf war ''human shield'' hostages have sued British Airways
for landing them in Kuwait on the day of the Iraqi invasion five years
ago.
They have accused the airline of maintaining the Kuwait stopover of
their London to Kuala Lumpur flight in order to land British secret
agents, even though it knew the Iraqi invasion had started. The damages
claim was lodged in a Paris court.
BA flight 149, with 364 passengers on board, landed at Kuwait airport
early on August 2, 1990. The jet was seized by Iraqi soldiers and the
passengers were held hostage for three months, some of them being used
as human shields against allied bombing of Iraqi strategic targets.
The plaintiffs, French nationals and foreign residents in France, say
elite British SAS commandos boarded the flight at the last minute in
London and the plane landed in Kuwait to drop them off.
They demand that the airline recognise its responsibility and pay
compensation for mental anguish.
British Airways has denied the charge, and similar lawsuits in England
and Scotland have been rejected. The matter is due to go to the House of
Lords in the autumn.
An airline spokeswoman said the airline was not aware at the time that
hostilities had broken out and was not liable.
''Whilst we of course sympathise, we, including our crew, were as much
victims as anybody else,'' she said.
Frenchwoman Monique Merlet, who was held as a human shield in a
factory with her husband and two teenage children, said they had lost 15
kilos (33lb) by the time they were freed.
''My son tried to commit suicide. We were walking corpses. All we had
every day was a bowl of rice and some hot water,'' she said.
The French Government, which has compensated the former hostages for
their ordeal, joined the plaintiffs in demanding that the airline
reimburse their payments.

THE Princess of Wales turned poet yesterday to poke fun at the press.
Speaking at a London literary lunch, the princess joked she had made
time ''between therapy sessions and secret trysts'' to compose her verse
and answer her critics.
She told guests at the Literary Review lunch, hosted by writer Auberon
''Bron'' Waugh, how she felt very privileged to be allowed to join ''a
highly exclusive gathering of intellects''.
''Apparently, some people are wondering what Diana, that notorious
illiterate, is doing at a distinguished scholarly occasion such as
this,'' she said.
''So I've made time between therapy sessions and secret trysts to
attempt to reply.''
Then, to applause and laughter, the princess read her poem:
''The princess was heard to declare,
Let gossips poke fun if they dare.
My real inspiration
is Bron's invitation,
Stick that in your tabloids, so there.''
Guests at the Cafe Royal lunch included Lord Rothermere, Sir Tim Rice,
William Rushton, Harry Enfield, Dominic Lawson, Alexander Chancellor,
Lynn Barber, Lord Gowrie and the Duke of Devonshire.
The princess, wearing a bright red suit with an above-the-knee skirt,
was presenting the Literary Review annual grand poetry prize, sponsored
by the Mail on Sunday, to poet Richard Charles.
It was the second of three official engagements this week for the
princess who appears to be gradually increasing her public appearances.
Hundreds of onlookers waited in the rain for a glimpse of the princess
when she arrived in London's Regent Street.
The Princess visits RAF Wittering, Cambridgeshire, today in her role
as honorary Air Commodore.
On Tuesday she returned from an overnight trip to Paris where she met
French President Jacques Chirac and helped raise one million francs
(#130,000) for London's Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital at a
celebrity dinner.

THE craft of making things, the business of doing . . . these were the
imperatives that ignited Jean Muir, who died in May aged 66, and they
were the qualities her friends recalled at yesterday's memorial service
at St George's Church in London's Hanover Square.
The congregation reflected Jean Muir's breadth of interest and appeal.
Baroness Thatcher was there among diplomats, actors, writers, models,
designer colleagues, retailers, and the pins-and-needles people whose
skill is the backbone of the rag trade.
The Rev W M Atkins, rector of St George's, remembered that she
preferred to be known as a dressmaker.
Actress Joanna Lumley recalled her earliest modelling days as a
''Muirette'', when Miss Muir would subtly demonstrate the drama of
simplicity.
Lady Antonia Fraser read from T S Eliot 's The Rock and the
congregation sang John Bunyan's Pilgrim hymn. And jazz musician Bobby
Short sang T'ain't What You Do, It's The Way That You Do It. A fitting
epitaph.

DISGRACED Olympic coach Paul Hickson was the man behind Britain's
glittering swimming success at the Seoul Games.
His record-breaking 1988 squad had seven Olympic finalists, and
included stars like Adrian Moorhouse and Nick Gillingham, who scooped
three golds, silver and bronze medals.
As schools' swimming co-ordinator in Norfolk, he developed
international competitors like David Stacey, Karen Mellor and Paul
Easter.
But today that illustrious career is in ruins amid the shame of his
secret years of sex assaults on young female athletes.
An alert off-duty policeman finally exposed the ordeal young swimmers
were suffering at Hickson's hands.
Leicester-born Hickson, a former county swimming champion, became
Britain's best-known figure in the sport after his promotion to chief
coach for the Seoul Olympics.
Hickson's work as chief national coach began in 1985 with the European
Championships, and later included World and Commonwealth championships.
But despite his achievements at the Seoul Games, he was unexpectedly
axed by the Great Britain swimming committee in late 1988.
At the time, he claimed he had been given ''no real reason'' for the
change.
In 1983 he joined University College, Swansea, as assistant director
of PE.
It was there that much of the sexual abuse was carried out on young
swimmers who joined his advance training squad.
He left Swansea in the autumn of 1991 to become head of PE at the top
Millfield public school in Somerset.
Married for 26 years, he and biology teacher wife Kathleen were also
appointed assistant house parents to girl pupils.
A year later, he was suspended from the school and later sacked after
being arrested by South Wales detectives investigating indecency
allegations made by eight former members of his Swansea advanced
training squad.
But while awaiting his September 1993 trial at Swansea Crown Court,
Hickson absconded to Lille in northern France, where he held a job
teaching English to businessmen.
After detectives made appeals for information and showed his
photograph on BBC TV's Crimewatch, other former swimmers came forward
with allegations which led to further charges.
South Wales police made worldwide inquiries to trace him and the
shamed coach was rearrested in Sherwood Forest after 15 months on the
run.
Police had been tipped off when Hickson arrived in a French-registered
car at the Center Parcs leisure complex in Sherwood Forest,
Nottinghamshire, where he planned to spend Christmas with his family.
In court, Hickson claimed he stayed in France to earn money to support
his wife Kathleen and daughter Amy, 8, who lived near Glastonbury.
He was also concerned that defence lawyers did not have enough time to
prepare his case.
His escape, recapture, trial and subsequent imprisonment all came
about after a South Wales police officer, attending a social event,
heard rumours about the coach's perverted behaviour.
He wrote a report to senior officers, naming four young women as
possible contacts.
He had personal reasons to be concerned, because his own sports-mad
daughter, a promising swimmer, was at one time in Hickson's advanced
training squad.
His report was followed up by a team of detectives, who began
extensive but discreet inquiries.
Over the next few months, officers unravelled a grotesque catalogue of
indecency and sex attacks, spread over a 15-year period beginning in
1976.
Mr Wyn Williams QC, who prosecuted at Cardiff Crown Court, told the
jury: ''This is a classic case of a person in authority abusing their
position.''
The three-week trial heard from 13 women who came forward to accuse
Hickson of sexual assaults while they were at school or college.
He denied two charges of rape, 13 indecent assaults and two further
serious sexual offences.
Nine complainants gave evidence of his indecency during the unorthodox
''fitness and fatness'' tests he devised at University College, Swansea,
where he was assistant director of Physical Education.
He used to order them to take off their bikini tops or bras before
touching their breasts and committing other assaults.
A former national champion recalled how Hickson sexually attacked her
when she was 16, while giving massages for a muscle injury. She said the
coach also attacked her in a hotel bedroom after a swimming competition
in Barnet, north London.
The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said she did
not tell her parents because she was afraid her career would be
finished: ''My swimming meant everything. If I had told my father, I
would not have had Mr Hickson as a coach any more.
''I was the best in the country, my swimming was improving. I just
thought it would not happen again. In my eyes he was brilliant and I
respected him.''
A 14-year-old who endured his assaults said she was too frightened to
complain because he threatened to spread untrue rumours that she was
having sex with her boyfriend.
Another top swimmer said that, when she was 15, he tried to rape her
on a changing-room table before committing another sexual act against
her.
She was left too dazed and frightened to tell anybody. ''He said that
I wasn't to tell anyone because I could get him into trouble. I didn't
want him to get into trouble.''
Another woman, now 32, described how Hickson frequently raped her at
his home during school lunch breaks -- the first time when she was 13.
The coach later persuaded her reluctant mother to put her on the Pill,
saying it would boost her swimming performance.
But the real reason, she said, was that Hickson could force her to
have sex whenever he wanted without her getting pregnant.
Another victim said: ''He seemed thoroughly respected by parents and
as a swimming coach I thought he was good. But the effect was that I
just hated going swimming.
''I thought it was just happening to me, I did not realise it was
happening all over the place.''

FOUR Scottish projects are among 40 from throughout the UK nominated
for Royal Institute of British Architects awards.
The refurbishment of the old Empire Theatre in Edinburgh designed by
architect Colin Ross was one of the top projects. Work on the 1928
building, now the Festival Theatre, was carried out by Bovis
Construction.
Alterations and an extension to a house in Edinburgh's Gilmour Road,
also won praise.
Another project was The White Top Centre, near Perth Road, Dundee,
which provides a day care and training unit for young handicapped
adults.
Ayrshire picked up a mention for the Harbourside development at Irvine
of 20 houses, designed by the development corporation.
All four projects go forward for the Building of the Year Award, which
will be announced in November.
Meanwhile, Gledswood, an 18th century mansion near Melrose, has won
the conservation prize in the Borders Regional Council Architectural
Awards.
Winner of the new building award was Glebe Court housing scheme in
Duns.

POLICE investigating last weekend's hoax letter-bomb incident at
Labour's headquarters in Glasgow are understood to have ruled out a link
with the recent campaign of intimidation by the Scottish National
Liberation Army.
The terrorist organisation has been implicated in a series of death
threats, letter-bombs and hoaxes -- two of its members being jailed at
the High Court in Stirling last month -- and a claim for last Saturday's
fake letter-bomb at Keir Hardie House was telephoned to a Sunday
newspaper.
The padded envelope, described by police as an elaborate hoax, had
been addressed to Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson. It was
said to contain cuttings from SNP leaflets and a direct threat against
Mr Robertson.
However, The Herald understands that Special Branch detectives who
examined the package have reached an early conclusion that it does not
fit the pattern of the SNLA campaign orchestrated by a Scottish exile
based in Dublin.
Meanwhile, yesterday the war of words between Labour and the SNP
continued in the wake of the weekend incident and the leak earlier last
week of an internal Labour memo suggesting that the threats and
intimidation represented the ''darker side of nationalism''.
Mr Robertson has suggested that emotive talk by SNP activists
employing language such as traitors, Quislings and Uncle Toms contribute
to such activity, but SNP leader Alex Salmond yesterday called for Mr
Robertson's resignation and said he was writing to Labour leader Tony
Blair about what he called a deliberate smear campaign.
Mr Salmond demanded three answers -- did Mr Robertson or a close
associate deliberately engineer the leak of his memo to undermine the
opening of the SNP annual conference? Did Labour tip-off the media about
Saturday's bomb hoax? And did Labour fuel coverage of that hoax by
putting out information withheld by the police?
He said that, if the answer to any of these three was yes, Mr
Robertson should resign as Shadow Scottish Secretary, and complained of
the ''smears and black arts which seem to be the stock-in-trade of New
Labour's spin doctors.''
Labour's Scottish general secretary, Jack McConnell, hit back with
three answers yesterday, saying: that they did not know who leaked the
memo; that they did not tip off the media on Saturday; and that he only
spoke to the press at the suggestion of police at the scene.

MPs may seek changes to the Treaty of Rome to protect Scottish
football in the wake of European Court of Justice findings that will
change the game forever if ratified.
Clubs face being prohibited from receiving transfer payments for
players whose contracts have expired, raising fears of dramatic cuts in
playing staffs, even closures, because so many rely on sales to keep
afloat.
The all-party Parliamentary Scottish Sports Group yesterday met the
Scottish Football Association and Scottish Football League to discuss
the implications of Advocate-General Carl Otto Lenz's rulings last week
on freedom of movement for players in Europe.
Mr Lenz has found that Article 48 of the Treaty of Rome should stop
clubs from being able to demand and receive payments for players engaged
by other clubs after their contracts had expired.
Sports group convener Denis Canavan said it would have repercussions
for small and medium-sized clubs who rely on transfer fees to meet their
running costs.
The Falkirk West Labour MP added that the ruling, even if endorsed in
November, will require the agreement of all member states at an
inter-government conference next year.
He planned to raise concerns with Government Ministers in the hope
that issues will be raised at the conference -- perhaps even with a view
to amending the Treaty of Rome.
SFA secretary Jim Farry acknowledged it was a tall order to change the
treaty, but added that it might be possible to obtain exemptions for
sport or create a special chapter for sport.

THE bitter war of words over opposition councillors' claims of
''Stalinist '' behaviour by the Labour leaders of the new Edinburgh
Council raged on in the city yesterday.
Council chairman Eric Milligan fired off a letter to Liberal Democrat
leader Donald Gorrie, accusing him of being ''abusive'',
''sanctimonious'' and ''self righteous''.
Councillor Gorrie had claimed Labour had behaved in a ''high-handed
and arrogant'' way over changing the dates of council meetings without
adequate notice. He also accused Labour of treating the new council like
its own private club.
Clearly angered by the criticisms of his approach to running the new
authority, Councillor Milligan has set out in detail in his letter why a
policy committee meeting was held this week instead of a full council
meeting.
He insisted only a possible date had been agreed for a council
meeting, and a policy committee was deemed adequate as the agenda was
light.
''It is clear nothing was done at variance with the council's decision
nor its standing orders which clearly allow the council's chairperson to
determine dates of meetings.
''On this basis, it is also clear to me that your abusive remarks
amount to nothing but hot air, they are mere puff, sanctimonious, self
righteous puff,'' said Councillor Milligan.
The row is expected to continue when the next meeting of the council
takes place at the end of October.
* Meanwhile moves to privatise Her Majesty's Stationery Office were
announced yesterday.
The department provides printing and publishing services, stationery
and office equipment to Parliament, Government departments and other
public sector customers.
One of its high-profile roles is the production of Hansard, the daily
official record of Parliament's proceedings.
Announcing the move at HMSO's headquarters in Norwich, Public Service
Minister Roger Freeman said he wanted to end ''uncertainty'' about
HMSO's future.
The HMSO is more than 200 years old, employs about 2800 staff, and has
an annual turnover of around #340m.

THE Labour left was in uproar last night after the party's National
Executive Committee voted to reject left-wing north London councillor
Liz Davies as a parliamentary candidate.
Ms Davies, who was seeking to stand for Leeds North East, became the
first selected parliamentary candidate to be rejected by the NEC for
eight years following allegations about her political activities and
far-left connections.
The NEC voted 17-5 to reject her as a candidate after a lengthy
discussion only a few days before Labour's annual conference opens in
Brighton.
Those who voted in her favour included Shadow Education Secretary
David Blunkett and senior MPs Joan Lestor and Dennis Skinner. Mrs
Margaret Beckett, Shadow Health spokesman and former deputy leader of
the party, abstained.
The move was yet another demonstration that Labour leader Tony Blair
is stamping his authority on the party, and came as he made it clear
that, as far as he is concerned, his party must continue to change if
Britain is to change.
In an interview with the House Magazine, Westminster's in-house
journal, he said: ''I do understand party members who feel that the last
year has been one of almost breathless change, but my judgment is that
we needed to make those changes in order to put the party's beliefs in a
modern setting.
''New Labour is not old left and not new right, it is a reinvigorated
party of the centre. It is a forward-looking alternative to the Tories,
a radical party that rejects some of the bureaucratic solutions of the
old left and the market dogma of the new right. New Labour reclaims
ground we should never have let go.''
The left, however, was outraged by the treatment of Ms Davies, and the
issue could well be raised at conference next week. Mr Skinner, MP for
Bolsover, said: ''This is a defining moment, and what has happened was
purely because she was on the left. She has been asked to jump through
hoops other people have not been asked to jump through.''
Ms Davies, a 31-year-old barrister, said: ''This is outrageous and
unjustifiable. This decision is the culmination of a campaign of dirty
tricks, lies, and smears orchestrated by the Labour leader's office and
carried out by a small clique in Islington. I will consider taking legal
action against anyone who has lied about me.''
Justifying the NEC decision, however, Labour's general secretary, Mr
Tom Sawyer, said the NEC had found ''fairly conclusively'' that she was
not a suitable Labour candidate.
This was based on a number of factors, including the numerous
occasions when she had not voted with her party as an Islington
councillor, taken as a sign she may not abide by the party Whip in
Parliament. There also was her failure to pay the poll tax, and her
position on the editorial board of Labour Briefing, a left-wing
pamphlet.
In his House Magazine interview, Mr Blair said people liked what they
saw of Labour, but it was necessary to deepen their commitment. He said:
''My judgment was that we did not need a series of minor adjustments,
but a quantum leap to make us electable.
''I wanted to continue the reforms, first made by Neil Kinnock and
then by John Smith, that took us away from the dark days of the early
1980s when, frankly, we were unelectable, to the position we are in
today.
''It is for others to judge if I am a nice guy. The British people
have had enough of rudderless, feeble leadership and want to feel they
know where they are going and that they do not have to settle for second
best.''
* Support for Labour has fallen to 51% -- the lowest since July last
year, when Tony Blair was elected party leader, according to a Mori poll
published in today's Times.

THE Conservative Party will have to produce new ideas and policies if
it is to convince the Scottish people that the Tories take Scotland
seriously, according to Mr James Mitchell, director of the terrestrial
politics research centre at Strathclyde University.
Speaking at the Unionist Scotland -- 1800 to 1995 conference at
Strathclyde University yesterday, Mr Mitchell said: ''It will take more
than Michael Forsyth wearing a kilt at the premiere of Braveheart to
change things.
''In the past, the Tories were seen as a Scottish party but they are
no longer regarded this way and they have got to do something.''
Mr Richard Finlay, a lecturer in Scottish history at Strathclyde
University, said earlier that the ''Thatcherite attack on consensus
values'' since 1979 had robbed the Scots of an acceptable vision of
Britain.
He said that, paradoxically, the upsurge in Scottish nationalism had
been fuelled by a desire to preserve what are fundamentally British
institutions, such as the health service.

OVER one third of a million people have not worked since 1992, when
John Major predicted that a Conservative election victory would mean
''continued recovery'', Labour claimed yesterday.
Labour employment spokesman Ian McCartney said that 337,622 had not
worked for more than three years, at a cost to the taxpayer of more than
#3000m in lost tax and benefits. At the time of the last election,
long-term unemployment stood at 208,849 -- some 128,773 less than the
latest available figures.
Over the same period, the number of long-term unemployed in Scotland
rose from 25,425 to 26,701.
Of those who have not worked since the Tory election victory, more
than 15,000 are aged under 25, many of whom have not worked since
leaving school said Mr McCartney.

FORMER Olympic coach Paul Hickson last night began a 17-year jail
sentence for sexually abusing young swimmers.
The sport's official body immediately promised parents that vetting
and supervision procedures for coaches would be reviewed in the light of
the case, which involved some of the country's most talented youngsters.
Hickson, 48, chief swim coach at the Seoul Games, was convicted at
Cardiff Crown Court of systematically preying on frightened teenage
girls whom he picked for his elite training squads at Norwich and
University College, Swansea.
The jury found him guilty of two rapes, two other serious sex
offences, and 11 indecent assaults on youngsters over a 15-year period.
Parents of some victims sobbed with relief at the verdicts.
Earlier, the court was told most of the girls had suffered in silence,
either through fear or because they thought Hickson would drop them from
top competitions if they spoke out.
Hickson, married with an eight-year-old daughter, showed no emotion as
Judge John Prosser described his crimes as ''dreadful, filthy, and
beastly''.
He said the coach, once internationally respected, had betrayed the
trust of parents and ruined the lives of his victims.
Some had borne pain, anguish and sorrow for nearly 20 years before
coming forward to give evidence of their ordeal.
Several young women told how Hickson sexually assaulted them after
swimming sessions or while carrying out fitness tests.
The court heard how Hickson later ordered one of his rape victims,
then 14, to go on the Pill, claiming it would improve her swimming
performance.
Outside court, one of the girls he indecently assaulted, said: ''Paul
Hickson put me through hell. Justice has been done and I'm very glad.''
A mother whose daughter was among the victims added: ''It was terrible
to find out he had been doing this for so long.
''The girls were dedicated swimmers and Hickson was a very powerful
figure in the swimming world. But he just completely abused the trust
people put in him. He has got the long sentence he deserves.''
Detective Inspector Bryan Jenkins of South Wales police led the
long-running inquiry. ''I am relieved for the victims who were the most
important people in this case,'' he said.
Police interviewed dozens of young swimmers in Hickson's squads,
including one former athlete traced in Australia. After studying a file
of statements, the Crown Prosecution Service decided to press charges on
17 alleged incidents between 1976 and 1991.
Hickson was cleared on two charges of indecent assault, against a
former Commonwealth Games swimmer and a 20-year-old Swansea University
undergraduate.
Mr David Sparkes, chief executive of the Amateur Swimming Federation
of Great Britain, last night said the body was ''extremely concerned''
that a coach appointed by the federation should be guilty of such
offences.
''Steps were taken some years ago to tighten our procedure regarding
the protection of swimmers, but in the light of this case we will
naturally look at whether further action should be taken to tighten our
vetting and supervision procedures.''
Mr Sparkes added: ''I would like to assure the parents of all swimmers
that we are very conscious of the fact that they pass on a big
responsibility to us and it is one which we never treat lightly.''

THE cost of flying between Scotland and London is to be slashed with a
new service from Prestwick Airport.
Ryanair, which already operates to Dublin from the Ayrshire airport,
will start a daily service to London Stansted from October 27.
Fares will start at #59 return rising to a fully flexible ticket at
#99 compared with a range of #74 to #234 from the established
Anglo-Scottish carriers.
Talk of a price war, mooted by Ryanair executives at a news conference
yesterday, was dismissed by rivals who said they had no plans to respond
with fare or frequency changes.
Mr Tim Jeans, chief executive of Ryanair UK, said his company would be
happy to start a price war if it led to better value for customers.
He added: ''We have the lowest cost base of any airline and we make no
bones about the fact that we offer a no-frills service.
''But we are convinced that there is a large number of passengers in
the leisure and business markets who want better value for money between
Scotland and London and that is what we will offer.''
The Ryanair flights will be operated, by GB Airways using Ryanair's
Boeing 737 aircraft and crews until the relevant air operators
certificate is obtained from the Civil Aviation Authority.
Mr Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the Ryanair parent company,
said: ''There were difficulties because until April 1997 there are
restrictions on routes within Europe.''
From October 27, Ryanair will operate four flights a day in each
direction with the first out of Stansted at 7am returning at 8.35am.
With the fast rail link to Liverpool Street station, being offered
until the end of the year at #7 return for Prestwick passengers, the
City of London can be reached by mid-morning.
In addition airport operators PIK has negotiated a deal which offers
free rail travel to and from any station in Scotland for Prestwick
passengers.
Airport chairman Matthew Hudson said: ''I don't think there is any
question that this is the most significant day for air travel between
Scotland and England.''
Mr O'Leary estimates that the initial split between traffic out of
Prestwick and out of London will be 60/40 in favour of the Scottish
airport.
Yesterday's announcement was welcomed by the five Ayrshire MPs and
Lord Younger of Prestwick sent a message of support from Boston where he
is leading a trade mission.
The #59 fare compares with lowest prices from British Airways, British
Midland and Air UK -- the only airline currently operating into Stansted
from Scotland -- of #74 which must be booked in advanced and involves a
Saturday night stay.
The maximum #99 from Ryanair, with total flexibility, compares with
#234 from the three major carriers.
Mr Alex Donald, general manager for Air UK in Scotland, said: ''We
have no plans to respond in any way to the introduction of the Ryanair
service. We believe that Ryanair operates in a different market and that
if it takes any passengers it will be from the train and bus
operators.''
British Airways spokesman Alan Solloway said: ''Among the many
differences between Ryanair and ourselves are 12 flights a day to
Heathrow, unrivalled connections in both directions using British
Airways and associated airlines, turn up and take off facility and
quality in-flight catering.''
A spokeswoman for British Midland, which also operates from Glasgow
and Edinburgh to Heathrow, said: ''We welcome competition on any route
as it will hopefully expand the market for everybody.''

FOUR people on the Falkland Islands last night were being questioned
over the disappearance there of a teenage Royal Marine 15 years ago.
Two middle-aged men were arrested in police raids on the islands
yesterday morning on suspicion of murdering 19-year-old Alan Addis.
The second arrests, believed to be two other men, were carried out
some hours later, a Falklands police spokesman said.
A team of four detectives from Devon and Cornwall are questioning the
four at a special detention facility set up at Mount Pleasant police
station.
The islands police called in the West Country force after a renewed
two-year investigation into the case.
Yesterday's arrests came little more than a week after police visited
the remote settlement of North Arm to trace the Marine's last movements.
Marine Addis vanished after going to a party at North Arm on August 8,
1980.
The case was reopened following a long campaign by the Marine's
53-year-old widowed mother Ann Addis, from Wrawby, Humberside.
Yesterday Mrs Addis said she was ''really pleased'' at the progress
made by police.
The Devon and Cornwall force's team on the islands is being led by
Detective Chief Inspector Bob Pennington, who earlier praised the
co-operation they had received from islanders.
Investigations were helped by repeat screenings on Falklands TV of an
emotional video appeal by Mrs Addis.
In it Mrs Addis, who has twice visited the Falklands, said she wanted
to end the ''living nightmare'' of her son's disappearance.
The body of Marine Addis, a member of a six-man party of Marines sent
to train the local defence force volunteers, has never been found.
He failed to board a steamer returning his party to base after a
social event, and was officially declared missing.
An inquest recorded an open verdict.

Ruling rejected by Cabinet
THE Government is to consider defying a European court ruling
condemning the killing of three IRA terrorists by the SAS on Gibraltar
seven years ago, shootings which the court said had been unjustified .
Ministers, angry at the ''incomprehensible'' decision, may refuse to
pay the ''fine'' of #38,700 in legal costs.
There will be no review of security services' methods. ''We shall do
absolutely nothing,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine.
One cause for relief was the ''muted'' response of the Irish
Government. The Northern Ireland peace process appears not to be at
risk, although Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams again took the opportunity
to warn that the Government was endangering it by its stance on IRA
weapons.
The fact that the Prime Minister asked his deputy to deliver a
forceful British reaction indicates the feeling of the Cabinet, which
was gathered yesterday to consider public expenditure.
Mr Heseltine said: ''The idea that we are going to sit here and say we
are in some way going to accept blame for what is the most awful
responsibility in fighting terrorism, is inconceivable.'' He added, in a
series of interviews: ''We will pursue our right to fight terrorism, to
protect innocent people wherever we have jurisdiction. We will not be
swayed or deterred in any way by this ludicrous decision of the court.''
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew, who is in New Zealand,
said in a radio interview: ''It's a bit ironic, isn't it, that we have
Sinn Fein bringing proceedings in a court of human rights. What human
rights do the IRA give anyone? They don't accord anyone a trial, let
alone a right of appeal.''
However, the decision of the court is binding on the Government and
there is no right of appeal. It was not immediately clear what, if any,
sanctions the court possessed if the Government refused to comply.
Labour's spokesman Jack Straw declared that Britain must accept the
court's ruling and this started a party dog-fight, with Mr Heseltine
accusing Labour of sending a ''triumphant signal to terrorists''.
Mr Straw was last night writing to Mr Heseltine demanding he withdraw
comments suggesting that Mr Straw had given ''encouragement to the
terrorist mentality''. Mr Straw described the remarks as a ''disgraceful
slur'' and warned that, unless the Deputy Prime Minister apologised, he
would have to consider legal action.
Mr Heseltine later retorted: ''It is not a disgraceful slur. He said
we should accept the findings of the court in spirit and in letter. If
that isn't part of a process that has seen a whole range of people
sympathetic to the terrorists, coming out with statements, encouraging
full inquiries, I don't know what is.''
It was in the European Court of Human Rights that the Government's
seven-year attempt to justify the SAS's ''execution-style'' killings
during the so-called ''shoot to kill'' campaign finally failed narrowly.
By the odd vote in 19, the judges found in favour of the families of
the three dead terrorists, but withheld compensation because the IRA
''active service unit'' was planning to plant a car bomb at the time.
The crucial passage of the judgment -- dismissed by the Government as
''incomprehensible'' and ''defying common sense'' -- found that the SAS
men's action ''lacked the degree of caution in the use of firearms to be
expected from law enforcement personnel in a democratic society, even
when dealing with dangerous terrorist suspects''.
The judges decided they were not persuaded that the killings
''constituted a use of force which was no more than absolutely necessary
in defence of persons from unlawful violence . . .''
They also found no evidence that the four soldiers, whose identities
have never been made public, were under orders to kill. The court blamed
the soldiers' superiors for poor planning and failing to pass on full
intelligence. It questioned why the three terrorists had been allowed to
enter Gibraltar in the first place and not stopped at the Spanish
border.
''The court accepts that the soldiers honestly believed, in the light
of the information that they had been given, that it was necessary to
shoot the suspects in order to prevent them from detonating a bomb and
causing serious loss of life,'' the judges decided.
Britain had always argued that the SAS prevented massive loss of life
by shooting the three terrorists in what it described as ''prompt and
effective action''. Mairead Farrell died from eight bullets, Danny
McCann from five and Sean Savage was struck by 16.
The shoot-to-kill approach was allegedly approved by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and close Cabinet colleagues, but the court's findings
did not support that view.
It was not the first time that Britain has been infuriated by the
findings of the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights, -- last
month it ruled that gypsies be permitted to settle where they like --
but it may be the last.
Immense pressure is building up in the Tory Party and Government to
withdraw from the institution, which Britain helped to found in 1959 to
counter abuses behind the Iron Curtain. Former Chancellor Norman Lamont
and defeated leadership challenger John Redwood last night added their
voices to the demands for withdrawal.
Mr Major has to decide whether to pay, as ordered, the #38,700 legal
costs of the families of the dead. If he ignores his party's mood of
defiance, he will face trouble at next month's Tory conference and when
the Commons returns next month.
The court's judgment, overturning previous ones, that the British
Government acted unlawfully, has revived the passions of Tory MPs
concerned about loss of sovereignty.
The Government is found guilty of lack of care in planning and
controlling the action seven years ago. The IRA ''active service'' dead
were believed to be about to detonate a remote-controlled bomb during a
British Army parade.
Mr Adams and other republicans were triumphant at the court's
decision, renewing demands for a full inquiry. Mr Adams last night
widened the issue, warning that the Government had no Northern Ireland
peace strategy and threatened to destroy efforts to find peace. He said
the demand for a decommissioning of IRA weapons, what he called an IRA
surrender, was ''irresponsible and impossible''.
The Dublin Government has been cautious, responding only that it
accepts the judgment of the European court. Nevertheless Irish political
nerves, north and south of the border, are on edge again after the Prime
Minister had encouraging talks with Unionists and nationalists at No 10
only the day before.
The Unionists are appalled. The Rev Ian Paisley, the Democratic
Unionist leader, advised Mr Major to ''cock a snook'' at the court. Mr
David Trimble, the new leader of the Ulster Unionists, said that the
decision would ''strike dismay into all police forces in Europe''. His
security spokesman Mr Ken Maginnis called the judgment an ''absolute
mockery''.
Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland Minister responsible for trying to
arrange all-party peace talks, was pleased that there was only one
finding against Britain, and that one defied common sense.
''In our view many lives were saved by the action taken. There was no
evidence taken by the court, and I believe that where the finding was
against us it defies common sense.''
A growing number of Tory MPs now want out of the European Court of
Human Rights, although it has no official connection with the European
Union. They are already worried that European law has taken over from
the sovereignty of British courts.
